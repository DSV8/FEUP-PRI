Works with popular 1st and 3rd person titles such as Call of Duty - Advanced Warfare, Battlefield, Gears of War, Titanfall, Destiny, Halo and 100s more.  The HipShotDot replaces or enhances your in game sights. In a game like Call of Duty, the HipShotDot enables you to change out your in game red dot sight with an additional attachment, ultimately giving you the advantage over the competition.  The HipShotDot is compatible with virtually any game system including popular consoles such as Xbox 360, Xbox ONE, PS3, PS4, Wii and WiiU. Works with 100s of 1st and 3rd person shooter games including popular titles such as Call of Duty, Battlefield, Metal of Honor, Titanfall, Halo, Gears of War, The Division, Destiny and many more.

You may also power the HipShotDot with a standard USB power supply, i.e. phone charger or available USB port on your television. The power indicator on the HipShotDot's USB connector and red dot sight will illuminate.  During gameplay, simply zoom in and attach the HipShotDot to the television to align with the cross hairs/sights of your weapon. Slide the secondary suction cup down the cord to the edge of the television and attach to hold the wire straight and taught. There is a quick release designed into both suction cups for easy removal. To remove the HipShotDot after gameplay, simply pull the HipShotDot wire below the secondary suction cup in an upward motion.  The HipShotDot is not an aim bot, it will not aim for you. It simply gives you a full time red dot sight attachment in games where you typically do not. Experience increased hip fire, quick-scope and no-scoping accuracy. Leverage the advantage of an additional attachment over the competition.  FOLLOW ME IN THESE PLACES FOR UPDATES Twitter -  Facebook -  Instagram -  Google Plus -",

    "description": "The Pixel 2 XL has a different manufacture than the normal sized Pixel 2. Does that make the durability different as well? There is only one way to find out, and thats by putting the Pixel 2 XL through the same durability tests as the Pixel 2.  Lets find out what the phone is made out of, and if we can expect the Pixel 2 XL to withstand the test of time.

    "transcript": "Ive had a lot of requests for the Pixel 2 XL. When a new phone is released, I dont normally test both sizes since they are usually made by the same company and the structure and materials are the same. But when Google makes phones, they divvy out the phone construction and the Pixel XL has a different manufacturer than the regular size Pixel. So, the construction is different. Google has approved both versions of the phone though, and slapped their name on it. So, if anything goes wrong down the road, Google should be the one to take care of it. Lets test the Pixel 2 XL. [Intro] Ill admit I was a little mean in my regular sized Pixel 2 video. I dont take back anything I said of course, but I will try to point out a few benefits of the Pixel lineup during this video. Google has advertised Gorilla Glass 5 on this 6-inch OLED display, which you already know scratches at a level 6, with a deeper groove at a level 7 all verified here by my buddy Moh. One big perk of owning the Pixel 2 phone is the front firing stereo speakers. If your face is always pointed towards the screen, the sound should also point right back toward your face, just like with the TV or at a movie theater. It just makes sense. And the Pixel 2 has that. The speaker grills are made from a thinner style of metal screen, but it is secure and its better than the white cloth that we saw last year. So thumbs up for that. The front camera is protected under the front glass of the screen. Down here on the back of the phone, we have our branding the letter G. Now, the old Nexus phones had a problem with the Nexus lettering falling out of the back plastic. This metal G is inlayed and glued pretty hard into that G slot in the back of the phone. Even digging at it with my razor blade, it was difficult to remove, so I really doubt its ever going to fall out on its own. Now the back surface of the phone is the same material we saw on the Pixel 2 and can be scuffed up by keys. This coating, or thick paint on the phone, is very similar to plastic. And the marks are permanent they dont rub away or disappear like we saw on the anodized aluminum like we saw on the OnePlus 5T. Its very important to never put phone and keys in the same pocket or purse. Using the Mohs picks on the back of the phone, we start seeing very permanent damage at a level 3 same level of hardness that plastic has. But you know, if you treat your phone extremely well, or put a case on it like a normal person, you wont have to worry about any of that. One huge perk of owning a Pixel phone is unlimited quality storage or pictures and videos online, up until the end of 2020. After that you still get to keep what youve uploaded, but the deal only continues to include nonoriginal quality picture storage after that. So it is a great thing, but it doesnt last foreverkind of like the dinosaurs. Rex was looking a little too much like Barney over here, so I added some teeth, and now hes looking a little betteryou know, art class with Jerry stuff. The coating applied to the back of the phone wraps equally along the sides, and it feels good and looks really goodeven if it is a bit softer than normal metal with glass that we normally see on flagships. The same thick paint covers the volume rocker and power buttons. The razor blade of truth exposes the metal underneath both buttons which is interesting because the color button on the Kinda Blue Pixel 2 was plastic. Once again, plastic is not a bad thing, its just good to know what is where. Speaking of what is where, the headphone jack is still not here, but hey, if youre into that kind of thing, party on. I just hope your party speakers are all Bluetooth. The camera is also something that Google excels with, combining all that portrait mode stuff into one pretty high-quality sensor is quite the feat, and it is protected with real glass and has a metal lip surrounding the lens. Ive heard a lot of good things about this camera. The fingerprint scanner can still get scratched up. Its not ceramic or anything like we saw on the OnePlus 5T. But this time around the fingerprint scanner does keep working after my abuse. So if the scratches are all superficial, it should still function. The Pixel 2 XL screen lasted 10 seconds under the heat from my flame, and its interesting to note that the regular size 2 lasted 15 seconds. I honestly dont think this 5 second difference has any indication of potential burning between display manufacturers, it just could be the angle o f my flame. I would need to burn quite a few more Pixels to test this theory, but its still kind of interesting. Maybe someday well find an actual use for this burn test. And now the bend test, checking the structural integrity of the phone. The Pixel 2s water-resistance was compromised by a badly placed antenna line that cracked and could separate under pressure. With this Pixel 2 XL, there is some minor flex, but there is no splitting along the frame of the phone when bent from the front or the back. It remains solid. Heres another quick look at the weak point on the Pixel 2. Keep in mind that the weak point isnt a deal breaker. A phone would be totally fine under normal circumstances. Its the accidents and the abnormal circumstances that we are planning for here with my videos. And, judging by the look of it, the Pixel 2 XL is a little bit better prepared for the abuse cellphones sometimes endure. The main thing to watch out for with the Pixel XL is the plasticky paint coating thats a bit softer than metal. But, with a little protection on your very expensive investment, like a case or a skin, and youll be just fine for a pretty long time. While this phone isnt going to be my daily driver, its still going to be a really good phone for a lot of people. Let me know what phone you want to see tested here next on my channel. Rex wants you to subscribe to my future videos, and he thanks you a ton for watching. Well see you around.",

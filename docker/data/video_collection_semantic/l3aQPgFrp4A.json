    "transcript": "this is the Google Nexus 5 remember the smartphone guys it was launched roughly four years ago and it's sold like hotcakes I remember this device going in and out of stock in a fish of Google Playstore and the sole reason for that is because people really liked what it offer for the price there were two storage variants for this device so 16 gigabytes and 32 gigabytes priced at 349 and 399 USD think about it actually that's me that makes me wonder how far we've come in terms of pricing for Android smartphone these days take this baseline Google pixel to for instance it currently retails for 649 dollars that's $300 more compared to the baseline Nexus 5 now obviously it's not fair to compare both these smartphones but we're really starting to pay a premium for Android devices these days especially if you're looking to get the latest and greatest in terms of specs features camera performance and you know basically a whole round package that was not the case with the Nexus 5 it was it was a relatively you know decent hardware but with a great software experience back then what I really appreciated about Google was their ability to offer the best of Android at a relatively affordable price point clean version of Android and no bloatware was the best software experience this was a great buy back then but eventually Google sort of dissolved the Nexus branding and they moved on to the pixel lineup and as always you know smartphones are not meant to last year longer the performance degrades the battery life degrades the camera performance well let's say it's not gonna compete with today's standards but you know what for fun sakes I decided to use this device for a single day and just see how it actually is holding up because it's fun just revisiting tech from back then so let me walk you through my experience run it for this wondering how to fix a boring fan check out halos RGB there are super slim fan frames that light up your blades of any shade come on 120 and 140 memory sizes to fit any fan and a control through your motherboard or your fan text case available in beautiful aluminum or simple plastic it's time to Halos your build outline what matters all right so the first thing that I noticed is just how well this thing has held up over time from a structural standpoint that is this is in mind by the way in fact if you've been following our channel for a while you we have noticed Mike aka sky MTL our boss yeah so this is his smartphone and he's taking care of it pretty well I can see that he hasn't used a case and the rear side of the phone really does show some where the screen has a few scratches but it's nothing major no cracks or any weird marks he's done a really good job taking care of the phone so good job Mike the 5-inch 1080p IPS display still functions it's nice and sharp colors are on point viewing angles are still excellent considering the panel technology it's obviously not super vibrant when compared to the AMOLED panel and the contrast ratio might be a little off but honestly I'd still consume content on the Nexus 5 because it works and it's still good however be prepared to use a pair of headphones while consuming content because the integrated speakers are pretty terrible in fact it was one of the downside to the Nexus 5 in the first place I can definitely notice distortions at higher volumes handling might have been a cause for that but I'm not exactly sure the button still feel nice and tactile and they're still functional so overall from a build quality standpoint I'm really impressed with how far the Nexus 5 has held up now for my drive today I'll be using the Nexus 5 for navigation of a few places to go to unfortunately I wasn't able to load my SIM card to this device because the Nexus 5 supports Micro SIM and not nano SIM that's on my pixel too and I don't have an adapter that can support it so I'm just gonna be using the hotspot method for navigation I've installed my most frequently used apps like Instagram Twitter and a few more of course I'll be consuming content for the rest of the day on this device so let's just see how that goes okay so I ran out of battery on the Nexus 5 it was I was coming it was kind of expected because you know over time the battery life degrades on any smartphone I was able to get run an hour and maybe an hour and a half worth it being on time on this guy I just watching YouTube videos and of course navigating through the city so I think you know it holds up pretty well you definitely have to carry a power bank especially if you're rocking a Nexus 5 right now I'm pretty sure you'll be rocking in power bank with you while you're on the go also it's really cold here in Toronto I mean it's a mini April and it's like freezing so I'm gonna go back to my car yeah okay so my cable drawer is a little bit of a mess and I don't think I do have any micro USB cables lying around here so I mean actually hold on I think oh yeah this works this is actually the one that I used to charge the Corsair glaive RGB Mouse it's a wireless mouse so it charges via microUSB so it's perfect for the Nexus 5 because I ran out of battery on this guy so let's plug it in so the softer experience is fairly straightforward on the Nexus 5 at lunch it came with Android 4.4 KitKat if I'm not mistaken I really do miss those days guys but over time Google did roll out updates until 6.0 marshmallow and it ended support for the device after that currently it's rocking 6.0.1 and from just a day worth of usage it's pretty smooth it definitely suffers a multitasking especially if you have a ton of apps running in the background and this makes sense because it's running a four-year-old CPU in this case these Snapdragon 800 with 2 gigabytes of RAM but just for casual stuff it gets the job done really well I mean I was able to watch youtube videos TV shows and Netflix check social media and I'm really surprised at how well it handles those apps I'll be it not as fast as modern smartphone these days but you get the point one of the cool advantages of running stock Android on a device like this is just the way how Google has optimized the apps to run on the hardware so back then you know has it started with 4.4 KitKat Google has optimized the apps they've improved the performance and just a way how they've handled things in the background and so far it just works the app I mean app support is still present I'm pretty sure most apps on the Play Store still support and can still run on the Nexus 5 because it's running 6.0.1 and it certainly meets the requirements for most apps in the Play Store which is great I think one of the devices that competed with the Nexus 5 back then was the HTC One in fact my very first Android smartphone was the Google Play edition HTC One it was sold directly by Google it's to receive constant updates over time and I absolutely loved my experience with it came with great build quality fantastic build quality if you ask me and just overall I felt a lot more superior compared to the Nexus 5 yet it offered the best of Google coming to think of it why aren't we seeing Google Play edition devices on smartphone these days I would love to see a Google Play edition galaxy s 9 Google Play edition LG G 6 or something like that it would be really awesome I mean think about it you've got great design software experience would be just amazing on these devices you can only wish so the last thing that I wanted to test it was the camera on the Nexus 5 it features an eID megapixel sensor with an F 2.4 aperture comes with OS which is incredible and looking at these shots I'm actually really impressed with how well this thing takes pictures I left all the settings in auto mode with HDR plus turned on it takes a few seconds to process the image but man I really respect what what what this phone does I mean it's great the dynamic range is actually pretty good on this camera you're obviously not gonna get the best detail out of this when compared to you know something like a pixel and it's not a fair comparison but at least you know 2018 a phone like this which is 4 years old I'm really impressed but I'd love to hear your thoughts on the quality what do you guys think about it now I have some trouble getting the sensor to focus in low-light conditions I think it must be an optics error or something like that I'm not exactly sure but overall I'm actually really impressed for a 4-year old smartphone so that's the story with the Nexus 5 guys I definitely had a lot of fun revisiting this device in 2018 and I'm surprised at how well it's still holding up apps still work great and let me know in the comments down below if any of you guys are still rocking one of these devices and now it's been working out with you but yeah that's about it thank you so much for watching I'm Eber with Hardware Canucks and once see you in the next one",

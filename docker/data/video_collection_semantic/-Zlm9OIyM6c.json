    "transcript": "here you go my friend the rival 650 another wireless mouse yep it's the best one so far yeah but you always say that well see for yourself all right ha this thing is pretty damn good let's review right to this the new fatality h370 performance motherboard is well-equipped for agent processors with 10 power phase design dual ultra and a two slots for storage and fantastic audio interface and dual RGB headers for addressable and 12 volt lighting accessories check out the full asrock 300 series line up down below alright guys so I'm extremely happy to see a quality wireless mouse from Steelseries so they can compete in the marketplace but mainly to compete with Logitech who have held this really dominant position in the wireless space and so the rival 650 is just basically a wireless iteration of the rival 600 you can check out that review over here and of course because it's wireless we have a nice price premium that comes with that at the hundred twenty dollars compared to $80 for the wired version as usual I will leave my favorite wireless and wired mice in the description below check them out so you can get your game on now the main competitor to the rival 650 right now I think would be the G Pro Wireless which cost $150 so it's slightly more expensive so I can see where this would tie in but the main disadvantage with the rival 650 is the weight at 121 grams it is significantly heavier than the G Pro Wireless which is only 80 grams but on top of that this has actual weight customization in four gram increments so you can install four little weights on each side to give you a total of 153 grams if you prefer a heavier Mouse and all the unused weights can be stored inside this rubber housing that you can wrap around let's say you keyboard cable so you don't lose it you could look at it as an advantage versus the G pro Wireless if you prefer heavier mice if you play at a really high DPI and prefer to have the mouse that is grounded to the mouse mat and to access that internal weight system you simply pull off these magnetic side plates and you need to apply a little bit of force so don't worry about them popping off while you're gaming that will never happen and you simply install the weights on these little rubber cavities once you pull off the magnetic plates usually the weights fall out as well because while they're pretty secure inside they they tend to kind of get loosened up while the mouse is an and weight wise compared to the rival 600 we have an additional 25 grams here because of that battery so if you want even the lighter mouse but prefer the shape and the customization over here you can definitely check out the rival 600 in terms of build quality it feels absolutely identical to the rival 600 super satisfying rubber texture on the entire body and really grippy sections on each side to kind of lock your grip the mouse wheel I would say is best in the business super satisfying scroll steps good texture nice middle click as well that's light enough to press but that thin button to change your DPI is still a little bit too high for me and it's still slightly higher than the rival 310 which I prefer it's low profile because every time I press the middle click I also activate that dpi shift the primary buttons have that complementing curvature so if fingers just fall in place and the actual clicks are incredible the browser buttons are in perfect position low profile and nice depression what that actuation happens and we have a third button in the front that the slightly difficult to reach but you could program a macro in there that you don't normally use but whenever you need to you simply readjust your grip to get to it and so for my hybrid grip style absolutely no problem here a super comfortable Mouse claw grip would work very well as well and for smaller hands palm grip will be absolutely no problem however I do prefer the slightly shorter body of the rival 310 that has a slightly more aggressive slant on the right side versus here but I'm guessing it just something I've gotten used to because I've been using that Mouse since it launched of course we have RGB illumination over here it's pretty but for a wireless mouse definitely disable it to preserve battery life and at the bottom we have something unique to SteelSeries two sensors one is for tracking the other is for lift off distance so the tracking sensor here is the same as with the rival 600 the true move 3 plus amazing tracking over here true one-to-one performance throughout the entire CPI range up to 12,000 CPI and the second sensor detects your liftoff distance so you can really adjust that based on your surface level based on your play style so that you have absolutely no Mouse you know judor when the mouse is placed down or when you lift it it is really cool to play around with the liftoff distance setting and see when the sensor stops tracking on my mouse mat because I've used that mouse mat for years and there are certain depressions that I'm guessing have been made because of my hand whenever the mouse goes over those sections there's no tracking or it's very like kind of jerky and that is because the sensor is picking up the unevenness of that really flat mouse mat and that's pretty incredible of course that could be seen as a disadvantage as well so just make sure to fine-tune the lift up distance for your particular Mouse man and at the bottom we have a power button with color coordination plus a connect toggle so you can sync that with the USB receiver that this pretty small has little ridges so you can pull that out from your computer easily but there is no way to store the receiver on the mouse itself unlike with the G Pro Wireless that has the little compartment at the bottom of the mouse which would have been pretty nice to have with a rival 650 and so my gaming experience with the rival 650 given its fantastic economics and credible buttons and an awesome sensor was satisfactory but remember this is a hundred and twenty-one grams which is 25 grams heavier than the rival 600 and I prefer my mice around 90 gram weights so I've been kind of spoiled by the G Pro Wireless which is 80 grams and the rival 310 which is 88 grams I think so gaming with something slightly heavier was definitely weird there is that adjustment period where you kind of get to know how you have to flick and how you have to perform in games so that you can be back to feeling super comfortable with your crosshair and ignoring exactly where it will land based on how much movement you have you know in the physical world and though you know after a few gaming sessions I was pretty comfortable gaming with something that heavy but without the wire it definitely gives you that freedom of movement on the mousepad first please now in terms of battery performance you know you can't expect miracles when you're dealing with something of this caliber but you can expect at least 24 hours of continuous usage so that is what three five days minimum of game time and when I plugged it into my motherboard I charged 14 percent in 15 minutes which is pretty good but if you plug into a fast charging port on your motherboard SteelSeries claims you'll get additional 10 hours of battery life in just 15 minutes and that is where the G Pro Wireless has an advantage this thing can last for 60 hours without any illumination with that constant usage and 48 hours with some illumination versus 24 on the arrival 650 and so for conclusion I want to say that the rival 650 is a needed introduction to the market to compete with the likes of the G Pro Wireless because while that has a spot in the market for really competitive scenes and for people who love light or mice like myself the rival 650 is that opposite kind of alternative to people who want something heavier with more weight customization and having that really precise fine tuning for that depth sensor for that lift off distance adjustment plus there's that $30 price advantage with the rival 650 versus the G Pro Wireless and now you've been wanting to cut the cord and have that freedom of movement on the mouse mat the rival 650 is a fantastic alternative to basically all the wireless mice that are available right now for gaming of this caliber and it deserves the Hardware Canucks DAM GOOD award as always I will list all my favorite mice in description below wired and wireless options in there so you can check them out make sure to see this other relevant content

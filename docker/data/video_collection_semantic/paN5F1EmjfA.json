    "transcript": "This is a Raspberry Pi 5 and in this video I'm going to show you how to install Kali Linux one of my favorite operating systems on a Raspberry Pi. Big shout out to Steev one of the Kali developers specifically for arm architectures who sent me a pre-release version of Kali so that I could create this video. Hopefully by the time you watch this video it will be available on the Kali website. I'm going to show you all the steps to get Kali up and running on a Raspberry Pi 5 and then attack Wi-Fi networks. One of the caveats is that the Raspberry Pi 5 built-in Wi-Fi adapter does not support monitoring and packet injection so you need to use an external Wi-Fi adapter but I'll show you how to do that in this video. Okay without further Ado let me show you how to get Kali up and running on a Raspberry Pi 5. First thing you need to do is go to the kali.org website and click download select ARM as the architecture and notice right at the top we've got Raspberry Pi at the time of this recording it's 2, 3, 4 and 400 hopefully 5 will will be there by the time you watch this video otherwise you just need to wait a bit longer I'm going to click on the download link to download the software to my computer. As you can see here I've got the Raspberry Pi 5 software already downloaded but you would simply click save to download that to your computer and once it's downloaded we'll use the Rasberry Pi software to install it on an SD card so go to raspberrypi.org click on software scroll down and click download for Windows at the time of this recording the imager software is 1.8.1 that's the software that we need to get to install the Operating System on the SD card. So I'm going to open that click yes to run it and what you'll notice now is when I click install and run the software that we have the option to choose a device so unlike previous versions of the imager software we now have Raspberry Pi 5 or Raspberry Pi 4 and various other Raspberry Pi's listed here so I'm going to choose Raspberry Pi 5 I'm going to choose the Operating System. Now you could install Raspberry Pi OS or you could install other general purpose Operating Systems like Ubuntu but I'm not going to do that I'm going to scroll down and use a custom image and the image I'm going to select is this Raspberry Pi software. The previous version will not work I've tested that you need to have the latest version of the Operating System. So I'm going to click open I need to choose storage at the moment nothing is displayed because you need an SD card try and get a decent sized SD card at least 16 gig on the documentation they say that you need a Micro SD card with at least 16 gig capacity this is the documentation for Raspberry Pi 4 I haven't seen the documentation for Raspberry Pi 5 yet but I'm using a much larger SD card 64 gig. So SD cards are fairly cheap these days so look at getting for instance a 32 gig or something. So I'll insert that in my computer and you can see that it's now available and I can select that so once again all I did was select my SD card and then I can click next. So as an example you may want to enable SSH so that you can SSH directly into the Raspberry Pi. You could also specify options such as the Wi-Fi so those are great options if you for instance don't have the Raspberry Pi connected to a monitor and you just want to connect to it remotely I'm not going to bother with that because I want to show you the initial bootup so I'm going to say no to custom settings. We're told that all existing data on the SD card will be erased, are we sure that we want to continue? And the answer is yes. Okay so now you can see that it's writing to the SD card I'm going to speed up the video at this point because this is going to take a while to install for you go and get a coffee or something another now's a good time to take a break. But now through the power of editing and there you go we told that Kali 2023.3 has been written to the SD card so we can remove it so I'll click continue remove the SD card and then insert it into the Raspberry Pi. So there you go now inserted what I'll do now is connect the keyboard and mouse to the Raspberry Pi and connect a monitor in this case I'm using OBS on my laptop so that we can see what's going on and last thing to do is connect power to the Raspberry Pi so I'll do that and we should hopefully hear that the fan starts up and there it does not sure if you can hear that but it's now spinning and we can see that Raspberry Pi is booting on the laptop. So Raspberry Pi is now running at the moment it's not able to connect to a network because I haven't connected it to a network I could as an example connect it to a physical Network I didn't configure the Wi-Fi previously but just for this example I'll connect it via Ethernet and there you go Kali has booted on a Raspberry Pi 5 default username is kali default password is the same so kali press enter and I'm able to log in. Okay so what I'll do is open up a terminal as you can see the terminal dis displays kali@kaliraspberry-pi-5 and if I use the command ip address I can see that I've been allocated an IP address on the Ethernet0 Port the Wi-Fi adapter has been picked up but it's not currently connected we'll do that in a second but as an example hopefully I'll be able to ping google.com which I can I can clear the screen and do a sudo apt update to update my references. References are being updated okay so references have now been updated successfully. What I can do as an example is go to the Wi-Fi networks and then I could as an example connect to a Wi-Fi network but rather than me for instance connecting to the free Wi-Fi let's see if we can actually attack the free Wi-Fi network and get the password. Now just a disclaimer before we continue only attack Wi-Fi networks that you own or have permission to attack I own this wi-fi network and I'm giving myself permission to attack my own Wi-Fi network using this Alfa network adapter it's really important that you understand Wi-Fi technologies and the vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi networks but do it ethically. So a simple way to test Wi-Fi capability is to use wifite. So I'm going to use the command sudo wifite what you'll notice is it says that no interfaces can be put into monitor mode. So WLAN0 using this broadcom chipset doesn't support monitor mode wifite tried to put the interface into monitor mode but that failed so even though the Raspberry Pi 5 has a built-in Wi-Fi adapter it doesn't support monitor mode and injection by default at the moment maybe that'll be fixed later this is typically a problem with the broadcom chipsets on the Raspberry Pi these days so that didn't work. So what I'll do now is use an Alfa network adapter this is my new favorite Alfa network adapter I'll link it below if you're interested it supports Wi-Fi 6E so 802.11 ax so very very nice adapter so I'll open that and what it does have is a USBC to USBA connector now I just have to do this because of YouTube rules Alfa sent me this adapter I didn't get paid to use the adapter I've bought many many of the adapters myself but they have given me this adapter I need to clarify that for the video but I'll plug that in and hopefully I'll now be able to see that as an interface. So I'll just use the command iwconfig so we can see Wi-Fi interfaces what you'll see there is we've got WLAN0 and WLAN1. So two Wi-Fi interfaces and then what I'll do now is use the command sudo wifite to run it again and as you can see there we have got another Wi-Fi adapter as well as the broadcom Wi-Fi adapter. Now important note I didn't have to install any drivers on Kali to see this I simply plugged it in so I'll press two it's now enabled monitor mode on that Wi-Fi adapter and I see a whole bunch of Wi-Fi networks so what I'll do is press Control C here to stop the Wi-Fi attack and I'll choose five our free Wi-Fi network let's see if we can attack that. Now it's trying various attacks against the Wi-Fi network people often complain about this wifite shows WPA but it's actually WPA2 that's running on that access point so it tries to do various things to deauth clients so what I'll do is use my phone to connect to that Network and I'll put in the password so a handshake has been captured now okay so the Raspberry Pi captured the handshake between the phone and the Wi-Fi access point using this external Wi-Fi adapter but it's hanging at the moment and that's because I didn't do something that I should have done in the beginning. Right at the top here we're told that hcxdumptool wasn't found the hcxpcap tool was not found so we need to run these two commands apt install hcxdumptool and apt install hcxtools so make sure that you run those two commands I've actually run them now so simply use the command sudo apt install hcxdumptool as you can see it's now installed and then we need to use this command apt install htxtools so sudo apt install hcxtools that's now been installed. So if I run Wi-Fi again what you'll notice is it tells us that the interface is in monitor mode I'll run the attack against the free Wi-Fi network now it's trying to run thePMKID attack so I'm going to stop that and say C to continue now because I previously captured the handshake so it found the file in the HCS directory it was able to use that captured file and get the password password. This is an example of a really bad password you don't want to use a password like spiderman you want to use a good password rather than a bad password like that but notice I was able to capture the handshake and then crack the password because it was an easy password so if I go into the HCS directory and use LS notice there is the handshake I could remove that as an example so sudo rm handshake let's delete that so that's gone now CD run wifite again a good option to use is kill so sudo wifite --kill to kill any conflicting processes. Interfaces in monitor mode again control C I'll select the free Wi-Fi network PMKID attack I'm going to stop that say C to continue it's looking for a handshake so on my client which is connected to that Wi-Fi network notice it captured or discovered the client so what I'll do is connect back to that Wi-Fi network and there you go it's captured the hand handshake and was able to crack it again very very quickly because the password is really bad. This is the word list that it's using don't use bad passwords but there you go I've now shown you how to install Kali Linux on a Raspberry Pi 5 and use an adapter such as this which gives you the ability to connect to both 2.4 as well as 5 GHz Wi-Fi networks rather than just the traditional 2.4 GHz that you often see in videos. Fantastic adapter this again Alfa Network are not paying me to say this but they did give me this Wi-Fi adapter this is probably my favorite new Wi-Fi adapter at the moment works out of the box with Kali you don't have to install any extra software and it supports both 2.4 as well as 5 GHz as well as Wi-Fi 6E which is fantastic So great adapter my new favorite Wi-Fi adapter for testing Wi-Fi networks. Okay so I hope you enjoyed this video if you did please like it please consider subscribing to my YouTube channel and clicking on the bell to get notifications I'm David Bombal and I want to wish you all the very best.",

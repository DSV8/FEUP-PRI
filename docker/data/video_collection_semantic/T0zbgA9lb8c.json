    "description": "After a few days learning about home tech in Modern Dad's home and studio, MrMobile was feeling restless. So we mashed together all the cool stuff in Modern Dad's tech inventory with the new gadgets MrMobile brought with him and struck out for the far reaches of Pensacola to test them out! In this edition of Top Notch Tech, Michael and Phil climb a lighthouse with the Withings Steel HR, clamber over some fighter jets with the GoPro Hero 5, endure a thunderstorm with the Casio WSD-F20, and see how much weight they lost (and blood pressure they gained) with some smart health accessories back in the studio. Join us for our second collaboration and see if any of this top notch tech is for you!

    "transcript": "- Hi Phil. - Hello Mr. Mobile. - Hello Modern, hello Mr. Mom. - Do you get mad if I call you Fisher instead of Mobile? - No, do you get mad if I call you Florida dad? - Nah. - Yay. - That's me. - Good. So the last time we hung out we learned all kinds of things about home tech. - Yes. - Like shower curtains that double as smart mini van shammies and things like that. Yeah, we learned a lot of fun stuff. We learned about living around the home, but I needed to get out, so we did. - [Phil] Yes. - [Mr. Mobile] We saw a whole bunch of Pensacola, we saw a whole lot of Florida, we saw a lot of thunderstorms, we saw a lot of dope stuff, using a lot of cool tech. - [Phil] We went somewhere actually I hadn't been before, which was up in the lighthouse at Pensacola Naval Air Station. I've lived here my whole life, never gone. - [Mr. Mobile] Most ridiculous thing. And that gave us the opportunity to test both fitness tech and camera tech. - [Phil] Yep. And my calves. - [Mr. Mobile] And, yeah. Modern Dad. - Mr. Mobile? - What is this? - This is the Anker PowerPort Solar. - What does it do? - It charges things, via solar. - So, we open it up and it folds into a trifold. Oh, and then we have 15 watts max. Two solar panels on here. Little plug-in, charge thing on the inside. It's not a battery, so this actively charges whatever you plug into it. - [Mr. Mobile] That being said, like most solar chargers. - [Phil] You're not gonna max it out, yeah. - [Mr. Mobile] You're not gonna get anywhere close to that, unless you're doing things which I didn't know you had to do, like angle the solar panels according to your latitude. There's apparently like a formula for that. - [Phil] Yeah, I mean, this is not something I would use everday. But if we go to the beach, I don't want to have a battery that's just baking in the sun all day, and I kind of like the idea of just charging when I need to. It's handy. It's 50 bucks. - [Mr. Mobile] How much does it cost? 50 bucks? - Yeah, 50 dollars. A nice little backup and, I can, hey, wee. - This next thing that Phil is putting on now is something that I do not think I have ever spoken positively of, until now. This is the, how do you pronounce it? Withings? - [Phil] Withings. - [Mr. Mobile] Withings Steel HR? - [Phil] Yes. - [Mr. Mobile] It's not much more than a watch, but it is a bit more than a watch. They don't do a lot, do they? - [Phil] So, I mean, it's a weird hybrid. It's not quite a normal, analog watch. - [Mr. Mobile] But it's not quite a full smart watch. - [Phil] But it's not a full smart watch, and that's actually what I like about it. It's a nice little in between, it's got a normal looking face, so I can easily see what time it is. - [Mr. Mobile] Yes. - [Phil] It doesn't have a big display, just sucking down battery life, and that's probably the biggest thing. You only have to charge this, you know, once every couple weeks. - [Mr. Mobile] Which is crazy. And the other thing that got my attention is when you put this on, it's actually really attractive. - It's not huge. There are two sizes. - Yep. - You're wearing the 36 millimeter, I've got the 40 millimeter. It's got a little bezzle around the side. Same exact functionality. - [Mr. Mobile] Same functionality, which is that you click in to the button it gives you heart rate, it gives you step count, it gives you distance, and it gives you alarms. - [Phil] It does basic, basic messaging functionality, notifications, so if somebody calls you, that'll show up on here. If you get a text message, calendar alerts. So, real basic stuff, but what I like is I wear this at the gym. You can wear it all the time if you want. It totally works as an everyday watch. - Except when you're climbing a lighthouse. - [Phil] Yes. - [Mr. Mobile] Which we will talk about more in a second. - [Phil] 177 steps. - [Mr. Mobile] It really does not give you credit for all those steps, and when you're huffing and puffing, you want every one of those steps counted. 64 steps? BS. How much is this? - This is, the 36 is about 180 dollars. 40 millimeter is, I think, 20 dollars more. - [Mr. Mobile] If you ask me, still a lot to ask for such a limited product. - [Phil] It's a lot of money. Yep. - [Mr. Mobile] But I have warmed up to it a little. - [Phil] And, by the way, water resistant. You can wear it in the pool. - [Mr. Mobile] Oh yeah, that's nice. - [Phil] And when you put it in workout mode, it will try to guess what it is you're doing. So, if you're swimming it'll say oh hey, we think you were swimming. We'll sync that over for you automatically. You don't have to figure out what it is you were doing in the app. As long as we're talking Withings. I'm a big fan of ecosystems, right? If you're gonna get one fitness thing, kind of stay in that ecosystem, you're gonna get the most out of it. - This is like something that I would never have paid attention to, had I not come down here. - And, you know, I wouldn't have done it had I not been getting old. Put it on here, hit the button, takes your blood pressure in like 30 seconds. - [Mr. Mobile] Right. - [Phil] Real easy. But I like that it keeps track every time. So when I go to my doctor and he says how's your blood pressure doing? I don't have to guess. - I feel like I want to make it clear that even though that's a Withings product and so is this. - Yes. - We're not sponsored by Withings. - No, no, no, no. - They just happened to tie together. - This is actually the first one I used. Cause I was too heavy. I was fat as Hell. I needed to lose some weight, and I needed a better way to track it, right? I mean, yes, I can get a normal, analog scale for like 20 bucks and write it down. I never did that. Go figure, right? This is super simple. All you do is walk up on it, it weighs you, it syncs it back up through their app, into the cloud. Actually, you don't even have to have a phone attached, like your phone could be lost and gone. This hooks directly into my wifi. So I don't have to worry about what my weight is on any one day. I look at it over weeks and months and I can see that the trend is going down, down, down. Okay, up a little bit. Oop, keep going down. - How much are these things? - 100 dollars for each one. - For the blood pressure cuff and for the scale? - 100 dollars for the blood pressure, 100 dollars for the scale. - What's this thing? - This is your, your favorite one. - This is my thing. Yeah. I'm super jazzed about this. This is the GoPro Hero 5. Meaning it's the fifth in it's series, and I've used just about every GoPro since the original one. And the most exciting thing about this is that it has a view finder built right in. - [Phil] I've got a four. Makes a total difference being able to actually frame your shot. - [Mr. Mobile] So, here's the thing. Here's what GoPro used to do. They'd build you a camera, and they'd sell you a viewfinder add-on that would stick on the back, and yeah, it would work, but it'd make the camera thick and bulky and annoying. They'd sell you a waterproof container, case, that would make the camera waterproof, but without it the camera wasn't waterproof at all. So the Hero 5 puts all that together. - Totally built in. And you can actually kind of take it apart, too. Some of the waterproofing you can take off if you decide you don't want it on there. This little thing in front of the lens can come off if it gets smudged or dirty or whatever while you're shooting. The flip side is some things are a little tougher. The SD card is a little more of a pain to get out. You have to actually open up the battery door to take it out, which means it can't be in a case if you just want to get the card out, so little things like that, but not the end of the world. - USBC. - [Mr. Mobile] Yeah, USBC connection. I like that a lot. I like that there's a display in the front as well, so that you can see that it's rolling. - [Phil] Yep. - [Mr. Mobile] You can do that GoPro face, where you're like is it on? Right up your nose. - [Phil] I do kind of want an actual display in the front though, so when you're shooting yourself with it, you can see that. - You can frame yourself up? Yeah, I agree. I mean one step at a time. I'm just glad to have it integrated on the back. And also, it is a touch screen as well. So you can choose your frame rate, you can choose your resolution. - [Phil] A ton of options, and that's good, cause it's still not inexpensive. It's an investment. - [Mr. Mobile] Yeah, yeah, it's pricey. Well, hold on, we're gonna hit the price in a second. But we took this up to the top of the lighthouse. - [Phil] Yep. - We took this to the aviation museum, here in Pensacola, which has the power to instantly turn me into a seven and a half year old. Can we go to the gift shop? - Have you been good? - Yes. I barely broke one airplane. - This is the literal definition of modern dad. Nerding out, while treating an adult like a child. - Yes. And I learned something really important, in between the car, the lighthouse, the Aviation Museum. I learned a couple things. One, it's really a lot of fun to have a camera that you don't need to put in it's case to not be worried about whether the rain is gonna kill it. - [Phil] Right. - [Mr. Mobile] Two, I learned that this thing is way the Hell better outdoors than indoors. - [Phil] Yes. - [Mr. Mobile] Oh man. - [Phil] Low light, it struggles a little more. - I would think that, with a casing this big and heavy, I would like some form of optical stabilization, and I don't think it's built in. - Sure. - [Mr. Mobile] If this is gonna work you need to be interested in the exhibits. - I am. I like boats. - How much is gonna cost me to buy this thing, cause I am going to buy this thing. - Retail, 400 dollars, still up there. What? Yes, it's a lot of money. You can get it on sale, you know, 50 dollars off here and there. - [Mr. Mobile] I'm gonna still call it worth it, based on the outdoor footage we got. I think on the next generation I would like to see some better indoor performance also. - [Phil] Well, and because of the change to the USBC, previous accessories that plugged in through the mini USB won't work. - [Mr. Mobile] Gotta buy a whole new round. - [Phil] Yeah. - [Mr. Mobile] USBC, solving the problems of today. - While creating the problems of tomorrow. - That's exactly it. - Yeah. - The very last thing. - Very last thing. - Is not on my wrist right now because our producer, Greg, is shooting at them. By the way, Greg did all of the product photography, pretty much, on all of this stuff, and it looks amazing. It's the Casio WSD-F20. The dopest brand name there ever was. - [Phil] The WTF what? - [Mr. Mobile] You can I saw this thing at the same time. - [Phil] Yes. It's a yes. - [Mr. Mobile] And I spent a good long time ogling it. How was your feeling on this world's largest smart watch? - [Phil] It's a huge friggin smart watch. - [Mr. Mobile] It's a big hawkin thing. - [Phil] It's ginormous. - [Mr. Mobile] And it's amazing. - [Phil] Yeah. - [Mr. Mobile] It doesn't do a lot to justify that big size. - [Phil] No. - [Mr. Mobile] If I'm not mistaken, it doesn't have LTE. - [Phil] Correct. - It does not have a heart rate sensor, that even this tiny little Withings HS Steel HR does. - I still go back to it's this giant, rugged smart watch, that you're going to take into the rugged outdoors, where you're doing rugged manly, outdoorsman stuff. And then at some point, you're gonna have to stop to charge it. - [Mr. Mobile] Uh, true enough. And I don't know, I haven't had for long enough yet. It does seem to last a bit longer than the first gen one does. Then again, with a watch this big, I would hope for a week long battery life, cause it's such a monster. It does have a built in barometer, it does have built in GPS, it does have a lot of stuff that is going to probably benefit you if you go camping. - I'm just saying, when I'm out there camping, the last thing I want to deal with is charging a smart watch. - No, the last thing you want to do is squint at your watch face to see what time it is. This dual display technology lets you see an LCD when you need to, it's full color and it's swipe. It's just like always. But then, when you're not using it, that layer deactivates, the top layer comes on, and you've just got this traditional LCD panel. - Okay, that's 500 dollars? - 500 dollars. - That's a lot for a watch, man. - It is. - Well, I mean, it's not a lot for a watch, but you know what I mean. - It's a lot for a smart watch. - Yeah. Review coming soon. - Yay. - Where can people find you if they want to see more of your dope studio? - YouTube dot com slash modern dad. - It's not gonna be there, but you get it. - It should be, we can put it there. I just learned to put it there. You see, it goes this way. - Click down in the description if you want to buy any of the items seen in this video. And follow modern dad, MDRNDAD, on socials. - In some of the places, yeah. - [Mr. Mobile] That's the ticket. - Should we do this again sometime? - Let us know if we should do this again sometime. Drop a comment down below, and until next time. - Stay mobile. - And stay off my lawn.",

    "transcript": "- Hello and welcome to, \"This Is.\" GameStop has just fired their CFO and hopefully for a good reason because they still sell some really dumb products. - GameStop is a company that over the last 10 years, its had so many different focuses. They take cell phone trade-ins, they sell you gaming PC stuff. - And now they're just trying to cater to you diamond hands. Are you still holding? Let us know in the comments. Depending on how we upload videos, this might be a momentous occasion because this is the last video that we're recording in this setup. It's all gone. - I'm gonna say Megaraptor can just hang out here. (beep) - But the first product they still sell which is really dumb is, the PS4 Chat Pad. - What? Wait, who actually needs this? Like, I guess to type passwords in. But like, who actually does text chat on PS4 or PS5 or anything? - There's some used items that I will get from GameStop, but this one here I will not get used. - Oh, this is only pre-owned. - Because this is used! - Oh! No wonder it says,... \"Style may vary.\" - This is gonna be covered, in someone's greasy Cheeto-dust hands because they didn't watch a, \"This Is,\" episode about the best Instagram ads where they got the finger chop sticks. - Oh, so this is $20. (cash register dings) - That is- - Dollars? - [Kinsey] $20. - Is that US dollars? - [Kinsey] Yes. - All right. - Next up we have... - Oh, hell no. I've tried these, the Bose Frames Tempo Audio Sunglasses. Okay. So have you ever worn your sunglasses and thought that you're super cool, but you're too cool to put in your headphones because... (Austin scoffs) Lame-os put headphones in their ears. So instead, your sunglasses have speakers that beam form or bone conduct or whatever nonsense that they use. - Those are two very different technologies, for the record. - But it's non... Nothing is in your ear, but it's sending audio waves through the air, into your ear holes. - Is this considered aural bliss? If it... - No, it's aural disappointment. - Oral bliss is mouth. - A-U-R-A-L. - Aural, A-U-R-A-L. - Right? - is ears. - No, I'm saying aural. - But you don't say it right. You're saying it right, now because I'm yelling at you. - Oral. - This has been a running joke for three years. - But I say it wrong sometimes and it bothers me. - No, you say it wrong all the time. - No, no, no, no. I always say it right. - And then I yell, \"Aural!\" And then everyone in the comments go, \"Aural! Oh yeah, he's...\" Look, these things suck. And they look stupid. - You've tried them, right? - I have tried them. If you wear these out, guess what? You're a nerd. - Oh, so these are $200. (cash register dings) - GameStop sells these. It's super weird, 'cause it's not a gaming product. - Which brings us to our next product which is one of the most tech of all time. - The Samsung Galaxy Note 9. - Here's where I'm like, this is why it's on the list. They're all carrier locked. - Which is ridiculous. I always thought that this phone looked a little bit awkward, especially with the fingerprint sensor, such a weird spot below the camera. - Yeah, unless you had like giant, like... - Unless you're Marques. However, this is back from a time where GameStop... and I know that they still do this somewhat, but they were doing a major push to be your cell phone store. You could trade in your Samsung Galaxy Note 9, and get yourself $11 of store credit to buy DLC or some V-Bucks or something. - Oh, man. - So a fun fact about this is that you can also get the Galaxy Note 10 for the exact same price. - Okay. Wait, wait, wait. Let's play Price is Right rules. Who can get closest to the price of what... - $259. (cash register dings) - No. $330. (cash register dings) - It is $323. And then you can get the Note 10, for $329. - This is stupid. Don't buy a Note 9 then. - Well... - Its carrier locked! - Oh my God. Yeah, that's so stupid! - That to me, that's the most egregious part of this. If you're buying a phone that's from 2018, unlock it. What's the point? I don't know. Moving on. We have... - [Austin] Whoa baba badabaha baddabah. - [Matt] Do we have to blur that? The Bellabeat Leaf Chakra Fitness Tracker. This vagina pendant is optimized for women's health. - Wait, wait wait. It does not have a screen or buttons but it is enhanced with a choice of rose quartz, \"love,\" or onyx, \"power,\" healing crystals. - So it is a fitness tracker. So am I correct in assuming that this will Bluetooth to your phone and track like, I don't know, your steps or something? What does it actually do? Other question, what kind of fitness tracker can be accurate if it's on your necklace bouncing around every time you take a step? - [Kinsey] \"It takes women's wellbeing to the next level by combining technology with the natural powers of crystals. Monitor your activity, sleep, stress sensitivity, hydration, and mindfulness minutes.\" - I literally don't understand any part of this. First of all, the fact that this is a GameStop product. Second of all, what? Third of all, what? Fourth of all, what? - This is snake oil because... - $89 dollars worth of snake oil. - Moving on to a much less sus product. - What? This is not in the... This is not a GameStop item. You cannot buy this from GameStop. You are lying to me right now. - This micro-USB-powered... (Austin laughing) - You can yell at your voice-command lock from GameStop. - The pre-programmed code for this is 8008. - Can you stop Matt? I don't personally love the idea of smart-connected locks. Generally speaking, I don't trust my home security to random turbo lock companies from GameStop. But also, who buys this from GameStop? What? - The Skeltr Smart Communication RGB Keyboard. - Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh. I have this. This showed up in our P.O. box, I don't know, a couple years ago, 'cause it's still got micro-USB. It's the stupid Roccat thing where it's got a little thing where you can drop your smartphone in. - Kinsey, how much does it cost? - $160. (cash register dings) - You could get a 1996 Ford Focus for that money. (Austin laughing) - I'd rather. - I'd rather the Ford Focus. All right, what's the next product here? We got Farming Simulator'22, Collector's Edition. - Oh, no. So this is the Collector's Edition for PC, which comes with a disc. I cannot think of any modern game that still comes on a disc for PC. Like, almost nothing that's actually like a proper new game. Bro. - [Austin] Game stonks! - [Matt] Game stocks! I wanna apologize to all the diamond hands out there. You apes are holding strong. - Are they still? - Yeah. - Aren't we over this yet? - No! - Oh, okay. - I can't say this with a straight face, like... - No, no, no. tell the people what they need to hear. That they're doing the GameStop's good work. And that it's pumping the value of a marginally successful game company that has ripped people off for decades is a good idea. I very sincerely want to thank everyone, who has purchased GameStop stock to keep this company in business, because boy oh boy, have I made a lot of click bait videos buying dumb things from GameStop and making fun of them. It's been a true delight. So please keep GameStop in business so I can keep making dumb GameStop videos like this one. - [Matt] The Mad Catz. Oh, okay. - [Austin] I had one of these too, Matt. - So this Transformer gone wrong, is currently unavailable. That means like there's one... - Yep. - GameStop across all of the world that has one of these? It fell off a shelf behind some boxes somewhere. - So like, with an old like 1997... - Yeah, it got lost in the inventory. The Mad Catz Rat, somehow makes this dumb hand keyboard-mouse thing look practical. - The Mad Catz... So the thing is, if you never played with Mad Catz, obviously they made like, all those like weird third party little brother controllers. But also, Mad Catz was a early, fairly big gaming company when it came to like the PC space too. Like, I remember when we were doing videos way back in the day, Mad Catz, Rat Mouses were actually like, people used 'em. I had one, a lot of people had 'em. They weren't amazing, but they were like, super customizable. - And this is Mad Catz in general. - Yeah - They had features, but aesthetically, they were so hideous and ugly. Like, no one even wanted to have these on their desk. - How much is the most expensive mouse? - So $200 dollars. (cash register dings) And the wireless one is $250. (cash register dings) - I didn't know that mouse got that expensive. - [Kinsey] Yeah. (Austin groans) - [Austin] The PhoneSoap. - [Matt] This is a PhoneSoap! No, not the PhoneSoap. The HomeSoap. 27 times the sanitizing space of the original PhoneSoap. - You could put a laptop in it. What? - Yeah. I would say it was listed at $499, and now it is $399. (cash register dings) - No, no, no. $299 and $199. (cash register dings) - When I first started making this video, it was listed at $170 dollars, and now it is $85 dollars. And I feel like it sensed my disdain and was like, \"Oh, I'll cut down some half a hundred bucks just for you.\" - [Matt] Enamel pins and Funko Pops. - [Austin] Wait, what? - Here's the thing, though. Like, I feel like this is just something that you can get on Etsy for even cheaper. - Well, the Pops kinda make sense, 'cause like, yeah, it's a 3D kind of thing. But why would you do an enamel pen of a weird looking thing? Which is a... It's like, you're like, one level too deep? - Yeah. - I wonder if you cut these open, if they have brains. (ominous music) - Am I reading this right? These are like 10 to 15 bucks for one pen? - Yes. - Wooh. - But well, I mean, the good deal here is we got $9 for a five-pack of Office characters. - I don't know. I think it's an assortment. I don't know if you get all five of 'em. - You're an assortment. Moving on. The Jensen Cassette Player. This guy here that they still sell today has a built in speaker. It includes a headphone jack and two AA batteries. - But not included. - Not included. - When did you switch from cassettes to CDs? That's my real question. - I think it was like 2000 exactly? - Yeah. My first CD was a Burger King free CD, which I gleefully put into... It came in like a happy meal, and I gleefully put it... - Uh, they didn't have happy meals at Burger King. - Sorry. Burger meals, whatever. I put it in my PS1, the only device in the entire house that could play CDs, and I listened to it on my CRT and it was like... I actually think it was like, Backstreet Boys or something. It was like, one of the like three single CDs. The cassette player looks great. How much is this cassette player? And if it's more than $30... - $19.99 - $16 dollars. (cash register dings) - Some of you have never had to rewind a cassette player with the eraser end of a pencil, and it shows. Like this idiot right here. - I'm making some really good noises and you know that they're pretty good. I cannot believe that I've gotten so old so fast. Time has moved by at such an absolutely, ridiculously fast pace. I feel like the things that we're saying right now sound like we are from 1910. But this was not that long ago! - The only reason we get any Zoomer audience is because of Robo Raptor. (Austin laughing) - The Disney Orange Android Tablet. - Do you wanna have an iPad baby, but don't have iPad money? Now you can get this tablet that runs Android 8.1 Go or 10 Go, depending on what part of the page you read. - It looks like one of those generic, basic, super, super, cheap Android tablets with that sort of, you know, that rubber foam case that your annoying 3-year-old cousin is gonna just toss on the ground. - However, reviewers have said, \"It broke.\" (Austin laughing) So... - $99 dollars. (cash register dings) - Thank you very much for watching, subscribe to the channel, - and make sure to ring-a-ling the ding-a-ling bell. - That's like 30 Amazon Fires for that price! - Can we all just say a quick moment of silence? The last video that is ever being shot in this space. Maybe it's not the last video that actually you're watching from this space, but until we see you on a brand new set that's probably very different and partially on fire, let's say... - Why would you jinx it like that? - Goodnight and adieu. We're after after the credits right now, right? When we first got this set ready, Aron spent a lot of time creating a graphic that has never, ever been used. We're gonna use it once and one time only. This is only because you made it to the very end of the video, friends. This is a rare treat. This, my friends, is a two-hour loop of the, \"This Is\" logo, as if it is a DVD. And I will tell you, that out of this two hours, we've timed it, it hits the corner once, after an hour and 43 minutes. Look at that though, is that beautiful? Look, look, it's getting close, but nope. Thank you very much for watching. We will be back very shortly, because ideally, the studio move goes super smoothly and that we're back up and running in a matter of moments. And Matt is growing gray hairs with every other word I speak, the more I talk about this. Thank you for watching, though. Sincerely, the studio's been great, but it's time for us to move on to bigger and better things. Let's play it out with the DVD outro and we'll catch you next time. As we go on We remember All the times we've had together I don't remember any other lyrics At this point we should have Faded out",

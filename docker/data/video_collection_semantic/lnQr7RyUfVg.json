    "transcript": "- It's gonna be a really good video. Video. - Hello and welcome to This Is Etsy, the place where people can go and sell their crafts. But do you know that they actually sell some pretty awesome tech? - Yeah, I know. I bought- - We're not gonna look at any of that tech today. - I bought a PC off of Etsy once. I did an entire video on it. It was very weird and very strange. But I have faith and confidence in Kenzie to find a wide variety... - That's your first mistake. - Of wonderful tech available on etsy.com. - [Matt] Vintage nineties, desktop computer. - [Both] Rare. - [Matt] Rare find. For a mere $262 and 50 cents. This, not a computer, but a monitor. - Wait, wait, wait. Time out. They say it's a vintage nineties desktop computer. - Yep. But it's just a monitor. Because people forget, what's all that junk in the trunk? If not, if not a full 40 90. The listing refers to it repeatedly as a computer, despite it not being, and it's in fairly good exterior shape. Except there's a giant crack right in the front. This probably does not work, and we won't ever know because the seller has not personally tested it. Moving on to the next item. Windows Movie Maker 2022 for Windows 64 bit. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. First of all, why is Windows Movie Maker being sold on Etsy of all places? They stopped making Windows Movie Maker uh, roughly 700 years ago. So it tells you to go to an old known scam site. - Yeah. - And it's like, \"Hey, download the malware version of Windows Movie Maker that Windows stop supporting in 2017. Is that cam set up? A blatant and obvious scam. - Listen, come here, come, come close to me. Come, come in, come in here. So if you want to be editing video just go do yourself a favor. This is actually, this is actual advice. All right. DaVinci Resolve is free. There is no malware in it, bud. - If it's too complicated, okay? I don't wanna make a cinema. I wanna make a movie with Windows Movie Maker. - A cinema? Are you a manly man? For 39.90, you can prove it. - Because we're early in the video, and we would like to be monetized, this is a personalized phone charging docking station with a device holster desk organizer for iPhone and Android because it's a piece of wood, and you just set your phone down on it? - No, it's gotta be compatible. If you try putting a Windows phone on this, will not work. - I will say, as someone who knows a thing or two about devices, you probably shouldn't leave your Nerf weapon. - What do you know about Nerf? Nerf or nothing. - [Austin] Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Zoom fidget metal skill toys. EDC gear haptic coin father boy-for-iend gift. - We're trying really hard not to say \"device.\" - We can't. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Censor that. Censor that. - We'll censor that. - We can't say that. We can't say that word. - You wanna pretend like you're John Wick, but don't have any of the coolness of Keanu Reeves for a mere 569, nice, dollars and 99 cents. - That's not nice. - That's more than an actual device. - No. Stop saying that. - Imagine giving this to your child and just be like, \"we're gonna, we're gonna start 'em early. Little Kyle's gonna be a cop.\" - Desktop computer and tablet. The photos of a sideways laptop. And I think that seven pixels on the top is a tablet? - Handmade. I wanna know... Yeah. Back like they used to do in the old country. - It is literally no information other than, they want $150 plus $37 shipping. Hey, Etsy sellers, maybe look up the definition of what a computer is because this is the second computer we've seen and neither of them are actual desktops. - I read this listing wrong. It's not a handmade computer. It's the tablet that's handmade. - [Austin] Oh, no, no, no. - [Matt] The Schumann resonance harmonizer and geopathic stress reduction helios 3. - I hate it. I hate it. If the next item is gonna be a crystal, I'm boycotting this episode of This Is, I'm gonna dislike it. I'm going to move over to a better channel. - The Helios 3 is totally unique because it is pulsing. NASA builds these human resonators into their space shuttles to safeguard the health of astronauts when they're beyond the influence of earth's vital frequency. Everyone asked me, \"hey Matt, how are you? How are you so calm, collected and stress free? - Your geopathic resonation is- - I stick one of these in between... - Nope. No, no, no, no. - My legs, at night. I tried 8 hertz. That was too much. 6? You barely feel it. But 7.83 is the, is the perfect. This is a mere $215. A steal. Every time I go to space, I make sure to bring my Helios 3. - [Austin] You know what? You could have used it last time we went in zero G, actually. - [Matt] I got sick everywhere. - [Austin] Do you want me to read this one? - [Matt] Aladlammu. - [Austin] Aladlammu. Your personal- - [Matt] You said the same thing I did. - No, I said it better. Okay, everyone, don't get upset with me. I'm gonna literally just read this verbatim. He is a highly erotic demon who protects you from ev- No, no, no. Stop it. Stop it, stop it. He is a highly erotic demon who protects you from everything. A wild, untamed, force that destroyed- Stop it. I gotta get this. - This is straight out of- - I'm gonna read it. - Twilight fan fic- - No, I'm gonna read it. I'm gonna read it. This process is 100% safe for you. Does not change negative karma nor are any other problems for you. Except you have to spend $1,700 on Aladlammu. So you get. You're paying someone on Etsy, almost $1,700 to perform a ritual to summon Aladlammu, your highly erotic demon. When we were doing Etsy, I figured it'd be like some goofy things. Like some- - Oh my God. What is... Guys, are you okay? - No. Oh, this is tech. It's the Bitmain Antminer Z15. - [Matt] More handmade tech, to be, yeah. - So if you take enough Bitcoins and you squish 'em together, you get a miner? - Yeah. The chassis's made out of Bitcoin. - Is this, is this Minecraft? I'm gonna tell a story, I should not tell, but I'm gonna tell it anyway. - [Matt] Oh, God. - So remember when my house burned down? Me is as a dude who had a bunch of PC parts, I, I had a bunch of light coin mining rigs set up. Not that that had anything to do with the fire. To be fair, they were unplugged at the time of the fire. So I was mining, but that was like 2013 before it was cool. Subscribe to This Is for other money launder- I mean, wonderful tips of advice and we'll move on to more stuff from Etsy that you buy, that's not the Antminer. That's gonna cost you $5,000 and lose you money every day. - We have ants in the office right now. We don't need an ant miner. - [Matt] Mr. Coffee asterisk PC. - Wait, hold on. Okay, I need to let this one percolate for a minute. - [Matt] Custom cooling loop now circulates some sensibly milk colored cooling fluid. - Clearly what someone did was they took an actual Mr. Coffee machine, gutted it, loaded up with like a mini ITX board, like a bunch of LEDs. Now this is the kind of thing where yes, it is $2,000 which is a lot for a system that's a few years old but like someone put some real time and effort into this. This is what I wanna see on Etsy. I wanna see this kind of stuff, right? I wanna see someone be creative, even if it's not for you. It might be for someone. It might not be your cup of tea after all. - [Matt] Now here's my type of speed. For a mere $800, this is the best gaming rig money could buy in 2005. - Wait, wait, hold, pause, pause, pause, pause, pause. Enhance, enhance. On the bottom right of that image. Is that a robo raptor? - I have a feeling that they've been trying to sell this thing since 2005. - No. See, this is the kind of stuff I wanna buy on Etsy. - All right. - This video's taken a dramatic turn. - So this Etsy seller discovered a time machine and said \"instead of going back and, and doing, you know whatever in a time machine, I'm just gonna go back in time and create listings from 2005.\" - You realize that, a time machine could be your closet? Cause you built something in 2005, put it in your closet and remembered it in 2023 and then pull out and sell it. - It's a time capsule. It is very different than a time machine. Okay? I don't wanna have to talk to you, about quantum entanglement. - [Austin] Now, wait. Now, wait. - [Matt] This thing actually- - [Austin] Nope. Nope. - When I buy a computer... - [Austin] Yeah. - I want the design to be what I would call empowering. - Empowering? - I want it to be eco-sustainable. - Sustainable. - And I want it to be made out of maple. Not redwood. Not oak. But maple. - Your computer, I think, should help you inspire creativity every time you look at it. And what could be more inspiring to your creativity than a bunch of fucking wood on a plate? From the front it looks like someone tried to make a PS4 out of wood. It is a low, low price of $2,499. Now you might ask yourself, what kind of amazing specs am I gonna get for my $2500? - A 40 90? - No, even better. The latest- - 40 90 TI? - No, no, no, no, no, no. This is powered by the latest 7th generation core i5 process. This art piece can handle any task you throw at it. As long as that task doesn't require a GPU or more than two or four quarters. Materials. Wood, maple, Intel i5, AsRock, Noctua. What more materials could you ask for? - I tend to build my homes- - Out of AsRock? - Out of Noctua. - All right, Linus. - [Both] Oh, hell yeah. - So this is the bling custom crystal embellished office desk phone. So you know, when you're at the office, you gotta pick up those calls. You don't wanna be boring. You don't wanna be lame. - No, you're into gaslight, and you gatekeep, and now it's time to girl boss. Be bold. Be you, be dazzling. - You know what? I'll give- That's a good slogan. That's a good slogan. The Crystalicious, registered trademark by the way, is completely covered in the highest quality Preciosa crystal. Why does it sound like a Harry Potter spell? - So not only will this look amazing, but those crystals are gonna keep you centered and grounded. As soon as, as soon as Mercury's in retrograde get ready to crush some calls. - Could they have picked a nicer phone, though? Looks like a $10 phone that you get like, from Office Depot, and you bedazzle it and you sell for $600. - Pretty sure RadioShack sold this phone. - Oh, Gina Alexander. Brand new photo print faux leather neoprene high quality handmade women handbag wedding memory. Just rolls off the tongue. - As everyone knows, every girl boss needs a fashionable bag to carry their stuff. And what better than LA designer brand that you can put wedding photos on? - You know how you go on- - [Coworker] No, no, no. You can't put them. They're already on there. - [Matt] There's some random person's photo on the bag? - [Coworker] Yes. - What? Wait. - Is like you're trying to manifest something in your future? You're like, \"I'm gonna walk around with a happy married couple and one day I could be happy too. One day I could be happy too. One day I could be happy too.\" - I know what this was because of. The bridezilla... - Okay. - Had this made as like a party favor, and this couple 100% got divorced and they're like \"now we have all these bags, we gotta get rid of 'em.\" - I didn't understand that Etsy was gonna be so unhinged today. I really did not think this. It's uh, not good, is what I would say. Can we see something else, please? - Wait, hold on, hold on. ROG Strix Touchstone keycap graphics card keycaps metal shift key mechanical keyboard. Is this just an ROG keycap? Is that what we're looking at here? - Yeah, for the shift button. So every time you want to capitalize a letter, you can cut your finger on that ROG. - ROG. ROG. ROG. ROG. - [Matt] It is $90. - [Austin] For the whole keyboard? That's not bad. - No. The one shift. Some keyboards have two shifts. You need two of these bad boys. Look at the beach ball spinning on his head. - I'm just, I'm just, I'm processing a $90 key cap. - Yeah. - I get that someone spent a lot of time, and I'm sure in the comments, you're gonna jump in and say \"Oh well I spend $70 per key cap. It's a bargain, cause it's handmade and artisanal.\" And there's nothing wrong with that. - Oh, I'm gonna say there's something wrong with that. I think you should- - No, you kno- - Seek help immediately. - I'm not gonna- No, no, no. I'm not gonna judge you. - I'm judging you. - I make questionable financial decisions all the time. So I'm not gonna be here on my high horse telling you that you shouldn't spend $90 on a key cap. It's a life choice my friend. It's a life choice to spend $90 on one ROG key cap that you just really, really love ROG about. Well, if you too would like to spend $90 and get nothing but a tiny key cap in return, I'm sorry you can't do that. But what you could do is subscribe to This Is for free. Not only is there a Ring-a-ling button that you could feel free to ding-aling and you'll have all the happiness and you'll get your own personal happy demon who will follow you around, defend you from clickbait and deliver, This Is videos directly to your subscription feed and the notifications on your tellular cellphone. And you'll have a great time. Thanks for watching. We'll see you next time when we get our minds blown by Etsy stuff that we definitely, definitely did not need to see.",

    "transcript": "- Remember, shower, drink some water and get some rest. Then you can get back to me when you're done hacking again, but awesome, you got the spirit. Moving to cyber, like cyber is thirsty as fuck, sorry. - You can say what you like, I like it, I'll rather have the raw person, go for it. - We need people there, and if you're doing sys admin work today and you wanna get into pen testing, do it, do it now, come to the dark side. It's fun, we have cookies, but there's never too late, it's never too late. (upbeat music) - Hey, everyone, it's David Bumble, back with a very special guest. This guest is based in Sweden, so really excited to have someone from Europe eventually. So Stok, you gotta tell me how to pronounce your name properly and introduce yourself. - Thank you, yeah, it's Stok, so, S-T-O and K, so Stok - Stok, sorry, my apologies. - Oh, you got it, that's perfect, that's the way to go. Most people say like Stok or Stok Fredrick or whatever, and I have no problem being stoked, so I guess that would- - There you go, I like that. So, tell us about yourself, 'cause, I mean, I know you were interviewed by my good friend Network Chuck, and you introduced yourself to his audience, but I would like to introduce you to my audience and sort of tell us a bit about your journey and what you're up to these days, because since that interview and other stuff I've seen online, things have changed. - Everything has changed, right? Isn't that how with the pandemic taking one step through the door, everything is turning to yeah, whatever. - A nightmare, yup. - Hi, my name is Fredrick Alexandersson, but I'm probably more known by my hacker handle, Stok. - [David] Yeah. - I'm from Gothenburg, Sweden, I have worked in IT in InfoSec for the last 25 years. I'm a hacker and creative and I currently work at stock and based company called Truesec where I'm working as the bridge between the experts and marketing and also working heavily on the purple side. - So, I'll say this, this interview is not sponsored by anyone, so whatever we say, yeah, it's just our opinion. So, tell us a bit about, like, if I remember right, you were in the blue team sort of infrastructure for 20 years or something? - Yeah, definitely. - You've been in this game for a long time, so you were doing that and then you did something else and now you're doing something new. So, can you explain a bit about your journey. - Absolutely, so I've started in the, I'll say mid 90s, my first IT gig was building computers at this computer mill where you kind of building computers for people that were buying home PCs, right? - [David] Yeah. - And after that, I went into networking and eventually, NT4 and all these good old stacks came out and I've been in Windows enterprises ever since, so I have easily 20 years as the troubleshooter of people's active directories because- - you mean people's dumbness because people, they do dumb things, don't they? But sorry, go on, I interrupted you. - They do, but then again, it's human, right? And not everybody probably knows always what they're doing and everybody's stressed or maybe you're working at this big company and you have 5,000 people working there and it's a bunch of servers. And back in the days, there were racks and racks and racks of service running and you weren't maintaining it like these virtual blobs today and somebody had to be the one that troubleshooted some certain things and some others, like, now it seems like the roles are very specialized, like, I'm working in network, I'm working in hardware and such. Back in the days, you kind of need to know it all. If something failed, you know, there's some problem with some kind of uplink in a stack of switches, you need to be the one to figure that out. So, you need to understand how that works and then you had Cisco and you have Dell and you have all these different suppliers of hardware and HP and you end up in a situation where you kind of need to understand networking, you need to kind of understand servers and hardware and functionality, changing rate discs, upgrading memory, and all that stuff. And also installing servers, updating drivers, inform where I was doing consultancy sys admin for a long, long time. And when people build these used data centers that they were hosting on-prem, cloud wasn't on the market, maybe some kind replication between data centers of course, but it was mostly like an on-prem solution. And people, sometimes things just stop working like DNS, for instance. - Yep. - Like, it's always DNS. - Always DNS, yeah. - So, I was the guy that you would call if things broke. So, this is bust and we don't know what to do and me and some other guys were come out as consultants and help people out. - [David] Yeah. - And I've been doing that for 45,000 hours paid work or so, so I've been in the game for a while. - Yeah, I was gonna say, you know, don't worry, I'm old as well, I remember NT4 and all the rest of it. So, tell me, like, I think, I'm not sure if I got the dates right, about two or three years ago, you decided to move into Bug Bounty, is that right? - Oh yeah, yeah. - So, explain a little bit about that and then I wanna get your sort of input about based on that experience, what would you recommend people do? I'll put a link below to a video that you did, which I think was the top five ways to get into Bug Bounty or tips, but I'd like to get like an updated version. So, give us a little bit of your story, how you got into that and sort of based on experience, what would you recommend someone do or don't do if they wanna get into that? - Absolutely, I mean, because it's interesting, in my background as somebody that has that kind of sys admin background, I realized that I understood where people shitted. I turned out to be an extremely good Pinterester because I know where misconfigurations happened. I understood where people were not being cautious about use names and passwords and configuration and such. So, when I first stumbled upon Bug Bounties, I saw it the first time in 2017 when I was at DEFCON, which is a hacker conference in Las Vegas. And I had a couple of friends of mine, they were participating in something called a live hacking event and I didn't know what that was, but I kind of social engineer myself to be a part of that event and to be in the bar, I mean, that was good enough for me, I was looking for free drinks, not doing kind of unpaid work or whatever, I was having a good time. So, I went there and I see all these people sitting there and they're like, oh yeah, no, we're hacking ex company now. I'm like, what? Yeah, yeah, we're hacking this company and if we find bugs and vulnerabilities in it, we'll report it and we'll get paid. I'm like, what the- - That's cool. that seems cool you mean there's gonna be any consequences because I come from a generation where if you poked at things on the internet, that would be like, it would be criminal, It would be problematic, you don't do that. And even though I have some hacking background when it comes to pen testing, primarily like networks and such, I never went against companies that I wasn't involved in. You're very concerned about your client, of course, but I never poked at random stuff on the internet, it wasn't my thing. I was on the blue team side, right? - [David] Yeah. - So, when I am there and I meet all these cool people and I could see that they making a lot of money, I'm like, how do you do that? And in ended up in months later, and almost like, yeah, eight or months later, I had the opportunity need to travel with Frans Rosen, which is a great guy, awesome hacker, had a possibility to travel with him with Hackerone, which is a bug bounty platform to India for one of the first live hacking events there at Nullcon. And I was primarily there as a photographer, I wanted to take photos and I wanted to engage and I wanna hang out, I didn't hack at all because I wanna document the whole experience of people getting together and hack because I was intrigued. - Yeah. - So, I was sitting there in a hotel room and one of the founders of Hackerone, Jobert, I was editing away and having a couple of drinks and I was like, Jobert, can't you show me some hacking? He's like, yeah, yeah, cool, check this out here. And he shows some site and and he's like, okay, this is using this blah, blah, blah version. Ah, maybe this is vulnerable to SQL injections and he started to show me a mindset on how to think. And I'm like I got that instantly, so that was the first time I saw the pen testing tool or the proxy name burp. And I've been more or less using that every day ever since, it's my daily driver. I use that even more than I do with other kind of equipment, it's my staple tool for hacking. And from there a couple of months later, I decided to get into it or I got bitten by the bug, like, the first second I'm like, wow, this is so cool. I need to dig into this and I asked him, where do I even start? Like the OS top 10, there's a lot of things to learn, what should I do because I never hacked web before. I was in infrastructure networking kind of guy, and he said, pick one bug class and go from there, learn as much as you can about it. When you find a bug, submit it, get paid, then move on to the next one. I didn't go for the top 10 list on OWASP, so I went and see what other ones they had and they had something called race conditions. And I knew race conditions because I worked with infrastructure, so it was something that I digged into and I realized how latency works and communication between the front end and the back end and how I could manipulate request data to get things to happen that was unexpected and I found a bug and I got paid for it. And I'm like, sweet, I just made 5k, awesome. How can I do this more? And then I got really involved and eventually ended up being a part of the live hacking circuit, traveled the world and one of the most valuable hacker built from Hackerone, most valuable team with two of my teams and I had really, really good time. - That's great, I mean, so let me let step back a bit. Firstly, what is a race condition just for people who don't know, and then can you explain what burp is as well? - Okay, we're can start with Burp. Burp is a proxy, so when you have your browser, right, or your phone or whatever you have that you're communicating with using an app or a web browser with a server on the internet, and just like you can sniff traffic using Wireshark or some kind of tool that looks at the RF channels or whatever. This is a tool that sits between the server and your browser. And since everything is mostly sent in HTTPS encrypted, you will need to install a certificate on your computer that says that, okay, I want this proxy to be the intermediate man in the middle for all the traffic that goes through that application. That means that you can manipulate the request going out and responses coming back. It's like the \"The Matrix\" the first time I saw it, it's like, you're starting up a browser and you think that you used hit in entering one website, but what's happening is that website's gonna reach out to, it's gonna be all these Google tracking and Javascripts and a lot of things that happening in the back end so you can see that there's a huge amount of request going out and you'll get amazed like, wow, how many traffic people are, like, things are being sent out. And if you're able, when you're using tools like proxies, there's Burp, there's a free tool and the community version is free. But if you want all the fancy stuff, you're gonna pay for it. But then you have something called the SAP proxy, which is a free version and there's some other contenders coming out right now. And it's just a tool, you can tap into the wire, you're listening to the traffic that goes through in the networking clear text, and you can manipulate the responses, that's what it is. And a race condition, I think the easiest way to explain it is that imagine for a second, that you and I, we're playing soccer or so, you're out in the field, I'm the goaly, so I'm standing in this big goal here and you decide to kick the ball against me. One ball comes my way, I can see that you're kicking away and I can see the ball come in and I capture it, like, okay, sequence done. I kick it back to you and you repeat it over again, that's one way you sending traffic. If there's two balls in front of you, you kick one, I'll see that one, caught the other one and I'm still in sync with you, I understand what goes on here. But if you instead would take, I don't know, 50 to a thousand balls and kick them at exactly the same time against me, I'm not gonna be able to pick and choose. - Yeah. - So, maybe I'll capture three and four requests coming in, but there's a big chance that two balls come in at the same time, that's a race condition or if let's say you had a vending machine, like these classic vending machines that you put money in, you push a button and the door would open and you can take your food out. - Yeah. - Supposed you only press that once and if you press it, you're gonna open that particular door and let you in. But if you are at the same time, you're putting your coin in and at exactly the same time, three, two, one and maybe have four friends, too, as well, that just pushes those button at the same time, there's a big chance that two or maybe three of those will execute at the same time, so the door doesn't understand that one has already been open, so it's gonna open up two for you. That's also a race condition. - That's interesting, and we're not advocating that all of you go out there and try this now, but that's a great example- - Hack all the things tho. - Hack all the things. - That we can scope. - Yeah we can scope, so explain just for everyone who's watching. What is Bug Bounty, and again, based on your experience, what are your tips for anyone who's interested in doing this? - Bug Bounty is a way for security researchers, ethical hackers, noobs, and experts, whoever that would like to test the vulnerability surface or the tech surface of x said company. If they find the vulnerability there, there's a big chance that they wanna communicate with someone and say, I found this vulnerability, I want you to take care of it. Usually, you needed to send an email to security at something or abuse at something and say, I found this security vulnerability here in your application, I want you to fix it. But now we have these organizations like platforms, there's a bunch of them. There's Hackerone, there's Integriti, there's Bugcrowd, there's Synack and a bunch of more. But what they do is that they will be the intermediate person. So, I found a bug in the system. Let's say, I found a bug in some of your applications maybe, and maybe you have a program were Hackerone, so instead of you getting flooded with all this information that's being sent in, you'll let somebody else take care of it and they will validate if the bug is valid or not. And if it is, they'll make sure that the payment goes out and the payment goes out and the payment can be anything from $500 to $50,000 depending on how it is. Maybe 50, $50 may be the lowest end and sometimes times you don't get paid at all depending on what kind of definition that kind of program has. But Bug Bounty is a way for you to identify security vulnerabilities, report them in a safe way and get paid doing so. - So, it's a legal way, 'cause you mentioned that word and I wanna emphasize that word in scope. It's a legal way within, and can you explain what that means in scope? How's it legal because the company's paying someone to try and find these bugs for them, is that right? - But maybe that company doesn't want you to poke at their whole infrastructure. Let say that you have a domain, in my case, let's say I have stokefred.com, that's my domain. And I have a couple of sub domains there, maybe I have one that's just particularly just made for my dog, so is be the name of my dog dot my domain.com. And there I have all the pictures of my dog, it's all cool. But then I have this app that I want to use for people to communicate with me and maybe that's on app on something. I don't want people to find vulnerability inside my dog portfolio because I don't want you to poke at it, then I'll define that that's gonna be outta scope, 'cause I don't want you to poke at that. If you poke at it, we're not gonna accept that you found any vulnerabilities there. Even if they are, we might just fix 'em, but you're not supposed to poke in that. - Yeah. - That is what defines the scope. Say we want you to look at is this, this is what programs do and they'll be something that has defined as a star scope, which is anything, any sub domain of said domain, in this case like, okay, maybe I have one that's one dogs.stokfredrik.com, cats.stokfredrik.com, app.stokefredrik.com, and then I have heyitsmywife.stokfredrik.com. And if all these are in scope, that that means that you are allowed to poke at them and help me find vulnerabilities in there. - Okay, so basically if I'm interested in doing this, I could go onto Hackerone as an example, and I could sign up and then are they companies like Uber and other companies listed there and then what sort of the process do I just see that this is an open thing that I can check out, like, this is the scope, try and hack Uber and then try and go for it, is that right? - Yeah and Uber is a good thing to say, because Uber has a star scope. Anything that's involved or affiliated with Uber is gonna be in scope. They're interested because they are secure to mature, but another company maybe aren't at Uber's level yet, so to get there, they say, okay, these are the things that we want you to look at. we will have no legal repercussion and we'll make sure that you are safe and we're gonna take care of you as long as you are staying inside scope. If you go outside scope, maybe we're not gonna be as gentle. It's not something that they're saying, but that's why I'm saying staying inside scope, because it's very easy to, like I said, you visiting one website and then it just spiders away, like there's a lot of Javascripts and traffic to, maybe some web servers elsewhere and whatever, still inside the same domain, but maybe that's not in scope. So, it's very important to understand, like, what are you allowed to hack at? Some programs maybe just are only interested for you to hack on their iOS application and not to hack on their website, because their website is hosted on some WordPress thingy and they don't wanna have excessive amount of traffic going in there, so that's out scope, don't poke at it. - So, I've heard some people talk in the industry and I wanna make this clear, is Bug Bounty a full-time job, or is it only a part-time job? And what would you recommend? Would someone like, should they resign their job and try and do this, or should they try and do it on the side? So, I mean, those are two separate questions, but like, is it a full-time thing or is it a part-time thing and what would you recommend if I'm interested, what would you recommend I do. - First off, I won't have to ask you, what are you interested in? How do you wanna spend your life? What things are important for you? because this is the answer that's extremely individual. - Yeah. - Some people say that's the best choice I ever made. I wanna be able to work the hours that I want to work, I don't want to have a boss, I wanna be able to take vacation for months at a time and they just crunch it a couple of months of the year. I wanna be able to travel internationally, I wanna be able to do the things that make me happy and if you live in, like I live in Sweden, living cost here is quite expensive and if you live in the UK, or you live in the US, maybe going full time isn't for you. But if you live in India, Pakistan, or some other company where $500 makes a huge impact on your lifestyle, why not? I mean, it's a global market right now. Everybody's, the choice is yours. Me personally, I've been doing Bounties full time, but then resigned going back into consultancy work or working for this other company now because I feel comfortable with repetitive paycheck. - [David] Yeah. - Because I made a lot of money in batches, but it's really hard for me to being that successful over time because I'm gonna have periods where I dip, where I don't find anything, maybe I'm not feeling too good, maybe I'm not into doing heavy research or maybe I'm just not interested. Working at a company that gives me a dynamic in that lifestyle and having that as a hobby is something that I started out having. For me personally, I started doing Bounties, when I got into this, I realized this is gonna take time and I'm not gonna be able to do this at six o'clock when I'm done with work or maybe I get home from work at six o'clock, right? I'm gonna cook dinner for my wife, I'm gonna take care of the dog, I'm gonna do all the chores and all the things. Then at 9:30, I'm gonna start to do some hacking. Usually at that time, my brain is fried, but it's not the most creative brain I have. - [David] Yeah. - And doing Bounties is something that you need to think outside the box, because these targets are heavily tested. These are being run over and over again by pen testing firms, red teams and a lot of other hackers are poking at them. So, of course you need to be on your edge, so I realized that quite fast and my way of solving that was saying, okay, I'm gonna ask my boss politely and say, if I take a pay cut, can I have Thursdays off? He said, okay, cool, you can do that. So, I started hacking every Thursday and doing Bounties. I got up at the same time, I got dressed, I pulled my coffee, I did my things, and then I hacked on these target for eight hours, I was done with that, I went with my other business and within a few months, I made more money doing that than I did on my full-time salary, which made it kind of sweet for me to have both. And then I eventually just moved over into doing Bounties full-time and here I am now back in the loop again, because it wasn't sustainable and maintainable for me to do that all the time. One day a week was perfect. - So, I mean, I think that's really important that you said that because when I sort of researched your story, you were a full-time person in another job, then you decided to take a pay cut at work or negotiate with your boss to take a day off a week and then you tested this on the side to see if it was actually what you wanted to do rather than, I'm very much against like big bang, just resign your job, go full time to study or to try something new. If you can do it part-time, it makes a lot more sense to do that and it's a lot less risky. And then you made more money doing that on the side than your full-time job, is that right? But you were doing that, I can't remember now, was it for a year or two years that you were full-time and then you decided to go back to a job, is that right? - Yeah, I was in the beginning of the, I resigned my job, because I was a part of the Bug Bounty circuit, I was traveling the world and I did in two years, I did 13 live hacking events internationally. And I ended up in a situation where I realized that I was going to be away for about three months every year, and I couldn't get that much time off my work, so I needed to do something, I needed to make an active choice. So, do I quit here and continue doing this? Then sadly, COVID happened. - Yeah, exactly. - And bomb the world shut down, no live hacking events. I did Bounties for full-time for about a year, and then I realized that I missed working on a team. Working on a team together with people and working with something that makes an impact, like, I'm very much driven about purpose and I didn't feel that me as a solo hacker couldn't make the impact that I wanted on the world. So, I joined Truesec and felt that then I was contributing on a bigger picture. - So, what do you do now? I mean, how is it different to the Bug Bounty thing? what is Truesec about? And there's not an ad for them, it's just to try and see your journey. - Absolutely, it's a cybersecurity company and we have most different size, we have offensive teams, we have incident response teams and we have monitor and detect teams, of course, and my job there is to be a part of the bridge between all the experts that work in the organization and the marketing side. - Yeah. - Because I speak both languages. - Yeah. - And sometimes that's not always working out too good, so part of my job description is working with that and then it's just being a part of incident responses, being part of offensive red teams and all that stuff, because I I've been doing all this few years and instead of just doing one thing all the time, I'm a part of a little bit of all these different ones and I'm primarily looking forward to be a better purple teamer, because like just as well as I speak marketing and business and hacking, I also speak red and blue. And sometimes these two teams aren't fully compatible as well, you need a guidance forward, and that's where I come in play because I can speak with everyone. - I wanna step back a bit, if I'm 16 or 14, it doesn't matter, let's say I'm a teenager or I am- - Awesome. - Yeah, well we wish- - Welcome to cyber. - Well, I like that, so I was gonna ask you, can someone who's young do Bug Bounty? Would you recommend it? I mean, you've walked this road, like me, we've walked roads, you've done a lot of things in your career. Looking at what's the landscape today, would you recommend Bug Bounty for a young person? - Absolutely, I mean, think about it. If you had a possibility when you were 16 to poke at this million dollar company, these huge industries, maybe you're a Twitch gamer, you like all into Twitch, or you are playing Steam or whatever, so your favorite computer game. And if you're at the same time, having that hacker hat on, the hacker's mindset, let's say, if I did this, I wonder what happened. If you have that mindset on and you find vulnerability in these systems, you can report it and get paid for it, or sometimes you don't get paid, that's fine, too. But it's an experience for you to grow as a person and just evolve that hacker's muscle, because it's all about changing the mindset and asking, why does this work the way it does? And what happens if I do this, it's testing really. - I love it because when we were young and I don't wanna say we were really old, but when we were younger, if we had decided just to like, hack a company to like Uber in those days, I mean, that's like jail time and it's fantastic today that you can actually do that legally and get paid to do that, so in other words, you not recommending that someone has to go and do a whole bunch of other stuff, like do 20 years like you did of networking and servers and all that stuff before they try this, can they just go straight away and give it a go? - Yeah, why not? I mean, absolutely. I mean, the scene has changed so much of the few years. There's like, you're a great YouTuber, you create content that people look at and they learn shit. The things that you talk about, you can't learn in school. - Yeah, exactly. - And it's free on the internet. They can consume your content and level up their game and they can go ahead and poke at it. I do the kind of the same thing, I talk about Bug Bounties and tools and firmware and frameworks and stuff and people can just try and do that, too. Although it's not all shiny, all good, blah, blah, blah. - [David] Yeah. - Because you need to understand that most of these targets that you are gonna be up against that's public programs, these are battle hardened targets, they're locked down. it's not a hack the box lab, it's by design hardened and if you find stuff there, that would be real good for you or not at all, because somebody else has found it and they haven't been able to fix it, so it's gonna be what is defined as duplicate, which is the only, the first reporter gets paid. But that being said, having that access to your hand that maybe you're doing some Hack The Box, maybe you're doing some TryHackMe, or Port Figures, Web Labs or whatever, and all this free stuff that's out there. And then you can go at Uber and look, how does this work? Or you can look at Yahoo or whatever, there's so many different ways for you now to be practicing and that's what I did in the beginning, I didn't know how things worked, but I had Burp running as a proxy when I was surfing websites and I was looking, oh, what does 200 mean? Four or three, what's that? 500 internal server, weird. And you seeing all this traffic that was just flowing through. And then eventually, I figure out how things worked and I watched a lot of YouTube series and listened to a lot of books, I struggle with reading books. I'm more like a poking around the internet and Googling and then falling down rabbits hole kind of person and then practically just trying things out until I get too tired of it and that's it. You need to just have a creating mindset, learn something new and poke at it. And if you do you, and if you find a couple of bucks, imagine for a second that you're successful in this. And you can show that I have these disclosed reports, I have these write ups that I wrote on Medium, this is my journey, how I went from totally noob to whatever, you have that as your portfolio and you entered the doors of Uber and said hi, Uber, I'm currently, blah, blah, blah, placement on your platform. Would you be interested in taking me on? I got so many hacker friends that got amazing careers through bounties because they focused on the programs that I wanna work there, I wanna work there, I wanna learn as much as possible about their organization and I'm gonna hack 'em and they hack, hack, hacked away and they suddenly, you know, they're taking positions on that program then getting noticed, so they're getting invited to events, they're getting invited to certain stuff and then suddenly you got a job, right? - I love it, I mean, I interviewed Neil Bridges and him I and I have had a few interviews and one of the things he mentioned, and he's sort of like ways to, you know, that whole thing in life, how do you get experience without experience? Who's gonna give you a job with no experience, and you've kind of said something very similar, if you want to get a job at Uber or Google or whatever, and you feel like that's such a stretch, would you say this is, I mean, I think you've already said it. This is a great way to get experience without having to go through a gatekeeper, is that right? - Yeah, for sure, then you need to understand the networking aspect of this as well, because if you can show that you've been doing certain things and you're talking to the right people, you're a great communicator in your reports, you're nice, and people wanna be around you, what's gonna happen? They gonna say, we got this up-and-comer on this program that's really cool reports, he's not there yet, but he's very creative and always nice, and I got so many good vibes here because people talk, that's the thing, and they're like, okay, yeah, no, I'm gonna check him out, he's on my radar. And then it just propels into something else. If you've being an asshole, people really fast gonna know that you're an asshole. - Yeah, I'm glad you said that. Yeah, go on, sorry. - No, that's it, because for me, I'm all about the good vibes, that's how it is and I wanna communicate that in every situation that I'm in, if I can be the person that's likable, be the person that listens and care and can help others succeed without my ego being in the way and saying and that no, I'm just gonna hold back because this young buck is coming out here and I feel hurt a bit because I'm old and he seems way smarter than me. That would be like idiotic and the other way around, like, okay, you go, you go, you got all the energy, so you haven't slept for two nights? Awesome, congratulations on you. Remember, shower, drink some water and get some rest then you can get back to me when you're done hacking again, but awesome, you got the spirit. - Yeah, I love it, I think I saw you tweet something about, like, what did you say about a teenager? You're good, but a teenager is better, something like that? - It happens all the time. I mean, I was at the skate park the other day and I'm down with it, I skate good. And then this little shredder comes around, half pint high and helmet on and just does things I couldn't even imagine, I'm like, whoo, dang, I wanna do that. And there's no chance I can do that because if I do that, I'll break and die. And then you see this report and this young dude that's writing this great research and like, wow, if I had that skill at that age, boom, the things I could destroy. And that's gonna happen all the time, because that's the circle of life, I need to stay back and just show people the way, like, wow, you're doing good, I'm tired. - So let's do that. So, I mean, there's a few things I wanna push you on. Skills, I think you've mentioned in other sort of interviews that Linux is a basic skill. Are there any other skills that you would recommend someone get if they wanna get into Bug Bounty or just hacking, red teaming in general? - Yeah, for sure, absolutely. I mean, that's the thing too, because cyber, I wanna break into cyber, okay? It's vast. - Exactly. - It's huge. What are you passionate about? And if you wanna do Bounties, Bounties is primarily hacking vet, that's what you do, it's apps on le phone or it's hacking websites, that's primarily what you do. So, of course you need to understand basic network communications, you need to understand syn and acks and ports, and IP and all that stuff and DNS resolving, get your network basics down, understand how that works, communication, how a server communicates to client versus, and when you're done with that, study up on script languages, maybe you're dabbling a bound with Python a bit or bash, but you're primarily gonna need to have some kind of nix system that you run things on. Windows is all good and all, and now with when you have this terminal that you can run like Ubuntu on, then it's all good, but get a virtual machine or VPS, that's a virtual private server in the cloud somewhere where you do your hacking from because you wanna be able to scale up and automate, and you want this to be running while you're asleep, because automation is crucial in this game. Because if you wanna figure things out or map out things, that's gonna take a lot of time. Because if you send too much traffic at the same time, that service gonna say, oh, hold on, 429, 2 many requests coming in, stop it. And you're getting ACME banned and the rest of the people in your home is gonna get really sad cause they can work Netflix no more. So, you need to have another system that's disposable that you can just trash and spin up a new one on a new IP, whatever. So some kind of Unix knowledge or basic Linux knowledge, of course. And that's also where all the free open source tools are. The tools that you're gonna need to be a good offensive player, because this is all, we're talking offensive worker. there's no defense in this, this is all about hacking. And if hacking web your thing and doing Bounties, sure, that's the route you wanna do. If hacking hardware, IOT, wifi, that's another route. There's just different routes, you need to find a thing that's intriguing to you. - So, I mean, Bug Bounty, I think you mentioned Linux, you need some networking knowledge, you need to understand about web, is that right? So, I just wanna get terms. I think you mentioned nix as a term, so just explain what that is. Linux, web, networking, just for general terms and then I want to come back to how do we get that knowledge. - Absolutely, So yeah, some kind of Linux based system, doesn't really matter what it is, but something, and then you are gonna need some web skills, understanding how does servers communicate with browsers and clients? And then you're gonna need some and kind of insights into HTML, Javascripts uses, APIs. The whole idea around how websites actually works or apps work. If you've got those down, then you can start to doing different labs and learning things and just poking and stuff and have fun. - You mentioned Hack The Box and TryHackMe. Do you recommend that as a way to build up skills and learn experience or do you have like a, I think it's difficult sometimes to, I'm trying to give some people a path and that's not always easy to do, but are there any courses or like, if you were starting, let let's go back. So, if you were starting today, you're 16 years old. what would you do? What would you do, like, step one, step two, do you have sort of a guideline? - Okay, I would skip university. - Yeah, okay, you would skip that. If you wanna do red teaming, Bug Bounty, no university is that right? - All the things that you need to do, if you're passionate about that, history you can learn through the books if you needed to, but if you wanna really get into hacking, there's so many free stuff available on the internet, so you can go from zero to working somewhere in no time. And if you willing to give up your time and say, okay, I'm willing to work for free, I wanna intern at this place, I'm willing to do whatever, then it's gonna get way faster for you. But you need to show the hunger and that's the thing. People are looking for people with passion. Everyone is always hiring, everyone is always hiring if you show up and do the work. - I like that. - So, all you need to do is pitch your idea, I'm passionate about learning this thing, these are the things that I've done, this is where I'm going and I'm here right now, can you help me do the rest of it? Because most people say, I wanna get into Bu Bounty, how do I start? Like, Google it, that's the response, because if you just ask me how to solve a thing or, oh, so you made $15,000 on that book, show me the write up. No, do the work, that's the thing because nobody's gonna give you anything for free, it sounds weird, here we're talking about content for free, but what I'm saying is that. - No one's gonna do the work for you. I think that's- - Yes, exactly, that's it, I couldn't find the right English word. - Yeah, that's why, you have to put the work in, don't you? - Yeah, that's it, just show up, do the work and deliver results and people will see what you're doing, but also make sure that you communicate with people because you can do the best work ever and never have your camera on in meetings or not be present, or not going to conferences or not doing anything, people won't notice you. If you don't publicize your work, if you don't show up and communicate what you're doing, people won't notice you because we're living in an extremely social world and be willing to say, I'm ready to work for this. I wanna have that, how can I get there? Well, first, if you are interested in getting started in Bug Bounty, just Google how to get started in Bug Bounty, there's a plethora of sites, Git repos, YouTube videos, whatever, and they gonna give you a route, like a tiny, tiny way down the rabbit hole, because this is a really big rabbit hole. And on your way down there, you're gonna eventually find things that you're interested in, like, oh, wow, that seems shiny, I wanna go that route and then you go down that and you do the next one. - No, I understand that, I mean, like on your website, you did like a top five. You know what the problem is, when you start, it's like often in a lot of technologies, you're kind of lost and you just need someone to point you, like go there. Do you have any recommendations or any favorites? - Yes, Peter Yaworski wrote a book, wrote two books actually on his journey. What he did was to document, he's whole journey from a beginner to an end where he was covering all the about classes. He's working through reports and explaining them and certain stuff, if you sign up for Hackerone, you can get the e-book for free. I got mad respect for Peter and the things that he done, he's also on YouTube, so please shake out he's channel, he interviewed a lot of people. Then you got Nahamsek, he's also done a lot of work. There's so many smart people that he has interviewed for his recon show, there's a lot of information you can find there as well. The thing with books though, is that they get old real fast. - Yeah, exactly. Because we're living in a society where new attack surfaces come out all the time and even though, it goes in cycles too, like 90s back again, you'll see some of the old school bugs, they're resurfacing, coming up again. But if you have to understand that technology is going so fast right now that you need to stay up to date with, like, check out things on Twitter, Google stuff, look at trends, what's happening and see what kind of CVs are coming out, what kind of research are people doing, just over the last two years when the pandemic hit, boom, it was like an explosion in past, suvirtual, they were all back again. It's like, what happened? because people got time to spend on VPN services because a lot of people just install VPN systems all over. so people started to poke at those and so trends comes and go. And I know it sounds like very vague, but Google stuff, that's it, you need to understand how to find information and way down this rabbit hole would be, if you wanna do Bug Bounty and web app pen testing, the creators of Burp, PortSwigger have something called I think it's like Burp web pen testing academy or something. - Yeah. - Is by far the best labs out there, you can get started with that. If you wanna do something else, hack the box, I think has some kind of web-based stuff as well is always a good training. Trihacking definitely has it, they have this OWASP to 10 beginners guide, costs like 20 bucks a month or something to be a member, you can get access to all these labs and while you're doing those, try to take that knowledge and adapt that and put that on real world targets, because if you're just doing boxes, you're not gonna be able to do real world because real world looks different, they are not designed to be broken. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, Adam Langley's CTF challenges.co.uk, I think that's the one, he has some really cool labs here. Those are definitely bounty lookalike things. He's made a bunch of really cool CTFs for Hackerone and Hack The Box, no, TryHackMe. So, I would say do labs, poke around on that, but if you're really interested in this, pick one bug class, study as much as you can around that, learn as much as you can around it. Find that bug on the live target, move on to the next one. - I love it, so I mean, you chose race conditions, so, you find something that's of interest to you or based on sort of your experience and then try and hone your skills on that area, is that right? - Yeah, then I went over to XML and XXEs and I fell in love with that and now I'm like deep into XXE research and anything that's related to XML makes my heart go like, woo, I'm all good. So, I'm reading up the standards for SVG and see how can I can poke around things and just trying to figure things out, anything that's blind and outta band, that's my jam, so I love those. - So, I mean, you mentioned like networking and I see a lot of people seem to mention this. Okay, I'm young, 16, whatever, doesn't matter, oh, I'm just outta college. How do I network? Is it just follow people on Twitter or do you recommend LinkedIn? Do you have any of, from your experience, how do I get into this community? How do I get a good name? - First off, show up, inject yourself into conversations, but don't ask for anything, just provide things or be a nice person to be around because people tend to levitate towards people that seems to be nice. And if you say, okay, I'm super introvert, I don't like meeting people, I have no interest in talking to people at all. So, okay, that's tough, it's gonna be harder for you, but so maybe you should focus on getting some classes on communication, start to talk in front of people, because a very good way to understand something is to be able to teach it to others because you really need to understand how things works if you wanna be able to teach it, so you need to study up on that. And that means you're working on your communication skills and listening in and being very, like, if you're giving things away to people and they're like, wow, that person's really nice. I wanna engage with that person, magical things happen. So, when I say networking, do the pandemic, it's been extremely hard, but there's like Discourse, you can hang out in or slack channels or something, or Twitter or whatever and maybe you'll find somebody that you want to collaborate with, but if you're collaborating with people, you need to understand that if you're doing bounties with people and collaborating, this is a money game and there's trust involved and you need to build that trust to a level with somebody says, I'm okay, I'm willing to share my bounties with you. I'm willing to share my secret sauce with you and I would expect something in return, maybe not all, but I would say I would at least be a bit cautious on just giving away whatever secrets I have for something, because that's kind of your side hustle, that's your money making machine. So, in bounties is a little bit different than collaborating on, let's say hack the box, which is a CTF, so it is a fine balance, but creating trust and talking to people and being engaging and writing stuff or sharing things and just being curious, showing up now when conference are open up again, go to those. If there's a local OWASP meet up in your area, go to that one. if there's some kind of event happening around cyber, cool, do that. If it's not, create it. - I mean, it's a lot, like, during the pandemic and I mean, we've never met, but we've communicated online. There's a lot of social ways to connect. - For sure. - I always say people have different strengths, some people write well, I don't write that well, some people are better at video. There's so many options on social to share. I wanted to get to this point, what is the negatives? So, like Bug Bounty, from what you've seen? I think one of the things you said is that you were alone. Are there any negative things about Bug Bounty to be aware of? - Absolutely, I mean, there's shit loads of thing that's no negative about Bug Bounties. Because if you wanna play this game, you need to have persistence. This is not a sprint, it's not a get rich quick scheme if you're into that do crypto. if you're interested in this and doing it long term, I see it as a way to build a career, to build muscles because Bug Bounty is like pen testing, but you're running with weights, it's just harder, it's just more challenging. But if you reach your goal, it's gonna be rewarding and nice, and you are happy and the thing with Bounties is that you found a bug, I found the same bug, you reported it before me, I wrote a great report, you wrote broken here, point. if you were first, you're gonna get paid, I'm not. So, it's a balance game there as well, so there's always this risk that you're not gonna get paid, then there's the 90 day cycle. Some companies only pay out every 90 days. How do you stay sustained for 90 days without income? That's the thing too. So, it needs to be something that's over time repetitive and you gonna go into what I define as the ebb and the flow of bounties, Like, sometimes, like it's all good, sometimes it's all shit. So, you get through the motions like that's how it is. and you need to understand, you need to take breaks, too, because your brain is gonna get fried out when all this information you're trying to just crunch into your head and then you can stand back and relax a bit and what's gonna happen is that maybe a week goes by, maybe a month goes by, and then it happens. That itch, the thing that makes you browsing through Twitter and you're like, goddamn, that seems interesting. Maybe I should just, you open up the laptop and you're at it again and then boom, you're back in the loop, it's that cycle that you're gonna go through and that's normal, so just understand the air, bend the flow. And that bounties for me personally, is a great side hustle, it's a great way to strengthen your muscle, it's a gym where you've been doing the first, like the organized things in the labs, so you ready, you get your basic stuff, but if you really wanna step it up a bit, then you do bounties and you have fun with that. But you need to understand that even though I've said that anyone can do it, I realize that not anyone can do it. - Yeah. - And I'm humble with that understanding, I spoke outta my own experience and I'm a fast learner, I love puzzles, my mind thrives in that environment, others don't. So maybe that's not for you, but if you haven't tried it, you don't know. - Yeah, I love it, if you don't try it, you wouldn't know if it's for you or not. And I agree, everyone has skills and some of us are stronger in some areas and some of us are weak in some areas, but if you don't try this, how would you know? So you'd recommend, especially if you're younger and you're not sure where you're going and you wanna get experience, this is a great way to try and actually test, yeah? - Some of the smartest people I know under 20, mind blowing, great hunters. So insanely smart researchers. I would say so many people that I hang around me make me the dad easily. And I love that about hacking because hacking generally is nobody cares about your gender, nobody cares about how old are you, nobody cares about your color, the language you speak or where you live. It's all about what do you bring? - That's what I love about the way the world is these days. You and I are not based in Silicon valley, we are not based in the US, we based somewhere else. - No. - I love it that the world has changed so that you don't have to try and get through some silly gatekeeper. If you can bring it, like you said, if you put the work in, if you can bring it to the table, you can win. - And if you're good at Bounties, then you're gonna be great at other pen testing areas and maybe you think that pointing web is boring, then pen testing internal networks is your thing. Maybe not even that, maybe realize that I wanna make an impact by working at incident response, but since you know the tools that attackers use, you're gonna be extremely valuable in the situation because you can help track that first patient zero back because you understand how the movement works, you understand how the breach happened. - So, I wanna get philosophical for a while and just, we've done a bit of that, but I want to, you said it yourself, you're like a fatherly figure sometimes. What advice would you give to young people? Is there anything like, not just Bug Bounty but like, any advice that you would give them in a career in hacking or tech, what would you advise? - First, check your health, like mental health, seriously in this day and age, it's even more important, like, I got diagnosed with ADHD at age 44. - Wow. - I wish that happened way earlier. But it gave me some kind of calming experience and understand that my mind doesn't work like most other people do and I'm okay with that. - Yeah. - It was like a soothing feeling of understanding that it's all good and then understand that you are the product of your own mind, you are the product of the ideas that you wanna put into this world. If you wanna be a great pen tester, then start becoming that, but you need to just walk your way. If you think it, it's gonna happen, nobody's gonna give it to you, but if you set a goal and work towards it, I know it's all hip and shit and affirmations stuff, but if you really believe it and say that's gonna happen, there's like no power stopping you because you're gonna align your life towards that goal. And everything that you do is gonna be motivated and going in that direction. Nothing gonna stop you, but you need to understand what you want because things can't align for you if you don't know what you want. - Yeah, I mean, if you don't have a goal, what are you gonna aim for? - Exactly, and it doesn't need to be a huge goal. I never have this five-year plan that people talk about because my life is too hectic. - [David] Yeah. - And don't be worried if you don't know what you wanna do, there's something in your life that you're passionate about. And that could be anything from like, oh, I'm into computers now, or I'm into playing Minecraft now, I'm into something, whatever you're passionate about, let that be something in your life, but it doesn't need to be the only thing. I went through my life doing a lot of stuff, like I do hacking, I have a sustainable fashion store, I run a clothing brand, I'm a sustainable looming advocate, I traveled the world, I lived in Bali for months and on and on. I'm a yoga teacher, trainer, blah, blah, blah. I got all these different things that's been a passion in my life. And I let myself be indulged in that and follow that until I find something else that I'm passionate about and not afraid for change, because if you follow your heart, you're gonna be happy. In the end, I know it's very Gary Vaynerchuk to say, but happiness is the thing that you can buy it, and it kind of comes from inside. But we also know that our brains are wired for survival, which means that we're not meant to be happy, we're meant to survive, so sometimes this is gonna work against us. But as soon as we understand that, we can just aim towards what's gonna make me happy, what do I enjoy doing? Like, for instance, one thing that really gives me satisfaction is talking to people. - [David] Yeah. - And learning new things, those are the things that I'm extremely passionate about. - [David] Yeah. - Sometimes it's tech, sometimes it is how to make a great worm compost, doesn't really matter, I like learning new stuff. - But I mean, isn't that the hacker mindset, you're trying to understand things, try and break it or maybe do something, I mean, it's inside of you to try and discover how things work. - Yeah, hackers maker's mindset, definitely. - Some of the people that watch these videos are not 14 or 16 or 18 and we were talking a lot about young people. What about someone who's a bit older? Would you recommend, if I'm 30, I have a lot of people who send me messages, like, they were a ambulance driver or a nurse, or they were in retail, something like that and I think the pandemic has really changed people's views about what they're doing with their lives. Would you have any advice for them? - I got the question too, people say that, dude, I'm 35 or I'm 25, is it too old to get into hacking? - Exactly, yeah. - Seriously, it's never too late for anything as long as you are passionate about it. As long as you want it, it's never too late. - I like that. - So, of course like, if you want, but if you think that you're gonna do a five year re-schooling and then just eventually be this super person that's not gonna happen. There are ways to go through school, I just think that these two or three year schools that you go through, they give you such a narrow understanding of things that you have no depth, at least like you're poking all these kind of things. I would rather suggest that find something that you really, really, really like and nerd in to that. And then be like, I wouldn't say expert, but really good at that stuff and just add things on because then you have this niche that you're really good at and you can just go from there because in this day and age, let's imagine for a second that you were a COBOL programmer. Do you know how valuable you are? - Exactly, yeah, exactly. But if you think you're gonna do bounties and say, what is the easiest bug class? Maybe XXS is gonna be my thing, then you're like, oh, you and 600,000 other people doing the same thing. That's why I choose race conditions because that's a different kind of beast. You find something that you can out in and be really good at and then you are adding value because you're sticking out. And if you wanna do certifications, do that. If you wanna do all this other stuff, do that, too, because you don't know, who's gonna look at your application. Somebody maybe thinks that CEP is the best certification, oh CP or whatever. And somebody else would say like, I don't give a crap about that. - Yeah. - Let's take a review and see what these person is talking about. And if they gibberish on about things they don't know, I'd rather say like, okay, maybe you don't know that. Or just being honest, I don't know this, but I'm willing to learn. Do you know it? Can you explain it to me? - [David] Yeah. - And just be curious, because it's all about being curious. And the information is out there and everything for you to go from zero to nothing, like, you don't need to spend that much money to get really good at computers today, especially hacking, if you wanna do that, there's so much information. It's gonna be harder if you wanna do incident response or real advanced defense work, primarily because I think that's a area where you need to have a little bit more experience of older systems and such, because most systems aren't the latest Kubernetes build, super fancy old stuff, but let's say that you're, I would say if you're working in tech today and you're doing sys admin work moving to cyber, like cyber is thirsty as fuck, sorry. - You can say what you like, I like it, I'd rather have the raw person, go for it. - We need people there. And if you doing sys admin work today and you wanna get into pen testing, do it, do it now, it's awesome. Come to the dark side, it's fun, we have cookies. This is where you need to move. but if you wanna do defensive work, that's cool too, but there's never too late, it's never too late. - This is why I love tech, I mean, I've seen it many times. you and I have been in this game for a long time, who cares about analog modems, ISDN and all that old stuff? - Use robotics. - Yeah, who cares about that stuff? I mean, some of the people watching might even not know what we are talking about. What I love about this is if you starting today and you start on sort of new stuff, in two years time, five years time, you could be the expert in whatever that field is. - Yeah. - When you started, you looked at like the OWASP top 10, and then you decided to jump into one of those areas. Is that right? - Bold clashes, yeah. - And would you recommend someone do something like that or is it just- - Absolutely, why not? Do that, learn the top 10 most vulnerable web classes today. These are the things that people are struggling with and learn how that works or even better getting to Web3 and understand how does the Blockchain work, how does smart contracts works? How to defy or all that stuff. How does that work, because it's gonna be an extreme need for auditing in that area and understanding how that code is built. And what's also interesting is that we can talk about, oh, it's all Web3 and it's all decentralized and pretty awesome, then the have this portal over here, that's old school web style that's broken and then that's gonna be the one that people stole a lot of money. So, you kind of need both, but if you're interested and I would say, there's gonna be a high demand for people that at least understands how the smart contracts work and that world. So, if that's something you're interested in, go down that route, but understand that you need to understand the basics. And it's like basics first, then depth on whatever subject you like. - So, are you saying that if I started today, Web3, Blockchain, that kind of stuff is where you would focus or like you said, start with the basics, would you just go straight into that? - I mean, yeah, why not? I mean, it's an area that's extremely young or extremely, it is a couple of years old, but it's an area where people aren't heavily invested to that area. And if you can be you really good at auditing smart contracts and understanding how this works and find vulnerabilities in that, not only can you make a big buck, but you can be a very important asset for pen testing firms, for cybersecurity organizations that wanna niche into that, because people that are heavily invested into Web2 maybe wanna keep on doing their stuff that they're doing currently. And there's gonna be high demand for people in this new niche. And who knows? after that, it's gonna be Web4 or Web3.11, who knows? Something's gonna happen and that's why I love this space, because it's ever evolving and you need to stay up to date and just evolve with the times. - Stork, I really wanna thank you so much for sharing your experience and your knowledge. it's fantastic to get input from people in different spheres and different life stories. So, I really wanna thank you for sharing with us. - Oh, I'm happy that I have the possibility. I'm super passionate about cybersecurity, cybersecurity awareness, and see what comes next. So, to all the people that are out here and just loving the things that David do, stay curious, and I'll see you around. - I've put all the links below, social media links and other really important links, so make sure that you click on those, make sure that you subscribe and you know, all the very best.

    "transcript": "- We are doing the ultimate tech renovation for the one and only Kallmekris! - Hello! Welcome. - And not to be out done by Intel who sponsors these upgrades for our staff, ASUS ROG has sponsored this video where we will be doing everything. New TV, new monitors, new game streaming setup, wireless speakers, new furniture, RGB freaking lights all over the room! And we've only got like six hours. We are gonna need some help. (bones cracking) - We are gonna need some acoustic panels in here because... (claps and echoes) - It is loud. - We're gonna be spending the majority of the shoot in this room- - Yeah. - And this is atrocious. - Yeah. - Fortunately, we've got that covered. - Yes. - These are ProSoCoustic panels. They have a couple sets. We got the thinner ones. They have sound absorption in the front, and then on the MDF panel that this is mounted to, they actually have a dispersion ring routed into it. So it's a wave guide that helps disperse sound from a small point into a larger area. - All I know is that these cover these panels because they're taller. - That's terrific because as much as this is wonderful, by the way, they did a very nice, professional job of terminating all your networking here. - I hope so. - I don't wanna look at it. - No, no, it's ugly. And he broke it. (Kris laughs) - No, I didn't! It's fine. No, she actually looks... - Everything's fine! - Oh. - I dunno what that is, but it's getting covered so it doesn't matter. (loud bang as unit snaps into place) - Good god, I had expected this to be a lot more- - Done? - Yeah, a lot more show up and just put things on stuff. Well, that's fine. Like, yeah, I'm gonna wear a toque and a hoodie 'cause I'm not gonna be moving that much, geez. Lttstore.com, or wait no, you should do it. Why am I doing it? - I dunno. - Do you drill? She screws, but does she drill? - We'll see. - Yeah, excellent. - I am really good at falling, so this is good. - [Callanan] Don't push too hard as you go through. As soon as you feel it go, stop. (drill whirs) - It's hammer time. You're young enough, I'm not sure if you get the reference, but- - Yes I do, MC Hammer. I got it. - Just making sure. That's good! - Thank you. What is the round end for? - If I recall correctly, that's for like flattening out like metal things or something. That's not a hammer that I use a ton. - Oh, like forging. - Hey Callanan, is it for like leather working or like... - [Callanan] No, it's a peen. - A peen. - [Callanan] One side you hammer, the other side is used for stretching out metal. - Oh, okay, so like forging. - So I wasn't wrong! - Yeah, that's what you just said. (beep) - Well I'm gonna make you touch my peen now. (Kris laughs) - This is a really fun screwdriver. - Thanks! - Like it like turns back and you don't need to keep... you know what I mean? - Can you say something for me? - lttstore.com. - That's our screwdriver. - I'm getting one. - See? Logo. - Oh, look at that! I like this. We did this right. Oh, look at that. Beautiful. By my calculations it should be right there. (Kris laughs while stud finder beeps) - All right, perfect. So here's what we're going to do. - Which would make sense because that's how this is mounted. - [Linus] Basically, we're gonna put this bad boy right here and then we're never gonna see it, 'cause it's just gonna hold- - Yeah. - The panel right in front here. - It's a spacer. (drill whirring) - Beaut. - Perfect. We didn't put in drywall anchors. - We did not. - Wait, what the (beep)? - I'm just a constant disappointment. - That's okay, me too. Oh, look at us. - There you go. (drill whirring) - Good. Perfect. - Okay, cool. - This one I do wanna level. That's why I actually put it slightly above that. - Because we can't take for granted that whoever put this wonderful- - I don't even care if he's watching. - Door in here. - It's probably not level knowing him. (laughing) - It wasn't level. - No, I'm not surprised at all. - There's a lot of deficiencies in this. - It wasn't close! - [Linus] I have bad news. You want the bad news now? - Yeah. - Okay. They are not going to be even. - Yeah, they won't right? Yeah, that's okay. I'm weird. Stuff can be weird. - Okay, well in that case, do we lean into it? - Go, like, a step down. I think we should lean into it. If it's like just off, I think that'd be like a little weird. - So in that case, I want you to aim high. - Aim high and this one low. - And this one we aim low. - Love it. Hello? Is it locked? - Can I help you? Oops. - Righty tighty, lefty loosey. - This is basically a three Stooges- (both laughing) - It really is! - Sketch at this point. - I've assembled a table. I've assembled coffee tables, all this stuff. It's too much. I need to make more friends though 'cause I've just been doing it all myself. - Aww. - Sad. - Well, I actually have a strategy for that. - What's that? - You just hire people. - Oh, that's what you do! - Yeah. I don't have- - Whoa! - I have lots of friends. I just pay them. - [Kris] Oh, there we go. - [Linus] Okay. We good? - Yeah, right? - Looks amazing! - It looks so good! - Okay. (claps) TV. So 55-inch OLED, and why this? - Because it's a 55-inch TV and I don't know. - Okay, are you gonna game on it? - Yeah. - It's perfect for that. - Okay, perfect. - Okay, do you like good image quality? - Yes. - It's perfect for that. - Perfect. - Okay, then we're good. - Awesome. - It's a 55C1 from LG. This room has a lot of natural light in it which isn't always ideal for an OLED. - Blackout curtains. - Oh really? You're gonna go blackout? - I mean maybe, if you think that's a bad idea then no. - Yeah, I mean I saw the heavy eyeliner, but I didn't take you for like a goth chick necessarily. I want the curtains to be as black as my soul. - No, not like that, I mean like blackout- You know what I mean! God damn. - Too much fun. Okay. So yeah, that clearly goes there. - Right? Does this hook underneath here? Or does that hook on top of there? That would make more sense, no? - You know what Kris? Yes. (several people shouting \"ohhh\" around the room) - [Linus] Got 'em! (grunts) oh yeah. This is a tech workout. - [Kris] Supposed to be lightweight. - This is the extra bit for the Arc sound bar, right? Oh, that's so cool. They have a specific one for the Arc. This sound bar is awesome. It's the best sounding sound bar that I have yet encountered. - Pumped. - You know what I think people should do on their honeymoon? - Build stuff. - Build furniture. - I've said this before. - Do you know how many fewer divorces we'd have? - And go on a road trip. - And annulments would go like this. - Yes. But this is still- (loud snapping noise) That's loud. This is supposed to go on here though, no? Yeah? Like this? The TV's supposed to hook on to this? - Yeah, but the TV's here. - [Kris] What is this? I'm so confused. - [Linus] What am I even looking at? Callanan! - [Callanan] Yeah, right here. Essentially, step six: add TV mount. - Yeah. - Okay, so the TV mount, he no go on. How the hell do I raise this? - I don't know. - Wow, do you just have to like really give her? - I'm just gonna back up. - [Callanan] Oh, it was both. - [Linus] This is so stupid. - [Kris] Oh, so you need a friend to do this. - Bad news, Kris. - I know! - I want you to just supervise and make sure this doesn't do that. - Oh, okay. - BRB. - Because we didn't put the screws in on the bottom. The TV could fall and I could break my foot. - And it would ruin the shoot and ruin our friendship. Like that would be 100% friend lost. - He said we're friends, you heard it here first. Next time I need to move, I'm calling you. (both laughing) He's like, \"... and I'm gone.\" - I said friends, not BFFS, okay? Moving? That's a big step in our relationship, okay? - That's huge. - Something I couldn't help noticing, Kris, is that your genius contractor didn't put a conduit here. Did they know you were gonna put a TV here? - Yeah. - But they didn't suggest maybe a conduit down to like where your HDMI source is? - No, they just said, \"how about you figure it out?\" I love the water bottle. - Yeah. This is ours too. - It's great. How many liters is it? - Awkward thing, I only know in ounces. It's forty ounces. I should really... I'm a bad Canadian. - How un-Canadian of you. - Ooh, you got the white one. - Ooh, yeah. - I like it. - I like it too. It'll blend in with the wall. - That looks great. - Cool. - Ooh, watch your head. - Yep, yep. There we go. - Just a little friendly head bashing in. - It's fine. - So you wanna push it? Yeah, wow! - Yeah dog! - That's awesome! It looks so good. - That's awesome. We're gonna do two of these big ones flanking the TV. - Oh okay, cool. - So that means you gotta tell me... We're gonna do one of those test your relationship things where I hold up a heavy thing, you stand over there, hum and haw, have me move it millimeters at a time. - Ah yes, to see if it's where I want it? - Yeah. So are you ready? - Okay yeah, I'm ready. - Are you feeling up high? Are you feeling down low? Are you feeling too slow? Cause I'm feeling like you're too slow. - Always. - I'm too close. I actually cannot see how it looks here. - Here I'll switch. - I don't know. - It's hard! - Because it doesn't look bad high, but it doesn't look bad low. - So we have two extras of the small ones. So something we could do is we could go up high and then have a small one filling in that blank space down low. How do you feel about that? - Yeah, we can do that. - That's a vibe? - Yeah. - Okay, let's do it. I didn't give any thought to the stud-siness of what we're doing here. - One can be on the stud and one isn't? - Yeah, that's fine. I don't know. Let's do one here too. - You're just drilling holes in my wall now! - (beep) it, we'll do three. - Okay. Oh, it's the wrong spot. - No, no, it's all good. (laughing) - Can you imagine? - How are we gonna hit them though? - That's a great question. - I'm gonna try not to drill into your floor. - Oh, fantastic. - Big reveal. So I'm gonna line that up with that. I'm gonna go like this. (bangs hand) And there's where we're gonna do two more anchors. (Kris laughs) - I was not expecting that. I was expecting something so much more magical and you just punched my wall. You're like this. - That's the thing about good plans. They're what you should have done in the first place. - [Kris] That's okay. I really wanted extra holes on the wall anyway. - Look at it this way: you were gonna lose either way. You collab with a tech channel, the handyman stuff's gonna suck. You collab with a handyman channel, the tech stuff's gonna suck. - This is true. - What matters more? - Tech stuff matters more, all the way. - I think I'm gonna hit a stud here. (shocked noises) That's not a stud. What the hell? How's that even possible? - I'm sure it's close. - What?! - He's just drilling holes in walls at this point. - My god, Kris, if you ever sell this place- - There's gonna be so many- I'm gonna have to do so much spackling! - No, you're gonna show it. They're gonna be like, \"wow this house is amazing.\" You're gonna take all your panels off. And they're gonna come in, \"What the hell is that?\" - Eighty-five holes in the wall. - It's like constellations, right? Oh, that's actually the great chariot race of Southern Rome. - There's just this? This! - Okay, Kris stop, David stop. - No but I love it so much. I can't wait to take this off and somebody be like, \"what the (beep) is that?\" - Yay! (Kris clapping) Beautiful. - It's not level. - It's not even close. What?! I'm level. - Yeah, that's what I was saying! This isn't level. So that's okay. We can change that. - Yeah, yeah. - Everything's fine. - Sort of. - [Kris] Yeah, it's level. Nice. - Nice. Okay. The audio is noticeably better in here. - It's insanely better already. - This is great. - Which is great. - Everything is working. - Everything's working out. It's so exciting. - We are only two and a half hours in. - Perfect. - And we have put up acoustic panels and a TV. - Okay. Is that bad? - Oh yeah. We are (beep). - Okay. - You do have an upper outlet thing for a TV, but it's here. - Yeah, I don't know. - Why is it here? - I don't know. - Unless you're sitting like 18 inches in front of it, you're gonna be right in front of the freaking door. - Nothing makes sense in this room. - Why would you have your couch here in a room this size? - I actually was curious, too. I don't know if he thought there was gonna be- - There's one here. - Yeah. - It's like three o'clock already and I just found out that we actually have to build the computer. Thank you very much, Asus ROG. - Thank you. - They actually sell completed computers, but their components are great, too. - Yeah. - Do you see this texture? Do you see this? - And then it's not there. - They didn't sand down the drywall mud between the panels. It's the whole house. - This is great. This is why we're getting nothing done. He's just analyzing my entire house and how crappy it is. Its so obvious now, and I didn't notice it because I'm not a painter and he's a painter now, he's going out of his mind. - This is the most rush job bull (beep) paint job that I have seen. - And they painted it like three, four times. Cause' I asked them to keep repainting it. - The (beep) is this? Like I can just see like heads of screws. - Yeah. - Your paint job is so (beep)- - That we don't even need a stud finder. I bet I can find the gaps between the drywall just looking at it. And then yeah, there should be a stud right here. Hit me. (stud finder beeps, both laugh) - [Kris] That's amazing. It's like a super power but it's not. - Okay, please tell me it's level. Oh, it's already here. Wow. - [Kris] That is like as level as it gets. - [Linus] That's really level. Now it's time for some RGB. - Not an original idea. Someone on YouTube had already done this. I saw it and I changed it to work here. But essentially diffused plastic. This is gonna go sit on top just to capture it and then LEDs sit behind. - Wow, cool. - So it has a little shelf. - It's like frosted. That's awesome. - [Linus] Wait, you have a nail gun? - [Callanan] Should I trust you with that? (evil laughter) - [Kris] I just see Final Destination stuff happening immediately. - [Callanan] It has a safety on it. - Okay. So I'm just gonna give her right here. Beautiful. Okay, I'm gonna show you. - [Callanan] Hold on! Hold on! (Linus laughing at himself) - [David] Oh no. - [Callanan] That's why- (Kris laughing) - It's smiling. It's a happy wall. - Happy vibes. - This is our massaging tool. - Can you just get my, I have a knot in- - Yeah, yeah it's kind of a- (tool vibrating) Now that's a vibrator. - Perfect. Great. [Loud hammering] - [Callanan] There you go. - [Linus] Let's go sideways, maybe. - We can't because I have legs. - You have legs? - I have legs. - I was gonna check and see if she had legs. - Oh my god. - This was the top of the line back when we started working on this collab. It's still really good. - Perfect. - Still really good. 3080 TI, it's good. - That's what I had before. - [Callanan] Yeah, it's a little bit special. - It's a TI though. Titanium. - Ah. - [Callanan] It's also a one of one. - Call me curious. - I'm also curious. - No, you're Kris. - That's- - when I got here, I was like, Do I call you kallmekris or Kris? And she's like, \"oh you can just call me Kris.\" It was amazing. - It really was. - It made me so happy. Is it supposed to smell like paint? - Oh, it really does. - Did you paint it? - [Callanan] This is the only white- - That's why it's a one of one. - So that's why my gold controller hasn't been put back together yet. - [Callanan] Look, it was either spend two hours on that or three hours taking apart a controller that Yvonne wants to melt down. - [Linus] It does look really good. - It does look really good. You did a really good job. - [Callanan] Thank you. - [Linus] What's up? What is this? - [Callanan] That's the Evo. So this is all the parts for the Evo. - Are you freaking kidding me? There's four storage drives and all these accessories and crap. - [Callanan] No, no, no. It's so you- - We're doing a vertical GPU Mount, are you freaking kidding me? This is gonna take like three hours to build. - [Callanan] This was optional. - Callanan! - I think he's aged five years since he's been here. I see a gray hair coming in. I can't try. You know what, we can't waste time anymore. We gotta build stuff. I'm not gonna pick out your gray hair. This is why it's taking so long. - Now I think Asus probably has some talking points for me to hit about some of these products, but ain't nobody got time to read any of them, so I'm gonna make them up as I go. This is their ProArt Z690-CREATOR WIFI motherboard. It's designed for creators. PCIE Gen Five, lots of room for storage. Tons of storage. You got like four M.2 PCIE Gen, at least four ports on this thing. We're going with the 12900K cause' the- (drops CPU) Don't worry, I caught it with the foot. 'Cause the KS- - Dropped it twice. - The KS wasn't out yet, I'm assuming. Yep, it's a 12900K. It's got 16 flipping cores. Eight of them are performance, eight of them are the other more different thing. - The speed on this guy. - Efficiency. We've got that CPU in there. This has got lots of heavy VRMs. You got lots of great cooling. It's DDR five so you can run all fast. - Look at this fast CPU placement. - And you got a PCIE Express 5.0 for your graphics card, not that your graphic card supports it. Don't even worry about that, Kris. Can you get me some memory? You're gonna be my lovely assistant. - Okay. - [Linus] Memory is there. Okay, DDR5 So you go ahead and open that up while I dig through the endless piles of freaking storage that crucial apparently provided for this build. We're putting 12 terabytes of SSDs in here? - [Callanan] She doesn't have a server. - She doesn't have- well, we could have built her a server for the cost of this. - [Callanan] Well, you're not wrong. (laughing) - I want you to do a YouTube react video for me. - For this? - Go for it, yeah. - Okay. - You said you wanna do more YouTube stuff, right? - I do do YouTube stuff. - TikTok doesn't pay like jack (beep), right? - It doesn't pay, in Canada, I don't make a dime. - What? - Unless I do a brand deal, there's no creator fund. And I do those far and few between because I don't like filling my page up with brand deals. So I do it because I enjoy it. Even for Americans though, like even when they do pay, they really don't pay that much. - Wow. - Yeah. It's crazy. - (beep) you TikTok. Because they're making money. You know that. - Oh, oh yeah. If you go live on there, they take 80% of- - [David, shouting] What?! - If people tip or anything like that they'll take 80% of it. - [David, shocked] No. - Yeah, so I don't even bother 'cause I don't wanna give TikTok- Like it's crazy. This is really cool. - Okay, hey, she's doing an unboxing video. You saw it here first ladies and gentleman. - I don't do- - Kallmekris unboxing video. - Whoa! - Unboxings are a staple on YouTube. - It's like Christmas! Thank you. - You put the Kris in my Christmas. - That's good. Oh my god, it's so new. It's so beautiful. Look at that. (British accent) Look at that fan. Look at that. And then brought an accent out for you. Just for you. (laughing) - How do you like the case? - It's awesome. - I know, right? (everyone gasps) I did it on purpose. (laughing) - All right, as if my anxiety wasn't already up there. It's to the ceiling. The uneven ceiling. - Okay, tell you what, you can open these for me. Why don't you react to those? - Yes, of course. So much storage that I don't know what to do with. - So normally the graphics card goes in like this. - Yeah, that's like how mine was. - And then with the vertical mount, it goes like this. With that settled then, do you wanna go ahead and install it? - No, I want this to go fast for you. You need to get home home to your wife and children. - These fans are super cool. What you do is you see these little contacts? You just clip them together, like... Oh, I don't know. I don't know how to do it. There we go, like so. And then you only have to hook up one of them. - Nice. - And the whole thing is powered and RGB'd. - That's amazing. - And it's gonna go in a little something like that. - Cool, yes. - Okay. The reason that I'm doing it this way is that I'm far more concerned about cooling for my GPU here. So it's a 3080 TI. This is a non-trivial piece of hardware. Than I am about my CPU because we're using nice fresh air to cool the CPU. This is all nicely heat sinked up here. Not too worried about it. I did wanna have some exhaust fans, but I'm also concerned about running out of RGB headers and what my wiring is gonna look like. So we're gonna go all intake and we're gonna hope that there's enough passive exhaust here that we're not gonna run into trouble because this is gonna be kind of fighting against this fan. But I want this facing this way, blowing air in, because it's easier for maintenance, it's easier for cleaning. But what do you think Callanan? Am I gonna get away with this? All intake, all the time? [Uneasy noises] - [Kris] I love that sound. - It's borderline. Isn't it? - [Callanan] Yeah, remember the last time you decided- - [Linus, Shouting] I remember the last time! This is better than that time! - [Callanan] You do have the intake from the bottom instead of from the top. - Yes I know. - [Callanan] So you're not fighting physics on this one. - Well, that's not that difference maker. - [Callanan] That was the difference maker. - It didn't help. Callanan, who paid for this? [Confused Noises] These are balling stereo speakers. - I can see that. - How do you like it so far? - It's looking pretty. - Yeah, I know right? - Looking real nice. - You got all that ROG goodness. We'll put this in here. We are one power cable short of a powered up graphics card here, ladies and gentlemen. - [Callanan] There should be a bag that has it. - Wait, perfect. - [Callanan] You scared me for a second. - No, you scared me for a second. - [Callanan] No, you scared me. - You scared me. - [Callanan] No, we scared each other. - Oh my god. You guys are like an old married couple. - Always with the age ism. - Okay, I'm sorry. - You know what she said to me? She's like, \"yeah, it's kind of cool, meeting people who have been in social media forever.\" - I said for so long. - Yeah, that's so different. That's such a non synonymous way to put it. - It's different! It's a compliment. - What is up with you guys? On the one hand, I think you kind of like me because you're always hanging out with me in the live streams, watching the videos. But whenever you see someone take me down a notch or five, you're just like, \"woo!\" Yeah! - It's healthy, it's good. His ego is just getting a little too big. You gotta knock him down a little bit, a little bit more lower than he is already. - [Callanan] Ohhhh! - Oh, by the way, I never gave you an update on this, but I remember they're the fans from the AIO. I didn't use these ones on the AIO. I forget why I didn't, but I put them in the top. So now we're gonna go intake along the side and bottom and we're gonna go exhaust out the top and probably still have a little bit of positive pressure. This is gonna be a totally awesome setup. It'll be fine. I know you did the whole hairdressing thing, but did you ever do like esthetician? Like do like nails and stuff? - I was a hairdresser and I did lash extensions. So yeah. - But you're like a full hairdresser? - Yes, I'm a licensed hairdresser. - Okay, is there any hope for me? This haircut, you know, what would you do? - You need to do something with it. I would a hundred percent take in the sides more and then put a little bit off the top, like a solid inch off the top at least. - Like a solid inch, okay. So I'm getting a Kallmekris haircut after this. - Yeah! Oh my god, that'd be great. - Yeah? - And the little mullet thing you got going on in the back, maybe just like trim that up a little bit. - The whole thing? This better? - That's great. This is improvement. A hundred percent. (laughing) - Kris, how is the last monitor still not open? - These boxes are confusing! - You're just watching me build the computer. - I didn't wanna ask, you looked like you were busy. It's like child proof. It's Kris proof. That's what it is. - Did I mention? Thank you Asus for sponsoring this. You have Thunderbolt 4 and lots of 10 gig USB, and 10 gig ethernet and two and a half gig ethernet, it's fast. I'm so tired. - I know, I'm losing my mind. Yeah. Okay. - Holy (beep). - I know, there's a lot. - Yep, we shamelessly broke this up into two parts, but there's good news. You can check out part two now over on floatplane.com or if you're looking for some more chaotic energy Linus builds a PC with someone, I don't know, you can check out the two-man collab.",

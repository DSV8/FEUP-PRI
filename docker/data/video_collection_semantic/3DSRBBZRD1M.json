    "transcript": "this is the LG G7 ThinQ or think it's such an odd name so I'm gonna refer to this as a g7 but it's the successor to the very popular g6 that was launched last year and I had a lot of good things to talk about the device and of course a few concerns as well but here we are in 2018 with LG's response to the samsung galaxy s9 the Oneplus 6 the iPhone 10 and a few recent ones so having used this device for the past few weeks I'm here to share 7 things that you really need to know before buying the LG G7 so let's dive in but first a quick message from our sponsor evolved with the times consider nvme storage today the new RC 100 brings affordable nvme storage into your hands with various capacities in this super compact form factor that points directly into you motherboard it's extremely powerful and utilizes the Sheba's advance through the flash memory for awesome speeds so you can be a happy user the RC 100 by Toshiba the nvme Drive to consider check it out below alright so the first thing that caught my attention right away after booting the g7 was the display it's definitely one of the best panels that have taken a look at this year apart from the galaxy s9 it spans six point one inches and I'll talk about the size a little bit later on and it features qhd+ resolution so the content looks very sharp and clear especially when watching content that supports our resolution it's perfect for YouTube videos and Netflix the panel technology used here is IPS instead of amyloid and have nothing to complain about that the color reproduction is natural not too saturated like Samsung's and the viewing angles are on point so great stuff LG interestingly enough LG has implemented a different color matrix within the display in this case it's RGB W instead of the standard RGB that means there's a separate white channel for the backlit to pass through resulting in consistent color uniformity as well as incredible brightness this thing has a boosted mode within the settings tab that increases the luminosity of the panel making it comfortable to view content in direct sunlight seriously it's pretty awesome we're talking a thousand nits in technical terms then there is the notch sadly it's a new trend this year ever since the launch of the essential phone and the iPhone 10 and what's even saddening is that there is no other way to distinguish this device from the competition but it has grown on me and quite frankly I'm actually loving it so you do have little things like your time your notification pop-ups your battery status that sort of tuck away in that area really well and it gives you more real estate when it comes to viewing the content you also do have the option to hide the knotch within the settings so it's great that we have those options and I think I'm okay with that next up is the rear facing wide-angle lens now I don't mean to praise the quality of the image coming out of that lens and I'll get to that portion a bit later in this video but it's specifically the wide-angle aspect you see we're so used to the dual lens setups on most modern smartphones and the majority of them are standard lens and a telephoto lens whereas with LG smartphones the wide-angle lens is a unique addition that lets you compose some great shots giving you a different perspective capturing a lot more subjects in the frame and you can see that with these images now one could argue that there are lens add-ons available in the market that you can just simply add on or simply clip on top of the standard lens on most smartphones and you can achieve that wide aspect or that wide perspective but it's an add-on that you're supposed to carry around and I'm gonna chime in Dimitri here to talk about that a little bit now my keeper said this whole wide angle perspective is awesome on the smartphone because you're able to capture so much information from your particular place or setting and it's a lot more immersive than having to zoom in on a particular pixel with a telephoto lens and I wish more Android phones had that wide angle perspective and so this is where the clip-on lenses are quite important they can be attached to any smartphone they vary in focal lengths so if you want a fisheye wide-angle a super zoom and macro so it's awesome because they can be adapted to your environment now the thing is optically they're not perfect especially this really cheap kit that I picked up for like $25 that you know there's a lot of flair there's a lot of distortion and optically they're not as clear as if you would just take a picture with a normal camera but they give you that additional perspective allowing you to capture a lot more information and I really love the macro capabilities especially because you can get really close to subject and just capture things you would normally be able to do with your standard camera and I feel like the g7 has done that super wide angle perspective right there's no distortion you know the lines are exactly straight but if you are eager for that additional wide angle perspective then clip-on lenses are for you look them up in description below different price points and different brands different qualities but they are an option to expand that field of view Eber back to you my next favorite feature of the g7 is the inclusion of the 32-bit hi-5 Quantic now this might not be a huge deal for some of you out there but it's certainly something to appreciate especially when you pair it up with some high-end headphones this guy can easily drive my Achy g/km nexus as well as my HD 5 9x without breaking a sweat the sound is richer more detailed and refined it's way more superior to the pixel 2 which by the way uses an external DAC through the USBC dongle the cheery on top of the stack is that the user has the option to manually go into the settings and play around with different presets and eq's defined tune you're comfortable setting awesome stuff LG okay let's talk about the design and to be honest I'm a bit on the fence about this one first up it's the form factor this phone is huge I mean for one hand operation it's really not that feasible especially when you're trying to reach the top spots so that's something to consider next up is the glass back it can get super greasy over time and it could potentially cause drops as well because once the surface gets slippery then it's just a matter of when you accidentally dropped the smartphone so I'd be extra careful when it comes to handling especially if you like to use your smartphone as is without any case or skin something else that can be improved is the frame and by that I mean the finish now if you recall the g7 actually featured an aluminum frame which was a lot more solid and sturdier to hold my hand because the matte finish was actually it just helped a little bit with the grip when it comes to holding the smartphone whereas with the stainless steel body or the stainless between construction the phone can you can easily just slip it it's easily a slippery surface and can pick up scratches faster as well so that's something to consider also remember that the glass back and stainless steel edges are continuing problem with many modern smartphones and they aren't exclusive to LG this is why many of us choose to buy a case or wrap them in a skin so my commentary here is about the smartphone market in general without pointing a finger directly at LG I think it's time to look at smartphone finishes in a whole new way next up are the speakers and it's not that great especially when it comes to viewing content in landscape mode you can easily mute that which can get a little annoying at times I would have wished if they created sort of a dual or stereo imaging by using or biking taking advantage of the fun facing speaker on the left side of the display now LG has implemented a pretty cool feature called the boombox speaker and it essentially resonates the sound coming out of the drivers into the chassis creating this room filling experience a few places on top of the desk or any sort of surface it gives you a much richer sound quality compared to the Sounders that's just coming out of this one speaker whereas you've got this whole chassis that's emitting that sound and it sort of fills the room really well it is something it's a pretty cool feature in my opinion but I really didn't see myself taking advantage of that because I typically watch content with with the phone on my hands so it really doesn't make much of a difference the second last thing that I have to talk about is the software experience you see I feel like LG is really not taking any feedback from previous reviews from the g6 or the g5 because it really is the exact same experience from those smartphones I mean the whole phone is loaded with a lot of bloatware apps and it's got the LG's skin on top of Android so it really slows down the experience as well because interestingly enough I did a quick speed comparison launching apps on the g7 and the pixel one by one and the pixel was actually a lot faster than the g7 and it really proves that software optimization is still not present even though the g7 has the 845 processor compared to the 835 on the pixels so it all comes down to optimization LG still hasn't learned from their mistakes the other thing that really boggles me is that this phone is still running Android 8.0 and that's just unacceptable because we're almost near to the Android P upgrade and they're still sticking with something that's a year old or almost that was out last year and it's just unacceptable in my opinion LG has a really bad history when it comes to updating their software so ultimately I just really can recommend this phone if you're looking for something software experience and the last thing that I feel needs improvement here is the camera performance you see I love the inclusion of the wide-angle lens on the smartphone because it helps you compose some unique shots but the end result is not that great as you can see these samples don't retain a lot of the details plus the highlights are blown out in many cases I also noticed a shadow like was a bit longer especially when shooting HDR and in some cases I was also able to notice some color shift with some of the images resulting in a weird green shift which wasn't unpleasant now when it comes to taking selfies LG is slower to catch up on this front as I wouldn't describe the results here as spectacular since there are other smartphones on the market that can do better in this price range now there is a manual mode within the app that lets you adjust the ISO shutter speed white balance etc but again the software processing just cripples the sensors true potential perhaps an update could make a day-and-night of a difference you never know so those are these seven things that you need to know before buying the LG G7 just to quickly recap the things that I loved about this device is displayed it's just super bright and very color accurate in my opinion the wide-angle lens is a great implementation I loved including this feature in the first place because it lets you capture a lot of subjects not necessarily a fan of the process or the quality coming out of the sensor and the last thing is of course inclusion on the hi-fi DAC because really when it comes to listening to music when you pair it up with a good pair of headphones it's just amazing the things I didn't like about this device are the design the speaker implementation software experience and of course the camera performance it really does boggle down it really takes away from using the device in the first place because you're looking for a smart phone especially within the six hundred to a thousand dollar price range you are expecting a pretty solid experience for that price and I think LG could tidy up a few things with a software update you never know so that's the g7 from LG what do you guys think about it in fact if you're willing to spend $750 in a smart phone where would this be on that list would it be somewhere between the Oneplus 6 and the Galaxy S9 or would it be somewhere else love to hear your thoughts I'm Eber with Hardware Canucks thank you so much for watching make sure to check out our new boot sequence Channel and of course we have relevant content whatever here thanks again for watching and we'll see you and next one",

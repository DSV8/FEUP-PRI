    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here! And this is the Xiaomi Air 12. Now this is a device that a lot of people have been asking me to do a review for. I never did it when it first launched because it's a product that is difficult to purchase, if you're in North America, and there's some inherent risks that come with purchasing a device from a smaller company like Xiaomi. But the thing that makes this thing special is that it's kinda like the \"rip-off version\", the \"knock-off version\", of the MacBook 12\". It's often compared to this because of it's shape, it's size, and it's components, so I thought I would kinda do a video to showcase the two, so that you guys can have a realistic comparison between the two. One of the more important things about this device is the build quality. This is a very high quality device, it's built really well compared to a lot of ultrabooks at this price point. So this thing actually starts at around $500, maybe $550 depending on where you purchase it from. This one in particular was from GearBest, and it cost around $530. Now the design language is quite similar to the MacBook, not that they're identical, but you can see that it's obviously been inspired by Apple's design. Simple, flat slab, and this one actually has no branding or marking on the top of it, it's actually difficult to tell which company this product came from just by looking at it. Now in terms of its thickness, this one's thicker and heavier, but it's very comfortable to hold still. The device is well made for the price, it's not super solid, I wouldn't say it's as well-built as a MacBook, and I wouldn't say it's as durable as a MacBook, in terms of, like, when you press on it and how much flex there is. But it's surprisingly well-made, and I would say it's better-made than almost any other ultrabook at this price point. So the keyboard has some flex to it, it's not a lot. Uhh... I mean, it's not as rigid as a MacBook, I'll demonstrate on the MacBook. It's a little more rigid, but it's not a huge difference. The display that they're using is a 1080 panel, it's not as high resolution as the MacBook panel, it's also not as bright, nor as color-accurate. But it's a really nice screen nonetheless. It's also not a touchscreen, despite it being a glossy finish as well. The keyboard on the Xiaomi is actually pretty good, I would say it's easier to get used to than the MacBook keyboard. I like how everything just feels like a regular keyboard on this, there's no super-thin butterfly switches or anything, it's very comfortable to type on. The one thing I don't like is the trackpad, not that it's a bad trackpad, but I definitely prefer the MacBook trackpad. This uses a Synaptic driver, so it's not ideal, but it's not bad. Okay, let's talk about ports. So Xiaomi was smart, they realized that not everyone likes that whole \"single port\" thing on the MacBook. These guys have a single HDMI port, an audio jack, and then on the other side we have the USB-A and USB-C. Performance on this machine is pretty good. I mean, on paper it doesn't look amazing, it's a Sky Lake m3. But when you compare it for just actual use, regular use, day-to-day stuff, it performs really well. It's not as fast as an i5 or an i7, but unless you're doing more CPU-intensive stuff, you probably won't notice a difference. One thing to note: the MacBook from 2016 is actually running the same processor, but the clockspeed is a little bit higher, so this particular chip, you can kinda ramp up the speed if you throw enough wattage at it, and that's what Apple has done. They're running the stock speeds, so 0.9 GHz, but when I use them, they feel really similar. If you want to play games on the Xiaomi, you can play some really light titles, but anything even mildly intense just won't run very well on this system. The speakers on the Xiaomi are actually not bad, they're better than most ultrabook speakers at this size, but they're still not as good as the MacBook speakers, and I'll give you a little quick speaker test. So, obviously, MacBook has better speakers, but this thing's a lot cheaper, yeah. Okay, we're going to take a look at the inside, pretty easy to get in there, it's some torx screws. On the inside, you can see the single SATA stick that they include. The weird thing is that they have two M.2 slots, there's only one of them that supports SATA, and then the other one supports PCIe, you have to use specifically those interfaces for those two sticks. The battery's pretty big, it's actually 37 watt hours, the MacBook has a 41 watt hour battery, and you're going to get slightly better battery life on that thing. You're going to get around 9 hours on the MacBook, around 7 hours on this, even though this has only a slightly smaller battery. The RAM is unfortunately soldered-on, it's 4 gigs and you're stuck with 4 gigs regardless of the configuration. And lastly you'll notice there's no fans, it's a completely silent system, with the ultra low-voltage CPU. But everything in here looks nicely packed together, there's no wasted space in here or anything. Thermal output is comfortable, I mean, it is an ultra low-voltage chip, so nothing gets super hot or anything. If you're curious about the webcam, it looks better than the MacBook webcam. 720p, the MacBook has a 480p cam. So the ultimate question is whether or not the Xiaomi Air 12 is worth the price, because as you could see in this review, the MacBook is better across the board, except for a few things. So like, the keyboard on the Xiaomi is better, arguably, the ports selection is better on the Xiaomi, and, well, the webcam is better on the Xiaomi. But aside from that, the MacBook is better all around the board, other than the fact that it runs OS X, that's a preference thing. So is it worth it? I think it is. It's really difficult to compare something like this when the price is so different. But if you're looking to purchase something that's like a thin-and-light ultrabook, It-- I've always felt that the MacBook was just too expensive for what it offered. This thing gives surprisingly good value at this price. The only thing, and really, the only thing that holds me back from just being like, \"Hey, everyone just go buy this thing!\" is the fact that it has to come from China, or somewhere in Asia, and if there are problems with this laptop, you're going to have a tough time getting it fixed. That's the end of this video, hope you guys enjoyed it. Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it! I'll see you guys next time.",

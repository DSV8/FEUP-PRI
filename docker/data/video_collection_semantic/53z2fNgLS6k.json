    "transcript": "- It's Christmas and that means it's time for the David Bombal Christmas giveaway. Are you ready to win a prize or a gift? I'm gonna be giving away prizes and gifts everyday from today until Christmas. So you have a chance to win something. (funky music) Merry Christmas. (funky music) Merry Christmas. Now I'm gonna be giving away a lot of prizes and gifts during these videos. So you have to be quick to win some of these prizes. Make sure that you subscribe to my YouTube channel and that you click on the bell to get notifications when I post a new video. Again, you have to be very quick to win some of these prizes. But hold on a minute. David, where are you? David, I'm in South Africa enjoying the beautiful sunshine. Well the weather here is per usual. It's wet and it's cold and it's dark. It's summer here in the southern hemisphere which also makes it a lot nicer. Can enjoy the beach, enjoy the beautiful weather. You definitely look a lot better with a tan. Is it Christmas in South Africa? (laughing) Of course it's Christmas here. We're kind of in the same time zone. There's only about two hours difference between here and the UK. Even though I'm on the other side of the world it's still Christmas. Which means it's time for a Christmas giveaway. It's time to give people some nice prizes and some nice gifts. So what prizes are we giving away today? Now it's a bit windy today. Hopefully you can hear me clearly David. I've had to redo my videos because the good news is we've got more stuff to give away. So there's no problems rerecording because it means that you watching have a better opportunity of winning some of these gifts and prizes that we're giving away. Now to start us off everyone, yes everyone including you will get access to a Python course. This course was created by Chuck Black, a good friend of mine. He's got over 30 years of development experience. He's developed products for HBE. He's developed software defined networking or SDN products. He's developed products for financial institutions. In other words Chuck knows what he's talking about. Over 30 years of experience doing development. And he's gonna teach you the basics of Python. If you wanna become a software developer or you're a network engineer who wants to learn what strings are, what dictionaries are, what other basic concepts are in Python, Chuck's course can help you learn those concepts and help you become a better network engineer or a programmer. So to start us off everyone will get access to this Python course as a thank you from me to you to say thank you for a fantastic 2019. But in addition one person is gonna win access to the Boson ExSim software for the CEH certification. So if you're studying for your CEH certification this will help you pass that exam. The Boson software is fantastic. The ExSim software has a money back guarantee. If you don't pass your exam Boson will refund you your money so that really shows you that they stand behind their products. But have a look at Reddit, have a look online at the feedback from people who have used the Boson software for their CCNA exams or other exams. The feedback is very very good. The Boson software is excellent. And to continue the giveaway two people are gonna win access to the Boson NetSim software. In this case it's the CCNA NetSim software valued at $179. It'll help you pass the CCNA exam by taking you through structured labs so you will learn how to configure network devices and parse the simulations in the CCNA exam. Great software. But in addition one person is gonna win access to the Boson ExSim software. This is exam preparation software that helps you prepare for the CCNA exam. So two people will get access to the Boson NetSim software and one person will get access to the Boson ExSim software. So that's what we're giving away David. Over to you in the UK. So what are you gonna do in 2020 to change your life? Don't focus on the mistakes of the past. Don't focus on the things that you did wrong or the things that you didn't do that you should've done. Focus on the future and change your life everyday. Everyday is a brand new beginning or a brand new opportunity to change the direction of your life. If you're going in the wrong direction then change your life by making changes today to set you on the right path. It's said that insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. If you're doing the same thing over and over again and it's giving you the results that you don't want then change what you're doing to give you different results. So what are you gonna do in 2020 to change your life? Are you gonna get your CCNA certification? Are you gonna get your CCMP or perhaps your CCIE certification? So that's from a study and certification point of view. But what are you gonna do in your personal life? Are you gonna exercise more? Are you gonna ask that girl out that you've been wanting to ask out for a long time? Are you going to ask her to marry you? What are you going to do? How are you gonna change your life? Now in the comments below let me know what certifications you're planning to get in 2020. Are you planning to get your CCNA? What about CCMP or CCIE? What about another certification? What certifications are you planning to get in 2020? What are your plans in 2020? What are you hoping to accomplish next year? Now you can enter using the links below this video for either the CEH exam software or the Boson NetSim CCNA software. So from a sunny South Africa I wanna wish everyone all the best for 2020. Go and conquer your dreams and your goals. (upbeat music) Merry Christmas. (upbeat music) Merry Christmas.",

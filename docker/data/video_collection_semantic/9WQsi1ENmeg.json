    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine. And today we're gonna be going into the metaverse. Like, what is a metaverse? There's not just gonna be one metaverse, there's gonna be many, many metaverses. So why I thought this would be a fun video to kind of integrate the metaverse into is because I partnered with prime video to talk about the \"Upload.\" So season two of the \"Upload\" is out now and I actually got a chance answer to chat with Robbie Amel during season one of the \"Upload.\" Now, before we get into all of that the whole concept of \"Upload\" and this show, is fascinating because they kind of are giving you sort of this decision of, do you want to upload your consciousness when you die? Now, when you do pass on, you're able to take basically all of your memories, everything that you've ever lived and experienced and you can continue to live on in this digital world. But where this gets interesting is people from your past or I guess your current life that are still actually alive, are able to come into this digital world to see you and interact. There's even like a spoiler alert. There's a love suit. Yeah, that's a thing. So it's kind of fascinating the way that this show kind of explored this whole other possible world of what would it be like if we could take all of our thoughts, all of our memories, basically what makes us a person and upload it to the cloud. I loved season one and now that season two is out, you guys can watch that on Prime video. Put a link in the description if you guys wanna check it out. And not only that, I am so excited because Robbie Amel actually made us a little video that I'm going to show you right here. - Hey Justine. So pumped me back with you for season two of \"Upload.\" I mean, a lot has happened since season one. You can now increase the size of your biceps. Not that I would ever do that. Of course, I'm all natural, but it is an option. If someone were to wanna do it. There's also some negatives, privacy. It's becoming a big problem here at Lakeview. There's a thing called mind frisk, where they can read your thoughts, just be careful. And also my buddy Luke thinks that they may be spying on his dreams. He's a little nuts. So take that with a grain salt. Anyway, I hope you have a blast and just to be careful. There's a lot of great, but there's also a little bit of scary. Now, if you haven't checked out season one of \"Upload\" make sure you check out the video Justine and I did on her channel last year. Have fun Justine, and I will see you in Lakeview, hopefully not too soon, but one day. - Thank you, Robbie. We cannot wait to see you in season two. And if you guys haven't watched season one first, I highly recommend watch season one and then binge your way all the way through season two. It's just such an interesting show from like the perspective of giving you this choice of like, would you want to continue to live on in a digital world after your real life body is no more. It's really crazy to think about, but thankfully I don't have to make that decision right now because I have a little headset right here that we're going to put on and we're gonna go into the metaverse, averse of digital beings. And I don't even know what's gonna happen because I haven't really explored this whole world. And I thought this would be a really fun video to kind of have this be sort of like my first time in the metaverse, like, what is it like out there? What are the differences between this kind of metaverse and the actual metaverse of Lakeview? Which is the place that your consciousness is uploaded in season one and season two of the \"Upload.\" So yeah, I guess, let's hop into it. I told my sister to meet me there but she doesn't know what she's doing either. So we kind of just gonna try to figure this out. Okay, we're going in? Oh, my gosh. All right, controllers aren't connected. Well, where are my controllers? Oh, no. Hey Jenna. - [Jenna] Hey. - Hey, okay, so I just ordered some food in the real verse. I can't see any in front of me, I guess. Do we meet up now? Let me see how we do this. Okay, so pop it in. Yeah, the problem is this is so heavy on my head. Everything feels so heavy. - [Jenna] Oh yeah. - Is this the metaverse? I'm preparing for visitors. Here we go. Okay, so what if I click hangout? What happens here? Okay, so this thing, put your hands in and hold hands to party up and explore horizon together. Okay, I'm in. Oh my God, there's somebody there. Hey. - You're gonna have to play. - Anybody here? Hello? - I'm gonna follow this dude around. - Oh, anybody? - Hello, yeah, okay. - [Jenna] You're in a party chat, can they hear you? - I don't know, man. Let me see. I wanna talk to this new friend that I've just made. - [Jenna] I'm gonna look around for you harassing this person. - Hey, no, don't go anywhere. Hey, come here. Dude, he just said he wanted to have a friend and I'm freaking here and now he's not. Oh, hi. - What's up? - [Jenna] Are you up on the top of a upstairs? - I was hanging. - [Jenna] Where are you? - I don't know, are we in a different metaverse? - [Jenna] I'm in the Plaza, really. - I don't know if I can talk. Is this working? Hello. - [Jenna] I also found- - I just took a picture. What is happening? This is so silly. I'm trying to make a friend. - I dunno what you're trying to tell me. - [Jenna] This kid sounds like he's five. Can you hear me, can you hear me? - Hello. - Oh yeah, I can hear you now. What's up? - This is so exciting. Well, I was in a party chat with my sister but now I can't find her. She's disappeared. - This kid's talking about this girl, Victoria. How he likes her. - Me too. Okay, I'll be right back. I'm gonna see if I can bring her here. - This kid is talking about liking this girl in school. - Like I thought that this was gonna be like a super simple thing. - [Jenna] That's funny that you thought that. - My face is itchy, how do you itch your face in metaverse? - [Jenna] You don't. - It's so itchy. Okay, I'm gonna look at my wrist. I have a notification here. There's no one here. It's me and one other dude. - [Jenna] There's some kids growing paper airplanes. - Yeah, I think we're in two different metaverses I don't think our verses are syncing right now. Shoot, my name is- - Hey Justine. - My name's IJustine on here. - [Jenna] Okay, worlds. - Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. - [Jenna] Oh, okay. All right, I love you. Hey - Invite to world. - [Man] Hey. - Oh, some people are saying that they love each other in here, is loving the metaverse? - [Jenna] Okay, I'm teleporting somewhere. I was gonna say, and I thought hanging out with people in real life was exhausting. - I'm so exhausted. You see me? - [Jenna] Turn around. - I can't. - [Jenna] Turn around. I can't get out of this freaking notification. I'm stuck. Like get out of it. Hey, oh my God, your outfit's cute. Okay, you're in my notifi- You're in- - [Jenna] Hello? - Hi. - Okay, hold on a second. Wait, move, you're in my set. How do you have your settings? - [Jenna] Like how did you do that? Where is everybody? - Oh, you see me? So now that we're here- - [Jenna] Easier way to turn. - Okay, yeah, teleport slide. - [Jenna] You shot me. - I shot you? - [Jenna] You hit me with your finger. You went poo pew. - Oh, you know what we can do. Hold on, here. - [Jenna] I feel uncomfortable. - Where's the other half of your body. Let's go, let's see what's over here. Do you wanna come over here? Come on over here. - [Jenna] Are you standing in real life? - No, I'm sitting, I'm sitting. - [Jenna] I'm gonna jump off, ready? - Oh, me too. Uh-oh! Oh God, oh no, wait, I'm floating. Oh, we're back to the beginning. So is this what we do now? - [Jenna] Yeah, come follow me up here. - Grab to start. Oh, that's my microphone. I can't grab it because- Oops, that's my desk. This is a problem. - [Jenna] Okay, follow me again. - Dude, I'm trying, I'm honestly gonna throw up. I don't do well in VR. - [Jenna] I mean I'm getting very ill because I get motion sickness. - Oh my gosh, I'm so- - [Jenna] You stopped? - Yeah, I don't know if I can be in here much longer. - [Jenna] Watch me, watch me. - Wow! - Did you watch it? Did you see it? - Yeah, I did. You can do it too. - [Jenna] Oh, that's bad through. - Hey, look over here. (Justine laughing) - [Jenna] Oh, you hit me. - Did you feel? - [Jenna] Okay, watch. - I didn't feel it. - [Jenna] What if I can catch it? - You can try, ready? (Justine gasps) - [Jenna] I can. - Yeah, you caught it. Oh, went away. - [Jenna] Too fast, here. - Oh, shoot, I caught it. I'm so talented. Oh my God, you're so talented. So the reason that I wanted to test this out was to see what the metaverse was all about. This kind of ties into season two of the \"Upload\" there sort of metaverses, you're basically uploading your consciousness. So like there's no headset because like you're dead. So like after you die, this is where you go. This experience is a very subpar experience compared to what Lakeview is like in the actual show. But of course you're also dead, so- - [Jenna] Well, yeah, can you come off for a headset? What's at the top of the tree house? I see you. - Oh God, I'm gonna fall. - [Jenna] Take my hand. - I don't think I can... Oh, I've fallen. Can I jump over here? - [Jenna] Yeah, take my hand. - Okay, all right.} - Well, let's skip it. Let's go over here. Let's go to the space station. - Should we go in this building? - [Jenna] Oh, I'm really dizzy. - Dude, you took me up here. It's a little teleportation. I feel nauseous. Who's this dude? Look at this dude with the hat on. Oh, I just invited you. Hey, what's up, what's over here. Like what's the space station. We can do this? Hey dude. - [Jenna] Hello. - We visit this world? I think I visited a world. - [Jenna] Where are we going? - Do you guys come with me? The space station. Oh, this is good, definitely make me vomit. - [Jenna] Are you in these like green tube things? - Yeah, I'm in a green tube thing. I just really don't know about what we do here. Jenna, I guess, thanks for hanging out in the metaverse world. I've lost you in space. - [Jenna] Yeah. - But this was really fun. I think we should this again after we kind of figure out how to do it. - [Jenna] This was fun. - Maybe we could have like a metaverse meetup. - [Jenna] We should do that. That sounds good. - Definitely should. Okay, well, my wrist has told me that it's 5:20 PM and I've ordered dinner in the real world. So I'm gonna go check that out. - [Jenna] Okay. - Okay. Well, thanks for hanging out. - [Jenna] Bye. - Bye, I think. - [Jenna] Bye bye. - Oh my God, how did I end up over here? I'm sideways, like I'm completely sideways. All right, well that's something we did. I think that I might prefer to hang out in Lakeview because this experience was less than stellar and Lakeview looks incredible. They have delicious snacks. They have a beautiful buffet of breakfast foods, and it seems like a much more premium experience than what I just experienced (laughs). Thank you Prime Video of sponsoring this video. Again, check out the link of the description if you guys wanna get more information about the \"Upload\" season two. And like I said, make sure you binge season one so you'll be prepped for season two. With that my friends, I will see you in some verse. I don't know which one it's gonna be, but I feel like maybe, I don't know. I feel dizzy. (upbeat classical music) How I move. Okay, well there we go. Look at my beautiful world that I live here. Oh, my God, I would totally be lounging over there. I'm in the metaverse now, baby. Do you even know anything about anything? Oh, I'm gonna throw up. This is absolutely nauseating. Get me out. Get me out of this. Oh my God. I can't, there's freaking... I'm putting my hands in front of my face like it's gonna do something. Freaking quit. Oh my God, the elephant's coming towards me. Shut up, shut up. Shut up, quit. Oh my God, help. - [Man] Just push the button. - Dude, I'm pushing it. Get me out, quit. - [Man] Just press any of the buttons. - Which one is that? Quit. - [Man] There you go. (Justine sighs) (man laughing) - Get me out.",

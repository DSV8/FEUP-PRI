    "transcript": "- Greetings Internet, Ken here from the Computer Clan and oh my gosh, speaking of Internet. The Internet will just find any excuse to argue over anything. (vocal recording playing) There's this audio clip going around and no one can agree on what it's saying. It's kind of like that whole dress thing all over again. The dress was blue and black though for the record. This one's actually a little more tricky because it depends on your hearing, your age, what kind of speakers are listening to the sound on, and a bunch of other factors. So it's actually kind of fun to try to figure out what's really going on. Now I can use all sorts of technology and science to spoil what the answer is and I can go into a deep explanation but you probably just want a quick answer. So I'll give you a quick answer if you promise to stay and watch a little bit more of my explanation. Please, I'm desperate for attention. I need it. So here it is, Yanny or Laurel? What is this mysterious audio clip truly saying? The answer is... Laurel. Yes, the official audio does say Laurel. That's what the guy said when he recorded it. The guy in question here is Brad Story, PhD, a professor at the University of Arizona and he teaches speech perception. Hmm, look at that. What makes this so confusing? Why is it so mysterious and ambiguous and why is there a debate about it? It has a lot to do with how we hear this sound. If we open it up in a spectral analyzer we can see the waveform. The darker the colors, the quieter the sound. The warmer the colors, the louder the sound. So warmer is more amplitude and then we have the frequencies on the y-axis and the time on the x-axis. You can see there's almost two odd curvy shapes going on here. We have one curvy shape near the bottom and one curvy shape near the top. If you play the sound, depending on how you hear and depending on what kind of speakers you're using, you might hear Yanny or Laurel. Again, Laurel is the official word said in this recording. Now, if we isolate some of the higher frequencies around maybe the 3, 4 and 5 KHz region, we'll start hearing more of the sounds, at least I started hearing more of the sounds that sound like Yanny. (vocal recording playing) Again, listening to all the frequencies I hear Laurel. But when I isolate those, like three to four to 5 KHz frequencies, I hear more of the Yanny sounds. If you lower the pitch of this you'll start shifting from Laurel down to Yanny because we're taking those higher frequencies and moving them down and now we're starting to hear some more Yanny show up. (vocal recording playing) Yes, the word Laurel was said but those higher frequencies were added in there to kind of make it more mysterious and to mix it up. And because it's kind of like we're hearing two things at once it depends on the circumstances under which we hear the sound that determines what we're actually hearing. Remember that bar versus far experiment? Or how about the bill, bill, bill, pail, pail, pail, mayo, mayo, mayo, little experiment. A lot of hearing has to do with context especially with what we're seeing. If we're seeing a certain word or certain image when we're hearing another word, our brain will use the information together and we might be hearing something totally different than what's actually being said. It's kind of an \"earlusion\", if you will. So yes, you may hear something totally different but I'm gonna say it is Laurel, the original recorder said it's Laurel, and go ahead and open up the file in something like Adobe Audition and play around with it a bit and analyze it. Look at the waveforms, look at the spectral waveform analyzer, and just have fun with it. And let me know what you guys are hearing and if you have any questions feel free to let me know but I just wanted to crank this out quick because gosh darn it the Internet is ripping itself apart again and we just can't have that. So thanks for watching and I'll see you in the not-too-distant future.",

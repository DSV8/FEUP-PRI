    "transcript": "(Zack) So we are here at the headquarters of iFixit. Im here with Kyle, hes the CEO of iFixit and were talking about cell phones, reparability, and durability. So Kyle I have a question for you. (Kyle) Alright. (Zack) Were pretty into the repairing of cell phones. What, for you, is the ideal cell phone? So we have different materials they can be made out of, plastic, glass or metal. Which one do you prefer? (Kyle) Well, I like quality materials. So if you look at, I mean, the higher end flagships phones that are investing more in the materialsyou know, the iPhone is a very durable phone in general. So I think that theres a lot to be said for what Apples done. I have an iPhone and in general, like the metal that they have done, right, it has a pretty good build quality. I have here, this is a 50 dollar Android phone that they sell in India and this is reasonable. This is more close to like an old school Nokia phone. But I definitely like robust, durable materials. I dont really have any problem with the metal. I think you could also build a plastic phone that stood the test of time, but it would probably need to be a higher quality plastic than you see here. Maybe a little bit thicker. (Zack) Ok, so in your ideal Smartphone would it be metal or plastic? You have to pick just one. (Kyle) Ha, ha I have to pick! Yeah, I could go either way. I mean I would want I just want a rugged case. So if its metal thats taking the impactif its plasticI can go either way. But I think that, you know, in your bend tests that youve shown that if you go with.like that plastic phone youve got over there, thats the extreme side of flimsy plastic. But I think you could do some things with polycarbonate. So I would say Im more about the functionality and I dont really care how you get there. (Zack) Ok. And so as far as what about internals go? So if yourewhen you go to buy a Smartphone, you have the iPhone right now, what is the most important aspect for you? As far as reparability, battery lifewhat do you look for? (Kyle) So the crazy thing about most phones these days is its gotten really commoditized. There really isnt as big a difference between all the phones on the market as there was three or four years ago. Everything has a camera. The flagship phones all have pretty good cameras. So we can sit here and we can really nitpick the differences. But the difference between the S7 camera and the 6s camera isnt huge, right? Theyre both really good cameras within the form factor. What I would say is make the thing bigger. Like I actually dont need a bigger screen, I think this screen could even be made a bit smaller. But like, give me more room for the camera. Or, like the biggest design flaw with the iPhone, I have my own bumper I added, but the design flaw is the camera bump, right. So they could have given me 25% more battery life if they just made the entire phone as thick as the camera. So theyre sitting here and its funny when you see interviews with Johnny, Apples famous designer, and you say what do you think about the bump? And hes like, well, we had to do that. Well you didnt have to do that. You could have made the phone thicker. So that would be mine. Make the phone a bit thicker and give us a longer battery. The phone battery is going to degrade after youve had it for a year or two; youre going to get dramatically less life out of the same battery. So we should design the phone to have maybe 150% more battery than you need so that a year from now when the capacity has shrunk, its still functioning. (Zack) Yeah, and theresso it will last more charge cycles because theres more life in there. (Kyle) Exactly. And we see that with the ipads. Like an ipad has a battery that nobody really burns through an ipad battery in a day, right? It takes a couple days to work through it. And so its not until youve had an ipad for three or four years that you really need to change the battery. Where a phone, you need to swap the battery every year. So if were in this constraint where were saying we have the phones we have now, I would like to see a battery thats easy to swap. So my ideal phone, like my favorite phone out there on the market right now is the Fairphone. And unfortunately I cant use one myself because it only works on the European frequencies right now. So Im hoping that the Fairphone 3 comes to the US. But its designed so you dont need any tools to swap the battery. You dont even need any tools to swap the screen, its just plastic tabs and it comes out. (Zack) Perfect. And its cuz that phones pretty modular right? (Kyle) Its designed to be extremely modular for reparability, not modular for functionality. So you cant swap out a better camera on it, but it is easy when a camera fails to swap it out. (Zack) So just put in the same component again? Thats good. So just to summarize, the ideal phone for the iFixit CEO would be a phone that has a rigid case on it, so like it wont bend or damage easily. And a bigger battery than what is in most flagships. (Kyle) And a battery that you can swap yourself. And then the other things I would say is that it should have a repair manual thats publicly available. And there should be parts available. And whats crazy is that the Fairphone is the only phone in the world that has a repair manual and parts available from the manufacturer. None of the other companies do it. Even the Indian Smartphone companies. Even Samsung, Apple, HTC, Huaweinone of them are making repair information available. Its crazy. So you and I have to figure it out instead of everybody else. And I dont understand. I think its the most consumer hostile market. You go and you look at power toolslike you came from construction right? Every single power tool company has repair information available and parts. You get a Makita and you get a DeWalt, and you need a new clutch for your drill and they will sell it to you because if they dont, the words going to get out in the construction community right? If DeWalt stops selling repair parts, no one will buy DeWalts anymore. (Zack) Exactly. (Kyle) So how do they get away with this in the Smartphone world? I dont understand. (Zack) I dont know, but its good for us as the two largest cell phone repair channels on YouTube. (Kyle) Theyre going to keep making these fragile things made out of glass right? You got Samsungs got glass on the front and the back, yeah. So as long as everybody is out there making very fragile devices that are thin, were going to keep teaching you how to swap the batteries, how to fix the glass, how to fix the lenses on the camerasyeah. Its a target rich environment for people that are looking to teach people how to fix their broken stuff. (Zack) Well good. Well now we know what the ideal Smartphone is for the CEO of iFixit. I agree 100% even MKBHD mentioned something about having a thicker battery in his phones. So I think, you know, from a consumer standpoint, having a bigger battery is just better all around. (Kyle) Its time to end this design anorexia; making things thinner and thinner and thinner to the point where you cant even play Pokmon on your phone. (Zack) Exactly. If you cant play Pokmon Go on your phone, theres no point in even having a phone. (Kyle) Theres no point in even living, right? I mean, really. This is what weve come to. What level are you at? (Zack) I havent downloaded it yet. (Kyle) Youve got to get going! (Zack) Im working on it. After this, Ill do it. Well thanks for having me here at the studio of iFixit. Ive really enjoyed this time. If you havent subscribed to their channel yet, iFixit, they have fantastic repair guides; even pictures and a blog format. It is fantastic. (Kyle) Our goal is to teach people how to fix everything that they have. (Zack) There we go. Thanks for watching!",

    "transcript": "- So some of you guys might know that my birthday is on March 20th and there's also very, very, very exciting game that is coming out on March 20th, Sea of Thieves! Jenna and I had so much fun, we were playing the beta and every time I would leave to go get a snack or walk the dog, I would come back, I would be in the brig and the ship would be full of water and I'd be drowning, playing my freaking accordion, waiting for my friends and nobody would let me out. But all of that aside, I am freaking out right now because behind me, Microsoft and Rare surprised me with a birthday cake and I am absolutely freaking out. And Jenna was the secret ingredient to making it all happen. - I was the party planner, I helped out decorating it. No, not decorating it, just planning, planning it. I'm very excited because I think it turned out just how I imagined. - [Justine] Oh, my gosh. - [Jenna] It looks really good. - I have only peeked very very quickly inside of it and I'm freaking out so I'm gonna do an unboxing of my birthday cake, right? Is this the first unboxing of a birthday cake? - I was gonna say, have you ever unboxed a cake before? - [Justine] Nope. What knife will I use? Hold on! - [Jenna] Give us a sword. - Delicious Arts made this cake and they are so talented, like I'm actually in shock, I can't even believe this. So the instructions they gave me were to cut here. - [Jenna] Did they tell you that? - Did they tell me? That's what they said, right? Or is there a different side? I'm not sure, oh gosh, well let's just find out. The problem is this knife is actually not that small. - [Jenna] Did you cut the cake? What if you cut the ship? - Oh boy. (cardboard slicing) I can't wait for you guys to see this. You're gonna be in shock. - [Jenna] Wow. - Wow, wow, wow, wow! Hold up, hold up, this is, this is the exact ship from the game. (gasps) - [Jenna] Whoa, lady, watch where you put that knife. - Oh, oops, so sorry. - [Jenna] My god. - What? This is the exact ship. There's the mug where you can drink the beers. There's a little treasure chest, and there's me in the brig! Is that me? - [Jenna] That's you. - That is me, I was like that's not a character in the game, but it should be. - [Jenna] That's you. - (gasps) I'm wearing black lipstick and it looks really good on me. I should think about it. Happy Birthday, Aye Justine. Do you guys get it? Aye, matey. (knife slicing cardboard) Jenna, thank you so much for facilitating this. - I would also just like to say that, normally they said that they needed six to eight weeks and I gave them less than a week. They did an awesome job. - This looks exactly like the ship from the game, it really is. There's sharks in the water. Of course a little Sea of Thieves logo, is this edible? What's not edible on here? - [Jenna] There was a few things that weren't edible, I have to read it, like four things, figures. - I think this is probably not edible, that looks like a piece of wood. The bananas! Oh! - This is all rice crispy and chocolate and fondant and then this is actual cake. - Thank you Jenna, thank you Microsoft, thank you Rare. You better believe you're gonna be finding me out on the high seas. What're you doing in here? - Hi, so the 100 thieves were in the playoff hunt and so we need a couple teams to lose or win today so I'm watching the matching. - This is all about Sea of Thieves today, buddy. - Happy almost birthday. - Thank you! Now it's time to get some slo-mo close-up shots of this thing, it looks so amazing. (slow sea shanty music) (women clamoring) - The Pirates are here! - The Pirates? - It's a pirate band. - Oh yeah, you did say that. (people chattering) - Pirates, pirates are here! Do I fit in now? - Oh wow, they're real pirates. - They're the ones that play at Disney. - [Woman] Really? - Yes, they're like professional pirate band. - Wow. - Oh, my god. - Hi, Cookie! Okay, there are so many dogs here and it's kinda crazy because now officially, we all have dogs. - Newest addition, little baby Scarborough. - [Justine] He's so sweet! - Look at this little man! - [Justine] I know! - He is so cute, I can't. - [Justine] So sweet. - I just can't even. - [Justine] And Luna. - Oh, we got Luna for sure. - Where's George? - [Woman] George is over here. - Look at him, he's so cute, oh my gosh! - And Ava and Jessica, I haven't seen you forever! And Joy, hello! - Hi! - [Woman] Spin, good girl. I'm sorry I don't have anything for you. - Can you believe that all of us have dogs now? Lily was the last to join. (women raving) the day after, we all met up, we had lunch, and Cassey's like, I would never get a dog, two days later. - I text you, I'm next guys, dog, is this okay? - I found the most adorable pup, I'm in love and I was like, yes! - And then the text is like 120 things long, and then you came back from a long day of whatever, you're like, what happened? And then you screenshot, and it was like, this happened. - This, in one shot. - Look how many friends you have to play with when you get your shots. Mommy, I'm scared right now. (women coo) - It's a lot, it's overwhelming. - It is a lot, oh my gosh, I'm falling over. Matty, you're heavy. (women chattering) (fiddle tune) - He doesn't like music. (dog barks) (percussive strumming) (sea shanty) - This is so amazing, can you believe it? - This is great, I love it. - [Justine] Aah! - Justine, you are extra and I love it. (singing sea shanty) - Should I? - [Girl] Yeah. - Should I? - [Girl] Go, go, go. (crowd cheers) (laughter and cheers) - She's looking at the pizza, like ooh. - Did you see that? He just hopped on my lap. - This is awesome. (chuckles) (playing gentle tune) (\"10,000 Miles Away\" by The Skullduggers) I'm taking a trip on a government ship 10,000 miles away So blow ye winds and blow And a roving I will go I'll stay no more on this old shore (people clamoring) - [Justine] 24 years old today, happy birthday to me. Happy birthday, dear Justine - [Man] Your name's hard to sing. Happy birthday to you (claps and whoops) - Okay. - [Man] Yay! I do not want to do this. - [Man] Sink the ship! Okay. - [Man] Do it. Oh, it's listing. - [Woman] To be fair, it's rice crispies. - [Man] Iceberg ahead! (laughter) - Maybe I should sharpen my knife a little more. (guests shouting and chatting) Okay, I'm just, I'm gonna start sawing. - [Man] Let the knife do the work. (man laughs) Yeah, this is good. - This is so sad. - [Man] It's coming down. - [Guests] Aah! - [Man] That looks great. - Wow, now we can, no! Eat it! - [Man] Oh, my thumb went overboard. - Should I take this off? This is so heavy. - [Woman] You can keep it! Happy birthday to you (cheers and claps) - Yay, so much cake. - [Woman] Why don't you just take the whole thing? Take the whole brig. (brig cracks) - [Crowd] Oh! - [Woman] Is it pretzel? Eat it! - Oh my god, it is, this is edible. Anybody wan--oh no! Anybody want some brig? - [Man] Yo, it's like Pocky. - Okay, I'm gonna get, I'm wearing, I'm gonna start wearing black lipstick now cause this looks really good. - [Man] You've never looked better. I'll take that tidal wave. (guests chatter) - Do you think it's gonna be good? - That has a smell. - [Man] Gotta go in the mouth. - [Justine] Maybe just give it a quick burn. - [Man] Light just the sail. - Maybe just one? - [Justine] Yeah, we just do the sail. It's not edible. - [Man] It is edible. - [Young Guy] He ate it. - [Woman] Oh, that stinks. - [Man] It's a boat fire. - [Justine] What do we do now? (guest joke and comment) There's a lot of commentary, I gotta get over here. - [Young Guy] It's like marshmallows. - [Justine] So, it's pretty warm. (overlapping comments) This was a good time, I like burning. (bell ringing) (guests chatter and laugh) Matty, are you sad all your friends are leaving you? - [Woman] He's like, no I just want everyone to leave. (both giggle) - [Justine] He's like, I wanna go to bed. (glass shatters) Come here real quick, let's take a look what's inside here. So, Susie bought me this, Susie's amazing, so she also bought me this drone balloon. This is a balloon drone. Balloon animals? No, no, no, drone balloon. - [Man] Look at its tongue. - It's so cool, and then she also got me this. This is a pineapple and inside of it, instead of candy, cause I was like, aah, I gotta stop eating so much candy, (rattling) there's Lego inside of the pinata! - Happy birthday. (taps chair) (Legos shaking) - There are so many in here. Oh my gosh, a wheel, wheel. - [Man] It looks like some kind of a Friends helicopter. - You know what I think it is? I think it's the Friends food truck. - [Man] Why would a food truck have propellers? - Oh, I gotta say bye to Raul. - Oh, I know what it is, it's the pick-a-brick wall. (Legos rattling) (slinky pirate music)",

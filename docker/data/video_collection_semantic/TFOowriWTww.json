    "transcript": "- Memes, Memes. Hey, guys. What was the first meme? Now, most of you have grown up in this golden age of memes, unless you're old like Matt. Jimmy had to explain to him what a dead meme was. Well, every generation likes to believe that they invented something 'cause they're such a special snowflake. What it really comes down to with memes is formatting. A lot of memes are just captions on an image, and let's be honest there is nothing inherently unique about the idea of captions on an image. Political cartoons have been around for centuries. They were especially popular in Britain and France during the 1800s. Peanuts, Garfield and Marmaduke have all been staples of the cartoon section for decades. Even caption contests such as the one in the New York Times have been running for almost 100 years. However, all the way back in 1921, the University of Iowa satire magazine \"The Judge\" which is a great name for a satire magazine, printed what has the potential to be the first meme. A witty caption, check, a dopey image, also check. So we got a meme, right? Well, no. Not according to Richard Dawkins. Why is he the meme authority? (laughs) - [Matt] He invented the word. - Oh, he actually invented the word proper. - [Matt] Yeah. - Oh, that makes sense. - [Matt] He is the meme lord. - Wow! The word meme is pronounced meme, not me-me because I guess some people say that, was first used in 1976 in Dawkins' book, The Selfish Gene. I actually learnt that thanks to PewDiePie's meme review. Thanks, Elon Tesla. (loud explosion) (scream) By Dawkins definition a single image can not be a meme. Instead memes are, \"Culturally transmitted entities that spread from person to person such as hearing a song that gets stuck in your head.\" The meme goes through variations and mutations as it spreads. Is that what's called going viral? Is this actually... Is that actually it though? It makes sense, right? Because a meme starts out as something that's kinda funny and then people will recognize that, change it, and then it sort of mutates into something else which is then funny only because you recognize the first thing and then it continues to get memer and more mutated. I, now understand memes. Thanks Matt. As the name of the book implies he compares these memes to genes, you know like DNA and only the most culturally dominant carry on. Now if that's sounds familiar, it's the exact same theory as Charles Darwin's Survival of the Fittest. That is until PewDiePie used them at which point they're artificially dead. - [Matt] Does that mean if PewDiePie reviews me I'd be dead? (whimsical music) - Yes. Well, the book itself has nothing to do dank memes on the internet, it's actually about boring stuff like biology and altruism, but it's message remains relevant. The best memes get spread to the most people. However when most people think about memes, you don't think about some old school thing, you wanna know about what was the first internet meme. In 1986, 3D animator Michael Girard and his company Unreal Pictures, were contracted to develop a program for animating 3D CGI characters. They built a skeleton that could be loaded unto a number of different characters. In the skeleton rigging we control the character's movements. And this step is very standard these days, but it was pretty revolutionary back in 1996. Around that same time another contractor, ViewPoint Data Labs, built a number of different character skins for the program. Some of these skins included a clown, a dinosaur, and everyone's favorite, a baby in a diaper. (baby crying) The program shipped out to customers with a number of demos preloaded including one doing a complex cha-cha dance. Eventually the program landed with a developer at LucasArts, Ron Lussier. Lussier turned the dancing baby into a gif and yes, that's how it, don't at me. And emailed it out to some of his friends. You know how it goes? They tell two friends, who tell two more friends, and before you know it, it was a viral sensation. At one point dancingbaby.net experienced so much web traffic they need to revert to text only web page. Which kind of defeats the purpose. Girard believes the big reason why it was so popular is because of how unsettling it was. The chubby little baby was sitting just outside the uncanny valley where something looks almost human, but not quite, and people were sharing the gif not because they thought it was cool, but because they thought it was hilariously creepy. - [Matt] Like Momo? - Yee! That's a dead meme, man. Despite its massive popularity in the 90s Girard is not a fan of the dancing baby, and has gone on record to say he 100% regrets creating it. Apparently the writers of Ally McBeal were big fans. In the show Ally and the baby are dancing together to the music of I gotta a feeling (coughs) The music got added to the original animation and that became the most popular animation of the meme. Josh, you can cut that part out, right? - [Matt] Before we get demonitized immediately. (snapping fingers) - Memes have changed a lot since the dancing baby gif. In the early to mid 2000s memes started to be a little more relatable in a global sense. Think of stuff like the success baby, or the awkward penguin, Like a boss, or things that make you cringe like the Delta safety videos from a a couple of years ago. (goat bleats) Nowadays the shelf life of a meme is short because they are mostly reactive to something the people are talking about during the time that they're actually relevant. Their relatability lasts about as long as the source captures the internet's mind. Elon Musk thinks that the dead deer at the bottom of a pool is funnier after he finds out it's a real picture? Meme. Will Smith's genie looks like it was created using an Nintendo 64. Meme! Everyone on Instagram started getting ads for free to play mobile games about being in the mafia. Well, that's how mafia works. If you want to see how mafia actually works, we've done an entire this is episode all about that which you guys can check out. We hope you enjoy this one all about the first me-me. Make sure to like the video, subscribe and all that kind of fun stuff. Otherwise, memes will happen. What is that? Oh, no. What is... Is this the... Is that the reverse of the... Okay. All right. Whatcha gonna call that? That's enough. Thank you very much. We're just kind of...That's it. (whimsical music)",

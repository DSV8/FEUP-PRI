    "transcript": "- Bout to charge an iPhone with some fire. Don't play with fire Only you can prevent wildfires Fire! - [Voiceover] So what's up, guys? Jonathan here and this is the FlameStower which will use fire to charge your electronics. Whether it's a camera, external battery, or in this case, a phone, where I'm using the iPhone 6s plus to test it out. It's a fairly simple design, which is geared to be both lightweight and portable, which in turn will minimize the bulk you're bringing with you. And the idea here is maybe you're on a camping trip your external battery died, or a bear ate it. Now, you're able to generate a charge without relying on electricity or potentially even solar power because those clouds come out, the sun goes down, you're screwed. Now this is geared to work with multiple types of heat, whether it's the stove in your kitchen, a portable camp stove, or in this case, a fire, which now that we have going, let's see if it actually works - And it looks like we are in business. The little LED indicator has lit green, which means we should be ready for a charge. What's happening here is the blade is hot enough where its transferring the thermal energy to the generator. That's working in unison with the reservoir filled with water and the opposing temperatures are actually what is creating that charge, which should hopefully work right now. Plug in the USB cable. It is hot down here. Kids, be safe with fire. It works! It works! It works! - [Voiceover] Now this is not going to output a fast charge whatsoever. It's supposed to be equivalent to charging your device on a laptop. But again, the idea here is if you're going camping you're gonna be there for a while, and you're probably not in a rush. So for fun, let's see how much of a charge we can generate while making some s'mores. - No, man, haven't you ever watched The Sandlot? First, take the graham, then you stick the chocolate on the graham, then you flame the mallow. - Ah, Austin thought it was right. \"Oh, you're gonna stick the chocolate in the fire?\" Take it out! - There you go. Blow on it. (loudly puffing) Dude, you gotta get the melty insides! - That is the melty insides, man. - How to not make a s'more with Austin Evans. - Austin, you're gonna chew like a mother. - On your marks, get set, go! - Bon appetit! - I think Austin's gonna win this one, man. You done? - Ahhhh! - Ralphy wins. - Ah, got it. - More importantly, - Never open your mouth like that again, Austin. - Now we gotta see if there was any charge to the phone. (bleep) there was no charge. (slowed-down laughing) Quick update, we've jumped up 1% And this is not going to be intended for a fast-charging device. The fact that it works at all with fire is kind of awesome. And really, the idea here is that you're gonna be out there for a long time making chili, making s'mores, - Making Colin Moriarty. - Making Colin Moriarty. And while you're out there for a long time, your phone is slowly, but surely getting some juice. So, in cases where maybe your battery pack is dead, you went for a long camping trip, you're out there for two, three, four, five, six maybe seven days, the fact that you can actually juice up, and it's not going to be limited to just your iPhone, it's gonna work with any phone, any camera, GoPro, you name it, this thing works. It's not fast, but it's awesome. Aside from that, thank you guys for watching. If you want to see some more awesome iPhone accessories, check out the link below. Hopefully you enjoyed it, and if you did, and you are feeling like being awesome, make sure to go - You're killing me, smalls. - On that like button. This is Jonathan, and marshmallows in his mouth, Ralphy and I will catch you guys later. (beep) For filling three quarters of the way right now,",

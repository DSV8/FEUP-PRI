    "description": "Been a long time coming. Today it's here:    I am partnering with @NetworkChuck to create thisisIT, a collaborative effort to create FREE IT training content on YouTube. We will be working together to create FULL IT training courses on YouTube.   If  you'd like to partner with us on this mission, consider joining the thisisIT membership:   #thisisIT  #davidbombal #networkchuck",

    "transcript": "(keyboard clacks) - Now it's taken me a long time to get to this point. I've been doing a bunch of things in the background, but hopefully what I'm gonna tell you about today is gonna be good news. I'm gonna be offering you three paths, or three ways to get certified. (upbeat music) Now It's really amazing how quickly time flies by. I recorded that video over three months ago. Time just flies. You need to make the most of your time. But there are some reasons that I didn't publish that video, including this. - I legit quit my job. Yeah, I quit my job and it's not like a part time job or some silly job I have on the side. No, I quit my main, full time, primary source of income. I quit, on Friday. - So the three paths that I'm talking about are, free content on YouTube, free courses on YouTube, low cost courses on platforms such as Udemy. As well as membership programs. So I've known Chuck for quite a while now. We've actually collaborated and worked together on various things, such as YouTube videos. - So you two are invited to Cisco HQ, part of Cisco Champions just the tech day. Where a bunch of tech influencers came here, got some deep dives, which was really fantastic. - Oh Yeah - Alongside of that, You guys both have really fantastic YouTube channels about technology. - Thanks. - Can you tell us more about your individual YouTube channels. (upbeat music) - Hey guys, welcome back to \"This is IT.\" - But we've now decided to take this to the next level. So rather than me trying to reach these goals by myself, it makes sense for me to work or collaborate with Network Chuck. He's an amazing creator. His content is fantastic just have a look at the new CCNA course that he's launched, amazing quality. - [Announcer] This, is day zero of my free CCNA course and a huge shout out to Boson software were the official sponsor of this CCNA course, - Chuck is an amazing creator and it's fantastic to be able to work with him. I found it really funny to read some of the comments on Reddit, about people complaining when he launched a free CCNA course. He's launching a free course and people are complaining very, very strange. But, what was also funny is that people were saying that he should be more like me. That's the worst thing that he could do. He needs to be himself and I need to be myself. People say, David, you should grow a beard. David, you should be like this, or that, or the other. I need to be myself. I will be the best person if I just be myself and he needs to be himself. But the advantage of collaboration is that, him and I collaborating bring the strengths that he has and the strengths that I have together and allows us to go much, much further. There's actually this rule in life where one plus one doesn't equal two. One plus one can equal 10. In other words, there's an exponential gain by working together. And I'm really hoping that Chuck and my collaboration will do that. Not only for us, but also for you. You'll get better content on YouTube. You'll get better content on Udemy. You'll get better content and better benefits as part of this membership program. I really hope that our collaboration will bring huge value to you and help you in your career, help you in your life. We all have limited time. I'm a lot older than many others in this industry. And let me tell you, time is short and it goes really quickly. You need to make the most of your time. I keep saying that I'm like this broken record. I keep saying that I'm like this broken record. That just repeats that. But it's really, really true. And I believe that collaborating with Network Chuck will allow me to have a bigger impact on the world rather than just trying to do it myself. I already have over 450 thousand students on Udemy. Udemy is a fantastic platform. Has allowed me to help many, many people. And I wanna thank those of you who have purchased my courses on Udemy. You've changed my life and hopefully I've helped change your life, but I wanna take this to the next level by creating free content on YouTube. And I'm really happy to announce that I'm going to be releasing my CCNA course for free on YouTube. So if you can't afford ten dollars on Udemy, or you can't afford to be part of our membership program, you'll get access to my CCNA course for free. I'm gonna be publishing one video a week, on YouTube. But in addition, I'm gonna be collaborating with Network Chuck. I'm gonna be using some of his content. He's gonna be using some of my content. We're gonna try and make our CCNA courses, the best CCNA courses on the planet. And hopefully we'll be able to accomplish that goal, but not just CCNA. We wanna create a whole bunch of other content. We wanna create a whole bunch of other courses. I really wanna teach you everything that I know, to help you become better in your career, help you get further in life. There's no better feeling than getting messages, from people who tell me how I've changed their lives, through the content that I've created. That is an amazing feeling. To be able to give people the opportunity to change their lives, in the same way that my life was changed through technology. My life was changed dramatically. When I became a CCNA. My life changed dramatically. When I started learning technical content and you can do the same. You can also help us, help other people by supporting us in this mission. So please have a look at our membership site, thisisit.io. And see if you, can help support this mission of helping more people. You can change your life through studying. You can change your life through certifications in the same way that I did. So I'm really hoping that this new membership program that Chuck and I have created will help you, but will help many, many other people as well. I'm David Bombal. And I really want to thank you for your support over the years. Thank you for buying my courses. Thank you for watching my videos on YouTube. Thank you for interacting with me on social media. I wanna wish you all the the very best. (upbeat music)",

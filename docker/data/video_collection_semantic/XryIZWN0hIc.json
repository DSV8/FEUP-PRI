    "transcript": "well it's finally here we can finally talk about Ryzen 3rd gen threadripper performance and honestly guys of all the launches this year this is by far the most exciting now the other processors from AMD are pretty amazing the Ryzen 3950X which was launched less than 2 weeks ago is an amazing processor I mean I'm thinking of putting that into my eye TX workstation PC so definitely stay tuned for that in fact if you are interested in our full review of that CPU you can check it out right over here but these two CPUs the threadRipper 3960x and threaderipper 3970x are pretty important processors as well because it is an amazing solution for creators like myself and Dimitri now that he is kind of slowly getting over the fact that his 2950X water-cooled build is out of date and pretty slow because threadripper 3 is fast like really fast now we've already seen the impressive performance improvement between second and 3rd generation Ryzen processors and now those are being rolled into high core count threadripper for CPUs not only that but with the Zen 2 architecture and a bunch of other changes aimed I set out to fix some performance issues we had with their previous 24 and 32 core WX series and imagine when Indy rolls this out things could get absolutely bonkers guys but that's another video for another day and after that little tease let's move on wanna step up your air flow game look no further than the master fan SF 120 M from Coolermaster featuring a damping frame designed to ensure stability a connected fan lane design for optimal cooling performance and an anti vibration motor that ensures better acoustics it's very simple to install and it comes with three fan speed controls check it out down below now I'm gonna kick things off by making things a little bit easier for you guys so make sure to check the comments section down below where we'll pin the timestamps because this is going to be a long video because of some additional testing that we have to do for these processors I'm sure you're familiar with these specs of these processors but if you're not here they are with 32 cores and 64 threads the 3970X will be the flagship of AMD's desktop lineup until the 64 core 3990X launches next year it'll go for $2000 and it'll replace the 2990WX which had the same number of course the 396 X has 24 cores and will be available for $1,400 which is still a good 400 dollars more than the intel's top-end cascade Lake X 10 9 8 exc but that CPU isn't even in the same class aim DS current risin lineup is pretty full but you can see it actually makes a lot of sense the threadripper 3970X and 3960X are focused on professionals who tackled massively parallel workloads and need to save as much as time as possible meanwhile the second-generation threadripper processors and the X399 motherboards will stick around but at lower price points that means the X399 platform will stick around for early adopters who now want to upgrade and still need threadripper for its memory bandwidth and massive number of processing threads and PCI lanes under that comes all of the regular Rison processors from the rise 9 all the way down to recently launched Athlon 3000 G but what about Intel well handy is hitting them where it hurts the most these threaderipper cpu's are being launched like nuclear missile at high-priced cpus like these xeon w 3275 that thing will run you over 3 grand so while the new threader / processors might look expensive they're actually lower priced than the competition I also mentioned that AMD loaded a bunch of improvements into this version of thread upper and those are what I'm excited about you see the 2970 WX and the 2990 WX faced some serious issues with Windows due to their unique chip led design and memory layout also AMD's c PPC which optimized frequencies for different load patterns was broken until Microsoft released updates so what is AMD doing now well first of all they worked with Microsoft to build what's called CBBC - so the OS is more aware of Zen to stop ology and it can react accordingly that should mean higher clock speeds sustained over a longer period of time and much better performance in many workloads AMD has also modified their architectures so all the individual CPU diets can equal access to the DRAM and PCI bandwidth they're hoping this will lead to less problems in programs that had issues recognizing how previous gen architecture handled memory requests speaking of memory the controllers have been completely revised so third gen threader / CPUs will support higher maximum memory speeds and increased capacities for example AMD says their sweet spot is 36 hundred megahertz with 64 gigabytes and 32 hundred megahertz on a hundred twenty eight gigabyte kit that's a big improvement over the previous gen which sometimes struggled to hit three thousand megahertz with 64 gigabytes installed another thing that should be brought up is an AMD technically supports ECC memory but it is ultimately up to motherboard manufacturers to implement it now this could be another messy situation again since a few times X299 and boards did support ECC memory but it had to be pulled back later on with BIOS updates asked for those motherboards well things are gonna be interesting these new threaderipper CPU's require a new TRX4 socket and TRX40 motherboards and those won't be cheap but also take note that your old tr4 coolers will be compatible with the mount provided they support 250 watt CPUs this MSI TRX40 Creator will be listed for about seven hundred US dollars and that isn't even their highest end model another example is the Asus zenith 2 extreme which were told will hit store shelves for 850 dollars $850 motherboard my friends you can build a PC for that price I said it I just said that now this extreme pricing does come attached to some amazing capabilities and to explain those I'm gonna take a quick segment from our previous video to help explain this portion there's 40 PCI 4.0 lanes dedicated to adding cards and eight to the chipset link add to that 2 sets of configurable ports that can each be set to deliver either form or PCI lanes for Gen 4 and Mimi lanes or for SATA outputs then there's also a hub for 4 USB 3.2 Gen 2 connections the TRX40 chipset comes into this with another 8 gen 2 ports USB 3.0 connections SATA 6 gigabits per second and another a general pci 4.0 lanes that can be used for other devices finally there are two more flexible hubs that can either accommodate PCI capacity or SATA 6 so how does that all translate into an actual motherboard well looking over the msi TRX40 creator and it is just nuts for people who need a lot of fast storage and a lot of capability that comes from all of those pci lanes basically there are three PCI Gen 4 and a two slots on the motherboard and another four on an add-in card that looks like this this isn't even funny I mean this is an actual this looks like a graphics card except it doesn't have a OH I mean it's running off of a 6-pin connector it's got an actual fan to cool all those drives this is welcome to 2019 moving on to the zenith extreme and asus has gone about things a bit differently first of all they're using a dual 8 pin and a single 6 pin layout for the cpu input power the i/o area is also packed with additional USB 3.2 gen 2 ports and also a USB 3 point 2 2 by 2 port that provides up to 20 gigabits per second of bandwidth for external storage devices so our test systems have remained pretty much identical to the 30 and 50 X review other than the addition of the TRX40 Zeenat to extreme as it is the motherboard we're using for third gen threadRipper as usual all motherboard specific enhancements were disabled so things like multi-core enhancement for Intel are turned off starting with Cinebench and straight off these are by far the fastest to processors we've ever seen the most incredible thing about these results is that they're almost 50% faster than the 2990WX and the 2970WX AMD is absolutely dominating our cinnabench charts guys and it doesn't stop here blender just continues with third gen thread upper whipping up pretty much every other CPU we have on hand I mean the 3960X is hands-down beating the 2990WX even though it has a lot less processing threads meta shape is also pretty interesting since it uses both multi-core and also lightly threaded workloads depending upon the task that's why the threadripper CPUs don't perform quite as well when compared to purely multi-threaded situations but to be honest there versus previous gen CPUs is massive in reality capture you can clearly see where the WX series CPU's is just straight-up failed to play nice with the windows ecosystem these new processors are very different but at least for this program there are far better options out there for less money so after a few disappointing results we're back to absolute domination seeing this test finished in under ten minutes is just well pretty nuts moving on to handbrake here we are with a Transco job and yep say hello to threadripper leading again now this lead isn't all that massive simply because handbrake isn't fully able to load all course now we've come to the part that's pretty important for us premiere and resolve results starting with Adobe Premiere Pro the 3970X and the 3960X provides huge performance uplifts versus zwx series and they're the fastest things in our charts guys but their numbers are still comparable to what the I9 9900K can achieve with the IGP enabled to accelerate rendering performance but I do want to make something very clear the input is based on what we're shooting with so mp4 files if you're using a different format like red raw like our 3d the numbers might be a little different now this is a new test for us where we take 174 a raw video project files and transcode them from mp4 to pro res with Adobe Media encoder seeing how fast this is actually makes me want to use the third and semi X to transcode all our footage from here on out it's really that fast another thing that was odd in this test was neither WX processor was able to complete the task it happened multiple times and no matter what we did it would just freeze the system moving on to our DaVinci Resolve test we need it to be very honest here it's possible that our overclocked r-tx 20 and 80 I became a bottleneck for the fastest CPUs on this chart we noticed the GPU was pegged at a hundred percent utilization while some course on the 3950X the i9 10980XE and the new threaded per CPU remained idle we're gonna have to look into this a bit closer but it goes to show how bloody fast these things are the last real-world test is a render in Autodesk Maya and this is what absolute domination looks like folks there's no other way to describe it and now it's time to take a look at gaming performance now before you start raging in the comments I'm completely aware that these processors are not meant for that task but it'll be interesting to see what kind of performance improvements AMD has implemented with these new processors so starting things off and we immediately have a problem far cry 5 has some scheduling issues with the new threadripper CPUs but let me tell you this was the only issue we encountered through testing luckily enabling game mode and the BIOS improved things by quite a lot moving on and it looks like ambi really did improve gaming performance along with everything else while neither of these thread repair processors lead the charts their performance is more than decent and a huge improvement over the previous generation and actually just thought of a marketing point for AMD threadripper finish your work faster more time for gaming now at this point do we really care about power consumption I mean if you really do here you go and yes we ran these tests multiple times and the results were always the same our 3970x and 3960X actually consumes only a bit more power than the WX series processors despite kicking their butts across every benchmark this also shows how far AMD is ahead of Intel they're offering 50% better performance in some apps with only about 20% higher power consumption the new Hydra X series from Corsair is a full water cooling ecosystem with transparent blocks for RGB goodness and built-in flow indicators with soft and heart to being available and the full array of fittings so you can design the perfect loop for you hide your X by Corsair everything's linked below alright so I think I'm gonna wrap this up quickly because the benchmarks have conveyed the whole story what AMD has been able to accomplish over these last three years is just staggering and third-generation Rison therapure feels like a combination of every improvement rolled into one incredible family of processors but there is one negative and that is platform cost sure in the grand scheme of things the 3960X and the 3970X are affordable compared to Intel's alternatives but AMD is pushing the CPUs way past their second gen prices the motherboards are also seeing pretty big price hikes but in the right hands and in the right situations the investments will absolutely positively worth every penny time is money for professionals so if you spend a few thousand bucks and if you end up saving a few hours of running times over the course of a week that could ultimately become an advantage for someone like you know a content creator or even doesn't every content creator it could be a professional who works with Autodesk or you know other rendering programs but at this time I'm gonna ask for another opinion from someone who has been in industry for a long time and that is none other than Michael Michael come on in I actually I actually had an emotional response when when benchmarking this thing because I've been in this for a good 14 years now and it's the largest generational increase I've ever seen it's not your typical 10% 5% and I also needed to think to myself is that just because the WX series didn't perform up to my expectations but then you look back and you look at this versus Intel and you look at it versus some of the other Ryzen processors and it's unbelievable it used to be that AMD had to rely on core counts in order to beat int'l but now they have frequencies Kork ounce and IPC and they're just demolishing everything in their path so for me this is the processor that is the icing on the cake for AMD in their last three years is the culmination of all their hard work and man it's freaking amazing I know right if they say if they say then then three is coming out next year its Intel's gonna be in a little bit of hurt until 7 nanometre I'm gonna conclude this like like Eber usually does I'm Mike with Hardwick Canucks I'm not going to be as deep and monotone as him but there's other videos here that you can check out you can subscribe over here boot sequence our other channels some are down here and I'm out of here I hope you saw my hands we will the cameraman says bye",

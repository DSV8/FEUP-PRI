    "transcript": "- [Krazy Ken] I'm getting like, two frames per second of performance on here. Well that sucks. Kabini graphics, maybe that was our problem. You can use software to install apps, like these. I don't see nothing! - [Fisherman] There we go. - [Krazy Ken] Doh, dude, you're gonna kill yourself with that harpoon. Original naming scheme, as you can see, 1, 1 2 1. 1 2 2 1. (sonar beeping) (uplifting music) Hey guys, how you all doing? Really, that's just great. You know what, I'm doing pretty great today too, because we have another ThinkPad here with us. This one, I'm actually really happy with how it turned out. It's nice and clean. I gave it a little bit of a spit shine. Little bit of a, you know, (spray hissing) blow job, and everything is great. And, it's not missing a key, and it's not missing logos, kinda like the other one was. I actually do have a whole stack of these that I've been experimenting with lately. So today, we're gonna be working with this one. There's no OS on it, so hmm. What? Very popular version of Linux recently got an update. Hmm, oh I know! Ubuntu 18.10, of course! And look at that. Look at those little animated bubbles. Those are so cool. All right, Cosmic Cuttlefish guys. Right now, as it stands, 18.04 is the long-term support release. However, we're gonna update to the latest version, to have some fun. We'll take a look at some of the new features, and I hear, there's a new theme. Oh, and I'm all about that stuff. We'll install it, test drive it, and see how well it performs on that Lenovo. Let's get started. First, we must make an image. Well, we have an image, we just need to image it to this mega awesome flash drive here. So we'll just (popping) pop that inside. Wait for it to mount. Someone on Twitter was actually asking me recently, what is my preferred program for doing imaging. Honestly, for a free, open-source, piece of software, Etcher does the trick. I've used it before. It is fabulous, and it's not mounting, great. Oh, you know why? I bet, it's because I was using it for something else, and it's not formatted right. Yes, of course. Look at this very colorful popsicle stick. Doesn't look like that's gonna work. So, we'll do FAT32. We'll call it untitled, because we're original. It is erasing, formatting, and mounting. Bon appetit, we're done. Now that the drive is mounted, let's go into Etcher, and drag our image right into there. It automatically detected our flash drive already. Now, we're going to flash. And we are finishing. Validate? Oh, now we're validating okay. Just since I have the compressed air next to me, and while I'm waiting for Etcher to load, I just wanted to point out that in the directions, it does say to use, in a series of short blasts. So, for the people who are blasting me, no pun intended, for doing these short series of blasts, you can suck a duck. I was just doing what the directions say. If you wanna check out that video, where I use compressed air, to help dust out a MacBook Pro, you certainly can. It's a jolly good one. All right, back to Etcher. The disk you inserted, was not readable by this computer. On a normal day, I would crap my pants. Today, that's okay, because that's what we want. So I'm gonna take that out, and close down Etcher. Thank you Etcher. Your services are no longer required for today. Let's head over to the Lenovo ThinkPad X140e. (evil laughing) Bing! Back to the pad. All right, we got our flash drive. Let's just plug that in. Open up the butter packet. Turn it on, and spam that F12 button. (beeping) All righty, so we got the beep, that's great. The flash drive is blinking, so that means it's working. We have USB HDD Kingston. (keyboard clicking) Enter. And there we go. We already got an Ubuntu screen, that's a good start. Gonna crank that down for you. There's obviously not an IPS panel in this display (chuckling). There we are. Ubuntu! A modern version. I installed an old version recently, on my old 2001 iMac G4. That was a lot of fun. Dang it, I made the jump cut, and I missed an awesome zoom animation. The screen just zoomed in, and it was so pretty. This textured trackpad is really weird. I don't understand why some companies make their trackpad like that. It just feels like, ugh. But anyway, there's our awesome Cosmic Cuttlefish. Very beautiful. Oh, we have a nice little dissolve there, when it gets to the top of the screen. Oh, that's fabulous. I haven't used the new version of Ubuntu in awhile (chuckling). Let's try it out quick. I know we're gonna test drive after we install, but let's just use the live mode. Let's see, can I adjust this brightness? Hey, there we go. Brings me back to the days of macOS, which are still the days, today. Those little HUD elements. This trackpad is really wonky to use. Oh, that's normal. That's supposed to happen (laughing). Right? Maybe it just needs a little bit of motivation. Just needs some fresh air. There we go, we got our colorful screen back. Here we are. Now I don't want to explore too much. And again, it has been awhile since I've used a modern version of Ubuntu, so I'm not super familiar with how it normally looks, but I think we do have some new looking icons here, as part of the new theme. Wow, this trackpad is really a piece of shit (chuckling). Oh yeah, those animations are really working well. That was another thing I wanted to test on this Lenovo, was the performance. Maybe it's jut going slow 'cause it's coming off a flash drive, I don't know. But even on Zorin, it was a little clunky, but I've tested some other systems on here. They weren't as clunky. You may see those in the future. But yeah, that clunkiness is a bit of a problem. Hmm, I might have to test this on a different computer, 'cause this is really slow. I mean, I know it's gonna take awhile to load things, because of the flash drive, but I mean the animations are really slow. Let's install it and see if it works any better. Get all the drivers on here, all the updates, all the good stuff, and go from there. I have other computers I can test this on, if I need to. Wow, I hate this trackpad. I'm gonna get a mouse, screw this thing. Ha ha, I plugged in an Apple mouse. (evil laughing) Bow down before me, you plebians. We have a blank screen here. I'm not sure if that's normal, but this is already 10,000 times easier to use than that dang trackpad. Holy crap! I might as well install the third-party stuff. (mouse clicking) That must not work, because I don't have the network. (mouse clicking) Whatever, I'll do it later. No biggie. This little loading cursor looks a little bit different. Is that new, with this new theme? Because I don't remember seeing that before. Yeah, that looks a little bit different. I like it though. Erase disk and install Ubuntu, perfect. There's nothing on here anyway. I know I did get some comments, saying that I could've installed Windows 10 on here, because part of the UEFI will activate Windows, and I don't need a product key, and yada yada yada. I learned something new, and I appreciate you guys telling me stuff, because I learn a lot from this community. However, these pieces were generously donated to me, from a building that was just gonna recycle them anyway. So since I didn't really buy them, I don't wanna used a paid piece of software, without actually buying it myself. So I'm just gonna use beautiful, open-source, free stuff, yes. All right, my name. Krazy Ken, nice to meet ya'. It's already got the name of the computer in there. Okay, that's cool. User name, krazy, that's fine. We'll do, log in automatically. Password, and the copy has begun. Fast and flew of new features, the latest version of Ubuntu makes computing easier than ever. Here's just a few cool new things. I always love the colors of Ubuntu, like the magentas, and oranges and stuff. I always liked those. Oh yes, Snap Store! That's right. Normally, we have like RPMs, or deb files, for our packages, but snap packages are less dependent on dependency files. It's kind of an all-in-one, simple solution, for having all the files you need to install and run software, if I understand correctly. And that's being pushed even more with 18.10. That's cool, we may have to try out some snap packages. I am starting to notice, that a lot of operating systems are, well not just... First of all, this is cool, how everything goes opaque when you snap the window to the corner, but there's a lot of magnetization with windows inside of window managers now. I've even noticed that, on macOS. Things just kinda snap in place now. I'm not sure where that trend started, but I've been seeing it a lot lately. It probably started with Windows, because of the snap features, which really, if you wanna really dive into the origins of snap, you could say those features existed in Windows 1, even. In a way, in a very loose way. We're really splitting hairs when we think that way, though. We're now doing a various amount of other things. No we're not, we're scanning the mirror. Yes, that's my favorite part. So while this is going, my brain had a thought. Here's another laggy animation. Uh oh, I don't know whether to blame the hardware, or the software, for this. Here we go, not connected. Well let's change that. So let's network. Oh, the installation just finished right when we started on this venture. Of course it did. Well I'm not backing out now. I wanna search something before we reboot. I want to see what a real cuttlefish looks like. I think I know. Yep, that's what I was thinking. Oh, did I type in, I typed in cuddle, like the word cuddle, because I'm an idiot. I thought it was a fish that cuddled you. Yep, it's this freaky looking thing. These things are freaky looking. I really don't, ugh. Oh, that scrolling is smooth, at least. Yes, some fish are just, oh, dude, oh! Cephalopod, ugh. This looks way cuter (chuckling). All right, so that's a cuttlefish. Now that we're done with that amazing discovery, let's reboot. Actually I'm just gonna power off and remove the flash drive. Just when you think the ocean might have something nice, that just wants to cuddle you, nope, they give you a scary octopus-looking freaky thing, with a weird eye. All right, please remove the medium, then press enter. Removed (clicking), enter. There we go. (clicking) Let's boot her back up. ThinkPad There's the purple. And that's about it. Oh, it's like way up in the corner. Don't be shy, you can use the whole screen, it's okay. Oh, it's doing things, okay. Hey look, I can see my name from here. Here we go. You can use software to install apps like these. Apps like what? I don't see nothing. We will take a look at that a bit. In a bitty, bitty bit. Especially those snap packages. So let's make sure we actually have the Wi-Fi on now. Let's see, select network, and we have a nice little bin on the desktop there, for me to insert myself into later. I think I'm gonna drag it down here, because I'm a macOS rebel. The animations seem a little clunky. I think it's just, it doesn't run super-well on this particular computer, which is kind of a shame. The theme looks nice. It looks like we have some new iconography and stuff. I like the new wallpaper and everything, but the animations definitely are not working on this window (chuckling). I can just picture it. That should look really cool, but I'm getting like two frames per second, of performance on here. Well that sucks. Shit, maybe I gotta use a better computer. Yeah, I don't know, man. Even window dragging isn't very responsive. Oh, there's a full-screen kinda snap thing there. Cool. This looks cool, but I want to enjoy it on a system that's actually gonna drive it better. Again, I've used other operating systems on this PC, and the graphics ran a lot smoother. Maybe there's just a compatibility problem with this PC and this operating system. So, what do you think? We may have to switch to the experimental Mac mini. I'm gonna try it in live mode, and see if it performs better. If it does, I will do another Installation Sensation on there. I won't show you the whole thing, 'cause it's basically gonna be the same. But, I'll do the test drive on that computer, if it works faster. Uno momento (speaking in Spanish), please. Righto, we have the mini. It's just a little dusty. (spray hissing) Of course, I try to be fancy, and blow the air, or blow the dust, away. But no, doesn't do anything. I'll just use a towel, like a human. There we go. Sparkly! Hey, wow, the iPhone XR is here. I'm gonna need a new outfit. Yeah, I actually might get one. I gotta try one out first. Wow, the website really doesn't load right in this old version of Safari, does it? Anyway, let's close that out. Let's do what we're really here to do. We'll cut this disk up a little bit. Yep, apply. Original naming scheme, as you can see, 1. 1 2 1. 1 2 2 1, and 1 2 2 2. Very, very strategic. And we're done, okay. We're gonna now insert the installer, and place some bets. This computer is, I believe, two years older than the ThinkPad I shoved over there. Will it perform better with Ubuntu 18.10, or worse? Place your bets now. We'll find out the answer real soon. All right, the installer has been inserted. We'll hit, ignore. Go to the Appel menu, and we're gonna restart. Hold down the option key to go to the boot picker on startup. Here we go. (dinging) If my calculations are correct, we should have a volume show up, that says Windows, even though it's a Linux installer, it'll by default, detect it as Windows. Or not, it detected it as EFI boot. Very crafty, very, very crafty. Which one is it (chuckling)? I have no clue. I'm gonna guess. Try Ubuntu without installing, oh, OEM install. Yes, that's what other people were recommending that I do with Zorin. That is cool. I probably should of paid attention to that earlier. We're just gonna use the live mode because I want to just get a quick look at the performance. Looks great, so far. All right, here's our cuttlefish. (cracking) That was my knee. That felt great. Let's open up files. Already, that looks smoother. Just looking at the icon animation. Oh, it gets a little stuck when it goes up here, but that might be because of the snapping. But over here, I see it may be dropping one frame every so often, but that is way smoother than before. Let's take a look at this. Oh yeah. (mouse clicking) It's definitely not a perfect 60 fps, but again, I think this computer is from like 2012, using an integrated HD 4000, I believe. That's way smoother than that frickin' ThinkPad (chuckling). I think this will be a lot more enjoyable on this system. We're gonna do a re-installation sensation. Huh, I don't think I've used that before (chuckling). I guess there's a first time for everything. I'm way more confident in this Mac, in terms of the performance. Sorry Lenovo, you're kind of being pushed off to the side. Let's install. Yes, we'll do the same thing that we did before. Pretty much, except we'll use the Macintosh layouts for the keyboard, once I can find it. English, English. This is what I would like to avoid. It's actually really cool that it knows it's running Mac OS X. That's really cool (chuckling). Let's just do something else. Something else sounds fun. Okay, this will be swap area. Last time I did something similar to this, I needed one of these. I really don't know if I need it, but I'm just gonna frickin' do it (chuckling). Device for boot loader installation. Well I guess the internal hard drive would be great. Yep, we might as well do that. (mouse clicking) Chicago So they go their pin in the right place. When I use those other Linux distros it thinks Chicago's way down here. I'm like, no buddy, that's like Atlanta. Nice, it knows I'm using a Mac mini. Very cool. Very automatic, I love it. This is probably the first Installation Sensation of a Linux system, where I got through the wizard without a warning, or an error. Well, without a user-caused warning, or error, popping up (chuckling). Oh, that's sad. It's good and bad, at the same time. Good, that was pretty simple. I don't know if it's just me, but it seems like this is going faster than earlier. I could be wrong. What is time, anyway? Oh yeah, look at all that fly by. So while the Mac mini is still getting Ubuntu installed, I just wanted to confirm from earlier, yes, this Lenovo does have an AMD processor in it, along with AMD Kabini graphics. Maybe that was our problem. That doesn't sound very beefy, but this was a pretty cheap Notebook. All right, we're done. Restart now. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. It's like talking to your mother on the phone. Let's yank that out. Do, do, do, do, do, do, do. (popping) Do, do, do, do, do, do, do. Hey, I gotcha! Enter. And I guess, yeah, it's registering as EFI boot, by default. Well, isn't that fascinating. Let's do it. Oh, fascinating. Ubuntu it is. There we go, that boot screen actually looks normal. It was looking different on the Lenovo, for some reason. Oh, sexy animation. This is performing a thousand times better, already. Let's see. We got our sound, and let's check out that icon performance. Oh yeah, that is beautiful. We got a lot of built-in apps. We got utilities even. Nice animations here. Again, not 100% sure what animations are new, and which ones aren't particular to this new version of Ubuntu, but I know some of the iconography, and the overall theme, is updated for this version. Very cool looking. Let's just take a look at our system information here, to see what we're dealing with. 18.10, yes, we knew that. 3.8 gigabytes of RAM. I guess that's reading in gigabytes. I don't know anymore, ah. One's base two, one's base 10. There's all these numbers in the world. Ivy Bridge Mobile. Yes, it is an HD 4000 that's built-in with an Intel Core i5-3210M CPU quant, at 2.5 gigahertz. Now, we wanna be careful with that number right there. Technically, it's a Dual Core. It's showing up as four, because it's Hyper-Threaded. So there you go. So, noticing in the settings app here, we have a sidebar. I don't know, again, if that's recent or not. I'm sure there's people yelling at the screen right now, like, yeah, there's nothing new about that. Well, whether it's new or not, it's in this version of Ubuntu, and I like it. It's a nice little sidebar. We have our dock. This kind of reminds me of the NeXTSTEP days, the original dock that was always on the side there. Oh yeah, let's put 'em on the bottom, and shrink it down a bit. Now it feels kinda Windows 7'y. We'll just put the trash right there. We'll have our menu here. Firefox, Thunderbird, the file browser. Let's take a look. This view, icon view, we can zoom these in. Nice, pretty new icons. Definitely a flatter approach. A lot of systems seem to be going that way, with their overall theme. Things are getting flatter. Ah, we just got a beautiful push notification. And Thunderbird is ready. Push notifications. I'm guessing if I press this button, yes, we have our virtual desktops over here. So we can switch our desktops. We have all of our windows here. We can drag 'em around. We can close them from here, which is a pretty nice feature. Something that which the Mac would copy already (chuckling). We got snapping up there. I wonder if we have, oh, man, that's our calendar. That I remember being up there before. Can we snap to the side? We can snap to the side. Look at that. That is a feature I do like. We'll definitely install some software and test it out. Let's check out the worldwide webs! Let's go to my favorite website, thecomputerclan.com. There you go, looking good. Smooth scrolling. Everything looks fine. That's great. Hey, this is what you're watching right now. Mines, we always gotta play Mines. Oh shit, we're actually still surviving. I thought I would've died by now, honestly. Oh, of course, now we're dead. There you go, Snap Store, okay. It looks like this new version, is also pushing fingerprint unlock. That's good, I don't have any fingerprint devices, but maybe one day. There showing this cool infographic about snaps on the official Ubuntu website, so I guess this is a new thing that they are pushing a lot more now, in Ubuntu. Cool, well that'll be fun. We do gotta install some software on here. It says Snap Store down here. Of course they show My Little Pony stuff in the screen shot. Why wouldn't they? I feel like when I click this search button, it should do something. There it goes, it was bugging out. It wasn't showing up at the top there. I'm guessing Steam's gonna be in its own thing. Steam for Windows? Well now I'm a little confused. It says Blender right here, install. In source, see now it shows a different source here. So that's not from the Snap Store. I just ran an installation for Blender. (keyboard clicking) I'm a little confused now. This one's coming from... (mumbling in deep voice) not supported? What are you talking about Willis? Bullshit. You're not supported. All right, well fine, I'll find something else. Also, why not install Steam, get some games on here. Wait, did that just say GIMP got installed now? I thought earlier, it said it wasn't working. Whatever, make up your mind Ubuntu. 2.10! Along with this new version of Ubuntu, yes, it is using the new Linux kernel, I believe, what version is it on now? 4.18, I think. As you saw earlier, we're using GNOME, 3.30. Steam Launcher, here we go. Do, do, do, do, do. (popping) So while that's going, I gotta do what I always do, when I test this stuff out, change the wallpaper. Which I still need to submit my photos to. 'Cause I think they do photo contests, for the wallpapers, like wallpaper contests. I still haven't submitted any of those, for any Linux distro. I really should, because I think I take some decent photos, right. I'll probably put one of mine on here soon, too. Let's see what's built-in. Nothing that's really tickling my fancy. Cuttlefish are freaky. They scare the shit out of me. They look weird. All right, Steam Launcher is installed. No, you fricker. Get out of there, there we go. Steam, boom, there we go. The password, yes I'd love to continue. What other features do you like about 18.10? I mean, I'm sure there's a lot I didn't talk about, but feel free to mention them. I only covered a few things. Now I'm just kind of test driving. While Steam does that part of the install, let's go back to the Interwebs, and get a wallpaper from, I don't know, thecomputerclan.com perhaps, under the More section, and then Wallpapers. That's a thing of mine. I can only use photos that I shot, for my wallpapers. Let's see, hmm. These are all good. I used this one a few times. This is a pretty cool one. That's nostalgic, I've had this one for a long time. A lot of people like this one. Let's just do it for nostalgia's sake, huh. It's 8,000 by 4,500 in resolution. I don't know if that'll be big enough, but we will try. That brings back some memories. I haven't used this, as a wallpaper, in forever. Interesting though, I am noticing it is not resampling with a smooth bicubic algorithm. It definitely looks sharp when it resizes for the desktop. It must be using some other type of resampling method, or maybe like a nearest neighbor resample. It does look a little sharp there. Taking all those pixels and shrinking 'em down. But for the sake of our experiment today, I think I'll let is slide. Although normally, that would really piss me off. But, we can always resample the image ourselves inside of GIMP (laughing), 'cause we have that kind of power. Beautiful serif typeface. Oh cool, they put toggle switches up here, that's cool. I like that sound, that's cool. (robotic gurgling) I'll use them cool sounds. When did they get these (chuckling)? (electronic popping) Okay, I could do that for awhile. I probably shouldn't. Let's log in. A comment on your profile. July 15th, oh just a little bit late. Oh from Horny Pink Hedgehog. Hmm, wonder who that is. Let's install stuff. SteamOS and Linux, which I still need to do a SteamOS Krazy Ken episode. I really should. I've also been really wantin' to replay Half-Life 2 lately, like on a live broadcast. I know I've been saying that for a while, but I've just been waiting for the perfect time to do it. So I don't really wanna play any of that stuff, because I don't wanna spoil it. It's been a long time, and I wanna save it for the broadcast. But one thing I won't be playing on the broadcast is Lost Coast, so we can install that now. 'Cause that's like a deleted scene game, if you will. Game purchase, 2010. Wow, I purchased this stuff in 2010, wow. It was that long ago already, holy crap. I remember when I first started playing Half-Life 2. It was just unreal. I mean it wasn't unreal, like unreal, 'cause that's different, but it was a really cool experience. And I gotta do Super Hexagon, because that's like tradition. I always gotta test that when I test Steam games. And why the hell not, The Stanley Parable. I've only played 80 minutes of it (laughing). Can you tell, I don't really play a lotta games? Well, we'll let those run in the background. Now Budgie, is something I was thinking about fiddling with, sometime in the future. Hmm, I think I'd rather install Ubuntu Budgie, instead of just installing the themes on top of 18.10. But yes, do stick around for that. I'll probably do a future episode on that, yes. While those other Steam things are still installing, I'm just kinda fiddling around. Let's see what we've got. Power statistics. Okay, oh, to do, new task. Update to Windows 10, and then task number two, realize Windows 10 update is deleting, (bell dinging) my files. Panic and complain, don't need a comma there, panic and complain about it online. Wait for Microsoft to pull update, which they actually did. And then, install new update once Microsoft patches it. Let's make a beautiful PowerPoint presentation. Well, it's a actually a LibreOffice presentation. Oh, this theme looks pretty. (scratching) I just gotta find the play button. I'm guessing it's right here. But there is one more thing, boca circles (laughing). All right, there's LibreOffice, well, the slides program. Let's take a look at Steam. Steam looks like it is ready to go. (funky music) Must resist checking Steam notification that popped up. Ah, stupid Steam notification. This one just doesn't wanna do anything. All right, well screw you Stanley. Let's try this one. It has been so long since I've even played this. Gotta get off the ground because we always start on the ground. Rather smooth. (robotic beeping) Let's take a look here. (mouse clicking) The text is so poor, I can't really read it. But it looks like it's bouncing between 70 and 80 fps. What kind of weapons have we got? We got some goodies. Oh yeah. (arrow thunking) That was a waste of ammo. Hello. - [Fisherman] Hey. You the help? - [Krazy Ken] Yes, I'm right in front of you. Get movin' boy. - [Fisherman] Unlock this gate, skate, skate. - [Krazy Ken] This skate, skate, skate, skate, skate. - [Fisherman] Got the key, right, right here. - [Krazy Ken] Right, right, right here (laughing). - [Fisherman] There we go. - [Krazy Ken] Doh, dude, you're gonna kill yourself with that harpoon. - [Man In Cap] Find that gun and no dawdling. - [Krazy Ken] Yeah, be careful. You want this back? Hang on, you forgot your harpoon. (cracking) Take your harpoon boy. Here, here you go. - [Fisherman] Hope you make it back safely. I'll be here, waiting for you. - [Krazy Ken] I'm pretty sure I just killed you, but okay. Oh boy. (gun exploding) I guess this is a little bit of warm-up, before I do the live stream of any Half-Life 2 games, if I ever do end up doing that. I would love to. (banging) (guns exploding) Well, this has been fun. Well, I don't wanna skew too much of my experience before doing that broadcast. I'm gonna exit, but yeah, that performs pretty well. It's an older game, I know. I'm glad that it works well on Linux. There we go, we got like 80 fps, pretty sweet. Well, that was a nice test drive of Ubuntu 18.10. It installs really easily on both machines, but it definitely performs a lot better on here. But wait, there's more. Remember when I said, that Lenovo was kind of having some performance issues, but I did try something else on there, that actually ran smoother? Well, it's true. And it's thanks to a bunch of suggestions from this lovely community and audience. So I have one question for you. Are you ready? (dramatic music) You better be, because that episode is coming soon. So be sure to subscribe and so you get notified when the new video comes out. Smash that bell button down below, and you can be one of the first to see it, when it comes out, in the not to distant future. Also, by the way, I did get Neofetch installed on here. I guess I just typed in the wrong command, because earlier it said, you gotta type this in. And I was like, wait a minute. It said you have to do sudo apt install. I'm like, isn't it normally apt, hyphen, get? So I typed in hyphen get, and boom, now it worked. So yay, ASCII art for everyone. Yep, this is what I was talking about earlier. It is running 4.18, and GNOME 3.31. Well, I'm calling this a win. That was easy, that was fun. Let me know if there's anything else you want me to experiment with, either on this new version of Ubuntu, or on other Linux distros. I know Arch is a big request, and I'll probably get to that eventually. I know a lot of you probably just wanna torture me. Let me know what you think about the new version of Ubuntu. I know I didn't cover all the new features, so feel free to list some of the other features you like. Thanks for sticking with me. Catch the Krazy, and pass it on. (uplifting music)",

    "transcript": "I've been using the Galaxy S10 Plus for three days at this point and it's a phone that I really like but this morning I had a friend come up to me who is a Samsung user He's running the S8 and he asked me \"is this a good phone, should I get it?\" Now this is someone who has been itching for the S10 for quite a while He's skipped the S9 He's been waiting for this particular phone to come out and he asked me is this phone worth getting? And I was like \" yeah, it's a great phone I think you should get it!\" and he's like \"but would you buy it?\" \"like obviously you've got a review unit to check out but would you go out of your way to spend money and upgrade a phone to this?\" and, I thought about it, and that's what this video is about The question made me think about this phone in terms of it's value like what features on this phone or what particular hardware in this phone makes it something that I would want to buy and I'll tell you right off the bat it wouldn't be the big one, the S10 plus that I have here this is the review unit as cool as it is, as nice as it looks this is not the model that I would buy the double front facing cameras, isn't something that I would use very often plus, i like the look of the circular hole punch in stead of this pill shaped one but all the S10 models have this super clean looking front with the thin bezels and every time I pick up a different phone like the S9, or the iPhone 10, those screens just look so much more dated to me compared to this new super clean front because like notches and bezels just they were a thing in the past but the S10 removes so much of it to the point where it just looks it looks so different it feels like it's a completely different kind of phone and there's so many other hardware features on the S10 and the S10 Plus that are really cool like the battery sharing to be able to power other devices wirelessly off the back of the S10 is just like, it's cool it's a feature that I know I would never use very frequently becuase I'm not someone that has a lot of wireless devices like I don't wear smartwatches, my earbuds don't charge wirelessly like that, but for the Samsung ecosystem, it's awesome it just makes a lot of sense and if this was a feature that was availible on iPhones a lot of apple users would just love this feature because it just makes sense and to see this feature come onto a Galaxy device is really cool also puts pressure on other companies like Apple to implement this in the future as well umm, the battery life on this phone though feels, kind of unremarkable in the presentation they're talking about how it has up to 25% percent better battery life compared to last generation but it's still considered just an all day battery and I still have to charge this thing every night I am using it pretty aggressively right now, but it's definitely not a two day battery at all. I also want to talk about the UI it's not switched over to samsung's one UI it is a lot better I will give them credit for that, but it still feels quite Samsungy I mean there's a lot of nice features on it that don't feel as superfluous as older generations of samsung software has but you still have apps you can't remove and even though you can kind of remap bixby this time like you can switch it to either double or singe tap, you can't completely remove bixy functionality but the software feels a lot cleaner than anything else we've seen from Samsung before now if you're someone that needs or really wants like quick adoption of android updates I still feel like samsung lacks in that regard like their updates come a lot slower than other companies like the pixel devices obviously, but if you don't care too much about immediate updates the software is excellent this year one feature that I found a little bit underwhelming was actually the fingerprint sensor it's using utrasonic fingerprint sensor it uses soundwaves to detect your fingerprint and it's a little bit slower than I thought it would be but the biggest issue I have with it is that I'm still having issues when my fingers are wet it's still doesn't read all that accurately or all that reliably and I just thought that the ultrasonic system was going to fix that but this is an engineering sample, it may be something that can be improved over time or maybe mine is just not great but a little bit underwhelming in my opinion uh, I want to talk about pricing because that is probably the most important question when it comes to whether or not I would buy one and, the S10 and the S10+ are devices that are very expensive but the pricing feels, I wanted to use the word appropriate, but that's not really the right word it's just that if Samsung had priced these any less than they did it wouldn't have made sense for the company considering what they have here like they they have the world's first OLED punch hole screen but the star of the show is that S10e they hitt that $750 with a really compelling product and I think they're going to sell a ton of those and over the course of the year, that price is going to drop and eventually it's going to drop to what, maybe $650 and at that point it's going to be so hard to beat the S10e it terms of value, like a company like OnePlus which traditionally puts out phone that are reasonnably well valued they're going to have a tough time to beat that kind of price to performance ratio it's going to be, I think that's the phone to beat the S10e I think is going to be the benchmark phone when it comes to mid to upper tier pricing and the camera on all of these phones I was only able to use the camera on the S10+ and it's an excellent camera but I feel like at this point in 2019 all the flagships have such good cameras I feel like it'd be unfair for me to be like this is better than x, y, or z I feel like they're all just so good overall, Samsung this year, three phones all three of them are such banger products I feel like they made such good phones this year to answer the question would I buy one, would I upgrade to one, absolutely the one that I would probably choose personally is probably the S10e I feel like that has all the features that I want in a phone that you know, is relevant to what I use then, yeah, S10e for me but I just think that they're all easy to reccomend if you can afford them that's basically it, ok hope you guys enjoyed this video, thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time",

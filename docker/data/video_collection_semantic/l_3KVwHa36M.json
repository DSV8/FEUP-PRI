    "transcript": "- Hey guys, this is the gateway to hell. Back when Turkmenistan was part of the Soviet Union, geologists were digging in the middle of Karakum Desert. Underneath the thin and crusty surface lies an abundance of crude oil wells. However, during drilling, the weight of the oil rig caused a collapse into a massive sinkhole, and I mean massive! The crater spans almost 70 meters wide, and 30 meters deep. - [Matt] That's like a football field. - [Austin] Instead of finding an oil well, they found a natural gas deposit, methane, to be exact. Now methane is not toxic, but it can still be dangerous. Just 5% methane in the air can cause a major explosion. Which I guess by definition, probably makes it dangerous, actually. Of course, in an idea situation, the gas would be collected, and used to generate electricity. However, that would mean costly infrastructure and pipelines, and with the Soviet Union already having a surplus of natural gas, the costs just weren't justified. Now, this is the point where they just walked away, and everything ended happily ever after, right? Of course not, this story takes a much more nefarious turn. The geologists feared that the methane would harm the surrounding areas, so as a preventative measure, they decided to deal with the gas with a technique called flaring, where the intentionally ignite the gas, and allow it to burn up naturally. The scientists believed that the gas pocket would burn up over a couple of days, maybe a week tops. And, well, that was in 1971. Yes, my friends, for the past 48 years, the Darvaza gas crater has been burning, and no one has the slightest idea of how long it will keep going. The massive flaming crater earned the nickname Gateway to hell, because, well, just look at it. Since then, it's become a popular tourist destination, attracting thousands of visitors per year. Now that might not sound all that impressive, but what makes it unique from pretty much any other touristy place on the planet, is just how non-touristy it is. There's no gift shops, there's no signage, there's not even a road. I mean, heck, they don't even have a rope or anything around the pit. Tourists can just walk up right up to the edge, but given the history, that might not be the smartest move. - [Matt] Uh, why wouldn't that be smart? - Because it swallowed an oil rig. It could collapse any time, it's been burning for almost 50 years. - [Matt] In Soviet Turkishmenistan, fire burns you! - Fire always burns you! That's the way fire works! This is not the only time something like this has happened. In 1962, the small mining town of Centralia, Pennsylvania had a big problem. They completely filled their landfills with garbage, which was drawing a number of rats, not to mention smells, to the town. Talk about a literal garbage town. The city council voted to deal with the trash heap in the most logical manner possible. By setting it on fire. Yeah, it's one of those episodes, filled with dumb humans doing dumb human things. So the problem, obviously, was that the landfill was placed over an abandoned mine, and quickly the fire spread down through the dozens of mine shafts. I like that that's the obvious problem. Now for the most part, people just kind of ignored it, I mean, this is fine, right? Because of the vast amount of coal in the mines, it turned out to be next to impossible to extinguish. - [Matt] I mean, it's underground. Like, it's not that big a problem, right? - Mmm, keep listening. - [Matt] All right. - You wrote this. - [Matt] It's almost like I wrote this. - You did, you even wrote that joke. It's really meta. - [Matt] \"This Is\" meta. - [Austin] Now this would be fine, except for the fire was not just limited to the outskirts of Centralia. There were tunnels underneath the actual town itself. Over the years, fire started to break through to the surface as sinkholes filled with toxic gases. Roads started to cave in, and homes would start to collapse as sinkholes formed in people's basements. Still fine, don't worry about it. It's all good. Now despite all of this, the residents really didn't react until 1981, when a 12 year old boy fell into one of these fire-filled sinkholes. Now amazingly, the boy actually made it out alive, but this is the point where people started taking the problem seriously. Congress tried to buy out the entire town, paying residents to move. Almost all the buildings were either condemned or torn down, and Centralia was erased from maps as a way to deter visitors, rendering it essentially a ghost town. However, even through all of this, a small handful of people, somewhere in the neighborhood of about 10, still live there. The town remains on fire to this day. It will most likely burn for at least another 100 years. Just like Matt's love of \"This Is.\" If you enjoyed, go check out our episode all about how the US developed bat bombs during World War II, and definitely be sure to subscribe and turn on the notification bell. Because if you don't, we're sending Matt straight to the Highway to hell Heck, heck. Highway to heck. - [Matt] That's hecking rude.",

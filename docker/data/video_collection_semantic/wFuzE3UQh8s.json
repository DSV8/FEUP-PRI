It will also be thinner, lighter and less expensive while having a i7-9750H & RTX 2080. The 2019 Razer Blade Pro 17 looks amazing but not every part of this redesign is perfect since there is one major limitation.

    "transcript": "so Razer invited us over to new york city to check out the refreshed notebook lineup for 2019 the star of the show was the Razer blade pro 17 that's a complete redesign compared to previous generation but at the same time it also has some insanely powerful specs to back up its price point as well so let's get into some of the notebooks right after message from our sponsor the lick tech 2 360 a i/o cooler from Animax now comes in this gorgeous white finish to give your PC a bit of character the EF 1 pump delivers superior cooling performance it's both Intel and AMD socket compatible and it features RGB lighting learn more about it down below so this is the blade Pro 17 and it's a complete redesign compared to its predecessor so gone is the trackpad located on the right hand side it's more it's shifted towards a more ergonomic spot that's more easier to use now think of the blade Pro 17 as a super-sized blade 15 and what Razer is trying to do here is sort of unify their product lineup or the notebook line up across the 13 inches of 15 inches in their 17 inch categories as well so that they all look consistent across the board so you get thinner bezels a more robust selection of i/o ports and overall it just looks like a big step up from the previous generation specs why is the blade pro 17 will feature Intel's latest ninth generation CPU and there are three models of the blade 17 starting at $24.99 going all the way up to $3,200 so the base config will come with a 16 gigabytes of RAM and if I've talked gigabyte SSD which is PCI Express nvme and you also get a 2060 GPU but you can also step it up to a 2070 or a 2080 max-q do know that the price Delta between all three models are narrower compared to last gen so for instance is the older blade pro at least the higher spec model went for around $5,000 which is just insane so that's not the case here with the newer models I'll be it they're they're still expensive speaking of the older blade pro Razer will still be offering that model with a 4k display and a GTX 1080 but it also brings me to another point which is one of the shortfalls of the newer blade pro 17 and that is in the display Department Razer is pushing for a high refresh rate 1080p IPS but on a pro notebook we would have rather seen IPS 1440p screen rather than a super high refresh rate not including at least 1440p on a pro notebook is just weird and we aren't sure why the dated 1080p 144 Hertz is great on a gaming notebook but on a pro model it just seems a bit awkward at least what do you guys think the blade Pro 17 also has a good selection of i/o ports as I mentioned earlier so you get two point five gigabits per second Ethernet port all USB type eight ports are 3.1 gen2 as well as a USB type-c port is Thunderbolt as well they've also included a UHS 3.0 card reader which i think is great for content creators and the fact that it's using the UHS new protocol means faster read and write speeds when transferring footage so I think that's pretty nice unfortunately we did not get a chance to get inside the blade Pro 17 but Razer's actually trying to give users the option to upgrade the basic components like memory and storage so the baseline that comes with 16 gigs of RAM comes in dual channel modes to 8 gig sticks running at a clock speed of 20 666 megahertz but you can upgrade it all the way up to 64 gigabytes there's also an unpopulated m2 slot that can support both PCIe and SATA base drives so it's really giving you a lot of options in terms of upgrade ability as well the battery capacity is okay because it's only 70 point 5 watt hours compared to 80 watts that you defined on the blade 15 advanced models so it's certainly a lot shorter in terms of cooling the hardware Razer will still be using the advanced vapor chamber just like what's found only played 15 so you can definitely expect higher clock speeds on the r-tx 2080 and the 27 t models as well and as well as cooling the intel 9 generation cpu one thing that I should mention is that Razer is really not going for a super slim sized 17 inch notebook in fact they're giving a lot of priority towards performance rather than how thin the notebook is so it's something that stole the understandable because if you think about cooling you know high-end specs on especially a notebook that's fairly thin and light you are going to be coming up with some compromises so I'm glad they're actually taking performance as a number one priority professing a little bit on the thickness of the blade bro 17 finally I do want to talk about the blade 15 lineup so there's still gonna be a base model featuring Intel's latest Nitra and CPU as well as an RT X 2060 with a 1080p 144 to refresh rate you're also gonna be getting 512 gigabytes of PCIe nvme SSD but the two and a half inch hard drive slot will be unpopulated so I think that's a good trade-off and it's also gonna have the shorter battery and of course the inclusion of the Gigabit Ethernet port which is not found on the advanced model speaking of the advanced model we now have a lot more information with regards to the ol adoption that way I'll be offering in the 15 inch notebook so the panel itself is provided by Samsung it's a 4k display wit to support at 60 Hertz and it also supports 100% of DCI p3 which is really nice and there's also going to be a 240 Hertz TFT option which is 1080p on the blade 15 advanced model and overall it looks like the stack or the product lineup for the blade 15 itself looks pretty solid but of course they all do come at a cost so that's definitely something to keep note of so that's pretty much it guys let me know what you guys think about Razer's refresh notebook lineup for 2019 and what do you guys think about the blade pro considering its size or I guess its form factor would you consider something like that over the blade 15 I loved in your thoughts about that in the comments I'm Eve are with Hydra connects thank you so much for watching make sure to check out some relevant content over here subscribe to our boot sequence Channel I'm signing off and I'll see you guys in the next

    "transcript": "so I hope you enjoyed that intro portion for the video because Samsung actually took us on a helicopter ride throughout New York City to check out the landscape and stuff this is my first time here in the city so it was definitely an awesome and breathtaking experience with the helicopter and of course I took my scene 100 so the shots that you saw an intro was you know Shaun the scene went under some of it on the scene 100 and some of it on the note 8 and I have it right here so let's actually talk about this phone because this has been quite an exposed excitement a lot of people I've been excited about the note 8 I certainly was because of course we've you know seen you know things of the past we're just not gonna talk about that but the noh8 has been interesting so let's actually dive in into the specs and my initial impressions about this phone the Graham spectrum keyboard bike Tesoro comes with a new mechanical agile switch with low profile key caps with super fast response and shorter actuation distance plus all the customization included with RGB lighting and macros for a premium user let's kick things off with the display because it's actually one of the main selling features for the note 8 the signature infinity edge display has made its way into the device and it looks amazing in person Galaxy Note fans are definitely going to love this implementation and we kind of saw it coming especially after all that praise for the s8 in the NSA plus technically what you're looking at is a 6.3 inch Super AMOLED quad HD Plus display with a resolution of 29 60 by 1440 so it's slightly bigger than the si plus we're talking point 1 inches so it's really not that big of a difference so it features the same 18 by 9 aspect ratio like the Galaxy phones so you'll be able to get a lot more vertical screen real estate to view content on now just like any other Samsung flagship phone you're getting ip68 water and dust resistant rating so that's a great feature to have on the note we're also having in terms of specs raw performance you're looking at an octa-core Snapdragon processor with six gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigabytes of storage there's also expandable storage which is great so if you wanna expand the storage to 120 gigabytes or even higher you can definitely do that the front in the back are made out of Gorilla Glass 5 now like I mentioned in my galaxy si+ review I'm really not a fan of this glossy material and glossy texture so I guess we'll have to see how it holds up in my full review so yeah stay tuned for that did I also mention that it comes with a headphone jack yeah it comes with a headphone jack which is great now one of the reasons why people consider the note series of Samsung phones compared to the Galaxy phones or the Galaxy S series of phones is obviously the implementation of s-pen so in this case we have a really intuitive S Pen and I feel like this is an excellent tool to take notes if you're you know someone who's just working on the go but let's talk about some of the more impressive and really cool features that I found to be really interesting the first thing that caught my eye was the screen off notes feature so basically what this means is when your phone is idle you can pull out the Samsung Galaxy S or the S Pen and start taking notes on the screen by itself so it has a completely black screen so now since it's an AMOLED display what you're basically seeing is just your notes so you don't have to physically unlock the phone and start taking notes so it's like right on time quick you're really quick to taking notes you can take up to 100 pages as far as I know but again this is an awesome feature especially if you're you know you know if you're about to leave the grocery you can just quickly jot down when you need to grab or what you need to get but also if you're you know taking quick notes on making a video like what I am doing you can definitely do that with this we tried the S Pen features a point seven millimeter tip but it's what's even interesting is that it can even write on the phone when it's wet so again it's also high p16 water-resistant so it's not just a phone alone the S pen's water-resistant which is great all right so let's talk about the camera or cameras to be more specific on the Galaxy Note 8 now Samsung decided to go with a dual camera system this time around first camera is a wide-angle lens with a 12 megapixel sensor and an F 1.7 aperture the second one is a telephoto lens with a 12 megapixel sensor and an F two-point-four aperture with two times the optical zoom both of them feature dual pixel autofocus so expect faster autofocus focusing just like the Samsung Galaxy s8 on the si+ I should also mention that both these cameras come with optical image stabilization so you know this should help you compose better low-light shots so you won't really expect lens blur when you're shooting low light photos but like I said I'm really excited to test the cameras on the note 8 in my full review so here's some test samples that I took with the note 8 throughout my helicopter ride exploring New York City again it was an awesome experience and I was able to capture those moments with this phone and it was really an interesting experience I want to hear your thoughts about your initial impressions on the quality of these pictures you know talk about its dynamic range you know I'm gonna let you guys judge it for yourselves one of the main selling features with the dual camera systems is the light focus feature so essentially when you point at a subject when you switch to the light focus feature within the camera app you have the ability to blur out the background so to create this portrait effect so kind of like the iPhone 7 like currently the effect that what you get with the iPhone 7 plus or if I recall some other Android flagship phones have that feature this seems like an interesting approach especially taking advantage of the dual cameras and creating this blur effect with certain pictures especially if you're taking portraits like I said expect full thorough in-depth review about the note 8 and I'll definitely cover the cameras and of course these new live focus features in the full review price-wise you're looking at nine hundred and thirty dollars us and $12.99 Canadian for the Galaxy Note 8 it is a steep price to pay for a smart phone and availability such as September the 15th so you'll be able to pick one up if you really want the best of the best from Samsung so I want to hear your thoughts on the Galaxy Note 8 are you excited about it are you not excited about it what are some of the features that interests you the most you know the s-pen like some of the features that yes man like the screen off a note-taking feature or the dual cameras like I said stay tuned for the full review I'll be testing on the phone in thorough depth in depth but yeah I guess I' Eber with Hardware Canucks thank you so much for watching and we'll see you in the next one",

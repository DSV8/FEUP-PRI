    "transcript": "CES was another super-busy show for AMD since they announced a ton of new products at the show floor if you haven't checked out our video showing you after 2018 roadmap make sure you do that right away you might be wondering why this video is coming after our CES coverage and that's because we wanted to look over aim these offerings at the show and then combine them into a single video the detailed Raven Ridge Ryzen 2 x470 and more this video will be going over some of the more exciting things in a bit more detail those things will actually be coming up really soon this includes the new generation Ryzen desktop processors and the Raven reach apu's that will combine first generation rising processing cores along with Vega graphics we found a few examples of those at the show floor at CES so let's look at it a bit closer wondering how to fix a boring fan check out halos RGB they are super slim fan frames that light up your blades of any shade come on 120 and 140 member sizes to fit any fan in a control through your motherboard or your fan text case available in beautiful aluminum or simple plastic it's time to Halos your build outline what matters so there's a lot to get through in this video and the first thing has to be the upcoming second generation Ryzen processors that use a new 12 nanometer manufacturing process by moving towards 1200 meters Indy has been able to achieve significantly higher clock speeds without more power consumption or heat production that's super important since the order for rising to compete against coffee lake particularly in gaming higher frequencies in lightly threaded situations were needed but there'll also be some improvements in areas like cache and memory speed and latency hopefully we'll see rise and finally be able to consistently hit ddr4 memory speeds above 3000 megahertz because we weren't able to achieve that before without overclocking and more voltage speaking of gaming there will be a new multi core algorithm boost 8 for higher performance and gaming and other real-world scenarios there won't be any significant architecture changes to Zen Plus and the second generation rising processors but in order to take a better advantage of the lower power consumption and potential for higher frequencies AMD will be updating precision boost and the extended frequency range technologies while we don't have all that much information how these two items will be changing it looks like precision business we'll be able to predict upcoming workloads and further balanced core output that means higher bass and boost frequencies can be achieved more often something else that is important to take note of is with rising - there will be new motherboards but before you panic don't worry they won't absolutely be needed for the new CPUs you see AMD has committed to keep the aim for suck it around for a while until at least 2019 current motherboard chipsets like b250 and x370 will be compatible with upcoming Raven Ridge GPUs and second generation rising desktop processors that's good news the bad news is that even though older motherboards will have some forward compatibility you may be missing out on key next generation features and performance if you pair up an all motherboard with a new CPU the proof of this is a pen with the upcoming x470 motherboard series while a simple BIOS update will ensure 2nd generation rising CPUs are simply dropping upgrades for x370 only newer boards will be truly optimized for them and II wasn't willing to talk about any details but it looks like x470 will feature improved performance additional overclocking capabilities and some new feature level support we did see this at gigabytes so called x470 motherboard and other channels have covered it as well but what we heard was a bit different this was actually designed as an x370 base product called the Auris x370 gaming 7 Wi-Fi but they decided to change their flagship boards to X470 basically that means X470 likely won't bring much to the table from a chipset level most of the performance rising to will offer will likely be from the processor itself rather than the motherboard that means you will likely be totally okay staying with x370 rather than paying a premium for x470 this brings me to the next part of AMD's big announcements the Raven Ridge ap use which will be launching on February the 12th the first of those will be the Ryzen 5 2400G that comes with 4 cores 8 threads with a base clock of 3.6 gigahertz and a boost clock of 3.9 gigahertz the Vega graphics side of that chip will have 11 compute units which means 704 SIMD units or roughly one-fifth the raw processing power of Vega 56 it may not sound like much but this is crazy powerful for an integrated graphics ship and for $170 there seems to be a lot of value here the Ryzen 3 2200G is cut down a bit with lower boost and base frequencies but it's still natively a quad-core part and it's graphics ID has eight compute units enabled at just $100 I could see this becoming the go-to solution for entry-level systems and both of these are 65 watt TDP parts we actually saw a bunch of notebooks with these EP use and they all look amazing with low profiles and great battery life I can't wait to get my hands on some of these one thing you need to know is that even though both of these carry the Ryzen 2000 series branding they don't use the new 12 nanometers n plus course that will be found in second generation rising CPUs since both will be living in Andy's lineup at the same time I'm thinking Bart confusion is certainly possible so make sure you look anyone back to this video for an explanation so you can actually see here that through higher clock speeds they 2400G and 2200G are able to easily outperform the 1400 and 1200 in every single application now I know that like with Intel processors you're buying an integrated GPU and won't need if you use a discrete one but it's hard to argue against these numbers given how low the new Apu's are priced this makes it even more apparent at least in multitrader environments the 2400g and 2200g are not only better than the original rise in CPUs they're replacing but they can also handily beat Intel CPUs from a price to performance standpoint now the 2400G is gonna have a tough fight against the i3 8100 particularly in gaming with a discrete graphics card but it still looks like a phenomenal value AMD even tested the Ryzen 5 2400G against Intel's I5 8400 and it looks like integrated performance will line up with that Intel CPU when it's paired with a discrete GT 1030 GPU what's even more impressive is that Intel / AMD setup will have a TDP that's about 30 watts higher than the integrated AMD solution obviously a me is going to show scenarios where the multi-core architecture is going to shine and these are two more instances particularly because the integrated graphics are being used in both nonetheless there's definitely something to take away from this the new apu's are even better able to compete with the original rising CPUs at their given price points in gaming the 2400G's obviously going to be the better bet given how far Intel's integrated GPU's are behind from an architecture and driver perspective this is likely why until desire to team up with the Iranian Technology Group for some semi-custom chips that will provide high-end gaming capabilities to thin and light notebooks the 2200G is in the same position as well against the i3 8100 but it will definitely be interesting to see how these chips line up with one another in real-world scenarios like with all other chips in AMD's current line up these new Apu's will feature fully unlocked CPU multipliers as well as capability to all clock the Vega graphics subsystem AMD actually showed us that a simple bump in memory speeds will result in a pretty significant gaming performance speed up adding some GPU or clunking on top of that saw over 40% better performance in 3dmark fire strike if that isn't impressive I don't know what is so guys that pretty much close us out our quick rundown of some interesting stuff AMD has coming up in the first half of this year what do you guys think about it will you be waiting for Ryzen to or will you jump to take advantage of those lower first generation Ryzen prices and what about those raven rich apos would you be willing to give AMD a shot on that front let us know in the comments down below I'm Eber with Hardware Canucks thank you so much for watching and we'll see you in the next one",

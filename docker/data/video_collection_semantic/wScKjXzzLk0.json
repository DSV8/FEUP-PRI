    "transcript": "- So I've done a few setups in my day. Most of them happen to be desk-related, but this time, I wanted to focus on the TV side of things. So, this is my ultimate 4K entertainment setup. (bouncy pop music) So the heart and soul of this setup is the SJ9 Sound Bar from LG, and huge shout out to them for not only sending this my way, but also sponsoring this video. Now, to take things up a notch, any time there is a sponsored video on this channel, I'm gonna use that as a way to get back to you guys so not only do you have a chance to win this SJ9 Sound Bar, I'm gonna take that even further and give you a chance for a $1,000 Amazon gift card so you can upgrade your setup any way you want, if you're down with that, let me know by dropping a like, and details on how to win are down below. Now immediately, what I love about this is the dark gray finish. Aesthetically, it looks amazing even on top of a white console, also not gonna lie, usually I don't get to mess around with sound bars of this caliber, so the audio nerd inside me is excited to see how this sounds. So I think it's only fitting to test this out with the Game of Thrones season seven trailer, at least the second one, which I have not watched yet. We got some playback action. Time to crank this sound bar. Sansa, that's Richard's favorite. (Game of Throne theme playing) That's pretty loud. I'm gonna turn that down for a second. We've got some beautiful, beautiful, beautiful John Snow dialogue, which sounds great. There's a ton of low end, so that sounds fantastic here, let's see how a little music sounds. This is Rich's favorite track. (pop music) That's a lot of low end. I don't know if you can take it I know you wanna see me naked naked naked I'm gonna turn that down. That's really really impressive, and if you're only rocking stock audio on your TV, you maybe want to consider an upgrade. This thing makes a huge difference. So sound quality is beyond on point, and on top of that, this thing is packed full of features. And a couple things that really stand out to me is one, 4K passthrough. Whether you're waiting to buy that sweet, shiny new Xbox One X, you own a PS4 Pro, or in my case, have an Xbox One S where you're using it for 4K consumption, your sound bar may only output 1080p, which defeats the whole purpose of a 4K setup. On top of that, having a wireless subwoofer is amazing, and in this case, what it allows you to do is not be tied down wire to wire to the TV, and not only was it the better sound choice placed in the corner, but I think aesthetically, it took this setup to the next level. So you pair those features with fantastic sound quality, Chromecast functionality, which not only works with Netflix, YouTube, but also things like Spotify, and that is a recipe for a killer sound bar. Now from there, you probably assume I'm gonna talk about that sweet TV behind me, but I'm gonna throw you a curve ball and talk about the console itself. Now don't get me wrong, I love me some IKEA, but sometimes, it's fun to step outside there. This is from Living Spaces, not a sponsor, but Living Spaces, if you're watching, let's talk. The walnut front with the off white sides looks phenomenal together, and I get it, some people are gonna see the price of this and say, \"I could build a gaming PC for that price.\" But the one thing I want you to take away from this video is good wood ain't cheap. What I think I love most about this console is the fact that it keeps things squeaky clean. That was my goal with this setup. I don't want consoles and wires flying everywhere, I wanted to look at this and see simplicity. Now specifically, what I mean by keeping things clean is yes, there is tons of space and room for activities with this console, but what it excels at is cable management. To the naked eye, all you see on the outside is the sound bar and the TV, but what's packed away inside here is an Xbox One S, specifically, the Gears of War 4 special edition. I love this color. You have a really cool option to send the cables directly through the console, which really helps keep things clean and on top of that, as you see, there is a ton of space for remotes, for controllers, and in this case, I added the Xbox One media controller, so just in case you want to use this to watch Blu-rays, or to watch Netflix in 4K, this is perfect so you don't have to bust out the controller. If you do want to go 4K gaming, obviously, you're gonna want to wait for the Xbox One X, or throw a PS4 Pro in there, but whatever console you go with, this is gonna hide it perfectly. So jumping from the Xbox, I think that it's time to talk about that sweet TV behind me. And funny story, even though LG sponsored the sound bar portion of this video, I actually went and picked this up myself at Best Buy. It was on sale, I think for $699, normally $799, but even at that price, for a 60 inch 4K IPS TV, I think that is a fantastic deal. Personally, I've always been a fan of LG's WebOS interface. It is super clean, intuitive, and just in case you haven't added an Xbox, or a PS4, or Chromecast, for that matter, you can still use this without wanting to pull your hair out. Overall, my take-away with this TV is you can pick up a really big, really good 4K TV for relatively cheap nowadays. So if you're stuck at 1080p and you've been wanting to upgrade, the time has never been better. Rounding up the setup to the left and right of the TV, I have a couple glass shelf floor lamps from Target so you can see this setup is all over the place. I think what I like most about this is the cylinder element that really complements these hanging lights up here from IKEA. Right now and here I have a couple of those classic tech Youtuber fake plants from IKEA, but you could easily throw some books on there, Zebra Yeezys, or even, if your heart desires, some Waifus. Last but not least, you know a setup would not be complete without a little Philips Hue action. I got a white and colored bulb here, here, here, here, and of course, the classic light strip in the back which gives everything a beautiful glow. Of course, everything I talked about is linked down below. This is Johnathan, and I will catch you guys later.",

    "transcript": "- I have so much cool stuff I wanna show you. NAB 2019 was in Las Vegas, and it's basically Mecca for video guys. So many tech companies were there, and if I had to guess, over 100,000 attendees joined, and I've never been to Vegas before, so it's bound to be chaotic! So, if you're ready to go, let's get started because I have so many cool things I wanna show you, but I'm gonna save the, probably my two favorite things for last. Let's go. (electro music) Good morning everybody! Did you sleep well? Well I sure didn't. Holy shit, there's a painting over there. So, yeah let's go over here. These hooligans just didn't stop making noise last night. Oh my gosh, I had earplugs on, with active noise reduction headphones on top of them, and I was running the air conditioner. Oh my gosh it was still so noisy. I mean they were having a good time, that's great, but holy shit it was hard to sleep. Here's the fun thing, Check it out, the hotel actually provided earplugs, Holy shit guys! Right when I saw those on the night stand, I was like, oh shit, this is gonna be a great night of sleep. The plan for today, is to hit up the Las Vegas Convention Center, to go to NAB and the exhibiting doesn't really start yet. I'm going there initially for classes and sessions, but all the tech companies that I'm going to meet and see, that's coming a little bit later when the exhibitors floor opens up, but there's bound to be over one hundred thousand people here. So it's gonna be a pack time, and I'll document it as much as I can as I go. So after that, beautifully peaceful night of sleep, My video posse arrived at the Las Vegas Convention Center, and we went to go register, which was super painless. You can just print your badge right there. No lines, no fuss, but again we were there early. So, we had some downtime, we hit up the gift shop. I saw this awesome slate clock I was tempted to buy, but I didn't. So I started with a class that was about editing, and also doing sound mixing in Adobe Premiere, and Premiere kept crashing. Wow, news flash. It's funny, cause like, many classes actually joked about how unstable Adobe Premiere is, So, I guess I'm not the only one that's been having problems, or The Krazy Ken Curse with it recently, Or maybe I brought The Krazy Ken Curse to the convention center, which isn't out of the realm of probability. So the first day was pretty easy, I took a lot of notes, I learned a lot of stuff, Then I went gaga over the giant Blackmagic signage on the exterior. Aw man, so hot. We head back to the hotel, get ready for the night, and brace for more cacophony-infused slumber. - [Man] Live music wasn't even bad, it was the 2:30 in the morning. (Imitates Loud-Ass Bass) - Meanwhile, I tried to pass the time with some wifi. Alright, let's look at our network options we have, Oasis Free Wifi, which downloads at speeds of 1 kilobit per hour, um, laser? I guess. Something, something Axehole Corporation, very nice. Downtown Grand Wifi, I just died in your arms, not sure if that's tragic or romantic. Micros Wireless. My personal favorite, tasty toast, Taylor, and uh, Taylor's less important guest, And uh some zappos things. So yeah, so lots of great networks all over the area. And yes, uh, when the hotel Wifi wasn't working so well, I tried connecting to Zappos which was kind of a lost cause, but it was hilarious because their Wifi, my captive window was named 'weeeeeeeefeeeeeeeee', so I guess that made up for it. No, not really. Well, unlike last night, tonight seems to be a little bit calmer, but I wouldn't be surprised if the calmness doesn't last for very long. Yeah, you stack those Jenga blocks guy! Actually that looks pretty fun. Yeah, he's doing a good job, he's doing a good job. Now we just gotta see them remove the blocks, that's the fun part. Yeah, hopefully I can get a little more sleep tonight, oh my gosh. Okay, so it's just a little noisy. Honestly, this is about a third as loud as it was a little while ago. By a while ago, I mean last night. And these walls are thinner than a MacBook Air. Well, Hey, back to the earplugs. So, the next day we catch an Uber ride, very nice Ubers in Vegas, by the way, a lot of interior luxuries and gadgets hooked up in the car, a lot of cool stuff, and a lot of the drivers were hilarious, like, oh my gosh, more on that later. So, I go to take a class on Adobe Premiere Rush, kind of a newer application. But since that was a last minute change of plans, I didn't have the software installed on my Mac, and there was no way in Dell, I was gonna be able to install it on the convention center WiFi. So, the instructor, generously gave me her iPhone Xs Max, to experiment with the software. Like, holy shit! Like, she was very trusting, and I'm grateful for that, just giving someone their phone. Okay, cool, you do you. It was a good class. Then I saw more people complain about Adobe Premiere, and a class ran a survey about platform usage. I was happy to see there was that one Windows 8 user. You sir, have balls, well done. Then, I had an experience I'd been waiting for, for a long time. Strip club! (electro music) No, I meant, In-N-Out burger. I mix them up sometimes. I don't spend a lot of time on the west coast. So, I finally made it out there, and I finally went there and man, it was delicious. I loved it, but many locals that I talked to about it didn't go gaga over it, but hey, it's all about perspective, right? So, now, shit gets real. The show floor opens up. So immediately, I make a B-line for the Blackmagic booth. As you probably know, I love their stuff, and I use them, like, I use their products all the time, and the cool thing was, they had sets put together, so you can test the cameras in, kind of a Quasi TV studio set up environment, it was pretty cool. And it was amazing to see their Cintel Film Scanner in person, like, I have no use for it, but it's really pretty, and I kinda want one. It would make a beautiful 30,000 dollar wall decoration. I will be accepting donations. Speaking of Blackmagic, I didn't bring my Blackmagic rig to do the filming, because I wanted to travel lighter. So I stuck with my Canon 7D Mark II, and, dang guys, the video quality is horrible compared to the URSA Mini. So, that was kind of a trade off, but I needed a lighter rig. So, I just, I needed to travel light, sorry Blackmagic, maybe I'll get a pocket cinema one day. Haven't thrown the money at it so far. So then I accidentally left my camera rolling and filmed the floor for a bit and that was very artistic and then I saw the URSA Mini Pro G2 in person which was amazing. Now I have a question for you. Do you like the color purple? And I hope you fricking do because we're going to the Avid booth and there's gonna be a lot of gosh darn purple. I got to see John Ottman show off Bohemian Rhapsody in the media composer timeline which was really sweet because it's an awesome behind the scenes look at how that film was put together. This must of be a growing trend because a lot of booths were showing augmented reality and like, motion tracking in 3D sets with cranes and jibs and cameras and stuff like that. Avid had one, there were like two other companies I remember seeing having one. So yeah, it's a growing thing. And it looks like Avid was showing off their 3D sets in Epic's Unreal Engines, so it's cool to see Unreal being used in other applications. Adobe had a pretty aesthetically pleasing booth, got to see some presenters show off new features because Adobe just released a Creative Cloud update before NAB and that was good thinking Adobe, good thinking. Swung by the vMix booth. It's a software I use regularly for live camera switching and in coding and I don't know why but I guess Banana Joe is their new mascot now? I'm just confused. Anyway, Sonnet, I wanted to stop by these guys for a bit because I've thought about getting a new Mac Mini but my main beef is that there's no discrete graphics in the Mac Mini but I know Sonnet has made Thunderbolt Expansion Chassis for a while so I wanted to test them out. I was testing out the Breakaway Puck which has it's own GPU built in. The Final Cut Pro playback during the demo seemed really smooth with it enabled but then, when I asked them if they could turn it off to do a comparison, and then turn it back on, the whole gooey started lagging. Like the whole desktop started lagging, even window dragging. So, was it a bad demo unit? Or is that just how shitty eGPUs are? Honestly I still can't trust them. Now, if you've used an eGPU before, please let me know about your experience because I want to invest in them. Unless Apple's modular Mac Pro really kicks butt, then I may shovel money into that. And speaking of the Mac Pro, I looked at their rack mount solution for that machine and it's probably soon gonna be outdated but hey, it's good for now since, you know, it's been over five years since Apple updated their Mac Pro. And again, speaking of Mac Pro, I'm positive that ASUS took a, you know, a little page out of Apple's design book when making this thing. Now we come to the WhisperRoom and Vocal Booth. Yeah, I mean if you need to do sound recording in a room that is not acoustically treated, one of these products is for you, holy crap. Okay, so I just stepped inside one of the WhisperRoom products. This is the version with the double wall isolation and there's like a huge crowd out here and it's like dead quiet in here. It's like, really dead in here, that is amazing. Alright, we're gonna head in this Vocal Booth which is kind of like the WhisperRoom but a different brand. Listen to the noise, pretty darn quiet. Not as quiet as the other one. - [Man] Yeah, to me this sounds a little quieter. - [Krazy Ken] No it does sound quieter, I can't hear the floor at all. Wow, that is quiet. There you go, yeah, still a little noisy compared to the other Vocal Booth one but different price. Oh an announcement. 30 minutes, okay, the Combine Overwatch has made her announcement so, yeah, this is a really quiet one too. Nice Blue mics. So after that we head out for a bit and enjoy some of the night life in Vegas and then head back to the hotel. (upbeat music) Holy shit biscuits guys, that was an insane first day. Yes, the other two days were part of the pre show this was actually day one and it was insane. Well, Blackmagic bag because I can. Blackmagic is my bitch so, you know, I figured I'd go by and take some NAB Blackmagic memorabilia or antiques, not antiques, souvenirs, what am I smoking? Anyway, yeah, I just wanted to get some official stuff from the Blackmagic booth just to say I did. But yeah, oh my gosh, the Uber ride back, just insane. I was with some other people and like, oh my gosh, somehow strip clubs came up in the conversation and even the Uber driver was trying to convince me to go to a strip club. Like, what the, he even addressed me by name, oh my gosh. Vegas, I don't know I kind of like my lair better, 10 stories underground, I never thought I'd say that but compared to Vegas, that lair is paradise. That Uber driver even said, \"oh, you a virgin.\" Yeah, okay. Am I giving off stronger virgin vibes than normal or does he just have a really strong virgin radar? I don't know, I don't know how he picked up on that, that was actually very impressive, you know, strip clubs, great. Well, needless to say, I didn't go. Even though they were very convincing. That was probably the most hilarious Uber experience I've ever had, oh my gosh it was great but it was probably a good thing we didn't show too much of that on the talk video log because we might lose what little bit of our somewhat family friendly rating we have left. So what's going to be in the next couple of days? I don't know but oh my gosh buckle your face, oh dear. Chameleons, that's what's in store for today. It was actually a booth that demonstrate remote cameras but chameleons. Also, before I continue I wanted to say thank you to the folks that recommended I visit certain booths. So I know Microsoft had a booth there. Samsung had some big beautiful screens to look at including a clip-on space-saving display, I think it was called the Space Monitor. SHARP had some big screens, not quite sure how to pronounce these guys, I'm sorry, EIZO, I'm sorry I have no idea. They had some pretty wicked color monitors. I don't know how to pronounce their name but they made some cool stuff. And since I use these guys all the time, LaCie, I just had to check them out. Apparently they have a like a black RAID ray chassis now. That's kinda hot, as you may know, I like black so good job LaCie, very pretty. I'm stuck with the boring old silver one. I guess I gotta upgrade to a black one. And I had to check out Cinema 4D in action, especially with Maxim's recent Redshift acquisition. Now, I don't use Cinema 4D but I wanted to see how fast the Redshift Engine is. I'm seeing all this cool stuff and keep in mind, I'm in the smaller halls. Yeah, there's all this cool shit going on and I'm in the smaller one. I haven't even gone to Central Hall yet. There was a lot of broadcast cameras, lots of lighting booths, a ginormous crane attached to a Lamborghini, and another camera attached to a Lamborghini. A lot of Lamborghinis, a lot of cool camera rigs and Aputure got shut down when he (Ted) was trying to do a speech at his booth, oops. (crowd chatter) (whistles) - To the 30 and 50 foot work horses. But this frame right here gives 75 feet. - It happens to the best of us, sorry. I also got to touch an Alexa rig and it had a cine zoom lens on it. Man, if I had to guess, I'm not an expert but that rig was probably at least 150,000 dollars, pocket change. And I had to swing by Mole-Richardson, I love the design of their light fixtures, especially the vintage ones. Just so many cool cameras and gadgets and accessories. Just so much cool stuff but man, my favorite parts are yet to come. But for now, let's take a break. So as the posse decides to head out for a bit, I actually see a guy get cuffed by the convention center security. They didn't look like police officers, they looked like security guards. But like I'm going to the door, right outside the window of the door I see this guy getting like tackled and cuffed and I'm like, holy shit what is going on. So I didn't film it cause I didn't think it would be right to film it but I'm sure that commotion got people talking. I'm sure someone's gonna... - [Man] They already did. - [Krazy Ken] Yeah, Me too, I'm sure someone's gonna tweet about it or something. I was tempted to film it but then I was like, I don't know. - [Man] Yeah, you should've Ken. - [Krazy Ken] I don't know if I wanna do that. - [Man] Oh don't worry about it, enough people did. - [Krazy Ken] I was gonna say enough people probably. - [Man] Yeah, that would've been great for your NAB. - Beer went flying, sunglasses went flying, phone went flying. (Krazy Ken laughs) - [Driver] You know, people ask me all the time about security in Vegas, I say, you don't see em but they're here. They'll swarm. - [Krazy Ken] Yeah, so he was drinking something huh? - [Man] Oh yeah. - [Krazy Ken] Oh, yeah he was probably drunk. Alright, back at it. So our hotel was actually near the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop from Pawn Stars so we swung by there, that was fun. Cool to see it in person. And then we hit up Fremont. (upbeat music) And then I, being the delicate teetotal that I am, called it a night. As it is a wonderful 74 degrees and sunny, and it was windy as shit last night, that's a pretty view. Well we are three curtains into this trip, they just keep falling. Today is my last day of NAB, I have some sessions I'm gonna go to and then I'm gonna try to hit the floor more because there was a lot I have not seen yet. So much cool stuff there. That's another goal for today, hopefully it all works. Alright, let's go. It has a certain odor to it, its kinda like, I don't know, it's kinda like marijuana and shampoo. I don't know, its probably a very bad description but just mm imagine that if you will. The food here is pretty good though, that makes up for it. The next booth that I stopped at was MyCaseBuilder and shit was that cool. - [Instructor] And in the next step you just tell it the dimensions, length, left and right. - [Krazy Ken] Oh wow. - [Instructor] how deep it is, and it creates that custom cut out. Exactly for your gear. - [Krazy Ken] That is crazy. Also saw a Surface Studio in person, man that thing is slick. It's just such a big screen and it's so slim. Oh, and then I saw X-Rite and the funny thing is I was already planning on buying one of their products so I figured I'd take advantage of their show special. Their color checker will help me balance color in my videos so I thought, why not. So I talked to an imposter Ken, yeah that's him over there. Yeah, his name was actually Ken, he was really nice. He hooked me up with one. Thanks Ken, the world needs more Kens. Or maybe they have too many, not really sure. So now, after days of seeing many cool gadgets and cameras, it was time to leave the show floor and got to my final session. And the instructor for this final session was hilarious and super knowledgeable and the best part was I was able to summon my Krazy Ken Reverse Curse Solar Beam and help him with the computer problem. - [Instructor] Still doesn't work, thank you, thank you very much. Now we will watch this like we would watch it like this. I don't know, you know what I'm going to do, I'm going to try and open it. The command or control shift excellent. Well it lets me, I don't want it to start this, I'm going to try to close and reopen this project. (crowd laughs) I want to show you a tip and now it's stuck with this. I'm surely going to quit Premiere to leave us, but let's see, still set to \"true\". - [Krazy Ken] Try playing. - Thank you very much. (crowd claps) (Krazy Ken laughs) - That felt great. What a way to end the sessions. Now I didn't forget, I still wanted to show you my favorite part. Which was this pigeon, like he use to infiltrate the fortress and acted like he owned the joint. Like nice job pigeon, good for you. Alright, I'm kidding, There were two booths in particular that really captivated me. And the first one was this girl with fluffy leg warmers demonstrating the load bearing capacity of the slider. Okay, I'm sorry, I'm done joking. Ill talk about the real favorite booths now. But I swear, this girl, she just wandered out of like an anime convention or something. This is the Laowa, okay, I really don't know, I think it means frog or something, it's Chinese. The Laowa Pro, it's a 24 millimeter macro lens and it's freaking awesome, you can get super close to your subjects and it has a ring light built in. And honestly, I'd love to use this for Vintage Apple Vault. Imagine being able to get extreme close-up shots of intricate details on computers. Printed circuit boards, mother boards, capacitors, just those small things you can barely see but if you zoom in close enough you can see them really big and your mother board would look like a city you know, you can get so close to it, I really want to rent one of these lenses and try it out for Vintage Apple Vault so I'm super excited about that. And if I get my hands on it soon, I'll test it out in a future tech video log with you guys. But I'm not done yet, I saved the best for last. VER, they had displays set up around a Mini Cooper. So you could drive the strip without green screen keying and compositing, like it was all done practically with these bright high definition displays. The reflections in the windshield added to the effect and you could have just reflections in your sunglasses even, like that was the cherry on top. All practical, all with high def screens, no compositing. So driving a virtual Las Vegas strip, plus that last Breakout session where I summoned the Reverse Curse Solar Beam, man, those two things were just a killer way to end my first ever NAB experience. And if you have gone, I want to know your own stories and experiences. I love hearing them. Well its weird, that was the last session, the last day. That was a great way to end, that was a really fun class. And, but yeah, the weird thing is you get here and there's like all these things that drive you crazy like the music pumpin' and you know, the bar area kind of smelling like marijuana and shampoo. But then it's almost like, at the end of it all, you kinda start missing it, even though it annoyed you at the beginning. Ah who am I kidding, no I'm not gonna miss this place, I wanna go back home. I mean I might miss part of it but oh man, back to the lair, back to the nice, cozy, ten-story-underground lair. That will be much better. Catch the crazy and pass it on. (upbeat music)",

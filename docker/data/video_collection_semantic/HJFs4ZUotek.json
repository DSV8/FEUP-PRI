    "transcript": "- [Justine] We're going to the Secret Island on Kualoa Ranch. This place is so beautiful. This is one of our most favorite places I think, honestly, probably in the world. Definitely top three. - [Jenna] I remember when I first saw it, I was like, this is real? This is real life? And, they filmed a lot from Lost there. - They've filmed pretty much any movie that that you've seen in Hawaii, like a lot of them are all filmed here. To celebrate Jenna's birthday, I'm vlogging on the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+. - And then I get it? - It's actually not mine, it's Casey's, so, I gotta give it back. - Thanks Casey, that's so sweet of you to give me a birthday present. Drowning I'm fighting the worst in you Falling Drowning I'm losing the best of you I'm drowning I'm falling - We've made it over to Secret Island and all these chickens are like tryin' to get our snacks. Just back up. This is my snack. Um, look how brave he is. Oh, he took it from my hand! I am flabbergasted. - They think my toes are little nuggets. - They will peck at your toes. - Yes, I know. - [Justine] Oh my God, I can't believe what I just saw. (relaxing pop music) - Look at Jenna's setup for a time-lapse, it's incredible. Your time-lapse tripod over there is amazing. I'm very impressed. - It's not stable. - Tell us somethin' about that. - [Jenna] I didn't want to say it. (laughing) (upbeat pop music) - [Justine] Oh, for the vlog. - Turn it around. God, your phone is smudgy. - I don't know where we're going. We're going on this (mumbles). (laughs) I've guess I need my other phone 'cause I'm vlogging on the Note, hold on. (building dance music) - Ka'ena. - Ka'ena. - Ka'ena. - Ka'ena Point Trail, it is about five miles, it's to the point. There's a bunch of satellites up here. So they're doin' like some kind of recon missions, some secret stuff. Secret satellite spy things. Uh, oh - [Jenna] I know. - [Justine] All right, well they warned us. (dramatic piano music) You guys are smudgy. I guess that didn't help. I'm really unsure about this camera. Like I keep tryin' to make it happen. (dramatic piano music) Please use latch. - [Jenna] It works both ways so I can get out. - [Justine] Thank you, okay. Oh, this area has bait stations. Oh, my, please do not touch, oh my gosh. Bait stations? We made it. I thought we wouldn't be able to get in. (relaxing pop music) We have made it to the point. We plan on doing this hike at like 6:00 a.m., but we definitely didn't make it over here. Now it's like nine o'clock, the sun is super hot. But the view is awesome. Jenna's getting attacked with bees. But we made it and now we go back. That's the joy of the hikes. (relaxing pop music) We're off on some UTV rides today and we're at Kualoa Ranch, this is where the Secret Beach is, that we were at the other day for Jenna's birthday. Was that your birthday? - Mm hmm. - I think it was. Well, now we're hogging the condiments stand there but we're fueling up and we're gonna go. It's a very dusty ride. How do I put this on? Look how cool I am! You gotta say hi to this one, too. - [Guide] What's up? We're going to Ka'a'awa Valley here at Kualoa Ranch with the girls, let's do it. (dramatic orchestral music) - So, have any of you guys seen Jurassic World? I actually have not, unfortunately. I don't know how I missed it, I think I was busy when the premiere was happening. But this is, this is my friend. I feel like in the movie he probably has a name, or her. But I'm closin' in here. This is cool. Hey, bud. You're cool. Cool for the summer. I wonder if I can climb this with one hand, okay. - [Jenna] Here, I'll make it seem like your filming. (laughs) - [Justine] Does it still look like I'm filming? - [Jenna] No. - [Justine] Parkour. Okay, okay. (groans) Here we are. If I saw Jurassic World, I'd feel like I was in it, right now. I'm gonna watch it as soon as I get home. Hi, Jen. (screaming) (relaxing pop music) - [Jenna] I'm sorry bud, no snacks today. (cow snorts) (laughs) He is so cool. This is Dakota. - [Justine] Dakota, do you know your name? Do you know your name? Dakota, you got a little-- - [Guide] Ahhh, that's perfect. (laughing)",

    "transcript": "This here is- Whoops. There we go. Is another viewer's, well, it's a broken gaming PC, but it's also kind of, yeah. The reason for this is because the owner tried very hard to get this thing to work. They took everything out and they practically gutted the whole build, swapped the motherboards out. I believe the graphic cards was also swapped, just to try to narrow down what was causing the no post. So that's what we're dealing with here. Apparently the system will turn on, but it won't send a picture to the monitor, and that, you guys know by this point, could mean a number of things are causing this. So we're gonna try to get to the bottom of it. This one's kind of a basket case, but I think we can figure it out. It sounds like a hardware issue, and so I think we can fix it fairly quickly. Are you ready? Stay with me. Mailgun is how companies in the modern age work with email. With its data-driven approach and easy to use UI, you can reach real customers at scale.

Try them out today by using my link, mailgun.com/ G-R-E-G, that's mail gun.com/greg, which you can also find the top of this video's description. Hi there, and welcome to Fix or Flop. In this playlist we attempt to fix viewer systems in and around Orlando, Florida for free. We charge nothing for this service. As long as you're okay with us filming these processes, I can monetize these videos on sites like YouTube. That's where I make my money. And I'm just grateful for the fact that folks are willing to give me a shot and allow me to make content with their rigs. So it's a pretty sweet trade-off I think, and it's been working out pretty well so far. What, we're deep into season two now, and hopefully we can keep it up for many more seasons to come and maybe even move outside of the Orlando area. Maybe we'll go on tour and like just drive city to city and fix folks' systems around the country. That would be a very cool thing to experiment with in the future. Anyway. Yeah, like I said, this build is kind of a basket case. I know it looks really rough right now. Part of the reason was because it was just hastily reassembled so that I could pick it up, but there are a lot of issues here. And I think one of the biggest things that needs to be changed is the case. I'm not usually keen on just like replacing hardware for no reason, unless of course it's like a product placement or something like that. And in this case, it will be, from be quiet!, a 500DX. You guys have seen the Pure Base 500DX many times on the channel. But I think that in this case it's warranted because the current chassis is just so old, so dirty, revamping it with a modern case with great airflow from be quiet! will really go miles for this one. But on that note, there are always folks who say, \"Oh, this person tried to take advantage of you. They gave you an old system that they don't even use anymore in hopes that you would give them something for free or fix it up,\" or what have you. Well, first off, I mean, yeah, that's kind of the point. You're not gonna be able to use a system that's broken. So yeah, I mean, reach out. That's what I'm asking for. But to the effect that I'm being taken advantage of. Look, I vet these folks. Before I even meet them, I make sure that they understand my approach and my intent regarding replacing hardware. First off, usually with graphics cards, I don't replace those. It's just, I'm kind of in the same boat as all of you. It's difficult to get a hold of units, even now with prices coming down on my side. So that's the one thing that I say I can't readily replace, but at least you'll know that the card needs to be replaced if it is the issue. Yeah. There's just always a few folks that think everyone is out to get them, and I really don't care. You know, honestly it doesn't affect me either way, and it still allows me to make content and to put food on the table for my family. And so that's, yeah, that's all I'm really worried about in the end. So with that out of the way, it's time to begin the troubleshooting process, starting first with attempting to power the system on, you've heard me say this dozens of times by now, and attempting to replicate the issue described by the owner. In this case, a no post situation where the system appears to be on, but we don't get a signal to our monitor. I believe a VGA light comes on as well. Now that would be unfortunate, because of what I just told you about, you know, I'm not able to readily replace cards. I can make exceptions every now and then, but for the most part, just as a rule of thumb, if you suspect that your graphics card is broken, I'm not gonna give you a free one. It's just too much of a hassle for me to deal with on my end. I can barely get samples as it is. But I was under the impression that this was already swapped out and confirmed to be working in another rig. So I would be surprised if this was to blame, but we'll find out. Here we go, then. Everything has been connected. We'll flip the switch at the rear and power on up front, and let's see what we've got here. We've got some debug LEDs in here, and yep, it is just now switched over to the VGA light, and that's pretty much where it's staying. Actually, is that something on screen? That looks like- That was! There's something on screen. It's almost like it's attempting to boot, but it's not getting into the BIOS. So there's this little line here, almost like it's trying to show us something on screen. You can see I'll disconnect and the screen goes black. So we are getting some sort of signal from the card, but obviously there's nothing we can really do here. Let me try to connect a keyboard to this, and see if we can get into the UEFI. Basically just restarting the system and spamming delete. Looks like we got rid of that little white dash on screen, but now everything else is just black. Yeah. GG. So, this is I suppose where I'd normally start running through our typical procedures, right? We'd clear the CMOS, we'd reseat memory, just start tackling easy things upfront, kind of in order to rule out the obvious stuff. We're gonna kick ourselves pretty hard if it turns out that was the issue, and, and you know, we're like diving deep into the platform for no reason. But because we do have the debug LEDs and the VGA light in particular is on, I think what I want to try first is swapping out the card, just to rule out this being the culprit. Because first off, it's not very difficult to do, just a couple screws, a tab, and you just slide it out. But everything else that I'm seeing here, I mean the system looks healthy. Like, you know, the fans have cooled down. I'm not sure why this fan's not spinning. I think he said he was having issues connecting them. But you know, the system seems like it has posted already, because that fan curve has kicked in and things have settled down. I'm hoping this isn't it, but we're gonna swap it out. I'll get my GT 710 ready. So, in she goes, and we'll reconnect our HDMI cable. And are we gonna have a post? I sure hope so. Okay, CP one's disappeared. Ooh. And the VGA light is back up. There is a signal on screen. You can see it cuts out. So it wants to show something, and the fact that we're not seeing the no signal message on this portable monitor means that something is appearing. And I know my GT 710 works just fine, so maybe let's try just to rule out one other thing that I'm curious about. We have a signal. Something is on screen, but obviously nothing we can work with, so... RAM looks good. I'll check that off camera very quickly. I doubt that's the reason why we're getting a VGA light. I'm suspecting the motherboard at this point. I actually was given the other board that was swapped for this one. And apparently that board had an incompatible BIOS. There was a possibility that the incorrect BIOS was then reflashed, so you're just like compounding the issue, so that's why that board's not currently in here. I can try swapping to that one just to see. I don't think it's a power supply issue. You know, like I said, everything else looks to be running fine. This is a very odd issue. I mean, why would the VGA light be on if the cause is not the discrete card, and there's no integrated graphics. We'll find out. We'll start by disconnecting all of these power cables, 8-pin EPS up here at the top. We've got, oh we can leave that connected. We've got our 24-pin here, couple SATA data cables. Oh my gosh. Some of these are stubborn. And yes, I put on gloves because this system is kinda sorta dirty, although I'm not being tasked with deep cleaning it, so well, we'll leave it as is for the most part. I'll take it outside and give it a dusting, but the hard stuck-on grime, and there's quite a bit of it in here, is pretty much still gonna be here at the end of it. So let's get this motherboard out of here. We've detached all the connections, and we'll have to make a platform swap. This CPU is an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X, so I can see why the BIOS update would've been needed for this board, because this is a B450. It might have supported it outta the box, but some of the older SKUs don't have the most up-to-date BIOS for that, and the other board he has here, this one's an Edge SKU X570 from MSI, so this one shouldn't have needed a BIOS update because X570 is already natively compatible with Zen 2 architecture, so we'll see what's going on here. The board physically checks out, the socket looks okay. We're just gonna do a straight motherboard to motherboard swap and see if that fixes our VGA light problem. Is our new board gonna work? We shall see. Power on. Just got basic- What do we have? 24-pin, 8-pin EPS connected, and then my GT 710 is in there, and we're just gonna be looking for a post. I don't really know what to expect. Let's see. What do we have? A Dr. Debug LED down there. I can't make out what it's for though. Oh, so the light we're seeing now is actually for DRAM. I don't know what's what's going on here. I'm gonna try a single known-working DDR for DIMM. This is just from my own stash and I'm gonna try it in multiple channels. We'll try multiple slots as well, just to make sure there's nothing CPU-related that could be causing the system not to post. Oh, and would you lookah there? That is a post folks. Now let's see what this says. So it sees that we've only got one DIMM installed, single channel. This is just a normal splash screen. So actually things look good as it is. I think what we're gonna try now is that same module in other slots, because we might have a dead memory channel, and just maybe possibly, for some reason, that other B450 board that we took out was just saying it was a VGA issue when it was actually a DRAM issue. So I have tried every possible slot with my working DIMM, even slots you're not supposed to try, which is why we're seeing this message here about the incorrect order of operations. And I have no problems getting the system to turn on with the other motherboard. At this point I'm wondering if he has a DIMM over there that's bad, and just for some reason, the other board was telling us the wrong thing was the cause. Uh, what? Now we get a post? Are you serious? I literally did nothing. I just put his original modules back in here. Okay. All four of them. We get a post now. I'm not sure why we're having this inconsistency. This could come down to just an older BIOS? Let's see what revision this one's running. So this has a build date of January 25th, 2021. So that is pretty old. E7C37AMS.1D0. So let's see if we can find him a more modern BIOS. I'm pretty sure we can. Yeah. We found one much newer. This one came out a couple weeks ago, so that's good. We'll try giving 'im this one and we'll just power cycle a few times. Of course, move his stuff over to the new case and see if we have the same symptoms. We'll navigate down to IM flash in the BIOS, and we'll click Yes. And now that we're in here, we'll want to make sure that we select the correct BIOS file. If you only have one in here, it should be pretty straightforward. We'll click Enter on that. We'll click Yes. I think it's gonna run a check, sometimes they don't. And as of now, it is officially updating. So whatever you do, do not interrupt this process. And I especially don't recommend that you do this while it's raining and thundering outside. That's just like a thing that I have to say for Floridians, because it's like raining every day here. By the way, your system may restart a few times, just let it do its thing. Alrighty. And here we are. So I think at least in the case of the board that we just swapped in, the one that wasn't originally in the build when we got it, I think that the only issue there was just the BIOS. It's possible that we were just having, I don't know, some inconsistencies with the older BIOS, just not liking the fact that we had four DIMMS installed. Ryzen can be a bit finicky with that, at least older Ryzen chips, so that's why we went ahead and updated just to be safe. Everything looks good. We're back in the BIOS now. And the next thing I wanna do is then swap all of these components into our new be quiet! case, which I want to introduce to you, although most of you probably don't need it to be introduced, 'cause you've seen it so many times here. It's a great case. The 500DX is one of those really good all-arounders. It doesn't take up too much space, it has great airflow, great fans included, and some RGB as well, but it's subtle. It's tasteful RGB. So I went a bit out of the box with this one, and asked be quiet! to send a white case this time around, just to change things up a bit. Look, if this isn't this person's cup of tea, they could always switch back to the original case, and I'll certainly give him that option. I'm not gonna, you know, recycle it like I usually do with these old, really dirty ones that just aren't worth cleaning. I'll give him the choice, but I think that this person will be a lot happier with a clean white case, that again has all the characteristics we just talked about. Let's go ahead and take it out and prep it for the upgrade. Whoo-wee! Look at how gorgeous she is. Not only is it white on the exterior, but also the interior, which I think is a huge plus. Yeah, I know if this person doesn't have any white components, again, it's subjective, but I think it is an objective upgrade no matter how you look at it. And the fact that it's clean, it means it don't have to spend a bunch of time doing that, because this isn't really for a PCDC video. I didn't really have any description at all about the cleanliness of the system. It certainly could have used one, but again, I'm only worried about the functionality of the rig. So that's what we're gonna take care of here. And I think actually we already have, not that we really even changed too much about the rig, because all we did was put the original motherboard back in the system and then update the BIOS. And even then I'm not even sure if the BIOS update actually fixed it, 'cause it was working with all four DIMMS before the BIOS updated. It was just a bit inconsistent. So we'll hopefully be able to see a noticeable change in that tendency going forward. You can see there's plenty of space in here. You can get really long graphics cards. You can mount AIO up front up to a 360. You get three 140mm Pure Wings, two fans included in this case, one up front, one up top, and one at the rear. It's just all around an excellent choice if you're looking for a mid-tower option that's not too expensive. Actually just realized this. This graphics card, the one we're gonna throw back in, I think it's a 2060, has white accents already. So that's nice. It's subtle, you know, seeing it from the side, you'll see some white there, but I think it'll help blend the black and white components quite nicely. So we'll get the platform installed and wired up. Easy does it here. With these white cases, you wanna be careful, 'cause if you chip something, you'll get rid of that white if it doesn't go all the way through, and that won't look too good. Gonna install all of his drives, including this SSD here. I think it's cool we can show it off next to the motherboard. Situate his power supply here. And yes, we're definitely gonna have to clean some of this stuff. There you go. And lastly, we'll get this graphics card situated, again with the subtle white accents poking through. I think it actually looks pretty darn good. Has a bit of graphics card sag, but other than that, I like this. This really helps blend things. If it wasn't for this little white bit, it might be a bit too much. Now, we aren't totally finished with the build. We have to take care of some finishing touches, but I do wanna make sure that it actually works, because if it doesn't, well, back to square one. So CPU light is on. We of course have his graphics card now reconnected. Back to VGA light. Maybe two separate unrelated problems. Maybe he was having just some BIOS inconsistencies on top of a graphics card problem. And that's why... I don't know, but then why were we getting VGA lights? Oh, would you look at there? We just had to let it sit. It was just sitting with, you know, I could see signal on screen. There was a small little white dash at the top left of the display, but that was it. And I guess I was just too impatient to let it finally boot to BIOS, which is where we are now. It's also possible that this was the original issue, and I was just too impatient then. And so the original motherboard really didn't need any swapping at all. That's okay though, because he told me that the motherboard we have in here now is the one he wants, 'cause it's an X570 board. The one that he had in the system when it showed up in this video in the first place was a B450 board, so, you know, higher-end chip set. It makes sense for him. That's fine. But it's very possible that we didn't even need to update our BIOS here. I did notice, again, kind of inconsistent DRAM issue, but other than that, I think the VGA light being on was just the system hanging for some things to be configured before booting to BIOS. So that beckons the question then, why is it taking so long for the system to get into the BIOS? Again, it's about 60 seconds or so. One of the main culprits could be a slow or faulty storage drive. So before the system posts, it likes to make sure, well, actually during the post process, I should say, it likes to make sure that it can detect all hardware. The stuff that's wired into the motherboard needs to be able to, you know, communicate. And if it doesn't, then that's when it throws errors, you might see an error in the BIOS, the BIOS might not detect the storage drive in question at all. So it's very possible that the hard disk drive in here is going bad, and I would almost guarantee that if I disconnected the hard drive at the SATA data cable, it would post a lot quicker. The bottom SATA cable is the one for the hard disk drive. So let's disconnect that one. A few moments later. Okay. So maybe the hard disk drive isn't the problem. Maybe it's a different storage drive. I suppose it's also possible that it's none of the above. Could just be something else that we're missing here. But the storage drive is usually to blame for these kinds of long hang times. I think what I'm gonna go ahead and do, 'cause we know this is gonna post eventually, is power this back off, and we'll reconnect that SATA data cable, and we'll disconnect the one just above it, which is for the 2.5\" SSD. There we go. Difficult to do that with the graphic card in the way. And we're gonna power back on again. VGA light back on. There's our signal. Hey, look at that. A very fast post. The 2.5\" SSD. Not what I initially thought, but there you go. That's why it's taking so long. A slow-to-detect solid-state drive is the reason why an owner thought their graphics card was going bad, and they thought it was so bad to the point where they felt like RMAing it. They sent it back to MSI. MSI sent back the card, made no physical changes. Really didn't say too much about it. The card works. And the owner's like, well I got screwed. MSI didn't actually fix my graphics card. The graphics card was fine the whole time. This card is good to go. You just had to wait a bit longer for this thing to post. But the reason why you had to is because of a fricking solid-state drive. Who would've thought? So you can see now our device list. SATA Port 2 has our 3000 gigabytes. That's a three terabyte hard disk drive, and M.2 Port 1 has a 500 gig, well, M.2 SSD. So those are the only two drives connected, but remember we have that 2.5\" Kingston SSD that we disconnected, that's no longer being detected, and that was our culprit. Removing that, disconnecting it from the system, allows the system to post so much faster. Ain't that's somethin'? You know, when I first made this playlist, I expected to have a lot of repeats. What I mean by that, it just, you know, the same symptoms over and over. And I was afraid that you guys would get bored of this pretty fast. Although I think the premise is very cool how we do this, and it's certainly unique, I don't think anyone else in the tech space does it, you know, I just was afraid that eventually you would start to see the same things so many times over and over that you just would lose interest. I have been pleasantly surprised, in one sense, also disappointed that there's so many broken systems, but pleasantly surprised for the sake of the channel that we have run into so many different issues. I really didn't see that coming. And this is yet another example of just what could go wrong, right? It could be anything. This is really something. On a different note. I will say, wow, this case has made such a huge difference for this build. Now it still needs to be cleaned. I'm gonna take it outside after we finish filming here. You guys, you know what cleaning is like. We have a PCDC playlist for crying out loud that should give you a decent fix if you're looking to see pretty cool transformations. But this one, apart from the dust that's still here, looks so much better now, thanks to this white Pure Base 500DX. I will have it linked below if you are interested, and I do recommend you check it out if you're in the market for especially a mid-tower. They come in black and white. I think the integrated RGB is very subtle, but effective, right? It just works. Especially if you set the LEDs to white. I think, you know, you're just illuminating the inside. It doesn't look rainbow pukish, so to speak. And if you have a few components that have white accents, it's really gonna set off a white-themed case as well. So big thanks to be quiet! for being the product sponsor of this video. Be sure to show them some love by clicking that affiliate link down in the video description. With that, if you guys enjoyed watching this one play out, let me know by giving this one of thumbs up. That would be greatly appreciated. Consider subscribing if you haven't already, and remember that if you have a broken system and you live in or around Orlando, Florida, and you want to give us a chance to fix it for free, you can submit a form. It's also in the description. I probably should have ordered that before telling you to subscribe and like the video. But anyway, sounds good. I'm gonna get outta here. Thank you so much for watching again and thanks for learning with me.",

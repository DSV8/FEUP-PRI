    "transcript": "in this box I have a suspiciously cheap RTX 3060 that I bought off of AliExpress and as is the case with everything off of AliExpress lately it took a weirdly long time to ship I think it took over a month to come even though I paid extra for FedEx shipping now this RTX 3060 cost the equivalent of 240 US Dollars and apparently it's new it says so in the title of the listing the price isn't the only dodgy thing about the listing I'm looking to do six gigs of video memory but it's almost a hundred and forty dollars less than the cheapest RTX 3060 you can buy in the US at the moment so I'm expecting at least Defcon 3 level shenanigans thank you oh this FedEx packaging I think is paper that's a first usually it's covered in enough plastic to strangle at least three harbor seals so that's cool although they do lose some of the points for blatantly lying on the bag it did not come in an extremely urgent manner not even almost oh never mind there's all the plastic although it is good to see that box tape man still has a job you can see they did an immaculately even job very nice yeah this just keeps looking more and more like something they had to smuggle inside the FedEx llama maybe that's why it took so long look okay that is a graphics card oh oh would you look at that it actually seems to have a mobile RTX 3060 die in it that is very very interesting uh wait does it say anything about that on the listing let me quickly have a look it in fact does not specify it's a mobile 360. and I feel like them stapling a laptop die to a desktop PCB is an important thing to clarify but that explains the six gigs of video memory and it's potentially priced appropriately that's if and how this cobbled together Abomination works either way it is a fascinating specimen let's have a closer look physically at the card so we have the plastic shroud with two fans and a reasonable looking heatsink you know we've got two fat heat pipes over there the actual thin array isn't just like a block of aluminum that they cut grooves into we've also got some supplemental power in terms of rear i o we have two HDMI and two display ports which means it's probably not a GTS 450. around the back the crudely human plastic back plate does nicely emphasize the mongrel pedigree of this card wow I just felt like I dropped a pretentious wine description I don't know where that came from anyway let's drop this mod in the system and see if it works test system wise I'm using the PC that I built in this ridiculously overpriced pink Asus anime case from the previous video down yes it works very good we've got a signal out and everything but my excitement was short-lived because I just couldn't get drivers installed on the thing oh this driver could not find compatible Graphics Hardware I tried various combinations of ddu wiping restarting and different driver versions but the drivers refused to associate with the riffraff even gpu-z which normally is like a scam Graphics called sniffer dog seemed pretty confused by this graphics card okay so this is getting a bit concerning I can't actually install drivers on it so let me drop this AliExpress RTX 3060 in a different system and see if that changes anything oh this is a completely different system and I'm still getting the same error message really irritating it it means it has to be the graphics card so I guess I'm just gonna take it apart and have a closer look at it oh crap none of my screwdrivers reach the screws down there actually let me try my wish build Ram screwdrivers that actually works I am now very glad that I kept those little screwdrivers I guess before we destroy the sticker we should probably scan the QR code how is this helpful at all I don't understand what I don't even have to wipe the thermal paste down I can see that that's a ga 106 die although let's not be too hasty let's quickly mix that is a GN 20 E3 A1 dial what the hell is that wait Google just confirmed it is a laptop RTX 3060. why won't drivers install on it that's really weird at this point on a whim I reached out to the AliExpress seller telling them that I couldn't install drivers on their graphics card to which they responded this driver with a link to a Google Docs drive that had some very official looking drivers in them okay this all feels a little bit like I'm about to get mauled by a tiger but that's fine now in the text file it's telling me to install the one driver first and then have it not do anything and then install the second driver and then it should work so in the spirit of those scientists that licked plutonium to see what would happen let's give this a try and see what happens this just makes my Spidey Sense tingle a little bit I don't know man again a very comforting warning okay that did nothing which means it's time for driver number two hey it's worked we now have drivers and probably several Trojan on this system now it's not the newest driver which does make me want to see if we can now install real drivers on it and let me give that a try GeForce experience works that's a good Next Step no I still can't install official drivers on here I I don't know about you but I feel like having to rely on Ghetto rigged AliExpress virus drivers is a bit of a deal breaker but maybe that's just me anyway let's finally do some gaming on this chlamydia stricken little graphics card okay so after a bit of a traumatic start we finally launched GTA 5 on this mobile RTX 3060 and with 1080p High we are very much in heavy stutter territory in terms of frame rate so I'm actually going to put the graphics a bit higher okay there we go that's better so now we're running a 1080p high and we are no longer quite in that zone where stutters happen and as I say that it starts stuttering look at that power drone the graphics card is just using about 80 watts of power and we're still getting many frames per second that's some crazy efficiency right there you can see the core frequency is also pretty high often hitting 1900 megahertz that is very impressive for such a troubled little graphics card with that let's try some more games now again with Battlefield 5 we're getting great performance with very low power drill this is a 1080p High settings and yeah we are well over 120 frames per second we don't have particularly high temperatures on the GPU again because it's not drawing that much power like I don't I don't think I've seen it go over 80 Watts Watts actually it just makes it such a shame that the graphics card is so dodgy because it's really good now before I compare it to a full fat desktop RTX 3060 let's just try a couple more games someone commented asking for fortnite recently so there you go cyberpunk with 1080p High settings is also running very well we're getting over 60 frames per second and it's nice and smooth good gaming experience and with that deep Insight I think it's finally time to compare it to a desktop RTX 3060 to see just how efficient it really is and how many frames per second we lose for that reduction in power draw okay with Battlefield 5 it's definitely running a bit better before we were jumping between 150 and 140 frames per second whoa whereas now it's like 150 to 170 so a little bit better performance but look at that power draw up from a peak of about 80 Watts that is almost double for not that much more performance that's some crazy efficiency on that mobile RTX 3060. yeah the same goes for cyberpunk there is a bit more performance but at the cost of almost double the power draw but then there's the other difference of the desktop card having 12 gigs of video memory as opposed to 6 gigs and with a game like cyberpunk you can see it just creeps over that six gigs of memory utilization at 1080P and it would use more at higher resolutions so the full RTX 3060 is probably a bit more future proof and a lot less dodgy with that let's directly compare them with some more precise benchmarks foreign interesting results there was some definite anomalies like shadow of the Tomb Raider and doom Eternal but when I wanted to retest the AliExpress card Windows just refused to install the drivers again it kept giving me like Trojan warnings and stuff and with that what did we learn in today's video well a playgrad could exhibit world-class efficiency and be very competitively priced but it being a playground is still kind of the main thing which brings me to the end of the video if you want to check out that pink Asus anime case video a suggestion will pop up in a second and until the next video thank you for watching bye foreign",

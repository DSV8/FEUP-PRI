    "transcript": "WE GOT RYAN HERE TODAY *snaps* *hits table* Ryan come say hello Look at Ryan A real professional Look at this beauty. There he goes. What do we have today? We are checking out A 360 Crave 360 Smartcast Speaker from Vizio. What's with the cast in the name? Well of course you can broadcast to the speaker in a number of different ways either Vizio smart cast which is an app which will turn your smartphone or tablet into a remote control to control this thing. You can also use google cast which I know you guys are familiar with that's the same thing that gets used in the chromecast that little icon that pops up. We've also got bluetooth and this thing can do multi room so you could set up multiple speakers across your house if you want to. This little bass. One of the things is like how do you keep a charge you guys know, I'm a fan of wireless charging. in general this one instead sits on this little bass and stays charged you put it back when it's not in use still works as a speaker. When you want to go wireless. Boom, just lift it off and go. 360-degree omnidirectional sound, glass touch dial, tap to play/pause, so on. Produces base as low as 80 hertz. Ryan what does that mean? (Ryan): No idea Remember when Hulk Hogan used to do the ear? Ryan remembers let's see it how did he do it? OHHHHHhoho BANG You guys know I love speaker videos. Oh what am I doing here? You remove the speaker, charge the speaker and turn on the speaker. Got it. Whoa, look at this. That's the kind of thing it can fit into the home decor, you know what I mean? We gotta power brick in the base this part here to plug in you see that little connector on the bottom there Jack? That guy just pops right on, like so. You're charging you don't even need to think about it. *peeling* *sniffing* Smells like leather, they weren't joking. I just realized this thing spins, what is that? Is that volume? I'm gonna follow the instructions, it's on the base. Hello there. That's a good look right? That's Vizio's version of me. It's like maybe, Ohh. *beat playing* *clap* *beat playing* *clap* That's cool show you the battery life as well as the fact that it's charging. Different, TV services, movie services, music. You can see iheartradio is in here. It also kind of works as a receiver so you can select your various inputs. So chromecast you see hereI'm using a pixel XL but you can see I can select it and it pops up so there is my vizio cast now i'm connected so if i go to a place like YouTube cast icon up there these things were ever scared of humans think they must have been at one point in time and this is my volume was not easy lunch towards so you guys know drones are the new hot the casting whole day no bluetooth necessary lets go out the base top is made of glass and it's touch sensitive so what pause it also some apps support skipping to the next track so watch while so even if your device's placed down somewhere you can quickly move between songs Packs a punch! you have your own years coolest part is everything is happening over google cast everything i'm gonna do on my phone is gonna broadcast over here no bluetooth weirdness necessary little punch to the gut little base for you you know what's interesting about the word base Jack take that same word and you apply it to fish and what you get you get yourself a bass so shout-out to vizio for sending the speaker out for a quick little test hope you guys appreciate it i know i did also today's episode has been brought to you by audible whose audible those guys online with all those audiobooks so you can get smarter plus because they love unboxtherapy viewers is free trial 30 days and you get a free book what book should you get oh no Jack's been recommending 1 to me what's it called the girl on the train god knows what this man's into driving around all time I got to the airport I'm in the airplane and I want to learn something while I'm doing that you know multitask all that downtime deadtime nightmare time that you're sitting in traffic you could be learning what excuse do you have audible.com / unbox link down below",

    "transcript": "- [Krazy Ken] What, it doesn't? (laughing) It doesn't, it doesn't - [Maniac Mike] Oh my gosh. - [Krazy Ken] It doesn't block out the password? - [Maniac Mike] So, we should be able to install this, no problemo. - [Krazy Ken] So far, so good. - [Maniac Mike] Yeah, I'm actually very surprised it's working okay. (laughing) That explains why it's not working well. (upbeat music) - [Crazy Ken] Hey, guys, how're you all doing? Really, that's just great, you know. I'm doing pretty great today too because I ordered a pizza and the pizza man decided to stay again. Hey, it's Maniac Mike! Look at that! - [Maniac Mike] Hello! - [Krazy Ken] Hey, he's back, he's gonna help me with some cool shit today. And, uh, we have a G3 as you can see, with the big letters on the side in case you couldn't tell. I don't remember what OS was on it, but I think I used it as a Developer Preview testing machine at one time. So, the goal is, We're gonna find out what actually is on here, and then, we're gonna do a fresh installation sensation and test drive, as per tradition, of Mac OS X 10.0 Developer Preview 1. This is such an old version of OS X that it's pre-Aqua. It has none of the Aqua user interface stuff in it whatsoever, so this'll be fun. Maniac Mike, oh shit, I just dropped my CD. (laughing) Maniac Mike, would you be so helpful and walk all the way over there and press the power button? - [Maniac Mike] Yeah. - [Krazy Ken] Thank you, sir, I want him to contribute here. - [Maniac Mike] Ready? - [Krazy Ken] Go for it, here we go! Did you press it right? - [Maniac Mike] I did press it. - [Krazy Ken] It didn't turn on. Try again, firmly grasp it. - [Maniac Mike] Um, I did. - [Krazy Ken] Nope, the power's on. That light's just burned out, shit. - [Maniac Mike] We're not getting any-- - [Krazy Ken] Whatl hang on, it was work (beep) - [Maniac Mike] Well, what the hell? - [Krazy Ken] What? Oh my gosh, seriously, why? Hang on, we're gonna have to do something we can't do on any Apple computer nowadays, Open it up. - [Maniac Mike] Hey! - [Krazy Ken] And, oh yeah, that'll do it. That's definitely not looking good. I have no idea what I'm talking about. It's really (beep) dusty. Holy shit, I had no idea it was this bad. Why isn't this working? (laughs) Alright guys, so here's what we know. We know that it's not working. What we don't know is how to make it work, so we're gonna take a quick commercial break and we'll be right back right after this message. (upbeat music) There we go, it's working, okay! Okay, we got a question mark and a happy face, so-- - [Maniac Mike] Do you have a system partition? - [Krazy Ken] I should. Hey! - Hey! - [Krazy Ken] Happy Mac, alright! So let's see what's actually on here. Got the old beach ball goin' up there. So it's gotta be 10.1 or earlier. Or 10 point, it has to be 10.0 to 10.1 because they changed it on Jaguar. - [Maniac Mike] Yeah, Jaguar is when it's changed to just the Apple logo on bootup. - Mm-hm. - [Maniac Mike] Oh, listen to that. You don't get that joy with SSDs anymore, man. - [Krazy Ken] Well (laughs) this is sure taking its time. So the cool thing about the G3 is I'm going to be doing quite a bit with this thing soon. Actually, it will be featured in the premiere episode of volume 2 of Vintage Apple Vault. It was a very historic machine in Apple's history. So we have a very fun episode coming up with that soon. In the meantime, we're gonna just have some fun with it and get the Developer Preview on here. Okay, (laughs) any, any minute now. Like how many gray hairs have I developed now just waiting for this thing to load? - [Maniac Mike] I think at least fifty. (laughs) - [Krazy Ken] Oh he counted (laughs) that's, that's good. - [Maniac Mike] Hey, I said \"at least\" I don't know exactly how many. - [Krazy Ken] Sure, at least fifty, yeah, that's true. (computer humming) - It's really going to town in there. Whoa! (beep) (laughing) That explains why it's not working well. Okay so, version 10.0 is on here. The clock is set to April 30th, 1999, so this must've been running a Developer Preview at one time. But, since it obviously doesn't work anymore, that just justifies the reinstall even better, so this worked out very well. - [Maniac Mike] At least the kernel panic is self-aware. - [Krazy Ken] (laughs) I love that, like I've always thought that was really, really cool. Alright, well, if you'd like to contribute again, go ahead and throw this into the old CD tray after you hard shut it down. - [Maniac Mike] Yep. - [Krazy Ken] Or actually, just press the restart button. Alright, I got the option key here. Pop that baby back in, awesome. Good job, Gordon, inserting that CD and all. I can see your MIT education really pays for itself. You ever play Half-Life 2? - [Maniac Mike] Oh yeah. - [Krazy Ken] Okay, just making sure that reference didn't, like, go nowhere. (laughs) Oh, you're supposed to load a What the hell, what? It didn't load the boot picker, okay. Well, maybe I should have held down the C key. But, it looks like, - [Maniac Mike] Well, we got a cursor. - [Krazy Ken] Yeah, we go a cursor, so-- - [Maniac Mike] I think it might've booted into the CD. - [Krazy Ken] It sounds like it did. Oh yeah, I can hear it moving. Yep, 8.6. Nice. Man, we're not even past the loading screen and already we've had, like, two catastrophic failures. This is gonna be a (beep) great day. I'm ready. As long as we don't set off a fire alarm, I'm fine. - [Maniac Mike] Yeah, we're talking about it on Twitter. - [Krazy Ken] Michael's got the hookup. - [Maniac Mike] What's the scoop, Brainiac Brent and Maniac Michael? - Maniac Mike's the social - There I go again with - media expert. - another fire alarm, guys. - [Radio] Alright, so, they evacuated the 20th floor and the elevator's dropped, so... The only way down is (beep) - [Maniac Mike] Oh shit, is that the fire alarm in the lobby? - [Radio] Did you hear that? - [Maniac Mike] Is that the alarm in the lobby or the stairwell? - [Radio] That's the stairwell. - [Maniac Mike] That's the stairwell? - [Radio] Alarm on the 20th floor. - Fire, fire alarm, just like last night. (loud beeping) - Fuck! - Nevermind. - [Radio] It's an announcement, it's the all clear announcement. - Oh. - Oh. - [Krazy Ken] Alright, let's... Oh shit, it auto... - Whoa, dude! - Hey! - [Krazy Ken] It auto-adjusted to like, the native resolution of this monitor. That's freakin' crazy. We have been presented with late-breaking news about Mac OS X Developer Preview. Let's go to our reporter Maniac Mike, uh Maniac (beep) My line (beep) My line (both laughing) - Let's go to our reporter Maniac Mike out in the field. Mike, what's the late-breaking news about Mac OS X Developer Preview? - [Maniac Mike] I actually have no idea because it is very late. (laughs) - It makes not even any perfect sense in this type of year! - [Krazy Ken] So you can use this with specific hardware configurations, a Power Mac G3 Blue and White. Yeah, so, only with certain G3s this thing will work with. Thankfully, we have one it's compatible with. So, we should be able to install this, no problemo. Ooh, the old splash screen. What would you call that texture? Like, that texture was, like, always used like in the 90's? Have you ever installed an old OS like this from Apple? - [Maniac Mike] From a very long time ago, trying to get one of my iMacs to get to boot into classic. - [Krazy Ken] Oh, fun. Check the installation manual for a list of support computers. Well, we already did that, so, homework complete. Let's... Alright, Mike, you gotta read this for me cause I'm illiterate. Can you read the whole software license agreement? - [Maniac Mike] I don't know, but it looks like it's easier to read than the iTunes agreement. - [Krazy Ken] I was going to say the iTunes agreement probably like five times longer than this, and talks about like, nuclear war or some shit, doesn't it? - [Maniac Mike] I mean, it's like 110 pages, last time I checked. - [Krazy Ken] Holy shit. Alright, click Continue to install full version of Mac OS X, that's great. Let's look at the languages. We could put Japanese on here, but I'm not Japanese, so I'm not gonna do that. Customize, let's do, We need the essential system software, obviously. BSD subsystem, documentation, demos, Mac OS Can we just uncheck Mac OS? Do we really need that? It let's me uncheck it, so I don't know what that actually is. - [Maniac Mike] Let's just keep it just in case. - [Krazy Ken] Just in case. Click Continue there, and Destination disk? Oh you know what? Is there a way for me to mount the disk that's in here? Cause I don't see it on the desktop. I'd like to see what files are on it before I just do this, cause I may just have to do some formatting, cause it looks like there's already a system on here. It's just crashing. Alright, so let's see what we've got here. We have... Oh, it's not mounted. Okay, uh, hmm. So I could initialize it from here, but it's gonna wipe everything out. So, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna see if it'll install over the current installation without having to do an initialization. It doesn't-- - How much How much space do you have on that disc? - [Krazy Ken] That' an excellent question. - [Maniac Mike] Cause we could just partition it. Oh wait, I can see it right there. - [Krazy Ken] Yeah, looks like we have it's an 8 GB disc, er, almost a 9 GB disc. The disc has enough space for a basic installation. Well that's fantastic, let's see if that will actually... Okay, configuring your computer to... Oh! Well, Restart, it is. I have a feeling this is not going to work, though. Holy shit! - Oh! - [Krazy Ken] We got something. Okay, so far, so good. Welcome to Macintosh. Creating Mac OS X volume, okay. - [Maniac Mike] I'm guessing they just let it do its thing until it does something that requires our attention. - [Krazy Ken] Well, you know, it does say \"Please Wait\", so we must follow the computer's instructions very carefully, coz you don't want to make them angry. - [Maniac Mike] At least it's being nice about it. - [Krazy Ken] (laughs) It asks politely. Okay, so 14 files coped, two percent done, 28, 41, it's actually doing shit, so I think we have some success here. So let's just analyze the beautiful 90's design here. So, you have like this... I dunno what Apple called it, but they used it a lot. It's almost like a... - [Maniac Mike] It's something. I don't know the name of it, but I remember-- - [Krazy Ken] Yeah. - [Maniac Mike] Seeing the option in... In Photoshop. - [Krazy Ken] Yeah, like that is a texture I remember seeing there. It's kinda, I dunno, it's almost like they're cases. Like their espresso cases had that kinda texture. It's like a plasticy looking thing, but they used it a lot. And then you have like, this nice like, bevel look, like with the OS X logo, and these beautiful long dropshadows going on here. I know Brainiac Brent's a big fan of dropshadows, so (clicks tongue) that's for you. And then, uh, down here, I don't know what typeface or font that still is. It doesn't look like Chicago, so it's probably uh, Charcoal? That might be Charcoal. Bust out your Adobe capture app! - [Maniac Mike] That's what I was doing. (laughs) - Oh, he was doing. It might be too small for it to pick up, but I think that's Charcoal. Here we go, sponsored by Adobe. Oh, wow, that's amazing how it just highlighted it like that. We are in the twentieth century, ladies and gentlemen. You heard me right. Twentieth century. - And that's what we got. - What the frick? Ingeborg Stripes? What the shit? - [Maniac Mike] I have to fact check that. (laughs) I've never heard of that font in my life. Actually, that would be a typeface. A typeface, I believe, because it's a family. Wow, this is just cruisin'. Alright. And we're gonna reboot now. We're configuring network right now, and by we, I mean the computer's doing all the work, and we're just, we're watching it do it. - [Maniac Mike] So far, so good. - [Krazy Ken] Yeah, I'm actually very surprised it's working okay. (knocking on desk) Knock on a lot of (beeping) wood right now! (both laughing) - [Maniac Mike] Oh? - [Krazy Ken] Oh, it went away! We scared it, we scared it! - [Krazy Ken] We have menu bar. - [Maniac Mike] Hey, shit, we do have a menu bar. Within it, ginormous package up here, and a package down here, so Yeah, it's reading all these pkg files. We could pause this? Oh okay. Oh, now it's doing, oh shit... Installing all these things. Let's see, let's futz around in the menu bar for now. About Installer, alright. Doug Wiebie, Matt Watson, Grant something Arthur, Jean-Pierre Croudad, I don't know, it's french. I'm sorry, Jean. Minimize Window, oh that's window shade. Bullshit, let's not minimize. (laughs) Services, nothing's in there. Can I tear these out? Oh shit, I can tear-- (screams) - [Krazy Ken] Yeah, they still tear out like in NeXTSTEP. Look at that. Oh my gosh, that is something. Oh, and you can tear the sub menus out. Dude, I could never get used to this. I don't know. I just like the menu bar too much. - [Maniac Mike] Also, notice how the menu bar does not have any curves. Like, this-- - [Krazy Ken] Yeah, they're not simulating like, the CRT aperture kinda thing. - [Maniac Mike] Even though they would do that in the In the first version of of OS X and even in, I believe, uh, DP3 and DP4. - [Krazy Ken] They did it all the way through Tiger. - Yup. - Yeah. - [Maniac Mike] So this, cause this predates Leopard by a long shot. - [Krazy Ken] Oh yeah, by a long shot, yeah, by eight years, yeah. But Leopard got rid of it. Now, there was a cool app called Displaperture. I think it's Display Aperture, or however they pronounced it, and it would actually simulate the rounded corners. - [Maniac Mike] Yeah, I remember my friend telling me that. - [Krazy Ken] Oh, I used that a long time ago. Apple was very like, keen on rounding corners for everything. Like, even the buttons, I mean when Jobs first pushed for that, he was like, \"Come outside with me! \"There's rounded rectangles everywhere!\" He was very adamant about doing that. And, fun fact for those who didn't know, (bass guitar riff) The 68k processor in the original Mac couldn't do square roots, so you couldn't draw circle so you couldn't draw a rounded rectangle. So I think it was Bill Atkinson that lead this little task. He found a way to use addition methods to actually like draw the rounded corners of the buttons because he couldn't do square roots, so, (clicks tongue) there you go. Software workaround. And there's all the nibs which are compiled interface builder documents. Wonder if we can... There's a Maximize button here. Can we... Oh shit! - Whoa! - [Krazy Ken] That's a little too big! We can get, we... Whew, it is... Got hot in here all of a sudden. It's way too much for me. Installing cores, bitch. Installing cores. Hey, would you like your receipt today? I'll give you your receipt. Oh, this one is installing nowhere. Okay. Alright, we're on BSD now. Just look at it. Manman? (laughs) He was bitten by a man and given the powers of a man. - [Maniac Mike] Now it's man with two Ns and seven and four! - Man four six! (laughs) That was probably, um, and I'm guessing manual pages for the... - [Maniac Mike] Most likely. - [Krazy Ken] Yeah, for the terminal. Uh, I'm guessing what that's from, because those are usually... (chime) that's usually what that abbreviation means. Quacker.h? Alright, that's a new one. So right now, we're installing Blue Box, which was the name for classic support. So this would let classic Mac OS applications run in the new Mac OS X environment. Because the OS was rewritten, the programs wouldn't just run natively. You needed some sort of, I guess it was emulation? Not 100 percent sure what the technical term is, but the Blue Box system would've allow that to run. This later got called Classic. It got renamed from Blue Box, and Yellow Box was the new environment for new applications to take advantage of all the new features, and that eventually got named Cocoa. And then, in-between, you have the Carbon environment, which let you tweak your classic applications to run with more of the new benefits of OS X without having to do a full rewrite in the Cocoa environment. So, little bit of history there for you. And we're going to developer tools now. Alright now, well the blue bar's almost all the way full. That means we're almost done, but we're just getting started. We're gonna test drive this system and see how it works because it's really cool. It's a hybrid of NeXTSTEP and Mac OS 8/OS 9, really. Because it's, it's kinda like OS X before it really became OS X. It's all still Platinum and NeXTSTEP-y, no Aqua or anything. That came a little bit later. Alright, looks like we got beachball, so we should be restarting soon. - [Maniac Mike] Ah, we got a loading box. - [Krazy Ken] We do have a loading box, sweet. Hopefully, this is good to go. Then we could have some fun. They had some demo packages on here too, so that should be fun. - [Maniac Mike] I can't believe it's actually working. - [Krazy Ken] Shit yeah, looks like it's loading the desktop. Welcome to the Setup ASS-sistant. Sorry. (laughs) Let's actually do this. We can probably maximize this shit too. Whoa! - I see it! - What's up? - [Maniac Mike] I like how the icon on Setup Assistant... - [Krazy Ken] Mm-hm. - [Maniac Mike] They did carry that over into-- - [Krazy Ken] Yeah. - [Maniac Mike] The future versions, but, they got rid of the traffic lights. - [Krazy Ken] Yeah, they don't have the signals here. - [Maniac Mike] They don't have the traffic light, but they have the-- - [Krazy Ken] Like, little tuxedo. - [Maniac Mike] They have the tuxedo icon. - [Krazy Ken] With a bow tie, very pretty. Alright. So, enter password, okay. So let's see, assigning a administrator or root password protects against malicious, accidental-- Oh wait, hang on. This looks it's like a contextual icon cause now it's got like, a police badge on it. - [Maniac Mike] Yeah. - [Krazy Ken] Password, um one, two, three, four, five, six. Just remember that. one, two, three, four, five, six. I'll click the right arrow to continue coz (beep) you. (laughs) - [Krazy Ken] Okay, to configure your ethernet ports properly, you must enter information about how each port will be used. Well we don't have a (beep)ton of options right here, so PCIP and AppleTalk. - Pretty much. - Cuh-lick! Alright, configure manually configure automatically. How do you want to configure the host name and default router for this computer? Well, there's no place like home, so we're gonna do that. Oh hey, you got a little cursor icon change for the window resizer. Hang on a second, you could... what the (beep)? What, hang on. Can you do it from here? What! Hang on, I'm freaking out here because that's a feature they got rid of in the final release of Mac OS X. You could not resize from all corners. You could only resize from down here. - [Maniac Mike] And then, they added that back cause people were angry. - [Krazy Ken] They added it back in Lion, like years later. - [Maniac Mike] Yeah. - [Krazy Ken] Like, oh my gosh! So I wonder why they got rid of that? Shit. All the things you learn. Anyway, um, this is called local host. Very original. No, this computer's just another node. I don't even know what that means. (laughs) How do you want to configure the IP address? (exhales) - [Maniac Mike] Eh, dynamic. - [Krazy Ken] Would that be, would that be automatic then? - Yeah - Yeah, I was like it's gotta be that. Um, (hums and whistles) - [Maniac Mike] I don't think your net encloses anymore. - [Krazy Ken] I was gonna say I don't think that's a thing. - [Maniac Mike] These are still network, - [Krazy Ken] Can we just skip that? - [Maniac Mike] Still network. - [Krazy Ken] Lotta network options. - [Maniac Mike] There we go. - [Krazy Ken] Alright, this I know how to use. So let's go to Belize, nope not really, Bogota, what the frikky frak? Alright, Boise. Close enough. Oh, there's only like so many options. So let's do (mumbles) what the... What? That's seriously it? What? Should we use the Mystery Science Theater time zone? Alright, we need usernames, so let's make one. I'll be Krazy Ken, my login name will be Ken, my password will be Ken. Nah, that's What, it doesn't-- (laughs) - [Krazy Ken] It doesn't, it doesn't Oh my gosh, it doesn't block out the password? Okay, well, not the most secure thing, but there you go, now you know my password. Hooray. Let's make one for Maniac Mike. (typing on keyboard) What? Does the M key not work on this keyboard? (laughs) - [Maniac Mike] Wow! - [Krazy Ken] Of all the letter, every other letter works except - M - M - [Krazy Ken] Sorry, we just won't give you an account. Oh shit. - [Maniac Mike] No I could, I thought of something. - [Krazy Ken] What did you think of? - [Maniac Mike] Internet keyboard - [Krazy Ken] Oh, there you go. It only reaches that far though. Or that far, or that far, or that far actually reaches pretty far. Go ahead. - [Maniac Mike] Let's do because... Does N work? Yes! - Then do. - N, okay. N Naniac Nike. - Because the N The M key doesn't work. (laughs) - [Krazy Ken] And you'll just be Nike. - Wait, what? - What? How does the M key work now? What the (beep)? - [Maniac Mike] Okay, change it back. Click up there. - How, oh, sorry. - [Maniac Mike] Oh wait, I can just Tab. - [Krazy Ken] Yeah you could Tab. Or maybe you can't. - [Maniac Mike] Okay. (both laughing) - [Krazy Ken] How does the keyboard work when you press it but not when I press it? That's bullshit! - Today on Peppermint Park, we're introducing the letter M! - [Krazy Ken] This keyboard is not like, doesn't have like touch ID built in. I know it doesn't. - [Maniac Mike] Alright, super secret password? - [Krazy Ken] One through six. (laughs) Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, one okay, fair enough. (laughs) - [Maniac Mike] It works. - [Krazy Ken] Oh my gosh. Show login window at startup? Yes. Review settings? Go ahead. - Go ahead. - [Krazy Ken] And here it goes. We got a checkered flag because we won the race. And we need to restart. Okay, here we go. I wonder if there's a Verbose mode? Wanna try it? Let's do it. We'll Command+V at the bong. Oh yeah! - Hey! - [Krazy Ken] There's a Verbose mode. Alright! File system cleaned. (clicks tongue) Skipping checks. Tuning system... I've never paid attention to that. That's a thing it says. (mumbles) Sound's a little low. (mumbles) There we go, you're tuned. You're good to go. Alright, shit! - [Krazy Ken] I love the old restart icon. It's like... Like what? (laughs) Is it like a game of Breakout, like Boing! Just uh-- - [Maniac Mike] Well, I guess we should log in to-- - Yeah, let's log into Ken with my super secret password. Oh, now it starts. Now, of course. Yeah, it's actually a little more secure that way. Alright, let's click the little house button. (upbeat music)",

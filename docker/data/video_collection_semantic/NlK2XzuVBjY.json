    "transcript": "- Hello, and welcome to This is! I have the Microsoft Surface Duo. I have been using it for a couple of weeks and I have um, I have some thoughts. - Oh, tell me more, Austin Evans. - So, this is a very different device than pretty much anything out there. So, unlike something like a Z Flip or folding phone, this takes advantage of two individual displays. Now, before going into this, I actually didn't think that was the move. I thought that folding screens would be better. But, the thing is, when you have two separate screens, it really does make you sort of think about it in a different way. So, I can open up an ap on one, open up an ap on the other. And, it really kind of keeps things segmented. That, I think, actually makes a lot of sense. - I mean, especially when I used the LG Velvet Dual Screen set-up for awhile. I think that one of the things that I noticed, is that when you, kind of, force yourself into two screens, it does become a lot better for mult-tasking. - Yeah. - As opposed to something, like, the Z Flip, right, like if I pull up Discord and YouTube, you can do like, a dual screen set-up, right? - Um-hmm could you just get all the ViewTubers off this video, right now? So I think, okay, lets take a step back. - Yeah. - When you're talking about these next generation phones, when you're talking about flips and folds and duos and whatnot. I would say there are two camps. So there is something like the Surface Duo, I would also say that the Z Fold 2 is in a similar camp, not quite the same. Where it's essentially a roughly \"normal\" sized phone that opens up to be like a tablet. Something like the Z Flip, instead, is like a standard smart phone that you just fold in half, right? So, essentially, you don't really get much much more beyond a normal phone. - Yeah, it's like that state of mind, like, you're shape-shifting vs. actually having - Yes. - something that can help you multi-task. It's like, it's the foreign factor vs. the actual practicality of having more screen real estate. - At 14 hundred dollars, you need to be getting a lot. And, I know that, when you look at the spec list, when you look at some of the initial stuff, it's a little underwhelming. So, if I close it up you'll see that, it actually is very thin, so, that is something I will absolutely give it. And, what are the advantages of going with two individual displays as opposed to a folding display? There's no crease while they are fairly large bezels. The nice things is, is that the entire phone is incredibly thin. I mean, we're looking at, if you close this thing up, and it is about the same thickness as like, an IPhone with a bumper case on. - Yeah, so, like this bumper is fully representative of how thick the phone is. It doesn't add any at all. Look how, look, look, look how thin that actually is. - Yeah. It is impressive. - It's really, really impressive for having two screens. - It is. - It is an impressive piece of hardware, which is, basically how I feel about every Surface product. I mean, this carries on that kind of tradition, right, of having really, really good design. I mean, by far, my favorite thing about this is the hinge. - Yes. So, one of the nice things about it, so, the Z Flip actually does a pretty good job so you can kind of hold it in a couple of different orientations so it will stand up. When you look at something like the Surface Duo, think about a more, like, a two in one laptop. So, you can use it in a bunch of different orientations, but essentially that hinge will stop at any point. So, you can use it as a single display, you can use it in, like, tent mode, you can flip it up. There are a lot of different things that you can do with it which, I am a huge fan of, right? The hardware is great, except for the physical size. My issue with the Surface Duo is the fact that you have two fairly large four by three displays. Nothing wrong with that. But, because you have the bezels and because you have such a wide sort of screen, it's not great as a phone. - Yeah. - So, let me give you an example. So, I'm on a phone call, right? Look how silly that looks. It is so wide. Like, it's a massive phone and, even when, like, typing. So, they have some things, like so, inside swift key, so, I open up a Tweet here. So, there are a few things that jump out to me about the width being a little bit of a problem. - Yeah. - So, something like swift key is smart and it's built in to the keyboard, or, built in to the phone, where it will shrink the keys down. So, if you're using it in dual screen mode you obviously can't, sort of, dual screen type. - Yeah, so it just shifts the key board over to the left to make it easier to type. - But, then if I close it up you'll see the keyboard actually will expand to be full size. Which, is not crazy. It does take some getting used to. But, the thing is, when I'm using it as a phone it's not that comfortable. It's just a very big, wide device. There's nothing wrong with that. - Yeah. - But, you shouldn't be buying this phone to use as a standard single screen device. You really need to get the most out of using it as a multi-tasking beast. So, the spec. A lot of people have been talking about the performance, the battery life. This is using last year's Snapdragon 855 processor. It has a decent but not massive battery. I will say those are actually not major concerns after spending some time with the device. So, yes, the 855 means that you lack things like 5G, it only has 6 gigs of RAM, it has 128 or 256 of storage. - Which, 6 gigs of RAM is a little weird for a device that - Fourteen hundred bucks. - you, well, not only for price but, it's supposed to be a multi-tasking beast with those dual displays, right? Six gigs? It seems a little... - A little light - Yeah. - In using it though, I actually didn't really have any major issues - Mm-hmm. - with the performance. I mean, keeping two apps open at the same time is fine. Where I'm having more problems is with the camera. So, if you take a look on the outside of the device you'll see that, um, there are no cameras. Because, instead you essentially have one front facing camera. Which is a unusual choice, right? So, if you open it up you'll be able to see that it works in selfie mode or if I want to flip it over I can double tap and then I can now use it as, a like, \"oh look! I'm taking a picture\". - Now, what is the quality of that camera? Is that something... - Front facing. - Okay. It is, it is like a traditional front facing camera where it's just, it's fine, it's passable, but. - You do not wanna take photos of the, like, anything besides like a selfie on this, is basically what I would say. - Which, people buying this device - Yeah. - might not necessarily care but, it's still a fourteen hundred dollar device. - So, here's the thing. I do understand why they made this limitation. So when you look at the each, of the individual sides, it's about 4.8 or 4.9 millimeters thick. Very, very thin. - Right. - If you look at something like the Iphone. One of the reasons why the phone is as thick as it is, and this goes for pretty much any modern flagship, to have a good camera on board, you need a lot of z-heights, so you need a lot of depth there. That's why you see stuff like camera balls because that is really what you need to fit a large sensor and a large lens, you need as much, sort of, vertical height as possible. They obviously didn't wanna make this thing super thick. Cause, can you imagine if you make one side thick, you'd have to make the other side thick. - Right. - The problem is, with my stuff, is the Z Flip and the Z Fold are a little bit on the chunkier side. But, when you're using it as your only phone. I would say that the camera on this is not acceptable for anything beyond, like, selfies, right? - Yeah. - And, if you're using this as your fourteen hundred dollar main daily driver, to me, to me personally, - Yeah. - that is a deal breaker. - But, I still think that Surface Products, whatever they are brought out to market, especially for new stuff like this, - Mm-hmm. - they're usually only 70% of the way there. - The version of Android here is not perfect, right? So, - Okay. - it's reasonably stocked but, things like if you want to go multi-task, I'll do it on this side, so you can see it's a little stutter-y and also, like, you have to, like, swipe on, like, the sides and stuff. It's a little bit odd, I mean, - Yeah, it's like, I don't - but for optimization, that can be improved. - As time goes on, - But here, here's one of my - here's one of my least favorite things, right? It's so hard to actually, like, close something out. Like, it gets very, like, stuck. You have to really push it forward. Like, there's small issues with the version of Android that they're running. - One of the things that bothers me, so, as a, quote-unquote, single screen device, cause that's the way I use it probably 70% of the time, - Right? - I don't want to have to, like every time I pull it out of my pocket, unfold it, right? So, a lot of times I'll actually put it in my pocket with these screens facing out. Which, is fine. It, you just pull it out, - I mean - put your fingerprint on - it's, it's the same Gorilla Glass 5, right? - Five, yes - On the inside and the outside, right? - Yes, yes. - So, there shouldn't be a problem with that. I mean, if you're using a traditional phone anyway... - Sort of. I will say, yeah, yeah you are correct. But, you have all of, obviously your screens are exposed. The only down side to that, is that, if I have it closed I know that my screens are much more protected cause who cares if the back gets scratched. - Correct. I mean, that's, that's why I like phones like the Z Flip, right? - Seriously. - When it's in my pocket it's, totally fine, I mean, this has a little bit more of a (laughs) has a little bit more danger of a, you know, getting damage to the inside screen if you were to, you know keep it - So, - unfolded in your pocket, but. - so, if I'm going to just unlock the phone so that the fingerprints are right here, watch how long it takes. That's slow. - It's not - That's slow. - a deal-breaker for me but it is - Watch. - certainly slower than like, - Watch this. Ready, set, boom. - Yeah. - Instant, right? I don't understand why that needs to be the case. So, okay, if we're just going to cut to the chase on my final thoughts on the Surface Duo which, I know there's a lot more to talk about. I think that is a good phone for someone who does a lot of multi-tasking and it is not for anyone else. If you don't think that you're going to take advantage of these displays in a real, meaningful way, this is not the phone for you, right? - Right. - So, anyone can take advantage of it. Let me be very clear. The way that they designed it, actually is pretty clever. So, the way that you can, sort of, moves apps in between devices and, between screens, and stuff, like, it works well. You can expand things. There's a lot of good stuff there. - Yeah. - But, the problem is, is that, yes, I enjoy playing Clash Royale on one screen and watching YouTube on the other, or, reading a website on one side, and taking notes on docs on the other. Like, - Yeah. - there are some uses. Most of those uses for me, personally, again, I want to be very clear, this is for me, Austin Evans personally, the way I use it. For all of those uses, I would rather have a laptop, a tablet, something that is much more PC like. Because, if I'm getting into, like, real research, or doing lots of things like that, for me personally, I want, like, a keyboard, I want, like, a track pad, or a mouse, or something. I'm not going to be doing, you know, writing, you know, thousands of words on my phone, regardless of how much of a laptop-y looking thing it is. - It does, it does feel like it's made for very specific people. - I don't think 90% of people who will buy this, can use it as their only daily device. - Yeah. - Right? So you also have to consider that there are some other things that you're missing, right? No water resistance, whatsoever. I'm not gonna get it wet. I don't, I mean, it might be okay for light stuff but, you don't wanna get this thing wet. It's big and bulky so, if you look at it compared to a Z Flip, I mean, look at the size of just, like, the footprint, right? It might be a little thicker. But, I mean, that's a much larger device in your pocket. - Yeah. - Even more so than something, like, an IPhone, right? I mean, you can see it as - That width - significantly wider. - That width is kind of nuts. I mean, again like, one of the reasons why I like the Z Flip and, while I'll even yield to the Z Fold, - Yeah. - Right? Is the idea that it is pocketable. - My verdict on this, and obviously, having only used it for a couple weeks, I'm sure it will continue to evolve, is this. If you want a Surface Duo, you should have a very good idea of the kind of use case that you will be using it for, right? If you're just using it to be on Twitter and Instagram at the same time, or to watch YouTube on one side and, another YouTube video on the other side, even though I don't even know if that's possible, - (laughs) - It's not. Probably the greatest move in the world, right? - I may have (inaudible) before. - It's a unique device, though. - It is. - I will say, it's unique, right? Nothing else on the market will give you the kind of experience that the Surface Duo has. I will say hardware's great, I will say that the software, a little rough, but I'm sure - Microsoft is the only one that can get away with this. - Yes! I will agree with that. - (laughs) - Yeah. That's, and I'm, I'm sure that they worked with Google, I mean, they did, they did mention, actually, that they worked - Yes. - with Google to optimize the software. And, I, it's come a long way, the dual screen set-up, it's come a long way on the Android side. As someone who's used the LG Velvet with a dual screen, I will tell you, that this is miles better on the software side. Just because there is that, kind of, thought that goes into (laughs) what multi-tasking actually is for dual screens. - Yes. - It's not just a gimmick. This was actually purpose built for it. - Yeah. This is a cool device, it is a very well crafted device, and I'm sure will continue to get better with software updates. They've also committed to several years. - Yeah. - But, it's not a daily driver and, I think, because of that, I'm out. Z Flip gang for life. Thank you very much for watching this episode of This Is!

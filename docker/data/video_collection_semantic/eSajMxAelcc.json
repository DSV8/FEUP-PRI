    "transcript": "(bright upbeat music) - All right, it is Windows 11 time. Microsoft announced this new operating system just last week and now they've released a preview build that anyone can go and grab and download and install onto their machines. Now, whether or not you should do that, that's entirely up to you, but it's kind of my job, so I've gone ahead and installed it on my desktop PC and I want to take you through a bunch of the new changes in Windows 11. So, there's a new Start menu. There's a new interface with all sorts of design changes. There's a new store, there's a bunch of new, new, new, and there's some familiar stuff as well. So, this is Windows 11. (bright upbeat music) So, the first thing you'll notice when you first play around with Windows 11, is it centered. The task bar, centered. The Start menu, centered. Yes, it's centered. It looks a lot like macOS, Chrom OS, that sort of thing. Like, it really feels like you're using an Android phone. Like you said, a launcher basically. I can see all my apps, I can go back and pin apps, and I kind of don't mind that. Like, I feel like it's a lot more simplified and I feel like that is the big thing about Windows 11. I will go into all the design changes, but simplification and just the design tweaks, that's the big thing you're really gonna notice the first time you use Windows 11. Now, talking about design tweaks, let's take a look at the system tray. Now, before, you'd have had a volume sort of fly out, that would be up the top here, but now Microsoft's kind of simplified it. You can control the volume from down here, there's airplane modes or quick settings that you can get to, or you can jump into the full settings interface here. Now, look at Settings. It looks completely different to Windows 10 Settings. There's a navigation bar down the side. I no longer have to sort of dig in, like, say, you're going into Windows Update. I can check an update history and I'm like, \"Okay, let me just go check my Bluetooth devices.\" Like I can really quickly get between sections. Now, this will take, if you're used to using Windows, it will take a couple of hours to get used to. It really kind of threw me off trying to work out where all the settings were, but as I've gotten used to it, I really liked this. Like, I just really like where Microsoft's heading with this simplification. And I feel like you'll find this obviously elsewhere in Windows 11 as well. Now, let's look at File Explorer. Now, File Explorer used to have this sort of ribbon interface that used to be very much like this. Now, they've actually removed that in favor of a command bar. And I think we're gonna see this sort of interface sharp a lot more in Windows 11. It's not quite there everywhere just yet. If I look at Notepad, it uses like an old menuing system, but I think we're gonna see the show up a bunch. And I kind of like it. It just feels, again, a lot more simplified. I don't want to say the word simplified a hundred times in this video, but really that's kind of what it's all about. Now, another area that's changed, it's obviously the Notification Center as well, well, Action Center as Microsoft calls it. So, you get your notifications, you can obviously swipe those away easily. You've got the calendar that pops out here, you can obviously shrink that. So it's a little bit more customizable there, but it just looks a lot better. And if I dig back into the Settings, I can actually show you some of the UI changes here in the dark mode. So, we're obviously in light mode now. If I go into like Start and Run, that would be all light mode. If I flick over to dark mode, it takes a few seconds for it to sort of like change. You'll notice that there's the Settings panel will also change as well. Now, I prefer the dark mode personally. So here we go. We're in dark mode now. So, this just looks a lot better. I just prefer the Start menu here. File Explorer will obviously be dark as well. They haven't quite put dark mode everywhere. I'd really like to see this in the Run. I'd like to see this in Task Manager and stuff like that, but hopefully that will come before this actually ships. And there's also a bunch of different themes that Microsoft's added in here. So, I can put this theme on, which is a default one, or maybe this one. And this kind of shows us some of the subtleties to Microsoft's design here. So, let me just show you. If I hover over like this up here, you see the color sort of shining through on the window here and immediately, if I switch away, so say, I bring up like Settings. You see that color's no longer there. But as soon as it's in view the color's there. So it gives it that sort of like depth in the design. I kind of liked that real subtlety of Windows 11. It's those real subtle changes that just makes it look and feel like new. (gentle music) So not everything is perfect in Settings. So I was really hoping if I dug into stuff like the mouse settings, and I wanted to do some additional mouse settings, that it wouldn't do this and frame me into this sort of like old interface of Windows. And, you know, the Control Panel is still there. Like, obviously I feel like that's there because Microsoft wants people to be able to get to that stuff that they rely on, but I don't like the way that it kind of shows you into this old interface. All these settings really should be in the settings by now, and I'm not quite sure why they're not. Now, one of the other real big UI changes to Windows 11 is widgets. Now, instead of being buried in a Task Bar here, they're actually got their own button now and it slides out from the left. So, you'll see there's a bunch of different widgets. There's a weather widget, there's, you know, I'm getting updates on the Euro soccer games, there's news, all that sort of stuff. I feel like we're eventually gonna get third-party ones from developers, but they're not quite there just yet. So, you can choose from a bunch of Microsoft ones. Now, these Windows widgets may remind you of Windows Vista, but you can't actually grab these widgets and sort of drag and drop on the desktop just yet. I don't know whether that will come to Windows 11 or not, but they kind of contained within their own system here. And one of the things I really don't like about this though, is if I click on the News section here and I want to see one of these articles, it will throw me into Microsoft Edge, which isn't my default browser. And it seems like Microsoft is not adhering to the default browser stuff here. I really hate that. And it's actually a big part of the Search as well. So, say I search from the Verge. Like once again, I have Chrome set as my default browser. It's gonna throw me into Edge. Now, I kind of get why Microsoft's doing this, 'cause they want to force people into Edge, but I feel like it's really irky and I really wish they wouldn't do that. And they would respect my browser defaults. Now, beyond some of the surface-level UI work, there's actually some really interesting multitasking changes here. So, obviously in Windows, you've been able to sort of snap Windows side by side in Windows 10 and a bunch of different Windows operating systems over the years, but Microsoft's gone a little bit of a step further here. So, if I hover over the maximize button, you'll see a bunch of different snap layout. That's basically what Microsoft's calling these. And it's really an easy and quick way of surfacing all the different sort of snap modes that Windows has had for years and just making them really easy for people to discover them and use them. So, look, there's this three by three snap mode here. I'm gonna launch that up, and gonna put Paint here, and I'm gonna put Xbox here. And there you go. Immediately, I've got three apps side by side. And I can obviously snap these back into place where they were, minimize them, all that sort of stuff. It just makes things a lot more accessible. (gentle music) There's also bunch of gaming improvements in Windows 11. I'll talk you through some of those. Now, this is the new Xbox app. I say new, but it's actually been around for sort of six months, and you might recognize it if you've been using a Windows 10. Either way, you get access to Game Pass, all your social stuff and obviously the store as well. And it's basically the sort of like hub for the Xbox stuff. So, eventually it will have xCloud integration. So, you'll be able to stream Xbox games to your PC. That's not there quite yet, but this is what's there right now. Another feature they're bringing from the Xbox side is direct storage, which will speed up all of your game load times on compatible games. Now, you'll need an MVMe or PCIe 3 or 4 SSDs just to really take advantage of this. And I don't believe it's quite there in the preview build yet. So, we'll have to see how that works out. Dynamic refresh rate is a new windows 11 feature and it basically lets your device refresh at dynamic rates. So what that means is gonna be really important on laptops. So, imagine you've got 120 Hz display. Microsoft will actually dynamically alter that. So, you might be running at 60 Hz the majority of the time, but it will shoot up to 120 Hz when you're doing stuff like inking or you're scrolling and stuff like that. What that does is it saves battery. (bright upbeat music) Okay, so up next is the Microsoft Store. Oh, yes, the Microsoft Store, the Windows Store, Windows App Store, whatever you want to call it, is getting massively overhauled in Windows 11. So, as you can see, this is the brand new store here. And it looks a lot different to the Windows 10. There's obviously an apps section, there's a gaming section and entertainment section, but really it's been sped up, it looks a lot better and the big key thing is that you might actually get some apps in here that you care about. So, Microsoft is allowing developers to add in Win 32 apps. So, I think we're gonna see a bunch of like desktop apps appear in this store in the coming months. WinZip's there today, there's a bunch of PWAs as well, Microsoft is allowing those in the store. So, I think we're gonna see some pretty interesting apps appear here. And obviously Adobe's on board as well. One of the other key changes the store is that Microsoft is allowing developers to bring their own commerce agents to the store. Now, what this means is that they can keep 100% of their revenue if they do this. So, they use their own payment platform system or a third-party one and they didn't have to pay Microsoft a penny. I think that's huge, and it could mean we see a bunch of new apps that we haven't seen here before. Microsoft's been a lot more open with this store. And I think that's great for developers and end consumers at the end of the day. Hopefully, we'll see a bunch of new apps and maybe some familiar storefronts. Like, I really hope that we see Steam games and apps appear in here. Maybe if it just links out to Steam. I don't care, I just want this to be a central location where I can just get all the apps I actually care about. And speaking of the store, there's a big missing part of this that we can't test just yet, and it's Android apps on Windows. That was a huge announcement when Microsoft made that last week. They're gonna be running alongside Windows apps. So, you'll be able to side-by-side these applications just as if they were Windows apps. So, what you're need to do is you'll be able to go into the store and search for something like TikTok, and you might find like the Android version of it, it'll say go out to the Amazon app store. Like I think this is a big deal beyond just the Android apps as well 'cause I feel like it's gonna mean that Microsoft's gonna to open their store up to rival app stores. Now, I know a bunch of you are probably watching this thinking, \"Why do I need Android apps on my Windows PC?\" And I think that's a fair point, but there are some apps like home automation apps like Ring and stuff like that just aren't available on the web. And I feel like just getting those Android apps on my PC, there's probably only one or two that I really care about, but it'd be really nice to have them PC. (bright upbeat music) Speaking of other things that are missing from this preview build, the Microsoft Teams integration. So that was also another big deal that Microsoft announced last week and we can't quite test it just yet. But basically what it's gonna mean is Microsoft Team is gonna be integrated into the task bar. So, you can like right click, send someone a message or start a video call, all that sort of stuff. Now, this is only integrated for consumers at first and not commercial customers, so I'm not sure exactly when that's gonna arrive for commercial customers in Windows 11. And I think one thing that Microsoft Teams getting integrated into Windows 11 says about Microsoft is I don't know what's gonna happen with Skype. Like, that used to be bundled with Windows 10 and now it's not, so bye-bye Skype? (bright upbeat music) There are some questions that remain around Windows 11, though. Can Microsoft create a consistent UI across the OS? How will Android apps run? And most importantly, will your PC even get Windows 11? Microsoft doesn't seem to be able to answer exactly what the minimum requirements will be for Windows 11 PCs just yet. Now, we've obviously got months of testing to go. So, some things will change, but it really feels like Microsoft's trying to strike a tricky balance between security and the traditional openness of Windows. I think between now and October, which is when we're expecting Microsoft to launch Windows 11, we're gonna hear a bunch more about this new operating system. And I'm hoping we're gonna see some surprises along the way and just some general improvements to what's already looking like a pretty solid foundation. Okay, thanks for watching our first look at Windows 11. We've obviously been covering a bunch more of this at theverge.com, so check that out and don't forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel.",

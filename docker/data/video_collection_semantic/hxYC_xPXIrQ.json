    "transcript": "Where am I gonna put m- I feel like I wanna put my hands there but Ive never started a video like that ever before... What's up guys! Lew here back with another video and today I've got something I am very excited about. I think you will be too. It's the new MacBook, incredibly thin, incredibly light, but this one has been outfitted a little bit differently. It is currently wearing a D-brand skin of the carbon-fiber-like variety. I don't think there's another new MacBook on the planet that looks like this right now or just yet this is a two-pound laptop. No internal fans, you've got the lower powered CPU of course as a result of being as thin as it is as light as it is and the thermal performance necessary. It's got Intel graphics and course the controversial USB type-C port. This is in the New Age USB. It has some benefits it has some drawbacks. Benefits. Drawbacks. Alright, enough with the outside of the box; let's jump inside and see what this MacBook is all about... Wow. As I told you guys, this baby is special with the carbon-fiber-like finish, and this goes really, really well with the space grey interior. My goodness! Check that baby out. You've even got the carbon fiber finish right on the trackpad. So let's go ahead and look at the other items inside the box besides the pretty laptop. We have our USB-C cable right here. That's tiny... That is a tiny little connector! We also have some paperwork from Apple. That's to be expected along with some stickers. Probably! Hopefully! The classic Apple stickers. 'Little bit darker than usual? Is that to go with the space grey? Possibly. A tiny little powerbrick as well. Now, a couple more things about USB-C before checking out the inside of this laptop. It'll charge your device but it'll also be very quick throughput with the USB 3.1 protocol, capable of up to five gigabit-per-second connections. It also features native DisplayPort 1.2 output for video, as well as HDMI or traditional connections like VGA, through some of those adapter cables that I was talking about earlier. Now as you can tell, this new MacBook is incredibly thin. It's less than half a centimeter thin in fact, at its thinnest point. On this side of the device you'll find your headphone jack as well as microphone, and that's pretty much it for ports. So, opening up the new MacBook the first thing you'll notice is this completely redesigned keyboard. It features these very shallow keys, not a ton of travel, so if you're coming from a previous generation MacBook this is gonna take a little while to get used to. Again this is a consequence of the laptop being so thin. The trackpad has also been changed in order to accommodate this incredibly thin form factor. It now features something called \"force touch\". I know, terrible name! You get the sense of a physical click without actually having a physical click. That sounds very weird, but it's a haptic kind of feedback there, so you get a little buzz that makes you think you clicked down, even when you didn't. It's quite bizarre. The speaker has also been redesigned along the top here. It seems to be shooting more up at you, instead of bouncing down off the table. But probably the biggest development is, this screen. We now have a high-resolution display, in a very thin and light laptop. Coming from the previous generation MacBook Air. That was one of the most requested things and so Apple has finally achieved it, albeit, at a very expensive price point. Now there is a standout missing feature on the new MacBook. It does not include an HD webcam. Instead it's got a 480p front-facing camera here, which doesn't really make a lot sense. Every other MacBook has at least a 720p camera, because 480p it's not cutting it. Nobody likes 480p. You work so hard to fit in this really high resolution panel, and then you gotta look at your own face on it, in 480p? It's just weird. As far as i'm concerned. *laughs* All that said, I still believe that this device is quite the achievement. I can't believe how thin and light laptops are these days, and this display is really amazing. It's essentially as tight a pixel density as you're gonna find. Versus the MacBook Air, there's no doubt that this is a significant improvement. Alright, so that wraps up this unboxing and first look at the brand-new MacBook with Retina display and USB-C, and of course this really cool skin from D-Brand skins. If guys like this look, you wanna check it out or try it out for yourselves, I'll drop a link down in the description as I mentioned earlier. I think it's really slick and it allows for you to customize, put some extra personality into your device. Whether it's a laptop, phone, or whatever. Big props to D-Brand skins! Look at this precision, it's pretty wild. All right guys, that officially wraps up this video, thank you very much for watching! If you enjoyed this content make sure to leave a thumbs up down below! Subscribe if you haven't yet, and I will catch you on the next episode. Later guys. I think you're going to be... 'Think you're gonna like it!",

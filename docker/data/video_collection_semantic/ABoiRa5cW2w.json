    "transcript": "(electronic music) - Jeremy, a big technology that's been emerging in recent years, is Docker. So, in GNS3, we now support Docker Containers. Could you explain kind what this is about versus running, let's say, a VM or something? And why is it cool to have that in GNS3? - So first, Docker Containers are much more lightweight than VMs. - Yeah, yeah. - So you can add lots of Docker Containers to your GNS3 projects. - Yeah. - And, it's also much faster. - Yep. And what I really like about it, I'll say this, is when you drag a Docker Container into your workspace, it connects automatically to internet and it basically installs it. - Yes, in GNS3, we pull the Docker image from the internet, and install it for you. - Yeah. - And so when you drag and drop the Docker container into your project, it will work, like, you don't have to install anything, configure anything, it just starts the Docker Container. It usually boots up in just a few seconds and it's ready to use. - Now, 2.2, great new feature. I've heard a lot of complaints about this. Big issue with Docker containers, you turn it off, you shut down GNS3, you open it up again, everything you've installed is gone. - Yes, it's not persistent. - Persistency, so now we have persistency in GNS3. Persistent, if I can spell that. Persistent yeah? - I think you missed a t. (laughs) - Can't spell today. So, we have persistent containers, sorry persistency of Docker Containers in GNS3 2.2. - Yes. - I'll add another video, either below, I'll link it below this or it'll be further in the course, depending where you're watching this, uh, showing you how to make Docker Containers persistent. I think that's a huge advantage because, I had a lot of complaints on my Python courses where we used an Ubuntu Docker Container and then they would install Python and when they come back tomorrow. - Yes, so now it starts now again and \"Oh where's my Python program? - But now, you by simply, it's a simple edit. You just add like, the folders that you wanna keep persistent, - Yes. - And then it remains. - Yeah, it remains. - So what's the advantage of using a VM over a Docker? Or would you recommend Docker always? - Uh, if you just need a few tools like, to have, uh, Linux shell with some tools like, ping, traceroute et cetera, I will go with Docker, and if you want like, a Windows system or any other advance system, you just run it in a VM. - Yeah, so if you're on a full operating system, - Yah. - If you want the GUI. - Like the GUI, yes, like you run it in a VM. - But yeah, you don't get a Docker Windows Container? - No, there's no Docker in those container. - But you get a Linux Docker Container. - Yeah, yes. - I mean, Dockers more for Linux these days anyway, - Yah. - So if you want like, a simple console, no GUI. - Mm hmm. - And you wanna run Python Scripts, then this is the way to go? - Yeah, that's the way to go, Docker is much more light-weight. - But if you wanna write a Python application with a fancy graphical, user interface and you get the VM? - Yeah. Use the VM, yeah. - The problem with the VM is, it's very resource intensive. - Yeah, so you can't like, have hundreds of VM in your GNS3 project on your computer. - But you could with this? - You could with Docker, yes. - It's very light-weight. - Yeah. - Great, any other comments about Docker and VM's? - No, no, no, it's everything. - That's brilliant. Jeremy, so let me ask you this question, if I wanted to host a Windows VM or something, as part of my GNS3 topology, how would I do that? - Uh, you can either use VMware or VirtualBox. - Yeah. So you got two options, yeah? - Yes, you create your new VM in VMware, you install Windows within it, and then you can import that VM in your GNS3 project and use it like any other node. - So, what's the advantage of one of these? I mean, I suppose the one thing I can think of, if you're running the GNS3 VM in VMware, - Mm hmm. - You can't start up a whole bunch of Virtualbox VM's, 'cause it will crash the CPU or something, is that right? - Uh, yes, there's a conflict between the VMware and Virtualbox. Um, its like around nested virtualization support. You cannot activate nested virtualization support, on both products at the same time. - Yeah so, in other words, this is something that I've come across, I'm running on a Mac. - Mm hmm. - With GNS3 on a Mac and I'm using VMware Fusion. So I have to do my Windows VM's in VMware Fusion? - Yes. - Because otherwise it's gonna crash. - Yeah. - So if you're running, - Oh, yeah. - The GNS3 VM in VMware, you have to use VMware VM's? - Mm hmm. - If you're using Virtualbox then you'd use Virtualbox VM? - Yes, usually it's a good idea to be consistent. - Yeah. So if you're using Virtualbox VM's in your projects, and you're running the GNS3 VM in Virtualbox, it's best to use both products. - Turn it around. Sorry, we've got uh, another member of the team, - A monkey. - Who giving us a hard time here, Mark Blackwell himself. Can you just flip that back, Mark, so we can see ourselves? (laughing) Okay, so VMware, if you be consistent with VMware, - Yes. - Virtualbox, be consistent. - Yeah, exactly, so if you run the GNS3 with VMware, please se GNS3 VM's in your projects and the same applies to Virtualbox. - Okay, now what about this? Because, I know you can run Windows VM's on QEMU. - Uh, you can but its going to be extremely slow, so experience is not going to be great, uh, so that why we recommend VMware or Virtualbox. - Okay so, this option is basically where you've got the GNS3 VM. And then, you're running QEMU, in GNS3. So actually, QEMU on Linux. - Yes. - And then you're running Windows inside QEMU, inside Linux, within the GNS3 VM, running within a virtualization technology, like VMware. - Yeah. - So you're nesting, nesting, nesting, nesting. - Yes, and yeah it's going to be, - Slow. - Very slow, yes. - So, then you would recommend these two options. - Yeah, VMware or Virtualbox for your Windows host or Mac OS host or, - Yah, I mean, and that's been my experience. I did Kali Linux and tried to do it this way, even with just Linux, - Yeah. - And its a bit slow, it seems to be easier sometimes if you've got big devices or devices that are gonna be processor intensive, to use it this way. - Yeah. - That's great, I mean, would you recommend one over the other or is it just depending what you're using the VM with? - Uh, I usually prefer to use VMware, 'cause they have a better product. - Yeah. - I think they are slightly faster than Virtualbox. But Virtualbox will be totally fine to use, and it's free, that's one of the big advantage. - Yeah, that's great. So Jeremy, thanks very much, for sharing about the different appliances. If I've missed any or there's any that you have questions about, let me know and I'll create some videos about that. Jeremy, thanks very much. - You're welcome. (electronic music)",

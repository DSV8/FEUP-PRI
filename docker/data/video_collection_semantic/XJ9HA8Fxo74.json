    "transcript": "- Today is day two of the David Bombal Christmas Giveaway. Are you ready to win some prizes? (upbeat music) This is the time of year when I have the opportunity to say thank you. I just want to say thank you for everything, thank you so much for supporting me, thank you so much for purchasing my courses, liking my videos, being subscribed to you YouTube channel, just want to say thank you. Without you, none of this would be possible. So again, thank you for a fantastic 2019. But I don't want to lead this conversation, I'm gonna hand the video over to David in South Africa. - Now I said you have to be quick with some of these giveaways. So the first 20 people that use this link, will win access to my Python for Network Engineers Course. First 20 people that use this link get free access to my Python for Network Engineers Course. This course teaches you how to use Python for network automation and network programmability. It's a great start it you want to learn how to automate networks using Python. Now I've specifically made this course very practical rather than just teaching you the theory of Python, I actually show you how to configure network devices using Python. So, from the very beginning, you'll know how to configure network devices using protocols such as Telnet and SSH. I start with Telnet just to keep it simple, but we very quickly migrate to using SSH and libraries such as NAPALM to make it easy for you to automate network devices. The days of manually configuring network devices using the CLI are over, you now need to learn how to configure network devices using Python, as well as applications such as Ansible. But in this course, it's specifically a Python course, I teach you the basics of Python. Later on in the course, but initially, I get you to configure network devices practically using Python. So, first 20 people that use this link will win access to my Python for Network Engineers Course. I hope it helps you in your journey, learning network automation. But not only that, I've also got some great prizes from Boson. Boson have kindly sponsored a whole bunch of their ExSim software, as well as their network simulator software. If you're preparing for exams, such as CCNA, or CCH, or CISSP, or Microsoft exams, or CompTIA exams, the Boson software is fantastic preparation software. Have a look on Reddit and other places to see the feedback from users of this software. So don't just take my word for it, have a look at what others are saying. But let me tell you, this is great software, great product from Boson. Now for today's giveaway, I'm giving away one cope of the Boson ExSim for the CISSP Exam. So one person will win access to the Boson ExSim software for the CISSP Exam. If you're studying for your CISSP, this software will help you pass that exam. Two people will get access to the BOSON NetSim Software, once again, fantastic software for preparing for the CCNA Exam. This software can really help you pass the exam but giving you the confidence and the ability to pass the simulations on the CCNA exam. And one person is gonna get access to the Boson ExSim software for the CCNA exam. This, once again, will help you pass your CCNA. Now if you're interested in winning, use the link below, hopefully you'll be the winner of the Boson software. But if you're not, I've added another link below where you can get a 25% discount on the Boson software. Another great thing about the Boson software is they will give you a free upgrade on the CCNA software. The CCNA is changing in February, it's not that long, but the good thing is if you don't manage to take the exam by the February change of date, or you don't pass, Boson will give you a free upgrade on both the NetSim software, as well as the ExSim software for the Cisco CCNA. So, fantastic benefit from Boson. Now, tell me, what are some of the lessons that you've learned in 2019? There's no such thing as a failure. If you stumble and fall, as long as you learn something, you can change your life later. So what did you learn in 2019? Which lessons did you learn that you need to apply in 2020? Now if you've managed to get this far in the video, here's an extra bonus. First 20 people that use this link will get access to my CCNA Packet Tracer Labs Course. This is a practical course that consists of a whole bunch of labs that helps you prepare for the CCNA exam. I've had a lot of feedback from many people who have used this course, and they found it invaluable in their studies. So if you're studying for the CCNA exam, this course can really help you. Use this link once again if you want to win access to my CCNA Packet Tracer Labs Course. Please note that only the first 20 people get free access, but you can use the link below to get the course at a discount. Now from a very beautiful and sunny South Africa, I once again want to wish you all the very best over the festive season, and all the very best in 2020. Go and make a success of your life.

    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine, and welcome back to my kitchen. I know a lot you guys have missed by baking videos so today I thought that I would try to recreate an old classic. I once tried to make a pumpkin pie and so many things went wrong, that I watched this video, I studied it, and I figured out all the things that I did wrong, I made myself a mental list. And now, we're gonna remake this pumpkin pie. Today I'm using the Amazon Fire TV Cube in my kitchen, so right now I can see the television right here, so I can have side by side, what I'm doing and re-watching the old video that I made before so I won't make the same mistakes. First thing's first, Alexa, turn on my TV. This is great, hands free. I basically have Alexa at my finger tips. Alexa, what's the weather today? - [Alexa] Right now in Santa Monica, it's 72 degrees Fahrenheit with cloudy skies. Today's forecast has intermittent clouds with a high of 72 degrees and a low of 53. - It doesn't even matter because I'm inside baking a freaking pumpkin pie so let's get started. Thanks to Amazon Fire TV for sponsoring this video. The Amazon Fire TV Cube has Alexa built in, so you can control smart home devices, watch all of your favorite streaming apps, movies, TV shows, and have the convenience of controlling your TV hands free. You can launch and control content from streaming as well as live cable or satellite channels with just your voice. Check out the link in the description for more info. My favorite thing, though, is you can have her control your lights. I actually have these lights set up in my house, they are controlled by Hue and that's also connected to my Alexa app. So all I have to say is, Alexa, turn off all my lights. But since I'm shooting a video, I kinda want those on, so, Alexa, turn on my lights. All right, time to bake a pumpkin pie! So first of all, I need to figure out what ingredients I need. So I'm gonna get all of those, I'm gonna lay them out, and then I'm gonna start playing the old video up on the television so that I can see (sighs) what the first mistake was. Three fourth cup granulated sugar, one tsp of salt, one tsp of ground cinnamon, one tsp ground ginger, (yells) one tsp of ground cloves. We need two eggs and I just realized, I think my eggs are expired. I need an emergency egg-straction. Eggs? I don't have a pun for that, so I'm just gonna call Jenna, I need help. - [Tyler] It's an egg-mergency. Egg-mergency, it is an egg, oh my gosh, this is, Tyler, you're brilliant, okay. - [Jenna] Hello? - I'm having an egg-mergency, can you please bring me two large eggs? - [Jenna] (laughs) Yes. - Oh my gosh, thank you so much. - [Jenna] Bye. - Bye. - This is egg-xcellent news. - Egg-xcellent, they're all so egg-xcel! - I can't eat this yet! - I can't believe that I didn't know that you weren't supposed to put crusts on top of pumpkin pie. - You're not a true pumpkin pie fan. Call me when it's done. - Okay. Alexa, play \"iJustine Pumpkin Pie Mistakes\" on YouTube. - [Alexa] Getting that from YouTube. - Hey, guys, how's it going, it's Justine. And today we are in my kitchen and we are making a freaking pumpkin pie. - [Justine] Yes, yes! - And I'm so excited because I love pumpkin pie. Now I've never made one before-- - Okay, so what have I got going on here? Okay, we've got all of our ingredients. Over here I've got my pan, same pan. Eggs. (humming) Okay, everything looks the same. Alexa, play. - Blender, obviously. There's also a problem because I realized I don't have ground ginger. (gasp) I don't have ground cloves. - I have all those things this time. It is go time, the time is to go is now. Will say, the far field of communication on this thing is pretty incredible 'cause like I'm not close but I'm definitely kind of far away and I'm not even talking that loud. First step, we're gonna put all of the things into the thing. Mix salt, sugar, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves in a small bowl. Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Stir in pumpkin and sugar spice mixture... (mumbling) Okay. I think I've already started making mistakes by not following the directions. (laughs) I mean, honestly, you just put everything in. Like you just put it all in, you mix it all together. (egg crashing) Oh, shoot, I need, okay. I remember I had this problem last year. Can opener, I didn't have one, so I had to Amazon it. - [Tyler] Do you know the blow hole trick for cans of things? - What, a blow hole? - [Tyler] Yeah, you blow in the hole. You cut the top of the can off. - You cut it. - [Tyler] You use the can opener. - Oh, okay. - [Tyler] You cut the top off and then you flip it over and you take the can opener and you just make a punch hole and then you blow in the hole and it all comes out in a perfect cylinder. - We're gonna do that. Oh, this is fun! Okay, so... (opening can) Oh, oh, I think I'm doing something. Oh, I think I broke the, Well, it's a slit. - [Tyler] Yeah, that's good. - Okay so I-- - [Tyler] Then you just blow on it. - Oh! (laughs) Happy Thanksgiving! Wow! Alexa, play me a song that you think I would like. - [Alexa] Here's a station you might like. Prime Pop on Amazon Music. - This is honestly what I needed to hear right now. Taylor Swift telling me to calm down? My savior. Okay, so I put all my stuff in except all the dry ingredients, I'm just gonna put them all in at the same time I think. I have to preheat, 425 for 15 minutes. Well, I'm not ready there yet, 'cause this is clearly taking way too long. (jazzy music) (blender whirring) Oh. (blender whirring) I think that's good enough. Oh my god, I thought it was gonna stop. How do I get you to stop? Okay, I'm gonna preheat the oven now, because, because. I don't know when the last time was I cleaned my oven. I don't think I ever have. I'm gonna clean up my mess, I'm gonna set my mixture aside, prepare the crust, pour this in, things are happening, guys. Things are happening. I'm gonna play myself a little cleanup song. Alexa, play \"The Clean Up Song\" on YouTube. - [Alexa] \"The Clean Up Song\" by The Kiboomers. - Have you guys ever heard this song? Time to clean up We had a lot of fun Now that we're done I need to be put away. Everything's clean! Alexa, pause. Let's go back to my video and make sure I don't make a mistake here again. The one mistake that I definitely know that I made was that last time I put crust on top of the pumpkin pie. Who knew that you weren't supposed to do that? Oh that's right, everybody knew except me. Alexa, fast forward one minute. - Making a freaking pump-- Whee! - Alexa, pause. Okay. So at this point, this is where we'd be playing. Alexa, play \"Rollout\". - [Alexa] Getting that from YouTube. Rollout I got my twin glock forties Rollout Me and my homies Rollout Alexa, pause. Okay so we're putting our pie crust in. I'm just kind of like molding it a little up here just to be, you know, like a little more pie like. Okay, let's pour in this mixture. Wow! Oh my god, this smells incredible. This smells so good. The consistency looks better. Yeah, I mean before, it was really soupy. This looks a little less soupy. Let's see here, we are going to be baking this for 40 to 50 minutes or until knife inserted in your center comes out clean. I have to cool it on a wire rack for two hours? I forgot about that. All right, so I guess I'll see you in like 50 minutes and then two hours after that. It's no big deal, I didn't wanna eat this immediately or anything. All right. Alexa, set a timer for 45 minutes. Alexa, can you add to my shopping list to get some eggs? - [Alexa] I added eggs to your shopping list. - Alexa, can you order me a new hat on Amazon? - [Alexa] One moment. Based on your order history, I found TAGVO LED Light Up Hat Beanie Knit Cap, Amazon's Choices Lisianthus Women Belt Buckle Fedora. - Oh, that's nice. - [Alexa] Carhartt Black Hat. - [Justine] Oh, oh! - [Alexa] And 17 more. - 17. Alexa, order that one. - Order placed. Your total is $16.41 including tax and your gift card was applied and will be delivered by October-- - (gasps) I just want you to know this is the first time I ever did that. This is incredible. Amazon knows me so well. Like I know this is a sponsored video, but if you guys know me, like I don't even go shopping anymore, like I don't go to the grocery store. Like I have Amazon Prime delivered to me. Like I can order things within 15 minutes. (whispering) Oh my god. Alexa, how much time is left on my timer? - [Alexa] You have two timers. A 15 minutes timer with about 12 minutes left and a 45 minutes timer with about 42 minutes left. - Okay, well I guess now we just wait. Oh, oh, whoa, oh boy! Oh my gosh, my 15 minutes timer has finished. My 15 mins, 15 mins, which means I need to check my pie! Okay, it is definitely not ready to be at all taken out. 'Cause it's only been in the oven for 15 minutes. So we'll see you when the next timer happens. Ooh, timer's going off! That means it's ready! Oh man, this looks like a freaking fantastic delight. But now I'm gonna have to wait two hours because that's what the directions say and I'm not gonna mess it up. I'll see you soon. - [Alexa] Calling Jenna Ezarik's Alexa devices. - (gasp) Jenna! - Is it time for pie? - It is time for pie, so I'm calling you on my Echo. It's still a little warm, but it's almost cooled off. - Oh, it looks lovely. Do you have any whipped cream? - No! - (laughs) That's okay! - I didn't know that whipped cream is something that you put on... Wait a minute, oh my god. She's... - Look, I got here very quickly, 'cause I heard there was pie. - What do you think so far? - It looks really good and it smells incredible. - It's still a little bit warm, which is great, because this is gonna be, oh my god, look at this. Everything looks perfect. - I love pumpkin pie. - I guess we cut it now. Ooh, oh, it's real warm. Maybe I needed to let it cool a little longer. (gasp) But I didn't wanna wait anymore. I just feel like warm pumpkin pie, there's nothing better. Ready? I feel accomplished. - (whispers) This is way better. - You have to say that louder because the microphone's here. - This is way better than what you've done before. - Yeah, you gotta let me hear that. - I was like, I remember coming in last time, I'm like, \"Ooh.\" - Oh my gosh, oh my gosh. - This is good. - You're right, it does need whipped cream. I forgot, I can't believe it. Well-- - Maybe next year, you'll finally get it right. - This is so good. - It's incredible. - I do like the crust as well. - It's incredible. This is the best pumpkin pie. Like I wanna stop eating it so I can let it cool, but then I'm almost done. Good job, Jus. - That was the name that I wanted to name my show, Good Job, Jus, I do things and I do them hopefully right. This is the first episode. Well, guys, thank you so much for watching and I'm so excited to have a new Amazon addition to my kitchen, the Amazon Fire TV Cube, so I can do things like this. Alexa, play Jenna Ezarik videos on YouTube. - [Jenna] Oh boy. - [Alexa] Getting that from YouTube. - What's up, guys, welcome to a new baking video. I'm really excited for this video. - [Justine] Oh, look who it is, it's us. - It got a million views. - Good job, wow. - We are not baking at all, actually. - Well it's like a baking theme. - Well, I finished my pie. I'll see you guys in the next video. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to see me make here on YouTube. Leave me some comments below. Oh, this is good. Oh, I'm very full. No no no no no no no, this is mine. (jazzy music)",

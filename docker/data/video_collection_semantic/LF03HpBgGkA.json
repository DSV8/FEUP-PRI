    "description": "The Galaxy Note 7 had some explosive issues. Which is super unfortunate because there were an estimated 2.5 million devices sold. Luckily Samsung did do a recall and offered full refunds to anyone who had purchased one of the defective units. Also... I don't actually live with my mom. I was prepared for the fire ;-)  As of today 96% of the Note 7 smartphones have been returned.

    "transcript": "Samsung sold an estimated 2.5 million Note 7 devices. And at this stage in the game, about 96% of them have been returned. Thats what they said 2 days ago anyway. But how do you ship exploding phones? And is it safe? Lets find out. [Intro] Its crazy that 96% of people have returned their Note 7. That part is impressive. Its crazy that 4% of people have not returned their Note 7. They are walking around with a phone that could hurt them and theres even a fine if you fly on an airline in the United States with a Note 7 of 180,000 dollars. I can think of a couple more things that I would rather be spending that money on. So this is the box that Samsung sends you when its time to return your Note 7. And in the box theres this little note right here, and I think its cool that they say that: Safety is our highest priority. We realize that we did not meet the standards of excellence that youd expect and deserve with the Note 7. For that, we sincerely apologize. Thats really cool. They also go on to explain a little bit about whats inside of the box and Im going to show you that right now. So inside of this first boxwe have box number 1. And inside of that box we have a couple more instructions; these ones are visual. We have some tape to seal the box after were done. We have a plastic bag to put the Note 7 in before we put it in the box. And we have these gloves. And why would we have rubber gloves when we ship a Note 7? Its because of this white stuff right here. So this white stuff, which is what were going to be testing in a second, is called ceramic paper. Normally ceramic is resistant to heat to about 1,000 to 1,600 degrees Celsius. So it should stand up to normal flames. Inside this white coated box we have one more box. And inside of this box we have, you could probably guess it, one more box. So its kind of like the Russian doll of boxes hereor box Inception. This is the last box and this is where your actual Note 7 goes. So you take your Note 7, put it in this bag. Put this bag in the box. Close that. Put it in this box. And put those boxes in this box. And this is the box that were actually interested in, with the ceramic paper in it. So this box was made by a company called Americase here in the United States. Its got a couple warnings on there for the shipping because this is the actual box that goes to the carrier for it. It cant fly in any airlines, its only ground shipping. Americase does make an even bigger box that can hold up to 9 phones at a time, and this is what the retailers get like T-Mobile and Verizon and AT&T, the ones who are sending it back to Samsung in bulk. And it also has the same type of ceramic paper around the inside; it just has more compartments for cell phones. But this is the box you would get if youre a civilian. So if you remember from my Galaxy Note 7 Explosion video, the one I manually exploded, the flame lasted for about 30 seconds or so. So were going to see if this box can handle 30 seconds worth of flame. [Music playing] So right now this is direct flame right on top of this ceramic paper and its turning black, but its not starting on fire which is good when youre shipping exploding phones. Right now the hottest thing in this box is my thumb from holding this lighter. [Music playing] I would successfully say that this box can withstand a Note 7 starting on fire, because its not necessarily an explosion, its more of just, you know, constant flame coming out of the device. Theres a little bit of smoke and black stuff but its not going to keep on burning. So weve seen what happens with the boxes that are specifically designed for the recalled Note 7. Lets say the box was accidentally shipped in a regular, like Amazon box, like this one. If the phone was shipped in a regular Amazon box, the minute that the phone starts on fire, the box would also start on fire. And this is not super convenient for the shipper like FedEx or UPS, who is in charge of shipping this thing. I think Ive made a very big mistake. [Awkward silence] Mom!.... [Panic] MOM!?!.... So airlines are not required anymore to give that spiel about the Note 7s being illegal to fly with, probably because most people have returned their phones by now. And super huge thumbs up to Samsung for owning up to their mistake and allowing these phones to be returned as quickly and safely as possible. Im pretty impressed with the box thats been designed to return those Note 7s. Did you have a good experience or a bad experience returning your Note 7? Let me know down in the comments. Give this video a thumbs up. Thanks a ton for watching and Ill see you around.",

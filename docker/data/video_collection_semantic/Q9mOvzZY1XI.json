    "transcript": "- Today, I am building and giving away a $10,000 ultimate gaming PC sponsored by our friends at Micro Center. The catch? Well, I have to earn my budget by dressing up as Linus and giving away mixtapes at the beach. Don't ask questions. I don't think it makes sense either. This might be top five most embarrassing things I've ever done for a video. I deeply regret this decision in every possible way right now. Hey, excuse me. Hey, I have a quick question for you. Do you ever watch any YouTube videos? - No. - No, you don't watch YouTube? Oh, okay. No worries. Excuse me, do you ever watch any YouTube? - All the time. - Oh, do you? Do you ever watch any like tech videos? - Any what? - Any like tech, like technology videos on like phones and computers and that kinda stuff? - Eh, not really. I got a computer science degree. I didn't really need it. - All right, no worries. Have a good one. I'm going to walk into the ocean now. Quick question for you. Do you ever watch any like tech YouTube videos, by chance? - YouTube? - Yeah. - Nope. - No, not really? No worries. Have a good one. After being here for a while, I've given away exactly zero CDs. So I think my tactics need to be a little bit more aggressive. Excuse me, have you ever heard of Linus Tech Tips? - Tips? - Linus Tech Tips? - My English not good, sorry. - Oh, no worries. He makes really cool tech YouTube videos. I have a bunch of CDs, if you ever wanna check 'em out. - I'm good, thank you. - You're all good? Okay, no worries. Well, have a good one. - All right, thank you. - Thank you. There's something about getting people to click on videos is much easier than taking physical CDs. You won't believe this. Right after we stopped filming, 10 different people came up to me, and they're all like, \"Oh my god, are you Linus Tech Tips?\" So I gave them each a CD, and we're all set. So it's time to go to Micro Center. Hello, my friends, and welcome to Micro Center. With my $10,000 budget in hand, I will now have 10 minutes to spend said budget. Count me down. - Go! - I said count. Okay, that's fine. That's fine. That's fine. That's fine. Okay, so the first thing I'm gonna do is start with the case. This is the biggest budget I've ever had at Micro Center. So I wanna get something big and impressive, my motto in life. Should I do a 7000D? If you can lift this PC at the end, then it's all yours. Okay, so if we're gonna go ultimate for gaming, I wanna do a 12900KS. It's locked. - Well, if you want it unlocked, you have to do your ad read. Jared, how much time does he have left? - Gimme the key! Please! - That's for me to know, and for the audience to find out. - Well. - I need the key! - Well, Austin. - So if you would like to get your hands on a high-quality deal for new customers only, you can get yourself an i7 11700K in store only. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. You're not a new customer. - Not for me, for you, dear viewer, who hasn't come to Micro Center yet for some weird reason. And if you use the coupon code, you can also get it in a motherboard bundle. So check out the link in the description, which you'll find is Micro Center has a wonderful site all about showing off your personal PC build. And if you submit your build to the showcase, you might get yourself a little bit of money off next time you visit Micro Center in store. Maximus. Godlike, yes! I don't think it literally gets more high end than an $1,100 board with 10 gig ethernet. So a 3090 Ti, I mean, honestly, nothing's gonna beat this. How am I doing all my time? I'm good, right? - You have about minutes left. - What do you mean minutes left? We've got 64 gigs of Crucial. We'll add that here. You think that I've done enough videos in Micro Center that I would know everything perfectly, but I still get confused sometimes. I think I want a 1,200-watt Thor power supply. That's what I want, yeah. So this is the Elite LCD, with the screen, it's gonna look really nice. - Austin, you have less than a minute. And you need your monitors. - And my peripherals! No! Move briskly. Moving briskly, moving briskly. Monitors in the back, okay. Why is the camera here? UltraGear, here. Hold this, hold this, hold this, hold this. - Seven, six, five. - On the cart, it counts. - Four, three. If it's on the cart, it counts out. Ow. It's on, it's counts. - Two, one. It's counts, it counts! - That's 10 minutes. - It counts! - You're just barely on the cart. - Everything's touching! - Nothing is. - Everything's touching! - Actually on the box, which is on the cart. Therefore, it counts. - Nope, it's not on the car anymore. - We have to give this away. - That landed on my foot. It landed on my foot. - Oh, boo-hoo. - No pain, no gain. - Austin, never hurt in a day of his life, Evans. - Okay, Austin, this was the easy part. - What is the easy part? - Well, just wait till we get back to the studio. - Have you ever done a build drunk? - You know, I actually can't say that I have. Are these drunk goggles? - Yes, they are. And they simulate what it's like to have your blood alcohol level at 0.25%. - That's quite drunk. - Very drunk. - What? Dude? - You now have 30 minutes. - What? - To get as much done as you can before we upgrade you to the blackout drunk goggles. - What, how bad are the blackout goggles? - Oh, well, how about we just try not to find out. - In hindsight, having him operate the knife with the... - Ooh, you know, that's probably not the greatest idea. - Yeah, you okay? - Yep. Oh, oh. - What? - Oh, that's kinda cool. Wow. - It's magnet. What? - Wow, you almost have 20 minutes left. - I spent 10 minutes, and I haven't done anything yet? - Yeah. - That's unfortunate, okay. This is a real problem 'cause this all looks like absolute nonsense to me. I'm gonna open up my board first. What is that? What? All right, I see a socket. Is there a CPU around here? That's not a CPU. - Where could it be? You must have placed it somewhere on accident in your drunken state. - I hear excuses over here. Ah, is that a CPU? I see a blue box. Yeah, it is! You can't fool me! You can't fool me! - Don't touch the lens, dude. - Oh, do you have the drunk goggles on? - I have the drunker goggles. Oh, Jesus Christ. - Okay, I'm gonna go in for the insertion. Wow, okay. Going in for the insertion. I'd like to formally apologize to the winner of this PC. If anything is incorrect, you can blame Ken. - Austin, that's not in the socket at all, dude. - That's right. - No, it's not. - Oh, geeze. - Is it not? It looks fine to me. - No! - Oh, it is so off, dude! Oh my god. - Am I in trouble right now? I feel like I could build a better PC if I was actually drunk. It's dark in here. And there's also two motherboards in front of me, so. Yes, they have the tool-less, excellent. Okay, there we go, that felt good. Okay, that's in. This fan isn't mounting right, and I don't quite understand why. - You just better hope whoever we give this to never watches this video. You hear that, Mr., very interest in what he is doing, Evans? - Aah! - It's time to drink. - Ugh. - Don't get used to sober world. Put the new ones back on. - So these are 0.26 to 0.35 totally wasted. What? Wait, actually there's more distortion, but it's actually more uniform. - This is where we find out that Austin has had terrible vision his entire life. And that this is just corrective vision. - Oh. I'm not gonna let this PC build defeat me. I cannot see anything. I've just gotta feel until I land in the right spot. Oh, that's it, that's it. It's in, I've got it in. - Are you sure it's in? - Yeah. - Are you gonna, oh, you have a lot of faith in that. It's fantastic. Oh. - Oh, okay, I don't think it was in. Yeah? - No. - What is, okay, can you please describe to me what's going on? 'Cause it looks like I'm putting it in right. Why is this not going in? So after a quick BIOS update and Jared spending a few hours buttoning up the PC, it's done! So now the challenge is going to be something that I've wanted to do for, no joke, all of my adult life. Do you ever watch the show, \"Whose Line Is It Anyway\"? You remember Ryan and Colin used to do the thing where he would put the hands through and you have to do like the eating and stuff. Let us actually play a game of \"Forza,\" but with a twist. Ken, be my eyes. - That sounds terrible and slightly privileged. You do realize that there is a portion of the internet that's been waiting for this for like literally years. So how do you wanna do this? What's the coms? - We're, I will tell you, I'll be like your rally driver. - Okay, I'm gonna hit B. - Okay, so you're already in the game. So you're going down a volcano. - Oh, shoot. What? Volcano? - Yeah, yeah, it's the beginning of \"Forza.\" Left, left, left, that's a rock. - You couldn't start us on the road, buddy? - Punch it. Left, left, left, Ken, left! Okay, okay, this is very bad. - Are you giving me some counter-steering? - No, no, you just broke your Bronco. This is very difficult. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, get 'em, get 'em, get 'em. Touch right, touch right, touch right, touch right. There you go, straighten, there you go. Punch it, full throttle, full throttle! - I am full throttle. - Go all the way off, and we're flying! We're flying! - Wait, it really work? - Yeah, we're making it, making it. - Oh, okay. - We're falling down. Hey, don't cheat. Right, right. - Oh, this is weird, this is weird. Okay, straight, a little bit right. A little bit, little bit, little bit, little bit, little bit, more, more, more, more. Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard. Left, left, left, left, let's go! Right, hard right. I did not, wait, where's the road? Oh, there's the road. - Trails, get me in! We've successfully made sure that this extremely high-end PC functions with a thorough gaming test. You won't believe what happens next! Keep watching. Otherwise our retention will be low, and people will say that it's fake. - I didn't do this, just wanna put that on the record. This was like this when I got here. - Wow. - So just know. - Jared, you show up to the Micro Center, and you immediately break everything in sight. - No, I would never do such a thing. - So right now we are setting up to do the most important part of this entire video, which is to give it away. So the thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna tell people, \"Come to Micro Center right now and tell me the password, which is roboraptor.\" There's a lot of people on Twitter trying to book flights at the moment. - I know. - A questionable idea. - I'm kinda nervous. - I'm kinda nervous too. What if no one shows up? - Maybe we hide you. Maybe they really gotta put in a search. - I feel really silly right now. - Duck. - I love it. - Social security number. - Yeah. Big Yoshi. - Courtney said he's on the way. If Courtney shows up, yeah. - Courtney. - What's good? - Roboraptor. - Oh my god, you did it! Let's go! - Dude, okay, that was like five minutes. - Four minutes. After five minutes, Eric is here. So couple questions for you. Have you ever built a PC before? - I'm in the middle of building one right now. - You're building your first PC right now? - Yeah. - Well, what if I could tell you that you could skip the whole process and just have a fully built PC ready to go? - I might cry. - Okay, so the rules are really simple. You're gonna have three minutes to fix this PC. So we built this PC already, but we have selectively sabotaged a couple of things. I can tell you, three things on the system will keep it from posting. All you need to do is hit that power button and get something up on the screen. You ready? - Yeah. - Okay, all right, so. Jared, do you have the timer? - Yep. - Okay. - Alrighty, two minutes in three- - Wait, did I say two or three minutes? I thought I said three. - All right, three minutes in three, two, one, go! - Okay, go for it. - Oh, all right. - So take a look, do a little trouble shooting. Did you just plug the display cable in? - I just got it. - Okay, that's number one. - Got it. - He already got that. Okay, so you got one thing. There's two things left on it. - Mm-hmm. I would think maybe RAM. - Okay. - 'Cause it's unseated maybe. - Look a little loose? - Yeah, it does look a little loose. - Uh-oh. You've seriously never built a PC before? - I watched so many videos on it. All right, can I get it back in? - You can do it, you can do it, you can do it. - Gimme the click. - You have a minute and 40 seconds. - Halfway there. Yeah, more, more, more. There you go, there you go. Okay, okay, the RAM is in, that's number two. I can't help you or anything, but I'm gonna stand toward the back for some reason. - One minute, one minute. - Is the monitor on? - Monitor's on. It's not the monitor. Definitely the PC. - Ah. - Oh, did it! - All right. - Do, do, do, do it! Yes, you did it! What's the time, what's the time? - It was 40 seconds left. - Jesus. - Congratulations, my friend. This is your brand new gaming PC. - Oh, wow. That's so cool. My girlfriend's not gonna believe this. - And this is your first gaming PC built. - Thank you so much. - Dude, of course, man. Bring it in, dude. Do you have room in your car? - I do, I do, I do. - Okay. - That's the real worry. - Huge thank you to Micro Center for sponsoring this video. If you wanna get not only the greatest deals, but you never know, when you show up to Tustin Micro Center, definitely be sure to go check out the link in the description. - Would you like to go play on your PC now? - 100%.",

    "description": "Deepcool's AIO anti-leak technology has been around for the better part of a year but they're already bringing out their second generation devices.  They have smaller radiator footprints for better compatibility and other new or enhanced features.    A special thanks to Phanteks and Steelseries for sponsoring our trip to Computex 2019.  In addition Deepcool is a minor sponsor, providing some support for transport and meals.

    "transcript": "so we start by Deepcool to check out something interesting that they've been cooking for a while particularly in the cooling segment they're calling it the anti leak tech and yes as the term suggests this technology is supposed to significantly improve their AIO's operation by allowing it to achieve an automated pressure balance and improve longevity on liquid cooling let's get into how it works but first huge thanks to our sponsors pantex and Steel series because without them Computex 2019 would not have been possible now when you look at a typical a a cooler the coolant plays an important role when it comes to cooling the processor now the pump design is also very crucial and as the coolant temperature increases the pressure within the AIO also increases and over time this expansion and contraction can cause or could cause certain components to leak Deepcool who has somehow figured out a way to implement an elastic pressure relief bag with one sized exposed to the air and the other inside the coolant so when the internal pressure increases the air inside the bag gets pushed out creating more area within the AIO and this decreases pressure think of it like a lung exhaling air the capsule itself is made out of a specialized rubber material that's also heat and corrosion resistant and Deepcool also claims that the material itself wouldn't deform over the temperature variances and I do have this you know really interesting mock-up sample of the actual Anti Lake tech as you can see that's the rubberized capsule hopefully this hopefully this camera focuses right or autofocus is right and then you've also got the release point right over there so you know even though this isn't he working sample I think it's pretty cool tech now with the implementation of this new anti leak tech does it automatically result in better CPU temperatures not necessarily because Deepcool is really gearing for or targeting towards the AIO's longevity over you know cooling performance and while they are considering achieving both those you know it's really interesting to see they're taking a longevity as one of their highlights for their new a aya coolers and I'm hoping that you know I'll be able to test this out to keep you guys sort of my long-term experience with their products now unfortunately adding this rubber caps you'll insert causes the radiator size to increased by a bit the vehicle did mention that they've tested compatibility with most ATX cases but I highly this would fit a micro ATX case moving on to the new coolers they announced the Castle EX series and as you can see it looks very familiar to their previous Castle two models but now they've included the anti lick technology the logo chip is now swappable and customizable and you can do that by twisting the cap and taking off the circular insert Deepcool does including normal one with their logo as well as a plain option so users can attach stickers or anything you'll also notice the subtle ring lining around the pump that looks really cool and it features addressable RGB lighting the pump design now features a dual chamber system that allows for a better flow and they've increased the size of these skype fins behind the copper core plate by 25% the included fans have also been revised so first and foremost they're not RGB thank you Deepcool cuz personally I didn't like the ones on the original Castle cooler the blades on the new fan are more efficient and exhausting hot air plus they've built these subtle vents around the corners that improve acoustic performance there'll be two models of the Castle ax series so you get the 240 millimeter and 360 moment option and pricing is $120 and $160 respectively and you can pick up these models right now the captain series of coolers are receiving a slight upgrade as well so instead of the glass pipe design going into the pump they replaced it with a metal one which they claims should dissipate heat a bit better it also comes with the anti Lake technology and you get both 240 and 360 moment options pricing starts at $105 and 134 or 135 dollars respectively they're also offering white models for a few extra dollars on both sizes so that about wraps up our coverage here at Deepcool let me know what you guys think about the new anti Lake tech that Deepcool has integrated within their new AIO coolers is this something that you would consider you know looking into I certainly am pretty interested in testing this new whole tech but yeah let me know what you guys think I'm Eva with Hardware Canucks thank you so much for watching make sure to check out some relevant content over here subscribe to our boot sequence channel for the latest tech news and updates I'll see you guys in the next one",

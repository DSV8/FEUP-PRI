Grab a JerryRigKnife here:  Have you ever accidentally put your tool in the wrong hole? Today we find out if there is anything to worry about. And don't worry! It happens to everyone. Those holes are very close together. Lucky for us, smartphone designers appear to be on top of their game, and have anticipated a poke happy populous.

    "transcript": "I'm making this video for two reasons. One, I forgot to show you the uniquely positioned vibrator inside of the S22 Ultra. And two, one question I get surprisingly often is what happens if I were to accidentally put my SIM card removal tool into the microphone opening? It's a valid question. Will the SIM card tool damage the microphone, or worse, the water resistance? Today we're going to find out what happens when we put it in the wrong hole. It should be interesting. Let's get started. [Intro] Before we stab all of these phones in the microphone hole, let's find that S22 Ultra vibrator. If you remember in my S22 Ultra teardown video I don't mention the vibrator at all and that's because it's not visible. Out of sight, out of mind. I just plumb forgot it's existence. It turns out though there is a vibrator and it's hidden, for some reason, inside the lower loudspeaker. I just gotta drain the balls first. These little guys provide more surface area for the sound inside the speaker to reverberate off of, making the speaker sound bigger than it actually is. Car auto enthusiasts have been stuffing subwoofer boxes for ages to get this same effect. And apparently, another interesting and very creative trick to making the speaker box bigger is to actually throw an entire vibrator inside. I'm not going to pretend to understand the intricacies of what this accomplishes acoustically since it looks like it occupies all the additional space it creates inside that loudspeaker enclosure. Of course there are air pockets inside of the vibrator which would give a spot for the sound to bounce off of. We can try to break open the laser welded enclosure to see what it looks like from the inside. Opening like a can of sardines, this guy is an x-axis haptic vibrator, which means it can provide very specific vibrations, differentiating between different tasks like keyboard presses or phone calls. It's very different to open. But with the lid now sliced and lifted you can see the copper coils of the motor that would allow the innards to get wiggly jiggly if I didn't crush the mcjibblets out of it. It's a cool concept though so if you own an S22 Ultra, let us know down in the comments if the speaker or vibrator works any better with this new symbiotic relationship. It's definitely not a match I would have predicted, but it is 2022 and anything can happen. Now let's find out what happens when we put the SIM card tool into the wrong hole. Since Samsung has very dangerously both holes right next to each other, if you're not paying attention a tool could very easily slide into the wrong one. If you notice with the bottom board removed, even though the microphone hole is big enough to accept the SIM card tool, all of the fragile components are positioned off to the side of the shaft, like the waterproofing screen. It's resting on the roof of the shaft instead of at the end, placed in a way that would be impossible to puncture. Plus it looks like the shaft even narrows before it gets to the waterproofing so the tool does stop before it even gets to this point. The gold square of a microphone is also positioned above the shaft, so again there's a zero percent chance of it getting nicked during any accidental pokes. The S22 Ultra is safe. Let's take a look at the OnePlus 10 Pro since it also has the microphone hole positioned right next to the SIM card tray. One of the problems with designing products for the general public is that the general public is very, you know, diverse. For example a forest ranger at Yosemite once said that it's hard to make a bear-proof trash can because there is considerable overlap between the intelligence of the smartest bears and the dumbest tourists. Now obviously if you put your SIM card tool in the wrong hole you're not dumb. The holes are literally right next to each other and the same size, so it's very easy to confuse the two. We just hope that the designers of these phones anticipate and plan for these accidental pokes. And it looks like the OnePlus 10 Pro is prepared for this with the waterproofing membrane once again placed at the top of the shaft and not the end. And the gold microphone box is resting above that membrane. No damage could ever happen to the microphone or waterproofing with this phone either. The OnePlus 10 Pro is safe. Now for the iPhones. And this applies from the iPhone 10 all the way to the iPhone 15 since Apple doesn't change anything but the name and price. Microphone hole penetration isn't as big of a deal here since the SIM card tray is on the side and the microphone hole is down at the bottom. The microphone is mounted, once again, above the shaft so it won't be punctured if anything slips in. The hole itself though is blocked by metal mesh, and this mesh if it were to get punctured would not be water resistant anymore, but it would be very hard to accomplish that on accident. The iPhone is safe. Let's take a look at the Pixel 6 Pro's holes since we're on a roll. Like the iPhones, this Pixel does not have a SIM card tray and microphone next to each other. The SIM card tray is again on the side with a speaker and one microphone at the bottom, and a second microphone in the plastic section up at the top. Lifting up the screen we can unplug it just like a little Lego. And a few more screws release the top earpiece speaker. Now this layout is slightly different. Of course I can poke through the microphone hole on the top side of the phone, which can go into the microphone channel of the speaker. But again, off to the bottom side of the shaft this time, we have the waterproofing mesh, and that microphone itself is mounted below that shaft instead of above. But still impervious to accidental stabs. So far so good. Every phone we've checked is safe. Let's finish off with the Mi 11 to see if Xiaomi has also anticipated poke happy people. The SIM card tray is down here at the bottom, and the microphone is here as well, but farther away on the other side of the USB-C port which is a good placement from an anti-accidental skewering perspective. With the back off and the screws loose we can tell once again that the waterproofing is off to the side of the shaft, but it's interesting to see that this time the diameter of the shaft does extend all the way to the back end of the chamber, which means the SIM card tool can fully penetrate into the hole. But it's still in no way able to puncture that water resistant layer or get to the microphone that's off to the side. The Xiaomi Mi 11 is also safe. And there we have it. Five phones with slightly different, yet still effective solutions to keeping your phone damage free if that SIM card removal tool enters where it shouldn't. As we know, to err is human and it's nice that smartphone designers have foresight enough to anticipate this potentially catastrophic event and design phones that prevent punctures before they ever happen. So if you've ever stabbed a microphone hole with a SIM card tool, you may now rest assured that your phone is not compromised or broken and still has all of his water resistance intact. Thumbs up for that. If you think 10 fingers are too many, you can always help support the channel by getting one of my razor knives. I'll leave a link down in the description.

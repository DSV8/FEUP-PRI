    "transcript": "- Just make sure that you are different from the guy sitting left and right of you. - I like what you said there. Rather than trying to get everyone to become the same person, you're saying be unique. Yeah? - Yeah. So think about whether you are adding any value and whether you are gaining any experience in your job. - You don't think machine learning is gonna take or AI is gonna take jobs away in the next five to 10 years. - Well, you know every time we get new technology, it takes jobs away. Just ask weavers. Supposedly they were breaking up machines in the 18th century because they were taking jobs away or something. - Good point - So I've heard. CLI jockeys will disappear. VLAN Masters will disappear. But on the other hand that has been happening for the last 300 years. Do you have this feeling that we ran out of jobs? - I agree with you. It sounds like you just have to adapt. - Yeah, we got from half a billion to 10 billions or something and we still have jobs. - Yep, good point. - The repeatable jobs will go away. Intelligent jobs, not for a long time. So if you're not learning anything new, if you're not gaining any experience, if what you're doing can be described as a decision tree that job will be gone in a few years. No question about that. So find the job where you're learning. Where you're gaining your experience. And if you can't find that job in your current company, start polishing your resume. (upbeat music) - What do you think are the next big trends? A few years ago we had open flow. We weren't getting into that network automation. Before that we had Voice over IPs, stuff like that. I mean, you've seen many, many trends over the years. What do you think is a good trend or trends to look at if you're just starting in this industry? So are there any waves that I can ride if I've just started? - For a young person going into IT, I would say focus on the cloud. because everyone will have to do something with the clouds eventually. And traditional environments will have no idea whatsoever how to do that. - What about machine learning AI? What do you think about that? - Well, once the current wave of hype dies, it will be useful. Well, it's always been useful but if so in 1990s we had this huge hype how AI will save the world and nothing much happened. In the meantime, a lot of people were hidden from the public work on solving a lot of interesting problems. And so they got to a point where machine learning is useful and it is actually used in certain environments. Like, I dunno, image recognition, voice recognition really hard problems that were intractable 10 years ago. And because they solve this particular domains it's all overhyped now that yeah, now we can solve everything with machine learning while you can't even solve Amazon hiring problem with machine learning as they proved (David laughs softly) You can't even write a Twitter bot with machine learning as Microsoft proved. So it's all overhyped. And on the other hand, everything is artificial intelligence now. You look at the definition of artificial intelligence. It says literally that it's when a computer well, a system behaves like an intelligent being would behave. Something along those lines, which means that a decision tree is artificial intelligence. - It's a good point. - An if statement is an artificial intelligence. If you say, if it rains take the umbrella and yet now you code that in Python, that's artificial intelligence. - That's exactly right. - Yeah, I know. So it's all totally ridiculous and useless. It doesn't mean that there is no substance there, there is a lot of substance. And if you feel inclined to work on that. If that excites you go for it. Just remember that it's not nearly as rosy as what you read on Facebook. - So do you think it'll be something that happens in the next few years or is that like way off? - Well it's already happening. Siri is based on machine learning, right? - Yeah. - So in certain domains it's in production and it has great results. The problem with machine learning as such as I see it is that you need huge well labeled datasets. So you either need a small domain and then you go do adversarial learning. Like you get from zero to a grand master in chess in 30 minutes with enough CPU power because the domain is well-defined. Machine learning is great for that. If you say, well, figure out what's wrong with my network. Well, where where's my learning set? How do I know that what is currently in my network is okay? And I was once listening to a presentation of a lady working at one of those, you know all of these big vendors have their security departments and they're collecting samples from all over the world and there's machine learning on top of that and there's visual intelligence and we get threat intelligence out of that. And she was like, you know what guys? Most of the hard stuff is hard coded by humans. - Oh, that's funny. - Yeah, we are analyzing the unknown samples and we are figuring out what's going on and then we code stuff to recognize the new stuff. - So you think it networking that's long time if ever. - Well, you see, there are certain things where decision trees are very helpful like low level troubleshooting. Like the thing that never worked on windows like troubleshoot my internet connection. That never gave me useful results. But honestly, if you take a look at what a level one tech is... Technical support is doing, it's scripted decision tree. - Yes, a good point. So it's just a human following a tree. And then-- - Yeah, if a human can follow a tree and if the tree is well-defined maybe a computer can follow the tree. So if you let the computer follow the tree and log into all your boxes and do the various show commands and erase the printouts. And then maybe you can do some simple anomaly detection on top of that, that's all extremely useful. But present machine learning thingy with a never before seen networking problem and expect it to solve it, good luck. - So you don't think machine learning is gonna take or AI is gonna take jobs away in the next five to 10 years. - Well, you know every time we get new technology, it takes jobs away. Just ask weavers. Supposedly they were breaking up machines in the 18th century because they were taking jobs away or something. - Good point - So I've heard. CLI jockeys will disappear. VLAN Masters will disappear. People troubleshooting internet connections for grandmas will disappear. But on the other hand that has been happening for the last 300 years. Do you have this feeling that we ran out of jobs? - I agree with you. It sounds like you just have to adapt. - Yeah, I mean, we got from half a billion to 10 billions or something and we still have jobs. - Yep, good point. - The repeatable jobs will go away. Intelligent jobs, not for a long time. - So if I'm a person who does anything repetitive like you said, like crate VLAN, stuff like that. I really need to worry. Yeah? - Yeah. Like that telephony person that patched the cables. So think about whether you're adding any value and whether you are gaining any experience in your job. Because honestly, if you're configuring villains all day long, are you gaining any experience? No - You're learning to type. You're learning to type. Great. - Yeah. - That helps you if your next job is a secretary. Until Siri comes along. - Good point. - So if you're not learning anything new if you're not gaining any experience if what you're doing can be described as a decision tree that job will be gone in a few years. No question about that. So find the job where you're learning where you're gaining your experience. And if you can't find that job in your current company, start polishing your resume. Go to networking events, look around, find someone, persuade him that the value you could bring to the table is good enough for him to create the job opening for you. - I like that. You're saying you're not just chasing jobs. You trying to get a job that suits you. - Yeah, now you have to have job created for you. - Yeah, but that means you've got to have unique skills. - Well, not necessarily because very few people are in the top 001% of whatever. But if you have good skills in like four different things and it's a rare combination of four different things, then you're probably unique. - That's a good point. You're a decent networking engineer. You know how to make presentations. Your presentations look good and you have presentation skills. How many people you know that fit the description? - No, I agree with you. A hundred percent. So just to note that you just gave three skills there and that's hard to get. - It's like you don't need cookies because you can fingerprint the browsers. Just looking at... With JavaScript you can almost uniquely identify the visitor just by looking at the user agent or the plugins installed, screen resolution, all that, collect 10 pieces of information you have fingerprinted your client, which means that if you have five unique skills and they're not the same skills that everyone else is having you're probably pretty unique. - So I'm going to push you because I like to do this. So you mentioned like being able to present like talking in front of an audience, create PowerPoint presentations have an understanding of networking. Anything else? - No, no, I said create-- - Create a decent looking PowerPoint presentations. That's a different - Yeah, a hundred percent. Anything else you think we... Like you mentioned cloud as a big skill. Anything else you you'd wanna add to that? - Well, it could be anything. It could be people skills. Like you are really good at getting a job done. You're really good at motivating people to get the job done. You're really good at listening to people. You're really good at figuring out what the actual problem is. Not what the server people are telling you. Like we need fresh re-run. Do you really? (both laughs slightly) On the technical side, it could be programming. It could be website design. It could be building up static websites. It could be, I dunno. Linux skills, DNS skills, database skills, whatever. Just make sure that you are different from the guy sitting left and right of you. - I like what you said there. Rather than trying to get everyone to become the same person you're saying be unique. Yeah? - Yeah. Eventually, in your organization, they will need a website. Maybe you are the guy who can do that. Maybe the networking team needs reports and those reports, everything is collected. They just need the reports to be written. The data is there and no one knows how to turn those Excel spreadsheets into PDF. That's honestly a problem for some organizations. - Yeah, I think it's amazing what big companies struggle with sometimes. - Like how do you create PDFs? Did you know that there is this open source thing that can turn HTML into PDF? No, really? (laughs softly) - What's your opinion about learning open-source stuff? I think you're a big advocate for that kind of thing. Is that right? - I'm always a big advocate of knowing as many tools as possible. If you're a wood worker, do you only work with a saw or do you have a saw and the hammer and a chisel and a router and a CNC machine (laughs softly) You get the idea. The more tools you know, the easier it will be to select the right tool for the job. - You mean a hammer doesn't work? - Imagine, yeah. Imagine you're a woodworker and the only tool you know is a hammer. And you have this two by four and you have to split it in half. Eventually it works with a hammer I was told. (both laughs slightly) The results are suboptimal sometimes. And the beauty of... Well, there are two beauties of typical open source tools. At least to play with them. It's free. And if the documentation sucks, you can always look at the code. Which is sometimes so frustrating with closed source tools because they don't work the way they are documented to be working and you can't figure out why they don't work that way. And there is absolutely no way to figure out what's going on behind the scenes because you can't look at the source code. I'm not talking about looking at the source code of free range routing. That would be way beyond me. (David laughs softly) But simple tools written in Python. Like a few hundred lines of Python code, you should be able to look into that and figure out why it's broken. Like maybe an Ansible module comes to mind. (both laughs softly) - I know you love Ansible. - Oh yeah, I do. - So I don't-- - I have a very special relationship with Ansible. (both laughs softly) - Do you have time for another question? - Sure. (upbeat music)",

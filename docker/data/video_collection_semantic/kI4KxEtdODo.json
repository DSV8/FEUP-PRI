    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and today I am so excited for this video because I am going to try to attempt to get out of a straight jacket. You might be like, Justine, why are you doing that? And to that I'm like, You know what? Why not? - How do you feel? - I feel good. - You feel good about that? - Yeah. I have been such a huge fan of magic and just the whole culture around it since I was very, very young. I actually used to want to be a magician, but it really didn't end up working out very well for me. I kind of found video games and juggling instead of magic, but I've still always loved it. When I partnered with NordVPN to do a video, I thought, what could I do? What NordVPN is, is it will encrypt your network traffic, so you're untraceable on public WiFi. You can secure up to six devices at the same time on almost any device. Android, iPhone, macOS, Linux, pretty much anything that you're searching the web or you're connected to, you can secure it. Another cool thing is you can get around a country's specific content locks or blocks or laws. They have over 5,100 servers in 62 different countries. If you guys want more information, I will put a link in the description and you can check it out. But now I want to introduce you guys to Magic Murray. I am so excited for this video. He came all the way from Vegas to be in this video today. Let's go hang out with Magic Murray. - I'm so excited to be here! - This is amazing, you just drove in from Vegas to be here. - I did, thank God I didn't walk. - [Justine] That's good. - I left at four in the morning and I beat traffic until I got to L.A. because you never beat traffic in L.A. - You don't because there's traffic all the time, no matter when, where-- - Every time, right? - It's crazy. - Yeah. - In Vegas, you do a show there, tell them a little bit about yourself. - I got a show at the Tropicana Hotel, the Laugh Factory. We do it six days a week. I actually have these two weeks off because it's a slower time just before Christmas, and then it gets really busy. I kind of bounce around, do some videos, that's why I'm here. - I was talking to you guys about NordVPN, which I feel like a lot of people have this false sense of security when they're on the internet, because you think you're anonymous, you think everything is safe. I was kind of relating that in a sort of straight jacket type scenario. I wanted to try to get out of one and see if I can do it. - I brought my straight jacket with me just for you. - I told you earlier that I used to want to be a magician when I was younger. - I know, I didn't know that, it's amazing! - Yes, I love magic, I'm just so fascinated by all of it. - And you used to juggle, you told me. - I still do juggle. - I'm excited about that, I want to see you juggle later. I'd like to see you juggle later. - Okay, can you juggle? - Barely, but I can. - Okay, I'll teach you to juggle, you teach me to get out of a straight jacket. - Okay, let's do it. Little buckles. - Should I have went to the bathroom before I got in this? - Yeah, you should've. You should've, yeah. When you're in it, you probably can't do much. Put your arms through those two sleeves. - Is there any historic facts about straight jackets? - No, it just is really old and smelly. - Let me move my microphone. - Alright. - This is the magic, the behind the scenes magic, you guys. How long have you been straight jacketing? - For a few years now, for a few years. It's a bit of an addiction. What happens, we do this up in the back, alright. That goes in the buckle there, goes through this little thing here. That's locked in there. This is a it large for you because you're so tiny. - [Justine] Thank you, I'll take the flattery. (both laughing) You think I'll be able to get out? - [Murray] You might be able to, actually. - Is there a special technique so if you ever find yourself in a straight jacket, that people might wanna think about? - [Murray] Yes, the technique is really try hard. (laughs) That's it. - Are you left handed or right handed? - I'm right handed, actually. But when I play sports, if I play baseball, I hit the ball with a left handed version. - We're opposite because I write left handed, but I play all sports right handed. - I need you to swing your arms the other way. - Okay. Should we show them what's happening back there? (Justine yelping) - Are you alright? - Yeah! - [Murray] You good? Okay, I just want to make sure it's tight. - No, it's okay, I'm just being dramatic. - How do you feel? - I feel good. - Hang on. - I'm gonna get twisted like a pretzel. - Are you ready? - Yeah. - Okay, three, two, one, are you ready? - Yes. - Three, two, on, go! - I should've watched some YouTube videos before this! - There you go, right? - I messed up. - Push your leg through there. - Am I supposed to? - You can try it. - My dog has peed and pooed all over this place. - Nice! This could be a new yoga thing, actually. This could be actually a new yoga thing. This is good. - Okay, I just need to namaste. - [Murray] Do you feel Houdini-like? - [Justine] A little bit. - We're gonna go for lunch and then when we come back, do you want anything while we go out? (Justine laughing) - I think I'm stuck! Why am I stuck in my leg? Should I do something different? Wait. - That's it. - I've done something. - That's good, you've done something. - Okay but now my hand is twisted. This looks like something I should do. - [Murray] This is great! Nice, so now what you gotta do is get your other arm over your head. - [Justine] Other arm over my head. This one, or this one? - Point your right one, perfect. - Okay. - [Murray] Excellent, how do you feel about that? - It's like now I'm just twisted behind myself. - Try to unbuckle the one from the two that are attached behind you now. Get them in front of your face and use your teeth to pull off the buckle. - So my hands are here now. But it was a mistake, you should've told me that before! - Sorry, I forgot that part when you were doing the dance. (Justine laughing) - That's right, you want to get your teeth on that buckle. - Okay. - But your face is the wrong way. - My face is over here! - Perfect, there, now you did it, which is great. - [Justine] I've gotten myself into a pickle! (Murray laughing) - How'd you get your hands behind you? - I forgot. - That's what I wanna know! - I have a hand! - Yes, you do, unbuckle the back strap. - I'm definitely cheating because I... Yeah! For my final trick. - There you go! See, now you got it. You just pull it that way, to the right. - Oh! - [Murray] Then once it pops off. - Oh my gosh. - There you go. Yes, here it comes, make it very dramatic. You gotta swing it around, do not lose it. Swing, no, not you, the jacket. That's it, you nailed it, only two hours. You nailed it. - Wow, I can't believe it, I thought I was actually gonna be stuck in it. Do you want to show the proper way? - Sure, I can show you the proper way. I wonder how your neighbors feel. Imagine looking in, going, well, oh nice. A little gardening. - [Justine] They moved out. I don't want to hurt you. - I think this is way more tighter on me than it was on you. I'm just gonna throw it out there, I'm just gonna throw it out there. - For sure. Three, two, one! - Okay, here we go! (fabric rustling) - You're doing some things. I made it super tight, whoa! That's something I should've done. - There we go. - You just let me get on the ground and roll around like a fool, when I could've done this. (Murray laughing) (Justine squeals) - You're swinging around like a fool! I'm backing up! You look like a little fish. - See, you have to really sell it. - You sold it. I can't believe you let me roll around on the grass. - It was great, that was worth the whole price of driving to L.A. - But I did get out of it, so let's not forget. - You did get out of it, I know. - You also brought something else, too. - Yes. - What did you bring? Let's go get the other thing! - Do you have a lighter at all, or anything on you? I know you have a flamethrower, do you have a lighter-lighter? - Okay, ready? Watch carefully, ready? Nice, good. - It's windy. Hold on a sec, is this the trick? Can you make wind happen? - I know, right? Nailing it, this is great. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - Isn't that cool? So now we have a deck of cards. Let's do a trick. They came with the lighter. You wanna see a trick? - Yeah! I'm still processing. - It's a normal deck of cards, yes? - Yes! - Now we're gonna see they're different. - Yeah! - They're different. What's a good card in the deck? You're playing in Vegas, what are your cards? - Ace. - You like aces? - Yeah! - Alright, let's do this. We cut the deck once, twice, a few times, and say stop whenever you want. - Stop. - Right there? Great, take the card, hang on to it, look at it. Look at it. Show the camera, is that an ace? Perfect, okay, good, so that's one. - Yeah! - You can show me, it's okay. - Okay. - Perfect. - See? Surprise. (both laughing) - Okay, let's cut the deck. How many times do you want me to cut the deck? - Two? - Once, twice, three times? What do you want? - Yeah, two. - Two? - Yeah, I like it. - Alright, once, twice, like that. Take the card. Show the camera, excellent. And there's your second ace. (Justine gasping excitedly) - I'm shooked, no! - I've got an idea. Let's check this out. Top card here is jack of what? Spades? - Spades. Very good, take it off. Excellent, there's the third ace. - No, what is happening? My small mind is-- - What's the other ace we need? Show the camera. - We need a spade. - [Murray] Ace of spades, so ace of spades, that's the hardest one. - Really? - Yeah, it is, but it's the most active one. - Super active? - Go like this, yeah. - No, oh my gosh! Where did it come from? - You could've picked any card. - No! - You could've said twos, sevens, but you said aces. - Did you know I was gonna pick this? Is it planned, is it plotted? Oh my God! - I just mentally, after watching your demonstration in the straight jacket, I thought, this is what she's gonna pick. I felt it. - No way, this is so cool! - You wanna try something? Let's do this. - Yes! So we need red, black, red, black, alright? Top card, what color? - Red. - Red. Hold out your hand, don't move, keep that there, watch it. Bottom card, what color? - Red. - Are you sure? - It's red, yes. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - Keep that there, put your hands on top of the two red cards, go back and forth. Make sure you, not... See how it's too much? - Oh. No, no, 'cause they're here. - No! - No, that's what happens, so you rub them too hard, you rubbed them way too hard. You gotta be gentle, you gotta be nice with them. - What? How did they? - I know. So you wanna see something really cool I brought? - Yes! - I brought something, 'cause I know we were talking about Houdini and all the stuff that he does and all that, but I actually have a pair of Houdini's handcuffs from 1915. - No way. - You want to see them? - Yes, I do! - Look, they're right there! Here, I'm gonna bring them over. - They just appeared out of nowhere. - [Murray] Back in the day, they were worth about $2.50, back in 1915, and now they're worth about $8,500. The price of a Starbuck's caramel macchiato. - Oh my goodness. - So there they are. - You have a key. - Wow, that's really cool. - So these are called the Darby style handcuff, just for historical, I love history stuff. Your hands would go through here and the bar would separate your wrists. That was back in the day, nowadays they have a chain. So if you see, look at the key, it's cylindrical, so there's nothing really identifying because it's a hollow key. What would happen is it goes into here, and then there's a bar in here, and that goes over the bar, spins the bar down, locks it down, and then to get the key back out you have to back-turn the key, so it looks like you're undoing the handcuffs, but you're not, though. You're just taking the key off the bar, and that's how these work. You wanna lock me up, see if I can get out of these? - [Justine] Okay. - Now hold it together, make sure it's nice and tight. That's it, go for it, there you go. - [Justine] And then that's locked in. - Now pull on those, make sure they're locked. - [Justine] I'm making sure. Yeah, you're in there. - Yeah? - Yeah. - [Murray] Locked, yeah? - [Justine] Yeah. - Alright, just want to make sure. Okay, good, slap me in the face. Let's see the hairpin, you got a hairpin? - [Justine] Yes. - You can count how fast I can get out of this if you want. - [Justine] Okay, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. (intense dramatic music) - That's it. - I was just about to say this is a discount hairpin. - Just want you to know it's been in my mouth. (both laughing) Add that to the pile. - Wow, that's amazing! What made you want to do that? - Jail time. - Okay. - No. (laughing) - Well thank you so much for coming here and doing some tricks for me, we're also gonna do a video on his channel, so I'm super excited to show you guys that. I'll put all of his links in the description, you have to go check him out, subscribe, go say, hi, and if you guys love magic, here you go. - Thank you, bye! - Thank you! (light music)",

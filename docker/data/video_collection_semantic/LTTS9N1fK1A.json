    "description": "It looks like it's actually $299 now  Aiwa Exos-9 Speaker (USA) -  Aiwa Exos-9 Speaker (International) -   This is one of the best portable bluetooth speakers I've ever had on the Unbox Therapy desk.  Here is some more info from the manufacturer -  The Exos-9 is the only portable bluetooth speaker that boasts 5 active speaker drivers, including a 6.5 inch dual voice coil subwoofer, in its category.  Other speakers in the category have NO active subwoofer and are simply not as powerful. The Exos-9 features 200 watts of continuous power where the others top out around 40 watts.  How are we able to provide more powerful, better quality sound at a better value than the others? We believe in putting more resources into our products than into TV ads and celebrity endorsements. This allows us to build the very best products and offer them at the best value.  Linking two Exos-9s is easy and provides either stereo separated (L+R) or dual stereo (LR + LR) sound. Entertain a 75-guest party that will surely draw the attention of your neighbors and local authorities.  Crank the bass, mids, or highs. Or crank them all. We won't judge. With 4 available pre-sets you can trust our taste or fine tune the EQ to your liking. The customizable EQ makes the Exos-9 perfect for every genre of music as well as podcasts and audiobooks.  Sharing is caring, unless your friends have poor taste in music. Share control of your Exos-9 or apply the Bluetooth lock to keep it paired to your device exclusively.

    "transcript": "So one of my favorite things to look at, here on Unbox Therapy. Speakers. Bluetooth wireless speakers. right, they taken over the whole landscape of the way that we listen to music. But there's no shortage of different brands trying to make next best one, trying to make the greatest one. And what I have seen recently, emerging... these boombox style, large form factor Bluetooth speakers that are essentially replacing the boombox of yester-year Their a step better sound wise Than those ultra portable ones, but they are still kinda portable themselves Now this one, a lot of people say, it might be the top dog. So what were going to do here Is what we do best, Find out if they are telling the truth. It's the AIWA Exos-9 portable Bluetooth speaker. Big Speaker, Big Sound Two is better than one, So can link these together with one button If you want even more sound. It can go outside, you can unplug it, so it's got a battery in there 50 ft Bluetooth operating radius That's good A number of speakers on the front. NFC pairing I like that And the battery is good for about 10 hours. It can also charge up your phone or tablet, Via the USB charging that's on board I've got a whole playlist for bluetooth speakers, So you can go back, watch the videos, look at my expression right here I'm pointing at myself with a knife and all the evidence is right there. This here; this don't lie alright there's no script there there's never been a script on here Jack's waving paperwork over there I'm saying put it away man *points knife at Jack and then to camera* Good bye... to \"good enough\" HOO! Here's the unit, Woah! This looks like the battery, power and axillary ; if you maybe need it *Places speaker on the table* *Unwraps plastic on speaker* Oh wow! Padded handle on the back, You know you could be... Oohhh Looks like some controls: ' link', 'EQ', 'Play/Pause'. That metal, feels like metal. A volume knob, and then on the back, we have USB charge here, this says is for software updates, that's a Micro USB connector it looks like. USB charge for your device, maybe the device that you're streaming from or... maybe you want, maybe you want to just want to share some juice with whoever it is that's at your picnic. There's a line in if you want to go axillary, power and then a power switch. That's what a battery goes. See if it shows up in a bluetooth here, Maybe I just do NFC. OH! \"Are you sure you want to pair with the bluetooth device\" Yes please Oh wow! It's an actual full-out EQ control, 1,2,3..4..5, stage EQ control. You could scoop it out a little bit, have an enhancement on the lows and the highs. Options, I mean that's good... the other stuff I looked at, didn't have that so... there you go. *Music continuous to play from the speaker* WOAH! *Plays music from the speaker* We'r clipping or clipping and coordinating. This thing is loud! *Music continuous to play from the speaker* Play/Pause on the top *Music continuous to play from the speaker* Touch sensitive *Music continuous to play from the speaker* HO OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH!.. HO *Lew continues to be impressed* Ho Ho! X2 Woaaah.. That thing is pounding! *Music continuous to play from the speaker* WOAH! *Music continuous to play from the speaker* Very infrequently with the recording level that we have set on the microphone in the front, Very infrequently are we capable of even clipping,.. This might. Now... what you hear in those samples is the super high-end of the recording interface here before you.. started to get compression at the very end of the spectrum. this thing is loud,.. but the sound here, in front of me it's not breaking up at all. At the high end it's not crunchy yet, it's not like \"CRRR\"... It gets there easily. *Music continuous to play from the speaker* Like it's still thick, you know what I'm saying, it's still thick up there *Music continuous to play from the speaker* New bluetooth champion? *Music continues to play from the speaker* I think a lot of people want this to be their main stereo system. There are a lot of bluetooth speakers out there in the smaller category, those don't really replace your Stereo system Now i know alot of you are going to be sitting there saying: \"Lew, i don't have space for that, i need something portable\". And that's fine, that's fair. But when it comes to sound when it comes to acoustics there currently is no substitute for the physical scale. You have to have the cabinet size to resonate at that level. if you want that capacity, if you want to feel that thump, if you want to get people moving You got to have a cabinet to do it. This is loud enough that your neighbors could complain. $399 Great reviews on Amazon aswell, i'm not the only one apparently. There maybe a new value champion at $399 *Beat starts blasting through the speaker* *Lew is amazed* *Beat continues* WOOO! YEAH! *Lifts up and hovers speaker* *Makes up scenario* *Yelling over beat*Just show up like that!! \"Hey who let that man in?!\" \"Somebody call the police!\" \"I feel uncomfortable!\" \"The man has too much bass!\" \"I'm outta here!!\" *Lew walks away carrying the speaker\" Jack: Don't forget to Subscribe to Unbox Therapy and click the video to the left that is promoted on the screen ;)",

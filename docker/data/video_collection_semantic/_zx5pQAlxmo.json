    "transcript": "yeah this new SSD definitely looked like something out of a sci-fi film we're definitely getting into this really interesting territory of RGB experimentation and I personally don't mind it everything my water-cooled system is lit up so why not an SSD now previous RGB drives from TeamGroup had some issues with actual thermal throttling where the RGB was too hot and was heating up demand so let's see if this is the case with the new Delta Max RGB SSD after this the be quiet pure base 500 is a perfectly sized handsome mid tower with the usual silent properties on the front panel and foam on the interior with to quality fans included plus a modular top section to expand the cooling potential give you Hardware a new home with a pure bass 500 alright so first let's go over the basics the SSD comes in one terabyte 500 gigabytes and 250 gigabyte capacities $149 for the one terabyte drive is kind of expensive but the whole RGB element is quite unique and you are praying premium for it the top plate is like the blue and reflective looks great even without lighting it is thicker though then your non RGB standard SSDs it comes with two micro USB cables one for 5 volt a RGB motherboard sync and one for USB 2 that goes into your motherboard and gives us that spinning rainbow effect without any software control plugged in the team group logo is dead center with Delta max text in the bottom right as you can see the RGB illumination is very unique spanning the full top plate there is a bit of visual grain on the surface too with LEDs slightly visible on the edges of the body and this is the way so they are far away as possible from demand and the controller and all the heat is being generated on the actual corners and not in the center I think this looks much better versus the previous Delta R GB SSD that had just way too much going on with that top plate so I'm happy to see they've improved and cleaned up the design with the Delta max now this Drive is not an LCD screen but I feel like we might see that in the future and I recently reviewed the iBUYPOWER at the element enclosure with a transparent LCD on a side panel and I feel like it's just a matter of time until that type of technology and implementation of some sort of customization gets onto the SSD market because you know companies have to compete who has the fanciest and pointless bling but I will say it's not the prettiest thing with that massive TG logo in the center I think it would have looked better without it plus my model has this large white particle under the shiny top not very appealing once you notice it it is invisible when the driver is off but unfortunately you're not buying this drive to turn off the illumination now all the color effects will be determined by your motherboard software and since the LEDs are located on top and bottom but not on the sides pretty much any effect you apply kind of looks the same with just a change of direction and speed which is why I prefer the spinning rainbow effect or full solid colors that look vibrant and uniform as for performance it's pretty standard for sata based SSD consistent while copying my 100 gigabyte folder and speeds are not affected when RGB is enabled so there is no throttling of the drive with all that illumination enabled unlike on their previous gen SSDs also looks like you're not getting any faster read and write performance versus the previous gen Drive just a prettier package and an up-to-date RGB connector but check this out guys no hardware app can actually read the temperature of the drive which is suspicious but our thermal camera reveals the truth you can see the hot top and bottom edges get to over 50 degrees Celsius which is a little toasty with the area over the controller hovering around 34 degrees Celsius now this is the shot with RGB disabled and that controller area had cooled to 28 degrees Celsius with no more hot edges so in our testing the drive does not throttle with RGB as heat is generated on the edges but it does get hot and the second piece of this whole RGB puzzle is the new extreme memory I have the 16 gigabyte 4000 mega Hertz kit with the same blue mirror finish looks pretty awesome and the intent here is similar to that of the SSD by illuminating as much of the body as possible and the end result is a very unique looking RAM area so instead of just illuminating top section like we see on most RGB Ram the sides line up as well which would be pointless if you have the sticks right next to each other but you can actually see the diffusion piece from top and the bottom unfortunately the uniformity is no very consistent and individual LEDs are visible in that mid section where you have cycling of colors for example but otherwise the static effect is absolutely gorgeous and also since the motherboard automatically picks up the RAM for color sync no cables are needed for the light show but everything in my system is much brighter than this new extreme memory now because of the mirror finish you can see other light sources bouncing off that create a very cool effect and surprise surprise no temperature sensor detected just as with the SSD and I really gotta give it to team groups for trying something new in the space of SSDs and RAM the memory is a bit dull and not as bright as others but still stands out because of the whole mirror finish while the SSD guts are pretty basic but that whole visual top is absolutely gorgeous but I'm thinking if you're buying multiple of those drives you'll have a hard time daisy chaining those argb connectors unless you have multiple 5-volt aRGB headers on the motherboard but still something to keep in mind alright that's it RGB is still insane and it's only the beginning of 2020 let me know if you guys agree and if you prefer and like what I showed you guys here today I'm three tree thanks much for watching all the links will be listed in the description below I'll talk to you in the next video",

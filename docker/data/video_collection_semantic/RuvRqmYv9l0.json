Basically these keyboard switches can have their actuation point modified though either software or the keyboard itself.  While this may not sound particularly interesting, the approach makes the Steelseries Apex Pro infinitely adjustable .  Its REALLY cool tech.

    "transcript": "hello good people armed we tree and back at the hotel and behind me we've got something real special today from SteelSeries they were launching the new apex line of keyboards the apex pro and the apex 7 but I want to talk today about the new omnipoint switches because they're mechanical they have interesting characteristics and normally I would not dedicated a single video just to talk about the switches because there's so many out there but this one is different and huge thanks to fan text and steelseries for sponsoring our Computex trip so what are omnipoint canticle and the main idea behind them is for the user to adjust the actuation distance so normally with MX cherry switches you have an actuation point at around 2 millimeters somewhere in the middle of the whole travel distance and that is when the switch is actually registered there's a physical contact within the switch itself that sends a signal and tells your source then when the key is actually pressed with Omnipoint which is the actual mechanism is slightly different but the actuation distance customization is very cool because instead of you wanting to actuate the key midway you can actuate it at really high point which means you don't have to press as much you don't have to bottom out and that whole range goes from point 4 millimeters which is insane that is currently I would say the fastest actuation switch you can you can get and it goes all the way to three point six so basically giving you the full range of motion between when the switches from the top to the bottom before it actually is registered and that is really cool now what are the usage case scenarios of something like the adjustability of your actuation point now with using the shortest actuation point at point four millimeters everyone's joking around that you might as well just blow on the switches and they will be activated and registered or going all the way to three point six millimeter travel distance for the actuation point to give you a type writer feel so going old-school if you like to really bottom out and the cool thing about the apex Pro is the ability to customize her key actuation point customization so your wall zone can be a certain actuation point while the rest do keys can be something else and that whole range of actuation distance is incredibly precise from point four to three point six millimeters and they're able to do that with magnets so there's one magnet in the actual stem that goes down and there's a magnet on the PCB and they're measuring the magnetic flux is what they tell us and somehow that goes into the firmware or the keyboard and that registered the amount of actuation point and where it should actually register the switch we're told a lot of calibration went into designing something like this and initially they went from 0.5 to 3.5 range but they figured out how to calibrate the magnets and calculating the magnetic flux that those magazines generate to give us even a lower actuation point and a slightly higher one to some more technical information so they are a 45 grams switch which is incredibly light and they were actually co-developed with gaiter one and they try to replicate the gaiter on red switches which I absolutely love they're my favorite switch now and still Sirius was like this is even better and I would say they're they feel slightly different the gator on reds have a slightly heavier that initial movement down while the Omnipoint switches are incredibly linear and that makes them really good for what they're trying to achieve within that actuation range some people have asked why they didn't go the route of having a tactile point built into the switch but that would make no sense for a switch on to which you can customize the actuation distance and because there are no metal contacts to register the actuation like you would see on an MX cherry the switch is basically bare-bones which means the durability is insane so they've tested a hundred million clicks plus and that takes months to constantly press with the Machine and they said that this is minimum 100 million clicks and it was it would just kept going still so durability in the long term for the Omnipoint which is and the last thing I want to cover is the usability of the Omnipoint switches for regular users I feel like it's almost similar to setting lighting on your system you set it once and you forget it unless you want to revisit that and chain up a little bit for some more customization I feel like the Omnipoint actuation distance will be exactly the same way if you prefer a light switch if you've been using let's say the MX cherry speed switches that actuate at one point two millimeters and they're really fast as well if you've been using something like that setting one point to here would be perfectly fine but if you want something that actually it's a bit further down below three millimeters that is a totally different experience too because if you like to bottom out while typing that is available and it kind of gives you that broad range between gaming between typing or something in the middle and now ladies and gentlemen I present you the type test and the last thing the actuation distance can be set through the keyboard or through the software and I would personally set the wast area to be around 3.5 because I like to bottom out when I'm walking my character while having the rest around 1.5 to 2 millimeters and the the point four millimeter actuation distance is actually quite insane but I feel like just resting my finger on the keys because they're so linear and so light I tend to just activate it accidentally and setting it's like the deeper actuation point would of course remove that accidental press alright guys so that is steelseries so many points which is explained let me know if you think they're gimmicky or actually functional for your usage case scenario in my previous experience with the wooden one keyboard that had analog switches on - you can also adjust the actuation point from I think 1.5 to three point six that was pretty cool but I said at once and I forget it but here you can go the actuation point really close to the surface for them to be incredibly light so you can tap on the keyboard and if you train it won't be an issue so guys I'm three tree thanks for watching make sure to check out this other relevant content I'll talk to you in the next video you",

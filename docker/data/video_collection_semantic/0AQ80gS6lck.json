    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine. And this is Ro. We just shot a video on her channel, a nice little celebration for the Valentine's day season. - Oh yeah! - I thought it'd be really fun to react to some of our old videos. - Ooh! - So we have- - I've never done this, have I? - I don't know. - Have we ever reacted to our videos before? - Did we do this video already? - No! - We might of. - No, this is new. - There's a really good chance. - I've never done this with you. - Well, this is exciting because today is the day, and we have 69 videos, this playlist. - Are you making that number up 34, 35 videos? - This is an ongoing playlist that I've been keeping for the past couple of years. Listen, here's the question. Do you remember what our first video was that we did? - I was just gonna ask you, how do you think we've made our relationship last over the years? You know, just a real love talk for Valentine's day. And then you hit me with the question of what's our first video and I don't have a clue. - Well, let me tell you, Ro what has kept us together? Starbucks. - True. - I called you this morning. - Yes. - I've only been to Starbucks three times since this pandemic started. - Really? - This was my third time. - Wow! - I got a little breakfast sandwich, and it was so good. I've missed it so much. - Aren't they good? They're delicious. - Yeah. - Oh definitely. You know, Starbucks kept us together, our love for dogs, and then I think I just honestly dig you. - Dig you as well. Look at this we're sharing the love here on Valentine's day which is actually- well we're posting this before Valentine's Day. - It's coming up. - The season. Our first video. - Okay, wait, were we baking? No, no, yes. - Ro, we were trying Starbucks. It was the first Starbucks challenge at your house. - Do you- - Shut up. - Yes. - That was our first video together? - Yes! Look, I'm wearing a little Star Wars shirt, you had your pink little sweater. - Oh my gosh, you're so cute. - You're so cute - Look at you in your little Star Wars shirt. - Oh my gosh we've hugged. - That was our first hug, I can't believe it. - That was our first hug! - [Rosanna] Oh my gosh. - [Justine] Oh my gosh. - [Rosanna] Filming on a round table, that table was so low. It was like awkwardly low. I'm a genius, I've figured out that frappuccinos are cold. (laughter) - [Rosanna] What year was this? - [Justine] 2016 Oh, he was probably not even a year old yet. - [Rosanna] 2016. Now he's so like chill. Now our second video, you actually came to my house and we baked together. We did the decorating challenge- - Okay, good, I was like we have to bake. - For you guys that don't know, Ro does like so much really great prep for her videos and knows everything that she's gonna be doing. - Lots of prep. - I was like, I don't know we're gonna do something, just come on over, we're gonna do something. - Is this the one with the big- - [Justine] The big spatula. - [Rosanna] The huge spatula, I've never- - [Justine] Yes! - You have the coolest kitchen. All those lights. - You have the coolest kitchen. - [Rosanna] Gosh. - [Justine] So yeah, this is like, I think, was this right around, when did your book come out? - Oh my gosh, yeah. - The first one? - Like six years ago? - So this was 2016. - That was the first book? What is my necklace? Like, you know, when you think you're looking really cute and then you look back and you're like, what is on my body? - It's cute, I think it's cute. - [Justine] Look at our cakes. - [Rosanna] Ohhhh, man, wow. - I was like so worried, I was like Ro is coming over and we're going to make a cake and this is what I have for her. Look at this. - Oh my gosh yes, yes. - Oh wait, this, this was a vlog. - Yeah yeah we did two of them. - I vlogged about it. - We did part one and then we had so much fun we did a second one. I think they were like seasonal drinks. - Okay, I'm vlogging in 2016 in 60 frames a second and I'm disgusted with myself. - Why? What's 60 frames a second? - It's a tragedy is what it is Ro. - What do you mean? Oh, there's Cookie. - Who was I? - Is 60 frames a second fast, or slow? - It's fast, like you don't- - Right. - It's, this is- - This looks great. - Remember when we un-boxed Snapchat spectacles? - This was my first un-boxing ever. - It was. - I had never done an un-boxing before and you were showing me these spectacles and this is the very first, this is the very first one. - After this, we went somewhere. I think we went to Lindsey's show or something? - We went to an event. - [Mike] I think officially the first video you guys did together was the music video. - Shut up. - Mike just informed us that the 'perfect together' music video was (gasp) - This was so beautifully shot like it's incredible. - [Rosanna] Thank you, I loved doing this. I should actually do this more. I had so much fun you guys, making this music video we built this entire set on the YouTube soundstage, their largest soundstage. It's a custom choreographed waltz. It's like a unique waltz. - [Justine] It's so cute. - [Rosanna] You were so cute, look at you. - [Justine] Ah! There I am! - There's Jimmy, Captain Sparkles, there's Jordan. - Oh my gosh, this is so- - Justine how come it feels like I've known you for 10 years? - Okay but the first video, when I, I actually found out about you was from- - Which one? - the Call of Duty cake that you made. - (gasp) Yes! What year was that? - We're gonna find out. (gasp) 8 - That was when I wanted to ask Justine - 8 - to come bake with me - 8 but I was too nervous 'cause she was like, just doing everything on the internet and I was just starting so I was too nervous to ask her to come bake with me so I made a cake that I thought she would love and then I kind of just like - I freaked out. Everybody was tweeting it to me - I was like, ooh look what I do. - I go, oh my gosh, who's this cool girl that's making cool cakes. - [Rosanna] Look at me. (laughing) - [Justine] This is the best. Look! Everybody wanted you to make Black Ops 2 cake. Wow. - I literally had this army helmet. I went to this army surplus store and they had like all these cool things. And I was like, oh cool, put all his stuff in here. And then I look stupid. - The fact that this is like eight years ago and like what you have created. - Do you see this red mixing bowl? - Yeah. - For years, I got this old at Walmart and there was a crack in it for years, but I did not have the money, I did not have the budget to buy a new bowl so I literally would scotch tape it every time I used it. Maybe you can spot it. - [Justine] But this is so cool 'cause it's like, I mean this is something that you're so passionate about - Look at it, it's right there. - Like you, like that's amazing. - [Justine] You just knew this was what you were gonna do because like a lot of people, they think that like YouTube happens like overnight and they think that it's easy, and they think that everybody is just given everything. Like it's not, it's a lot of hard work. - Yeah. - So like you should be so proud of everything that you've done and you guys should be so proud because this is, this is crazy. Look, you started from crap bowl- - This is- - and now you're here. - This is so embarrassing, it's like a $4 bowl from Walmart and I was like, well, there's my budget for the year. - Look at the cake. It's so cool. - And girl, that was made on a budget so that is a budget cake and I think it looks pretty good for what we had. - I'm impressed. Remember we tried fun Valentine's day candy today? Well, here was our last one, 2017 - [Rosanna] (gasp) What, we had big gummies then too. - We did, oh my God and they're video game ones. - Those are cool. I really liked Henley's. - [Justine] Oh my God, this was a tattoo lollipop and card. Do you remember that? - (both) You put it on your tongue! - [Rosanna] Look at it, look at it, look at it! And we're like, this is great. - [Justine] I put two. - [Rosanna] Oh my God, you're double facing it! (laughter) - It's not that good of an idea. Wait so this was at your old place. - We did the Lego, I thought you'd be proud of me, we made the little holder out of Legos. - This is where I learned about these chocolate melting pots, I was like- - The fondue pots. - What is this? It changed everything in my baking. - [Rosanna] Well this is when I was doing a lot of little brands. - [Justine] This is so cute, we're making our little Lego marshmallows. Look at us with our nails did. - Your nails look awesome when they're black by the way. - [Justine] I miss it. - [Rosanna] I love that color, that polish, that's really pretty. - Remember when we went to Hawaii. - (gasp) That was so fun. - Oh man check out my drone shot just for a- - Okay your drone is freaking amazing. - [Justine] This might've been the part where it actually took off. - [Rosanna] It took off. - [Justine] Yeah. I had to find the drone on a map. (gasp) So wait we did this crazy hike across this river. Let's see what our most popular is. - [Rosanna] What do you think it is? - [Justine] Oh my gosh, it's the cake decorating ones. - [Rosanna] Is it really? - [Justine] Yes. 12 million. - Really? - That's a lot, why are you guys watching that? - You know what this tells me? We just need to do a talk show. - Yeah look at us. - Okay. I'll have to come up with a name or something. We can throw some names. If Justine and I were gonna have a talk show, would you guys please tell me in the comments down below what should be the name of it? Cause I don't know what to do. - We'll figure it out. - Oh, we're trying that little food kit. - Oh wait, yes. - The little toy food yummies. - Oh, we were trying to find dog products. - Aww! - This is such a sweet video, clearly neither one of them wanted to be here. - [Rosanna] No, they were like, I want treats and to go sleep or play. - [Justine] Aw Maddy, - [Rosanna] Look at Maddy - [Justine] he had such bad tear stains because his allergies were so bad. She's such a little loaf. - Aww I miss that little nugget but I have to say Blueberry Muffin is like coming into her own. I would say she's my next little angel baby. Look at us matching, look at our green tops. - I know, it's almost like we planned it. We didn't. - We didn't. - We didn't plan this either today. - No, We just show up and we end up dressing like each other. - You think it's like when like couples accidentally start dressing like each other - Maybe. - and then friends, over the years, we just do the same thing. - Kitchen, gadgets. You have done so many of those on your channel. - (gasp) So many. - We haven't done one in a while. - We need to do another one. - Because we, you know, because everything kind of shut down and I on my way here today got a COVID test. I was like, Ro, I'll be turning back around going home if it's neg- or if it's positive. - Yep. - We're here. - Yeah. - We good. This- - [Justine] We've done so much stuff. - [Rosanna] Because you love grilled cheese sandwiches. - [Justine] Yes. - [Rosanna] So I thought let's try this grilled cheese maker, I can't even remember if it was good. - Oh, it's hard to say. - [Rosanna] There's a company that clones them and they make the little clone of them and send them to you. - [Justine] So this sits in my house, and like it scares me all the time (laughter) because I think it's Maddy. And then I know my sister has the dog, and I'm like Maddy what are you doing here? You're not Maddy. - [Rosanna] Literally looks like them. - [Justine] It really does. So I know this is Mike's favorite video. The time we carved our faces into potatoes. - Can I say that after we did this a few other of my friends did this. - Really? - So you started a trend - Because this was not a trend This is absolutely the dumbest thing. - I was like what are we doing today? Justine brings over these potatoes and she was like we're going to decorate them to look like each other. (laughter) - We're at 1.8 million views right now. - Oh my gosh, decorating potatoes. - Look at this. (laughter) - [Justine] How did it, why do they look kind of good though, I'm surprised. - [Rosanna] They look great for potato art, you know? - [Justine] So we each made a potato of each- - [Rosanna] Look at these. (laughter) - This is so stupid. - [Rosanna] Mine is so ugly. Do you see the glued on shoes? - [Justine] What else have I made you do? I made you react to the new iPhone. Oh my gosh, this was the iPhone 11. - You always teach me new things that I had no idea existed. - Oh, this was my favorite. When we decorated the Christmas tree, every year around the holidays, I watched this video. It's so funny. It's so silly. - We are decorating a Christmas tree blindfolded. Somehow Justine has looped me into the lights. - [Justine] Yup. - [Rosanna] And I didn't realize that I was attached to the lights. (laughter) I'm lassoed in there. - [Justine] I love it so much. - [Rosanna] I think this is one of the best ideas you've ever come up with for the holidays. Cause I remember it too as being one of my favorite memories. - I seriously watch this like every year around the holidays, I'm like, Oh that's so good. - [Rosanna] I love to watch our holiday stuff at the holidays cause I've never done. What's it called? Vlogmas? - Mhmm. - I've never done it so I like watching our videos - It's really fun. - because they're all theme-y. - Wait remember this? - W-w-what? - We built this hot wheel set. - [Rosanna] Oh we had like hundreds of them going, they were going so crazy. - They actually move a lot faster than I act like, than I thought they would. - Do you remember? - Oh, man. - I was so I was like trying to find like kids sizes sweaters for you. - 'cause I need them. - [Justine] What the heck have we done? - [Rosanna] Wow. - [Justine] That was the- - [Rosanna] Wow! - [Justine] Oh my, I hate that, I think I actually threw those in the trash after I left. This is one of your kitchen gadgets. I think this is the one- Do you remember we tried to make Mac and cheese? So this was supposed to be like a whole video. - Mhmm. - And you ended up having to make an entire video off of the Mac and cheese because we had so many problems. - [Rosanna] Yep, we had so many- - [Justine] You got burned? - [Rosanna] Only went, yes. (laughter) There's a ton more videos if you guys want to check it out, I'll put a link in the description to a playlist that has both of the collab videos from both of our channels on it. There are so many! Well like, start taking notes like find your favorites, tweet 'em to us and let us know which ones you guys liked the most, and maybe we'll do some more. - Yes, please. - It'll be so fun.

    "transcript": "- Hello and welcome to This is. Austin. - Yes. Oh boy. Wait, let me try. Is this the latest mechanical keyboard? - This is the latest and greatest in gaming. (computer keys rattling) - Oh my God. It's membrane. This is disgusting. - This is a membrane gaming keyboard, but you know what? - Did you clean it? This looks still like... - I did not clean this. Do you know where I found this one of a kind. Of course he sniffs it. Of course he sniffs it. - Whoo! Okay. - So we went to a bunch of thrift stores around LA, 'cause the area we are, we looked at this and there were some trash. Then we went to some more wealthy neighborhoods. - Oh look at you. - And we might have found some of the greatest finds ever, not to be hyperbole here, but it's not that. - So can I ask how much the CD-R King game keyboard which definitely a game keyboard, because it has an email button on it. - This was $5. - That's about $3 too expense I think. (chuckling) - I agree. I agree. That right there was a piece of garbage. You know what wasn't a piece of garbage? - Look at the flex. - You wanna talk about flex? - Ooh. - Okay. - Ooh, Matt - Here. So we found this, the horrible keyboard at Savers. We found this one at, do you know that Goodwill has their own dedicated computer department? It's called Computer Works. It's a second hand computer store. We were browsing through it and we found this gem. - [Host] This is a nice little compact board. I mean, I personally like this style of board. I hate having a whole number row. - What do you think we paid for this? - So this is actually a, I mean it's not like a super high end board, but it's nice enough. It does have a full custom set of key caps including this very cool wavy space space bar. I mean it's a little dirty but honestly this seems totally fine. I would say $30. - The keyboard itself is $25. - Great deal. The Caps were way more expensive than that for sure. - [Matt] The caps were $90. - Yep. I completely believe it. These are nice custom caps. First of all, you can hear, it sounds pleasant. (computer keys rattling) I feel like with the board like this all it needs is a little TLC. This is actually something that you could legitimately buy, spend a couple hours just removing the caps cleaning it up since the deck is a little bit dirty, but honestly this is a completely solid pickup. - Yeah. Yeah. Now not everything. - (cross-talking) On top of the CD-R King 'cause the CD-R King - CD-R King is whatever. It's $5, whatever. - I need the spicy stuff - Define spicy 'cause. - I don't like that. - You wanna talk about spice? - I don't like that, no. See, I don't. - So at the Goodwill, we found about 9,000 of these Fitness Culture massage slippers. These guys here. - You (indistinct) see my feet on camera again, don't you? - Yeah. - Oh what, ah, what ah. Here's my colon button. I'm pressing my colon button. - So if you... (chuckling) - My genital button, what the... (chuckling) Yo I mean, this is clearly acupuncture inspired. So as you walk, you can hit your individual pressure points. - I wanna point out the little diagram here where it's... - Duo-duo-di-dum. What's duo-denim? - I don't know what. What's a uretus? Not, not, not uterus, a uretus? - I will say some of these twists when you step on them or when you push down on them, they also have different levels of pressure sensitivity. I'm gonna put them on now. I think that seems... I'm gonna walk around the studio. I will shout loudly what my thoughts are. - I Like how, we did not think this through because we have no way to record this. - Woo. - I will tell you, you probably can't hear in the audio here, they are loud as, I could just hear them click-clucketing, it's yeah. - You know what? I feel like I'm standing on a mechanical keyboard right now. Yo, those are actually not terrible. - Are they comfortable? - It's not uncomfortable because all of the individual little key-cappy things, they're very squishy and they turn down. So it actually feels like if you're walking on like pebbles or something, like I buy like some water. It's actually kind of a nice feeling 'cause it's a little bit of motion on your feet. - Let me ask you, what do you think we paid for this miracle of modern technology? - So judging by the fact that these were brand new in box, I'm gonna guess that some company bought 10,000 of them sold none of them, $15. - How dare you? How, you give us no credit that you think we would pay $15. We haggled them down. - You did not. - Got for $2. - $1 per slipper? What was the list price? - That was listed for $4? (laughing) - Let's go. Yo, I might keep these. - Okay. How you feeling about what we got so far? - I think the keyboard was great. I think the $2 slippers are very comfortable and stylish and it's a conversation starter and everything else is pretty decent. - Let me show you the gems - An iPhone. - I'm curious what your thoughts on this will be. - Okay, okay, okay. So without touching it, iPhone 6, maybe 6S, hard to tell from the front it's got weird discoloration on the top. I'm almost sure that that's from the case, someone left the case on this for five years and it, the color... - [Matt] Yeah, it almost looks like it was like left out in the sun with the case on - But I mean, honestly not in terrible condition. Little groddy, some... - DNA. - But honestly in... Stop saying that, Matt. I don't like that. - I just took a DNA test. It turns out I'm 100% a bad. - Okay. So can we cut parts outta the video preemptively? Is that a thing? - Stop cutting the video while we're shooting it. (editor sighing) - So I'm gonna fire it up. Doesn't work - Really? - Oh, so here's something majorly wrong. The front facing camera is not aligned with the hole. So this has definitely been opened. It is firing up right now. - I'll say, 'cause it was like fully charged yesterday. - So, camera. Oh, okay. All right, so camera looks good here. Snap it, but when we go to the front facing camera. Oh, what the, wow. The camera actually, the front-facing camera actually works. That's wild 'cause I can physically see the lens is almost entirely covered, but it works fine. Condition wise, short of a little bit of cosmetic stuff, which is really not too bad. This seems totally fine. I know that this phone should be no more than $50. - And that's exactly what we paid. For $50, to say this is gonna be your phone, I don't think you should do it. And I don't think you should put anything, you should not put your banking information on a phone that's not being updated anymore. Some of the newer generation phones would, I just don't think it was worth it, but having a cheaper phone like that for $50, I think that's not terrible. The problem is with this for $50 we were able to find 6Ss for about $10 more. - Oh 6S is significantly better. - When the 6S is out there and you can have the most recent OS for $15 more, you should totally do that. All right, let's let's talk about the real gem. Can you please reach under the desk? - No - Please reach under the desk. Please. - I've fallen for that one before. Oh my God. The ThinkPad, the ThinkPad. All right, All right lets go. - You know how we often title our videos, I Got Scammed by a Witch, I Got Scammed by all These Places. I scammed Goodwill. Me personally, Matt Ansini has taken down Goodwill, that not for profit organization. - Okay, so hang on. So don't tell me anything. Let me sus this up. - There is a specs list in there. - Okay, so I see USB three, we have SD card, VGA, Thunderbolt 2. That's definitely more modern. Core i7-4800 mq. So that is the workstation mobile version of 4th Gen which was Haswell. So a little bit older, but honestly still quad core, totally fine. This is definitely like a tried and true design. Obviously it's changed a bit but you got a little nipple, you got the track touchpad. - So there we got a bunch of other ThinPads that were garbage and this was in the middle of them. - Oh yo. Is that the fingerprint sensor? - Yes. - Woo. - It's got the little nubbin for the mouse. It's got a DVD drive. The real piece of (indistinct). (French music) Is that this was severely mislabeled. - Okay. What did they label it as - First of all, this has 8GB of RAM. - Oh, okay, much better. - They were completely unaware that this had a Quadro in it. - Woo, spicy Matt. I wanna learn a little more. 4th Gen would probably be 2012, 2013? So it's a little bit of an older system, but still totally reasonable. 8GB of RAM is solid that you could still run Photoshop, you could do a bit of video editing. This is a very reasonable system. So look at here. Oh we blue screen - We blue? - No, that's that's a great story. I opened up Task Manager. - Oh, oh - You tried to scam them, but they scammed you back. I would say though, that I want to just throw a new SSD in here and flash it. That's probably a fixable issue. It's a big changus. with Thunderbolt and everything. So, okay. Can I take a guess? - Yes. - So I think the real value, not what you paid, the real value of a system like this, probably about $300. I think that's about what you would be able to buy it on eBay for. - So I will tell you that the closest one we could find, which we could not find the exact match to these specs, was about $280. - Yeah. So about $300. I feel good about, I'm gonna say you bought this for $140. - Not quite that good. $170. - This is a great pickup for $170, honestly, especially given the GPU shortage and the chip shortage of today, I mean, this was probably a $3,000 laptop less than 10 years ago, right? Like eight, nine years ago? - This was an absolute beast in its day. And as soon as I saw this one I'm like, \"Okay, we have to get this.\" - I'm gonna take this home right now. - One of the only other things we found at the Goodwill which was just fun. - I'll take care of you, little buddy. - It's a Logitech Wii keyboard. It's a decent, it's membrane obviously. But it's a decent feeling keyboard. I didn't even know this existed. That's was my thing, is I saw it, I had no idea. - There've actually been keyboards for almost every Nintendo console ever. Including for like the DS and they've had typing games and all kinds of stuff. There must have been some major use for this, \"You suck noob, get Owened.\" $5? - 5$ - How much did you pay for the $5 keyboard? - $5. So... - Did he only negotiate for the (indistinct). - The one place, the one... Yeah, (chuckling) sandals, that's it. - He picked the $4 item and paid $2 for it. And you picked the cheapest item to get $2 off of it. They probably gave you $2 to make you go away 'cause they didn't wanna deal with you anymore. - All right, next. - Ooh. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Look, who needs all your keys when you can have the court layout. (chuckling) - So we, we bought these as a set. - This, I mean these are definitely not mechanical. They're like the mechanical feel style. So they're not that great. I mean, I can get a scenario in which you might want something like this because you wanna have your hands closer together and you're only gonna use realistically the keys that are over here, you don't need the whole board. I'd say this is next to worthless. This is probably worth the solid $15 to me. - We also thought that but doing the research, the cheapest we found one of these TS-36s was $48.50 when you factor in shipping. So it was like $37 and like $10 (indistinct). - [Host] Do people actually buying them. - I personally think the logic, maybe a little overpriced for where we got it. So it's $25, which you could find it, we found for like exactly $25 everywhere else but the fact that we were able to buy both of them for less than the cost of what the cedes was and it wasn't a terrible deal. - It's not bad, it's no Lenovo. - And here we go. I've saved the best for last - The best for last - Because that's how retention works on YouTube. - A fat PS3. Okay, okay, okay. Don't tell me anything. Let me divine this. - I will say this is one of those ones that we were not allowed to like play with before we bought. - What hard drive is it? Is it (cross-talking). This is probably one of the last, if not the last of the fat PS3 before they move to slims. So really not much point in buying this one 'cause this is the worst of the fat ones. It's got 80GB, which is nice. - So you save that but you had done a video though on PS3, Xbox 360 and how prices have skyrocketed. - [Host] Yeah. A lot of these are expensive, but I'll say I know the fat PS3 have not aged well 'cause they're really unreliable and most people want a slim. So these are actually not insanely valuable. - This is where I got disappointed, but I thought that all the fats had at least software emulation and that's where I was very disappointed when I went and found out that. So I'm gonna take the L on this one. Had them throw in a game, which was $8. - Oh Gran Turismo. So am I supposed to guess how much you spent on this? - [Matt] Yes. - I'm gonna use my powers of deduction and the powers of having an included free game. I'm gonna guess that you spent $89.99. - That is exactly what we spent on this. - No, wait really? Oh yeah, let's go. - So here's the thing though on eBay where it's what sold, these were closer to $170. - Wow. - The Slims started at $150. And, but scuffed to hell, a good looking slim there was almost $200. - This is actually a pretty solid deal. - I think, I think for $80 for this one with the larger hard drive. - And the game? - And the game. - If it functions, is this where you pitch to TikTok where people can go to the description and watch a TikTok of Matt testing to see if this works and finding out if this really is a scam or not. Wow. - Or did I scam Goodwill. I'd scam Goodwill with that? Let us know in the comments. Where do you think we should try and find some random tech next? Do we think we got a good deal? Do we think we've got a bad deal? Let us know, like subscribe, follow everywhere. Good stuff, TikTok, Instagram. - Are you just saying words now? - Yeah. (upbeat music)",

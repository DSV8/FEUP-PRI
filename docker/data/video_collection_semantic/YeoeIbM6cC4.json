And what better way to enter the UW workflow than by spendind a mere $280 USD? Let's review the LG 29UM57.

    "transcript": "The LG 29UM57, its been my daily driver for just under a year now and I have to say, I am absolutely in love with it Its been that day since day one. Now it's been replaced by the LG 29UM68-P which you can find linked in this videos description It's been enhanced in some ways, including the addition of FreeSync but it's still available for under 300 USD I created a quick review of this monitor several months ago in albeit shabby quality so I say it's time to give it an official proper review Many of you have asked for it, so here it finally is a review of the affordable 2560x1080p LG ultrawide monitor [intro music] This has got to be one of the most affordable yet usable ultrawides on the market, hands down and from a great brand, like LG I don't recommend a 25 inch ultrawide, the vertical dimension is too narrow and for what i do in the desk that i use a 34 inch ultrawide would be too wide in the horizontal At this form factor here just under 28 inches wide including the frame, mind you It isn't quite so large that the edge hangs off of my desk I will say however, that if you plan on using only one monitor for everything a 34 inch would be preferable Just much, much more expensive This is definitely the budget conscious choice, and I condone that This monitor isn't very thick either, it slightly bulges in the back but it's subtle and still gives you the impression that it's especially thin, since the back is contoured in this manner This one doesn't include built in speakers, but the 29UM68-P does and from what I read in the reviews, they're excellent for what they are The one I have includes two HDMI ports a headphone jack for audio running via HDMI and of course the power port The frame of the monitor is sleek shiny, and made of plastic, with a bold LG logo dead center on the rear and can be tilted back and forth a good ways, just not side to side, via the included rigid stand It holds the monitor upright via two screws in the neck, and four screws at the base The front of the monitor is a pleasant surprise While I would normally shun plastic, it doesn't bother me because I can't see it Sure it's on the bottom bar, along with the subtle LG logo but the bezel surrounding the sides and the top of the display are actually just matte finish continuations of what would otherwise be comprised of pixels This means you won't see any annoying light reflecting off the plastic which is good especially in the dark Below the front logo is a single pivoting controller good for selecting input modes, and customizing display settings brightness, contrast, things of that sort it is a bit awkward, i would have preferred dedicated buttons but at least it's available There isn't much of a learning curve either And now, on to the display itself This is an IPS display with a pixel resolution of 2560x1080 Pixel density is a little over 90 ppi and an anti-glare matte finish spans the entire panel Matte finishes aren't my thing usually, but this one isn't overkill and being that this monitor sits directly in front of an open window it comes in very handy Colors are crisp, vibrant, and relatively accurate Nothing close to full sRGB But for a matte finish, it's not bad And you won't notice washed out colors in the same way you would on a knockoff TFT panel Blacks decently contrast lighter zones, remember this isn't an OLED panel or anything close to that But I will say that the backlight is uniform and the bleed is very minimal, especially for a sub-300 dollar monitor The refresh rate of this monitor is a standard 60Hz Which is nothing special, it's run-of-the-mill But I will say that I was able to overclock it very easily to 75Hz and yes I can see a difference, more on that right here so, how about watching videos on an ultrawide Will they take up the total real estate offered in the 21:9 format? Well, it depends honestly In my personal experience most YouTube videos will not save ones that are customized specifically for ultrawide resolutions like this video When it comes to watching movies, whether it be online or via DVD, it's about 50/50 If the format is widescreen, chances are the moving picture will span the entire screen when the window is maximized This widescreen version of Iron Man is an example and I must say, movies are a joy to watch in this resolution It feels immersive and captivating in a way Much more exciting than the typical 16:9 aspect Now as for gaming, it's going to depend and i'll defer you to this video right here for more in-depth explanation of that Essentially, some games will, and some games won't just depends on the style of game, whether it's new or old For the most part, any new game will run in an ultrawide format, no problem Older games and first-person shooters, I've found, even games like Overwatch are a bit quirky And will either stretch the image or just cut off the top and bottom Again, it depends on the game. See that video for more of an explanation Now, in terms of content creation ultrawides are 100% the way to go Take it from someone like myself And, if you're willing to take the chance, ultrawides will even pay off when gaming It will ultimately come down to preference But when you consider the fact that a monitor like this sells for under 300 bucks you really won't be losing much, you'll just be gaining quite a bit of horizontal real estate Even if you already own a 1080p panel, i would argue that upgrading to just 1080 ultrawide is beneficial, and worth your while If you liked this video, be sure to give it a thumbs up Give it a thumbs down, if you feel the complete opposite And subscribe for more content like this stay tuned for a review of the G.SKILL keyboard and mouse combo as well as an AKRacing chair somewhere back there and don't forget about our RAM test coming up very soon Compiling a bunch of data for that video This is Science Studio Thanks for learning with us [outro music]",

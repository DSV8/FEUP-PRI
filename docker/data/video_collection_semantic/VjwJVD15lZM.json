    "transcript": "- It is 4:31, it's 4:31, Jen. We are in San Jose for WWDC and the Cupertino Apple store closes at five o'clock. Right now it is 4:31 so what we're trying to do is we're trying to do a little WWDC pre game. We're trying to get to the store before it closes. I'm shaking 'cause I don't think we're gonna make it in time. - [Jennae] Uber's here. - It is? You've never even been here before. - [Jennae] No. - Ah, this is actually my first WWDC. This is also Jennae's first WWDC but it's gonna be her first time at the Cupertino Apple store. Come on, come on, come on. Look, look, look. Do you see it? It's in the city of Cupertino. This is where I wanted to live when I was in sixth grade. Alright, we made it. Hello! - How are you? - Hi! Good, how are you? We're actually at the one infinite loop Apple store right now and there's also the Apple visitor center, which we went to when the iPhone 10 was launched, that closes at six o'clock. This one closes at five so we're gonna go here first and then we're gonna go to the other one so come on, let's go. Should I get a new watch band for tomorrow? What will look good on me? That looks really nice. What do you think of this one? Which one do you like better? Or do I use this case for tomorrow? What am I going to wear? - [Jennae] That's fancy. - So these shirts are exclusive to this store. This is the original 1984 classic Mac, which I just bought one from eBay so I'm gonna be wearing this shirt when I actually unbox it. The best part about this Mac is the 128K and 512, they have the entire Apple team's signatures in the back of it. This is such a cool design. Do you want an Apple watch band, Jen, I'll get you a present for your birthday. Oh my gosh, they have pens and notebooks and mugs. They also have a rose gold Apple pen. What do I do? Do I get a mug, do I get a pen? - [Jennae] Shoulda brought a bigger suitcase. - Rustic. So I'm testing out the pen and I'm going to leave my mark. Oh wow, it writes very nice. - [Jennae] Should write the date. - Sounds like a good idea, Jen. Dub DC on eight. How am I going to carry all of this stuff home because I don't have enough room. - [Jennae] We'll figure it out, we'll figure it out. - They're officially closed, they've been closed for two minutes. I might wear this tee shirt tomorrow. It's like I'm talking to myself, I'm actually looking at Jennae but it might look like that I'm looking at you guys. Okay, I gotta get a picture, I'm gonna put it side by side from the first time that I took a picture here. It was probably like 2007, 2008? I just found all of these old pictures on my old laptop and let me tell you, it was wild. - [Jennae] You blend in. - Okay, it's 5:14. This next Apple store, which is the visitors center closes at six o'clock. We got our first bag of purchases. Oh, I can't wait. I forgot that we wanted to get those Apple watch bands. - [Jennae] There was no time. - Good thing we're going to another store. Wow look it, oh my goodness. - [Driver] I wish you guys a great day. - [Jennae] Thank you. - Thank you, you too. - [Driver] Take care. - Yes, oh my goodness. We made it to the visitor's center. So let's go take a look inside. This place is so beautiful. He said they just extended their hours so if they wouldn't have extended their hours, they woulda been closed. Welcome, welcome inside. I think I should get a bag to put all the things in that I've purchased. What do you think? Do we know anybody that has a baby? - [Jennae] No. - Hi. Say hi to my vlog. She just said I'm the best vlogger so you guys, you heard it here first, it's official and for meeting in the Apple store. - Yeah, that's right. I'm so excited. (laughing) - It's so nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. - You too, yes. I'll see you. - Okay. - This is so great, I'm having the best time. (speaking foreign language) - [Woman] You have to say hi in (speaking foreign language) - I don't know how but I'm gonna say it wrong. - [Woman] Mela - Mela. - [Woman] Morci. - Melamorci. - [Woman] Cata. - Cata. - [Jennae] This is my favorite color. - This is your favorite color and this is my favorite color. Wow. Those look so good. We should get these Apple watch bands though. I think they'll look really good 'cause they do have those. - [Jennae] This is my favorite color. - This is my favorite color. I'm gonna get you a gift. - [Jennae] You already got me a gift. - Do you want a gift? I'm gonna get Jen a gift. A gift for Jennae, gift for Justine. - I lost Justine. I have to find her. Oh, found her, she's the one carrying all the things, I'm sorry. - We should get like a snack at the Mac cafe. - [Jennae] Always. - Oh my God, I'm having really, a really, really fun time. - [Jennae] Is everything like Apple flavors? - No, it's not. Lovely news, they actually close at seven. We though they closed at six. So we're gonna do. - [Jennae] Seven? - Seven. - [Jennae] Whoa. - Yeah I know, we're gonna do the Mac cafe, then I'm gonna take you upstairs on the roof to get a really cool panoramic picture and then I'm gonna take you into the other, last room, which is a surprise. Do you want some like, they have almonds. Oh look, we should go, oh what should we get? So here we have the menu on an iPad, what would you like, Jen? - [Jennae] What would I like, what's something Jennae would like? - Nitro cold brew? I have a coffee already, I probably shouldn't get another one. Okay, I'll just do that. - [Worker] That's fine. - Okay we're gonna sample this chocolate. This is a macha chocolate. It's really hot in the sun, like crazy. - [Jennae] Eat it fast or it'll melt. - Oh that is a lovely taste. Here, you try this one. - Okay. Oh this is nice, the milk chocolate. - [Justine] You gotta try that. - Okay. No pressure. Do you want half? - [Justine] No I'm good, thank you. - Wow. - [Justine] Really good. - Oh my, oh it's lovely. - Let's go to the roof, roof. I mean this store is just incredible. Hello. Hi. (chattering) Yes, oh yes, I'll see you. Here it is. Wow, it's so pretty. I don't have anything else to say. We're at the roof. Here's the view. Okay so we're leaving the upstairs and now we're heading down and they have an entire 3D rendering of the Apple campus. You use the iPad and so using AR, you can scan the entire campus and it'll do really cool animations. I showed you guys this before in my previous video but Jennae hasn't seen it. And that's it, that's a wrap on our San Jose, Cupertino Apple store visit. WWDC coming up very, very soon. Oh boy, I can't wait to put on my new Apple watch band. I'm so happy. Okay, that's the end of the video, bye. (lively music)",

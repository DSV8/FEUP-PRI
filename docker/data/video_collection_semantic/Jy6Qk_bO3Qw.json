    "transcript": "This seems safe. Okay, a few weeks ago, I'm browsing Facebook marketplace and I stumble across this. A once top of the line NetApp storage appliance that would have cost around $100,000 new for five grand. And it gets even better. We lowballed them offering just $1,000. And they said, yes, that's how desperate they were to get rid of this thing. Which raises some interesting questions. Like, why? Does it even work? I didn't follow my own advice and actually power it on before we carted it away. So for all I know, it's completely dead. And even if it's not dead, is it so slow by modern standards that it really is only worth 1% of what they originally paid for it? Is there some way that we could deproprietary-ify this thing and roll it as commodity storage hardware? We're gonna have the answers to those questions and more after this message from our sponsor. Unbounce, engage your audience with beautiful high-performing marketing campaigns in just a few minutes with Unbounce's AI powered landing page builder. Unbounce on over to the link below and get up to 35% off. For those who missed part one of our adventure, let's take a quick look at what we've got here. A NetApp storage appliance is not that dissimilar to the kind of NAS that you would build for yourself. Just everything about it is enterprise grade. Instead of having a single box that contains everything though, it's split out. So we've got this box here that contains our brain or our controller for the appliance. And then this particular configuration has four 24 bay disc shelves, which are, as the name implies, shelves that hold discs. These ones in particular have 600 gigabyte, 15,000 RPM SAS drives in them, and then just power supplies at the back in order to power them. But here's the thing, a hard drive is not very useful without a data connection. But remember how I said these were SAS? You can think of SAS as kind of like the enterprise big brother of SATA. And each of these drives is connected to a backplane inside our disc shelf that is then connected to our controller through an external cable. Those of you who have been paying very close attention will know that this is almost exactly like our mother vault server. Keyword being almost. Unlike the mother vault, which only has a single controller because it doesn't host mission critical data, this is designed for what's called high availability, which means that no matter what in this configuration fails, there should be something ready to pick up the slack immediately so that there's no interruption to your business. And it starts with, of course, the controller box, which contains not one, but actually two separate servers, each of which needs to be connected to every single one of these JBODs. See like that? Then there's the JBODs themselves, which contain redundant power supplies. So I could literally rip this out mid operation and it would keep working. Contain redundant controllers so I could have a controller failure and every drive in there would still work and even have two separate cables connected to every drive. With all of that said, the reason I got this at e-waste pricing is because it kinda is. And not just because of its age. You see, NetApp locks down their systems so that you can only use them with drives that have customized NetApp firmware. And I'm sure they'll tell you that this is for your own benefit in some way, but the real reason they do this is to ensure that you won't be able to take advantage of the ever falling pricing of commodity hard drives and you will have to pay the NetApp tax forever. With that said though, if we abandon the NetApp controller, which frankly isn't very performant or power efficient these days anyway, we should be able to use these disk shelf JBODs with practically any server or even a desktop computer, which makes these things pretty valuable in the home lab community as a cheap way to run a bunch of hard drives. All we need is some adapter cables, a controller server and an HBA to plug into. But we're getting ahead of ourselves a little bit. You see, neither Jake nor I has ever gotten a chance to play with NetApp anything. And despite paying $1,000 for the entire get up, we haven't powered it on. So why don't we start by taking a look at how it's supposed to run? The first thing we'll need to do is wire this up properly. What I did earlier was just for illustrative purposes, these both need to come out. So we'll start by taking the leftmost port on each of our servers. And I apologize, earlier I referred to these as controllers and they are in a sense, cause they're the controller for the entire storage appliance, but these are also SAS controllers. So I'm just gonna call these servers and these controllers moving forward. I plug each of these into the two controllers on the top JBOD, just like that. Then one by one, top to top, bottom to bottom, I daisy chain in each of the additional controllers. Then once we reach the bottom JBOD, we actually loop that one back up around to the servers. And the reason for this is that if there's a failure at any point in the chain, it can just go, oh, well, I'll just come at it that way. There is four power supplies per disc shelf. You technically only need to plug in the top and the bottom so that both controllers are powered. Wow, that's loud. I hope that spins down later. Yeah, she goes. No power buttons on this. Wait, is this one bad? Maybe it's just not plugged in. Oh, wait, hold on. Is it not plugged in? Yeah, those are the same lights that are bad on the ones that are unplugged. Okay. Does it push it in maybe? Oh no, it's in there. Try the other side? Yeah, I'll try the other side. Oh, did you just not turn the switch on? Oh, you just didn't turn the switch on? Oh, I missed the switch on that one. There you go. My defense, it took you a minute to see that switch too. It's right under the thing. Well, I mean, in my defense, you were flipping all the other switches. It'd be kind of weird to miss them. I can't really serial into both of these at the same time, so I'm hoping one is enough. You think the top one is the primary, right? You'd think. All right, let's try that. The only link lights that are not illuminated are the ones that are coming straight from the servers. If it's not booting up, that makes sense. I also don't know, does it need boot drives? Did they take boot drives out? In theory, we should have serial even at the BIOS, so let's try that, I guess. Okay, it looks like it's doing things. NVRD1, I'm assuming that's like the non-volatile DIMM. Interface E5A, E5B does not exist. Were all those management ports plugged in? It wasn't in their server room anymore, so they wouldn't be. Nothing plugged in here. I really don't know if it needs boot drives. Oh, hey, look, here's all the instruction manuals. They still have them on their website. Oh my God. Wow, baby's first storage appliance. Plastered data for seven mode. 10 gig ethernet ports, so that makes sense. We have those plugged in between. We have our SAS ports, that's right. Connect gig ports, blah, blah, blah, to gig data network switches, okay. All power cords must be used for all units. Yeah, whatever. What's the point of even having a manual? Okay, so the whole thing has to be daisy chained. Every single JBOD. So the farthest drives from the actual SAS controller. It's just because if one connection dies, or like something goes wrong, the connection can come back the other way. Okay, well, we can fix that. Let's flip the power switch. Okay, now we get to do it all over again with ethernet. Ah, yes, the locked wrench port. Locked wrench port to the first ones. Ah, good, quite. I screwed up one of mine. What? It goes top to bottom, then bottom to top. So I just got to do a quick switchy-boo here. Okay, those are blinky, that's good. Oh, wait, what? How did I end up? Oh God. We're still not getting a link light back to the server. Well, it's not booted, so. Oh, the link lights are up. It's doing stuff. Yeah, something is happening now. Failover monitor: takeover disabled, blah, blah, blah. It's doing things. But these controller nodes each have a two port 10 gig card in there. We didn't account for that in our like money. Oh yeah, right. Those are worth like 50, 100 bucks each. I think we did pretty well here in spite of the fact that they ended up telling us after the fact that the $5,000 listing was a typo. They had intended $500. System was down for 5.3 million seconds. What the hell is that? That's saying that was the last time it was on. Well, no, I. Oh, it's blinking. It's got internet even. Oh my God, what is the login? Install and run system setup software. Oh, register and get your license keys. Maybe you can download this part of it. We could maybe be able to download the system setup one, but anything further than that, I doubt. Download system setup 3.1 or later. 2015 was the last time this was updated. Crud. Oh no. We wanted to check the power consumption because 60 terabytes or whatever. What does it work out to? Yeah, really it's only 60 terabytes. Yeah, and you don't actually get all of it. Some of the capacity, I think minimum three disks have to be used for each node to host their OS. So the reason it wouldn't turn on after talking to leadeater on the forum, he's one of our forum admins. Shout out leadeater. The OS is stored on the array. If you move the disk shelves around and change the cables and move the disks around, yeah. Okay, fine. 45 terabytes. Whatever the capacity ends up being. That's not a bad thing. You know, I wouldn't mind, you know, tens of terabytes of storage, but at what cost? These days, you could get literally two hard drives and that would be a total of what? Like 15, 20 Watts? Yeah. The cost of running this compared to buying two or three new hard drives. This takes a while to turn off. Yeah, it is off sort of. It shuts off the OS and it goes back to the loader, which is like the bootloader menu. And I guess that's as off as it goes. And then you just click the button, I guess. So yesterday, trying to get it set back up, cleared the config and initialized all the disks, which is just one command, but that means it has to zero every single disk. And since this is on an old operating system, it zeroed like sequentially and did that overnight. Oh, here's the other thing. If you update it from the older version to the newer version, fast zero doesn't work. You have to fresh install. In theory, this one can be updated to a version that has fast zero, but we can't download the software because we don't have a license. I emailed them and said, hey, we bought this from X company, but they said, oh, you didn't purchase it from NetApp. So we can't give you access. So it literally is e-waste basically. All I'm saying is it should be illegal to sell hardware that requires software that you need an account to access. All right, let's go. Three amps. A 208 volt. Whoa. Holy crap, it's drawing 1,600 Watts right now. Eight fricking amps. For one year, it will cost us $2,000 in electricity here, where electricity is like 13 cents a kilowatt Canadian, which is like 10 cents a kilowatt US. So six grand a year in California, 10 grand a year in Europe. Whoa, look at how like archaic that PCB is on the back. Well, yeah. It kind of looks like carbon fiber. Oh man, look at that. That is just like industrial AF. We're not going to destroy all these drives. If somebody in the comments, you want them for your NetApp and you live locally and you want to just come pick them up and take them out of all of these trays, maybe you can have them. Well, NetApp is on now. Do you want to take a quick look at it? I do. This is quite the journey to get working. So after I installed and zeroed all the drives, I booted up the second node, which was still crashing, and had to do the same thing. Luckily it only zeroed three drives and it took like an hour. And here we are. We have old school cool bottom and top. Once you set up the cluster on the first node, after it's reinstalled itself, you can then reinstall the second node, join that to the cluster, but wait, it's not high availability yet. You have to go in and like type a command that allows it to be high availability, like turn high availability on. Otherwise it's just two separate nodes. So in theory now, both nodes can perform takeover on each other. It used to be that you needed a base license to even use the software at all. They've changed that. So you can install it, but to do basically anything, SIFs like SMB, NFS, iSCSI, you need a feature license and NetApp won't give it to me because we're not the owner. Yeah, basically right now, this is just an expensive storage device that you can't really put anything on, as far as I can tell. Cause here, like I made a aggregate, which is like a pool. And then I made an SVM. Seriously, I was about right. We only have 45 terabytes of actual addressable space. Which is a storage virtual machine. You go to edit and I want to turn on SIFs, which is SMB. Okay, and it's just grayed out. You can see the cluster base license is deprecated, but all of these other things, you want to use any of these features, you need a license because we didn't buy it from them or a reseller. Oh, hey, look, a hard drive. Look how small the platter is. So the reason for that is that a smaller platter actually gives you faster seek times because the arm doesn't have to move as far to find the correct track. That's one of the reasons that these high-performance SAS drives in appliances like this used smaller disc platters. The bigger the platter gets, the more actual area that is. After all of that work to get this thing to work, it still doesn't really work. Let's do what we intended to do then and try and repurpose this hardware. Okay, cool. I get to run that fun really long command again to turn it off. Classic Jake. See you later. And the like condescending attitude of the people who have told me how stupid I am over the years for not buying one of these. Yeah. Nothing we have is that mission critical, especially when the cost is so high that you could literally hire a person to come in and deal with it for you. Hey. Do you need a hand? Whoa, I forgot about the handles. Whoa. Hey, hey, how you doing? Yeah, this is the most junk part of the whole thing, I think. Easily worth a thousand bucks right here. Mm-hmm. Even if we just give them away at the Christmas party. And then what did you have in mind for a replacement? What now? We're gonna put old Wannock in there. Oh my God. What is it? Like dual high performance 32 cores or is that one dual 64? It's dual 7702 64 cores. Okay. I don't know if this is ever what Liquid intended this thing to be, but. No, I think they really didn't intend for hard drives. The first thing you're gonna need to make a disc shelf like this work with a different computer is an HBA or host bus adapter. This is effectively just a storage controller on a PCIe card. Like what would be on your motherboard, just separate. This one is a 930516I, the I standing for internal. You can see that these are internal connectors. I see the problem here. This is not what you should buy. You should buy one that ends in E for external, which has the proper external mini SAS HD connectors. We just had a bunch of these laying around and StarTech makes these internal to external adapters, so. This is really janky. It's not that bad. Okay, it's not that great. Enterprise grade hardware that literally looks like someone hand soldered the wires onto the PCB. I mean, why have a housing and a connector when you can just do this and put hot glue over it? You'll notice this card has four connections and we have two of these adapter things. That's because we have four disc shelves. You could cascade them and have one cable that goes to all of them. I don't really have the right cable. Actually, no, we could reuse them. We could reuse their cables. It's slower to do that though. Yes. We would rather have more bandwidth. This means we have a full connection to each of them. I maintain it won't matter. For the use case. What for what use case? Where you're going to be more limited by your random IO. Re-silver, replacing a disc. Okay, in fairness to you, this ended up being less stupid than I expected. Yeah, it's really not that bad. Get kicked. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Stop kicking, stop. The one that we got uses IOM three controller modules. Those are SAS three gigabit. Luckily you can buy IOM six modules, which are SAS six gigabit, which doubles our throughput. They were- How much money did we waste on those? 20 bucks. Oh, they're 20 bucks each. Wow, that's cheap. And we technically only need one as far as I'm aware. The good news is that the upgrade process is as simple as, oop. So I'll pull out old ones. You put in new ones? Yeah. Woo, upgraded. Beautiful. Now we have double the bandwidth, double the throughput. These are QSFP, which is what the net app uses to mini SAS HD, which is like the modern external SAS cable. I don't know if anything other than these use QSFP because this is usually a network cable connector, like for 40 gig or a hundred gig networking. Yeah, I mean, in theory, it's anything that needs a lot of pins. Oi. This handle feels like it's not strong enough for this. It really does. It's flexing so hard. Not as hard as I'm flexing, man. Hold on, they've got that plastic thing. Who cares about the plastic power cable? No, I just, it might've interfered with the- No, it would have been fine. It might not have been. This thing's like a hundred pounds. Linus actually dropped one of these a foot off the ground onto pavement. And all the drives still work? I mean, seemingly. Wow. Wiggle while you work. Do do do do do do do do. Look at how mint that is, buddy. I mean, from this side. It's mint. I really hope this just works. I don't think it's gonna just work. Really? Why wait for Jake when I can just turn it on myself? Boot failed. Just give it a sec, just give it a sec. Oh, okay. I just didn't change the boot order. Oh no, my hundred useless capacity high wattage drives aren't all detected. Oh no. Oh, I think we only got one shelf. Yeah, we have one. Okay. How do we know which one it is though? Oh, I have no idea. Do an identify thing on the thing and I'll tell you what light flashes. Oh yeah, look at that. Show me an access. Let's go. Hey, it's the top one. Are they all on? Yep, all good. I wanna point out that as much as we're mocking the power efficiency of the original setup, only a small part of the problem was the server itself. And now that we're running a new server, that's not a problem at all. Also, the power efficiency of these disc shelves is only a problem if the capacity is super low. If we were to put 22 terabyte drives in this thing, obviously these power supplies aren't quite as efficient as something modern, you know, 80 plus titanium would be, but your energy usage per capacity would actually be much more reasonable and could even be worth the cost savings if you were trying to set up a very low cost bulk storage solution for a small business. Honestly, if something like this had existed back when we started, just cheap JBOD disc shelves like this, I would have totally gone this route. They existed, they just weren't low cost. Hey, some of these drives are different capacity, 556.29 and 555.63. That actually makes sense because some of them are the two and a half inch replacement drives and they would be ever so slightly different, even though they're both 600 gigabytes. Failed to wipe disc, invalid argument. I mean, that's the whole point of their locked off firmware BS. But why would they care if you put these discs into something else? Because... See you later, buddy. Noctua edition screwdriver coming soon. You can sign up for an in-stock notification on lttstore.com, two colorways. This is interesting. The two and a half inch drives have a little adapter majig. Oh, it's just a height adapter. They got a screw in from the bottom. I have a thing for that. Hey, oh, interesting. This is an interposer. We don't need these. A benefit of using an interposer like this is that you can use SAS-ish signaling up until the interposer and then it converts to SATA right at the drive. And this has the added benefit of allowing both controllers to see the drive, which is super cool. But the thing is most SAS controllers can read SATA drives. It doesn't work the other way around. You cannot run a SAS drive on a SATA controller. Well, without an interposer, at least you cannot. But the point is we don't need an interposer to read these drives necessarily. It just is a little better. One thing that's a little bit confusing, are there two separate mounting hole? There are, there's two separate mounting holes on these sleds because they are interposer ready. Wow, that's pretty cool. We don't have that many spare drives right now, but the drives that we're going to be using, 22 terabytes. It's still only detecting 25 disks. Im gonna call Wendell. Hello, hello, is this level one tech support? Well, technically it's level two. So we got those disks shelves set up. They're all into the same HBA and it only seems to detect one of them. Have you got them set to different IDs? Yeah, the one it detected is four. If you're not gonna Davy chain them diamond hole, like diamond hole on each controller from each shelf is just straight into its own controller or its own channel on a controller. So like I've got a four channel controller and so like two shelves into four connectors. I have a 9305-16i HBA, that's what they're plugged into. Double check those are okay because unless something weird is going on, it should be pretty plug and play. How do you change the IDs? Maybe it's just mad because the IDs aren't sequential. I think you can change the IDs by hitting the button on the front. Wendell suggested that part of our problem might be these disk shelves complaining about having 15,000 RPM drives in them with only two of the power supplies plugged in because the 15K drives use so much more power, it'll force you to use staggered startup and you gotta have three out of the four power supplies for 15K. So we are trying to plug in a third power supply for each of our shelves to see if this resolves this just weird issue where the top one is detecting drives but the other three are not. Here, SCS utils show, it still just shows the one. It's only detecting seven drives from that one. Have you got all your green lights on the front? All the lights are up on the front. There was some kernel messaging happening when we were unplugging and plugging in enclosures which makes me think that things are happening but it really just wasn't detecting anything. Like you run SCS util and it still would only show the one enclosure. After talking to Wendell for a while, it's become pretty clear that regardless of how we had this thing hooked up directly to each disk shelf or into one and cascaded down to the others, this should just work. There isn't really any config that needs to happen to make this work. And it turns out it should have been. Wendell set up at home is running Rocky Linux which is different than FreeBSD which is what TrueNAS Core is based on. On the off chance that it might work, we decided to upgrade to TrueNAS Scale which is actually based on Linux. And as soon as it turned on, I immediately saw all the drives start populating. So I guess it's an issue with TrueNAS Core which is a little bit ironic because I specifically chose that thinking that it would be more reliable and better suited for this and it turns out it is not. The weird thing is they show as disk size zero. I think it's because of the weird sector size. These drives with the special NetApp firmware use a 520 byte sector size which is not standard for most computers but it does turn out you can change them. I'm running it on this one right now. It's probably been going for like 10 minutes already and it's at 45% or something like that. You can do multiple at a time. So it's not gonna take like a week to do all of these drives but I'm also not gonna do all these drives. They're really not that useful for us. I just wanted to demo it on one. So we'll see when that's finished and see if it works. But in the meantime, why don't we throw in these 22 terabyte drives? I grabbed eight of them and set them up on the trays with the interposer so we can do two per disk shelf. The other thing that's important about this, while you can use SATA drives with these disk shelves, when you have SATA drives and SAS drives on the same backplane, it's really not recommended because the voltage level is different between SAS and SATA. So using interposers in a mixed setup like this is very recommended. I'm not even gonna try and put just a SATA drive in here cause I don't wanna damage anything. Oh, luckily I have this like server shelf here. When I set up my server at home, I really wanted to get one of these disk shelves but they're like, particularly in Canada, it's like, oh, 300 bucks on eBay plus $700 shipping. Like what? They're blinking. That's a good sign. Let's go see if it works. It takes a sec for them to populate but I can already see the number is increasing. We're on 87, 88. There's another one popping up. This is still going 45, 8%. Hi. Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Hey, look at that. Plus we have a direct connection to each J-BOD which means we have like, not 48, that would be 12. We have 24 gigabit to each disk shelf which is two and a half gigabytes a second, something like that. Which is more than two drives will do. Hey look, it works. There we go, okay. Managed devices, look at that. All that's left to do is create a data set and then a share so we can access it. I'm gonna change it also to Z standard compression. We have a lot of CPU in this server, 128 epic cores. And that's just gonna serve to make our disks go faster. So there's really not really a lot of downside. I heard we switched to true NAS scale. Yup. How often have you started on core lately for the better reliability and more maturity and then ended up on scale? I don't know what it is. Core very much seems to be built for like IX systems which is a company that makes true NAS. Yeah. The hardware that they sell these days and scale, you know, it's Linux. It kind of just works with everything. And sure enough, as soon as we booted it up, it was like, wow, look at all these disks. Really, that easy. Right now I'm just plugging in that test bench way the hell over there to 10 gigs so we can like do a file transfer. I called it, the pool is called sort of slow. This is wifi. Oh. And then the data set is sort of fast. We're directly connected to the server over there via 200 foot Cat 6A cable now to this workstation, which has a 10 gig NIC in it. We have two 22 terabyte hard drives in each. It should be able to hit about a gig by itself. It should be fine. Okay. Wow. That's reading from it immediately. 1.1 gigabytes a second. It just saturated a 10 gigabit link. I mean, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. It's still not bad. Yeah, okay. 600 megabytes a second. I mean, it did like five gigs before it slowed down. That's probably just a little bit of RAM caching there. It's nothing to be too concerned about. This is a video file as well, so it's not compressible. So even though we have compression enabled over there, it's really not doing anything. If we were to copy a bunch of- Big word documents. Big spreadsheets. Yeah. Go. It's worth noting that even though we got a great deal on these drive shelves, if all you need is a hundred terabytes of storage or less, you don't need to do any of this stuff with a basic consumer motherboard and consumer chassis. You can do anywhere from four to eight hard drives pretty easily and spend a fraction of what we did here and just direct attach them all. It'll work just as well with the free or inexpensive software we already mentioned. And you don't have to deal with the noise of an enterprise oriented solution. That being said, if you do want more capacity like this, I'm one of those people. Getting one of these disc shelves, you can probably find one on eBay if you're lucky for two, 300 bucks, maybe even with the new modules. You need an HBA, which you can buy Chinese ones for a couple of hundred bucks and then a cable. That's basically it. Yeah. And your drives. And you're ready to hang out on our slash data hoarders. Yeah. Assuming that subreddit is still up these days. You know what is up? The segue to our sponsor. Delete me. Your personal information is out on the web being passed around between companies like hors d'oeuvres at a fancy party and it's time to stop with a little help from delete me. Delete me will help you find and remove hundreds of online profiles sharing your personal info. So it can't be used by spammers, scammers, and even slammers. I don't know what those are, but they sound bad. In more extreme cases, bad actors having your data could lead to identity theft or fraud. Removing all of this information by yourself would be a huge task and take many hours. But with delete me software and team of experts, it can be done in minutes. On average delete me finds and removes over 2000 pieces of data for a customer in their first two years. So if you want to get your personal information removed from search results on the web, go to join delete me.com slash Linus tech tips and use code LTT for 20% off. Okay, if you guys enjoyed this video, I think the best one to go check out is setting up the mother vault. These are so quiet. You can have that under your bed. No.",

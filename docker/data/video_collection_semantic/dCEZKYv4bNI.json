    "transcript": "This here is another viewer's broken gaming pc it apparently turns on but doesn't send a picture out my oh my we've been seeing this symptom a lot lately and this coming straight from the owner i'm emailing you because my computer currently does not boot and i have tried multiple ways to troubleshoot but nothing has worked that's never a good sign oh okay i remember this email now so i kind of combed through it before i agreed to try to fix it for him i i remember he switched from a core i3 9100f to a Ryzen 5 5600x which of course requires an entire platform swap to swap the motherboard and the cpu and he said it was running just fine at first but then something crashed and it's never worked since then i wonder i wonder if he even bothered reinstalling windows when he made that platform swap because jumping from anything intel to anything AMD or vice versa without completely reinstalling windows on that primary boot drive is gonna cause some problems and that was something i asked him right away before i even agreed to fix it i asked when you switched from intel to AMD did you reinstall windows and his response was no i did not was i supposed to this owner has tried q flash flashing different bios's he's resetted the CMOS he's even replaced his power supply he's gone through so much trying to get this thing to work i feel bad because that's a lot of work and what i think this is going to come down to is software i think he's just because he's swapped platforms and kind of just shocked the boot drive and the drivers that are set up around a particular platform he's running into serious issues that are preventing a system at this point from turning on now that's a pretty severe case usually you'll just see performance hits but for that to keep the system from powering on there might be something else on the dl going on so we'll give you know the system the full run through on the hardware side of things but i think at the end of the day we're definitely going to have to reinstall windows on the boot drive we might even upgrade them actually you know what that's a good idea let's just swap out his boot drive for an even better one so the current drive in this viewer's rig is a 500 gig two and a half inch ssd sata drive say to speeds uh this drive here from crucial mx 500 is a one terabyte drive so it's got double the capacity uh it is still limited of course by the sata interface still two and a half inch drive but that double capacity means that he can store extra games on it and the like and since i'm also going to be setting this up as a boot drive for him he can take that ssd that's currently in his rig and either transfer important files from it and then bring those to this drive or you can just repurpose that for some other build give it to a friend a family member whatever he wants my goal with this upgrade is to give him a bit of breathing room because at the end of the day he'll need to either reformat the current drive or set up an entirely new drive as a boot device since he migrated everything when he shouldn't have from intel to AMD now i don't think we'll need to upgrade anything else i've taken a look at the other components and the balance seems okay so out of necessity i think just the ssd will need to be swapped out i did notice though that his fans are all flipped backwards including the exhaust at the rear well which should be an exhaust it's actually set to intake as are the two top fans he has three intake fans in places where you wouldn't expect intake fans and then the two fans up front here are actually set to exhaust i think the rationale here centered on the fact that this case doesn't have a perforated front panel it's completely sealed off and we just have ventil on the sides so maybe he thought well it's just gonna be easier for air to be pulled in from the top and back and that might be the case you might save a few degrees celsius in the long run but you're also inviting dust and the system despite it being relatively new already has quite a bit of dust kicked up on especially the fan blades themselves that are set to intake at the top and rear so i'm going to flip all this back around i think at the end of the day you're still going to have quite a bit of resistance up front whether you're exhausting or in taking air so just to save him a bit of breathing room i will save his components a bit of breathing room when dust gathers in here in the long term i'm going to swap all this backwards for him he's also got the cpu fan set to exhaust this way it's really weird it's all backwards i'm sure it'd be fine like from a functional standpoint but it all just looks very weird i don't really uh i don't really think it's the way to go if i was building this system myself i would have swapped everything back into the conventional layout so we'll take care of that and then we'll also get that ssd in here and then assuming we can get the build to post after whatever we do to fix it he'll be good to go so with all that out of the way let's get into the troubleshooting process stay with me if you're a frequent traveler or public wi-fi user you should probably consider using a virtual private network qn nordvpn a leading vpn service see vpns provide secure and encrypted tunnels for your online traffic they mask your iep and keep browsing histories totally private nordvpn offers an unbeatable combination of impenetrable security fast connection and unlimited bandwidth and it can all be done with just a single click you can even work around location dependent restrictions with it see when i'm traveling in Europe to see the wife's family a lot of the shows i like to watch aren't supposed to be seen over there at least that's what the streaming services want you to think but with nordvpn one click means i can tunnel back through secure us servers so to those streaming services it's like i never even left nor vpn has over 50 100 servers in fact in 60 countries so you've plenty to choose from depending on the circumstance for either your phone tablet or pc to get started today with a special cyber month deal offered for a limited time visit nordvpn.com/GregSalazar or click the link below and you get a two-year plan plus special gift at a huge discount so for those who are new to the fixer-flop playlist the premise here is simple the goal is to fix viewer systems in and around the Orlando Florida area for free we don't charge them a dime so long as they're okay with us taking in their systems for a few days and filming with them i make money by monetizing these youtube videos and i don't feel like offloading any of that cost to the viewers who are already gracious enough to loan me their systems for a few days and since we've already more or less addressed part of this rick's problem that being the transfer of an operating system from one platform to another from intel to AMD more specifically which is a big no-no unless you want driver conflicts blue screens of death and performance hits all of that has been documented by us here in the studio and i'm sure others have seen that as well um apart from that the other thing we need to fix is the more obvious issue which is that apparently this thing doesn't post so let's begin the troubleshooting process by attempting to replicate that issue the issue described by the owner if we don't get a post but we get everything else powering on well at least we're on the same page as the viewer so we've got the system connected to power we've got the HDMI cable connected to our portable monitor let's flick the switch at the rear and attempt to power this bad boy on whoa fan curve is maxed out there i wonder what's gonna happen it works it works just fine um let me talk to the owner right so here's the situation i emailed tyler the owner of the system and this is important here i didn't let him know the system powered on at this point i had just asked him to elaborate on the issue at hand i wanted to see if he could give me any more info and he told me that the system would power on the fans would spin everything would light up but no matter what he tried he could not get a picture out that i checked was consistent with what he sent earlier in the email chain now the next kicker i wanted to see if he was fishing for maybe a free upgrade or something because i know that's something that a lot of people expect going into this but you have to have a genuine problem in order to actually qualify so if you were just lying for the sake of getting an upgrade you're not going to get an upgrade that's not how it works here and i will call you out on it if i suspect that so my next response i it was it was tactical i i told him tacticful is that a word i i told him that it powers on just fine for me dot dot dot that's all i said i said everything works just fine and i wanted to gauge his response his response was actually a breath of fresh air all he said was wow that's actually really surprising didn't see that coming but uh i apologize for wasting your time i didn't mean to to yeah you know make you drive out and meet me and uh attempt to film a video for a system that actually works that's my bad i can pick it up at your earliest convenience um that and it just was what he said in that reply and that was all i needed to hear because at that point if he was willing to just pick the system back up he's not fishing for an upgrade if he was he wouldn't have offered first off to pick it up right away and he also probably wouldn't have apologized for quote-unquote wasting my time even though he hasn't we can still make a really good video on this topic here of transferring an ssd from an AMD or intel platform to the opposite platform that is no good and i'm going to show you why right now so this here is Cinebench r23 the latest in a bench release and you can see we've got his Ryzen 5 5600x detected that six chorus 12 thread zen three architecture really really efficient very powerful zen three cores here and i believe the cpu is running at stock now i've gone through and disabled a lot of background tasks we've got a few things open still that i need to close but i'm going to run the Cinebench test just the multi-core test because i don't really want to wait too long for the single core test to play itself out and then we're going to reinstall windows on again that newer crucial ssd i showed you a bit earlier in this video and we're going to see how this score changes i expect that we'll see a pretty healthy bump in just this sentiment score alone and that's a result of again less conflicting drivers just a cleaner install not as much stuff that's kind of uh affecting the ability for the cpu to perform at its best so here we go we're going to run the multi-core test we'll click the start button and let's fast forward to the end and as things wrap up here you can see our score is 11 281 so i want you to keep this number in the back of your head we'll show it obviously later the only thing we're going to do now is install windows on a separate ssd that we connect to is build we're going to install Cinebench r23 on top of that remember we disabled all kinds of background tasks and things so there shouldn't be much of a delta there and then we're going to re-run this test and see how much different our score ends up being and just to be even more thorough we'll also run youtube in superposition to see what's going on with the graphics side of things everything's kind of um too large you can see this like this window just to start the benchmark is a little too big for this 1080p screen so he might have the incorrect drivers installed for this machine i'm not uh not too sure we're gonna run the benchmark before and after anyway because uh wow this is what this owner would have experienced prior to us taking a look at it so here we go now this crucial ssd is gonna be the only ssd in this build i've thought about leaving his old ssd connected to his rig but i'm not sure how familiar this owner is with computers and he might accidentally end up booting into that ssd uh over this one and i don't want that so i'm going to remove that one and give it to him so that he can install it if he wants later and transfer files need be so we'll just disconnect this drive and remove it from his build and we'll connect the new drive keeping everything else exactly the same so we've got sata tower and then sata data right here and we'll just tighten it down with a thumb screw now installing a fresh copy of windows is actually fairly simple we have a dedicated video outlining that process in this video's description to check out if you're interested but in this one i'll give you a brief synopsis first you want to download the windows media creation tool connect a drive like this to your primary rig or a laptop or some other device that can connect to the internet and then have the creation tool install all the necessary files for windows installation onto a drive like this then connect the drive to a usb port from the system to which you'll want to install windows i got that backwards there we go then power on the system and boot into the usb drive you just connected you should end up at a screen like this from here you'll want to click next and install we can skip the product key for now then select the version of windows you want this will depend on the key you plan to buy mine's usually windows 10 pro except the license terms and then select custom install this way we know exactly where we're installing windows so you can see the only drive connected is drive zero and we have roughly one terabyte of unallocated space this makes sense because the drive is brand new so we'll make sure this is selected and then we'll click next and then windows will create a bootable volume of roughly this size for windows and that's about it once this finishes you'll run through the typical windows setup prompts and you should end up on your desktop it's literally that simple and there we go so to kick things off cinebench multi-core score 11563 that's up by a few percentage points not spectacularly different uh but it is something it's something that he wasn't getting before so a small improvement there now let's check superposition and okay well not much of a difference here pretty much the same score we did update his driver though so at least he's good there so this person's setup really didn't benefit all that much from the fresh windows install it is still worth noting that you could run into more serious complications down the line if this person hasn't already experienced the blue screen of death or two i'm sure it would have come up at some point on this old drive it's just not recommended you did see a two to three percent bump in cp performance that could of course affect frame rates and games and the like but in terms of overall stability i think that you want to play it safe no matter what and i've i can say from experience when i've been lazy and just wanted to transfer drives from intel systems to amd systems and and vice versa it's just not worth it just start fresh transfer important files and you'll be good to go the last thing to take care of then are the fan orientations i spoke to the owner he's okay with us swapping these back around to the more conventional layout and cable management it's not too bad here but i do want to straighten things up a bit might as well since it's here we'll start with this rear fan it's not going to be pretty straightforward all we need to do is just flip each of these around i need to remove the four screws that hold each of these in in order to do that easy does it and with the remaining case fans tackled we can focus on this cpu tower we've got a fan that has a bunch of cables wrapped around i don't think this looks very good so we're gonna try to stuff the extra cabling here behind the motherboard tray just to get rid of it let's see we can rotate the fan like so keep it positioned there and then we'll use these little uh retention clips to lock the fan in place these can be kind of annoying now we can fix cabling and both the front and rear need a bit of that and would you look at that you know i'd say she cleans up quite nicely just a few cable ties or zip ties and uh yeah bit of finesse stuff some extra cables right in front of this power supply that we don't need and uh looking very clean back here let's see from the front um yeah i mean it's clean we've got a few questionable just i don't know places that cables more or less have to be routed and tuck this speaker down in here and uh yeah i think the last thing we need to do is clean this one up a bit so all right looking much better now well that was interesting unexpected series of events sure i didn't expect the system to work right out of the gate when we brought it in and i'm still stumped by that so is the owner i'm sure i'm trying to think of what could have caused this what maybe could have been fixed during transport from when i picked it up to when i brought it here and plugged it in for the first time it's possible we might have had a loose ddr4 module that could certainly cause the no post issue that the viewer was describing and we've shown what that looks like in a previous fix or vlog video i highly doubt this issue was caused by mis-wiring of some sort i don't see how that would fix itself in transport and it's not like i drive like a lunatic so things aren't being knocked around too much and i have actually a pretty solid place to put these when i bring them back to the house and then bring them back to the owners after the fact i kind of lay them uh slanted like at a 45 degree angle in the front of my 911 and it sits very sturdy there it doesn't rock around or anything like that that's the worst thing for a build especially if you have an optical drive or a hard drive in your system having those platters or that laser get knocked around on those arms it's just not good so i always try to make sure that they are secured when i'm driving them to and from our meetup points uh but with that i mean the build looks a lot cleaner now we fixed the fan orientation issue and we did mitigate potential disaster down the line by reinstalling windows on a fresh one terabyte ssd and yeah potentially avoiding blue screens of death loss and performance we saw a bit of that here it's just safe all around to reinstall windows or reformat your boot drive when moving from Intel to AMD or AMD to Intel now you might be asking well greg what if i have an older AMD system like an AMD fx-8320e platform and i upgrade to Ryzen 5 or horizon 7. you should be in a better boat i still recommend that you completely start fresh just in case but that's certainly a better situation to be in than if you were going from any intel generation to any AMD generation the two just they're mutually exclusive and should be treated as such there are too many potential driver issues you could run into software conflicts uh even registry issues things that could cause frequent blue screens of death down the line that uh yeah i always advise starting fresh so if you guys enjoyed this one be sure to let me know by giving this one a thumbs up i would appreciate that i unfortunately can't point to the solution of the no post issue although again i think ddr4 probably that's probably it i don't know what else it could be sorry i got dust in my nose probably from outside but uh i i can't think of any other possible reason why the system wouldn't post at his house and would post in my office just that's just bizarre but uh nonetheless the system is working now has a nice little upgrade and we mitigated potential catastrophes by completely reinstalling windows on a fresh new drive and i've got his old drive i'm going to give back to him so if he wants to reinstall that and save some files transfer those to the new operating system he can by the way if you live in and around the Orlando Florida area maybe you're willing to drive to Orlando to have me look at your system and attempt to fix it for free you can do so by sending an email to our help address it's help salazarstudios.org that's a new email we're going to use for all communications from viewers to our business going forward so if you want to enter for a PCDC cleaning or a fixer flop episode and then we're actually expanding to a few other playlists as well that email is the one you'll use that's help@salazarstudios.org if you're not local we're gonna ignore the email we just we can't afford to deal with the liabilities associated with shipping and well the unreliabilities associated with shipping now if you are not subscribed yet watching this far into the video i'm deeply confused by your methodology i'll give you a few seconds to click the subscribe button take care of it i appreciate that and leave a comment down below letting me know what you'd like to see next my name is greg thanks for

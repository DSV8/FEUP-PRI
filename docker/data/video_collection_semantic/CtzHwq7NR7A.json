    "transcript": "this cpu cost me less than 26 us dollars new and today i'm gonna try to do some gaming on it oh just there's the little cat but amazingly for that price you even get the terrible little stock intel cooler which if there's one cpu that this may actually be reasonable to use on it's gonna be a 25 celeron it's so thin now the cpu in question that cost less than a medium quality tummy tickles these days is the intel celeron g5900 which fits in the lga 1200 socket which means it's a relatively modern cpu now it may just have two cores no hyper threading and a base frequency of 3.4 gigahertz specs which wouldn't have been particularly exciting back in 2007 but for 26 dollars even if it came with trace amounts of anthrax in the box i wouldn't have been particularly bothered i mean it's even got an igpu in it it's not a very good one but it's there which means we should probably try gaming on this thing so let's drop it in a motherboard and see what happens now that we have the little dollar menu cpu in here we need to start thinking about the ram configuration we're going to use and because i'm in a bit of a cruel mood today we're going to start out with a single 4 gig stick of ddr4 which should be interesting considering that we're not going to start out using a graphics card we're just going to game using the igpu in this g5900 so let's drop the single four gig stick of ram in here and fulfill every pre-built manufacturer's sick power fantasy wow gta 5 clearly knows what's up starting us off at 800 by 600 with everything on low so it doesn't really expect much from the little baby celeron but we should have some faith in it so i'm gonna start off just straight up with 1080p now usually with systems like this when i start off at 1080p it doesn't go very well but maybe the little celeron will prove us wrong yay we finally loaded in it's been what felt like several generations has passed but we're in and uh sitting at about 14 frames per second i don't think it's quite proved us wrong it's so much tearing but it's doing that thing again that i really like about entry-level celerons where you can't tell if the cpu or the igpu is the bottleneck but in this situation with this ram configuration i'm leaning towards the eye gpu being the issue whoa it is crazy how much better 19 frames per second feels when you're coming from 11 frames per second like this this feels remarkably playable now like i'm actually pretty pretty happy with this 19 frames per second at 720p and at 720p the cpu has become the bottleneck here because apparently 20 frames per second is just too much for the little dual core celeron uh which is interesting because later in the video i am going to drop a beefy graphics card in here and we will we'll see what happens yeah that's not very promising although again we are just working with four gigs of ram here between the cpu and the igp so that's four gigs total system memory also we can see that stock intel cooler is clearly in its element easily able to cool the 12 watts of power but before we move on to a different game let's just try it at 800 by 600 which is the resolution the gta 5 recommended for this system so it seems as though the little celeron tops out at around 24ish frames per second even with quite a light load like gta 5 at 800 by 600. but before we try a less stupid ram configuration in the system let's try some other games now when it comes to the standard foray of games that i ran on this channel things didn't go very well unsurprisingly battlefield 5 just flat out refused to launch cyberpunk did a good job pretending to try and launch but would just crash every time although there was one surprisingly aaa game that did launch oh shadow of the tomb raider launched for some reason let's see if we can get a benchmark running now this is why i respect shadow of the tomb raider even if you try running it on something like an ophthalmoscope it'll still find a way to run even even if it runs like this at 10 frames per second it really it really tries its best you know and despite the game's lack of confidence well that's very promising i also got rainbow six siege running a game at which i'm very skilled well despite me being very bad at rainbow six siege apparently at 720p low settings it's closer to running than gta 5 was so that's pretty impressive i guess nice it feels so smooth now that we've got eight gigs of ram in single channel now again we can kind of tell that even with the increase in ram capacity we're still not necessarily going to be able to get above that 20 frame per second threshold because the celeron is still very much struggling to keep up with its own eye gpu i'm i'm excited to see what's going to happen when we drop a big boy graphics card in the system either way though doubling the amount of single channel ram available to the little celeron has made a shocking difference in performance but what happens when we go dual channel so now that we've fixed one of the biggest blows to the crotch of the celeron's performance let's see how it holds up with no excuses well with the dual channel ram i'm noticing a couple of big changes the first one is that we're actually hovering around that 20 frame per second mark now occasionally going over it like there and despite that our cpu utilization isn't pegged at a hundred percent and looking at the benchmarks you can see the celeron is really starting to stretch its legs it seems like we're finally starting to unlock the real speed demon in the celeron but what happens if we give it even more ram oh that's not really done much big surprise there apparently if you throw 64 gigs of ram at a celeron g5900 it's not going to know what to do with it even if it has 32 gigs of ram available just for the igpu ok well i guess now we need to throw a graphics card at it and i know just which one wow okay it's doing about twice as well as i was expecting it to do it it's not a very smooth experience but it's oh yeah it's quite stuttery isn't it and things just kept going worse ooh that is not a good sign the moment that gta 5's environments start disintegrating like that you know things are not going well so with 64 gigs of ram and an rtx 3080 ti in here we may be getting about double the performance i was expecting from the little celeron but we're also only getting about half of the game environment which i don't know i think that's a pretty good compromise we do have very low combined system power draw out of the 3080 ti and the little celerons so that's nice you know if you if you live in a country where power it's just crashed and after that crash i pretty much couldn't get anything else to run without also crashing after just a couple minutes so what did we learn in today's video well you can buy all of the ram in the world and still not be able to outrun your problems and celerons and rtx 3080tis really do not like each other which brings me to the end of the video thank you for watching if you enjoyed it consider watching another one a suggestion will pop up in a second and until the next video bye",

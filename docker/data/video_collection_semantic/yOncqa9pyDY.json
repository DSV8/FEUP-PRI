    "transcript": "in today's video we're comparing the two giants of dodgy PC electronics Aliexpress versus wish calm or the scam asaurus rex vs the hustler after [Music] buying fake graphics cards on wish calm is kind of all the rage on YouTube at the moment but there used to be a time when Aliexpress was the preferred go-to place for youtubers to get scammed so what I decided to do in today's video is compare the shopping experience between buying a graphics card on wish calm and buying a graphics card on Aliexpress now considering the fact that I already had the hilariously terrible gtx 1050 TI from wish i decided to buy a gtx 1050 TI from a reseller on Aliexpress and see how the two graphics cards compare now when going on to wish calm and looking for pc components it's a pretty terrible selection it's kind of like choosing which urinal to use in a public toilet it's just ah but when you go onto Aliexpress the selection actually looks a lot better there are a bunch of listings for GT x 1050 TI's which look kind of like the real thing and the pricing is also more realistic they're kind of priced at a point which makes sense for a 1050 Ti however that does mean that if they're fake you're kind of losing a lot more money than on wish calm but it means that there's more of a chance for them to actually be real however what I decided to do is not just buy what is obviously a real 1050 TI for like a reasonable amount of of Aliexpress because that wouldn't be a fair comparison going while this $50 1050 Ti from wish is fake but this 150 dollar obviously recognizable 1050 Ti from Aliexpress is real therefore wishes worse like that's that doesn't seem fair so what I decided to do was buy a card that I didn't actually recognize that the model of editing dont here you can tell because I don't have a beard anymore looks so terrible but anyway the reason that I'm interrupting myself here is because I am very stupid like I am one of the most stupid people ever now through the entire process of making this video so ie buying the graphics card getting it unboxing it doing all the things that I do to it over the course of this video I just assumed that I was right in thinking that this was a dodgy Asus card that wasn't like a standard model that they had so when I actually edited the video I get to this point and I want to go find a picture on Asus website to substantiate the fact that it is in fact not in their normal catalogue well as you can see from this picture it is it is it is a 1050 Ti so what we're gonna do from here on out is we're just gonna laughs with a deep knowledge we're essentially gonna catch me every single time that I bring up about how I think that this is a dodgy graphics card and explain why again I'm really sorry for this confusion I'm so dumb but yeah with that let's get back to the video so now that we've selected our contenders from the competing marketplaces I'm going to compare them on a couple of metrics now the first one is going to be price and here well wish wins hands down the 1050 Ti from wish was about 48 dollars whereas the Aliexpress card was about 128 dollars which is significantly more expensive and it's kind of in line with what a 1050 Ti costs but it's really not a good deal and you shouldn't be buying one at this point in time and then the second metric that I'm gonna compare is the quality of the packaging number three is gonna be the build quality of the various cards and then we're gonna see whether or not they're actually real now with this one the whish 1050 Ti obviously lost already but the jury is still out on the Aliexpress card so with that let's get into the unboxing straight off the bat Aliexpress is looking fairly fairly terrible or at least the seller on Aliexpress is looking very fairly terrible so let's let's get the sky open here we go and this looks like a shoe box that you bury a dead burden to be honest and it's already not comparing very well and we just get these out of the way to the wish ten ten fifty TI box but let's open it up maybe there is another box in there which I'm not convinced that there is there we go yeah that's it there isn't another layer of packaging it comes with with this guy which I would not recommend anybody ever use under any circumstances a single molex to 6-pin cable and then there's a lot of bubble okay there we go and here is the graphics card okay here we go that's that's quite an interesting looking cooler there's a bit of a bit of peach fluff fluff over there on the graphics card it's not been cleaned very well but this is supposedly a 1050 Ti look at that we've even got a sticker here that says that it is I mean it's an Asus card it's got the correct IO or it's got I oh that makes sense at least now when looking closer at the actual design of this graphics card it's pretty dodgy it's not wish gtx 1050 TI dodgy but it's still fairly suspect now the reason that it's suspect is because of the shroud that it has here this shroud looks kind of similar to an Asus GTX 960 I don't know of a 1050 Ti that has this actual shroud design however when you look at the actual top of the card over here you'll see that it's got these gaps for like I guess heat pipes and stuff and there's nothing populated there after just a brief hands-on with the two cars the Aliexpress card is definitely the better made of the two it's not saying a huge amount considering the fact that this wish card is it's pretty rubbish but yeah with that out of the way let's plug this bad boy in and see whether or not this is a real 1050 Ti [Music] okay now I've plugged it into the actual test bed here and I have to say after handling it for a little bit I think that this is a real 1050 TI now I know that this is quite a risky statement to make but yeah I'm gonna hedge my bets let me know what you think in the comment section below if you think this is a real tense 50 TI or whether or not it's some fake imposter and while you're down there like this video and subscribe to the channel if you haven't already now the first thing that we're gonna do is we're gonna use the PC jump starter to power up the PC and see whether or not it actually works oh it looks it's actually it's it's powering up there's a display signal which makes a lot more sense than the one that came out of out of this bad boy over here before we fixed it the only problem is I think I may have AMD drivers on this system so I may have to delete those okay a blue screen of death almost immediately now all it tries to boot up here a second time I just want to say that if this graphics card is real it is devastating for this competition because this was one of the more dodgy looking 1050 TI's I could find on Aliexpress and on wish you kind of can't buy one than isn't dodge ok well the graphics card driver installed on the Aliexpress card which is already a lot better than how the the whish graphics card performed honestly the wish card performed a little bit like it was infected with the plague and now it's time that we peek under the dress of this graphics card and confirm whether or not this is a real 1050 Ti [Music] oh oh yes so let's set aside the GPU first and look at what's happening in here this is a very interesting heatsink design because it's not actually connected to the shroud at all which is very weird it kind of seems like this shroud belongs to a different graphics card this GPU is in fact GP 107 400 a 1 and a quick Google search does actually confirm that this is in fact a gtx 1050 t9 now in conclusion which marketplace wins this clearly pointless shootout now because of how kind of weird the points worked for this competition they're actually tied which doesn't really make sense because the wish graphics card is clearly fake and the Aliexpress card is clearly real so the Aliexpress card makes more sense if you want to buy a component that's real and that actually leads me to a point where I can quite easily summarize the difference between wish and Aliexpress for buying PC components now when buying PC components on wish calm it there aren't really options that look like they're real you're almost definitely going to be scammed and if the components do work they're gonna be really overpriced for what they are whereas with Aliexpress there are a lot more genuine options on that website and it's more obvious which are fake in which are real and with that thank you very much for watching if you like this video do like and subscribe to this channel for more videos like this one follow me on Twitch where I stream every Saturday follow me on Twitter and Instagram and there's a discord server and all those good things and until the next video bye [Music]

During that time the 7 Pro has seen plenty of updates that improved everything from battery life to camera performance and more.

    "transcript": "so this is the oneplus 7 Pro and I'm finally getting around to this review because it's been a crazy couple of months for us here at the studio now I've been using this device for the past 70 days and it is an interesting smart phone in 2019 especially for the price and how it competes to the competition right now because a lot of the premium flagship phones are going on sale I've got to admit I wasn't really impressed with the camera performance and some other things with this device but I've gotta hand it to oneplus for rolling out some major software updates over the course of my testing period that addressed a lot of the issues but with that being said I still have some major annoyances with the 7 Pro so sit back grab a cup of coffee or a fruit yeah I just said of food it could be an apple a banana or Kiwi I actually like Kiwi to be honest too so if you're in the same boat as I am virtual high five anyways guys let's let's get into this but first a quick message from our sponsor the razor blade Pro 17 pushing performance to the edge the edge where the snakes live it is now smaller and lighter than previous generations and cooler under heavy workloads thanks to additional fans and vapor chamber cooling the display is also factory calibrated for beautiful colors and impressively thin bezels to please your eyeballs for work and play with high performance max Q GPUs also let's not forget the wonderful connectivity options to future-proof this notebook the Razer Blade pro 17 check it out below alright so let's kick things off with the price it starts at 670 u.s. dollars or 900 canadian which is not cheap people oneplus was once known for selling amazing flagship killer phones for less than $400 it's not the case anymore they're slowly creeping into the premium phone category but they still managed to undercut the big players in the market right now actually that statement would be a lot more appropriate a couple months ago when this phone was launched because right now you can pick up flagship phones like the galaxy is 10 for around the same price as a 7 pro and in some regions you could end up getting a carry exclusive deal and end up picking up that phone for around $500 now the galaxy stem was one of my favorite Android smartphones of the year and if you're interested in a full review you can check it out right over there we also have forms like the pixel 3a that just shook the smartphone industry with its incredible camera performance at $400 so why would someone consider the 7 Pro over the competition well let me start with my favorite feature of this device the 90 Hertz fluid AMOLED display seriously I cannot emphasize how amazing this screen is it's so fluid and fast and when you pair it with amazing software this is the phone to beat in 2019 in the display Department of course scrolling through Twitter Instagram Gmail is just flawless and responsive that being said I should mention that at 6.67 inches this is a big and I mean a really big phone if you're used to phones like the iPhone 10 Galaxy S9 pixel 3 or just smaller phones in general the oneplus 7 pro is noticeably in fact a lot bigger than those devices because at times I've had trouble reaching the top spots when I'm holding the phone in one hand so I'd have to sort of glide the phone hoping that it won't slip or fall and then hit those spots and as you can see like visually this phone is just it's way too big guys and it's just not practical for people with smaller hands the bigger display certainly comes in clutch for watching Netflix shows and movies since they take good advantage of the screen real estate that's another positive thing that I can think of the screen but the curved edges on the side they're just really aggressive compared to the galaxy s 10 which I still had issues with in terms of palm detection it's about the same with the 7 pro and when watching videos it gets super distracting in well-lit environments now some people did report ghosts touching issues on the 7 pearls display I certainly haven't experienced any of that but it looks like oneplus did roll out a soft update addressing that so that's nice the model that I have over here comes in this nebula blue finish and it looks gorgeous the frosted texture is less slippery than the glass back on the s10 you'll have to pay an extra $30 to get this color over the base model but get this you get two extra gigs of ram and double the storage that's a steal in my opinion plus if you want you can spec this out with 12 gigabytes of RAM that is if you really want to brag about it now there are other color options including almond and mirror gray but keep in mind that those variants can't be SPECT up to 12 gigabytes of RAM the design has been refined slightly from the 60 so you get stereo speakers where the earpiece acts as the left channel and bottom facing the right channel and they sound great there's a noticeable difference compared to the mono speaker on the 60 and guys I should mention that the speakers are really loud but they don't compromise on the audio fidelity because it sounds clear doesn't distort whatsoever I haven't missed a notification or an alarm bell so that's awesome but I also want to quickly talk about call quality because it was excellent on 7 Pro the person on the other end didn't have any issues hearing me and vice-versa so that's nice the other cool feature about the 7 Pro is the pop-up camera you see at first I was a bit skeptical about the mechanism and the durability of this implementation because I'm the type of person who's really not into selfies except when I'm on a video conference call it works when I needed to and if I automatically you know drop the device when it's in freefall the gyroscopes in the accelerometer they retract the camera module I get a little notification here too which is great plus I like it hidden in the first place because that way you get a complete bezel list and nostos design I mean who doesn't like that however I will mention that the rubber grommets around the camera really didn't do that much to prevent debris from entering as you can see it's pretty evident so I'd recommend cleaning it often oh and the alerts letter is still here good job oneplus I still can't believe how other smartphone manufacturers haven't adopted this because I've taken advantage of this numerous times when I'm at meetings it's in the little details that makes oneplus stand out from the rest the in display fingerprint scanner is ridiculously fast I've had zero issues with it so far I never even bothered setting up face on locks solely because of how fast and reliable it is I simply placed my thumb and it unlocks right away it doesn't even take a second to think about it and if I were to compare this to the Galaxy S 10 there's just no competition period now for those of you wondering if you caught my one plus 60 review I mentioned how I had some issues with Google pay on that device well I'm happy to report I haven't experienced any of that or encountered that on the 7 Pro so that's good now all of that being said this phone doesn't scream rainbows and butterflies because it does lack some key features that enthusiasts might look into especially for the price for instance you don't get wireless charging no expandable storage no headphone jack nor it doesn't even come with an official IP water-resistant rating but hear me out for a second because I necessarily don't value those features for my use case scenario let's start with wireless charging sure it would have been really nice to have but warp charge 30 is a good trade-off because it tops up the battery to 60% in less than 30 minutes now of course it's not as good as opposed super walk charge but it is what it is then there's expandable storage I personally don't need more than 128 gigabytes as you can see by my usage the lack of a headphone jack I'm honestly over it I have embraced wireless audio because of the convenience I use the bullets to wireless from one plus and it's been a solid pair so far although I'm disappointed that oneplus didn't include a type c2 3.5 millimeter adapter in the box especially since you're paying close to $700 for this thing you see if you're in the same boat as I am there's no reason to complain about the lack of those features but if you absolutely need them you should probably look elsewhere moving on to the software experience I really don't have much to say other than the fact that oxygen OS is very efficient customizable and intuitive to use believe it or not this is the first time that have not installed a custom launcher or an icon pack on this device because I actually like the way how it looks out of the box of course I had to throw in my own touch to make it somewhat unique but something else that I do want to bring up is that oneplus has invested a lot of time into refining the Android experience because over the course of my testing period I received three to four major software updates that not only improved the cam performance which I'll get to shortly but it also helped improved or fix a lot of the bugs with this device and that is just awesome I mean if there's one company that I can think of aside from Google that values software it's one plus now battery life on the 7 Pro is good but not 60 good you see on a heavy use case scenario when I have Bluetooth GPS and I'm constantly using my phone throughout the day when I'm traveling I was able to push it to around you know 6 hours of screen on time but on a lighter day I could extend it to a day-and-a-half with around seven hours of screen on time but this all depends on your use case scenario I can certainly say it's not as good as a 60 and that's obviously because of the 90 Hertz quad HD display it's a lot of pixels to drive especially at that refresh rate now you could go and switch your refresh rate to 60 Hertz but that completely misses the point you're completely you know I mean why would you go for this phone in the first place if you're setting it to 60 Hertz it just doesn't make any sense and finally let's wrap things up with the camera performance the 7 pro has three sensors an ultra-wide a standard lens for portraits and a telephoto lens for that extra reach you see at first I wasn't really impressed with the low-light performance as you can see it decided to apply a Vaseline filter on Dimitri's face it's really hilarious guys and there's little to no detail it also lacked a bit of saturation in contrast even daylight scenarios with other samples the pop-up front-facing camera takes decent pictures but it lacks detail and I'm not really into that it's certainly not as close as what you can get on the pixel the ultra wide sensor is a welcoming addition you can capture beautiful landscapes with this thing but after receiving a major software update recently it's a different story guys there's a good balance of saturation and contrast the colors coming out of the sensor look really good low-light performance is also improved and I didn't notice the software playing that weird lastly in effect from before so that's awesome the only thing that I'd say is that the pictures still lack a bit of detail at least when you compare it to the pixel 3 but I'm going to let you guys be the judge here what do you guys think about these samples let me know in the comments down below so this is the video test on the oneplus 7 Pro and as you can see it looks really good I'm actually really impressed with the image quality and the dynamic range coming out of this phone the one thing to keep note of is that you can only shoot 4k at 60 frames per second with image stabilization with 30fps you don't get it but it's not as good as the s10 I mean it's you can still see a little bit of jitteriness as I'm walking the other thing to also keep note of is that you cannot use the wide-angle lens to shoot video because right now it's only using the standard lens for that and I can zoom in quickly if I want to get some shots but that's about it this is the front-facing camera test as you can see the image stabilization is not the best but it does a pretty good job with dynamic range also it's not as wide enough wide enough as I'd like it to be and the microphone quality is also surprisingly better compared to the pixel 3 which I really like but now let me know what you guys think about the video test on the oneplus 7 pro in the comments all right so final thoughts on the oneplus 7 pro at $670 for the base model I'm still having trouble recommending this over the galaxy s10 and the pixel 3a because I've used those smartphones and they're good at a lot of things for instance the galaxy is 10 beautiful hardware it's packed with features it's got good camera performance I'll be the video quality is top-notch software is passable provided you actually spend the time setting it up and they're actually behind oneplus when it comes to software updates now the pixel 3a man I've recommended that phone to a lot of my friends in fact they keep sending me pictures or sample photos from their phone thanking me for recommending that phone just because of its incredible camera performance especially since it only costs $400 I think the best features are the 7 Pro are the 90 Hertz AMOLED display it's just spoiled me to be honest but it's amazing and the in display fingerprint scanner is just so fast and responsive I've got to get bonus points to oneplus for improving the camp performance and on top of that you know they value software experience above all of them so the 7 Pro does not disappoint in that regard but I also want to quickly talk about the oneplus 7 because it really is ought to see oneplus just announced the 7 Pro in the North American market and not the 7 I'm aware that is available in other regions but not having that phone in the North American market makes it a little bit confusing because you had the oneplus 7 Pro but what makes it pro compared to the non Pro varium which should be the 7 but it's not it's the sixty let me know what you guys think about the oneplus 7 Pro if you are an existing owner I would love to know your thoughts about your experience as well in the comments I mean bird with Harbor connects thank you so much for watching make sure to check out some relevant content over here subscribe to our boot sequence Channel and I'll see you guys in the next one",

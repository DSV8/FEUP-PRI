    "transcript": "- The honest truth is that today's video didn't work out. So Jake and I knocked off early and we're gonna set up my family room. We've got three main goals today. Number one is to un-this-ify the place. Number two is to get the brand new Sony X95K TV set up right there. And number three is to deal with the sound setup, which is gonna be either really simple or a royal pain in the butt. - Unlike the segue to our sponsor. - Yeah, not painful at all. - SignalRGB. Ditch the hassle of using multiple RGB applications. With SignalRGB, you can control and sync your favorite RGB devices all from one free app. Download SignalRGB today at the link down below. (upbeat music) - The TV is obviously the most exciting part. - Okay wait, hold on. We gotta start moving stuff out! - Yes, we do. - There's crap in the way. - Okay. If we unsort this stuff out, my son's gonna have a hissy fit. - So we're just gonna go dump it on his bed, right? - (laughs) No, I wouldn't recommend it. I'm not even gonna attempt to organize Yvonne's stuff. No, no, you're good. - Oh, you're just gonna- - Yeah, we're gonna. (Linus whooping) - Wow, there's even more Lego. - Cleaning! No, don't shoot this way. You're killing the rapid cleaning illusion. - What even is all this crap? - My aunt, bless her heart, brings a lot of crap into our house. - [Jake] So tell her to stop! - This is the bin of things for her to take away, please. I was not sure that we were gonna be able to get away with putting an OLED in this room because even one generation ago, they were not really optimal for rooms with a lot of natural light like this one. But that all changed, (grunts) with the release of Samsung's QD-OLED, quantum dot OLED technology. \"But Linus,\" you might say, \"that's a Sony, not a Samsung.\" That's because this Sony display uses the same panel as Samsung's S95B, a QD-OLED panel, but with Android TV built-in instead of Samsung's awful Tizen OS, and with superior image processing. (squeals) Oh, not to mention Dolby Vision. - I like how this isn't paper thin, hey? - Yeah. - [Jake] Oh man, some of those LG TVs. I don't even want to pick it up. - Speaking of LG, it should be noted that in response to the QD-OLED threat, LG actually released a newer, updated version of their W-OLED technology that gets pretty much just as bright. But, after testing them side by side by side, we determined that this was the best of the current generation TVs. Which isn't to say that it doesn't have any downsides. - [Jake] For one thing it's really expensive. - [Linus] Like, 33% more expensive. - And for another, it's only available on a really limited amount of sizes. I think you can only get 55, 65, and 75? - I don't even know if it goes to 75. But it works out great for me because, (Linus mimicking fanfare) this opening right here is actually modified from the original cabinet, which is so deep because it was designed for a CRT TV and then all of your CDs and stuff. So we we ripped those side ones out and it happens to be exactly perfect for a 65 inch TV. It's like it was meant to be. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I need a screwdriver. - (claps) I'm so glad you brought that up. Let me show you my perfectly organized garage. Let's go! - [Jake] Oh boy. - The tour begins with my wonderful paint booth. - Oh? Oh you're doing the, are you doing this yourself? - Yeah, why not? - Really? Can I touch it, is it dry? - Yeah, yeah, yeah that's dry. - Have you sanded it yet? Kind of feels like crap right now. - I'm using the oil, but I'm finishing with a semi-gloss Varathane. - That's fine. - Yeah, so. - But you gotta sand it a lot more. - They look really nice, though. This one has more coats than that one. I ran out of oil. At any rate, the point is, what do you think of my paint booth? - [Jake] This is not bad though. - This only took me three hours. But this is my gloriously organized one shelf. The contractors- - I was gonna say, you said garage. This is one shelf. - Well... The contractors are using the rest of the space in here. Look, ask me for anything and I will immediately summon it. - Cat 6A Keystone Jacks. - Yes. (Linus tutting) (plastic rustling) - Okay. (Linus cackling) Painter's tape. - Painter's tape. Yes! - Battery charger for the impact driver. - Battery charger for the impact driver? Oh crap. (fingers snapping) Nope, that's over here. (Jake laughing) Hold on, no, no, no, no! I've got it. It's right here! - [Jake] Is it plugged in? - Well, no. - [Jake] Aw. - But come on! Come on, I've got it! (Jake laughing) Wait, you're not gonna test me anymore? I'm ready! - This is a really weird mount. I have never seen one quite like this before. - Oh, interesting. So they hit every VESA pattern by having it adjustable - Rather than just attaching little bars to the TV and putting it onto the thing. You attach the thing to the TV- - And then hang the whole thing on the thing. - Okay, I can already tell that this mount is stupid. - Uh-oh. - [Jake] 'Cause here's the problem. It tells you to put it in the center, right? - [Linus] Yeah. - [Jake] This bar should be the equal length from the middle, right? - [Linus] Yeah? - But the nice thing about the ones where you put the bar on the TV, the two little hangers? - Yeah. - Is you just move the TV if it's off. This, you have to take the TV off the wall, screw with these things. - [Linus] There's no way. - [Jake] That's how you, look! Center, and then tighten. - [Linus] There's no way. - [Jake] Am I stupid? - I mean, well. (paper smacking) (Linus laughing) - [Jake] The height of this is gonna be very important. - Oh, seriously? - I mean, we can adjust this a little bit. We can go a little bit back and forth. I mean, you're not gonna want the mount to hang off the bottom. Fortunately, the Sony TV has this cool pattern on the back. Makes it really easy to center. - Oh, that worked out great for everyone involved. - Yeah. - [Linus] We basically have to nail the height, or it is not going to sit in front of this noise here. - Yeah, I understand that. With that in mind, I have an idea. Do you know what the total height of the TV is? I just wanna get this part properly. - No I don't. - So that this gap is correct. - I can find the total height of the TV. 83 1/2 is there. - Wow, it's gonna be... - I knows! (Jake laughing nervously) Narrow margins here. So we just need this little mark I made. Here it is. To the bottom of that. So from the bottom of the TV to this hole, needs to be- - [Jake] 21, plus whatever that is. - [Linus] 20 1/2. There. That is 2 centimeters above the mark where we want the bezel of the TV to sit. This is 18 1/2 from the top of this. Plus 2, is 20 1/2. I then take my caveman level and I go a little something like that. (power drill buzzing) - [Jake] Oh my God, the noise. - Oh yeah. Oh yeah! That's not going anywhere, boys. I do wish there was more vertical adjustment after the fact. - [Jake] Is it level? It really doesn't look level. - It says it's level. - [Jake] 'Kay, is the cabinet level though? - Well, that I don't know. (Jake laughing) No. - [Jake] (laughs) Oh, come on! (beep) Come on, really? Hold on. - It's not even close, Jake. - [Jake] All right, let's put the TV on the wall and see if our maths work. - Screw it. Can you even fit back there? Oh. Now that's using your head! (Jake grunting) (TV mount clicking) - [Linus And Jake] Oh! - [Jake] Wait, it did do. Did it do? - Yeah, it did do. It should be noted that SANUS only rates this for 55 inch TVs. - It's well within the weight limit - But it's well within, that's what I was gonna say. I was gonna say it. I was hosting the video. - You're too slow. - Okay, am I... (TV mount squeaking) - Okay, let's not do that. - You good? - Okay well, actually close, but the height. (laughs) (Linus sighing) The height! How did you screw that up, man? It's so close. - Come on. Oh no. (power drill buzzing) - Oh my God. - That will go there. (power drill buzzing) - Ow! - Sorry, how's your forearm? - Ouchie. (TV mount clicking) Hold on. Okay, it's in. - [Linus] Okay. (Jake laughing) - [Jake] Can we just leave it like- - No! (Jake laughing) No. - [Jake] Okay, down on the left. Way too much. That's pretty good right there. - No, that's not... - [Jake] No, no, back up, back up. I would just leave it there if we can. - It's actually not bad. - Now we just have to plug everything in. - Yeah. - Let's just put the Xbox down there. - There's so many options. I actually kind of love this setup because we had a mesh thing put in here so we can have cooling in here if we really want to. - [Jake] I thought we were putting a subwoofer in there? - [Linus] I don't actually think this sub is gonna fit in there. - [Jake] Oh actually it might. - [Linus] I'm gonna take my best shot at it though. - I'm gonna say it's not gonna sound great. - Yeah. Oh, you know what? That actually kind of might work - [Jake] Here. (cables scattering) - What the, oh. This is about to get really fun now. Okay, you ready boys? - [Jake] No. - [Linus] Wait 'til I pull this hide and seek hiding spot on my kids. They will literally never find me. - [Jake] Okay, try to come out now. (Linus knocking) - Thank you, very funny. There is so much space to work back here. Honestly, it's kind of amazing. What we're doing right now, oops. Is I'm plugging the eARC HDMI port into this little A9 box from Sony. This is the wireless/processing box for their super cool A9-HT speaker set. It's pretty expensive, but compared to a single sound bar, it's a actually kind of good solution. Obviously it's not gonna sound as good as the home theater set up downstairs, but the positioning of the speakers is super flexible and they look really nice, so the wife approval factor is very high. These got the crap kicked out of them when we were working on that video for Sony. 'Cause Jake forgot to take them out of our leaning tower of- - [Jake] Forgot? I didn't make the tower. (Linus laughing) Who made the tower? - Oh no! (sound system crashing) Anyway, one of the coolest things about these is that you can kind of put them wherever you want. Then they measure the room and adjust. Now that's a feature that's available on lots of audio products. Everything from sound bars to actual full home theater setups. But because these are four discrete speakers, you're going to get better directionality out of them than you can from a single source sitting right under your TV. - And we did try them. Even though it was sponsored, they do actually sound pretty good and the effect is very good. - We won't say things, even in a sponsored video, that we don't actually think. - Yeah, so are you- - I mean, I'd like to have it here, but I have no idea where on earth I'd plug that in. - The backgrounds I've positioned here? - [Linus] I'm just gonna put it here and then I'll just tuck the, oh my God there's a hole already. - Beautiful. - You got that? - [Jake] Is there hole on the other side, no. (laughs) Use your TV as a center speaker. Next, yes. - They have these drivers directly behind the panel. And when you use a compatible surround setup, you can actually use the TV speakers themselves, built in here, as your center channel. So we got our right. We got our left. - [Jake] The right's not- - We got our center. We got our rear, and we got our other, hmm? - The right's not powered yet. - I'm working on it. - You gotta drill the hole. - I'm working on it! Geez, I'm trying to tell the people about the center speaker. (power drill buzzing) Ow! Andy, I have an idea. If I go at an angle like this, I can go. (laughs) I can go through the wall here and then the bottom of this empty space, this cavity here, and meet up with my hole I made here that goes through the wall here. (power drill buzzing) - [Andy] Oh my God. - [Linus] Ow! - [Andy] Are you using that up there? - [Linus] Don't worry about it. You can see it? - [Andy] Oh it's here! - [Linus] Did I get it? - [Andy] Yeah! - Minor problem. Here's a couch and there's a speaker. (laughs) - I'm not sure what Yvonne has planned for these, but I'm fairly certain that this isn't it. Oh! - [Jake] Oh, beautiful. - Now we just need some decor. This is an Yvonne initiative. She's been buying every Lego plant thing that they release. (Linus and Jake laughing) And she's planning to use them in place of actual plants in our house. I actually think it looks kind of amazing though. My grandmother gave me this egg. What she ever expected me to do with it, I'll never know. But now it's here. (ceramic clanking) (Jake laughing) My random sword from the Richmond Night Market. I need decor items. Why do I suck at this so much? Ah, fake plants. Yes! Success! Oh God. That has to have been done by one of the kids. That's not going up. How's that one look? - [Jake] Mediocre at best. - Size wise, does this kind of work? - [Andy] It's a little small. - It is a little small. - [Jake] It's small, man. - I know it's small, Jake! Telling me it's small some more doesn't change anything. You sound like Yvonne. - [Jake] I was gonna say, is that a soft spot for you? It seem like you've heard that a few times. (laughs) It's better, but the frame is awful. - [Andy] Yeah, the frame doesn't really work. - [Jake] You should paint the frame black. - Yeah, I could paint the frame, but like- - [Jake] Can you do it right now for me? - No, I can't paint the frame right- - Why not? - Well, I mean... - Do you have gaffer tape? - He's like, \"Well, you know, I could.\" (Jake laughing) (spray can hissing) - Oh really? (spray can hissing) Hm-hmm. Not bad, hey Andy? - [Andy] Not bad! - Now for the real maneuver. Getting everything assembled and on the wall without getting paint on myself or anything else. - [Jake] Especially not this white carpet. (laughs) - Yeah, you boys ready? - [Jake] What are the odds he drops it? (glass clanging) (everyone laughing) Very high! (laughs) - Okay, it's in. The glass is in. (cardboard thumping) - Wow, look at that! It looks better than it did. - [Linus] It's temporary, it's temporary. - It's a solid, I'm gonna give you a 6 1/2. 6 1/2. All right, we're gonna try the optimization. (speakers beeping) (speakers squeaking) (pleasant jingle) It's pretty good. - It's a lot better than just a sound bar. - Way better than just a sound bar. - And that was the goal. - Especially in this environment, just a sound bar would be awful, probably. - This is not bad though. This room like feels good. - The egg's a little weird. - Yeah, the egg's weird. Look it's from my grandmother, okay? (Jake laughing) (dramatic film playing on speaker) - Works pretty good. It's a little bit, I feel like it is cockeyed a little bit. But you know, maybe if I just sit. This is pretty good. It's definitely not the theater room. - No, but- - But it's pretty damn good for what it is. - It was never gonna be the theater room. - I would say this is excellent for what we're trying to do. Being able to get this level of surround sound- - But stealthy. - In this form factor, looking this good, in this kind of space, was unheard of until this kind of product existed. One thing with the QD-OLEDS- - The sub has to come out. - Yeah, one thing with the QD-OLEDS is it seems like they reflect more light. So the black doesn't look as black in a lit room like this. But it's still way better than an LCD. Holy (beep). Look at how red that is. The TV being the center channel actually helps those speakers, being so high, not sound so weird. - Yep. Perfect world, I think what I would like to do is get those out a little bit farther. - And that one, down there. - And then move the TV up and get a super slim speaker and mount it under the TV to make up the difference in height. 'Cause they do have a speaker output on the TV so it'll pass through. That's a project for another day though. For now, this room is freaking awesome. Just like our sponsor. Wealthfront.

    "description": "RhinoShield Website -  RhinoShield Amazon (USA Link) -  RhinoShield Amazon (International) -   Follow me on Twitter for giveaway -   Had the chance to check out some new products for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus from RhinoShield. This video features the Crash Guard Bumper and screen protector for the iPhone 7.  From the manufacturer -   ULTRA THIN, STRONG AND BEAUTIFULLY DESIGNED Marriage of protection and aesthetic. the CrashGuard case for iPhone 7 will protect your phone from everyday knocks and drops to at least 11 feet while still looking stylish and minimalistic.  PROTECTION. REINVENTED CrashGuard is a hybrid case built from hard and soft polycarbonate. Our unique polycarbonate material, unlike commonly used TPU, offers excellent drop protection by absorbing shock. The soft inner shell uses our ShockSpread technology with the honeycomb structure to enhance the drop protection by suspending the iPhone from any surface.  EASY GRIP RhinoShield CrashGuard has a matte finish which enhances the grip on your device. This finishing also serves to make the cover more durable, as it is harder to scratch. We have devoted great effort to push the technical limits in order to keep the thickness of the case under 0.9 inch which is the first of its kind in the rugged bumper case market. This makes the cases sleek, strong and durable.  PERFECT FIT The ports are compatible with most headphones and third party charging accessories. We also make sure all buttons are fully functional and accessible with sturdiness to avoid accidental press.  LIGHT WEIGHT The case weight less than 0.5 ounce which is much lighter than all rugged cases. We want to provide maximum protection at minimum weight, so that the cases are fully capable of providing full impact protection while not obstructing your user experience.  LIFETIME REPLACEMENT POLICY RhinoShield offers lifetime replacement policy on all products with friendly customer service. Find our customer service email on our website (Evolutive Labs) Make sure to buy from authorized resellers, EvolutiveLabs, BrandsWalk and Adorama, to get a new and genuine product.  *Sponsored by RhinoShield  FOLLOW ME IN THESE PLACES FOR UPDATES Twitter -  Facebook -  Instagram -  Google Plus -",

    "transcript": "The iPhone 7. It's a hot phone. Right?! A hot device. Everybody is talking about it, everybody wants one. They wanna get a fresh, smooth, nice looking new phone. But here's a thing you DON'T think about. You don't think about shattering that brand new device, do you? You don't think about the what the screen is gonna look like when little shards of glass getting up underneath your skin. There's something you can do, to avoid that from ever happening. Or at least, that's what Rhinoshield has told me. They reached out, they said, \"Lew, we would love to sponsor an episode and we want to send you the iPhones.\" There's one here on the table, TWO more right here! They're like, \"Do whatever you want, beat them up, slam them with a hammer!\". But, assuming that we have success here, I'm just going to give these away because I don't think anything is about to get destroyed right now. So, Rhinoshield - who are they? They make various accessories for smartphones. iPhone, iPhone 7 as I mentioned. But also even the new Pixel phone. According to Jack they put 4000lbs of weight on top of this screen protector. I feel like I want to test that too, so I don't know, maybe in an upcoming video. But anyways, that's been pre-installed on this iPhone 7, but they also have this product right: the bumper case. This is the new thing right here. It exceeds military drop test standards, it's easy to grip, light-weight... This is kind of important, because the iPhone 7 is super slippery. Especially the color I like best, which is the matte black. It's one thing to be able to grip onto it to avoid those drops in the first place. They claim you can drop this from 11 feet. Do we have 11 feet in here? Custom formulated polymer, honeycomb structure... Pretty slim, pretty sleek...let's see what it looks like Just like that. Okay, so now we have something to grip onto here. Now, it is raised up a little bit, so when you put it down on a flat surface, Your device is not touching that surface, even though it's exposed. Cutouts for all the necessary areas... If you do end up using this with the screen protector as well, you can see that it fits in there perfectly. It's not like it's getting all squished up against the bumpers. They are made to work together, alright. Now before we get to the... (Nearly uses hammer) I`m going to get up higher than before in this show. Look, I`m taking the phone with me. This is unprecedented! Guy`s, we are up higher than ever before. Probably about 6 feet up here. Or I could go higher... Ok, never mind. Now that`s probably like 8 feet. I just want the perfect drop to get through here. Are you ready Jack? 3.2.1. (Phone drops) Ohhh! Hah! Would you look at that! Complete and utter survival. A lot of the time you end up with a smashed screen. It hits on the corner. And you get those little cracks from the entire display. From the amount of pressure, that has to be absorbed in the glass itself. You are getting some drop protection and it's a huge improvement over just having the bare phone. That`s all fine and dandy. Fun and Games. You came here to see if it can hold up. To a hammer. Now of course we have the screen protector on there So this is the moment of truth. I`m going to take a hammer to it. Cross your fingers. Let`s see what happens. Maybe just start lets just give her a few... Ahh, right! Alright alright alright! It kind of bounces off it Is it time to step it up a notch?! It`s time to get crazy! Here we go! Ohhh! Woo! Woo! Wow! Come on! That is shocking! I don`t know if i can hit it harder. Do you want me to hit it harder again? About to mess up something. Wow! Can you show the people what`s happening here? That`s full blast man! Even the screen protector after that beating is in still pretty good shape. I don`t know if people know... How easily things smash. iPhone 5S here... Does not work. Did you water damage it? Ohh! Rest in Peace to Jack`s old iPhone 5S. So before I take off... I just want to remind you guys... Cool people at Rhino Shield. They send a bunch of stuff. Look at this! It`s all for you. I have the details in the description.. But follow me on twitter... and I'll be sending this stuff out to... maybe you!",

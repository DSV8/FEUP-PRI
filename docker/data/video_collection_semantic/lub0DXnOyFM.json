    "transcript": "for today's video I bought I think five monitors that cost about a hundred dollars each so that hopefully by the end of the video we can see which one is the least likely to aggravate your glaucoma [Music] Contender number one is this Sansui es 24f1 I'm sure all of the monitors are going to have at least equally sexy names it is a 24 inch monitor that has USBC which is reasonably useful it's full HD and has an above 60hz refresh rate which is great for some additional smoothness while gaming and then according to the box it's got reasonable color space coverage and it's frameless and I bought this provocatively named Sansui off of Amazon Canada for the equivalent of 97 US Dollars although bear in mind these prices fluctuate as wildly as employment figures at a Fan Company accessory wise it comes with everything you need to get started so there's this external power brick there's a pretty losery stand down there which we'll talk about later cable wise Sansui spoils us with both an HDMI and USB type-c cable nice and finally in terms of I O It's Perfectly reasonable and we even get the inclusion of our old friend the Mesozoic period part Contender number two is the pixio PX22 with literally no other information on the box but according to the Amazon listing it's also a 1080p display like the Sansui one with a 75 Hertz refresh rate which I think is great to see at this price point oh and that price point is an eye-watering 98 US Dollars it has probably the thinnest sand I've ever seen on a monitor it's so tiny and cute cable wise this one also comes with an external power brick and an HDMI cable and finally in terms of i o it is very similar to the i o on the Sansui except we don't have a USBC port on here which makes it a little less convenient to use with certain laptops oh and both the Sansui and the pixio have vase amounts on the back Contender number three is the kurui I think a 24 E4 which is a 24 inch monitor again with very little information on the box instead they decided to go with this gamer graphic I guess now specs wise the E4 is suspiciously good considering that I paid the equivalent of 102 US dollars for it it was on sale but still and for that money apparently you're getting a 165 Hertz VA panel with a one millisecond response time which should make it a god gaming panel but it's got my Spidey Sense dingling accessory wise the suspicious monitor comes with a display port cable which is very gamery and an external power brick the stand is about as losery as the other two monitors but it has a much more complete IO it's got two inch HDMI ports Contender number four is another kurui monitor but this one is the 24n1 another 24 inch monitor that also has some gamer branding on the box specs wise the N1 seems a lot more realistic than the other kurui monitor and price wise I got it for a little bit more than the other monitor but it wasn't on sale accessory wise the N1 comes with a very standard HDMI cable and power brick in terms of i o compared to the other monitors it seems to be on the Spartan end of standard and for the final Contender I went a bit name brand with this Samsung SR-71 which is another 24 inch monitor in fact specs wise aside from the one outlier all of these monitors are very similar and we didn't even have to pay any more for a Samsung and in terms of accessories you get what I'd say is a better external power brick solution because you have the power brick and then a separate power cable for it so that you can get longer reach out of it and then it also comes with an HDMI cable what's been really good is all of the monitors in this Roundup have vase amounts on the back but I do still want to talk about the terrible stands on all of them which we'll do in a second ioi is this monitor is right in the middle of the pack although we get a little joystick to control the OSD as opposed to a bunch of buttons [Music] now ergonomically all five of these monitors kind of suck equally it's very difficult to pick a winner because they all have the same problem and the problem is that they have these very low stands with no height adjust which means that when you're using them just on their own you have to peer down at them and the reason this is a problem is if you're using your PC for ages and you're looking down it's just not good for your back it's going to give you neck pain and stuff like that it just don't do that if your monitor is very low now put it on something so that it brings it into your eye line it'll make a big difference to like your just general Comfort long term using your PC now luckily all of them do come with vase amounts which is great it helps the problem but if you're buying a hundred dollar monitor you don't really want to also have to buy a Visa stand for it why not just spend that money on a monitor that comes with a better stand but with that monitor placement lecture out of the way let's get into the first impressions [Music] foreign just a quick heads up in terms of use case I'm going to primarily focus on gaming for this video but we'll mention some other things as well now straight off the bat with the little pixio monitor the image quality falls apart the moment you're not looking directly at it and aside from that because of how the iOS angled down it's all just sticking out the bottom of the monitor like that and there's nothing you can do about it I mean the HDMI port is right here now my modern standards the 22-inch pixio is a Post-It note of a monitor but because it's still 1080p the image is actually very sharp like it looks pretty good and it's 75 Hertz so it feels reasonably smooth as well that is maximum volume on the speakers and not only is it barely audible the sound quality is also horrible I don't really know why they bother putting speakers on a monitor like this I really like the 75 Hertz on this monitor it makes a pretty big difference over 60hz the colors are definitely not great but in terms of brightness it's not quite Max brightness here and it is bright enough even in this quite well-lit room the motion rendering is perfectly fine we don't have any obvious ghosting over any of the image yeah I like the image quality is not amazing but it's very usable it is Tiny though and after a reasonably competent first Contender things got dicey now the San Tsui uh is already very concerning but before we get to that it's a 24-inch monitor as opposed to the 22-inch pixio it's also 1080p with 75 Hertz and it also has the cable under dangle issue of the pixio oh yeah this is a VA panel oh this is a bad VA panel oh no this is a horrible monitor what in the world oh this is a really not nice monitor is there anything we can do about that in the OSD like and after spending a while playing around with the OSD I just couldn't get it to not assault my eyeballs I'm not sure if you can tell over camera but this monitor is wild now I don't want to only be negative so um in terms of positives it's switched on I guess yeah I don't know I I I don't know if I've got more than that [Applause] wow the kurai also has some pretty rough motion rendering it's definitely better than the Sansui but to be fair rubbing gasoline into my eyes is likely better than the Sansui monitor yeah there is like a bit of ghosting around stuff and despite it being at 75 Hertz again it doesn't look as smooth and as natural as the the little pixio monitor did the N1 also has the same dangly problem that the other two monitors had but it does have a slightly taller stand the additional size going from 22 inch to 24 is is quite nice it feels a reasonable bit bigger I'm surprised that this is what's happening here but so far in terms of image quality the unassuming little pixio curb Stomps these other two monitors so this kurai e 3 or E4 or whatever is actually a 165 Hertz panel which is crazy that's like more than double any of the other ones but it's a really bad one oh no oh that motion rendering like the moment you move everything just smears wow I don't know I I feel like the 165 Hertz is actually a detriment to this monitor because look at that movement the motion rendering on all of these monitors aside from the little pixio has been deal breakingly bad I then again spent a while playing around with various OSD settings changing the frame rate of the Monitor and turning on panel overdrive in the OSD helped a little bit but damn this monitor was also doing unconsensual things to my eyeballs [Music] I'm really hoping that the Samsung is less terrible than the other ones 72 Hertz okay that's weird now at this point I'm not even sure I remember what correct colors look like but the Samsung's looking okay you know it's it's not doing too bad there's a bit of a brown tinge to the color but as we've seen it could be way worse and at least the motion rendering is a lot better than the other monitors aside from the pixio I think the pixio still looks better but this is way better than like the Sansui for example but in all fairness I feel like watching my grandmother emerge from a bath is less of an affront to my eyes than that's ensuing but yeah I I guess by these standards the Samsung's doing okay foreign first impression I went and measured all of these monitors and I was surprised at how well they measured none of them measured great and some of them worse than others but compared to the image quality I was seeing in game I was really surprised by the results but I think what's happening here is that all of these monitors are okay when it comes to static images but aside from the pixio and at a stretch of the Samsung the image quality disintegrates the moment the monitors have to render any kind of movement and my best guess as not a monitor engineer for why this is happening is I think the manufacturer's overclocked panels that couldn't handle it to hit those 75 Hertz and 16500 refresh rates that look so good on the spec sheet but then it completely ruins the panel's motion rendering that's just my guess though either way the pixio and Adder push the Samson are the only two of these monitors that wouldn't at least cause a fresh glaucoma [Music] so which of these five monitors would I buy um none of them I I wouldn't buy any of them what I would do instead is save up a bit of money and buy this LG monitor which at the moment is on sale for a hundred and thirty dollars so it doesn't even cost that much more than these monitors again bear in mind availability and price does fluctuate wildly with this stuff but it is a significantly better display I spent a month living with that monitor and I really liked it you know monitors make such a big difference they're the thing that you see your games through and they last a long time I just I wouldn't cheap out on a monitor I'd save up and buy something better however if I was forced to pick one like for example it's the apocalypse these are the only five monitors available in the entire world I'm a little bit blind due to radiation poisoning I picked the pixio with very little hesitation and maybe give an honorable mention to the Samsung though those two are in a different League to the other three monitors especially the VA kurui Monitor and that's at Suey display I I'm surprised companies sell monitors that terrible in 2023 even for a hundred dollars so yeah if these are the only five monitors in the world and all I want to really do with it is read emails and occasionally stalk people on Facebook I'd pick one of those too but I don't know if I'd be happy about it which I think brings me to the end of the video thank you very much for watching if you enjoyed the video consider watching another one a suggestion will pop up in a second subscribe to the channel for more videos and until the next video bye-bye [Music] thank you",

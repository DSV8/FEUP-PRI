But since then both Microsoft, NVIDIA and AMD have rolled out new updates....but do those finally make HDR a must-have feature for gaming monitors?

    "transcript": "Yo Dmitry what's up I'm really sorry about the update update what update ah the windows update so I feel like we've all been there deferring Windows updates because of many reasons but the latest fall creators update build 1803 supposedly has fixed a lot of issues surrounding HDR so let's revisit the topic make sure to check out our original video on HDR here but yeah let's revisit topic talk about the desktop environment and the gaming environment with HDR with the latest Windows Update to see if it is satisfactory right after this are you ready okay watch this so that is what the components must feel like inside the H 500 P managed by Coolermaster check it out in the description below so my HDR experience originally began with the LG 27 UK 850 it's an awesome display supports HDR10 spec and supposed to deliver a brighter and the more vibrant picture but my experience with this whole HDR thing was not satisfactory for many reasons not because of the display but because of Windows potentially driver updates and game updates too so I experienced a common pink issue where the screen would be covered in this pink overlay as soon as the HDR would be turned on that was a windows issue so that's been solved the desktop could also be way too dim for regular operation outside of like consuming HDR content originally so now that's also been solved and for games I had strange artifacts with colours HDR would simply not engage and exiting a non HDR game would sometimes turn HDR on my desktop all those issues have now been fixed with this build 18:03 and to expand my sample size for HDR panels we have the 38 wk 95 C from LG it's also an HDR10 panel and I've tested both Intel and Ryzen systems along with nvidia and AMD graphics cards to see if HDR plays better on one or the other and so with the latest 1803 build enabling HDR on the desktop gives us proper bright image and now we have brightness slider for SDR content we didn't have this before this means you can adjust the brightness of your desktop or if you're watching something on YouTube that's not HDR you still get that proper brightness levels on those videos the hiccup however is Chrome for some reason and how the browser is basically gray instead of white and that reflects also on SD our videos but it still weirdly supports HDR playback and display that super bright and vibrant image through Chrome one of those HDR examples would be Austin's iPhone 10 review which is absolutely stunning well done and so this chrome hiccup is kind of annoying because if you want to have HDR enabled on the desktop by default all the time you will need to use Firefox that the displays all the content properly without having it too dim Netflix and HDR is fantastic which is one of the reasons why you potentially want to keep HDR on the desktop on all the time so you don't have to go back and forth of enabling it and disabling it because you cannot assign HDR turning on by app just yet I'm sure that will come soon but HDR on Netflix is absolutely incredible and there's so many good HDR shows that I would say deliver a superior image in HDR versus SDR and one of the reasons why you want to consider an HDR monitor and so HDR 10 displays have their space in the market to push HDR content but to really fully utilize the potential you definitely have to go with Dolby vision and OLED displays because that is the future of HDR now the gaming experience visually is basically the same but now without all the bugs which is awesome now I've been kind of hesitant to recommend HDR panels for gamers because the list of HDR supported titles is pretty short but the triple-a titles now pretty much all of them will support HDR so you know Far Cry 5b f1 the shadow of war destiny 2 and the color experience through all of these titles is basically identical but I want to clear out this misconception or the faulty assumption that you'll get deeper blacks color accurate image and what are some higher contrast with HDR because that has been not the case for me actually it's been exactly the opposite in my experience now sure the picture is more vibrant and brighter as that's boosted to 100% by default in HDR but you don't get more dynamic range from the game you just kind of see more shadow area because they are lifted like in this be f1 scene but mainly it's all about that color pop that could make the experience better so far cry 5 for me is too bright and I like the less punchy colors of SDR but destined to an HDR looks fantastic with appropriate color boost and extra detail in this whole like cartoony environment and the same with Assassin's Creed origins that game in HDR is colorful and just absolutely awesome but I would advise from playing during the darker conditions to close to the display because it is just way too bright and I'm just worried about like my eyes hurting after a while now some games allow luminance adjustment like in bf1 and a co but for color changes you can cycle between picture profiles from the monitor itself also some games allow you to turn HDR on in the settings even choose between HDR 10 or dolby vision depending on the game and some enabled it by default based on the desktop color space and I'm happy to report I've had zero bugs with HDR and gaming so jumping back into bf1 it remembers my HDR settings but exiting back into Windows that is not HDR disables HDR and there is no that color cycling between back and forth so that's awesome it seems like both Nvidia and AMD have been on top of their driver support also Windows updates solved for majority of those things too so if you are considering in the HDR display now potentially now is the time now in case you're wondering performance difference between HDR and SDR is not significant only a few frames lower on average with HDR turned on and for me personally once I tried out HDR with certain games like this thing to is fantastic Assassin's Creed origins I cannot go back to SDR just looks too flat and not saturated enough or vibrant enough for me to experience the same gameplay and so really this whole update with the build 1803 definitely is a huge point for HDR to drive that whole acceptance forward because many people in our original video are saying that it could be potentially because my Ryzen system may be the monitor was faulty maybe my graphics cards were something was happening with them but in fact it was just all windows-based issues that have now been resolved and the HDR experience as a whole is a lot more complete than before now what excites me the most when it comes to gaming with this whole high dynamic range stuff is g-sync HDR because their panels are going to be reaching that a thousand dense brightness for a spec which is still way too bright you gonna have to tone it down in order to not burn your retinas but they're approaching it from like true blacks or like deep blacks quantum dot panels so that is where things going to get really exciting for you know delivering a beautiful deep contrast the image that's still vibrant is bright and you can see all the detail without needing to sort of lift the shadow stuff that we normally see with these panels with HDR 10 so g-sync HDR is super exciting and yeah I'm just looking forward to playing around with it myself too but I'm curious to hear what your experience has been like with HDR have you played any games did you like the color just like the contrast and you know once I started playing HDR on Netflix on these panels I just cannot go back to anything else it just looks so vibrant and rich and colors and the whole idea is when you enable those HDR profiles the monitor doesn't dynamically calibrate based on the areas it's just kind of like a filter but that filter is also as a secondary layer pre applied to the source footage the way the artist intended for you to look at HDR10 content so it's not based on the monitor specs of like how they perceive HDR to look it's more like taking that information and displaying how the artist wanted you to see it I hope that makes sense yeah join the wireless club with Corsairs new dark core Mouse play the way you want with 9 programmable buttons aligned in the comfortable shape and fantastic sensor you can trust and crazy good Wireless performance plus Qi wireless charging built-in focus on the game the dark core will do the rest alright guys so that is it for my HDR update it's working fine there are no bugs so make sure to check out this other relevant content subscribe to our new boot sequence channel right over here and we'll see you make city back the offender you",

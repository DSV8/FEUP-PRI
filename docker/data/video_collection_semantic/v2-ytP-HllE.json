    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going Dave 2d here, so these are some new speakers from Razer They're called the Razer Nomo and they start at $99 which is relatively inexpensive for a pair of decent speakers now they come in three variants They have the base $99 version They have this one which is 150 bucks and they're adding RGB lighting as well as a DAC And then they have their super premium model which is their 400 or 500 dollar model? It's called the Noma Pro and I was able to hear all of them at CES and Obviously the 500 dollar one sounds the best has got THX certification all that stuff But I feel like these ones here are where it's at these sound really good for the money, so what makes these things different? Right away is their look? If these don't look like your standard bookshelf speakers like if you go with the clips Pro media or logitech speakers are just your standard Bookshelf speakers they have a certain kind of dull look to them these don't look like that these definitely have some gamer DNA in it It looks more modern to me with a pretty clean aesthetic now the build quality on this thing is I mean it's your average Kind of build quality it is plastic. It's not like wood or anything like that, but it's made well There's three inch drivers up at the front and then there's a base port on the back and this one here the $150 nomic Romo has RGB lighting that you can control in their software now You can do some crazy stuff in there Or you can just keep it basic and use one of the profiles just to add some color to your setup it is nice to have that availability though in terms of connectivity you get your power connection and then on my model because it's the Gnome of chroma it has a DAC so you get used B connectivity And you have your regular auxilary analog connection and in your headphone jack the controls are really simple. There's two knobs There's a volume dial and then there's a base dial in it first one. I was checking this thing I was like what they only have base tile like there's no treble controls, but the way that they've done It is actually really smart the base control has automatic gain so if you increase or lower the base it Automatically adjusts the EQ of the sounds of the base will scale Distortion free it's actually really nice to have your base cranked up your volume cranked up and everything still sounds clear So how do these things sound honestly they sound really good? I kind of expected them to sound not great because it's a razer product right not that it would be bad But razer doesn't do speakers. They're not known for speakers so when they bring this thing out. It's like it looks cool But are they really gonna sound good For $99 I really like the audio quality from these But where they shine is in games the positional audio and these things are excellent those higher Frequencies are really pronounced and clean and you can hear footsteps well I don't have a way to showcase the stereo separation properly with my mics But I'm very comfortable gaming on this thing now Compared to other speakers that have used for gaming like the clips Pro media or the audio engine a 2 plus or the kanto yu6? These aren't like the best sounding things out there That's all I'm trying to say, but they sound really really good for the price And I really like how these things handle the higher frequencies when you lower the bass you can really hear player locations on these speakers Okay, there's a few things that I don't like about the noma speaker the first is that it's a little top-heavy I understand that that's the look. That's the design aesthetic They've gone for but I wish the base plate was a little bit wider because right now It's got this tendency to wobble a little bit if you hit it backwards switch a little bit dangerous the other thing I don't love is that the auxilary and the headphone jack are on the back of the speaker And I understand that for bookshelf speakers. That's pretty normal, but because these are gaming speakers You kind of expect them to be closer up to the front so you can just access them easier But that's just what we have here and the last thing is I don't like how the chroma version is $50 more a lot of money for just RGB lighting and a USB connection which I don't know it doesn't really make that much sense To me okay overall great speakers for 99 bucks I feel like these are these aren't the speakers to beat And I'm saying these are like you know the best speakers out there for 99 bucks But if you like something that looks a little bit different looks pretty cool And has that way to complement your setup with different colors and stuff you should check these things out, okay? Hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs. If you liked it subs if you loved it. See you guys next time",

You're typically using them outside or at least a light source so you might never need to charge these with a cable ever again.

    "transcript": "- We're going in blind, everyone. It's a new dawn. It's the Los Angeles Earphones from Urbanista, which are apparently solar powered and I live in the Pacific Northwest where there is no solar power. What? These aren't ear buds. These are actually headphones, blind. (laughs) This looks like the actual retail packaging. Let's see if I can get this out of here without actually opening it, there we go. Los Angeles, Los Angeles solar powered headphones, always charging, Powerfoyle by Exeger. It's a cool box. All the same crap there. There's no power above the moon. Why would they even put the moon on here then? They didn't enumerate all the other various circumstances where I'm not gonna get any power. - [Jono] Moonlight is the bad light. - Okay, there's no moon power guys, I'm sorry, that's V2. Let's just check them out though. Okay, we've got a case and it looks kind of nice. I like this little, what do they call that on a saddle, bullhorn, holding that together, and what's this, a charging cable, perhaps. They really don't stand by this infinite battery thing, do they? You know what, you know, that's why they have the moon on the back. If you use it at night, you're gonna need this. This case is interesting. It's soft, it's actually squishy. It's probably cardboard or something, but there is a little squish to it. It's kind of rigid. Wait, maybe that's just the headphone. Yeah, yeah, that's just, this doesn't have walls. So these walls are just stretchy like this. Cool, there they are. And yeah, I mean, it's not nothing. It's case is all right, and here they are. - [Jono] How big are they? - They're all black, they are 40 millimeter drivers. They are dynamic drivers. Left and right clearly marked here. I'm immediately thinking that this driver looks like it might touch my ears, which is the worst, that always hurts. The ear cups are fairly squishy. They take a while to expand. They look like the kind of ear cups where if your ears are small, they might just go in there and then these would cease to be on your headphones, but they are designed to be on ears. You can see these cups swivel, which is nice when you have them like this, 'cause this can sometimes be a little scarf, you know, you're on the bus and it's just, windows are all fogged up, it's a winter and crap. When you're outside it's good. When you're inside, you might want to lay that down. Although they really have a tendency though to go fully there and then it's kind of weird. I feel like it's choking me out a bit. I really liked the look, this like soft touch, I guess rubber finish on the plastic here is nice. The branding, the Urbanista kind of iconography there is cool. I can see there's some buttons, three buttons here. They're really tactile. Oh, sound is not consistent. It looks like there's a microphone there. On the other cup, we've got a USB-C port and another button. That button's way louder. The headband we've got foam all the way around but damn that is thin. That basically just like, looks like a thin veneer of leatherette over top of like something hard. And then it looks like it breaks right here. That's where there's actually some foam and that, oh yeah, that does not look very pillowy. That looks like it's gonna compress and hurt right away. And then says Powerfoyle on the top, which I guess is the name of the technology for the solar power. I guess, is that the solar panel at the top, this whole thing? I'm told that it's the same technology as a solar panel you see on like a calculator and those never died and there are way smaller than all this. Let's put them on. - [Jono] Whoa, before that. - What? Oh my God. Yeah, this is how big they are. This is our new short circuit merch, isn't that cool? You guys got merch, you guys, us? Am I, do I work here? (laughs) Cool, you can get blue bananas. This is pretty dope. You know what, and this doubles as a very discreet airline pillow. Oh, and there's the logo on there too. This is really cool. Don't try to peel it. All right, I wanna wear them. This is left. The caliper pressure is pretty tight. Yeah, my ear is like, this half of my ear is just immediately inside of that, which is probably not gonna be great. They don't go that small. I'm on the smallest setting out and I think I would leave it there. I don't have like a tiny dome, I have like a media melon. So if you got a tiny dome, maybe look elsewhere, and this is as big as they get. If you got like just a huge knock and noggin actuation of this, it seems to be friction base. It's not ratchet, it's continuous. Oh, it just powered on, I heard a little voice. There they are, 76% charged. Now, I wonder if they'll go up as we sit here under these studio lights. looks like there's three ANC settings. There's ANC on, there's ambient sound transparency mode, and there's default, and I can hear a voice cue when I switch that. - [Virtual Voice Assistant] ANC, ambient sound, default. - Nice. Draining, it's draining right now, oh God. It's draining faster and faster. This is so cool that it shows you the rate of the drain. Wait, now it's gaining? Oh, wait a second, it's simultaneously gaining and draining, but overall it's draining. That's how I'm reading this. What's this button do? I don't know, do I wanna look, why would I wanna look at a picture of it if I know what they look like, okay. What does this do? There's a feature button, I'm guessing that's the big one. Long press on that same button. Activate voice assistant, that sounds good, or toggle ANC and each other stuff, yeah, okay. On ear detection that's on music. We'll pause when I take the headphones off. Decent settings, cool. Well, let's listen to the sound quality right after this message from our sponsor. Thanks to Corsair for sponsoring this video. Corsair recently launched their first gaming monitor, the Xenon. It features an ultra slim 32 inch QHD IPS panel up to 165 Hertz refresh rate, quantum dot technology, the best, with 100% SRGB, 100% Adobe RGB and 98% at DCI-P3 color gamma coverage, which is the one that matters. And that will get you more vivid, natural colors. Mount your camera, your mic, your lighting with an integrated multi mount point, built into the aluminum stand and learn more at the link below. Get a Xenon guys, why not? All Corsair build, let's go. You know what I'll give it is they're pretty silent. They're not too creaky. That looks nice, with that little marketing. Facebook Meta. This one's pretty good. The base is pretty good. Billie Eilish, you need the base. The music is so like after party. So like, meh, this bar is supposed to be closed right now, but it's not and you're allowed to smoke in here. Hold on, let me put you in transparency mode. Oh, it pauses the music and goes ANC, pause ambient sound. What'd you say? Yeah, I don't think this is really doing much. (finger snaps) Okay, it was, it was. It's not that aggressive though, it wasn't like really amplifying everything around me. Let's put the ANC back on. Ah, the interruption's brutal. Oh, this album, this is a good Hi-Fi album. Pretty warm sound. This guitar sounds nice and soft. Left, left ear just sounds so much more prominent. Maybe I'm going deaf. The backwards, you got to test the backwards on because if you're one of those weirdos and I've been this guy, who wears actual headphones to the gym and you're holding dumbbells and you go down to like bench press or do flies or something laying down, I've worn headphones where they're like, (laughs). Yeah, I think with the $200 range these sound okay. I'm still gonna try some rock and roll music. You could be mine. Let's turn it up and see how harsh and crappy they sound or if they get distorted. This is a, don't go that loud. This is louder than I want to listen to, but I could see myself maybe putting up this loud in certain circumstances, and it's not that loud. Although I am listening to title and sometimes it's just quieter. I find like I have to turn my AVR up higher than I would on YouTube Music, for example. Axl Rose, man. (laughs sarcastically) His voice is hilarious. I'm satisfied, I've made my final appraisal of this product. I think that they sound good enough. I think that a lot of what you're paying for is going to go to non-oral properties such as the solar powered thing. But I think if the solar power thing appeals to you at all, it has some value for you. Like if you're willing to pay 20 or $30 for that, I think the sound is like, good enough for this price range. They don't sound markedly worse than like say truly wireless earphones in that price range. Although I'm not going to sit here and say, there's not $200 headphones that sound better than these, there are, but with that, with the look of them, the overall build quality, it's got the companion app. There's no EQ in the companion app, but I think these are like, they're decent value. Even if they didn't have the solar thing, they would still be like, all right. Without the solar thing, they probably should be like 130 or something, 150. The biggest thing you wanna evaluate in a review, which this is not, is how well does the solar aspect of it work and I can't do that right now. And let's see what happened after like three minutes of music, whatever that was, searching for device again, come on, man. Baloney. - [Brandon] Baloney. - What? Dude, I can't get back into the app. I'm sorry guys, we can't get back in. What does it say in Bluetooth power level? Cell is at 80. Cannot confirm or deny. I will say they don't seem to be, they're a bit heavier. They're a bit heavier a little and bulkier than on normal headphone this size, but it's not really, not like too noticeable. The weighting of them like you can tell there's weight in the headband, but it's not onerous. I would be concerned about again, how comfortable they're gonna be after an hour, especially with the actual weight up there and the thin padding of the headband. But while I've been wearing them here, they've been fine. If I was going to LA, I probably wouldn't even bother bring my cable. If I knew that, yeah, it's gonna be sunny from six to six, I just put in by the window. That's actually pretty sweet. Whatever I can do in my life to have a lighter kit, a lighter everyday carry, the best. Like if you have a car that doesn't need keys, or if you have a garage opener, so you don't need a fob, you have a pin pad, like a code on your door. You don't need a house keys, I love that stuff. So if you're one of those people, these could be awesome for you. But if you don't mind just plugging your headphones in like what, once every couple months, honestly, my earphones, I use it in the gym 'cause I'd never work out. I'd charged them like twice, like I never have to charge them. So what are you really gaining? I don't know. Your mileage may vary, but I think these, they don't suck. Of course, inconclusive findings on the solar panel. You know another real cool thing is there's no like striations on the solar panel and you can't see all of the cells. It really just looks normal. No one would know that these are weird. So that's very cool, that's another bonus for them, but yeah, you'll have to check out other in-depth reviews of this product to know whether the recommendation is, I'm just saying right now it's not a don't buy. So thanks for watching Short Circuit. If you like our headphone or earphone reviews, then check out more of them by me or Riley, the other earphone guy here. David, you've done them? - [David] One. - Watch David's.",

    "transcript": "- [Narrator] You've seen smartphones, you've seen smart watches. Well today at IFA 2018, I got to see well, something in between. (light music) Right away, I gotta fess up folks, this video is gonna be light on details. This thing is so early that the people who built it, didn't even let me touch it. Those people are the crew at Nubia, a technology company spun off from ZTE a few years ago. That's important because it's a legit manufacturer, which isn't always guaranteed at a trade show where vapor wear is as common as actual products. If this thing, which is called the Alpha, by the way had borne a brand I'd never heard of, I'd probably never would've pointed a camera at it. Because while Nubia's press renders paint a rosy picture of a sleek benecit, the prototype on display had some rough edges. None the less, Nubia says it wants to get this thing on the market by holiday 2018. So what have we got? Well a rent round oled display, Nubia wouldn't say who built it, but it's probably LG or Samsung. Featuring a heavily customized build of Android, Nubia wouldn't say which version. There's a 4G radio inside so you can make and take calls with the embedded speaker. A camera, if you want to make those calls in for video. A sensor, to tell it which way is up so you can wear it on either wrist, and of course, an LTE modem for data surfing, so you can, I don't know, watch Instagram, TV. The demo loop on the floor showcased much more common smart watch functions like exercise timers, and music players, and the like. Which of course, begs the question, why buy this instead of just a regular smart watch? Scanning the companies official release gets you a bunch of bluff that doesn't say much. And asking for more concrete pricing details got me the same lack of answers. So what are we left with? Well not so much a product that I'm dying to review in the sense that I'll tell you whether or not you should buy it. Honestly, I doubt I'd say you should. But you know, that's not the only reason I do these videos. I mean, this, right here is one of the great reasons to come out to a trade show. You get to see concept models, companies, saying, hey you know what, this might be crazy, but we have the ability to build it. And we're bored with the status quo so here, maybe this is the future, what do you think? And even though this particular vision of the future sort of fizzled when Samsung pitched it a few years back, and this seems more like a publicity play than anything else, well, I'm just glad there are companies out there still willing to surprise us every now and then. This video was brought to you by thrifter, the new way to save money on everything on gadgets to home goods, by shopping based on the value, and not hype. Check out the latest deals at thrifter.com, and tell them Mr Mobile sent you. (light music) What do you think of the newbie at Alpha, is this the future? Or should it be left in the past? Draw up a line in the comments, let me know. And be sure you're subscribed to theMrMobile on YouTube in case I do end up trying this thing out in the real world someday. Until next time, thanks for watching, and stay Mobile my friends.",

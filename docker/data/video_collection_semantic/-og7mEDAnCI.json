    "transcript": "hello people I'm Dmitry and this is an absolutely unique product the HP Omen Mindframe the naming scheme is awesome the package is good although there absolutely no accessories you just get the headset itself and I feel like this is HP's way of experimenting with the market to see if this whole cooling situation will stick so the concept here is that we have thermal electrical coolers inside each ear cup there for cooling your ears so if your ears get warm if you're in a really warm environment then HP is trying to tackle that with actively cooling your ears so you can wear this headset and not get any heat accumulation and as a concept and idea it's pretty awesome while also kind of like flying by in that gimmicky territory I am excited to see if this will stick in the gaming sphere or it will be simply swept aside as too gimmicky so let's review right - this evolved with the times consider nvme storage today the new RC 100 brings affordable nvme storage into your hands with various capacities in this super compact form factor that plugs directly into your motherboard it's extremely powerful and utilizes the Sheba's advanced 3d flash memory for awesome speeds so you can be a happy user the RC 100 by Toshiba the nvme drive to consider check it out below alright guys so for the past two weeks I've been using this headset and tried to get into the mindset of HP trying to understand exactly why this exists so it's a pretty standard gaming headset for $200 very expensive Auto does go on sale quite often for $150 still quite expensive for that sale price anyway in terms of build quality it's fairly plastic it does creak a little bit when the ear cups are moving it has this self adjusting headband up top it is kind of like a pleather material so it should fit larger head sizes and accommodate smaller head sizes as well I am concerned about the red exposed cable on each side it is slightly bent already and I'm not sure about its longevity but like I said I feel like this is HP's way of experimenting with the market and not necessarily you know being super proud of this headset I find them pretty comfortable but they are extremely heavy at 475 grams compared to much lighter designs like the GSP 500 which is still a pretty bulky design but much lighter 358 grams and my favorite pair of all for gaming and editing the HD 58X at 260 grams we have a volume dial on the right ear cup nicely accessible the ear cushions are pretty deep not irritating pretty comfortable but they're not removable and of course RGB lining on the sides but you know it's tasteful nice ambient illumination of course it wouldn't be a gaming headset without it the microphone is muted when in the upright position you can see the red LED it is pretty flexible but in terms of sound quality it is just okay so this is what the microphone sounds like it's a little bit disappointing so there's a lot of noise in the background in terms of the vocal compression it's kind of nasally it's not too detailed and overall a little bit of disappointment and also when you mute the microphone there's a beep that also mutes the audio incoming so it's quite annoying if you have to mute it up you will lose your audio for a brief second this is the GSP 500 the headset that there's over $200 but you can hear the difference in terms of audio quality for the microphone and the vocals just a lot more body and richer sound so yeah and the headset is connected via USB with a braided cable that doesn't kink easy and also doesn't pass too much cabling noise when it's brushing against the shirt into the ear cup which is great and so the whole point of this headset is the cooling on the interior of what HP cost frost cap it's their branding terms for a thermal electrical cooler which means there are two semiconductor layers so when voltage passes through one of them it carries the heat away from one to the other and so that's what we have here we have a cooler side on the interior and the warmer heatsink type on the exterior inside the RGB elimination and it actually works in terms of cooling so I can put my fingers over here and feel like I'm touching really cold metal and that's pretty incredible so a few ears do you know sweat that is a really good mitigation strategy and you can also adjust the low to medium to high settings in the software which is pretty good and based on our flurry the maximum temperature or the minimum temperature we can achieve at maximum cooling setting is about 12 degrees Celsius and that is really cool in terms of the feature set and also the temperature and so for the first time I put these on I had the cooling capacity on high setting and I could feel the cold being radiated from the drive walls onto my ears you know literally cooling whatever was inside the ear cup and that is exactly what this headset is intended to do but multiple things to consider my ears are actually more sensitive to cold so I couldn't keep them on for a long time because my ears got like too cold I had to take them off right now it's like fall so I'll not necessarily need it and number two if your ears are potentially slightly larger or like stick out a bit more you might run into risk of making contact with that wall which is what Eber experienced and therefore it could be an extremely unpleasant experience of physically feeling that cold wall which is 12 degrees Celsius and therefore just not having a good time at all and the side effect is that warm plate on the exterior which is basically the heating that takes away the heat from the internal plate and it's kind of strange handling a headset that is warm on the outside but extremely cool inside the ear cups and HP warns that there might be condensation forming on the interior depending on the ambient temperature and this whole cooling thing works like it should it's not a gimmick we have literally cooler inside the ear cup that passes on you know you can feel the cooling kind of like radiating from that a little bit on plate and it would it should cool your ears no problem I don't need them because I have headphones that are open back and therefore never have any heat concentration and for even headsets that are totally closed back you might have some concentration of heat where the leather makes contact with your skin but my ears are never in that zone where like they they sweat on the exterior on the inside so for me this whole thing makes absolutely no sense but let me know if this is something that you might actually find useful and now the reason why I think this is fermentation product is because the driver software is so basic first it takes forever to load and we only have the RGB selection and the cooling selection um of those three profiles and absolutely nothing about the sound and it's weird because this is a USB headset it also has the surround sound enabled by default normally for USB headsets you'd have stereo mode and some form of EQ profile customization and then surround sound toggle but this one has neither and weirdly when you go into device properties enable the Windows sonic for headphones it makes absolutely no difference to the sound signature of this headset so you kind of locked in to what HP wants you to hear and you know I actually don't mind the sound signature profile of this headset it's very crystal clear lots of detail not harsh trouble either the bass is kind of like it's deep but it could have a slightly deeper impact the mid-range is clear it's like you know it's like the open but not too Airy so like I actually like the sound signature of this but the issue is having absolutely no customization and that is strange for a USB headset for example I recently started playing escape from tarkov a game where you have to absolutely listen to everything that's happening in your environment listen to footsteps where they're coming from the actual profile of where those footsteps are coming from in terms of ID stepping on glass wood or metal and I had absolutely no issues detecting all those elements in my surround environment and mindframe but of course for $200 price point you'd expect more like slightly deeper bass that is a little bit more controlled and not too open and of course all those you profile so you can tone down the treble if you find it too harsh and you know do all types of customization that we're so used to now I'm going to let Eva chime in on this conversation so you can get an opinion from both me and him Eber take it away design and build quality it's a complete disappointment especially for a $200 headset I wasn't expecting a plastic frame that actually creaks which is really unfortunate I have big ears so as soon as that where these headset they do get in contact with the drivers inside and as soon as I crank up the cooling to max setting which is the only way to control through the driver software there are no hardware buttons on this headset which is kind of unfortunate it gets really cold it almost gets to a point where it's almost you feeling you're you're touching like an aluminum surface first thing in the morning that's it's that cold alright guys so that is the omen mind frame a super cool name for a product by the way that has like kind of a gimmicky feature but that actually works in cooling your ears and the only drawbacks are the rest of the headset you know in terms of build quality it's extremely heavy it's kind of plasticy so I'm guessing a lot of that weight is with that thermal electrical cooler that's stuck inside the ear cups sound quality is actually pretty good the microphone for a USB headset is fine as well but the price is not competitive but of course I'm guessing there is that price premium because of that tech built in to cool your ears this is not something I would recommend but I'm guessing for a really hot environment where you do get that heat concentration stuck that cooling the active cooling would definitely prevent any heat concentration which is awesome but also you have to think about the actual headset design because going with open-back headset usually have absolutely no heat concentration because it is totally open like my HD 58X even in the summer absolutely no issues and I'm actually excited to try this out as well in the hot air environment just to see if this would make a difference all right guys I'm Dimitri how are Canucks let me know what you think of this whole concept of cooling you in the gaming headset I know it sounds gimmicky but I'm happy that HP has made it work and it's not like some some fans are spinning inside the ear cups but yeah check out the Sutherland content subscribe to a new boot sequence channel thanks to e4 a little collaboration and we'll see you next video",

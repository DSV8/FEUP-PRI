    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here. So Microsoft launched their Surface Laptop the other day, and I think it's a really cool product I'm personally very interested in it. I think it looks awesome I think they're going to sell lots of them, but I think there's some potential problems with this product And I wanted to go through them with you in case you're interested in purchasing one So the first thing is the design. I really like the design I think a lot of the interest about this product comes from the fact that it looks as good as it does because let's be honest if this thing was super ugly, it would be a much less exciting product, but it's really good-looking. So here we are. It's one hand openable. The keyboard and trackpad look really promising. But the most interesting thing about this product is the fact that they're using this Alcantara material on the keyboard deck, and if you're unfamiliar with it. It's this fabric type material It's a synthetic fabric that Microsoft uses on their signature keyboard on the Surface Pro product and it feels and looks really inviting to use. It's much more durable than what you would imagine a cloth type material to be but that being said it's not metal It's not plastic, so there's going to be some wear over time. Now, I've seen Alcantara keyboards that looked really good after six months, and I've also seen some that looked really worn down after six months So I don't know it's going to vary from person to person but one thing's for sure: you can't just replace the keyboard the way that you could on the Surface Pro because if you really wanted To and you had a gunky Surface Pro Type cover, you could just buy a new one for a couple hundred bucks This is built into the laptop. It's kind of like fused onto the keyboard deck I don't think it'll be as easy to just replace that. Okay. Let's talk about the operating system These come with Windows 10S and, if you want to the first year, you can upgrade it for free to Windows 10 Pro. After that first year, or after 2017, it's going to become a $50 upgrade. So the biggest difference between Windows 10 and Windows 10s is that 10s can't run any kind of executable program so any kind of like .exe file You can't run it. There's not even a command prompt. This is crippling to a lot of users. There's no steam There's no Chrome you're going to be stuck with Microsoft Edge and you're going to be running bing for the search engine It's streamlined and it focuses on the core of Windows, and I think for system administrators It's a lot easier to get something like this deployed. And for the user, you're getting a better battery life You're getting a faster experience like a more optimized experience, but it's a very limited experience. So if you're using just regular Applications that you're used to you're gonna have to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro Okay. Looking at the hardware, the base model comes with four gigs of RAM, and that is tight I really feel like they should have put an eight gigs and the argument is that for most people that are interested in this base Model So like the University student that doesn't have a lot of heavy computer tasks, four gigs should be enough Especially if you're not using Chrome. So if you're just web browsing editing PDf documents, typing up word documents Just doing very productivity focused tasks then yes, four gigs should be enough But the thing is, if you ever want to do something that's a little bit more RAM intensive You can't upgrade that. Now, I understand they had to do this to create the price structure that they wanted but I'm just not a fan of that base configuration in terms of USB ports We're looking at a single USB-A and no USB-C ports and the thought process behind that is that right now their Target demographic Of students is a predominantly USB-A market so thumb drives, external hard drives, mice they're just all type-a and I understand that, but this is a device that's supposed to last multiple years, so You won't be upgrading this thing or you won't even think about upgrading the same for like two three Maybe five years and in that amount of time, USB-C will be everywhere Why not give it to them now so that people have access to universal charging? To universal display output? It's so weird that they're using USB-A and they even had USB-C ports on prototypes. We were so close Okay, next up is pricing even the base surface laptop isn't meant for high school or grade school kids It's meant for University students and up and when I'm looking at pricing that base model feels a little expensive and I understand there's a premium with the Awesome build quality, the design, the amazing screen, the material choices and it's very nice-looking But in 2017, you're just not getting good long-term value with four gigs of RAM The mid- and top-tier models seem to be priced well or at least in line with the competitors It's just the base model that I'm concerned about. But one thing to note, if you are students You're able to apply your student discount to these you're going to get about ten percent off So the base model is at nine hundred dollars US. The display panels are awesome with basically 100% sRGB Gamut And they're all individually calibrated at the factory for color accuracy the 3X2 aspect ratio I mean, this is great for tablets because you get a little bit more usable space vertically But on a laptop only device, I would prefer the 16 by 9 screen just for consistency for other devices more importantly though even though the screen supports the surface pen Writing or drawing on a vertical surface like a laptop screen is not an enjoyable experience During the presentation pano's had to hold the screen to annotate on it But I feel like this product wasn't designed around using it with a surface pen. If you want to write or draw Frequently, I would get a Surface Book or a Surface Pro instead So I want to talk about some things that I think Microsoft did right just to kind of close this off They're running PCI-e drives for storage So those are going to be really fast, way faster than the ones on the Surface 3 The CPU selection is good that top end i7 actually has an Iris+ graphics chip I'm really glad they went with that instead of the more common 7500U. The battery looks promising. They're claiming 14 and a half hours running Windows 10s I'm assuming. But the way that I use my computer, it's probably gonna be 10, 11 hours Which is still really long. Overall, I think this is a great product despite having a couple concerns I think Microsoft did a really good job on this thing So I will be doing a full review when I get the unit in If there's stuff that you guys want me to kind of take a look at in particular Let me know I'm going to be spending more time in a comment section of this video Just because I know a lot of you guys are students, and you might have an opinion I'd love to talk to you guys about it. Let me know! Questions, comments I'm going to be down there for quite a bit in this video Hope you guys enjoyed this! Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it. I'll see you guys next time",

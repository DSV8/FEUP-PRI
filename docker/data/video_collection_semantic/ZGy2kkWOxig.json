    "transcript": "Wow, look at the size of this computer. Okay, the NDT from HD Computers isn't quite that big, but it's like nothing I've ever seen before. It's tall, statuesque even, and it is packed with top tier components to the point where you might kind of wonder if they're compensating for something. Regardless of that though, it's a really cool concept for a case layout and they were kind enough to send it over so we can tell you guys, is it a complete hunk of junk or is it the next big paradigm in case design? Maybe both are showed up with kind of a unique feature that gives it some serious room to breathe here. Oh, well, there's your problem right there. They glued on the side panel. When we reached out to customer service, they told us they're using a high grade, specialized structural epoxy from the aerospace industry. And let me just put it this way. I'm not sure that that was the right call. So Dr. Linus is here to fix it up. Glue gun. How'd you know I was gonna ask for a glue gun? I need 20 CCs of hot glue, stat. Oh boy, this is not aerospace adhesive at all. But then again, the aerospace adhesive didn't work very well either. So best of luck, everybody. Oh crap. Okay. Oh boy. Dump extra on, dont peel it off. Another patient saved, all in a day's work. Now all we need to do is fire this puppy up and see if all of these vents can give us enough airflow for our high-end hardware. Is this not the power button? Oh wait, there's the power button. And there's this message from our sponsor, Zoho One. Zoho One brings together sales, marketing, finance, analytics, and support in a single unified platform like some kind of business Voltron, it's amazing. Try Zoho One today for 30 days using the link below. Wait, the script calls for me to show them the internals. Why did I close up the computer if we're gonna show them the internals right away? Now, I just wanna make something clear. This is actually how it showed up, with the side panel no longer adhered to the side of the tower. We reached out for comment and they mentioned how disappointed they were with the adhesive failure, but they reassured us that the computer should still run fine. More on that later. I'm not sure that I entirely agree with them. The RTX 4090, now that the adhesive has come off the side panel, seems to be just hanging here. Anyway, there is this bracket that's, no way. Why even unpack all the levels of fail here? The bracket is screwed on to the graphics card, even if it's only adhered to the side panel, but instead of being made of something with structural rigidity, like steel or even aluminum, it's actually made of acrylic. Acrylic, guys? At least use two-crylics. Also, these screws either weren't screwed in all the way or they are not locked tight and they've come loose. Is this as shipped? This is as shipped. We have done nothing else after the fact, other than to test it with labs. I think the power button was in place, but they moved it because the panel kept falling off. So that's why the power button is, you know, just off to the side there. To their credit, their aerospace adhesive does seem to be better than our hot glue. Aerospace, these are terms that get thrown around a lot, but don't be fooled. They're not particularly meaningful. Velcro is a fastener developed for use in space, but it's just Velcro. I kind of want a Velcro side panel now. You want a Velcro side panel? The all Velcro PC. You do it up like this and it has a pump. All right, here we go. This one kind of just slots in on the one side with fuzzy tape. I guess that'll keep it from rattling at least. And then screws in on the other side. This appears to be the side panel that's actually intended to be removed. Why is that middle section damaged? Ah, that's not damaged. That appears to be welding marks. So rather than having these run the entire span, they're welded here so that they don't rattle all over the place. It's got a very handcrafted feel to it. What are we looking at here? Basically top of the line in terms of spec. It's a 13,900 non-K, probably just so that they can actually cool the bloody thing it's on an ITX motherboard, the RG Strix Z790i gaming wifi. It's got 32 gigs of Kingston DDR5 5600. Apparently that's been updated to 6,000 and they're running a thermal right AXP 120-X67. I guess we'll find out if this is enough for Core i9 and this power supply almost certainly is. That is an 1100 watt SFX power supply. Here's some more handcraftedness. It looks like the housings on these USB connectors had to be shaved down in order to get them to fit under the front panel. That's not inherently a bad thing, but what is, is the fact that this PCIe bracket on this GPU seems to be, oh no, the bracket seems stronger than the case. The bracket seems fine. It's actually the case that's moving around here. I'd be lying if I said I didn't love the concept overall though. I mean, look at it. It's not much thicker than the GPU itself. The footprint is tiny. If you're the kind of person who's got a monitor arm, for example, and wants to save space on your desk, can you 4090 in much less space than that? And it's imposing, really cool. I actually have a lot of hope for cooling too. All of our fans are aligned. So our intake side is all down this side and then they've got these nice wide open vents, both at the front here and then all along the back here that are gonna allow all that hot air to come out in theory. If only my GPU was attached to the computer. Oh, and if only my power button was attached. Now labs took the power button off for some reason. I can't fathom why. Oh, what? No, hey ploof. This power button is still in here. Did it just break? Oh yeah, it kind of looks like they added a new one. Yeah, this is a completely different power button. This seems to just not work anymore. Well, that's probably why. Well, there's your problem. Thank you for that. It probably broke off from here. Although this is cracked too. Well, that might've been for most dropping and I'm not sure. From, no, no, it dropped itself. That's not on us. Yeah, this is a broken power switch. It's hot glued in, which means I can remove it. It just takes a little bit more time. And it does seem to be the exact same style of switch that we have. So YOLO. YOLO. Oh man, this is one of those products that really has a very DIY vibe. Lots of good ideas here though. Check this out, for example. You can get at the screws for the GPU by just sticking your screwdriver through one of these vents, lttstore.com. Did I mention the low back force on the ratchet? Remove the whole thing. Just using the ratchet, amazing. One, two, screws holding in this graphics card. That's what I said now. Okay, there's a lot of glue gumming this up. The LTT screwdriver is neither a chisel nor a pry bar. Linus Media Group and its associated companies take no responsibility for any accidental damage to your screwdriver or personal injury. Ooh, got it. No, no, no, no, no, it's bent. How did the case get bent? Hey, this is probably good enough. Where's my glue gun at? Yeah, that's an aerospace quantity of regular glue. While we're in here, there's a couple more things for us to appreciate though. They're using a PCIe Gen 4 riser, clearly labeled as such. And these look like pretty cool, low profile display port pass-through cables. These may be custom made as well, looking at how they're both slightly different lengths to account for the different display port ports that they're plugged into on the card. These are there so you can have the GPU IO facing down, but still access it at the back. One curious choice though is that they only run two, even though there are three display port connections on this GPU, and they totally had room to put an HDMI cutout here. And instead I get no HDMI at all. Display port can be adapted to HDMI 2.1, but that's like 20 bucks for an adapter, 25 bucks. It's not cheap. And I already spent this computer. We'll talk about that in a bit. You guys wanna know something? What? This isn't at an angle. You see that? Yeah. Okay. I think that might be why the screws aren't done up all the way in this, so that this can be at an angle to sit flat on the side panel. As for why that's at an angle, I can't tell if it's intentional or if this was bent in shipping, but it does seem to be intentional based on how this screw goes in here. Like it seems like it's supposed to kind of sit at an angle. Yes, it's definitely intentional because they got to make room for the riser here. Yep. That's why it sits at an angle. Ah, okay. It's so cool though, but it is really cool. Maybe. We'll talk about performance in a bit here. I don't know how to get this power button working. I can't find exactly the spot where it's supposed to sit. I think we're just gonna have to kind of hope for the best here. All right. See, imagine if you took like four of these and then you put them in a server rack. Imagine if you took an Xbox and you put it in a server rack. Okay, yeah, I've imagined it. Now what? But it's small and you can just like pull them out like slots. Imagine if you took a PS2 Slim and put it in a server rack. As much as we've dunked on these guys for their hot glue, we've given them this feedback and they have expressed an interest in improving this through the use of screws. I'm out of glue, crap. We have lots, we have lots of good ones. So if they can't find a better adhesive, which they won't, please don't try. They're just gonna put screws in this panel. Please do that. Yes, thank you. Okay, go for it. Oh, no, that's so crooked. So crooked. Dude, dude, oh. It's not that bad. What are you talking about? It's so far off. Okay, good enough. Look, you can't even tell from here. Turn it around. Look at this. It's great. Just leave the side panel off. Well, no, we gotta test it. Thermal test, David. No, I am putting this side panel on. Are you gonna put it on straight this time? I'm gonna try. Okay. Okay, please stay on. All this can be yours for just, what was it? $6,000? 5,700. We did some price comparisons. And if you were to pick up a similar machine from the likes of a main gear, you're looking at about $800 less. And if you were to head over to PC part picker, you're looking at about, say, $1,800 less. Don't judge them too harshly though. They're a very small company. And like I said before, they're looking to improve. I would say we've given them a few things that they could work on. It's also very unique. All those other boutique SIs are using like height Y60s and stuff, like standard cases. I'm not saying that costs $1,000 to make the case. Well, I don't know. With how handmade this is, it just might. And you look at how many people don't. I think we can even use the cable ties. Or we could duct tape it around. Last attempt. May I have another novelty-sized glue stick, please? Oh my God, we've used that much glue? Yes. With more glue, I am quite sure that we will win the day. All right, we ready? Oh yeah, that's the right amount of glue. Oh, too far, too far. What if you jam some hot glue gun in the sink? Yeah. Oh my God, cock it up. We're going hot glue. Put it around the base too. Yeah, really, really, you know, let's not let this fall off again. If your case isn't smoking, you must be joking. We just got to hope the 4090 doesn't get hot enough to get the glue to melt. Okay. I think we've succeeded. Test successful. Does the power button work? Oh, you pressed it. No, I didn't. What? It's one of those things where when you plug it in, it just turns on. Oh yeah, look at that. Wow. If that doesn't intimidate your enemies, your Porsche will. It's a penis extension car. I know I own it. Midlife crisis mobile. Halo infinite. Not that my results really matter. We had the lab test this thing ahead of time and the CPU maxed out at around 80 degrees, which even though it's a non-K, actually pretty impressive. I guess that's what a completely fresh supply of air that's basically unrestricted is going to do for you. And our GPU managed to hit absolute max turbo topping out at 68, 69 degrees. Nice. As for loudness, I'm going to give it a little bit more time but man, especially with the fans facing the other side with this solid chunk of aluminum and all that glue caulking that we've got on it. Acoustic glue. Actually does a lot to deaden the sound. How am I only getting 70 FPS? Did this game absolutely crank itself by default? Is that a 4K screen? Yeah, it's a 4K display. Not only is it quiet but the airflow scheme really does seem to work. Getting lots of hot air out the front kind of coming out this way, pulling cool air in the side and blowing a ton more hot air out the back. And actually we're getting rid of a fair bit out the top as well. Just coming off the cooler for this GPU and it even looks like a radiator. Can you even hear this computer? Nope. It's fricking quiet. You know what else is quiet? The segue to our sponsor. Squarespace. You wanna create and share your own content online therefore you want to give Squarespace a try.

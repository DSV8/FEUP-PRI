    "transcript": "- Today, we are checking out the Nothing Phone. This is such an interesting device and I've been so excited to see in person. And I'm so excited. it's here. Let's unbox it. Look at this box, it's also incredibly unique, it's so flat. This to me looks like something that you would get like a chocolate bar in. This doesn't look like something that a phone or some sort of device is in, but surprise, it is. So there's a little arrow right here which I assume we're gonna just pull it. Let's see what's inside. Oh, looks like we have some instructions. Love those. I'll definitely read those later. And we also have a SIM card ejector but this SIM card ejector looks like a pill. Like this would be something that you would see in The Matrix. He's like, \"Do you want the red pill, the blue pill or do you want the Nothing Phone SIM card ejector pill?\" This would probably stab your insides if you swallowed it so I wouldn't recommend that. But this is a super unique SIM card ejector. (gasps) So I have seen videos of this, I've seen photos, I've seen a ton of content but now I'm getting to see it in person. So all of the reviewers have said pretty much the same thing that videos and photos do not do this justice because when you're actually looking at this in person like there's depth that you can actually see. Like you can see inside of this thing. It's really, really, really, really, really cool. It's crazy because this looks like an iPhone. Like if someone said to me and I didn't know any better and I wasn't actually in tech and I just was like on the street walking, going for a walk and someone said, \"Hey, what phone is this?\" I'd be like maybe an iPhone. It has a very iPhone-ish look especially with these dual camera. The front facing camera is over here on the left hand side. And this does already come with a little screen protector, which is very nice. Now the specs of this phone are pretty good but they're definitely not the highest end flagship specs that you would expect to see in something like this. But this phone is really pushing the boundaries as far as design is concerned because they did a lot of really unique things in this to kind of make up for the fact that it isn't the highest end top of the line device. So I guess now the only thing to do is turn it on. Yep. Yep, it is, here we go. The Nothing Phone has dual-sided gorilla glass giving you a view of this unique back of the phone that they're calling the glyph interface. There are around 900 LED lights that have different patterns to indicate different types of notifications, charging progress and you can even use it as a camera fill light. It's made with a hundred percent recycled aluminum and with over 50% of the plastic components coming from bio-based and recycled sources. The phone is running Nothing OS that ensures no blot wear, just a smooth experience with clean design, widgets, font sounds and wallpapers. There's a red LED on the back that will blink when you're recording video, so no recording surprises. There's also no headphone jack but it does have an under display fingerprint sensor, a 4,500 milli amp hour battery, fast charging 50% in 30 minutes and 100% in 70 minutes. It also does have wireless and reverse wireless charging so you can charge a friend's phone if theirs happens to be dead. It is a 6.55 inch old LED 120 Hertz adaptive refresh rate display running Snapdragon 778G + 5G, eight gigs of RAM, 128 gigs of storage. It comes in black and white. It also has an NFT tracker to show them off in five different sizes and you can even track their prices on your home screen with their native NFT gallery. I'm pretty hyped about that, not gonna lie. And also, it won't even be available in the US. So, yeah, I'm sorry. So connecting to wifi, it's getting my phone ready. I already like the way that Nothing integrates their font styles, like it is a very unique look and I think that's pretty cool. (phone beeping) (gasps) Oh my goodness. (phone beeping) Well this, this is so cool. (phone beeping) Oh, wow, okay. So that's my default ring tone. (phone ringing) What the heck is that? You're doing stuff. (phone ringing) So not only are the lights going but like there's also haptic feedback happening. So with each sound on each pulse of the light, like my phone, I can feel it. (phone beeping) This one's called tennis. (phone rings) The sounds are so good. (phone beeping) Okay, this is way cooler than I thought I was gonna be. Who knew that I needed to have a phone with lights on the back that lights up and does weird stuff. Here we go. Video recording light indicator. (gasps) There it is, there it is. Look at that, that's official. Oh my goodness, this is cool. Definitely a nice feature. Let's take a photo. (phone beeps) Oh, I like the sounds, they're so cute. (phone beeps) (phone beeps) (phone beeps) Jake, this is you. Hello? Say hi. (phone beeps) We were super wide. (phone beeps) Let's see how close we can get on macro. Hmm. It's pretty close. (phone beeps) So to use the back glyph lights as a fill, there's a little flash right up here. So you can click that just to turn on the auto flash, which is there. And then this is the glyph fill lights, you can see right up there, it says glyph fill lights and then on the back, (gasps) check that out. So here we are. Oh, this looks really cool. Like this is honestly something like if you took this outside and showed people right now they would be like, \"Uh, is that the future?\" And I would say, yes, this is the future, I'm holding it in my hand. Now we're recording with the fill lights and with our recording light on. So this is pretty awesome, I'm very into this. There's no sneaking around filming with this. Just saying that this looks like an iPhone, yeah of course, but when you put them up next to each other. Like look at this, I mean, it's a great design, so yeah, I freaking get it. Do you see what I see? But the real question is, can your iPhone do this? All right, we're testing out the front facing video. Now this only does shoot in 1080ps so you're obviously not gonna be getting 4K quality from the front facing camera, but it still is nice to have. I'm not sure where to look because, here I'm supposed to look there, that's where the lens is. It's in the bottom left whereas the iPhone it's usually like right here in the middle. Oh, I've almost run into a succulent. Well, thank you guys for watching. I hope you guys enjoyed this quick look at the Nothing Phone. I'm so excited that I got a chance to check this out. Like I've been dying to open up that box and see what this phone looks like in person. It's definitely way cooler than I thought and this design has by far exceeded my expectations. Like the photos and videos, they really don't do it justice. It looks incredible. If you guys are new here, I'm Justine, I cover a ton of tech stuff. Phones, drones, cameras, computers, you name it, it's probably here. If you guys haven't already be sure to subscribe, hit the bell to be notified when I post new videos and of course leave me some comments below. I would love to hear what you guys think of this device. I'll see you in the next video. Bye. (upbeat music)",

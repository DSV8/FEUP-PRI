    "transcript": "- We have a desperate lack of internet, because we are about to host over 200 gamers over at Lab 2 for the WHALE LAN party, and we are stuck with an internet connection that is slower than the one at my freaking house. I mean, okay, fine, it's not that slow, but still, two gigabit down split up between 250 people, that's only like eight megabits per person, that's one megabyte a second. You're not gonna be downloading Warzone if you're on that kinda speed. Fortunately, we have an ace up our sleeves. Oh, it's a big sleeve, big ace. (chuckles) Because today, with the help of Intel, who sponsored today's video and a portion of our WHALE LAN party, along with Supermicro, who sent over this server, Ubiquiti, I guess, gets a shout at Infinite Cables. We are gonna build the ultimate Steam, battle.net, Origin, Windows Update, Epic Games Store, any game you can think of caching server, to give us local high-speed copies of as many games as possible, and we're gonna test this thing with over 200 gamers to see just how hard we can push it, it's gonna be freaking Epic, and Steam, and Good Old Games and battle.net. - [Jake] Damn it, that's not in the script. (ethereal music) (videogame beeps) (energetic upbeat music) - Caching game downloads and updates on your local network is nothing new. The basic principle revolves around DNS or domain name system. So when you go into your browser and you type in any website, let's say lttstore.com, your computer contacts a DNS server, which converts that text-based URL into the numerical IP address of the website that you want to go to, that way your machine knows where to send the request. Now, the caching solution that we're gonna be deploying today sits in between the DNS servers like Google's 8.8.8.8, or Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1, and it will actually redirect those requests to the NGINX web server software that is running on it, NGINX then checks the request against a list of cachable content, in our case, Windows Update, Steam, Origin, battle.net, and basically all the other game stores, and if it matches, it will cache any incoming content from those stores (metal thuds) onto the machine storage, that means that the next time someone wants to download that same thing, say at a LAN party where everyone wants to download the same game at the same time, NGINX will automatically redirect that download to the local cache of the game rather than download it from the internet. Now, for a home gamer with a single system, it's not gonna matter much, as you likely aren't re-downloading the same games very often, but when you've got 200+ systems on a small connection, the benefit is huge. Now, if you're an OG, you'll probably remember the video that we shot deploying a solution like this in our office nearly four years ago, but quite a few things have changed since then, for one, the process of deploying a Steam caching server has gotten a lot easier and a lot more robust. Gone are the days of running a separate docker container for every service that you intend to cache, it is all built into one with a sweet piece of software called LanCache, creative name, and two, this time we actually have 200+ people and their computers at an actual event where we can coordinate a test of our caching server and see what sorts of wild speeds we can push from it. We're getting a little bit ahead of ourselves here though. Why don't we talk a little bit about the hardware? This is the SuperServer SYS-510P-WTR from Supermicro, it's actually a fairly simple and modest one-use server. Up front we've got four 3.5-inch bays which, by default, are configured for SATA drives, but can be upgraded to SAS or NVMe, like you see here, these are gonna be spicy, and then around back. (groans) (television beeps) And then around back, it's equally boring, there's the two full-height and one-half-height PCI Express Gen 4 x16 slots, alongside dual 10-gig networking, management, some USB and dual redundant power supplies. Let's pull one of these boys out. (squeals) Whoa-ha-hoo, those are long, but only 500 watts, that sounds pretty weak these days, but it's actually perfectly reasonable since this system is only designed to house up to a 270-watt CPU, along with the four storage drives up front, there's no GPUs or anything like that, since all we need to run our game caching is a beefy CPU and storage, so it's perfect for our use case. The machine came from the factory at Supermicro with an Intel Xeon Gold 6314U Ice Lake processor, that's a 32-core, 64-thread, 205-watt chip. It's not the beefiest CPU that you could install in this machine by any stretch of the imagination, but it is plenty for what we're trying to do, since the caching process is actually fairly efficient. We also have eight sticks of registered ECC memory, and since Linux, our operating system of choice here, will cache our frequently-accessed files in system memory, our best bet is to cram this system full of as much RAM as possible to take some of the load off of our storage drives. Fortunately, we've got a whopping 256 gigs of 3,200 MT/s, SK Hynix memory, to fill up all of the available slots. The truth is (sighs) our RAM is not really gonna be a major factor for us because we went so flipping overkill on our storage. Originally, our plan was to throw four of Kioxia's ultra badass CM6-R 30-terabyte gen 4 NVMe drives in a software RAID 0, unfortunately we were on a bit of a tight schedule, getting this server here in time for the LAN, in fact, we are shooting this on a Wednesday, the LAN party starts on Friday, and because of the rush, a small oopsie was made on our order, and (clears throat) while the SLEDs say NVMe, the backplane that it's connected to is only plugged in via SATA, so they overnighted some cables, we should have those for the actual event, but in the meantime, we had to get a little bit creative, and we're gonna have to wire up just two of these SSDs for now. - Here, get creative. - Oh, God. Really? This is how we're doing it? - Oh, and here's the other one, it gets better. - Uh. - It's not that bad. - You know? I feel like we had a real role reversal moment here. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, get creative. Here, look, you can take one of the backplane Molexes out there, and then I got a little, a long boy. - Yeah, it works great. - See this? Look at that. It's mint, like from the factory. - What Jake just handed me is a PCI Express x4 to (clears throat) U.2 adapter card, which is fair enough, then we've got this other one, which is a PCIe x4 to mini SAS HD, but the PCIe version of it, that then goes to U.2 and then plugs in with this Molex connector to the power that used to go into the backplane, Jake! - Don't yell at me, yell at Supermicro. - No, I don't wanna yell at Supermicro, they did us a big solid. - Put that in the- - Yeah, doing this for us, so I don't even. Whatever, Supermicro, you're chill, you're chill in my book. Oh God, oh God. - There you go. - No, no, no, it's not in the slot at all. - Oh my God. Well, it's in the spot it needs to be there. Yeah. - There we go. - Yes. - Mission success. - How many LTT people does it take to put in an expansion card? - [Jake] A couple? - Three. two to do it and one to film them. Haha, 'cause we make videos. - A few, yes. - Yes, that's a joke. - [Jake] Oh wait, we gotta put some screws in that first. - You want screws in it, what? - Here, I got some screws. - What? You don't even- - No, no, put some screws in it, seriously. - We don't even need screws. - That's like a $10,000 SSD. - What? - They're 30 terabytes, what do you think- - I thought you, but the script said we were going to use them, so we are using them. - Which one? - The 30-terabyte Kioxia's. - Yeah. - Oh, bloody hell, Jake. (upbeat music) - What? I don't understand. - Well, no, the script said we were going to use them. - We were going to use four- - And it sounded like we were, and then- - And now we're only gonna use two. - We're only gonna use two for the whole LAN? I guess it's fast. - Man, these things read it like seven gigabytes a second. - I mean, that's fair. - That's really, really fast. - Okay. - How much network would we need for that? - And you gotta remember that when you're downloading games, that's a highly sequential activity. Yes, having multiple users hitting them at the same time is going to add some randomness to the requests. - Suck. - But it's still relatively sequential compared to if we were running this as a database server or something like that. (upbeat music) - Just do this for you, it's fine? - Okay. I mean, that is your job. (Jake snorts) (both laugh) - Yes, all right, fair. - We do have one small problem, it's cool that this server has dual onboard 10 gig network cards, that would've been sufficient if we were gonna use it just internally here, but since we've got 200 people hitting it, oh, and since Ubiquiti provided (snaps fingers) an Enterprise XG 24 Network Switch, which happens to have dual 25-gig uplink ports. Well, I think you can see where I'm going with this. No, you can't? It's right here. This is a dual port 25 gigabit Mellanox ConnectX-5 card, which we should be able to link together for a whopping 50 gigabit combined throughput. Whew, that's- - No, really, this thing is just- - Why did you put this in the. (Jake laughs) You know, we should update your job description to do things for me properly. (Jake laughs) - We don't do things properly here, this is Linus Media Group. - No, no, no, we do, we do things properly. I mean, this is gonna work, right? - I mean, hopefully, I haven't tested anything, so. - You haven't? - We already pre-cached three and a half terabytes. - Nice. - But they said we should pre-cache as much as possible, so we're gonna try to pre-cache like 40 terabytes. - I have never used Command strips before. - Okay, so this side's peeled, really? - Yeah. - Okay, well. - I just put holes in my walls like an animal. If we were gonna be deploying this long-term, then it would be better to use a NAS operating system like TrueNAS, but since we are just using it for the event, we're throwing Ubuntu Server 20.04 on it. - You wanna boot it up? - I do. I'm convinced this guy likes tinkering with gaming technology like this, more than actually playing games. - Whoa, whoa. - Let's see if he's any good when we get there. - Dude. - Dude. - You played MW2 with me. - Dude. - I smacked everybody, it's fine. Played a lot of MW2. - No one calls it MW2. - I do. When you have to say it so much, 'cause you play it so much. (upbeat music) - It's not even faster. M-W-two. - MW2. - Modern Warfare 2, it's the same number of syllables- - Yeah, but- - It doesn't even save- - Say it- - Time. - MW2. - Modern Warfare 2. - That takes way longer. - Eh, marginally longer. (Jake laughs) Once the OS is installed and we're SSHD in, it's best practice to install any available updates, then we can go ahead and install docker-io and docker-compose, these are the only prerequisites required by LanCache, the pre-made caching solution that we're gonna be using that comes nicely bundled in a Docker container. Before we download LanCache though, we're gonna wanna set up our SSD RAID 0. DigitalOcean has a really nice tutorial for doing this on Ubuntu Server on their website, so we're just gonna copy past all the commands from there. - Well, let's see if our array imported that I definitely didn't make earlier. It did not. Oh, it did, look. So I've already cached 3.3 terabytes. - Okay. - Of 56. - Ah. - RAID 0 baby. - Do we even have enough of this to, do we even have enough time to fill that? - Maybe here. - With our storage ready and Docker installed, we can run the download commands from lancache.net and add the config, and we're off to the races. Now, editing the config is where things get a little trickier. - Mm, it's not that bad. - Well it's trickier than just copy-pasting. - Yeah, yeah, well. The main things you have to do are set your system IP, this is so LanCache actually knows what IP address you're using, if you don't, I think it actually binds to all the IP addresses and it might still work, but probably just set it anyways. Then you're gonna set your CACHE_ROOT, which is where everything gets stored. - Yeah. - You really wanna put this in the right spot. - Do that. (chuckles) - If you don't put it in the right spot, it's just gonna fill your boot SSD, and you're gonna have a really bad time. - When it gets completely full, your system will probably go super unresponsive, to the point where it will take forever to enter requests- - Oh, man. - And even, I've had that happen before, when you have zero bits of free space on an SSD, it craps itself. - Sometimes you can't even uninstall stuff- - Yeah. - 'Cause you can't write the log file for the uninstall. - It's really bad. - Bad time. - Then you wanna set your cache size as well as your cache index size for the RAM, and what was the ratio? One gig to- - 256 megs per terabyte. - Per terabyte, okay. - So, I set at the equivalent of 60 terabytes, we will need to up that when we add the other drives in. - The last thing you'll wanna do is set your time zone, it's not mission critical, but, yeah, (indistinct). - It's nice for logs. So if you're having issues and your logs are in a different time zone, you're like, \"What the hell's going on?\" We set that to Vancouver, that's where we're at. - Okay. - That's all we gotta do, man. We can just click Start. Systems on our network won't magically start using the cache, they don't even know it exists, right? So we actually have to go on the system and point it to it, and the easiest way to do this, if you're just testing, is to go into the settings and go, enter your IP address, don't put 8.8.8 in there, that could confuse things, just put your LanCache, it will forward everything else. - Unless it doesn't, in which case having a secondary one would- - A lot of the times windows doesn't properly fail over anyways. - Are you serious? I don't know, whatever, fine. - Yeah. So, remember when our internet went down the other day? It's 'cause the Steam cache was offline and the internet was fine, just nobody had DNS resolving, and in the DHCP server, I had 8.8.8 as option two, but they just, Windows sucks, okay? If you're doing this as an actual deployment, you'll want to set that IP address for the DNS server in your router, otherwise, setting it on all the different computers individually is gonna be an absolute nightmare, especially if the IP ever changes, ugh. (upbeat music) Okay. You'd set? We're good? - I'm firing up Steam. Right, Disk Management, yeah. Boop. - [Jake] I put a seven terabyte in here. - [Linus] Oh, whoa, wow. - [Jake] Yeah, you'll have to delete that, it's probably like- - Okay. - A ZFS partition. - Sail, everybody. - [Jake] Yeah, put D, we'll call it Big D. - [Linus] Big D. Pfft. - Why are you in offline mode? - Why is it on offline mode? - You don't have to, when you go to uninstall the game, it'll prompt you. What the hell? - It's confused. - [Jake] Why doesn't it have internet? - What just happened? - What? - What even just happened? - [Jake] We had internet. - We had all the internet. We run outta internet. - Dammit. - Where's my series of tubes? Darn it! - Dammit, Dale. - Yeah, this is sponsored by Intel, we should have an Intel NIC in there when that actually works. - If we used the Intel NIC it would probably be fine. - We should just go get one, this is not working. - Oh, it's so cute. - Hey Jake, have you seen? Oh, ah, you spoiled it. - What? - Well, I was trying to ask you on camera. - This I have seen. - You've seen what Logistics did to all of our Intel NICs? - Yeah, I, like- - Look at this adorable little (indistinct) fins on them. - Daunted them, I sort of instructed them a little bit on it. - I love it. - Okay, let's just leave it, we have to install drivers, come on, let's go. Steam, Steam, screen record. - Oh God. - Ugh. - [Linus] Here we go, this computer. gotta get my- - You don't need to do it, just click Install. - No. - Click Install. - I won't, I'll have to add one. - Why? This is a nice UI - [Linus] Oh, really? I hate it - [Jake] I mean, it's looks pretty, I don't know if it actually is functional. - Yeah, the other one was simpler. - [Jake] Wow, you totally could have just done this. - [Linus] No, I couldn't have, it wouldn't have been here. - [Jake] Yes it would, it would say, \"Do you wanna install a new library?\" - [Linus] I don't believe you. - Okay, go. See, look, quick, it's gonna go too fast and you're gonna miss it. - Hold on, where is it? Where is it? That's not that fast. - Yeah, that's not that fast. - This is like 8 gig. - Oh, did you remove the DNS? - No. - I think you might have. - [Linus] No, it's there. - [Jake] It's not using it. - No, that's, yeah, it's configured properly. - Okay. - Just remove it and then add it again. Ipconfig//dns, no. - Oh. - or //dn, nope. Flush. What? Are you drunk? - What are you doing? - You have to put a space, buddy. Flushdns - Oh! - Just one word. There you go. - You said, \"slash, slash.\" - No, I said slash. - I was like, \"What is slash, slash?\" - No, I said forward slash. - No, you said, \"slash, slash.\" - Whatever, anyway. - In the record it'll show. - Okay, okay, let the record show that I need to leave. - What is he talking about? - Go to Steam, dammit. (laughs) Oh my God. - Oh, yeah, no connection. - Oh my God! - Plug into the Intel card! - You don't even have drivers, what differences does it make? - Well, I can get them. I can't even. You're plugged into the Intel card, I can't get drivers. - No, I am so- - How am I supposed to get drivers- - Try this- - Smart guy? - 2.5 gig. Man, this is plugged into 10 gig, why don't we just go to my computer upstairs, which is also plugged into 10 gig? - That is legitimately an option. - If this doesn't work immediately, that's where we're going. - Okay, fine. I'm glad this is gonna be such a pain-free experience for the LAN attendees. - Oh, it will be. - Oh, there. - See, like. - Hello. - The CPU and the system is like, \"Oh my God. - Yeah, we had 12,900 Ks downstairs, which is what we really wanted to use 'cause that thing is fast. - Look, my SSD is just 960 PRO, is just at 100%. (laughs) This is as fast. Look, it's writing at 1.2 gigs a second. - It's working. - Something to consider is that not every game is set up exactly the same in terms of the way that the files are compressed, so some of them are more CPU-heavy, some are less CPU-heavy. Counter-Strike Global Offensive might not be the best benchmark, but we are getting 200 and 230 megabytes a second right now? - [Jake] Oh, I do have a way to demo this that's more better. - Oh. - So the Steam cache pre-filling thing just downloads to RAM and then just deletes it, right? 'Cause you don't wanna download the things you're pre-filling, right? That doesn't make any sense. - No one at the LAN is gonna need to go any faster than that anyway, because they're gonna have two and a half gig max to each station, right? - No, a gig only. - Only gig? - Yeah. - Oh, well then pfft. (chill music) - Here, let's try Black Ops I, this one is historically pretty good download. There, 3.4, 4.5, 5.3 gigabit. Whew, 5.4. - Now we just have to see how it scales to 200 people. - Seven. It's pretty much done, six gigs. - Well, no, the data is downloaded. - It's just- - Like what it's doing right now is probably just unpacking it, 'cause it's like, \"Yeah, we would've done that on the fly, but you downloaded me too fast. (Jake chuckles) Way to go, hot shot.\" (Jake laughs) Your goal then is to start this. - No. - And then you're ready to go? - I just need to select one game and then it will already be cached. - Oh, cool. - ARK: Survival Evolved. Enter. Look, it's already gonna be cached, this is gonna download at 10 gig, like, on the dot. - You think so? - Yeah. Look, nine point. There you go, the cache- - Wow. . Because this is already cached and this is just downloading to RAM. There you go, nine gig. (chill music) And the CPU is at, what? 18% only. - Pfft, whatever. This thing's gonna be able to do, like- - Probably 30? - Yeah. - Maybe 40. - That's outstanding. - Yeah. - Some stuff went down, the setup here is absolutely wild, but we're finally ready for the big test, check this out. We had to build a router, okay? The router was only one-gig capable, we have a two gigabit connection, so this is just made of another server. Got our surveillance set up, got our main switches here, and this is it, the Steam cache Clayton server. We're ready for the big moment. Okay, so we've got 150 people who ended up coming to the LAN, and we need them all to go right now. One, two, three. (upbeat music) (server buzzing) Whoa! That is a lot more than the two-gig internet connection we've got, freaking awesome, this thing absolutely saved our bacon, and the most wild part is that the CPU usage is not even that high. I'm pretty surprised at how easily this handled this, even with just a couple of NVMe drives, it's barely even working at it. Freaking love this. - [Jake] 261 megabytes per second. - Wow. - There goes mine. Get over here. - [Linus] Okay, the speed though, thanks, buddy. (participants chatter) Thanks, Intel, for sponsoring this video, and thanks for providing the Steam cache, it absolutely saved the day, everyone was able to download games. I mean, I was downloading games at 2.5 gig basically the whole time 'cause I brought myself a little USBC 2.5 gig network adapter, but everyone else was probably at one gig for the most part, absolutely no hiccups at all. If you guys enjoyed this video, you can check out a classic, where we built ourselves a pfSense box way back in the day, but one that was designed for gigabit internet, not two gigabit internet. (upbeat music) It's a while ago, but the principles are still pretty much the same. (upbeat music)",

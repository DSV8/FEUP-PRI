    "description": "In this episode of The Future of Music presented by Aloft Hotels, we talk with Charli XCX, who has found mainstream success by releasing steady drip of singles on streaming platforms. And it works. With the rise of streaming, the way artists can release music is changing. Over half of people now listen to playlists instead of albums, and attention spans are shorter than ever. Streaming favors constant content and the traditional build up to a big album drop is becoming a relic of the past.

    "transcript": "(electronic music) - I was never intentionally really thinking about, I wanna break the system. Like I just, for me it's just like, I was feeling very creative and wanted to release my music rapidly and when I wanted. Without streaming it would be so difficult to be able to do that. - [Female Narrator] We all know streaming is changing the way we listen to music but it's also changing how artists release music. Charli XCX is a singer and songwriter, known for hits like Boom Clap, (\"Boom, clap\"). Boys, (\"I was busy dreaming about boys\".) and \"1999\" with Troye Sivan. (\"I just wanna go back, back to 1999\"). She's known to release music however and whenever she wants. Often with little warning. Which would've been unthinkable before streaming. Now artist can instantly put their music online but this also means they have to find ways to stand out among the millions of songs at our fingertips. As a result, the idea of what an album is has completely changed. (upbeat music) - I wanna release music when I feel like it and how I want to. And I find that particularly major labels, who have like a very like strict structure of how they want artist to release music. That just doesn't really work for me. And I don't think, especially now, it doesn't really work for my fans. - What do you mean by that? - Well, I think fans are hungry for content and for music from their favorite artists. And there's so much out there at the moment, you know? They can get whatever they want all the time. So it's very, everything's very like rapidly digested and people want more. So, yeah everything moves so much quicker now. - But first, let's take a step back. Technology has always dictated how artist release music. The flat record was commercialized in the 1890's and for decades, singles were popular because early kinds of records could only hold about three minutes of audio. Around the 1950's, the LP was introduced Which could hold up to 52 minutes of audio and the album, as we know it was born. The traditional album lasted for decades, continuing with the cassette and then the CD, all the way until the 2000's, when digital services like iTunes popped up. This let people pick and choose what songs they wanted to buy from albums, ushering the singles market back. Now, with the rise of streaming services, how artists release music, whether it's singles, mixed tapes, or albums, has dramatically changed once again. (relaxed music) - Traditional album cycle is, you put out a single, maybe a second single, if you're crazy you'll put a third single out before an album comes out. As a way of sort of teasing the larger product that is to arrive. - What are you seeing now that's different from that? - I think the best way of putting it would be that sort of waterfall method, where artist are putting out single, single, more singles, and maybe a single every month, that maybe would lead into an EP or an album and sometimes it will take years. - And this waterfall strategy is used by tons of big artists like The Chain Smokers, Bebe Rexha and Billie Eilish. - I've heard that term for like three or four years now and its like whenever I go to a meeting with my label and they'd be like, yeah you know we've been thinking about this new strategy its called the waterfall strategy. You drop one song and then three months later you drop another one and then three months later you drop another one and that's the waterfall. I'm like wow okay, every body got paid today great. (laughing) Like its just, its just, that's just dropping songs. - What is the difference to you between a mix tape and an album? - Literally nothing (laughing) the ones recently that I did like \"Number 1 Angel\" and \"Pop 2\" I called them mixed tapes because then my label felt more relaxed about them. Because I think for a major label, we're making an album, then we're putting it out there's expectations like we want it to hit this, this, this like blah, blah, blah whatever. And so like for me the mix tape thing like, I just wanted to like bang bang like two albums in one year, like lets go. - [Zane Lowe] Artists are putting out more and more individual songs because you can. You don't have to wait around anymore, get into a cue, wait for a record label or some company to tell you its your turn up to bat. I think you're seeing younger artists coming up who were raised in a free space using things like Sound Cloud to a degree, watching iTunes democratize the release of songs and now looking at streaming services and go well, I can fill this with as much or as little music as I want and I just want to be creative all the time. I don't necessarily want to wait. - [Female Narrator] Charli has a new album and in the five months leading up to it released the four stand alone singles; \"Flash Pose\", \"XXXTC\", \"Spicy\" and \"Dream Glow\". As well as six songs from the album including the hit \"Blame It On Your Love\". Which roughly breaks down to a single every twelve days. (techno music) - I think streaming really lends itself to artists being artists, streaming is determined by the user right the person using the platform so they can click on Billie Eilish and stream her as much as possible and they can also like go to her Instagram account and like work out pretty quickly that she's like a very unique and cool person and its driven by like the kids and the people who are listening to her music. Which I think is really good for pop music and for culture because its not like a bunch of like white males at radio stations and record labels deciding like what the general public should listen too. - The boundary between can people get my work could not be lower right? Its at the lowest point in history. We could make a track right now and we could go put it on the internet we could get it on Spotify almost immediately, that's not the problem, the problem is how do you get peoples attention once its out there? How am I going to be noticed in that crowd of music that's being released every single Friday? There's like this tension between the business of music and the artistry of music. There's I think also a lot of people crying wolf of like music is over because of this new streaming economy, songs are only going to be one minute and twenty five seconds long, they're not going to be meaningful. But the thing about attention is that people get bored of fads, they get get bored of things that are just pure tricks. You ultimately have to grab someones attention and sustain it. - How do you think streaming has changed the way people write music? - Oh extensively. I've heard from multiple song writers that they are actually thinking about the song structure differently because of how they are going to get paid via song streaming. (upbeat music) - [Female Narrator] Which means, streaming isn't just changing the album, its changing songs. - [Charlie] Like if its not for me and if I'm writing like a song that is for another big pop artist, that's where I get really into my commercial zone. So I want to play all the games and I want this song to be huge, be the perfect little package that will make it as most maximally appealing to every body. - So what are some of those tricks that you use to make sure that the skip rate is as low as possible? - Like chords within the first thirty seconds, no like weird like self indulgent intro which basically are on all the songs I put on my album. Hook at the top, in the intro, maybe even start with the chorus. I think that radio songs should be like two minutes twenty, like get in and get out like everybody just get on with your life. - So you just try to front load as many of the catchy bits as possible? - I think so. The formula and tricks I think are used and paid attention too so much in the streaming climate because its all about like making sure the person doesn't change the song. Now its like all about like did you like grab them in that first five seconds. - Do you think that what you're doing represents more what people will be doing in the future? - I kind of think its the norm now, I mean like Ariana Grande is one of the most huge artists in the world and to me it at least it felt like she is like doing what she wants. She just like put out an album and then like straight away dropped like \"Thank You, Next\" and I think that's happening a lot more now. I think the new landscape really like lends itself to artists who are unique and have a different language and a very specific vision in that sense I think streaming is good because it just opens everything up and every thing becomes much more cross pollinated and there's for so many you know genres and its not about radio which is great and so I think that's a good thing, I think that's great. (electronic music) - [Female Narrator] Thanks for watching this video is brought to you by \"Loft Hotels\" different by design. For more videos like this, like and subscribe. Before we talk about anything else, one thing that I'm dying to know about is why you call yourself Charlie XCX. - It was just my MSN screen name when I was younger and then I would just make MP3's and put them on MySpace and I didn't have a stage name so I just panicked and used my MSN screen name and - [Woman With Pink Hair] The rest is history. - The rest is history yeah. - God you're such a child of the internet. - Yeah (laughing) - An MSN screen name and then putting it up on MySpace.",

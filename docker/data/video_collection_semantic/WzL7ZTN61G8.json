    "transcript": "Facebook stories Ray-Ban glasses - A Facebook whistleblower is testifying for a senate committee. I'm currently reading \"An Ugly Truth\", an expos about Facebook and all their crappy practices over the past decade, and look what's here. Do you want a camera on your face from one of the most data-hungry and malicious companies in the world or at least negligent? I don't, but it comes in a big box. (cover thumps) Boom. Ray-Ban stories integrates Facebook technology with iconic Ray-Ban eyewear to bring you the new way to capture, share, and listen. Cool. - [David] Wow. - And now the actual product box that consumers will get. (grunts) So much waste in the world, you know. These magnets here just for no reason. A cylindrical prism, Wayfarer, Ray-Ban stories, there's actually two styles, I kind of prefer the other type, which is the more like club round looking one. I actually own those sunglasses. I would have liked to have those, but Wayfarers are safe. They look good on everybody. These look good on me, too, but you know, it's riskier to get the rounds. So Ray-Ban, Facebook, a normal looking case. Download the Facebook View app. There's a new Facebook app that wants to live on your phone. And a charging cable, USB-C to shining sea, that's about two and a half feet long. Oh, oh cool, I didn't know it came with a, aw, I thought this was a string for the glasses so you can wear them voting or something. It's actually just a little soft bag. But you know what I always say, \"On your face or in the case.\" This was not gonna save you from sitting on them. And then there is a little warranty bag. Oop, see you later. Oh, wait, one more thing. The hitchhiker's guide to the sunglasses wearable galaxy. Now, the glasses themselves, this case is a little heavier than normal. There's a light on it, hold on. It was just glowing, amber. Yeah, it's a charge case. Cool, it's got this kind of foamy, this is not Alcantara, this is like a foamy kind of innered padding and there's the glasses. And you can see they sit in here and it's actually a magnetic charging case. There's some contacts right there. And that is so cool, that these just go into a normal seeming case and you can't screw that up. They just kind of have to be on the charger when they're in there. This is a little bulky, USB-C charger on the back. They are quite low profile. Yes, these arms are thicker than normal, but they don't look obviously fat. Like these look pretty good, these are light. I will say that, I believe these were $300 (groans) and which is what, double the price of Wayfarer's? And they don't feel or look as nice as a regular pair of sunglasses. There's no metal on here. They're all plastic. They kind of look like what you get in a case of beer. There's no ability to articulate the nose piece. And I mean, not all sunglasses have that, but my Ray-Bans do. Ooh, kinda squishy. How you doing Frank? I don't know why I always say that. It's from \"Empire of the Sun\". (laughs) Young Christian Bale says it. The camera's on the front. You can see them there, they're on either side. I think the ones on the snap spectacles are larger and are like very obvious. These are kind of in that uncanny valley where they're so small that you might not notice them, but not small enough that no one will notice them, which kind of puts you in the whole like \"I've been talking to you for 10 minutes and now I noticed that you have cameras on your glasses and now I'm creeped out.\" So don't know with that. Now they do have a light that accompanies any photo or video that you take. It's a white light, we'll see that in a moment. And we'll see if that is sufficient to not creep people out. I'm also seeing a little hold or toggle here. There's a switch it's showing red right now, like it's maybe off. That's gotta be the power, I'm assuming, but why don't I start by opening up the app, and I think you can get these without any tint. - [David] Oh, just like glasses? - Yeah, just like clear frame, but I don't know what the point of that would be. Let's get your glasses paired enough to date. So you can capture moment, listen to media. You can use these as headphones and share memories with those who matter most, like the people on my Facebook are the ones who matter most. There's a lot of people on there who are just, honestly, I didn't know they were on there until it was their birthday, and now I have to delete them. Start by turning on your glasses. Slide and hold the power switch toward the lens until the notification LED starts. I want that green light to blink. All right, it's blinking blue. RB, Ray-Ban stories, there they are connecting. Allow access to your contacts and call history. (sighs loudly) I mean, Facebook probably already has all this, but no. Imagine this just goes like \"New Guy\" on me. I suddenly have this awesome HUD, but no, despite Facebook owning Oculus, these are not AR glasses. I'm not gonna have any cool overlays. I feel like I should disclose that that's what I want. Maybe if I think about this long enough and I get scared enough, I won't want this, but generally speaking, I want there to be a brain machine interface future, where we just are integrated with machines, and I think that wearables with AR are a stepping stone to that. These are not that. I want them to be, but they're not. These are just a way for me to like, just make more Facebook stories. So Facebook needs location access to connect your glasses' temporary wifi network for large file transfers. This is used to import, captures, and update your glasses. It needs it, dammit. Look at this, capture the moment hands-free. Use Facebook assistant to take photos and videos with your voice. Hey, Facebook, take a video. I'll have to set it up. It's not gonna do that. Okay, so you don't need to use the voice. You could just go like this. I don't know what it's doing, but it went du-du-du. You guys can't hear this, but I'm getting all sorts of little like, budoops. I'm gonna use the Hey Facebook thing 'cause I have a hunch that the person that this product is actually for is a hands-free person, because I'm guessing that the video and picture quality is gonna be worse than your phone. And so this is really about not having to take out your phone and I'm probably riding my bicycle or something like that. I think I would want the voice. Press and hold to take a photo. The white notification LED will blink and make a sound during the capture. But first, thanks to Vessi Footwear for sponsoring this video. Vessi shoes are known for being lightweight, easy to pack, comfortable, and most importantly, waterproof. Designed to keep you moving, Vessi just released their Everyday Move shoes. And I got to say, these are the best looking Vessis I've seen and they're my second pair, pretty cool. With enhanced breathability and added support, this style is perfect for the adventurous or those looking for a sportier look. Featuring a pull tab to take them off, put them on with ease, vegan suede, lace cages, extra mid-sole cushioning, and the same waterproof Diamond-Tex technology. You'll want to wear them everywhere. So get $25 off and keep your feet dry this winter by using our code shortcircuit Vessi.com/ShortCircuit. (camera clicks) Okay, it did it. The sounds are awesome. (camera clicks) Record a video is actually just the single press, not the hold, and it will record a... (audio plays) Oh, what the hell? Elon Musk is talking to me. This isn't a joke. I was listening to an interview with Kara Swisher and Elon Musk and on my way in here and it just started playing. (laughs) So bizarre. I wonder why it did that. Did I hit the touch pad? Oh, I did. (audio plays) Play and pause. Now, is this bone conduction or... No, there's actually speakers, they're right here. Can you see that? It's pretty clear. And it's cool, there's nothing in my ears at all. And if, especially if I'm riding a bike or on a skateboard or something like that, I can hear everything around me. So good use case for that. We will try music in a bit. Tap once to play audio, double tap to skip forward, triple tap to go back, that's very nice. I wonder if I can swipe for volume, that would be cool. Adjust volume swipe forward to turn up the volume, back to turn down, yes. This light will go orange when the battery is low. Now, what the heck was I doing? I'm just trying to take a picture or a video. (beeps) So it does a single tone, like beep but I have no idea. Okay, the light up here, I do have an idea. This light on the inside is on. Okay, so is it gonna just only do 30 seconds, no more, no less? - I don't know. - Can I stop it? I can stop it. Now Quentin Tarantino is talking to me. God, all these deplorables. (laughs) Okay, so let me show you a test here. I have paused the podcast. Now I'm gonna try to record a video, and when I stop that video, I don't want the podcast to be playing. I want to know if just by hitting record button, I'm easily inadvertently playing the podcast. That's recording. Stop recording. No podcast, we did it. I was being very careful. This button kind of sucks. It's not very tactile, it's kind of mushy, and it's easy to feel like I'm only rocking the side of it and not the whole thing. I will say that the internal light, the notification LED, is really outside of your vision. You kind of have to look up to see it, which is pretty cool. It's not like, it's not annoying. You have to glance at it. Hey Facebook. (beeps) (laughs) - That was a fun noise. - Buwee. Hey, Facebook, take a photo. (camera clicks) Cool, and I could see the internal LED blink a bit when it's about to take that. That's kind of cool. It takes a few seconds. And I wonder if that's for a creep factor or maybe it's a limitation of the technology, but it seems like it would be hard to like capture a quick shot of someone's pee pee at the urinal or something like that. 'Cause it does take, okay, let's say your pee pee's over here, and I'm like, \"Yeah.\" (camera clicks) That's about as fast I can do, and that's okay. Now, let's say I'm gonna start taking a picture now and move over (camera clicks) pretty quick. But let's see in our app, if there's like a lot of motion blur or something, maybe that didn't work at all. Lets Facebook View import new captures for you. Background location... Allow all the time. I am not digging the location requirements of this product, man. Oh, I guess I had 13 images on the device and now I'm downloading, I'm importing them. So you can do that, you can do that if you don't want to share a location. Like why do they even have to get imported into this? The snapshots, the spectacles from Snap, I believe you just take a capture and it goes directly to your account, like you can share it from the glasses. Isn't that what a power user wants to do? Isn't that who is gonna buy this? Why wouldn't I be able to just share this directly to Instagram or Facebook? It doesn't make any sense. Now let's see the quality of what we've captured. Okay, the app crashed. Let's try again. It crashed again. Let's try opening a different photo. (David laughs) I also can't tell from this interface, which of these are photos and which of these are videos. Oh, wait, looks like it's importing again. I'm hearing ocean noises in here, too. Now I can see timestamps on the videos. Okay, they're all done. It appears that my pervert test went well (David laughs) and it was easy to take photos with no motion blur. Now, what about videos? It was already recording. (camera clicks) The photo's in here. It looks like, I don't know, a photo from like a Pixel 1, 2 or something. I can adjust the brightne SS, the sharpen, the saturatio N, and the warmth, I can enhance. Wow, I actually did a pretty good job enhancing that. That's way warmer, and I can crop. If I were trying to export this directly to a story on Facebook or Instagram, you'd think that it was gonna be portrait. I can save this to my phone and I can share. But what happens if I go to Facebook your story? Yeah, so it basically, treats it like any other content when I'm sharing it to Facebook. It doesn't really seem to know that this content came from their own product. It's really, anyone could have made this it seems. Shall we make a phone call then? - [David] Sure. - Hi, Dennis. I'm just calling you using my Facebook sunglasses. - [Dennis] Oh my God, I want that. - You want them? - You got it, you got it? That's so cool. - Why do you want them? - Just to creep around. - To creep around. (David laughs) Okay, wow, you know what? I think I feel you, I'm into it, too. I want to take these home this weekend. (David laughs) - You sound good really good, like very clear. - I sound good? You sound pretty good, too. Calls are pretty good. I think the only last thing I want to try is music. You know what, I'm gonna give it its best shot possible. I'm gonna listen to some master tracks from TIDAL, TIDAL HiFi. (David laughs) Is it coming on my phone? Yeah, it's coming out my phone. Why? What about this? Okay, this podcast is coming through here, but TIDAL wasn't, why? Okay, let me try YouTube music. (audio playing) That was coming out of the phone. Trying to get my mind around this. Well, what would it do with YouTube then? - Boy, if I got a fun project for you guys... - Phone. what if I use Spotify, which is everything? Check out \"They're Just Movies\". That's coming through. That'll work with your Facebook glasses so will our new James Bond review, I'm sure. Well, what happens if I play music through Spotify? It's in there. - What the heck? - What is this? That sounded bad, I'm out of here. No offense, \"Youngblood\" fans. I don't know guys, hit or miss? Calls worked at least, podcasts seem to work. Is Spotify a podcast app and that's why it works? I don't understand them. (audio playing) Whoa. That is a brutal song, I don't, I'm sorry, but it's weird that I can control the music with the glasses, but the music is not coming through the glasses. Maybe this is a bug and it'll get worked out, but right now this is broke. You're meant to get three charges, (groans) three charges out of the charge case. They're meant to last like six hours, but I think if you've used them quite a bit or do a long call, you're not gonna get close to that. Overall, I think they kind of look cheap. They are not cheap, but at least they look like glasses. They don't look like Google glass. They look like glasses, so they're good for that. They could be used useful for select cases like people who are maybe doing sports, biking, skateboarding, snowboarding, but for general people, I don't think you're gonna buy them. And I don't think you're meant to buy them. Honestly, I think Facebook did this as an experiment to build the products they want to build in the future. Can we partner with the existing Industrial design company? Can we scale up? Can we make an app for it? Like they just wanted to get their feet wet. And at the end of that, they said, \"Oh, we might as well sell the few hundred thousand that we make.\" So good luck to you, Facebook. I hope your future products are cooler. And I also hope that they come from a business division that is broken up from your core business. Regulate Facebook, delete Facebook, kiss Zuckerberg for his philanthropy. That is all, bye-bye.

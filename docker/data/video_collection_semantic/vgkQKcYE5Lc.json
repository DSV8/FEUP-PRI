    "transcript": "I am clearly getting old to the point where I'm worried that soon my grandkids are excitedly going to dump me in an old age home where they'll drug me and feed me soft food every meal and the reason for that is because my gamer wrists are getting pretty unhappy with extended gaming sessions involving frantic clicking in fact it's not just gaming sessions editing these videos also get the the carple dogs are Barkin which led me on a bit of a mouse Journey which I found interesting enough to share with you ooh but first today's video sponsor while building an RGB gaming system you ever find yourself in this position well corsair's new IQ link McGuffin can help being able to daisy chain all of your RGB and fans together with a single cable run makes life so much easier I recently swapped a bunch of IQ link fans into a test system and had a great time not getting tangled in RGB fans like King Kong in a substation who look at those trouser tightening results so if you want a greatl looking easytouse premium RGB solution check out IQ link using the link in the video [Music] description now my mouse Journey started when I realized that two of my family members own this mouse which is the Logitech MX Master 3s and as far as I know it's widely considered as one of the best productivity mice and interacting with it I was intrigued enough to go out and buy my own one and um it's fine it's what I'd call a high-end example of mouse it feels wellmade it's comfortable and it does Mouse things well but nothing about using it got me aroused in any way having said that I do like this very well dampened side scroll wheel which is kind of fun to use in Photoshop now what I don't love about it which may be a bit of a lame gripe but the main scroll wheel as you can hear here is not clicky it's like a free flowing thing which to me the scrolling speed in Windows doesn't quite respond intuitively to the varying velocity of your inputs giving the mouse a bit of a learning curve which would be fine if it's your only Mouse but if you switch between between mice quite regularly like I do every time I get back to it I have to get used to the scroll wheel feel again which does feel a bit lame to complain about but I wish it had that option where you could like select a clicky mode for it that would be awesome like the old Prometheus I think stupid complaint aside there was one part of the mouse that got me quite intrigued if you look at the back of it it has quite a scrumptious booty which fills your palm quite nicely and angles your forearm slight off the table now if you talk to like ergonomics people according to them having your forearms straight down onto the table is really bad for things like carpal tunnel cuz you have to like stretch tendons and stuff to get into that position so lifting your arm up a little bit does relieve some of that tension the problem for me with this MX Master though is that it doesn't quite lift your arm enough so I got to Googling and found something else so out with the MX master and in with this mouse which is the Lodi lift it's a very oddl looking device but aside from some issues I have with it which we'll address in a second this is by far the most comfortable Mouse I've ever used at least once you get used to the shape look at it your forearm is so much more up while holding it and it's it's really comfortable I can spend an entire day editing with this thing with without having the carpo hounds uh barken now my issues with it the first one is that it uses like doublea batteries so it's not rechargeable but the batteries do seem to last quite long uh another problem with it is that the click buttons are really terrible like they're nice and quiet but they're like a damp handshake and the other thing is as you can tell from the complete lack of RGB on this mouse it is very much not a gaming mouse I did try and use it for gaming a little bit and it just felt very awkward uh it was difficult for me to like accurately click on things quickly but that's very anecdotal so I decided to try and find a way to get a little bit more empirical data on how much worse this is to game with than an actual ergonomically terrible normal gaming mouse now I've decided to get some empirical data on the difference between a normal gaming mouse like this disgusting M65 I've been using for a very long time and the weird ergonomic one by using aim Labs now I am by no means like Ali from Optimum Tech who was endowed by the gaming Gods with insane ability in fact I've never even done aim Labs before so I don't think this is going to go great but I'm curious to see if there's like a measurable difference in my performance between the two mice and I'm going to start off with the gross M65 and I have to admit my first aim Labs experience was much more harrowing than expected when will this end 20 20 more seconds I feel like my eyes are going to explode oh there we go so I have an accuracy of 95.2% on the little M65 with a reaction time of 378 milliseconds I don't know if that's good but it doesn't it doesn't sound very good but with a DPI of 400 on the Corsair mouse that is what what my score looks like it then took me a while to match the DPI of the M65 with the Lodi lift because the logi lift doesn't let you set the DPI just like the mouse pointer speed I guess but once I got them feeling similar I was ready to destroy some balloons and the result of the slaughter was surprising so my accuracy was a little bit higher with the little lift thing uh but my score was was slightly lower oh yeah my reaction time was quite a bit lower on the mouse though because I feel like it's quite hard to get it to line up and after one more test per Mouse a clear theme was emerging I am measurably less accurate with the the gaming mouse than I am with the lift like that is those are consistent results although with the gaming mouse it's a little bit faster you can see that I'm I've actually gotten a higher score there before doing some more aim Labs I fired up a game of DOTA switching between the two mice to see which I preferred and by the end of the match I kept going back to the lift cuz it was just so much more comfortable over the next couple of days I was in AIM Labs mode testing a couple of gaming mice against the lift and two things quickly became clear one if anything I was getting worse at aim labs and two I was consistently more accurate with the lift but slower and after a bunch of aim Labs I felt like a big reason for the geriatric scores on the lift was because its feet provided too much resistance on the mouse pad the lift feels real grippy compared to its gaming counterparts so I decided to do a small mod to the lift to try and bridge that Gap and speed I decided to get some fancy new superglide footies for the vertical Mouse to see if it increases my speed at [Music] all oh they're so tiny so I think I'm going to stick them on the existing feet I'm not sure does this look like something that isn't really stupid I mean maybe it feels a little bit better but as is usually the case I immediately ran into a problem the current footy position lifted the sensor too high off the table for it to reliably read movement so I had to change the position to this well it it does actually feel very different I'm curious to see what the aim lab results are going to be like and after just a minute of eyeball torture the first result was in whoa okay so I have lost a bit of accuracy but look at my score although moving back over to the M65 did show that maybe I was having a good day okay so we do have that accuracy difference between the two mice but the scores are closer now and the wrist pain difference is very big but when I move moved back over to the lift I was surprised at how confidence inspiring that Mouse had become in AIM Labs oh the feet made a big difference actually so with the glass feet applied Not only was I still more accurate with the lift now I was also faster with it than the gaming mouse now don't get me wrong it took quite a bit of getting used to but I'm really starting to warm to the idea of a vertical gaming mouse maybe if Logitech releases a lightweight version of the lift with a hero sensor in it and a rechargeable battery it could be a god tier gaming peripheral with that let me know in the comments down below what experience you've had with vertical mice and if you think this is a cocki idea subscribe and until the next video [Music] bye-bye",

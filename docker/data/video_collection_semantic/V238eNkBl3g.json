    "transcript": "- What are we doing? - [Jono] Unboxing. One million subscriber special, Linus. - A million subscriber special, you say. All right, well, let's just open this with my trusted unboxing knife. (knife thuds) (soft music) - [Jono] The one million subscriber special. - How do you unbox that? (Both laughing) - Oh, geez. - Okay. - [Jono] Now, open it. - What is the, ah? (Jono laughs) - Am I opening this with a pen? - [Jono] Yes. - Oh geez, I should have brought a knife. Do you have a knife? - [Jono] Yes. - What the crap is this? - What is this? - It's a compass! - Oh yeah, yeah, I remember these things from like school. Although I didn't do that well in school, but here I am. I don't need your thing. - People who watch me know I never have a knife. (grunts) (box thuds) - Oh, I broke the box, I'm sorry. (ethereal music) - Hey, what do we got here? - What are these? Are these, oh no. (Jono laughs) - [Jono] They're comments, Colton. From all the videos. - And let me guess, you picked them. - [Jono] Yes. - Oh, so these are all like top comments. Oh, that's fun. - No one told you that you can print directly on cue cards? Look at this. - [Jack] Ah, whatever. Jack (laughs). - One million subscribers? I didn't even react when you said that Jono. Yay! Yes (growling), yes! - Linus: I'm gonna retire. Also, Linus: we have a new channel, lol. I did do that, didn't I? - James was born to do unboxing videos, he brings a lot of energy that makes the video so much more enjoyable to watch. That guy's wrong. - Alex: the power adapter is just off the wall. Well, I think that's how power adapters work, Alex. Yes (laughs). When you put it like that, a lot of things out of context sound pretty dumb. - This is tech today says Brandon Lee watching Brandon Li talking about the camera that we're both super interested in. (laughs) Yeah, I am assuming that this is the other Brandon Lee tech YouTuber who also sometimes watches our Short Circuit videos. I've watched a couple of his videos. So Brandon Lees gonna stick together, right? - I love Riley the most from the LTT team. He's so pure and wholesome. Aww! I certainly appear pure and wholesome. And that's what I try to do, so it's working. Haha, gotcha. (laughs) - Dude, he's so hyped... He looks like a kid at Christmas. Can you blame me? It's like the first time I got to unbox like a video game that I was actually excited about, and it was like this amazing press edition. It was literally better than like last 10 Christmases. Take a sip every time he says 'nice'. (breath whooshes) - Guy with the beard looks awfully similar to Linus from LTT. I can't tell if occasionally that comment is real. I see the comment, but I don't know if the people are just being funny or if some people actually are not sure. - Whenever Colton lets out a hearty belly laugh I can't help but laugh. (laughs) I can't, I can't. - Riley laughing at his own jokes is the purest thing. (laughs) And I will continue to laugh at my own jokes forever because... why not? If no one else is gonna do it. - Anthony has a God tier technical knowledge whenever he says, 'I think' it becomes a fact. I don't know what to think about that (laughs). Most of my knowledge is basically self-taught. I've more or less just all done it through experience. And I think the same is true for Linus. - I was waiting for Linus to be the first person to ever drop a 3000 series GPU. Did I? I didn't drop it in that video. - [Jono] No, no. He was just... - Yeah! Not in the video. - Internet: MAC SUCKS. Anthony: Runs windows, inside a VM on Windows, on a Mac using Bootcamp. What? (laughs) It's a good machine. The MacBook Pro 16 is actually a really nice machine. It runs Windows like a champ. - Cranks color temperature almost all the way to cool. The reds are pretty muted, and the greens are a bit too boosted. Okay, I... thank you, Eric Sugrue, if that's your real name, but also... they were. - Wow look at all this rear IO! Doesn't show the rear IO. I'm gonna blame you, David. - [David] I got shots of it. Blame the editor. - Yeah, okay. - [David] Yeah, I got shots of it for sure. - This is so true. Namarrkon says, I love how he points to everything with his middle fingers. Yes, and I love your profile picture. - Don't tell Riley he was killing bots. He was so excited. Yeah, I found out afterwards. (laughs) Well, at the same time when I was playing that, I was like they're probably bots, but I didn't really care, 'cause I was having a good time. You know what I mean? - Damn, I didn't know he was a newfie. But then I heard him say 'harsh' and then I knew. See that's the thing. Expatriated Newfoundlanders, they basically communicate in code like that. You only hear certain things, and because you're a Newfoundlander, you know what to listen for. So when I say car or harsh or, you know, how are you getting on? Oops. - [James] That's called dog whistling. - I went too far into the skeet territory of being a Newfie. Anyway, yeah, that's kind of dog whistling, but it's the good kind. - You guys might've noticed we had a bit of a uniform today. This is the special edition Short Circuit long sleeve. Unfortunately, what makes it special edition is that the arms are a little bit on the long side, so I would recommend it for lanky boys and girls only. And we'll bring it back eventually, hopefully once we figure out a different garment, but, yup, definitely long sleeves. Go check it out lttstore.com. Once they're gone, they are gone for a long time. Million subscribers, whoo! - Me: sees Linus. Also me: 'This has James scent smeared all over it.' True, sorry about that. (groans) I actually had a lot of faith in myself to be able to adopt Linus' mannerisms and totally fool people. But when it came down to it, I did a rookie move, and was like, David, we have an hour to shoot this. Let's just do it. And instead I should've just waited till Monday, spent the day, you know, practicing and I didn't, and then all the comments were like, Oh, this is immediately James. I can tell this is James. My actions are too like snappy. He does a lot of hand gestures, but he does them kind of like slow, I guess. But, yeah, mine are always like, nah, nah, nah. - Plot twist: this is the real Linus and the one with the beard is a computerized fake. What's under this beard? - Colton: 'I'm 160 pounds.' Me: 'Why would I care how much you cost, (Jono laughs) I can't afford you or the chair anyway.' (laughs) Yeah, like weight pounds, not pounds pounds. - 'We have to save something for the full review' translates as 'if anyone is going to break this $10,000 laptop, it's going to be Linus, not me.' Actually, I still really want to do that. It's absolutely terrifying. Ace has kind of showed me like the process a bit, and it involves like this big hydraulic thing that comes in, it's like whomp, pulls off the screen, I kinda wanna just want to YOLO it and like get some sponges in there. - I activated your Google Home. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. Look, okay, Google devices are not the kind of thing that we want to activate by accident. Hey, seriously. - Storm Riordan says, Every time I see Brandon has a new camera related Short Circuit, I shutter with excitement. Excellent use of the word shutter. Ten out of ten pun. - Ben Schofield says, Honestly, I love when Riley is in videos 'cause there's no knowing what he's gonna say next and it's hilarious. Incredulity... is a word that describes how... - Companies should be consistent. Also Linus: 'I need small mice because I have small hands, but I also want a water bottle I can barely hold on to.' Okay, I only brought the big one out because you guys asked for it. lttstore.com. - This one's from the iMac unboxing by NoSwear. having flashbacks at the last time Anthony was close to an iMac. (Jono laughing) (Anthony breathes heavily) - I lost it when Colton yelled at Linus about sitting on the chair before the sponsor segment. That was just so funny. Yeah, that was funny. Cause Linus just ran in and he's like, What's going on? Do you know what you're doing? Oh wow, look at this. And then he punctured a hole in the thing. That was rough. - \"Linus still using his note 9, he really did marry that phone.\" Not anymore. Oh, well, yeah, okay, yes, this is it now, but, but also I just got a Fold Z2. (whistling) (bell dings) So stay tuned. That video is gonna be coming. Make sure you're subscribed. One million is not enough. Is it just me or does Linus seem like he's way more blunt in his recent videos?...definitely getting funnier. That's just me not really caring. This is just like the (beep) tier channel. No offense, no offense everyone who works on this channel. We don't even have the proper old gold play button. Got the new like cheapo cost down one. - Wife: Come watch Netflix with me. James: BUT IT'S ALMOST MY BED TIME!!! Who told you? This is too real. (laughs) I get like notoriously grumpy after 9:00. Everyone knows like, Oh, it's past his bedtime. Don't talk to him. - Looks like Linus is going through a mid-life crysis. Got 'em! - Thank you so much for subscribing. That's amazing that we've made it to a million subscribers in such a short amount of time. - Honestly, this channel has been one of the most fun things that LMG has done, because I've actually been able to cover way more cameras than I've otherwise been able to cover on LTT. - I just want to thank all you guys for all the comments that you leave for me and for everybody else. I read all of mine at least. You seem to really like this format of the show, and I like to do it, too. - Look at all these various people who watch our videos and subscribe. There's a million of them out there probably, you know? - One million? I never saw that coming, and I never saw it sneaking up so quickly after TechLinked like that. And I'm pretty upset about it, actually. Stop subscribing, if you wouldn't mind (laughs). - [David] No! Love ya! - No, I'm not doing your sign off. I'm not thanking them. I deserve all of it. (men laugh) No seriously though, thank you guys. And more to come. You know it's never the end. - Cue the Short Circuit outro song Short Circuit Short Circuit Short Circuit Let's unbox, yeah Let's unbox, yeah (beep) - [David] You know what they can subscribe to? - (laughs) What? - [David] Carpool Critics! - Carpool Critics movie podcast! That's our logo. - [David] The Carpool Critic logo. - [Jono] That's a ShortCircuit shirt. - [David] No, that's Carpool Critics. - See look, there's a \"C\" there. You can see it. Editor, highlight two \"C's\" in there. Prove me right. Or prove me a fool.",

    "description": "(   ) --- Today's Mystery Video -  Plazmatic X (USA Link) -  Plazmatic X (International Link) -   This has to be the coolest lighter I've ever seen. It's got this crazy, purple electric beam and is unaffected by the wind. It's also USB rechargeable and a single charge is good for 100 lights.  From the manufacturer -  Why spend hundreds on disposable lighters that harm the environment when you can own a Plazmatic X! The most revolutionary, eco-friendly USB rechargeable lighter in the world. Designed in the heart of Silicon Valley, the Plazmatic X electric lighter is specifically engineered to work in any weather, in any condition, and save you money. The Plazmatic X features a beautiful stainless, durable zinc alloy exterior, weighing in at a hefty 6 oz. Whether you're lighting tobacco products, hemp wick, or firing up charcoal in the grill, Plazmatic X lighter gets the job done every time. This lighter is specifically engineered with a wide lighting surface that can spark nearly anything including cigars, water pipes, hemp wick, candles (even wood ones), incense, and more. Plazmatic X is 100% electric and the most powerful USB rechargeable lighter on the planet. Simply plug the lighter into any USB port for about an hour to fully charge and get 100+ lights per charge. This means no inhaling nasty butane or other mystery chemicals, and never having to refill another lighter again. Plazmatic X is butane and chemical free - in fact, it contains no fluids or gas at all - and is equivalent to fifty disposable lighters. Be part of the movement to reduce the 1.9 billion disposable lighters that end up in the landfill and oceans every year. Our environment will thank you later.

    "transcript": "This might be the coolest lighter in the world... That's the claim. The 'Plazmatic X', From a company called 'Elementium Lighter'. They say the most badass lighter in the world. Now right about now, you're wondering, What makes a badass lighter? I don't get it, doesn't it just light, or not light? Not so much! It's more complicated than that. Like many things in life, and many things that you see here on Unbox Therapy, there's a step up! This lighter, is USB-recharable. That doesn't even seem right, like how is a lighter... There's no butane in here! \"Flameless, and wind-proof.\" \"100+ lights per charge.\" And \"Beard-friendly.\" Although, I didn't know that regular lighters weren't beard-friendly. Let's find out! Now, you're thinking with a lighter that must only be for smoke cigarettes. No, you might want to start a fire, You might be a survivalist-type dude, and you don't want to rely on, the traditional medium for starting a flame Or, you just like cool stuff like me, And you want to check it out. Woah, look at that right there. If that ain't cool, i don't know what is. Look at the bottom there, micro USB to charge it up- I'm gonna put that down from a- it feels so fancy, oh my goodness... Here is the micro USB cable for charging it up- i hope it has a little bit of a charge on it. They also sent me this one over here- Slightly diffirent design Look at that! Got the, like, wood grain appearance to it. So, this is- We're about to have a magic moment together Look at this! Open that up- It looks kinda like a tazer, do you see that there? And then you hit the button WHOOOA! Can you- are you? That's insane! And it's like a purple It's like a purple electric- I can't even blow it ou- *blows electric beam* *blows it again* Are you kidding me right now? That's futuristic right there Look at this Who wants- COME ON! What kind of loser is gonna pull that thing out?! Oh, by the way In the wind- You- Oh you are lighting stuff If what you need to do is light? It would not be an Unbox Therapy video without a demonstration We are bringing back The Don Tomas from a previous video- I don't even remember what that video was Where did these come from? It was the case, the iPhone case with the built in lighter! Go watch that video, that's a crazy one I told you in that video, i don't smoke, i don't recommend doing it either But For the purpouse of demonstration Simetimes it's just your job to do so It's like a movie actor, you know, Tom Cruise If the roll calls a cigarette, the man grabs a cigarette And right now, my role is demanding a Don Tomas So, as a personal sacrifice for all of you watching We are going to test this lighter, it's one of the toughest things in the world to light And that, of course, is a Don Tomas classic. That's unbelieveable Did you see that?! When you- WOOW!? This thing is not playin' around Unbelieveable. Are we gonna set the- Are we gonna set the- uhh...",

    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine, and today we are doing something really fun. Not only are we gonna have an unboxing of the simplehuman cleanstation, which can clean your phone in 30 seconds and get rid of about 99.9% of germs, but we're also doing a 30-second challenge of some suggestions of things you'd like to see me complete while my phone is being cleaned in 30 seconds. A huge thank you to simplehuman for sponsoring this video. This is gonna be incredible, because I'm so obsessive about germs and cleaning. So the fact that this is something that I can basically just put my phone into, It will automatically raise and lower your phone. So it's kind of a touch-free experience, which is really cool, because inside of it, it has 30 UVC LEDs to kill 99.9% of germs across the entire phone. Let's unbox it and get cleaning. It kind of looks like a little toaster for your phone. (chuckles) I love this. (slow upbeat music) I'm a huge fan of simplehuman. You guys may have seen trash cans that I have around the house. I even have one that's voice-activated, that I say, \"open can,\" and you know what it does? It opens the can! Oh, it actually looks like a mini version of the trash can. This is so cute! Wow! It really looks like a little toaster. It's super cute. All right, here we go. (device whirs) The suspense, it's killing me. (device chimes and whirs) (slow upbeat music) This is the coolest thing ever. - [Tyler] Can I do mine? - Yeah, yeah you can put it in there. So Tyler has an iPhone 12. (device whirs) Like, this is so... It's like, I know you guys love space travel and, you know, things like that, but this, this is the future. Oh, you want to live on Mars? Uh, I'll be here cleaning my phone in 30 seconds to get rid of 99.9% of the germs. (device chimes) I'll clean my friends phones. - [Tyler] Thank you! - You're welcome. So, you guys challenged me on some things that you'd like to see me try to complete in 30 seconds while my phone is cleaning. So, let's take a look at what some of those are, and hope that I'll be able to complete them. The first one is from Mark, and he wants me to neatly fold a fitted sheet. That might be, like, my biggest nightmare. I like that he said, \"neatly\". (device whirs) (upbeat whimsical music) Ow! (device chimes) Oh, I honestly think that my talent is unmatched. This one says, \"chainsaw.\" I don't know what that means. We all know I love my chainsaw. I'll chainsaw something for 30 seconds. (fast heavy metal music) Am I done yet? (device chimes) I think this whole tree is dead, to be honest with you. Are you okay? (chainsaw whirs) \"Rubik's cube.\" Oh, I can only solve in under three minutes, so I don't know about 30 seconds. Oh yeah, I got this. (peppy organ music) (device chimes) 30 seconds! Whoa, sign me up for whatever Rubik's cube tournament's coming up next! Oh, a fitness challenge. \"Do as many barbell squats or BW pull up...\" I don't know what BW means, and I can't do pull-ups because I don't have a pull-up bar. So, I'll just do some squats. Do not let me go a second over 30 seconds. Here we go! (upbeat electronic music) Are we're done yet? Is my phone clean? \"Oh Justine, why are there no weights on your barbell?\" Don't judge me! (device chimes) I wasn't counting. Makeup? A 30-second makeup challenge? Accepted! Set a timer for 30 seconds. - [Siri] Thirty seconds counting down. (slow ethereal music) - Have you seen such beauty as this? No! Come on, I didn't even get my lipstick on! (device chimes) Find an air tag within 30 seconds. Huh? Okay. All right, Tyler, 30 seconds. Ready? Let's roll. (light playful music) (rapid beeping) How did you get in here? Really? (device chimes) Who put my keys in the tomatoes? Who? Change an Apple watch band. (fast upbeat music) Woaaaaa! (inhales deeply) (device chimes) Did I make it? Put together your perfect cheeseburger and artfully photograph it. Get out of here. (fast upbeat music) (device chimes) Artfully photographed. (chuckles) Flip water bottle challenge. I don't know how to do that. Oh, that's hard. Why would someone suggest this? - [Tyler] Close. - It's close. I hate this. Oh my God. I'm so talented. - [Tyler] It was under 30 seconds. - It was, I win. - [Tyler] You're done the- - We're done. That was our last suggestion, so guess what? I win everything. What do I win? I win a clean phone. Well guys, thank you so much for watching this video. This is such a cool new product and I'm very, very excited about this. I just love how sleek and small it is and the fact that it's automatic, I can just drop my phone in, and then take it out when it's done. I'll put a link in the description if you guys want to get more information, or to purchase one of these. And again, a huge thank you to simplehuman for sponsoring this video. I'm such a huge fan of all of their products. So the fact that they are here supporting my channel with this incredible new product I am so excited about. So I will see you guys in the next video. Bye! Bye. At this point, I've cleaned it so many times. It's gonna be extra clean. (slow upbeat music)",

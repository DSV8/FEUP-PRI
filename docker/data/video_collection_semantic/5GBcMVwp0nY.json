    "transcript": "- You want a fricking amazing looking TV? It's gonna be OLED. Same with like the phone that you're watching this on right now, probably also an OLED and it looks frigging amazing, but for whatever reason on laptops, OLED screens just suck. For whatever reason, they give me really bad headaches when I look at them and just like white backgrounds and text, not good. Samsung though thinks that they have fixed that. So this guy right here apparently has the same OLED screen as they have on the S21. Wait, is it S21? - [Jono] I think it was S21 Ultra. - S21 Ultra. Well, it's not the same screen, it's using the same technology. - [Jono] Oh. (both chuckle) - Wow, this is one of the most engineering sample laptops that I have received in a while. Normally they at least like half try, they just threw this in a box, look at that. Great packing job guys, there we go. Wait, this doesn't look right. I asked for the 13-inch model. I think we got the 15. Now, before we open it up, let's just do a quick tour. First of all, this thing is super small especially given it has full-size HDMI right there along with what, two thunderbolt fours. And on the other side, we have full-size USB type A and what looks like a little SD card reader. So like Dell, what are you doing? Why does everyone else say like, \"Oh yeah, we can't have full full-size USB type A,\" when like this things thinner than everyone else's laptops? Build quality feels pretty good. This bottom here is very, very plastic. The overall look like it's very plain, it's just blue. But it does have a real premium look to it. That's something that like, I don't understand. It was like, Samsung makes these exceptional looking phones and many other things that are good, but until now, their laptops have really fallen behind everything else. But let's open her up. I wasn't planning on starting it right yet, but oh geez. (chuckles) So my initial impressions of the chassis are not the greatest ever. There's a big squish zone right about here. Yeah, that's a lot of deflection and I'm not pressing very hard. - [Jono] Is it flexing because it's on a mat though? - Jono asked it's because it's on the mat, it's not, this is 100% the laptop. (chuckles) Also, oh, dang it, Samsung. I asked them for the one with the touch screen because there's always a problem where. So you have to have like your actual screen and then a touchscreen layer that goes over top of it. Some of the OLEDs that don't have touch screens look way better on laptops than the ones that do because it has this little like grid over top of it that isn't designed perfectly for OLED screens. Well, Windows says we're almost there, which means, oh wow, we're in, just like we're into a segue to our sponsor, PIA. Private Internet Access is a VPN that allows you to access services and websites as if you're in a different country. It encrypts all of your internet traffic and uses a safe protected IP. Connect up to 10 devices at once with clients for Windows, Mac iOS, Android, iOS, and Linux. Buy a one-year plan for 39.95 using the link in the video description. I wanna check out the keyboard first just because it feels snappy. (keyboard typing) This keyboard's a bit of a disappointment because whoever did these switches did an exceptional job. They feel great, they're super snappy, you can probably even hear it like. (keyboard typing) Awesome. Unfortunately, again, the chassis is just a bit too flexy. So getting a really good, consistent key feel is difficult, when over here, you're getting like a millimeter or so of deflection every time that you hit it. Anyway, why we're actually here is the display. So let's turn this up. Apparently it's display HDR 500 certified. Yeah, that look. Dave, can we turn off the light that's back there? - [David] No. - Very glossy display. (chuckles) Wow, okay, there we go. So if you're going to be using this in bright environments as we just found out, don't buy it, it's terrible. I've never noticed that there's a light back there before when doing laptop stuff. In the top down here, my hands are reflecting in the display and it's just mirror like. That said, if you plan on using this in a dark room, this looks exceptional, this looks so fricking good. I shouldn't be surprised it has like something stupid like a million to one contrast ratio and it's an OLED display. But at the same time, damn. Actually, where is our charger? I just had Jono plug in the thing because it looks like that the brightness is dropping when you're going to a full, white display. So like right now it's clearly not giving me 500 nits of brightness, whereas it pops a lot more when we have a lot of darker stuff on the display. - [Jono] Play some \"Crab Rave\", I wanna see. - No, just wait, we'll get to \"Crab Rave\", Jono. Just a second, I need to talk about this screen some more, so. (both laugh) So although you might be kind of bummed out that on a whole white display, you aren't getting the full brightness searing your eyeballs. I kinda like it because in the past, some OLED displays have just been too bright when you have a full, white background and it can kinda give you headaches. So it is nice that it dips with it but at the same time, don't use this outside ever. The uniformity looks pretty good. That's another complaint that I had before on OLED displays on laptops. Like you get kind of just this grainy look over the whole thing. When you have one color, this looks really good. There is a tiny bit of, I guess you could call it oddness, but it's not too bad, let's watch something. Okay, I'll do \"Crab Rave\" for you, Jono. We'll do the speakers at the same time. So this is only a 1920 by 1080P display. So that is one of the things that I am kinda bummed out. I wish that it was 16 by 10 instead of 16 by nine but like this panel is awesome. (chuckles) (upbeat music) Oh my God, the black levels, look at that. (chuckles) Speakers don't have much for balls though. (upbeat music) Okay, so the speakers are like fine on that but I'm actually getting the XPS out here because its display is so fricking good. IPS versus OLED, I believe they're both 500 nits as well, so. (upbeat music) (gentle music) Yeah, there's way more saturation on the IPS. I'll give you a quick little speaker test here as well. (upbeat music) This is a Samsung. It's not even a competition. For display, it's a hard one. I'm really surprised, I figured that you'd have a noticeably better black levels on the OLED but the IPS that Dell has here looks exceptional. I feel like that just general display tuning will be the difference between which one of these looks better. But I am very curious about what's actually going on in the Samsung OLED so that it doesn't look like trash. Other OLEDs on laptops, they didn't look good. This one looks exceptional. Let's have a little look, shall we? And how it's fricking nerd out time. So grabbed our new microscope, which for one, is way better than our old one but also the software is hot garbage from like 2005, so we'll see how that goes. So first of all, we're gonna look at the XPS which has an IPS display, right? 90 times magnification and this thing is hair trigger for focus. Oh my God, you absolute piece of junk. Yeah, we're seeing about 1.6 FPS. Whoever made this software, AmScope. Hello, fix it, please. But that's basically what it looks like. And now I want to take a look at my phone which has an OLED display. And I think that it uses the kinda chittering method. Oh no, it isn't a chittery one. On old-school kind of like OLED stuff, they would have it so that the blue subpixels were bigger than the red and the green because it takes way more energy to create blue light. Because like wavelengths, that crap. You burn out your blue pixels way faster than the red and the greens. So it makes sense that you would want them to be a little bit bigger but it can be really hard on your eyes, especially if you have like a slight stigmatism in one of them. But as you can see, the red, green and blue pixels are all the same. Maybe you can't see because this thing is having a lot of trouble. Okay, that's as good as we're gonna get on this. But you get the picture, whole bunch of little dots. They're all very uniform. That is what we are looking for on the Samsung one here 'cause if it has that similar kind of pixel arrangement, that means they're not cheating for this generation and I am very excited to find out. Whoa, this is so weird. What the (beep). (both chuckle) Oh, this is one of the weirdest subpixel arrangements that I've ever seen. I feel like that they kind of took the pixel size of a 4K display. Yeah, so you get the same number of red and green and blue pixels but it's so weird because the blues are much bigger and they're also sort of in a row. So you get alternating red, green, red, green, red, green, red, green, and then there's rows of blue so that they can be bigger and presumably less bright. In the past, that's made me feel terrible, like it's given me headaches. But for whatever reason, it doesn't with this one. And it must just be because it's a 1080P resolution, is it a 4K, I don't know. But I like this one and judging by the subpixels, I don't think I should, (chuckles) wait. What? (laughs) So do you remember how I was complaining about the chassis stiffness? You can click the track pad by pushing the bottom. Oh, (chuckles) Samsung, come on. - [Jono] Man. - But the good news is, is that Samsung's displays go into everything, like every single OLED screen in a laptop that's on the market right now, Samsung makes it. This right here, despite me not really wanting to recommend this laptop, it's not terrible. It's pretty light. What's the price on it, Jono? - [Jono] Also what is the specs? - This one right here has, let's see. Oh, see, I can't click the touch pad when I'm holding it in my hand 'cause it's already clicked. (chuckles) - [Jono] Can you click the touch pad by just pressing down on the body? - Yeah, I can click the touch pad by just pushing here. (chuckles) - I don't have the price. - So we don't have a price on this. Yeah, if we have a price, it'll be right here. If it's like not all that expensive, then sure, go for it, I guess. Oh, it's so frustrating. Okay, let's have a little chat, Samsung. This laptop is infuriating because you got so much of it right. This track pad, the size is great. The feel is awesome, it's really good. Whoever designed this track pad, give them a raise. Same with the keyboard, this keyboard is awesome. The click feel, exceptional overall besides it being French, really like it. This display, it's one of the best that I've ever seen in a laptop. This chassis, (laptop chassis flexing) it's terrible. I didn't expect it to make that sound, but it really, (chuckles) it really brings it home. Just invest in like even just a good stamped aluminum chassis and I would daily drive this laptop because otherwise, it is freaking awesome. This is in many ways, one of the best laptops that I've looked at in a really long time. It is so light, this display is awesome. I would daily drive it, but I can't. You can't use the track pad when you're holding it because it's clicked. That's where they're at. I don't know if I went over the specs, It has an i7, 16 gigabytes of RAM. Oh, this one right here actually has 5G, which is frigging awesome. Also another thing, you did great. Oh, and Jono just told me that it's 68 Watt-hour battery. With this processor, that is going to give you so much battery life, it's probably like 12 hours plus. Then again, it's an OLED display, but it's 1080P OLED display, I don't know. There's a whole bunch of different things but you're gonna have good battery life with this thing. Samsung, you are so close to creating the best laptop on the market. With this thing right here, it's like everything that the LG gram should be minus the good feeling of the LG gram. (chuckles) I hope that you enjoyed this. I wanna break up the microscope more, and AmScope, if you saw this, fix your webcam, I will use this all the time. Yeah, that's it, have a great old day, get subscribed, like, so long. (chuckles)",

    "transcript": "- Hey, guys, it's Justine and today I'm gonna go through my top five favorite features in iOS 14. This is a beta version and, obviously, if you do have a developer's account, you'll have access to the beta versions of software. It is recommended that you do not install this on your main devices. It is beta, there's still bugs, it is still new software that they're working to release later on this year. So since I do have a developer's account, I do have it running on one of my other phones and I'm so excited to show this to you guys. My number one favorite new features is Messages. They have a bunch of new updates to the Messages app. My favorite, though, is the fact that you can now pin messages. Now, this is a group chat with Faruk and Jenna. I named them Fun Friends. So you can go into this, you can change the photo, you can change the name. I'm shooting a video. So now let's go down here and I'm gonna change this to a shrimp. I'm making a video about our group here on iOS 14. Now I'm gonna at Faruk so I'll be alerting Faruk that I'm tagging him in this message. Jenna doesn't currently have iOS 14 yet so she's not even gonna be able to see this. Did you see this cool mention feature? And there it is; it'll highlight his name. And you can also go in and add inlines so you can reply in the texts to direct messages. So if you have a ton of chats happening, you can do this. Look at me reply inline. Jenna can't 'cause she's lame. I can reply to Jenna, though. So you'll see this line connects this chat together and if I just wanna see that conversation I can click on the reply and that will bring up just that inline chat. So this is gonna help so much when you're having group conversations with people. I'm really excited about that. So, when I go back to Messages, you'll see that Jenna just posted a new message in that thread. She says, \"I am living in the past.\" You can see Jenna's little icon! It's so cool! Next up, we have new Memojis. I am so excited. I absolutely love Memojis. I'm such a huge fan so I'm gonna make my new Memoji here. I'm gonna put some nice blush on my cheeks because I'm always overdoing it. Beauty spots. So, I have one right here. I still need to move the beauty spot over. I feel like you should be able to adjust that. Hairstyles. There are so many different hairstyles. Let's do- I just don't know. What does my hair even look like? Like that? That could do; I kind of have some highlights. Oh my gosh, they do have a gradient. This is incredible. So, they have new aging options here so you can make yourself older or younger. I mean, let's be real. Eyewear. So, I don't wear glasses unless I'm recording a podcast. So, if I did, I usually have blue ones so like that. Like, there I am. And now for the face covering. There we go. I'm usually wearing a black mask. I think that's it. Oh my gosh, how cool. I'm gonna send a message to Jenna. Hey, Jenna, just wanted to remind you to wear your face mask! Okay, cool, bye! What happens if I stick my tongue out? (laughs) Nothing. Okay, see you! My next favorite thing is the new addition to Widgets. So, you can add different widgets in the widget gallery. So, you can search for all sorts of things. You can make a really cool smart stack here. So, you can add a bunch of different things into this and they can be flipped through easily. So we're gonna add this Widget. So here's our stack. Now, we can change this and we can put this on the front page. I also have my calendar right here so if I want to move that around... I mean, imagine this. Like, if I put my battery on my front home screen. (laughs) We don't want that! I am always looking at the weather so I'm gonna go in and I'm gonna edit this Widget. I can pick my location. And then as soon as that's chosen, I can just take this and I can also put this on my home screen as well. There's also the new App Library which kind of goes hand in hand with this. This will give you a nice, organized look at all of your apps. So, it automatically will organize everything into categories. So, we have our utilities, productivity, social, and all of these things are automatically filtered into folders. Like, I did this before on my phone- on my actual phone that I use daily- and it was the most absurd thing ever because it took me so long to do that and then I kind of gave up and all my apps just ended up (laughs) wherever they wanted to be. I know I said Messages was my number one favorite feature, but I also am very excited about Picture in Picture. Here's the trailer for one of the new Apple TV shows so you can just click right here. This gives you the picture-in-picture options so I can move this around wherever I want. I can go into my notes. So I can still be working on my Notepad. Hello, I am- move you- I am writing and watching a trailer. Oh, this is gonna be so awesome. And then if I fling it down to the bottom, it stays off to the side so I can still here the audio but the video I won't be able to see. So, I just kind of pull that video back out from the arrow button and I can put it wherever I want. This is so great! Picture in Picture! It's here. This will also work on your iPad too, so cannot wait. I'm actually kind of excited to see this Apple TV show as well. Let me know in the comments below what you're most looking forward to with iOS 14. These were some of my favorites and I cannot wait until these are finally rolled out into the wild during iPhone season, which will be here before we know it. Thank you, guys, so much for watching. Be sure to subscribe and be sure to hit the bell so you'll be alerted when I release a new video. I'll also put a link in the description where you can subscribe to our podcast. And we have a special WWDC episode up right now so go check it out and I will see you guys in the next video! Bye-bye! (upbeat music)",

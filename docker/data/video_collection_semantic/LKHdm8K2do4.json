    "transcript": "and this here is another viewer's broken gaming pc now for those who are new to the fixture flop playlist what we do here is reach out to the local area typically somewhere in and around orlando florida i meet with viewers who have broken systems i pick up their systems i bring them back to my house and i attempt to fix them for free i don't charge them a dime as long as they're okay with me filming the process in the meantime now this particular computer was only built maybe two weeks ago it's actually a fairly young build and that is super unfortunate the fact that the owner is already running into pretty serious issues and i will tell you up front that they sound more software related than anything else which means this one's going to be more than likely a p-i-t-a i'm not going to bother translating that acronym i think most of you know what that stands for pc related software issues can send you down so many rabbit holes it's not even funny you can find yourself spending a week or more trying to troubleshoot a single issue that is either causing your pc not to turn on or maybe to turn on and then immediately turn off or blue screen over and over and over and that was actually what was happening with this build until the system decided to just kick the can and not work anymore so we're gonna figure out what exactly is wrong and hopefully fix it in this video stay with me to get rid of that annoying activation watermark hop on over to vip std key and purchase a windows 10 pro oem key for fractions of the price of retail just use the secure payment method like paypal receive your key in seconds and activate your os here bye bye watermark and be sure to use our new offer code skgs for a sweet discount now one of the more obvious the issues i would say this build has is lack of good cable management i'm just going to be blunt um i mean come on i'm not sure if he wasn't able to like route these cables around the back side of the motherboard tray or what we've got one eight pin pci supplemental cable running through the cutout for a front radiator and then the other one is running through where it should be run that's the cutout here at the rubber grommet cutout for pcie power so um just kind of weird stuff we've got you know a bunch of cables that are pretty loose pretty slack here not routed uh in an ideal way so uh that will definitely be taken care of another glaring issue physically is the fact that he's got this aio zip tied yeah it's zip tied to the top of the case i'm not sure how well you're gonna be able to see this on camera but he actually has this radiator screwed in at two corners up top and then zip tied around the other two corners and this is actually a pretty clever solution because his ram clearance was preventing him from mounting the radiator where you would otherwise you know properly mount it in this corsair case so what i might end up doing is moving this red assembly to the front and rotating these fans to be set to intake so we'll have three intake fans and now i'll move these black fans to the top and rear those will be set to exhaust so three intake three exhaust it will still be balanced on that side of it uh the other two things i'm sure people are probably thinking about by this point uh you know having a front mounted radiator oh you're gonna totally compromise your graphics card temperatures that is totally not true i'm not sure why people think that you're going to get like a 10 or 15 degrees celsius bump in gpu temperatures all because you moved your radiator to the front as long as you're evacuating air effectively and in this case you can definitely do that temperatures will be fine the other concern people have when you are front-mounting your radiator is that oh you're gonna you're gonna kill your pump i don't know why all those people watch one or two videos and totally take things out of context they don't draw the same conclusions as even the video creator himself and they assume that because the barbs are up top and the block is situated fairly high that the block is just going to pull in tons of air bubbles and the acetate pump is going to die that is simply not true if the barbs are situated higher than the pump itself i mean this is a simple fluid dynamics here you're not going to be able to push with a weak pump air that is lighter than water downward into the pump over and over most of the air will settle at the top of the radiator and if the loop is filled properly that shouldn't be a problem shouldn't even cause any sound issues to be frank but anyway with those disclaimers out of the way because i feel like i have to address that every time i talk about radiator positioning nowadays uh and the uh mentioning of the cable management that definitely needs to be addressed let's get into the email that i received from the owner he was describing in detail what he was experiencing and there's um yeah quite a bit to go through the software side is a bit of a mess so he says he just built his first ever pc remember this is a fairly new rig maybe a week or two old and went all out he got an rtx 3090 in here i believe an r9 5900x either 16 or 32 gigs of ddr4 two dimms there uh he has an rm850x power supply really nice corsair case aio right the works you know a very um powerful gaming pc the rtx 3090 is probably a bit overkill but he said he bought this i think from best buy so he probably didn't have much to choose from and if he bought it at around msrp then it's really not that terrible of a deal and seen in the context of what people are willing to pay on ebay anyway he says he loaded up wz and boom it crashed wc's war zone by the way he said wc in there but uh yeah cod warzone crashed his system caused a blue screen of death and the blue screen said the error code was w-h-e-a uncorrectable error okay and i i've personally seen this before it's not an error you want to see he says that what he you know what he did was what most people would do he restarted the system uh but it kept popping up and i asked him how frequently he was popping up i said it was like every 10 or 15 seconds from there on after so it wasn't like it was just gaming that was bringing up the blue screen of death it was just trying to boot into windows it would cut straight to a blue screen and give him that same whea error he searched for ways to fix it tried a bunch of things and now he can't even load up uh windows on his ssd says the ssd won't even show up as a boot device in his bios that's uh that's a big problem yeah so we're gonna work our magic i hope and get this thing working again first thing we do is plug it in and attempt to replicate the things he's describing in the email and with everything now connected got my little mini display here let's see what we see power on okay everything lights up that looks good let's see if we get a post okay we've got a post it says usb devices detected zero no keyboard detected 16 gigs of ram detected all right so it'll either kick us into the bios or into the boot device okay yeah so it went straight to bios uh that probably indicates that it doesn't detect a boot device anymore so let's navigate over here to the boot tab and nada i am not seeing yeah i'm not seeing a boot drive at all there's literally no option here like for for any drive to be booted into um i can check some of his settings in here just to see maybe he's got like you know yeah sometimes it's like legacy mode only but all of this looks okay wait my this this might be something let's try uefi only and i believe his only storage drive here is a it's an nvme drive so that's pcie and we're going to try uefi now and we'll save changes and reset see if that does anything so i have tried a bunch of different settings here i have enabled the disabled csm usually just leave this enabled to be fine i have also gone into secure boot here this was set to other os and uh yeah you can see here native nvme driver support enabled he does have an nvme connected and and we're still not getting yeah we're we're not booting into a uh into a bootable volume which is interesting now we can actually see the drive in the nvme configuration tab it's very clearly a sabrin rocket 4.0 one terabyte i'm assuming 4.0 stands for pcie 4.0 but you can see right here where it says total size 0.0 gigabytes that's um that's a bit sus because it says right above it that it's a one terabyte drive so a couple other things we're going to try first off i'm going to try enabling pcie 3.0 and bypassing 4.0 which yeah it's it's rare that that causes an issue especially with storage drives but i'm going to try it nonetheless just to rule out that being an issue and that could be associated with the motherboard who knows or potentially the bios revision that it is running the other thing i'm going to try is the obvious resetting the cmos if there is some setting in here that i am not finding that is set to the wrong thing that could prevent the drive from being detected in the way that it needs to be detected i don't think that would fix the issue but it's so simple and so quick that it doesn't make sense to not do it and neither of those things worked not that i am all that surprised again so what i decided to do was connect my bootable usb uh which has a windows media creation tool loaded into it all we have to do is connect it to the pc and when we turn it on the system automatically boots into that bootable media brings us to this page here where we can install a windows operating system onto any other connected drive the drive shows up that's a good thing but what it shows next to the drive is not a good thing so this is the drive first off concerning that he said he already had an operating system on here was literally playing warzone on this drive and all it says is unallocated space that's no good so something happened to the volumes he created on here the different partitions and then also total size 0.0 megabytes free space 0.0 again this is a one terabyte severant uh pci 4.0 drive this right here my friends is an indication that this drive is almost certainly dead now to be clear and up front a lot of nvmes i've worked with have been fine over the years including some more recent pci 4.0 drives it is very strange that only after a week or two of owning the system and building it himself the drive suddenly crapped its pants and all he was doing was playing warzone it's not like you're heavily stressing anything in this drive you could do a lot more synthetically to put a heavier load on these and you know it's not like he's rewriting data over and over anything like that the drive just kicked the can and um again i can't speak to severan's track record but it is definitely odd for it to die so quickly uh so the next obvious step will be to swap his drive out for one that works now i'm not sure if i have a pci 4.0 drive in there the good thing though about his system is that because it is so new and he bought all these parts pretty much uh separately on either amazon or in store like best buy he can claim a warranty on these devices so i'm going to take that cyber drive out and i'm going to tell him to attempt to send it back for a refund if he doesn't have the original box which is one of the reasons why i always tell you guys to keep your boxes especially if you uh you know expect something to die within the first year or so if you keep the box it's a very simple return process assuming it is warrantied or assuming you have a you know e-retail like amazon fulfilling things um but if you don't have the box then you might need to go through the manufacturer directly and that could take a lot more time now what i have here is a corsair mp600 this is a one terabyte pcie 4.0 nvme uh very similar to the cyber drive and his build i think that those speeds in the seven are a bit faster than these nonetheless it's going to be as close as we can get at least with the parts that i have on hand to a one-to-one trade here and i know this one works because i've used it in previous builds so what i'm going to do is reformat it we're going to connect this to his motherboard and then reinstall windows a fresh copy on this so let's get this old drive out of here i believe it is in the uppermost m.2 slot and there she is what i believe to be a dead nvme drive so this one's uh it's looking a bit yeah a bit jank this is like a really thin copper sheet it looks like and i'm not sure why it's like totally bent out of shape it shouldn't be like that it should be flush but we can take a look here at the drive itself and i don't really see any obvious issues it just could just come down to a dead controller or something but uh i'm going to actually reconnect this into the lower m.2 slot in his board once we get the uh the new one i'm giving him installed and we're gonna see if the if any software will detect this drive and if so what it says is wrong with it they might just say that you know the data is corrupt etc but i just want to see if we can uh get any kind of diagnosis via software with this thing now we'll get the new drive connected i'm not going to bother securing it just yet because again i would i do want to run some tests with that cyber drive just to see what is wrong so let that hang there and then we'll reconnect the uh the old drive into the lower slot now let's fire back up make sure that she posts and that we boot into windows i believe there is again an operating system on this new drive from one of my old builds so uh we'll confirm that i expect everything will work though now i think that the drive was to blame and we're still again the reason why i connected this old saver drive is is i want to make sure i want to confirm that it is a hardware issue associated with the drive specifically and not a software issue i've never really seen it where you've told like you could totally brick a drive by uh having a corrupt operating system there's something associated with with the software side of it but uh i do want to confirm that up front because these type of drives are not cheap right and uh if we can get by with with fixing whatever is wrong with it and reinstalling it that would be best so i think i think we're good now it was like reconfiguring drivers from the old uh from the uh the old drive that i put in there yep looking much better now and then we'll hop into disk manager see if we can see any partitions on that old drive i don't expect that we'll be able to and then we'll also download a like disk integrity checker so you can see here it's asking for us to initialize disk one a disk zero you can see up here is the one that uh that i gave him that's the mp600 again already has an operating system on it but uh it says for whatever reason his old disk that did have an operating system on it needs to be initialized so for whatever reason it's just uh it's not already good to go we're gonna click ok here and see yeah say that the parameter is incorrect something something big is uh is wrong with this drive it's it's i think it's hardware related and we're here in passmark's disk checker and you can see that yeah pretty much no activity on this drive this geometry is pretty much null we don't uh we actually do have an okay status here so it's weird it's like part of the controller is communicating properly to the computer but the remainder of the drive is not and then you can see this is our mp600 the one that i gave them this is what a healthy drive should look like here uh and we don't have any of this activity on the seven part of it's because we can't initialize it right we can't get it working in disk manager but uh i mean there's nothing i can do here i whenever i try to initialize it it says it's not possible and that's why i believe this drive is toast no matter what i try to do in software i cannot get this thing configured properly i can't get it to even detect that it previously had partitions installed and i cannot initialize it in an otherwise fully functional operating system oddly enough when i took this thing out right after powering the system down it was very very hot to the touch it wasn't being used though the mp600 in here that did have the operating system on it that we were showing on screen is nowhere near this hot it was i almost couldn't pick it up it was so scalding i'm not sure if that's part of the reason why it's not working but uh yeah just odd all around to see a drive like this a relatively new drive fail at least that's what i think happened so what we're gonna do now obviously we're gonna re-uh reconnect these little covers for both drive bays and then we're going to clean up cable management get this thing looking nice and spiffy i'm going to re-run several of these cables including this 8-pin eps and this eight pin leading to the graphics card gonna push this under here there's also yeah there's a few cables just like running around the side here we're gonna run these behind the motherboard tray keep them mostly out of sight we're also going to relocate this uh rather sketchily mounted radiator this should just wow yeah it was a really tight fit with those corsair dom plats i'm surprised he even got it in here let's remove this cpu block i'll be sure to re-paste them as well let's swap these fans around and now that everything's been essentially stripped down we've got the a-pin eps rerouted behind the motherboard tray so no longer awkwardly kind of trailing in front of the graphics card here i'm also going to upgrade him to a 360 millimeter aio from corsair so still the same brand still the same rgb capabilities but this is a 360 mil white elite capelix aio so a little different rgb in my my opinion looks a little better in that aio and it's been sitting in my closet so i'd like to upgrade him with that and the stuff the white contrast for that cooler everything else is pretty much black with the exception of the cables i like that he went with something that was a little less obvious you know he could have gone with the plain white or plain black sleeve cables here but the light blue is actually a nice touch the smaller cables down below are routed very cleanly this time around and now it's time to install the aio and here we are with the right side looking much cleaner than it was before i don't think i have a shot of that i just realized halfway through that i didn't even show you guys what the back of this looked like i mean it was okay but there are tons of little rgb cables and things running from these these fans remember there's six of them plus we've got this large controller to include so whenever you have things like that smaller peripherals to account for it becomes a lot more difficult to cable manage but this corsair case works out just fine and we used a lot of the little zip tie or tie strap points to keep things clean running mostly along the edges and down this center channel here so we're gonna get the right side panel back on we'll turn it around attempt to power it on make sure everything is plugged in correctly and then we'll install windows to finish things off so now that the strap i gave them is the only one connected and it has been formatted we can install windows on it click next and here we go and while this is happening i'm gonna go ahead and give it a quick dusting just to make it look good as new i mean it is basically a new pc build looking good and we've activated this copy with an oem pro key from vips cd key so he is now pretty much ready to go take care of drivers take care of any rgb software you want to install and your system is as good as new unfortunately he does need to reinstall his games he had everything loaded on a single drive and what that means is that if that drive fails and you have no physical backup uh you're gonna have to reinstall everything from scratch and we all know that cod warzone is a fairly large game a bit excessive if you ask me so that's probably gonna take him a little bit but at least his system is working again so i hope you enjoyed watching this troubleshooting process play out these are again always fun because they're more like puzzles you know you never really know what you're going to get when uh when one of these comes in you have an idea of where to start based on the uh the symptoms they describe but i i was pretty shocked to find out that this was a dead drive i was really just expecting it to be a corrupt operating system something we could easily fix with a fresh windows install which we had to do anyway with our bootable media but i didn't expect the nvme drive to be bricked at least that's what i've concluded based on the uh the symptoms i've seen it's it's very rare it's not something you run into a lot especially with newer drives or a drive that you just bought it could be an older generation of drive but if it's relatively new and hasn't been written over many times those usually don't fail right out of the box so it's good that we caught it early at least it's within the warranty window the return window more than likely so i'll be sure to give it back to him so that he can try to get his money back but we did nonetheless fix the issue with uh swapping this out with another drive an mp600 still very fast still gen 4 speeds that he can rock with this 5900x other things we addressed with this viewer's build we fixed the cable management big time i mean again we had you know cables running in front of the graphics card uh the pcie cable is being split one going through the radiator cutout and the other one going through the rubber grommet here on top of the basement i just looked a bit strange a lot of the smaller cables being wrapped around in ways that i really wasn't a fan of so we tried to keep this as minimalistic as possible keep the smaller cables especially out of the way nobody wants to see those uh and then really bring an emphasis to uh the the clean cut blue cables that he's got here um kind of difficult to see the eight pin plus the four pin up top uh being crunched a bit by these 120 mil fans the 24 pin though looking really fresh and unfortunately thanks to this little adapter that's included with the founders edition 30 series cards we can't see the two uh eight pin blue custom cables uh but everything else yeah looking mighty fine if you ask me with that if you guys enjoyed this one be sure let me know by giving this one a thumbs up i would appreciate that you can also consider subscribing if you have not already if that red button is unclicked be sure to click that that would go a long way thank you for that support also leave a comment down below let me know what you want to see next we are coming up at the uh we're coming up on the end here of this first season of fixer flop and i've got to say i am just i'm kind of shocked by how many people are having issues in the orlando florida area it is it's something that um in a way i'm grateful for obviously i don't want to wish ill will towards people's builds but i'm thankful that people are giving me a chance to fix their rigs especially you know rigs like these that are just built maybe a week or two after um you know a week or two after they start using them they they break that's no good i mean you don't want to find out after spending several thousand dollars on a build that potentially something you did resulted in it no longer working at all like this owner said he couldn't even get into windows it kept booting him into the bios what's up with that it was working just fine a day ago well that's what i'm here for to alleviate your concerns and hopefully diagnose the issue correctly i think we did so here that's all for this one thank you for watching my name is Greg, thanks for troubleshooting with me!",

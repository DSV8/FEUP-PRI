    "transcript": "what's up everyone Eber here with Hardware Canucks we're still here at CES 2019 might just pass by me if you didn't notice probably you might not notice but anyways we're still here the show get trying to bring you the best content or more content from the show floor but I want to talk about Corsair's new slipstream wireless technology and what and why it's super important for the future of gaming peripherals like keyboards mice and headsets so let's get started but first huge shout out to our sponsors Corsair Phanteks Razer MSI and Thermaltake because without them this trip really would not have been possible now a few days ago we posted a video about Corsair's new mice for 2019 and if you're interested in checking that out link is right over here but essentially we did talk a little bit about slipstream technology but we didn't really get too much into it and the reason is because we didn't have any information about the new tech but after having a one-on-one session with Corsair we have a lot actually there's a lot to be excited about this new technology and the fact that it's actually shipping on a $50 Mouse like the harpoon Wireless is pretty amazing now the intent for slipstream is to provide improvements for how wireless communications are handled with it response time should decrease ranges will get boosted and there should be less issues in areas with high wireless traffic basically what slipstream does is use the 2.4 gigahertz spectrum but with a proprietary protocol that's been developed by Corsair that port O'Call allows supporting peripherals to handle twice the number of wireless packets within a millisecond there's also intelligent frequency shift which actively scans the wireless spectrum to find the best transmit frequency so that's a lot of technical stuff to digest but what does that really mean for gamers well on a mouse like the harpoon wireless you're gonna get some more millisecond response times but supposedly are also expected to get about up to 60 hours of battery life with just a single charge and you could also use this male 60 feet away from the actual receiver and I'm kind of starting to wonder why would you even use that feature I mean for HTPC setups sure but 60 feet away is just like I just I mean it's cool tech but I want to know your thoughts on that particular you know feature in the comments down below basically the harpoon Wireless is the first in the lineup coming peripherals that will have slipstream technology but Corsair said that the biggest potential for it will be within wireless headsets the problem with current wireless headsets is that they do typically lack range and in some cases they do encounter interferences and the microphone quality is just not that great and we've encountered a more experienced them with previous wireless headset reviews now slipstream basically eliminates all of these issues by basically providing a high bandwidth connection that allows for downstream a high definition a game audio as well as lossless upstream voice communication at the same time that's just not possible with today's current wireless standards another interesting thing that Corsair mentioned is range on these headsets could be around a hundred feet which is pretty amazing and the last thing that I want to mention about slipstream is that up to four devices can run off a single USB controller which is actually pretty awesome because concerning laptops are slowly starting to get rid of you know full-size type-a ports and just getting you know a few ports this is a great way to you know be able to connect your wireless headset your peripheral so you are the peripherals and just control them via a single USB receiver the other thing that I wanted to discuss quickly is Corsair's Capellix X LEDs because they could be a game-changer in many ways traditional LEDs are mounted to a large surface and then there are separate controllers that require space corsair is now mounting their LEDs directly to the PCB which increases density brightness and overall efficiency this is a quick example showing the space necessary to mount 132 Capellix RGB LEDs versus a traditional RGB strip it's just really amazing to see this kind of technology miniaturizing in terms of what it means for products well there's a couple ways to look at Capellix because of its lower power consumption peripherals with the technology will provide much better battery life heat output will also be lower so incorporating them into things like memory and motherboards will come with less trade-offs as well Corsair was also showing off their first Capellix product with the Dominator platinum RGB it uses 12 individually addressable LEDs per module for some crazy-looking lighting effects and remember this is just where corsair starting so it'll be interesting to see where they go from here so there you guys have it it's really awesome to see a company like Corsair taking things differently with you know something like slipstream technology and of course you know a technology like complex with their RGB LED setup but I'm looking forward to what they can come upon in the next or their upcoming products for 2019 and of course the years to come but yeah let me know what you guys think about the two new things that we discussed in this video in the comments down below I'm Evo retiree canucks thank you so much for watching stay tuned for more CES 2019 coverage Dmitri is right over there chilling with his air pods and his iPhone 10s Michael is he's just chilling with his Lenovo notebook and we'll see you in the next video",

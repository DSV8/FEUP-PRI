    "transcript": "(electronic music) - [Michael] When I think Chromebook normally I think either low cost, low capability devices for school kids or super premium, super portable Pixelbooks for Google employees. I never think of gigantic desk top replacements. But Lenovo's Yoga Chromebook is just that. I just went hands on with this unit here at IFA 2018 in Berlin. But because it can be hard to get a sense of scale from a video, let me give you a little comparison. This is the Yoga Chromebook along side the biggest laptop Apple offers, The MacBook Pro 15 inch and that's not a small laptop. Part of the reason this is such a massive machine is that 15.6 inch touchscreen display which is available in either full HD or 4K resolutions. This isn't a light machine either, tipping the scales at 4.2 pounds, thanks to an all aluminum casing. The space is used well though. For ports you've got a single USB-A and headphone jack as well as two USB-C ports. Both of which are enabled for charging. There's also a microSD card slot, though on a machine this size, I wouldn't have been surprised to find full size SD support. I don't mean to keep harping on the size of the thing but it's just a little absurd to see Chrome OS on such a beast. When I asked Lenovo about that contradiction it told me that it sees this first and foremost as a media machine for people who want a big display for things like Netflix and YouTube. That's part of the reason it's got the reversible hinge and it's why the battery probably isn't as big as you'd expect given it's size and weight. The thing is, this isn't the kind laptop you're gonna want to cart around town much so Lenovo expects customers to keep it plugged in more often than not. As for the somewhat limited nature of Chrome OS, Well, as I think I've pointed out in my Pixelbook review there's a whole generation of students now who grew up on Chromebooks. They're comfortable with the software and some of them want to run it on more capable or more specialized hardware. And you know what, I get that. If you're one of those folks or you just want to experience this gargantuan indulgence, you will at least pay less than you would for a Pixelbook. Prices start at $599 for the full HD version with 64 gigs of onboard storage, stretching up to $749 for the 4K model with 128. Lenovo says the Yoga Chromebook, this big bundle of joy should be ready in time for the holidays. This video is brought to you by TunnelBear. True story, it's the first VPN I ever used and I'm genuinely glad to sponsor it. TunnelBear let's you browse the web safely on a public hotspot, which I'm on frequently and it lets you do it with the flick of a switch. TunnelBear even opened itself up to an independent audit to prove it's keeping it's security promises. Mainly though, I've gotta be real I'm here for the mascot.

Is the Yoga Chromebook the kind of thing you'd like to see Mr.Mobile review when he gets back to his Boston studio and far away from echo filled hotel rooms?

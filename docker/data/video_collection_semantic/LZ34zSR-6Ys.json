    "transcript": "- [Krazy Ken] And then if we play that back it does nothing. Oh it plays over here but the... What, am I high? Cannot move clip position, what? Guys, I'm so confused now, what the shit? Error removing clip, why? (bleep) I think it crashed. (countdown tone) (upbeat music) Hey guys, how are you all doing? Really? That's just great. You know, I'm doing pretty great today too because I decided to challenge myself. As a guy that does a lot of video editing I thought it would be fun to try editing in other environments. Like earlier when I edited a video on a 68K Macintosh with Adobe Premier 1, that was fun. What about a Linux system? I have never cut a video in a Linux environment ever. So today for the first time, we're gonna do this together. You're gonna watch me, you're gonna maybe leave comments about how I did things wrong and that'd be great. (laughing) I'm just kidding, I appreciate the help. But yeah, for the first time ever I'm gonna cut a video on Linux with Kdenlive. A lot of people recommended this to me. We're gonna be figuring this out together. I do have assets, yes, I do have assets. The goal is to recreate a scene from Vintage Apple Vault, another show I do. This is gonna be quite the interesting tech video log because for those who have never used Kdenlive, you're gonna be feeling probably the same way I feel. And for those who have used Kdenlive you're gonna enjoy me (bleep) up, I just know it. So initial impressions, the dark interface is pretty as you guys know I have like a fetish for dark mode stuff, so that's good. Traditional track-based editor kind of feel. Video track's there, audio track's there, not too shabby. Looks like we got a render button here. Okay, so it looks like we have bin, that's where our files will go. Timeline where we can edit effects. Some kind of view port. Okay clip monitor, project monitor. Well, I'll be figuring some of this stuff out as it goes. Now, what I like to tell people is tools are just tools, it's the skills you need to develop and once you learn the skills to editing you can learn other software much quicker. Once you know the skills, that's fine. The tools come second. All right, so A001, this is my A-roll so I'm just gonna hit okay on there. Cool, we got our clips. Those loaded really quick. I see a progress bar on here. Is it copying the footage somewhere? Although that path is the same, maybe it was generating audio peaks or something like that. Anyway, so yeah our A001 is there. We should maybe make a bin for that stuff. So I'm gonna move my trusty Apple keyboard over here. Oh boy, we'll just call this Talking Head. Put our A-roll in there. That's pretty easy. So far this is really intuitive. Here's our B-roll. Oh, creating audio thumbnail so it said that down here. Did it just throw that in the folder? Oh crap, it threw it all in that folder. Didn't wanna do that, let's bring that out. And we'd like to scroll down, pop it out there. No, kind of. Let's just undo that. I didn't know it was gonna import into that folder. I was not expecting that. Okay, let's just do a B-roll bin. Select that, add clips. Control + A. There we go now that's separated. Awesome, this is great. Now we have music, sound effects and graphics. I'm just gonna group that into the same bin. I can't open up all these at once 'cause I can't flip them open on the side so I'm gonna have to, actually wait, hang on, I'm an idiot. Can I just select these things and have them import automatically as fol... Oh, this dialog does not accept folders so it is not possible to decide which one to enter. Well whatever guess we'll just do it one thing at a time. So we got the graphics, so that's a little bit of a limiting thing. It's not the end of the world but it would be nice to not have to deal with that. Music, now we just need some music, and there we go okay so I'm probably gonna need to shrink this timeline down a bit. So I'm guessing, can we just drag this? No, so like we can resize that there. Oh so it's probably this thing. Yeah look at that. This is like man discovering fire only way less impressive. And it looks like we have effects and stuff here we can get to that later. I heard there's also scopes, so we could do like some color correction shit in here, that'd be cool. Alright, let's get the basic stuff in here first. So we have our first clip, drag that down there. And does the audio go with it? Oh it does, oh interesting. Okay so it looks like a traditional track based editor, however, I can see these like wave forms in the clip here, they don't show up separately in the audio track. I could probably do split audio, yep, yeah and then it separates down here. Well, that's interesting. That's kind of like a mix of how Final Cut Pro X does it and how premier does it. So I mean I might as well just keep it like that. And then we'll do our second clip here, zoom out a little bit. So we're on a Mac Mini right now, we don't have like a shit ton of horsepower. It's an older Mac Mini but I think we could... I never tried this in Linux but let's try playing it in real time. (video playing) Look's like it's working. No dropped frames or anything so there's that. Let's see, zoom in here a little bit, let's trim that head and tail. Oh there's rewind. There we go. JKL seems to work kind of. The rewinding is a little stuttery, but I don't know that could be the older computer, I really don't know. Let's see, so I could just trim the head and tail by clicking and dragging. That's smooth, but I wonder if there's a shortcut for that. Yeah, I'm sure there's a way to do it. Not sure off the top of my head how to do a trim head shortcut, but we'll just do it manually for now. My head comes in there, we'll trim that right there, drag that to the beginning, move out, trim that tail. There's the slate, the super professional whiteboard slate. (laughing) I don't have my shot log with me so I don't know actually what part of this to keep. Let's see, oh this is a long ass clip. Let me see here, fast forward is there alright. There we go, that's the part I want to talk about. I want to talk about the power button on the G4 cube. So, we got that. Where's my tools? I should probably know where my tools are. Let's see, razor tool X, spacer tool M, selection tool S. Looks like there's different playback options, insert options, okay alright. So I can press X and that gives me my razor blade, okay so right there we'll do our cut, go back to our selection tool, delete that, maybe not. I was pressing the delete backspace button because on the Mac keyboard there's two delete buttons so let's refine that a little bit, zoom in here. So where do you do that with a keyboard? Oh yeah control, control minus but a control shift okay control shift the plus sign control minus. Okay, good to know that. That's good, bad take bad try. Oh audio scrubbing. Now we can find out where I actually said the line correctly, bump that down so it looks like it just snaps right there. Yeah, you can't accidentally punch the clip out so it just kind of snaps right there. I can even drag this down to the audio track that's interesting. If I drag it down the audio, does the video still show up or, it does not okay, that's different. I have not seen an NLE do that exactly. It's my something point, I guess it's supposed to say out point but it looks like it's glitching out. There's a lot of effects stuff in here, this might be interesting to go through. Chroma key, I don't have any green screen stuff with me but it's good that that's in there. GPU effects has no flip down folder. Let's put some B-roll in here right. So, let's see if we can kind of use this like a traditional like track based editor. So if I double click up here, let's see what does that do. So I'm thinking if I double click on this. Alright so we have a clip monitor and the project monitor. The project monitor refers to the timeline, the clip monitor is the stuff I'm loading up from the bin. So I'm guessing what I could do, scrub this, press I for the in point and press O for the outpoint and then just drag this into the timeline, intuitive, look at that. Alright, that's pretty cool. Let's see if we can make this work. (video playing) Let's slide that down a little bit. All right good, I'll scrub back frame by frame, X, get that, select. I did two things and I'm going crazy now. Here we go, shift control Z is redo. I was pressing Control Y, that was probably very dumb. Take that, poof that, I have no idea what the frick I just did now shit. (laughing) I fricked this up. (video playing) Okay really, I really fricked this up shit dude what did I do. And delete that. What the shit did I do. Did I like add a bunch of clips or something? I have no idea. Why is this blue? Now I'm lost, why does this clip extend way out here and there's nothing out here. Oh, I'm really lost now. What the (bleep) is... what happened? Delete, error removing clip. Why? error removing clip. What do you mean error removing clip? (laughing) That's a first, I haven't seen an NLE give me that kind of error before. I've had things like generic error but never something like this. That's weird what if I delete this? This is fine. Okay, so what the frick did I do. Okay, so that's where it ends. Why does this clip like extend way out here. I can't move this either, cannot move clip position. What, guys I'm so confused now. And when I undo it just stays up there. What the shit, I'm confused. Okay, you know what, hang on, there's some other things we should probably change. Like for example we don't even have the frame rate set correctly, it didn't automatically pick up on the 24 FPS frame rate of the clip. If we go to clip properties I'm guessing... Hang on I gotta bump this over. Yeah see 24. Oh that's cool that it shows the video bit rate in there, that's nice. Audio bit rate cool, cool. Yeah, we need to set the project properties different so. (bleep) I think it crashed, I tried disabling that weird clip that just showed up and it crashed. I probably should have saved my work. I bet it didn't, wait I think there is an auto save feature but I don't know if that'll initialize until you give the file and name. Oh, that's not reliable, shit. Well hey, we're gonna fall and get... Oh hang on, wait, auto save files exist. That answers that question. Yes let's recover that. There we go, it recovered now can we delete this thing. There we go. Why the frick couldn't we do that earlier. It must have been glitching out. I mean I felt the crash coming. Wait what the shit. Why is this... Oh I thought it was red because it was giving another error. Sorry now I'm freaking out about the color red. Oh I'm a doofus okay. Yeah, I felt a crash coming, like when stuff just wasn't deleting from the timeline I was like what's going on and then boom it crashed. I felt it coming. Did you feel it? I feel it. Shees, don't go there, sorry. Pause right there, trim that tail, boom Bob's your uncle. Alright, we're gonna control S this, we're gonna call this vintage Apple vault sample edit, Save Changes. Alright cool, now we're cooking with some sort of combustible fuel, maybe a petrol or a gasoline. Let's get some more, b-roll in there. So we're talking about the power button right? Yeah that's glitching out for some reason. It's not rendering the name, it should say in point I think but it's saying, scribble, scribble, scribble, scribble. (laughing) Oops A Daisy little bug or something. Okay so let's scroll around here, we have like a rack focus shot of the disassembled G4 cube power button there. So we'll go in point here, go to when it's in focus, outpoint there, drag this into the timeline, snap it right there and playback. (video playing) Yeah, I'll buy that, I'll buy that for five cents. Alright okay, so let's go here, let's do, let's get this hero shot. In the beginning we have like this dolly shot of the G4 cube being revealed to the world. So let's see insert mode, normal mode insert. Yeah, let's do that so we can analyze key frames. Okay so I was trying to find like an insert. Oh, it did it just by dragging it in, I was looking for a button but it just did it so yeah it made room automatically rippling everything down and it made space for it, cool. Alright, everybody's happy. Now the thing is though, we need to find a way to reverse this. Motion speed, I am speed. Can I do like negative 100%. Looks like we can. So if we do negative 100... punch that into the calculator. There we go, now we're in reverse. So we can do this, we can trim this head, bump that down. And then if we play that back. It does nothing. (laughing) Wait why... Oh it plays over here but the... what, what, am I high? 'Cause like it looks like the clip is over here but it's actually playing over here. What's this blue mean? I thought that was just like a ripple or not a ripple like a gap. Okay, I know what it's doing. Okay, Okay, I see what it tried to do. I don't think it's communicating that very well, but I know what it means it's not... Why the shit. So it's like the clip actually reversed but like the thumbnail is being weird. This looks like a gap but there's actually... or space I think they call it, it looks like an empty space but it's not, that is bizarre. Can I like trim this myself? No, I can't. Can I bump this? Wow okay, so reversing clips I don't know that seems to be working very different than what I would expect. Strange, well for the sake of this demonstration we'll just try to make that work. But at least it plays in the right direction now. It's shot in reverse on purpose just to make the dolly shot easier. I don't want to get into the reasoning why but it's basically just easier to shoot this kind of stuff in reverse. Oh yeah this is definitely bogging down the system now. (laughing) Oh yeah, this is having problems playing now. I could probably render this though but this is still really confusing why the clip is there but the actual footage shows up here. If anyone has an explanation for that I would be very happy to hear it. You know what I say glitch or feature the eternal struggle. Yeah, that's not working out too well. I don't know how I feel about that I'm gonna delete that... Shit, oh (beep). Error removing clip, what? Alright fine let's just delete this. Take this, error removing... Why? what? Oh my gosh do I have to quit you again? Why won't it remove the clip when I hit delete? (sobbing sounds) This is so confused... Hang on let's try this. Open recent valve. Oh now it just leaves a blue gap there, so can I just do remove space. Okay. See that's weird. I relaunched the program and then it lets me delete it. That's got to be a bug. It wouldn't make sense to... Oh wait now... Wait what the... Wait that was the... Yeah, see now it works, what. I don't understand why it would be programmed to do that. I think that's a glitch, it just doesn't know how to delete stuff properly. weird, we're going to pretend that didn't happen. That's misleading though, this dark blue looks... Wait what the (bleep) Hang on that was supposed to get trend. (video playing) Oh, you know what, I wonder if shit got bumped around when I was removing those spaces because it probably doesn't all stay in sync super well. Because now this B-roll is not in sync at all and I guess I can't do a mark key selection. Okay, I'm trying to mark key select that shit, Oh my gosh I gotta hold down Shift to zoom in. That's right, Okay, Okay, well let's just move this stuff back over here. Let's play from here. (video playing) Yeah you know, a bit of a learning curve. I'm sure there's some things I'm screwing up but I'm sure that other issue was a glitch. Let's get some music in here. Oh interesting, Oh yeah, (video making sounds) let's just do I O. (Ken making singing sounds) Bring that here, okay so is there a way to turn down the volume. Do I have to add a volume controller or something? Volume, oh okay so I guess I just drag this onto here. Okay, so you got to add it. I guess that's all right. We bring this down to... If this is mixed to like normalization at zero, I'm not an audio expert but usually I like to have this stuff like mixed where if there's music playing with voiceover and the voiceover is like near zero, maybe minus three to zero decibels, then I usually have the music around like minus 20. So let's just bring that down to minus 20. I don't have my A-roll mixed though yet, so it's going to sound kind of off. (video playing) But it's quieter now so that's cool. So if I mute this... Yeah I have it at minus 20 yet it's still looks like according to the audio meter it's like hitting minus 10. Which shouldn't happen, that shouldn't be possible because the music shouldn't be louder than zero to begin with. But hey, what do I know I, to be honest I don't know 100% how decibels work. I really don't know how that measurement works. Yeah, it looks like it's like minus six even though it's at minus 20 here. What if I brought it back to zero, what would that be? See now that's definitely... It looks like it's clipping, it's in the red so I don't know if it measures differently, but I guess I'll just eyeball it until it hits minus 20, maybe even a little more. Yeah, that's probably around minus 20. Yeah, it sounds kind of quiet though now. But I'm also using a very tiny speaker. (laughing) Control S to save changes, I almost said Command S because that's what I'm used to. So now we have our volume here so let's do volume here and let's take a listen. (video playing) It's about maybe minus seven-ish, crank that up. Let's see if that actually gets near zero. Yeah crank it up probably like more, And now it sounds like it's too loud. Yeah, I think we'll just keep it at that for the sake of the test run. Now, is there a way to copy this property and move it to another clip. Oh paste effects, okay I saw that so I'm gonna do controls. Oh my keyboard's jumping all over, and then paste effects so now... All right now it automatically went on to the other clip now we're cooking with the more combustible fuel. I like it. So we got that going on, control S that sucker. Okay, so now we got some music, some A-roll, and some B-roll. (video playing) (Ken mocking video) Alright let's put some ending graphics on here. So I have this like vault door sequence which is used for like some of the transition stuff in vintage Apple volt, compiled and rendered in 3D encoded with ProRes. Right here Video Coding ProRes. So let's see if we can throw this on here. This is also in 32 bit color, so it has an alpha channel that might not render very well at all. On this computer, well it may render okay, might just be slow, we won't get real time. But it looks like you can see me through the door there. Now I do have to reverse this to make it closed. 'Cause I want it to be like an outro, so I want the door to close on me instead of opening. And as we already know that was being very finicky earlier but we can try. Let's see, what did we do to get there again? Was it under here? Speed. No wait that's audio. Okay so yet, what's this one again? Show all effects. Video effects, audio effects, custom favorite effect descriptions. Well that's just dandy. I wonder if there's a reverse option. No I don't see that, okay so speed. throw it on there. Alright so now let's watch this clip carefully, see if it does anything stupid. Minus 100, okay doesn't look like it did anything stupid so far. I'd say right about there's a safe point. So let's see if we can play this back in real time. Yeah, it's definitely not gonna be in real time, but again it is also, you know an older, slower Mac Mini computer. So yeah there's probably like a preview render option add preview zone, manage cache data. Yeah, so I guess I could render some stuff. Cause I don't have much disk space on here. Honestly I feel kind of stupid, I have three gigs of disk space. So I don't want to be generating render files and shit. Okay, let's put in some sound effects for this big fault door, let's put some sound effects in here. Oh shit this is the watermark version. That's not what I want. Drag that down here and the handle spins. Let's see, handles starts spinning right there, you see it moving. So we can maybe put that right there like that. So let's see, let's get that ambient sound playing, like right around here. I'm just roughing it out I don't need to be super precise for this first test run using Kdenlive. I still haven't figured out how to change the frickin frame right, I need to do that. Settings, download new wipes, I guess you could download templates and shit, alright cool. Full screen mode. Oh shit I'm using that, that's way better. I have no idea, I could probably Google it. I was trying to do this without googling. Whatever we can get back to that if we need to. There, that's kind of sloppy but we'll just leave it that way for now. Maybe I'll come back to it if I feel like it. I wanna have some fun with color. Screw the sound stuff for now, I wanna have some fun with color. Let's see RGB parade, that's usually the scope I use. Where is the scope? There you go, now it shows up. Okay, so here's our parade. Now, I probably won't be able to color grade this super well because I don't have the original ProRes 10 bit data, it's all compressed into H264R8 bit color. But I'm gonna do my best. Boy, I don't really know exactly what I'm looking for. I just want like a color corrector that has like lift and mid tone adjustments. I'm an idiot it's right here, lift, gamma, gain. And it gives me wheels, I love wheels so much, they make things move. Awesome, this is a little more what I was thinking about now 'cause now I can be like all right yeah little shadows, we can just like crush those blacks. It even tells me the IRE down here. That's awesome dude, I don't even think Final Cut Pro does that. Shit dude, that's pretty cool. We'll crush those mid tones and we'll bring those highlights up a bit. And then we'll balance that out. So let's push the highlight... The highlights are a little bluish, green so let's push them toward the pinkish a little bit. We got the red and green balance, but that one with the blue is all (beep) up, so let's balance that out a bit there. Here we go. And let's push that up a little bit. So now we got like a really super dramatic contrasty shot, bring those shadows up maybe bit. Yeah, and the colors balance, so now the white looks white and it really crushed the blacks it looks really dramatic now. And you know if we want we could give a look to it, we could take the gamma and adjust the mid tones to kind of have a bluish haze to it. So now we got like a teal kind of thing going on there, that actually looks pretty cool. I think I'm going to stick with that. That's pretty sweet, we'll save those changes. Cool, that's exactly what I was looking for in terms of color correction perspective. Let's do a comparison view, is there a comparison view? I know there's a preview button. But yeah, before and after, pretty dramatic right. Oh, project settings under the project menu. Well I'll be darned. Let's put them in a 24 p like a good boy. (reading)Changing the profile of your product cannot be undone is record. Shit, that was serious. Well I want it in 24 anyway because I shoot in 24. Does that music end right there? I want that to be like, I thought I had it out here more. I'll try to drag the music clip and it's just moving the play head. Would you stop moving. What the shit. Boy, there's a hand icon. It's like I should be able to grab this clip and just drag it right... nope just going to move the play head. Alright whatever you want, sir. (laughing) What the heck did I do. I'm on the selection tool. This is being a little bitchy. I don't know if it's just having a bad day or if it's a bug but it's being kind of bitchy. I don't know if I could use this as my daily driver. (laughing) Don't plan to though, it is kind of nice though. Yeah I do like the RGB parade reading the IRE down there, that's actually really frickin cool. Yeah, I got to see if Final Cut Pro does that. I don't think it does. Now how did this get way out here? What the shit is this? And let me guess, it won't let me delete it now. I tell you that's got to be a bug, that is the weirdest freakin thing. Relaunch the program again. Oh shit, I think I might have opened it twice now. Nope, it's only open once hooray. Right, let's go back to that project. There's still a cliff way out there, God knows why. Now this is bumped way out here. What? Why is this way out here now? I didn't bump it out there. And I did not move this B-roll. What the shit. Now this B-roll got moved. Oh my gosh, you guys are all witnesses, I did not move that B-roll there. I relaunched the program, and it moved. Did I do something, or is it just moving clips by itself. It's like when I relaunched the program, even with my changes saved, I saved the changes. It doesn't remember where the B-roll clips go, wow. See I don't want to blame the computer, I want to blame myself first but that's really frustrating. Gosh, oh boy, yeah I don't know who to blame for that because that's just that's silly. Oh dude that's not even the part of the clip I was using, it slipped my clip. That's not the part I had you saw. It just randomly slipped from my clip to a different part. Well that's got to be a bug. This is now getting to the point where it's like, I'm able to do some things but it's fundamentally screwing things up. My clips are moving and getting slipped without me actually doing anything. I'm not gonna sweat over that stuff too much right now. Let's just try to see if we can export something, let's at least take this, this is somewhat complete and usable. Is it render? Output file, okay, web M the widespread free format, mp4, the dominating format. Alright, let's do selected zone, mp4, let's just throw it on the desktop. We'll just call it test. Throw it on the desktop, save render to file. It is not rendering. So does that run in the background. I guess it does, the window kind of floats but I'm still able to get to the timeline. While it renders, it looks like so that's okay, I suppose. Can I close this window and get back to the queue? It looks like I can, there's a little render indicator up there. The text is kind of screwed up, the time remaining is overlapping the button. And I can click to show that if I want to and it just runs in the background, that's cool. Adobe Premiere doesn't even export in the background, unless you send it to the Media Encoder, which yeah you could. But built in, without using a separate application. It looks like it just does it in the background, built into the program. So that's pretty cool. Well let's give that 38 more seconds to complete. It totally (beep) up my timeline man. It slipped and moved my clips. Oh bastard, has anyone else had those issues, 'cause I encountered that multiple times just doing this little test. It's like automatically rearranging my clips and that makes me sad actually it makes me furious. (video playing) It takes me four times, four tries to resize the window. What the shit, why is it taking me so many tries to resize the window. I'm clicking and dragging when the frickin icon shows up but... Wow dude, what is with this interface? Now it works, whatever, you guys are just messing with me. You guys watching me right now? you're just screwing with me like we're gonna make it so he can't resize the window and enjoy his pain. Now it works, yeah you assholes. (video playing) Yeah, I probably should have edited that awkward pause out. Yeah, it slipped it, it slipped it. What the shit. Well the B-roll still went in there but it slipped the A-roll. Well, at least we know it exports okay, that was a decent time, considering it's 1080p on an older computer, like that was a decent export time for like 30 seconds or whatever. So yeah, I'm gonna say you were probably like middle of the road on that. Maybe not a full thumbs up. I don't know, maybe you guys have better luck than me but some of those bugs are really weird. But it was still fun to try that for the first time and I'm open to any other Linux software suggestions you guys have for me if you want me to test out anything else. And do stick around because I'll be doing a special Linux project soon, with a little bit of new hardware that has never been on the show before. So stick with me I have some cool stuff coming. Thanks for watching today though guys, really appreciate it. catch the crazy and pass it on. (upbeat music)",

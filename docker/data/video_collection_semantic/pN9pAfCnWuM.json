    "transcript": "hello good people I'm Dmitry and you know I am always excited about new wireless peripherals especially gaming headsets to complete my perfect wireless gaming set and up until now I've been using the cloud flight from HyperX and this has held my the title of my favorite wireless gaming headset so let's see if the new courser HS70 can take its spot right after this the new master liquid ml aia liquid coolers from Coolermaster come in both 120 and 240 millimeter variants now with addressable RGB LEDs both the fans and the pump that can be controlled via this hub with options to adjust the lighting effects and speed along with the ability to control them through the respective motherboard software check out the ML 120 and ML 240 are a iOS down below and before we begin check out our ultimate wireless gaming headset comparison right over here it's pretty epic I guarantee it and of course pricing available for anything in discussed in the video will be linked in the description all right so this is the wireless HS70 following in the footsteps of the HS50 that is my favorite budget pair at only $50 that has this beautiful blend of features build quality sound quality and the age of 70 carries that momentum forward so from a build quality perspective it's a sturdy and the no creek design which is awesome you can flex it without hearing anything moving on the frame we have good size extensions and confident movement on the ear cups for that slight readjustment on your head and from a design perspective it's super simple so basically just an all-black body with this gray thread on the headband that I think is the best-looking one out of the three models available we have a volume control dial and the mic mute button and the microUSB port for charging and the power button on the right side so there is no RGB no glossy plastic sticking out which is I think is a great departure from their previous course avoid RGB headsets now comfort wise I would say it's a comfortable pair the clamping force is just balanced but the ear cups could be slightly thicker to create a better seal but generally the low profile nature and the lightweight nature of the frame means there are no pressure points and while it is about 15 grams heavier than the HS50 I have not experienced any discomfort throughout my two weeks of using this guy now the one thing I appreciate are the audio cues powering on mic on so when you mute the microphone or when you enable surround sound surround on it's awesome to hear that but the most important ones for me has been the auto shutdown feature so if you round the headset when it's going to sleep you'll be able to hear that through the headset which is awesome so you're aware that it is going off and you can turn it back on when you're going to be using it again and I do like that you can set the amount of minutes after which the headset will shut off by itself if there is no audio playing which is awesome to preserve battery life now for connectivity you need to plug in the USB receiver it will work with the PlayStation as well so that's awesome and you can also listen to the headset while it is charging which is great now for wireless range no issues in my space about five to six meters away in my bedroom with two walls in between no interruptions potentially the signal quality may drop but I have not experienced any drops which is awesome now for sound quality I want to compare the HS70 the cloud flight because that has been my favorite wireless headset so far but the HS70 is built better I would say it's more durable in the long term because the cloud flight is a bit more plastic it is lighter which is more comfortable as well but I feel like it's got more rotating joints and the size extensions don't feel as sturdy as the HS70 so in that regard I would say you can be a little bit more rough with this guy then you can with the cloud flight so first the volume output on the HS70 I feel is more powerful versus the cloud flight which is a good thing if you really like loud music but the definition and the overall clarity of the sound signature on the cloud flight is better because with the HS70 I feel like it has a slightly more open sound stage therefore things don't sound as detailed as a really closed sound stage on the cloud flight and I feel like that is by design with the HS70 because it's kind of like a semi-open headset so you can have a bit of sound leakage and you can still hear the external environment you know the isolation on this headset is not a hundred percent but the benefit of this semi-open design is the sound imaging and like this really good directional awareness of your environment so for example with quake champions this whole verticality of gameplay is awesome because you can hear a player above you and anticipate his movement I was able to pinpoint exactly where things were coming from with the HS70 which is awesome you know you can still hear everything with the cloud flight as well but with the hsm of these things are slightly more expanded without sacrificing too much on the detail and which is why the treble on here is slightly boosted now the bass response on these is kind of Airy and flat in the default eq profile we do have the bass boost profile that really does enrich the lower end and makes the whole sound signature a little bit heavier but because these don't create like a super seal around your ears the bass response on the cloud flight is better because the seal is also better and so I would classify the HS70 to be like a technically open sound versus the cloud flight that is more fun but with a closer soundstage now as for surround sound it can only be enabled through the actual software you cannot enable it through the headset itself which I guess is fine you kind of make up your mind to enable it and just forget about it and in here I actually don't mind it it does expand the soundstage so everything feels a bit further away but because of that additional treble you know boost on the high end you still receive a lot of detail and it doesn't sound too muffled so surround sound on here is actually pretty decent now from a battery life perspective I'm pretty happy so they recharge quickly and now and a half to 100% which is awesome and number two they claim 16 hours of battery life so eight hours and one day eight hours next day then recharge which has been sort of my experience the only crappy thing is there is no easily accessible battery life indicator you have to go in the software click settings and only there there's a tiny little battery % it should be nice it was front and center so you know exactly how much battery you have left so you don't run out of juice in the middle of the session alright so what you're hearing now is the microphone from the HS70 it is quite flexible it is also removable but it has no windscreen which is kind of unfortunate for this price point let me just hammer out on some keys these are reds or browns but you know you can still pick them up it does mute the sound there a bit of compression it's not as detailed or clear but for wireless headset I would say it's totally possible and you know you can still hear me and there's good amount of sensitivity on the microphone so I don't have to be yelling into it for you to pick up any volume the cloud flight so this one sounds the same in terms of compression but it has a bit more bass or the sound is a little bit more full in terms of compression of the actual switches you let me know which one you think sounds better in terms of cancelling out those keyboard stuff but this one is a bit more expensive so yes the microphone here is better and this one also has no windscreen on there so it will pick up all the breath yeah all right so to conclude the HS70 is an awesome pair for the price you can pick up the wired version for literally half the price if Wireless is not a priority for you but these will be replacing my cloud flights because they have gotten way too loose over time especially the swivel joints it's great they can sit on your neck but I'm just worried for longevity of something like the cloud flights because the HS70 is just built so much better and I would say they would last longer as well and it will now join my wireless set with the k63 keyboards and the g3 or five mouse the HS70 is now part of the whole wireless family thanks for watching make sure to subscribe and check out this other roland content make sure to check out our new boot sequence channel and we'll see you in the next video",

    "transcript": "what's up good people I'm Dmitry with the crew and we are right now going to visit Silverstone and usually they've had the worst lighting for the entire CES show forever so we're gonna take bets to see if they have actually improved their lighting by maybe including some soft boxes or something so let's see here oh my god the orange you see this orange it's like foreshadowing what we're about to witness alright Eva what do you think they'll have good lighting or no no Michael and I think they will have soft boxes i won all right let's check out what silver still has to offer but first huge thanks to Phantkes Thermaltake Razer MSI and Corsair for making this trip possible and while the guys are shooting the mini case the ITX the LDO3 which has been redesigned based on from last time you saw it at Computex now it slightly bigger so there's more spacing between the GPU and a tempered glass side panel but we want to hear your opinion because their spacing is there would you prefer a mesh panel or a temporal glass panel with the tempered glass panel you can still support like you know RTX 2070 or 200 watt GPUs without adding any additional mesh in there so there's no throttling or would you prefer to go the performance route straight away having a mesh side panel on the GPU side so there is no compromise let us know in the comments side panel solution is made easy with pegs that you push them in so it's a convenient to us assembly and that's where the interior it is an ITX layout with SFX or SFX l power supply that is supported that goes right below the motherboard so there's a bit of dead space in there but it allows for nice airflow channel from bottom to the top so you can install a fan in the bottom you have a nice air cooler and have an exhaust fan on top with a GPU on the side so blower style is sort of recommended for this channel airflow but regular you know triple slot fan design is also not a problem there is an optional 80 moment of fan mount up top so it can suck in all the dead air that the circling around the GPU but of course it is optional you populated if you need extra cooling so yes we were able to set up the lighting to reveal this case the Raven prototype now it's exciting because the last Raven case that the Silverstone launched was in 2014 so quite a while back it's not as ancient as that CPU cooler inside though however we'll give them a pass because it's Hardware Canucks and I mean but this is the Raven prototype and it's cool because they're trying to modernize the frame and modernize the features on the interior to kind of match what the users currently are asking for now in terms of design that has that iconic Raven look it's unmistakably a Silverstone rvz enclosure but now they've made sure to add some tempered glass elements before it was all acrylic they are still not finalized about the you know the ventilation patterns are stuff but I really like this kind of combination between steel I'm really hoping that they might change up the plastic configuration so it doesn't look so plastic II for example but one really cool element about the front is because of the interior layout they want to make the front semi-transparent so you can actually see your graphics cards which is cool I appreciate that so everything is revealed here and at the front we don't normally see that and it would be a cool unique element for the Raven prototype alright so let's go inside and the interior is actually quite interesting and it's not final yet but we'd love to hear your feedback so you know let's get the air flow straight out of the way which is what the Raven series of cases have been known for two massive 180 millimeter air penetrated fans these have been updated so they consume 60% of power of the original so they're more efficient and they run at higher rpm at 1500 rpm and they're they just move massive air columns and that is the perfect thing for the current market I feel like people are gravitating towards air cooling and this is a really good opportunity for Silverstone to like really latch onto that target demographic because of CPU towers are getting so good you don't necessarily need to go towards an all-in-one do it to get good performance and GPU cooling is going to be you know more important than ever with the latest in the hottest graphics cards on the market as you can see we have two graphics cards installed right now it's a fool ATX layout you could install EI TX because we have a little bit of spacing in the bottom looks like GPU clearance will not be an issue and you could install it say some water cooling in the bottom but that would be defeating the purpose of what the Raven series is known for now of course you can see everything on the side the motherboard has been expanded this is not particularly something that I like because I feel like this is kind of a lot of negative space that could be just minimized so you can have this beautiful air column and that is what the case is known for but the power supply has been relocated to over here originally it was somewhere in the front section so I'm hoping they can rotate it and just minimize the spacing but with this configuration we have this rear fan installation and side installation so you could do you know a 240 rad on the back or the side so that is kind of a thing if you want to go with air cooling and do custom loops and stuff but also maybe they could install some hard drive installation in this negative space but let us know what you think about the length of this enclosure I think personally it's a bit too long for my taste I'd prefer something a little bit more compact but people were complaining that the RBZ04 was too compact so where is that middle ground and because of this whole 90 degree rotation for the motherboard all of your i/o connections for the GPU for the motherboard are facing up and therefore have to be routed through the top panel so I'm hoping the top panel design is good it you know it matches to what the Raven here is known for some angular panels that is also modern but that also means that you have to take into account how you route all the stuff through the back and given the massive length of the enclosure I'm hoping that will not be an issue and behind the motherboard tray this is where the magic happens so right now they are still unsure whether to include a full tempered glass side panel here to reveal all your motherboard area but a good thing is they are modernizing the you know cable management sections so they will include low panels here and there to hide all your cables which is awesome I'm really excited to see what their implementation of that will be but maybe they'll include like a tempered glass window over here which would be again great and here plenty of space for all your cables dual SSD caddies and of course these are also compatible with three and a half inch drives so storage is not its strong suit but the whole thing about the Raven Series has always been airflow and I think they're delivering on that promise exactly with this raven prototype now the thing is that price so right now there may be thinking around $200 so let us know what you think about that maybe by the time it rolls out it will be competitive in this in a sense for airflow maybe giving us the best cooling performance for the CPU and the GPU which will be its strong suit but then yeah 200 bucks is still a lot of money especially when there are a lot of good options for that money alright guys so that is the Raven prototype you know a fun fact that my first ever review on Hardware Canucks was a raven silverstone rvz03 so it brings back good memories and its really good to see silverstone upgrading their internal layout cable management while still sticking to that core formula with those air penetrators and keeping up with that 90-degree airflow column so yeah let us know what you think about the raven prototype thanks much for watching and we'll see you next",

    "description": "The only port you need to open on a CML-P (VIRL 2) server is 443. You can telnet to devices using an encrypted, authenticated tunnel using the local breakout tool that comes with CML-P. No need to open lots of port numbers on your firewall. Just open TLS (Port 443) and you can connect remotely to the server. Very nice feature! I like this.  This is Part 5 of my CML-P (VIRL 2) series showing you how to download, install and configure Cisco VIRL 2 (CML-P). The new version of Cisco VIRL allows you to create virtual Cisco networks using just your Web browser. You don't have to use a thick client or any other software - everything is included and everything is easy to use.  The new version of Cisco VIRL 2 is one of your best options for CCNA,  CCNP and CCIE Labs. VIRL 2 has multiple advantages over other platforms such as GNS3 or EVE-NG. VIRL 2 supports an HTML5 web client and contains all the Cisco IOS images. You don't have to use a thick client like you do with GNS3. You don't have to follow a convoluted process to get Cisco images working like you do with EVE-NG.   You don't have to try to find images as they are all included as part of your VIRL subscription and by simply mapping an ISO drive to your virtual machine you can immediately start using all Cisco IOS images in your topologies. Both EVE-NG and GNS3 require that you provide your own IOS images - typically they recommend that you buy a VIRL subscription anyway. That means that you are already paying for VIRL.   VIRL2 is also an official Cisco product - that means that you don't have to worry about any gray legal issues with regards to running Cisco IOS images on your laptop. This is an official Cisco product that is supported by Cisco. By paying your yearly subscription fee of $199, you can use Cisco IOS images such as IOSv, IOSvL2, ASAv, NX-OSv and others without any worries. VIRL 2 has everything you need to get started.  Disadvantages include the requirement to license your installation. That however has been simplified dramatically from previous releases. There is also a 20 node limited in topologies. However, for most of us that is fine for a lot of labs.  Is VIRL better than GNS3 or EVE-NG? In many ways it is. But, all platforms have advantages and disadvantages. If you are studying for your ccie, you many prefer gns3 or eve-ng as they don't limit the number of devices in a topology like virl does. VIRL-PE limits you to 20 devices - so your topologies cannot be massive like they could with gns3 or eve ng. However, if you are studying for your ccna or ccnp, VIRL may be more than enough.  Cisco have made massive changes to their certification programs and it is fantastic to see the new version of VIRL in action.

    "transcript": "- Now before we get into the video, I created this video before this announcement from Cisco. Cisco have announced that the VIRL 2 name is gonna be replaced with the name CML-P, or Cisco Modeling Labs-Personal edition. So I'll be using the name VIRL 2 in this video, because I recorded it before this name change. I'll probably still use that name by mistake 'cause it'll take me a while to get used to the new name CML-P. So just be aware that I've recorded this video before the product has been released. I've got a pre-release version of Cisco VIRL or CML personal edition. Okay, so let's get started. (bright upbeat music) In this video, I'm gonna show you how to use the VIRL 2, breakup tool, which I think is a fantastic feature in Cisco VIRL. One of the things that the VIRL developers have done really well in Cisco VIRL 2 is that you only have to open port 443 on the VIRL server. In other words, you only have to permit SSL or TLS traffic to the VIRL server. You can close all other ports on your firewalls and only permit that one port. But, how do I tell it as an example, or SSH from this Windows computer to my VIRL server, if I've locked down all the ports except Port 443. Well, that's where this local breakout tool gets used. What it allows me to do basically is set up PuTTY sessions, so Telnet sessions, to a local proxy server running on my laptop, and then that proxies or tunnels the session to the VIRL server using TLS. So in this example, I'm running the Cisco VIRL server on my Mac within VMware Fusion. I'm going to run the local breakout tool on the Windows computer, install a piece of software on the Windows computer that sets up this proxy Telnet using PuTTY on my Windows computer to this breakout tool, which then basically tunnels my session using TLS or HTTPS to the VIRL server. So I can load this VIRL server on a server somewhere or in the cloud. And all I need to permit is Port 4432, to that VIRL server, I can set up my console sessions or my VNC sessions to the VIRL server, and only allow Port 443. So again, basically, the breakout tool is a piece of software that I install on my client. It runs locally, I download that software from the VIRL server, install it locally. And then when I set up a session using PuTTY as an example to my local host, it tunnels the session using TLS to the consoles of devices running within VIRL. I think this is a fantastic feature once again, because all I need to permit on my firewalls is Port 443. All other ports can be blocked and I only permit HTTPS traffic to my VIRL server. But I can still connect to multiple consoles on the VIRL server using this local breakout application running locally on my PC. Okay, so let's get started and I'll show you how to set this up on a Windows computer. Where I've got the breakout tool on Windows, the VIRL server on a Mac. The breakout application is supported on Windows, Mac and Linux. (upbeat music) Okay, so once again, Cisco VIRL is running in VMware Fusion on my Mac, I'm gonna connect to the VIRL server from my Windows computer. But just to make the recordings easier for me, I'm going to be controlling that Windows computer using VNC from my Mac, but I am recording locally on the Windows computer so you can see what I'm doing. So firstly, on my Mac, my VIRL server has booted, has IP address 1921681102. Now I'm not currently in my studio in the UK. I'm in South Africa, currently in lockdown because of this virus, these two devices are connected to this little wireless router. So the laptop is connecting via wireless to the VIRL server via this little router. Okay, so the VIRL server has been given IP address 1921681102 via DHCP. Now one of the things I like about VIRL is, can use DHCP. I haven't got a client that's configured to talk to the VIRL server that has to have a static IP address. This can change while I'm traveling. It's not a problem. Okay, so on Windows, I'm going to open Google Chrome and I'm gonna browse to that IP address 192 168 1102. VIRL prompt is displayed. I'm gonna login with my username, admin password, Cisco 123. Now I've shown you in previous videos such as this one, how to get VIRL working. So I'm not gonna show you that here again. I'm assuming in this example that you've got VIRL up and running. So under Tools, I'm going to go to breakout tool. And I'm told briefly what the breakout utility does. So the firewall to breakout utility provides users connectivity to device console ports that are operating in a lab environment. It acts like a local terminal server that embeds the various serial ports/lines into a single HTTPS connection. Console access is done via Telnet and the graphics frame buffer is accessed via the VNC protocol. So we can use our favorite terminal emulators here such as PuTTY or secure CRT to access VIRL devices. Okay, so I'm going to scroll right down to the bottom of this page. And I'm going to download this breakout utility for Windows. As you can see, once again, they've got a Linux utility and a Mac OS utility. But I'm only interested in the windows utility. I wanna keep that executable. Okay, so typically, you would double click on an executable to start it. But that's not what we're going to do here. What I'm going to do is open up a command prompt. I'm gonna go to my Downloads directory, Dir shows me that the application is available in my Downloads directory. If I run the application without any options, I get help information. And I'm told to use either config, init, run or UI. UI is the easiest option to use. And that's what I'm going to use here to show you how to get this application working. So what I need to do is run that executable with the UI option. So I'm going to clear the screen, run the application again, but use UI. And as you can see, we told that the system cannot find this labs yaml file, but it's running a server on the loopback address, Port 8080. Okay, so the next step is to browse using HTTP to the localhost Port 8080. Now, you may get an error here, but don't worry too much about that. What we need to do is configure the breakout tool to use HTTPS. Make sure that you use HTTPS, and then the IP address of the VIRL server. So back on my Mac VIRL server IP address is 1921681102. So on the Windows computer, I'm gonna configure it to use HTTPS 1921681102. I'm not going to verify the certificate because I'm using a self signed certificate here. Now you can populate all the nodes if you want to. Basically, when you enable this, it fetches all available nodes from the controller. Otherwise only started nodes will be included. So you can specify whether you want to include all or only started nodes. For the moment, I'll only include started nodes. The username that I'm using is admin. Password is going to be Cisco 123, console start port, I'm gonna leave everything at defaults. And I'm gonna click Save. The configuration has now been saved. But what you need to do now for things to work is you need to shut down the application. So back in my console, you can see a bunch of stuff has been happening. I'm gonna press Ctrl C, to stop the application. And then I'm gonna run it again. So if you make changes through the GUI, you need to stop the application and then start it up again. You can use a config or CLI option, which is more powerful, but we're not gonna do it that way. We're gonna keep things simple. Okay, it says empty lab list suggest to refresh list from controller. So if I click Refresh there, nothing happens. But notice this option, refresh lab data from controller. Now we seeing no data. And that's probably because we have no node started on the VIRL server. Notice nothing has started here. I see three devices, but they all stopped here three devices, they all stopped. So what I'll do is start my asa lab. So as you can see, these three devices are now starting up. So back on the breakout tool, if I press refresh, okay, so I can see my asa lab. This is the ID. Here's the title. I need to enable the lab. So make sure you click on this. And then you can click on the lab, I can see that this serial port is connected, this serial port is connected, and this serial port is connected. I can see the port numbers that I need to use to access the devices. I can see those port numbers are enabled. So all I need to do now is open up PuTTY, or my favorite terminal emulation application. So you could use secure CRT for this if you wanted to. But I'll just use PuTTY to make it simple. And all I need to do now is connect to localhost. So my local computer, using Telnet on Port 9000. So that's the port that should connect me to my Cisco asa. I'm gonna click Open. And notice, when I press enter, I've connected to the asa running in Cisco VIRL. Now just to prove the point, I'm gonna jump back to my Mac. So on my Mac, I'm gonna open chrome. VIRL is running once again, on this local Mac. I'm gonna browse to 1921681102, which is my VIRL server. Login is admin, Cisco 123. Go to my asa lab. So here's my asa lab. And I'll connect to the console of my asa. Okay, so I'm recording now on my Mac. Notice you'll see the output on the PuTTY session, as well as the console session running within my web browser on my Mac. I'll jump back to the PC now. So show interface, summary as an example. So I typed the command show interface summary. Back on my Mac in Chrome, I can see the output of that command. So basically, this breakout tool is authenticating remote sessions. It's encrypting the traffic and it's multiplexing sessions together. So let's go back to the Windows computer just to show you what's possible. So, once again, that's my asa. What I'll do is open a new PuTTY session, so new session, and I'll connect to the first router so localhost Port 9001 using Telnet. Click Open. And notice there, I'm connected to router one back on my Mac. If I click on the first router, I see the same output on both consoles. I see it in PuTTY and I see on my MAC console running within my browser. Back on the Window's computer, notice what I've got here is I've got a PuTTY session to my router, and I've got a PuTTY session to my asa. So lets start a new session. The connection is Port 9003 on the local host. So, 9003 is Telnet. I'm gonna Telnet to my local host, and click open. And what you'll notice is I've connected to router two. So I'm Telnetting to a local server running on this Window's computer, which is then proxying those sessions across TLS to the VIRL server running on my Window's computer. So, because none of us believe what the developers tell us, let's run Wireshark. And let's capture traffic on the wireless network. So, wifi network, let's see if we can see Telnet traffic. Notice there's no Telnet traffic. Even though I'm Telnetting, to this router, on Cisco VIRL. So I could type my passwords, etc. That information is hidden because it's not using Telnet. But if I search TLS, I can see a lot of traffic between two IP addresses. 192168101 and 192168102. So I can see all this traffic, going between these two IP addresses. We can see it's transport layer security, TLS 1.2, traffic is encrypted, however HTTP over TLS, all of this is encrypted. So I can't see the actual traffic here. It's been encrypted from that PC to this PC. And just to prove it once again, notice the Window's computer has IP address 1921681101. And if I jump back to my VIRL interface, IP address is 1921681101. So it's doing what it's suppose to be doing. Another test we can do, is lets stop the breakout tool. So I'm gonna simply, press control C, on the breakout tool, and if I refresh this page in my browser, nothing's gonna happen because the local proxy has been stopped. And on my PuTTY sessions, notice, I'm losing my PuTTY sessions. PuTTY sessions are disconnected. I've lost my connections to the VIRL devices, because I've closed or stopped the local breakout tool. Now I can still access devices directly, using my web browser. So I could open up a console, and go and access the devices through my web browser. But if you want to use an application, such as secure CRT or Solar-PuTTY, where you can have multiple tabs, then the local breakout tool is great. It allows you to access the devices in your VIRL server using TLS or HTTPS, using a local application such as secure CRT or Solar-PuTTY. So basically, once again, you're Telnetting to a local proxy server, which then tunnels your traffic using TLS, across the internet or whatever link you're using to get you to your VIRL server.

    "transcript": "it is time to change things up just a bit we've uh put together a few fairly expensive builds in q4 2020. figured we'd throw together a fairly affordable budget system that's going to pack a heck of a punch you can see just at first glance here this would be a pretty sweet 1080p and like 1440p gamer and it's gonna cost well under a thousand dollars if you play your cards right and buy used let's get started so to start things off we've got an amd horizon 5 2600 these are going for around 100 bucks maybe a bit more than that i know the markets especially elsewhere like i'm talking elsewhere not the united states but other countries can be pretty screwed up but uh if you can find one of these for about 120 bucks including the stock wraith cooler which is going to save us some money on the on the cooling side of things then buy it if you're in the market for a budget system the ryzen 5 2600 six cores 12 threads pretty decent boost clocks gonna be xmp friendly so most kits of ram should work with this natively and best of all you get to pair it with a fairly cheap b450 motherboard this is a tough gaming b450 plus not the cheapest you could buy you could buy like a pc mate b 350 and update the bios that'd be even cheaper but uh this has nice subtle yellow accents and uh that's going to look nice with our kit of ram oloy warhawk ddr4 modules we reviewed these specifically in this video somewhere up here if you want to check those out but uh yeah they look cool ish maybe in the right build and you have yellow accents and they're fairly cheap about 50 bucks for a 16 gig kit cast latency 16 3 000 megahertz we confirm these will overclock at 3200 megahertz all right now the used graphics card gtx 1080. these are going for around 300 bucks still if you can get lucky find one for about 250 to 260 that i think is a more fair price when seen in light of the new nvidia offerings from ampere which have kind of pushed all of the previous graphics card prices down a bit now of course again the markets are kind of screwed up right now but even if you can find one of these for about 260 to 280 and it's a decent aib this one's kind of just a reference board but uh still it is worth considering in this price range a 1080 is still a great card in late 2020 early 2021. now for storage we've got the one terabyte team group nvme ssd we don't need anything gen four speed because this motherboard the cpu don't support gen 4 uh pci express so sticking with gen 3's good not only from like this performance level you know nvme drives are among the fastest drives out there but also we don't need to spend extra we don't we don't feel uh inclined to spend any more for a pci gen 4 drive because we're not going to see gen 4 speeds so that's why one terabyte will do one terabyte a great starting point nvme drives nowadays are super cheap probably want to buy this new just because yeah i don't know what's been on some of these used drives on ebay and the last two components the power supply first off this is a 600 watt evga it's just an 80 plus white it's not like 80 plus gold or bronze even but it is good enough for a lot of the budget entry-level systems out there you can buy these used although i recommend buying new just because the price like the the price difference between the used and new uh power supplies out there usually aren't too great and you don't know what kinds of loads the use power supplies on the market have experienced so i recommend just buying new you can find 5 600 watts from evga and the like for about 50 bucks or so last we've got the case fractal design mesh if i see what more do i need to say about this this was actually new on newegg recently for about 59 60 bucks somewhere in that range which is incredible for a case of this good i mean if you're in the market for one mid tower you kind of gotta buy it and there is one more thing to consider especially in a budget build that's an operating system windows 10 pro licenses from our sponsor vip std can be purchased for under 20 use our discount code gsl and you can get it for around 15 bucks it makes absolutely no sense to spend 100 or more us dollars on a retail key in a six seven eight hundred dollar build just doesn't make any sense so check out our sponsor link below where you can get that windows 10 pro key for again dirt cheap it's an oem key it'll lock to the hardware specifically with which it's activated uh but i don't know many people swapping out motherboards every other week and worst case just buy another one for another 15 bucks not a huge deal so we're going to show you how to install the operating system at the end of the video but for now i'm going to show you how to assemble all the stuff into a fully functional build already i was really hoping that this board was the one in this box i try to keep these organized but i've got a few and sometimes i like to share boxes so i think for yep if i recall for these wraith coolers we need to remove these brackets screwdriver time let's get these out of here all right so we want to keep the back plates nice that these am4 boards come in the back plate because a lot of coolers use this you don't need to install a backplate like a lot of the uh intel systems out there i think lga 2011 is an exception but uh this here is our ryzen 5 2600 now this has seen um quite it's it's it's experienced right it's been in several systems to date i think this i've chip i don't know i've had this for maybe like two or three years now but uh fairly simple to install here you're gonna pull back on this lever and then we're going to align this little golden triangle here there's a tiny little triangle next to the socket we're just going to drop the cpu in like so it'll really only situate itself one way in here and then we're going to pull back down on the retention lever until it clips in all right now i'm not sure if this cooler has been used before it has because there's no stock thermal paste on there not to worry we've got some thermal compound somewhere in here okay so i've actually got the spreading tool i've already on here this might be a bit too much for this cpu but i'm going to go ahead and manually spread this just so we're sure that thermal paste is everywhere it needs to be the answer to that is pretty much the entire ihs because the ihs is soaking up all of the heat generated by the die underneath and we're just going to apply the cooler like so make sure that those threads are aligned and here comes the cringy part you got to push a little uh a little hard on this cooler here to get these threads to catch some of these coolers yeah like this one here it's just making a god-awful sound bit and that one's good so look folks at the end of the day this is not going to be the best cooler for your cpu of choice but it's an affordable option and it's one that actually works pretty darn good considering how small it is so if you're a baller on a budget using the stock amd cooler and zen zen plus zen two chips is going to be fine okay just chill and we're gonna connect the fan cable to the header labeled cpu fan piece of cake some motherboards won't uh won't boot past the bios load screen unless you have a fan connected to that first header you can of course bypass that in the bios but a lot of people freak out when they see that so i always try to throw it into the cpu fan header if possible all right so we're good there now we need to install a ram it's pretty straightforward so the board itself actually denotes how if you want to show them what this looks like here it's going to look a bit different from border board some boards won't even have this you have to look in the manual but you see where slots a2 and b2 are starred there's little asterisks behind them so that's this slot and this slot they're actually slightly lighter shade of black there we're just going to align the notch on the dim with the notch in the slot push down until you hear clicks on both sides of each slot boom there you go you have to push a little hard here some people freak out they think oh i'm going to break my board i'm going to break my ram but uh they're pretty tight tolerances here that's why people tend to freak out a bit you're okay so i mean like the colors sort of kind of match i think this is about as close as we're gonna get with these uh gold accidents on this oil ram and these kind of oranges well i don't know maybe like it's a yellow what color is that kyle yellow or orange all right it's like it's like a weird in between but i mean it's not bad from a few feet away it'll look like they they kind of kind of kind of sort of work maybe when it comes to m.2 installation there could be one key or two keys this is an nvme drive mostly is gonna be one key you can see it pretty much lines up verbatim that slot there push it all the way in like so and then we're gonna pull it back use that small little screw there let's see this one here to lock it in place this part is a lot easier with a magnetic screwdriver i've seen on forms there's some crap floating around that like magnetic screwdrivers are bad for your system you could like destroy something i mean these magnets are super weak you would need a very strong magnet to screw up anything on those boards so don't be afraid to use one it will keep those screws especially the small screws for the nvme drives from kind of falling around and getting stuck in places they shouldn't all right next up we need to mate the motherboard to the chassis again in this case it's our mesh if i see here slight tinted glass looks pretty darn good we're going to lay the case down right side down i should say and we're going to install our rear i o shield first assuming one is not already pre-installed at the back of our motherboard if one is not pre-installed you'll have a bunch of gaps in here that's when you know to look in your motherboards box for that i o shield so this is what this board's particular rear i shield looks like just a kind of a chrome shiny piece of thin metal and the way to know how to orient this right you're going to see these three holes could be six holes depending on what kind of audio solution you have on your motherboard that's how you know which way to orient this so you're going to insert it from the inside be careful these things don't look like much but they are freaking sharp they'll slice a finger off in the right setting and that's kind of an over exaggeration but you know what i mean they're going to clip it on all four corners that's how you know this thing is in there now once it's in there grab your motherboard by the cooler if you have an ai oh and you haven't installed that yet maybe you can grab it by the edges but the cooler is a surefire way assuming you've installed it correctly we're going to pick up the motherboard swing it into the case there's going to be a central standoff i like to reference this this one actually has one that you don't even need to thread through so it'll kind of poke through the board and that's how we know that our motherboard is where it should be the other holes here the the threads align the holes on the board and we can also check the back and see that all of our ports align with the rear io shield we just installed looking good now we need to screw it down and get these last few screws in here let's see got one up here kyle i fully expect you'll get this shot yeah he's like he's panicking a bit folks panicking a bit all right so we're good we can flip the case upright and uh admire our work so far how does it look kyle looking pretty good solid at this point i like to do a bit of the cable managing the wiring especially these small wires like the front i o wires these are very small and things can get a bit cluttered once we install our power supply so uh yeah that's why i take care of these first just keeps these out of the way and we've got a few holes under the basement here this is where we're going to thread some of these cables through i apologize this is more or less the most boring aspect of pc building the freaking wiring like ow so hd audio is typically going to come all the way over here toward the rear of the case now this right here is the usb 3 header that on this board is at the bottom and connect this cable to this fan header here okay so both fans are connected we're gonna stick with the two stock fans good enough we have one intake fan more or less directed at the graphics card but again the air will kind of find its way out of the other crevices in this case and there's a lot of filtration too in the mesh 5c which is fine and we have one exhaust fan these are both 120s the exhaust fan i get rid of a lot of the heat generated by both the graphics card and the cpu all right now the 600 watt power supply has been through a lot i've used this particular unit multiple times but uh it's nothing pretty right but at the end of the day you shouldn't really prioritize aesthetics over performance in a budget build especially a build that's gonna cost between six and eight hundred bucks we're gonna slide them in through the rear make sure they all come through a few stragglers might be a bit messy at first try to get them to come out here through the back side slide the power supply in just these two thumb screws we're gonna lock things in place we've got eight pin eps some power supplies will just have this split between two four pins typically be labeled cpu or eps we connect that into this eight pin header at the top left of the motherboard north of the socket but there we go all right that's installed yeah you've got the kind of ugly ketchup and mustard cables but you know what again in this price range not a huge deal it's going to pack a heck of a punch for the price now you see we've got a cluster of sata and molex connectors here we don't have any external drives we don't have any rgb led strips any rgb fans any of that so we don't need to connect any of these to anything in the system and that's one of the advantages of having just an nvme drive it's powered directly by the main board so we're going to tuck these in we're going to install the graphics card and we'll pretty much be done with the hardware side of this build now you want to remove the rear pci slot covers and the the two thumb screws that correspond to those that line up with this uppermost 16 lane pcie slot that's where we're going to install our graphics card now we do have one extra slot above that but in this case like the motherboard doesn't have a slot that high the graphics card here again our gtx 1080 oh wait that says 1070. whoops you know what we're just gonna roll with it 1070 is still plenty for this build obviously the 1080 would be better but this actually keeps costs down a bit more and a 1070 is going to be fairly quiet under load not going to get fairly loud and this is a beautiful car i mean this is basically the exact same board everything as the 1080 counterpart actually the same gpu as well just some cores in there have been deactivated they don't they don't pass the mark and that's just what you get with binning now we're going to slide this in see that uppermost 16 lane slot pull back on this little retention arm here for that 16 lane slot and there we go clipper in now this power supply is a daisy chained pair of eight pins for pci supplemental power we just need one it's okay to leave the other disconnected we're going to connect this slide it all the way and make sure it's all the way there connected to the card we'll just kind of tuck this extra eight pin underneath again no problem leaving this disconnected and at this point all we're doing is cable managing fairly subjective how much or how little of this you want to do the meshify c makes it fairly easy so if you the back of your mesh if i see doesn't look very good and you have like you know you're only using like one storage drive no leds or anything like that uh you're just being a bit lazy my friend i hate to say it because it's super easy to keep things looking at least somewhat organized here that's literally all it takes now this unfortunately this usb 3.0 header or the cable is a little too short and the placement of the header on the board just makes it to where we have no choice but to stretch the cable across here and we could use a zip tie to keep this eight pin cable tucked away a bit better but there you go i mean very minimal effort and things look pretty darn good again for a budget system with uh yeah pretty mediocre cables and the way you know that you've properly cable managed unless your case just has awful clearance behind the motherboard tray how easy this right side panel slides on look at that folks i could have done this with one hand it's just piece of cake slides in and out no problem secure it with these captive thumb screws and there we are folks oh that sounded awful swing this build back around yeah it looks a bit dumb with this extra eight pin hanging here but again aesthetics aside this is gonna pack a punch even though we kind of demoted ourselves unintentionally to a 1070. this is still a build that will crush 1080p most games out there except for maybe a few of the very modern titles this might not be uh the best cyberpunk build out there in the 1080p resolution but again for the price it's gonna go a long way now since we talked about the 1080 on the used market we should also talk a bit about the 1070 which is actually in this build you can get these on ebay 1070s not 1080s for about 200 bucks today now a year or two ago i would have said that was a great deal that's a great bargain problem is there's a lot of new stuff out there now competing with it the 1660 ti the 1660 super pretty much trades blows with a 1070 new for a little over 200 so you shouldn't pay more than 200 for a 1070 in 2020 or 2021. that's my take on it in fact i think that the the optimum price like something that's not going to be you know a rip-off for either the seller or the buyer is going to be around 160 to at the most 180 bucks 200 is like the tip of the iceberg if you have a premium aib like an asus strix card now we're gonna install the left side panel here this is just a tempered glass uh panel and we've got four thumb screws to hold it all together what do you think kyle doesn't look too bad pretty clean i need to break down the prices here actually haven't done that we're going to see what we could build this for right now on ebay we're going to include shipping and the like i'm thinking somewhere around seven day like 800 tops but if you had to pay more than 800 for this system right now i'd say you could probably do just as good if not better new and at that point i mean new you get the the full warranty you get peace of mind as well so we're going to fire this thing up and then run a few tests then we'll go on to ebay and just kind of be like our sanity check make sure that we're not overpaying for this i know ebay is pretty whack right now but just in my head i have an ideal price for this we'll see if that actually holds true or not all right so we're gonna ensure that this is switched to the on position this is the power supply at the rear and if we wired things up correctly we push this power button things should turn on good so far we've got our little uh portable monitor there wired up so we should get a post momentarily can be pretty embarrassing if it doesn't there we go there we go that's a post folks now at this point you need an operating system most of you will choose windows and we just released a video detailing step by step how to install windows 10 on your latest machine all you need is a thumb drive like this an internet connection and potentially another system although if you already have the boot tool created you don't need to recreate it for each subsequent install you can take this drive from system to system and install windows every single time without issues so i invite you guys to check out this video here if you are new to the windows installation process again i'm not going to detail it in this video just because it doesn't make sense to go through the exact same thing i just talked about in a dedicated video so check that one out it's also going to be linked below but from there once you boot it into windows the next thing you want to do is activate windows now at this point nothing stopping you from going to newegg or amazon and buying a retail key for 100 bucks 120 bucks even 200 it can get fairly expensive but as i said earlier this in my eyes makes no sense to spend one-fifth one-sixth or one-seventh of your total budget or allocate one-seventh of that total budget to the operating system that you could otherwise use for free microsoft lets you use windows 10 for free without activating at all you just have to deal with a watermark you sometimes can't change your background your wallpaper and there are a few other very niche things usually that you won't have access to with an unactivated copy and this is why i promote the use of oem keys it doesn't make any sense to spend that much on a retail key when at the end of the day all you're really doing is removing that watermark 15 bucks using offer code gsl will get you an oem pro key for windows 10 from our sponsor vip scd key from there it's pretty straightforward just stop into system settings click on the update and security button scroll down to the activation tab and enter your windows 10 pro key here and voila it's literally that simple and no watermark and as we said in our previous build video i use a time spy to more or less kind of gauge where the system stacks up against other submitted results this obviously is not like it's it's not testament okay it's not the only benchmark you could run to show how powerful a system is in fact in some scenarios this system will be better than those that beat us in time spy uh but for this particular synthetic benchmark we scored six thousand and sixty-five it's better than forty three percent of all submitted results now you're greg you're thinking well that's less than that's less than half like that's below the middle of the the scores that are submitted that's not really that great well when you consider the price it's not too bad and check this out we actually reviewed this laptop just recently uh this is the jesus zephyrus m15 which you can check out reviewed up in this card here this has a 1660 ti in it which is about as good as a gtx 1070 and an intel core i7 10 750h okay so that six core 12 thread cpu it's actually pretty close to this thing the ryzen 5 2600 granted this is on the mobile side going to be a bit more thermally limited but the scores are very similar i believe this laptop placed almost identically actually scored almost exactly the same score as well this costs thirteen hundred dollars this costs a lot less benefit of going with a mid tower some instead of something like this which is obviously portable you're paying a bit more for that portability but in terms of performance this is a much better value on the used market and the last thing to do then is price everything out in the build kind of ballpark what it would cost you if you were patient and use sites like ebay for at least the major components so i went through i found some previously sold listings we actually sold today most of these uh like for example this ryzen 5 2600 saying that's in there uh sold for 125 bucks plus 10 shipping i didn't include shipping uh probably have like a 30 40 buffer all in for those components uh the case we bought straight from newegg new because it was so cheap to begin with there's a nine dollar shipping charge there that would be the most expensive thing everything else can be pretty cheap so 125 bucks for the ryzen 5 2600 and then i found a b450f rog strix motherboard sold for 89 and included free shipping it says please read and see photo for actual condition but it actually according to the seller works there were a few decent boards like this selling for under a hundred dollars which i'm kind of surprised by most motherboards tend to be uh listed fairly close to msrp even used uh the ebga gtx 1070 sc that we used in our build this is pretty much the same one except i don't think this one comes with a back plate it sold for 170 bucks and then a 12 shipping charge there so pretty good and we already mentioned the mesh ic but it is still being sold by newegg directly 469.99 which i think is a really great price for a mid tower like this it has excellent airflow great cable management the storage drive we went with that team group mp33 one terabyte nvme uh the reads and writes there about 1800 megabytes per second and 1500 megabytes per second respectively a 90 price tag for this kind of drive though it's a really good value uh for especially a budget build if you want to avoid hard drives and i would try to avoid hard drives at least for the operating system sure a sata ssd will be fine but you're going to get three times and sometimes in this case up to four times uh faster reads and writes than a comparable sata in uh sata m.2 or sata two and a half inch drive so uh consider this one it's also linked below and then lastly the ebj 500 watt 80 plus white power supply 500 watts is enough for this system just it's okay trust me i've done this it was a long time 500 watts just gives you plenty of lead way there the 2600 is going to sip on power the 1070 is a very efficient pasco counterpart uh 500 watts is just right in that sweet spot there and you're only going to pay about 49 bucks for it so under 50 for a solid power supply that i've used many many times haven't had a single issue with any of them yet and the fans actually run fairly quiet even while that power supply is being uh stressed a bit so yeah that's pretty much it oh the oloy kit i forgot about ola kit i don't have it up here but i did include it in the total price breakdown you can get those on newegg for in the mid 50s i've noticed they went up a bit in price since we made our video about them but a 16 gig kit cl 16 3 000 megahertz which is pretty good for zen plus gonna run you about 52 bucks and that brings the total price for the system to just under 700 when you when you factor in shipping uh so without shipping about 660 bucks shouldn't pay more than about 40 dollars all in for these components when they're shipped so about 700 total that ain't bad that also includes the windows 10 pro oem key for 15 bucks by the way i'm not forgetting the activation key so i think for 700 this is a pretty sweet system i've linked all the parts including some of our ebay affiliate links down below if you want to try your look at some bids maybe find some decent buy it now options a lot of people are saying greg why are you building systems like this when there are perfectly fine perfectly suited ampere and rd and a2 cards out there well first off those are different budgets entirely and be very difficult to justify a four or five hundred dollar graphics card in a 700 system and for two just because you can afford something doesn't mean someone else can afford the same we all live differently we all live within our own means we spend money on different things and some people are perfectly fine buying a value-based system like this and look one of the great things about a system like this not many people talk about this is the resale value a bit like buying a used car a car that's already depreciated especially if it's a reliable car these pcs for the most part will last four years yes even the used ones you can get a lot of your money back once you turn this thing around and resell it a year or two later i mean think about it this has already taken a huge depreciation hit because of ampere because of zen three and what's funny is those things you can't even really buy them right now in some countries you can but they're marked up to jesus like you know two three times msrp and in countries like the us you just you don't even you don't even have access to them unless you want to again buy from a scalper on ebay or maybe you're one of the very few who is lucky and finds one in stock for a split second on newegg but um look there there's plenty of value to be found in this price range here in 700 especially if you buy used at least some of the components i mean look not all the components in here are used some of them were purchased new uh but blending them together you know new and used hardware making them work building a balanced system like this for especially 1080p which is still a sweet spot for a vast majority of gamers out there according to steam surveys there's nothing wrong with that we shouldn't train people for trying to maximize value maximize the potential that their dollar has so uh yeah i hope you guys have liked this one hope you enjoyed the build process and stay tuned for something a bit different coming up here in a few weeks it's gonna be probably right after christmas but i'm really excited it's a big project and uh yeah i'm in for it all right give this video a thumbs up that was cool click the subscribe button and i'll catch you next time my name is greg thanks for building with me",

    "transcript": "What's up guys Lew here back with another video and today we're going to be taking an exclusive first look Hands-on with the New Gear S2 You have this brand new user interface which for me is probably the coolest part This bezel around the outside actually spins kind of like those old-school watches that your dad probably Used to wear. Maybe he still does. So starting from the watch face here You can move it to the left hand side to look at your notifications We can then take action on those notifications from that location, now one thing to mention before I get into that you can still navigate through touch like this by swiping back and Forth, but the whole Concept here to keep your hands to keep your fingers off the screen, Okay So here you can see the message and I can take action on it by tapping at which point. I can see the entire Conversation thread then at the very bottom I can click reply from here. There's a couple of different options. What's up? I'll talk to you soon. There's a plus button down at the bottom so if you're like me and you like to use a lot of slang with your friends and whatnot you can put it all in here I'm assuming it's going to be appropriate slang okay Keep it clean kids, but that's not the only option you can also use your voice you can see there's a microphone icon there so you can dictate the message back or If you want to have a little bit more fun to pick a thumbs down because I'm just a downer that day no never mind Thumbs up so we're all about then I can just select it boom now if you're old-school There's even an option using this T9 style input this for me is probably not the most Practical way to interact with it at this point, but hey, it's there maybe you're in some kind of top-secret Environment and you can't get to your phone. You've got this under the table. You know some James bond type stuff So here you'll be able to see that there are tons of different watch faces to choose from in fact There's over 20 right now there'll be an open sdk So people can make their own watch faces by clicking on the stylize button you can get even more variations even in one particular watch face and another cool thing here is that There are custom watch faces for different functions. You can see there's a Nike watch face and that brings me It's actually one of my favorite watch faces here activity bubbles There's two independent Bubbles unfortunately right now You can tell that I've been sitting a little bit too much daily competition with yourself We've seen as before on other activity Trackers and Whatnot But I just thought this was kind of a cool Implementation you see a guy sitting down you see the actual image of it And it makes you feel terrible about yourself. Get up stop feeling terrible. Let's make a change the bands are interchangeable It's kind of just click remove and go from there so rounding out the hardware on the device here on the right hand side you'll notice two buttons this one's going to be used for Back to go back within the interface We've also got a home button to skip all the way back to the main page And then a microphone in this location here on the back of the device you'll notice a sensor This is going to be used to read your heart rate now there are other sensors inside as well Not just heart rate you've also got a gyroscope, accelerometer. It's going to take a little bit to get used to the idea of interacting with the bezel itself this here is for tracking your Liquid intake whether that's water or coffee you can see there's well that could be tea as well Maybe you're in England anybody can like tea simply by tapping The plus button here. Maybe you'll be able to have a better idea of just how over caffeinated you are sixteen cups of coffee a day that would probably kill you right guys the research team has weighed in I Don't know how accurate this is but apparently you can have more coffee than water Let's say the number again How much coffee?.. 31 litres of coffee before you die apparently don't try that at home and Samsung is claiming that this device is going to get between 2 and 3 days of battery life. That's true That's a major leap in the right direction as I think battery life is one of the major drawbacks Smartwatches now when you do go to charge the device you'll be using this little dock, put that on your side table it has four Gigabytes of internal storage that means you're going to be able to take a little bit of music with you Locally right on the watch now Something that's really exciting and I'm personally quite happy about with this device is it's no longer going to be Samsung exclusive operation this will now work with other Android Devices So that gives you a rough idea of the immediate UI but by going to the home screen tapping it twice You'll bring this up these are your apps here's voice memo you also have maps You can use it for navigation as I keep scrolling around you'll see there's this cool animation that happens there So once I get past the first Group of apps now you might be thinking that the app icons on a device this size are incredibly tough to select but with this new UI You can actually sort of just hover over music player in this particular case and then rather than Trying to tap right on that icon you can hit in the middle of the display and this functionality works throughout various menus and different apps So I showed you some of the software functionality also gave you an overview of the hardware, but there's something I haven't covered yet And that's durability since this gadget is a watch it lives on your wrist, and it goes where your wrist goes It's kind of important that the thing is tough and this one features something called IP68 certification That number refers to its durability both from a dust protection standpoint, but also liquid (clinks) So there you have it Completely submerged to make sure it's still working Yeah, no problem perfect, all right, IP 68 as Promised, that's pretty impressive Your watch will not die if you drop it in the toilet. There you have it a Quick look, a first look, a hands-on with the new gear S2 If you guys enjoyed this content make sure to leave a thumbs up down below subscribe for more content like this And I'll catch you on the next episode, Later guys (clinks) I could do that all day",

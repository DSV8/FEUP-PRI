    "transcript": "(upbeat music) Let's go - Hi guys, it's Justine. - Hi, it's Tom and this is Charley. - We just recorded a podcast, and so excited. Thank you so much for being on it. - Thanks Justine, thanks for having Charley and I on the show. We're super excited. We're getting ready to take off into the wild, in our new van. Charley and I just got this new van. And we're gonna go explore America, and I'm gonna be producing and broadcasting my podcast from the van. It's gonna be fun. - I'm gonna put links in the description if you guys will check out the podcast, check out Tom's podcast and his YouTube channel. Like you're making YouTube videos now? - Yeah, I love it. I'm having a lot of fun with the new technology, loving all the new cameras and the new gear that's out there that makes it a lot easier to make really beautiful pictures. - He just got an A7SIII which is very exciting. Charley, Charley Charley Charley. Cool, let's check out the van. - Come here, let me just put you on your, little leash for now. Well, I'm training Charley not to run away. Cause we're gonna be in very remote places so I'm training him to kind of be on... This is a longer leash right now but so soon when we're hanging out the van she's not gonna be able to run off in the woods and get lost. - [Justine] You have a GPS collar on her? - I have a GPS collar on her, she's micro chipped. The thing that's amazing about this van, is its really, these really cool guys from Arizona they make it, they're called Boho. Boho, that's the name of their company. They were on Shark Tank. - No way. - This is a Ram ProMaster Van and they take it and they convert it into a camper. - I this all custom then, you told them what you wanted? - They kind of have been doing this. So, in a lot of ways I kind of like let them take the lead 'cause they know what they're doing, but I did make a few adjustments to certain things for my studio and stuff. The thing that's exciting is like the battery system, I'm gonna be able to go out into... There's solar panels on the roof that are running my electrical system. I'm gonna be able to go in the middle of nowhere and run my recording studio. And I'm recording my album, my comedy country rap album. I call it Comedy Country Rap, it's C.C.RAP, Comedy country rap, I'll be doing that-- - I'm smiling, but you can't see it. It's under there. - It's gonna be fun. Justine, you wanna see my 25 gallon water tank? - Yeah. - Yeah it's nice, right? - Yes, it is. - That's it. That's mine. So you're out in the middle of the desert, your electrical system is powering, pressurizing your water, and you get the idea, and I shower. - [Justine] That's pretty impressive. - Nice shower in the desert. - [Justine] Have you done this kind of extensive camping before? - I've done a lot of outdoors type stuff cause I'm Canadian, I consider myself an outdoors person. As a kid I'd go on a lot of canoe trips very, in depth, sort of deep into the wilderness canoe trips. My father made me go. - [Justine] It happens. - I wanted to skateboard but he said no no, you're not skateboarding all summer. You're going on a canoe trip. This is my grill, see. - [Justine] Sounds like you're prepped. - So there's certain things you need like when you're camping. Like everyone needs an ax for example, right? You need an ax cause you gotta chop your own wood, because you gotta make fire. This is my grill so I could be like cooking, shovel here, fishing rod. Brand new, got it on Amazon. In fact, I got the ax on Amazon too. - [Justine] And you can basically get anything lately. - Pretty much. Pretty much, I got the van on Amazon. - What are you gonna do about food? - So food, let's see here, these are chairs, these are nice little chairs. - [Justine] That's good. - You could kind of imagine what a chair looks like, - [Justine] That's nice. - Folds out and you have a nice little chair. This is a table, this whole table to cook on. Bow saw for more wood chopping. - [Justine] Oh wow! How long have you been planning this? - About three months. Let's just see what's in this one, here. Let me just check what's in it first. Okay, that's safe. All right. - Yeah, but you've got so much snacks. - Yes, it's a lot of snacks. Because you wanna bring a lot of like, non perishable foods, right? Coffee... See below here though, I got lots of fruits and vegetables like corn pineapple. Lots of Clif Bars, pepper... I am being cautious about the pandemic right now. So I'm not gonna be going to restaurants, I'm not gonna be going through McDonald's drive throughs, things like that. I'm gonna go hunker down in the wilderness and I'm just gonna be cooking my own food. I got a fishing rod too for some fresh fish, so it'll be good. - So are you planning on fishing and then eating the fish too? - Yeah, I'll eat the fish yeah. I grew up fishing in Canada. So I'll cook the fish. - Okay 'cause I mean I feel like if I went fishing I'd be like I don't know what to do with this now. - Oh you just... Well, kind of don't wanna get into detail - Yeah. - The adventure of this is also figuring it all out. - Just feel like you're gonna figure out a lot, very quickly. - When you're at a campsite, you can plug in, so you've got unlimited power, right. So you just plug the whole van in this is a 30 amp plug. This will convert a 30 amp into an actual regular wall plug so... In theory, I could plug into an extension cord right here and charge my battery up and we'd run all day. - [Justine] And you said you can last, what like five-six days on the battery? - I'd probably go about six days. What I think you'd think is cool, which-- - [Justine] I think this is all cool. - So I have an app on my phone, Victron is the solar company. So I have a Victron app on my phone, and I can go on there and monitor my battery life. This is my jet boil electric kettle. It is a big battery drainer. This is a bag that you fill with water and you put your clothes in and you soak and you shake it up and it's your little portable washing machine. I have biodegradable soap, right? - [Jenna] Is that the peppermint? - Yeah. - That's the kind I use. - You like that? - Yes its nice. - I've actually never used it before. - Dr. Bronner's? - Yeah. Face masks, very important. - Face masks, gloves for cooking on the fire. You gotta have a good hiking backpack. - [Justine] Do you think you'll do much hiking? - I think so, yeah, I think I will. As you can see, it's my new backpack. I don't know how to open it. Who's the new guy, huh? - Who wants a new bag pack. - Expert survivalist. He can't get in his damn backpack. Bear spray. - [Justine] Very important. - A platypus water bladder. - [Justine] Oh! - So you stick that in your backpack. - [Justine] Yeah those are great-- - As you can see, I've used it a lot. I've been hiking for years, I've used it a lot. I've encountered many bears and drank, and gone on many deep woods hikes, over the years, as you can see. - I'd definitely open the bear spray for you. - Before you ever have to use the Bear Spray, you can use your Bear Horn. And I am frontiersman. Down booties. - [Justine] That's nice. - These are really good thing to wear when you're sleeping. Are you down with my booties? These are good. You like that. Funny, is that funny? I thought it was pretty good. First aid kit. - [Justine] Jenna was very concerned. - [Jenna] Very concerned - Yeah, I've got that. I swear I probably pay for the doorknobs on Jeff Bezos' guesthouse More COVID masks Dog water. - Those are great. - There you go, you like knives? - [Justine] Yes! - Its a Buck knife. (indistinct) - Wanna see it? - I do. I love knives. - Careful its sharp. Be careful. - Okay. - Its sharp. Don't cut yourself. - [Justine] Oh this is so nice. See that was my first question, I was like do you have a knife. And you do, this is great Do you wanna see my knife. - Sure, okay. - [Man] Holy crap. - [Tom] Damn that's like some ninja. - [Man] I'm sorry, how did that happen? - [Justine] Well you have to be very careful or you'll stab yourself. - [Tom] Yeah, don't do that. Whoa, look at that, damn. Mine's just for like cooking and cutting. The Life straw, got that. - [Justine] I think what Peter's saying is you have an open any of your stuff, you haven't opened any of it. - Oh yeah I know. it's like I'm a real expert. Drip coffee, you pour. I'm ready to go. City kid to camping expert, just with an Amazon account just like that. This is a nice knife, you like knives right. - [Justine] I do. - This is another nice knife, Swiss army knife. - You've got all sorts of knives in here. - So, it's good to have. That's good for like when you're fishing and stuff. Now that's cool. - [Justine] So you're thinking long term here. - Yeah, pretty much. - Yeah. - With the new world we're living in I think you gotta find ways of getting out in the world. That's true I should say, this isn't just like a one off thing I'm going to do, as a bit. I'm gonna be out there on the road for the next few years. Come on, my YouTube channel or my Instagram to see where I am, I'll be somewhere out there. - I think it'll be exciting. - Fish bait. - Oh fish bait. - That's some bait for trout, power bait. - Do you think non trout would be into that or is it just specific to trout? - Well its probably good for trout like rainbow trout golden trout yeah like there's... Probably be more for trout, yeah. Like there's a certain fish you... If I was going for fishing for largemouth bass, I wouldn't use that. - [Justine] Is there a largemouth bass bait? - That's more... Yeah, well I probably use like a worm and a spinner. - We used to go fishing with dad, you don't remember? - I hated-- - Hook a little... We would go out at night, we'd be picking the worm. You didn't do that. - I know I didn't. I just didn't like stabbing the worm. - You don't need to use the worm like you an use a rubber worm. That bait has a little scent to it. - [Justine] I don't but I mean I'm just imagining... - The fish are attracted to the scent as much as they are to seeing it. Can I unplug this here? - Yeah I think I'm done stealing you're power now. This looks so cool. - Yeah, this seat obviously is turned around right now but Charley will sit here facing forward, and she's got this booster seat. And it's a seatbelt harness. - [Justine] Yeah, that's so cute. - She'll be up high. In the next day or so I'm converting this into a recording studio. I have a rack with all my audio gear. I'll be able to access my audio gear here, This are some cool Focal studio monitors. - [Justine] So how are you gonna have the whole studio set up? - Gonna have a large electronic keyboard right here. MPC drum machine which I'll either have here or possibly sitting right there. My computer, a couple of microphones, and that's the studio. - [Justine] Its gonna be really cool. - The main components of the studio are gonna be under there. And the idea is to be in the wilderness and just kind of be inspired by nature and trying to be creative. - I think you've got a good space for that. - Yeah, it's gonna be bumping in here, We'll be bumping some crazy C.C.Rap in here. - Good thing you're gonna be in the middle of nowhere. - Yeah-- - So I'm sure if you're at a campground your neighbors will probably be like, \"I'm sorry what are you doing?\" - Excited about it, just the sort of absurdity of it. Being all by myself in the middle of nowhere with this kind of electronics... This is also kind of a nice thing just to see just to imagine, This is a nice fan so it creates nice air circulation. It's got, like, got a guitar here. - [Justine] Is it comfy? - It's totally, it's a really comfortable mattress. I'm like maybe just a little too tall for it but... I'm on an angle like this. No actually, I can, I can, I can fit there, - Plus you're gonna have Charley as well. So that's gonna be a whole another adventure. This is cool. This is what me and Jenna have wanted to do for so long. - This is a potty as well. Some oatmeal, - [Justine] I mean I already had some this morning but like-- - You want some for... - Yeah I'll take it for later - Would you like some? - [Jenna] No I'm okay, I don't wanna take your snacks. You know what i need... I mean I'll take it. - Yeah sure, you can take it home for later or whatever. - [Justine] Do you like Cream of Wheat. - Yeah, it's okay. I'm more of a porridge kinda oatmeal guy. I mean its, its okay. - Yeah its like, it's my favorite. - Yeah its good, I mean I'm not... (indistinct) - I like oatmeal too. I just really like Cream of Wheat. - Yeah its fine. I'm just more of a, this is more my thing. - Yeah its fine, its cool. - I'm of a Quaker Oats. - He's a good guy. - So everyone's just like don't judge right - I mean I'm not, I have no judgment. Zero judgment. - I don't judge. - [Justine] You should tell us what you named the van. - Oh yeah that's right. - And why? There's a whole story behind it. - Yeah, and literally a whole story. It's an incredible novel by the great John Steinbeck \"Travels with Charley: In Search of America.\" In that book he gets a camper van in 1960. It's a real story. He really did it. And he drove across the country and reports on his findings in his van. In that book his dog is named Charley, so I named my dog Charley after Charley and travels with Charley, and his man is Rocinante, and it's written in the exact Spanish script, so it's a little bit of an... Well it's a full on Amish it's not a little Amish - [Justine] So you just recently read it? - Yeah just read it recently, yeah. I really kind of sort of helped inspire a lot of the vibe that I'm finding. Rocinante. Yes, Charley is a good girl. Charley's a good girl. Your shoes, Charley. Charley. - [Justine] Charley. All right, well I guess, I guess this is it. Yeah, I know, it's so great. Thanks Justine, I appreciate you guys coming by. It's great being on the show and-- - [Justine] Thank you so much. - This is gonna be good, I mean. Appreciate the help with the technical stuff because you're an expert in this field and... I've got my new camera I'm excited about but I might be calling you asking, like what's a proxy. - You fixed my proxy problem. - I fixed your proxy problem. - Yes. - Okay. - So now I would be calling you about the proxy's. - Yeah, I fixed Justine's proxy problem. - I fixed other problems for you but the proxy one you've solved. - Yeah, I appreciate it - But I'm here for all of your tech assistance. I'm so excited about your trip. Guys make sure you go check out everything that Tom is doing, it's so incredible. I mean, you basically revolutionize everything that everyone is doing now. So to see you going out and just embracing this-- - I'm just older than everybody else. - Well, you learn a lot. - No, it's fun, it's this is exciting time. And I'm still enjoying all the new tech that's coming out and so much easier to do cool stuff now for everybody. - Yeah. - Just to be able to, everyone has access to a camera now. It's exciting time and wouldn't make sense to not embrace that and enjoy it and keep having fun with tech, so thanks everybody. - See you guys on the internet, Bye - Bye internet. - See ya. - Bye bye internet. - Bye. - Bye.

    "transcript": "- Today, we are going on a Safari to find 5G but not just any 5G, the elusive 5G ultra wide band. If you think that you can go on an adventure without going to REI to get some gear. You are wrong. (instrumental music) This one says Explorer on it. You know what, my phone has a compass. That's free. Well, not free. Oh my God. These are actually really good. I'm looking in the wrong end. (laughing) We're going to find it today. 5G, you're not even going to be safe with me around. I need to go to the Verizon store to see if I can get a map A map of 5G. I just had a question about 5G. - [Verizon Worker] 5G. Okay - Yes. Do you have like a 5G map? or like something... - [Verizon Worker] Yeah we do, its actually on our website and it shows you basically all the spots that we have available for 5G. - Even like the ultra wide band? - [Verizon Worker] Yes. Across the street, literally crossing the street you can get 5G service. - Really? Because I have LTE right now. - [Verizon Worker] Right, yeah. So, when you cross the... across the street right over there by the... - I'm on the hunt for it. Okay. I'll try that. All right. Thank you. I have it. 2,336 download. The hunt must go on. There's a common misconception that all 5G is the same and that's not quite true. 5G Ultra Wideband is much, much faster than 5G. As we're seeing here, I'm getting 2,336 down right in this very spot. The 5G Ultra Wideband uses ultra wide millimeter wave technology which is much faster than the regular 5G. We must continue the search. Let's go. (dramatic instrumental music) 5GW, we have found, we have found some on this road. Anybody else here? Anybody else seen it? 5G is so fast. Do you see this? 109 upload right now. Right now, I'm getting 109 upload There's Spider man over there. Is somebody else filming something? Why is Spider man here? I was like, is he filming the video? He probably thinks I'm crazy. Let's see if we can find faster. (police sirens) Oh no, they found me. I have it. We got it. We got it. We gotta pull over. We gotta pull over. We gotta pull over. We gotta pull over. We have a sighting. We have a sighting. We've got a sighting. Let's get out. We've got to get out. We have to go. I have it. I've got it again. Look, oh, this is a good one. Okay. It's not quite as good as our previous find, but I'm very happy with our results. Yo, you guys got 5G over there or what? Jenna has just picked up. She has joined the party. I got to get that ghillie suit on Ed. I'll see you all soon. We're slowly losing light. Which really means nothing because 5G works in the day and the night. It doesn't matter. (Dramatic instrumental music) Good thing it's getting dark out and good thing that 5G isn't nocturnal, or it just is all the time. You know. Look at this, one size fits all. Oh, no one is going to even know that I'm here. Do I still have to wear my mask under here? God, I was cold, and now I'm hot. It was like, yes. And then it was no. And then it was 5G. And then 5GUW. Now, I can't see or walk. (dramatic instrumental music) I am a person. (laughing) We have 5G, but not Ultra Wideband. And that's what we need. I didn't come searching out here just for this regular 5G. I need the good stuff. I'm going to go. I'm to go over here. (instrumental music) Oh man, face ID isn't working. Hi, it's mommy, it's mommy, it's mommy. - Maddie, I think that's your mother. - Hi, Maddie. Hi it's mommy. I've got a Ghillie suit on, I've got a Ghillie suit. Wow. This is something that we just did. So, I had so much fun going out and searching for 5GUW and I'm honestly incredibly shocked at how fast it is. Do you guys remember when this happened? 2,494 download. 5G Ultra Wideband. So, this is really exciting for the future, and I feel like 5G is here, but it's not entirely here and ready. 5G is the future. And sure enough, I got to experience that here today and I cannot wait until 5GUW is everywhere. What do you think Maddie? Do you like 5G? I think you would like 5G, it's real fast. 5GUW. See you guys later. (instrumental music)",

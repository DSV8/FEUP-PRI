    "transcript": "Hi There, this is Mrinal once again and welcome to RTT videocast. In todays video, we will see, 5 super useful tasker profiles. Most of you, may already know about tasker : But to make sure everybody's on the same page. This is what you need to know-- By definition, Tasker is an automation app. You can use it to trigger actions based on certain events. But if you ask me, then tasker can do much more than that. For instance: You can even make an fully functional android app with tasker It available on Google play for approximately $3. But you can also get the 7 days trial version, from its official website. Before we start, here are few things to keep in mind. Watch this video in your free time. This tutorial is long and you will learn a lot. So make sure are in a right state to process all this information. 2. This video is for both, beginners and intermediate taskers user. However it will be better if you familiar with its interface. 3. All download links, videos timestamps and future resources are available in the video description. 4. Finally for best experience- Watch this video on HD and turn ON subtitles. And that being said, lets get started. Profile no 1. Say Whatsapp Notification Lets say you are driving or busy doing something and then you received a WhatsApp message. In most cases, you will either ignore the message or stop your work to read it. Right ? But with tasker can do this.. Cool, Isn't it ? Now see how to do that ? Open your tasker app and under profile, choose a trigger for your task. goto event > search for notification > and select any app you want. For this instance, our trigger is WhatsApp notification. But you can also choose Google voice, hangout or even Facebook if you want. Once done > go back to save changes. And now you need to specify, what task you would like to perform when you get WhatsApp notification, So create a new task, and give it any name you want. Here I will name it , speak WhatsApp messages. Once you done, tap on the check mark and you will be redirected to task tab. Now we are ready, to add our first actions. Since we want to speak our WhatsApp notification > search for say command. Under the text field -> select inbuilt variable called ntitle short for notification title. For now you can leave rest of things as default, and go back, to save changes. Now lets test it. And as you can see its working fine. But you can make it even better. For instance, I only want to hear notification, when display is off. So I will add this as, another trigger. Now only when both condition are true, it will launch the task. Second thing that I like to do, instead of speaking the senders name, I like to hear its morse code. In this way its more fun and also avoid eavesdropping. So head over to your task, and use variable spit to extract the sender's name. Under name select, %ntitle and For the splitter action use space Keep the rest as default and go back to save changes. Now we know, by default, whatsapp say the words Message from senders name This means, our senders name will get store in the variable ntitle3, To convert this into its equivalent morse code. Search for morse and select the variable ntitle3. Now when we will get WhatsApp message, it will look something like this. Profile 2. Change wallpaper Automatically So Lately, I am using this wallpaper app, by Garav mantri. It has some great collection of minimal wallpaper. However! every time I want to change the wallpaper, I have to do it manually. But with tasker you can automate this as well. So let see how this is done. Start by collecting, all images under the same folder. For this instance, I will extract images from the apk, but you can choose any images you want. Next, use the batch rename option of ES file Explorer, to make sure, names are in sequence and have same file extension. Once you are done, copy the file location. And head over to tasker app. For this profile, we will use time as a trigger. So set the time you like, and then choose, how often would you like to, repeat this. Let say every 2 hours. Now go back and save changes. You can also Add, another context of display off like we did in the previous profile. But for now I will leave it like this and create a new task for it. Lets name it change wallpaper. For this task. Our First action is to generate a random no. For that, will use Variable randomize Give any name to your variable but make sure its start with capital letter or you want be able to access it, outside this task. Start value is 1 , while end is equal no. of images you have. Second action is to add wallpaper. So tap on the plus sign and search for set wallpaper. Here enter the path of the folder, followed by the filename and random variable. now again, go back to save changes And thats it, you will see new wallpaper every now and then. 3. Everyone loves privacy. However its hard to find these days. So let say your friend ask for your phone, saying that he want to check something on the internet. And as soon as turn away, he started exploring your whatsapp message or check out call history. But with this tasker profile - Whenever, they open your personal app, it will automatically closed with an alert message. This way, you can kill two bird with single shot. First they wont see your personal stuff And second you will get to know their real intentions So how do we do it ? Well like always, head over to your tasker and create a new trigger. Choose apps that you want to block. And go back and save changes. Now create a new task for this profile, lets called it, Private mode. Add the first action to - go home. This will bring up the home screen, whenever the restricted app is open. Next add a notification sound. And finally, you can flash text like unexpected error or something However If you have plan to use this profile quite a lot, then make sure the suspect dont know you use tasker. Or else he can simply force quit tasker and use the restricted app. If your phone is rooted, you can even hide your notification and default keyboard. There is an awesome video about it, by Tech Muggles. Check that out. Profile 4. Pomodoro Timer The night before making this video, I was reading Eat that frog by brian tracy And it gave me the idea of pomodoro mode with tasker. Pomodoro timer are popular and you may already know about it. But for those who dont: Basically its a technique, to increase your productivity and get your work done is less time. And this is how it works. You set an alarm for 25 min. During this 25 mins you focus on your work, no facebook, reddit or whatsapp. After the 25 min is over, you take a 5 min break and then come back and repeat this 25 min cycle. So lets see this in action. When I am in the office, I tap my device over this NFC tag. It start the 25 min timer, cuts of all notification, After 25 min, it say take 5 min break. For this project, you will need, NFC enable smartphone some NFC tags, (if you dont have one, then look online. They are quite cheap, if you are new to this then check out my playlist on NFC ) And you will also need other apps like Auto notification, Trigger and tasker , all available on Google play. So lets see how this is done. Download and install Auto Notification from play store and add create a new profile with notification you want to disable. Now like always, Open tasker and create a new task. Let called it Pomodoro mode. To save some, I will import my existing task and explain it to your step by step. First and second action, will display notification and speak out, Pomodoro mode active, Work now Third action will turn off all notification. For this we will use the no notification profile that we have just created. In forth action, we will start the actual timer and wait for 25 mins. After we have work for 25 min, we deserve a break, so 6th and 7th action will popup a message Take 5 min break And after waiting for 5 mins. Next action will say, tap your phone to NFC to activate pomodoro ANd finally revert the changes, by turning on, our notification service. Thats it. Now to write this task to your NFC tags. You can use tasker plugin called NFC locale. But since its paid, I suggest use the its free alternative Install trigger from Google play and open it. create a new task > add nfc as trigger. You can even customize it more, but for now, we dont need to. Once you see option to add tasker. click on the small magnifying glass to add the pomodoro mode. Save changes. And thats it. Now you can do more work in less time. 5. And finally the last one is not particularly useful but its funny. If you have nosy sibling, fiddling with your phone, when you are not around. Then this profile will help you to discourage them. So let see this in action. When there are multiple, unsuccessful login attempts, your device will take a discrete picture, then set it up as wallpaper and will also give a warning. Now lets see how to do it. You will need a tasker plugin called secure settings. Although this plugin require root access, for most of this task but. For this one, you dont have to be rooted. Once you have install the plugin. Make sure, it has access to your screen lock. Now open tasker, In the profile tab, select the trigger as secure settings. Configure it by selecting Failed Login Attempts and set the value more than 4. Save changes and go back. Next create a new task, lets called it take picture, set wallpaper. Add first action, to take picture. In the setting, select front cam, Give it a name, let say pic. Make sure to check mark, insert in gallery and discreet options. Go back to save changes. Next set the photo as wallpaper. By default tasker save the picture, in DCIM folder. Use the say command to make it speak somthing funny. Add give a alert message if you want. And you are all set. You can even use this profile to catch thief. By syncing your photo to google+ and sending you a text with gps location. But for now we will leave it here only. Well this is all for now, there are few more profiles that I was not able to include in this video, instead I will post them on my blog. And if you find this video helpful, then be sure to like this video. Seriously guys my last video on tasker, got 50 dislike. And it would be awesome if I can get more likes this time.

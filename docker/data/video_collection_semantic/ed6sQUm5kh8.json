    "description": "LG Gram 15 current pricing and specs:  This laptop WAS provided to me by LG - Opinions and Tests are my own.   In this video I take one of the worlds lightest laptops and put it through a series of durability tests. First the build quality test, seeing what materials the laptop is made from. Second I put it through a drop test, and finally a 200 pound crush test.  If a laptop can survive these three events, I would consider it durable.   What tests should be included with the next laptop? Should I drop it 5 times instead of 3?  What laptop should I test next?

    "transcript": "Today were going to something a little bit different. This is the first video in a series of videos about laptop durability. Normally I deal with cell phones, but laptops are portable as well, and still suffer the same amount of abuse being toted around everywhere. LG was brave enough to send me the LG Gram, one of the thinnest and lightest laptops in existence while boasting some pretty powerful specs. Ill leave a link down in the video description if you want to check out some of those specs. But this video is going to be about durability. Lets get started. [Intro] This brand new 15 inch lap top from LG is one of the lightest and most portable laptops on the planet, weighing in at just 2.2 pounds, which is considerably lighter than Apples new Mac Book Pro which lands at just over 3 pounds. Now when talking about the exterior surface material, LG says it is a nano carbon magnesium alloy, which at my first impression legitimately had the look and feel of cold metal right out of the box, and even has the same metallic sound weve all come to love. But when I get out the razor blade and dig a little deeper through that top metallic coating, there is plastic material underneath. Now this doesnt bother me too much on a laptop. This laptop was specifically built to be light, portable, and powerful, and theyve accomplished that. My level 3 Mohs pick tells us that this laptop has a 7th generation i7 processor, with 16 gigabytes of RAM, and a huge 512 gigabyte SSD hard drive. LG said that these nano carbon metallic powders on the surface improve the laptops strengths by 26 percent, but well have to test that out in a minute. The keyboard is also plastic, and thats normal. I cant think of a single laptop keyboard with metal keys. If you know of one let me know about it in the comments. So when I was first thinking about doing durability tests on laptops besides just build quality checks, I tweeted it out and there was some really good suggestions from you guys, the most relevant of which I think is the drop test because thats probably what happens most to laptopsyou know, being dropped off a table or being dropped out of a backpack. For me personally, anytime Ive almost damaged a laptop is when its been plugged in and sitting on a table and someone walks by and accidentally like kicks that cable and pulls the laptop off the table. Luckily with the LG Gram, they are boasting a 12 hour battery life which is pretty impressive. So I imagine its not going to be plugged in a whole lot, but just for the sake of continuity across all of my laptop tests, were going to do this one plugged into the wall. Youve got to admit that this is a pretty good looking laptop. Its got the super thin bezels on the side, its got the touch lit keypad, and its got enough ports its almost like LG wants you to be productive with their laptop. So right now the laptop is on and completely functioning. Its a brand new laptop, there are a couple scratches but thats not going to affect the build quality. So were going to do this three times. Im going to stand up and trip over this cable, which I think is the most common drop that happens with laptops. Alright. Still functioning. Drop number one. Lets attempt drop number two same cable. Drop number two still completely functioning. Its almost like this laptop is so light that theres no weight. Theres not enough weight to actually damage any of the internal components or the screen hinge or anything. This is the third drop. Im going to open up the laptop as far as it will go and drop it one more time. And still nothing wrong with the laptop still functioning completely. The last thing Im going to do is the crush test because we know laptops are mostly in backpacks or book bags, and sometimes they get leaned up against you on the subway or the bus or in your car. So Im going to close the laptop and stand on it. Now I weight about 200 pounds, so if this thing can survive a crush test of 200 pounds, it can probably survive anybody leaning up against it. Okay here we go. Stepping on a laptop all of my weight directly on top of it. Lets see if it still works. Ohhh, that is awesome. There is no crack at all in the screen. I think were good to go. Lets double check. Oh, that is amazing. So even after being stepped on with 200 pounds of pressure, the screen is still completely functioning and nothing is wrong with the laptop. I think thats pretty impressive. Let me know if there are any other tests that I should do in my laptop series. Leave them down in the comments below and I will read them. I will also leave a link in the description of this video for this laptop. If it can survive three drops and 200 pounds of pressure, I would consider it pretty durable. It would be interesting to see how big the battery is inside of this laptop when I do my teardown. Thanks a ton for watching. Ill see you around.",

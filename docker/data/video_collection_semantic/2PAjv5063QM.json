    "transcript": "- Welcome to \"The Vergecast,\" the flagship podcast of Corporate in Fighting. I'm your friend, David Pierce, and I am sitting on my back patio getting the grill ready because it is July 4th weekend, and that's just what you do. This is America. It's July 4th. It's also my birthday on July 4th, and so we sit outside, and we grill, even though it's very hot and there's mosquitoes everywhere, and would I rather be inside in the air conditioning looking at my television? Yes, but it's July 4th, so we're grilling stuff. Anyway, we have an awesome episode coming up for you today. We are going to basically start a tech company together. Nilay Patel, Alex Cranz, and I are going to, as a group of CEOs, which couldn't possibly go poorly, figure out how we would build a tech company out of the tech industry as it exists. Now, it sounds a little complicated, but I'll explain the rules when we get into it. It'll all make sense, but basically I wanted to see if you were to start from scratch and say, \"Okay, what are the best products in tech? What can I take? What can I put together? What could we build that would be cool and different and that we could make awesome? How would we do that?\" We had a lot of fun putting this together and figured this would be a fun time to do it. It's July. The news is a little bit slow. We're about to get into Crazy Gadget season again, but it felt like a fun way to take a different kinda look at the tech industry. I should also say some credit for this whole concept goes to a podcast I really like called \"The Big Picture,\" really good show about movies, and they did one recently where the two of them started their own studios together, and they kind of did a draft and picked actors and writers and it was a very fun episode, and so I just kind of stole that concept, and we're going to take it and turn it and do something similar on the show today. So we're gonna start a tech company. I'm very curious what you think as you listen to it. If you think we made bad decisions, if you think we made good decisions, if you think we're monsters, I wanna hear everything. Call the hotline. 866-VERGE11 Email us vergecast@theverge.com. Tell us how you'd start a tech company and maybe between us we're gonna take over the tech industry. It's gonna be awesome. Anyway, all of that is coming up in just a second, but first I just noticed that I turned the grill on without actually turning the propane on. So this is how good I am at grilling. I'm gonna go fix that problem. This is \"The Vergecast.\" We'll be right back. (upbeat music) All right, we're back. Let's go. Nilay Patel, hello. - [Nilay] Hello. - [David] Alex Cranz, hello. - [Alex] Hello. I'm excited to be a CEO today, right? - [David] Thank you both for coming to maybe the most convoluted, insane game I have yet devised podcast, but I'm very excited about this. So the structure of this is basically as follows. We the three hosts are now co-CEOs of a tech company because I would say historically speaking, companies with three CEOs tend to be the most successful. - [Nilay] Yeah, it's like Blackberry, but a little bit more, you know? - [Alex] Just like. (Alex laughing) - [David] What if you added one more person who had some weird ideas and wanted to own a hockey team? It could be great, and we are going to build our own company out of parts of other companies is essentially how this is gonna work. So I have, I think it's either 10 or 11 categories here that we as as a tech company, are going to enter by taking that product from another company. There are several rules. Again, this is very convoluted. - [Nilay] Yeah. - [David] But it's gonna work. It's gonna be fine once we get into it. Everything we take from a tech company, we get, as it exists right now, whatever it's selling, whoever it is that makes it, all the factory deals, all the marketing stuff, everything. We can change it as we like, but we get, we don't get the idea of it. We get the thing as it is right now. We only care about things up to 2030. After that, who knows? We're all gonna live on Mars. So we're playing like a six year long game here, and frankly, if we as the triumvirate of CEOs last until 2030, we will have been wildly successful. - [Alex] I'm banking out really fast. - [David] Yeah. - [Alex] As soon as we IPO I'm gone. I'm sorry. - [David] Alex is resting investing from like day one here. (Alex laughing) It's gonna be great. We can spend as much money as we want, but making money is not the point. We're actually not gonna talk about money at all on this show. - [Alex] Okay. - [David] We don't wanna go out of business, but our main goal is just to build the greatest tech company in the history of the universe. Like that is what we're after here because this is like, if we start talking about the money side of things, it just gets weird and complicated in ways that we don't have time for. - [Nilay] That's what we're gonna tell our investors. We're just gonna be like, \"Look guys, if we talk about money, this is gonna get weird and complicated.\" - [David] Yeah. - [Nilay] \"So just, you just relax.\" - [Alex] We're just out to make an AGI. Don't worry about it, guys. - [David] Yeah, like for 20 years Jeff Bezos was like, \"I can make money whenever I feel like it, for now I'm just gonna like make cool stuff.\" Like that's the vibe at our tech company, and I would say the two most important things as we pick here are we can only take one product from each company. So once we have used something from Apple, we cannot use anything else from Apple or Samsung or Google or whoever else. One product per company, which I think is gonna be very complicated. That product also cannot be the whole company. So if there is a company that makes a single product with its name, like I originally had Figma in one of our categories as like a thing we might want to take, but if you take Figma from Figma, there is no Figma anymore. So that doesn't count. - [Nilay] Well what about, what about fig jam? (David laughing) - [David] Sure. - [Nilay] Now moving right along. - [David] Yes. Sure. - [Alex] That's actually. (Alex laughing) - [David] I'll give you that. Another one I had is like, oh, here's a good example. Like we can't take Salesforce from Salesforce, but we could take Slack from Salesforce. - [Nilay] Oh, I see. So if Apple had a product called Apple, you would just be like, no. - [David] That accounted for, you know, 98% of its revenue, yeah. So, sure. I guess under that rule we can take fig jam, (David, Nilay laughing) I'll add fig jam back to the list, and most importantly, this is not competitive. We are three CEOs. We are doing this together, and so we have to agree on everything that we're going to take, which I assume means this is going to take 12 hours. - [Alex] Is there such thing as a hung jury in this situation? - [David] No, because there are three of us and if it comes to it, we will vote and two to one will win. This is why we have three CEOs. - [Alex] Yeah. - [David] This is, it's a perfect, I can't believe no one has thought of this before. - [Alex] Yeah. Why are people doing one and two? - [David] Odd number CEOs solves all your problems. - [Nilay] Yeah. - [Alex] Yeah. - [David] Okay. Here are the categories. We're gonna do smartphones, tablets, and PCs. Then we're gonna take a break. We're gonna do wearables, headphones, app platforms, which is not specific apps, but think of like app businesses, like Microsoft Office is one of the options in that category, and then we're going to do what I have called boring B2B money faucets, which is the thing that makes you all the money that nobody ever wants to talk about. Then we're gonna take another break, and then we're gonna do messaging, streaming service, wild card gadgets, and wild card everything else, and then we're gonna get outta here and we're gonna go be filthy rich. Sound good? - [Alex] I'm so excited to be rich. - [David] All right. Category number one is smartphones. This to me is maybe the easiest, but also maybe the most difficult one to do first, which is why I wanted it to do it first. - [Alex] See, I also agree with you 'cause I think we're probably along the same lines for what the phone should be. - [Nilay] Well, it, the only thing that makes it different is David told us not to worry about money. - [David] Oh, interesting. - [Alex] We don't worry about money. - [Nilay] Well, if you give one wit about money, you take the iPhone. - [David] Yes. - [Alex] Right. - [Nilay] Right, because then you then now you funded whatever other boondoggles you want to get on, like. - [Alex] Yeah. (David laughing) - [Nilay] Then we can pick the KOBO for tablets and it's fine. - [Alex] That's what we should do. Exactly. You're right on the same wave link. - [Nilay] But if you don't care about money, then you might have a substantive discussion about what phone you want. - [David] Well, so, okay, let me, let me frame this slightly differently. We don't care, we are not spending our time thinking about quarterly earnings and shareholder value, but we do wanna win, right, in like big picture win. - [Nilay] Then we're taking the iPhone. - [Alex] Yeah. - [Nilay] I've already, I've crushed you. - [Alex] We're taking the iPhone. We win. - [David] I think that's right. I think the only reason for me that the iPhone is challenging is that there are a lot of categories here in which Apple is also very good and some in which it has a lot less competition. - [Nilay] Oh no, no, I can, every other category I can, I can defeat everyone else with the power of the iPhones lock-in. - [David] Oh, interesting. - [Nilay] Do you trust me? You just wait. Am I'm allowed to change stuff? - [David] Yeah, we're good. We nailed it. It's fine. Oh my God. I just realized we're gonna speed run building an app tax out of. - [Nilay] ] Yeah, it's gonna go so fast. You think I don't care about money, David. (Alex laughing) 45%. Let's go. - [David] Yeah, somewhere Lina Kahn just started listening to this, and she's like, \"This is,\" she's like, \"This isn't the tech company I would've built.\" (David laughing) - [Alex] We're not even gonna be allowed to make a company. Lina Kahn's like, \"Nope. No, not this.\" - [Nilay] Your fake company is illegal, sir. (Alex laughing) - [David] Okay, but just for this, for the sake of argument, the other nominees that I had here were Samsung, which I think is probably the only other reasonable competitor here. The Google Pixel. If you're, you know, feeling good about yourself, the Nothing Phone, which is a fun, like dark horse if you wanna like bet on doing something weird and cool in the next six years until 2030. Interesting bet. Huawei One+, ASUS Motorola, like, it gets bleak pretty fast. - [Alex] Real fast. - [Nilay] Were you hoping that one of us would be like Motorola? - [David] I was hoping one of you would fight for Samsung, to be honest, just because I think it's possible to maybe want to pick an Apple product in another one because we've now ruled out every other Apple product. - [Alex] No, 'cause I'm looking at through the rest and I'm like, there's other really good competitors in these other places. - [David] Okay. - [Alex] But like the iPhone, if you're, if the phone is like the engine of the business, which it feels like probably is true, then we want the iPhone. - [Nilay] I mean alternatively the one that I would've argued for would've been the Pixel because then the one thing you would change about it would be caring and then, it would be good. - [Alex] Yeah, but the iPhone we've got like the people who are making the good processors on the iPhone, whereas the Pixel we've got not that. - [Nilay] But sure, but you know, a little caring goes a long way. - [Alex] Yeah, that's true. That's true. - [Nilay] He's also trying to market the phone would be useful. - [David] I mean, yeah, like in terms of raw upside, the ROI I think for the Pixel would be huge. Whereas the iPhone, I have a hard time imagining making the iPhone more successful, but it's also very successful. I think the answer is just the iPhone. I don't know that we need to talk about this much longer. - [Nilay] It's gonna solve every other problem on this list. - [David] So again, I would remind you that one of the things we are not trying to do here is build a services business or a monopoly. (Alex laughing) - [Nilay] Wait, we are not trying to build a monopoly? - [David] We wanna win. - [Nilay] Hmm. So you're saying this collection of three CEOs has to have some values? - [David] Yeah, we wanna like be cool. Our main value is like, be cool. - [Alex] Okay. - [Nilay] I want to have a monopoly in a cool way. - [David] Yeah. Yeah. - [Nilay] All right. Fair. Okay, we can move on. - [David] All right. So the iPhone, next up tablets, which is ironically a very similar set of companies, but I would say that we can't pick the iPad. So the iPad is out, which leaves us with the four nominees I picked so far were the Samsung Galaxy tabs, the Google Pixel tablet such as it is, Amazon's whole Kindle lineup, which I think counts as a tablet. KOBO, you could do One+. There's a lot of tablets out there. We could argue about the Microsoft Surface as a tablet line, but I think I won't count that. We'll get to that in a minute. What do you guys think? Who's the favorite here? - [Alex] I think we go with the books and then we have the Apple, the iPhone team make the operating system good. - [Nilay] Wait, is that, can you, can you make that choice? Can I pick the Galaxy but it runs iPad OS? - [David] No, but if we don't take the iPad, we don't get iPad OS. - [Alex] We're gonna use iOS to put on, put that on the books. - [Nilay] Oh, and then we didn't take Mac OS, which would've been the real move. We can't, huh? - [David] Yeah. See? - [Nilay] So wait, so wait, hold on. To wind this. - [David] You gonna wreck on all of this to get an iPad running Mac OS? - [Nilay] I have to like take the Pixel so I can take the MacBook, so I can take the Samsung Galaxy and make it run Mac OS. (Alex laughing) To get to a Galaxy Pad running Mac OS, I have to take the Pixel and then a MacBook. - [David] That would be the way. - [Nilay] I'm gonna be honest, I don't hate that strategy. I feel like this Board of Directors meeting will be very confusing. (Alex laughing) No, I'm with Cranz. I think you take the Kindle lineup, did jazz up the software a little bit. People are happy. - [Alex] I wanted to go books to get Escape the lock-in 'cause I feel like we save some money with that acquisition. - [David] But we can solve the lock-in. Remember Android is open source. So Android is fair game no matter what we do, we can just have Android. - [Nilay] We can un DRM the books is what you're saying? - [David] Yeah. - [Alex] Yeah. - [David] And I think so then the real question is like, who is better at making the hardware that we can take and have a pretty solid lead on? And I feel like it's Amazon. Like books does cool stuff, but I feel like if we just steal the Amazon team and we're like, what if we did a good job again? - [Alex] Yeah 'cause we get Panos. - [Nilay] Oh yeah, we get Panos. - [Alex] Yeah, we're doing the Kindle. That's right. - [Nilay] I feel good about that. - [David] Yeah. - [Alex] We're doing the Kindle, and we're gonna make it good now. - [David] It's a real culture hire right there. - [Alex] Yeah. - [David] Do we immediately kill the whole Kindle fire line and we just focus on E-Ink? - [Nilay] No, no, no. That's good for kids. - [David] Okay. - [Nilay] So actually I would say we take the tablet thing we're taking is like the extended Kindle. - [David] The Kindle universe we get. - [Alex] Yeah. - [David] All this class of KOBO tablets is accomplishing for anyone is playing Disney+ for your children. So we're just like, the Kindle Fire Kids is the centerpiece of our tablet strategy. - [Alex] And then we also just make a nice e-reader on the side that runs iOS. - [Nilay] Yeah, and then I can go to various state capitals and be like, you wanna make laws protecting kids? Make a law saying you have to buy a Kindle fire for kids. (David laughing) - [Alex] Yeah. There we go. I mean, I love how we're like making a really good culturally important company that also doesn't break laws. - [Nilay] I'm not trying to break the laws. I'm trying to make the laws. - [Alex] Yeah. - [Nilay] I'm trying to be the laws. Do you understand? If you don't buy a Kindle fire, you will be arrested. (all laughing) - [David] Here is my question is, do we reboot the Fire phone with our iPhone team? (Alex laughing) - [Nilay] Which part? Are we like- - [Alex] The 3D display. - [Nilay] We've already added 50 cameras to the phone. What if we add four more to make it 3D? - [David] Yeah. - [Nilay] And it's, one of them is just for barcodes. - [Alex] Yeah. - [David] Amazon Kindle easy choice. Next up is PCs. - [Nilay] And I think the list of folks is fairly familiar here. Alex, what do you got? - [Alex] Okay, so the list is, we can't do Apple, but we got Microsoft, Lenovo, ASUS, Acer, HP, Razor, Dell. I think we should go to Lenovo because if you get rid of all of the spamware that they like automatically install, you have some really nice laptops. - [Nilay] You got really nice hardware. - [Alex] Yeah, you got really nice hardware, and then we make the iOS team, they're gonna be working nights, but they're gonna have to basically like reinvent Mac OS, like they can figure it out. - [Nilay] You are back into it. You start, iOS started with Mac OS, and you're like, go the other way. - [Alex] Go the other way. I fully believe in them. If we can make PC clones, we can do this, too. - [Nilay] But we don't have the chips. I guess we do 'cause we have the iPhone. So now we just put a hinge and a lid on an iPhone, like, that's a laptop. - [Alex] Yeah. - [Nilay] Which is more or less the iPad. I just wanna be very clear about what we're discussing. We're like, we make iPads now. - [Alex] But it's also got the little, it's got the little the dot. - [Nilay] Oh yeah, the little, the Trackpad guy. - [Alex] Yeah. - [Nilay] I see. I was gonna say Microsoft 'cause I want, because control of the operating system. That's where I go to. - Right, and I want the surface line. - [Alex] I don't. - [Nilay] Now I've pulled the tablet ecosystem bigger, right? - [Alex] Yeah. - [Nilay] I've got my Kindles and my Kindle Fires, and I've got the Surface Pro, and I've got a whole range of products. - [Alex] Tell us about all of the really good laptops and all in ones that we're gonna get with our Microsoft acquisition. - [David] So here again, a lot of my strategy is just try hard. - [Alex] Okay. - [David] Right? Just to be clear. So yeah. The Surface Studio, but like, what if you put a real chip in it? - [Alex] Mmmm. - [David] And that's just me in meetings. Like what if circle this on the whiteboard and then write, try hard, and then like three exclamation points, and that's my whole Surface strategy. - [Alex] We can make it all run Risk V. (David laughing) - [Nilay] With like the power of one Raspberry Pi 4. (Alex laughing) Yeah, my vote. We, David, you're the tiebreaker here. It's between Microsoft and Lenovo. - [David] I agree. Lenovo makes some of the better hardware here. - [Alex] Yeah, you can make a compelling point about being able to have Windows and make it good. - [David] The one wrench I would like to throw in is that if we get Dell, we just instantly have the best lineup of Windows PCs that exists. - [Nilay] But we don't have Windows. - [David] We don't have Windows. Do we want windows? - [Nilay] You know, like for example, like, I would like to walk up to the box that says like security and write try hard. - [David] I will say though, under the rules of this game though, I don't, I think what we're getting is like a perpetual license to Windows. I don't think we're getting- - [Nilay] Even inside my, that's probably how the service team. - [David] Yeah. I don't think we get to run Windows. - [Nilay] But so when we took the iPhone, we don't get to run iOS. - [Alex] No, we do. That one counts. - [David] It does, it feels different. I can't describe to you why. No, it's because it's one device to one operating system. This is not one device to one operating system. We are a partner to the operating system, not the only venue for the operating system. - [Nilay] Even if we're Microsoft? - [David] We're not, but we're the Surface team. We aren't Microsoft, we're Vergecast Incorporated. We're not taking Windows from Microsoft. - [Nilay] Ah. - [David] I still think it's Microsoft, just because I think we're clearly building a luxury thing here, and I think getting there with Lenovo is gonna be challenging. Like, I don't know how we're gonna convince everybody that Lenovo is like, kick ass cool again. I think we can get there with Surface. - [Nilay] But no, but we are not Lenovo. We're just taking the product. We're doing a little rebrand. - [Alex] You got the Think Pad. - [David] Yeah, you're right. - [Nilay] Wearing a little coat of paint on there. - [David] Get the yogas. So you guys want some yogas? - [Alex] Yeah. - [David] They do the flippy things. I'm gonna make tent mode happen for America. Okay. I'm going Lenovo because I think we're gonna want Microsoft later. I think there are other things in this list that are going to be more useful to have for Microsoft. So I think we should pick Lenovo. - [Alex] You're right. That's true. - [Nilay] I'm dying to know what you think those things are, but we'll come back to it. - [David] Think of all the boring things that make you the most valuable company on planet Earth, and that's what Microsoft does so well. - [Alex] It's not the Surface team. - [David] Yeah, I think, all right, so we're picking Lenovo. Welcome to the team, the little nub. It's very, what's that thing called? The track point? Is that what that's called? - [Alex] The track point. Track point. - [David] Love that thing. - [Alex] We just call it a nub. - [Nilay] It's a nub. - [Alex] We're rebranding it immediately. (David laughing) Just immediate. That's the first thing we do. Day one. - [David] Yeah. I love this. All right, so just to recap so far, we're gonna take a quick break. We have, as Vergecast Incorporated, we now make the Apple iPhone, the Amazon Kindle, and Lenovo's set of PCs. I feel like we're doing very well so far. I'm excited about this guy. We're doing well. All right, we're gonna take a really quick break. We're gonna come back, do some more stuff. (upbeat music) All right. We're back, Vergecast Incorporated. We haven't talked about our pay structure, by the way, as co-CEOs, but we'll come back to that. It's gonna be very lucrative for us, because again, we're only gonna be in this job for six years, so we gotta we gotta do it and get out. (Nilay laughing) - [Nilay] Yeah. - [David] Next category. I think this might be the richest and sort of most evenly competitive category of all the ones we're about to do is wearables, and I'm defining wearables deliberately, broadly. Anything that you wear on your body counts. We can't do things like the Apple Watch or the Vision Pro. We can't do all of Amazon's weird Alexa wearable stuff, but I would say mostly we're still pretty wide open. - [Alex] You have Xreel on here? - [David] Yeah, I do have Xreel on here. (Alex laughing) I'm not saying we should pick it. I'm just saying it's a company I thought of when I said wearable out loud to myself. What do you guys think? Any jump out to you that we should definitely get into? - [Nilay] I have a clear favorite here. Out the gate, I'm going bold and taking Meta for the Ray-Bans. - [Alex] Oh, okay. Ooh, that's a good plan. I wasn't even, I was thinking of the headset. I forgot about the glasses. - [David] Yeah. Okay. On that front, do we get one or the other or do we get both? Like if we say Quest, we get all the Quests in one product, but I feel like the smart glasses are a different thing. - [Nilay] Get your face computers away from me. You know what I mean? Just that. No, no, no. Although what are three events? - [David] You just want the smart glasses. - [Nilay] I just want the glasses. - [David] Even if we get the whole team, we're immediately killing the Quest line and we're just going Smart glasses. - [Nilay] That's what he just did. I just wanna, that's what Meta just did. - [David] Yeah. - [Nilay] Mark Fish reorganized that team. So I am saying the glasses are the future. - [David] Okay. - [Nilay] And we're putting, we're putting our excess iPhone profits into the glasses. - [David] Interesting. - [Alex] Oh, I mean, if the glasses like ran a really good AI, well, no, we don't have one of those. We have Siri. - [David] Although on a six year time horizon, it's like. - [Alex] Hmm. - [Nilay] Hmm. Maybe I just wanna take Samsung's watches and do lock-in. (all laughing) - [David] I mean, that is, that is actually an interesting question, right? Like, are we betting that smart glasses are going to be sufficiently huge by 2030, that this is like, worth it for us? Or are we just taking like a nerd gadget for the next six years? - [Alex] No, this makes sense for us because we're like, we're cool. We're luxury. What's this luxury? Like a pair of Ray-Bans. - [Nilay] Fair. Okay, I have two others I'd like to throw at you. - [Alex] An aura ring. - [Nilay] That is one of the things I was gonna throw at you. I think Aura is like a sneakily, fascinating company and they're way ahead in Smart Rings. Smart Rings are a lot of people think, including our own V song about to be a real thing. I think especially if you're betting that this like health and fitness thing is gonna keep growing really fast, that's a place to go. I also think Garmin for kind of the same reasons, like what if we can redesign Garmin's watches so that they don't look dumb, but they have all the cool stuff that Garmin already has that people really like? I feel like you could make something out of Garmin. I also, my immediate reaction when we did this was Snap because I want the spectacles line, but I think we go Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and that gets us everywhere we're going probably significantly faster. - [Alex] Yeah. It's basically, do we wanna go watch, ring, or glasses? - [Nilay] Totally. - [Alex] But if we go Samsung, we do watch and ring, right? - [Nilay] Well, so the the thing that this I think makes very clear is you can take any of the watches and you can do iPhone lock-in, and now you have a realistic competitor to the Apple Watch, right? Like- - [Alex] Yeah. - [Nilay] That's the thing that actually holds a bunch of these companies back, is they cannot communicate with the iPhone. - [Alex] Right. - [David] Yeah, but that be cool Nilay. It's written at the top of the building of our headquarters. It just says, \"Be cool.\" - [Alex] What's cooler than lock-in? - [David] What's cooler than lock-in? (David laughing) Yeah, the change I'm making is being like, all right, whoop, you're in, like, let's go. You know? - [Nilay] Yeah. - [Nilay] Like you can, you can now more directly figure out Apple integrations. Buy a think pad, get a whoop, let's go, (all laughing) but I'm just saying like, if that on a six year time horizon, maybe that is a better move than take the Meta Ray-Bands and figure out how glasses work, which by the way, glasses also held back because they cannot properly integrate with your phone. - [Nilay] Yeah. - [David] This is like a real problem for all these products. - [Alex] But yet that's why like the glasses, we get them properly integrating with a phone. Then we also have like an additional audio solution. - [Nilay] When you say an additional audio solution, I mean, some headphones. - [Alex] Well, you know, we headphones is headphones coming up next, so. - [David] You've been a CEO for 20 minutes. You are already super corporate. - [Alex] Yeah, and we need more than one audio solution for our company guys. - [David] I've prepared a deck to talk about this. - [Alex] We need to be diversified in our audio. - [David] It's good. It happens to everybody. - [Alex] It'd be just immediate. Yeah, but the Garmin, like the Garmin has so much cool stuff in it. They just look so ugly, and we've got the Apple team now. Right? They can like, make it look good. We're that team, that poor team in Panos Panay just chained to their desk. - [David] We need that team to keep making iPhones though. I don't know. - [Nilay] But do they? It's not like they're doing a lot. They're like, take the buttons off it. You know? (all laughing) - [David] That's true. It's thinner next time. Like we did it. - [Nilay] I think you're the tiebreaker. I think it's between Garmin and Meta once again. David, you have to pull apart this corporate battle. - [David] I think we should pick Meta. - [Nilay] Ooh. - [Alex] Yeah. - [Nilay] Because I think the Ray-Ban-Meta partnership is cool. I think the glasses are awesome and people really like them, and I think our ability to like integrate them a little and make them way better for people, instant victory. Like I think with the other picks that we have here, we have a chance to like immediately make these things much cooler in a way that I feel like we're gonna have to basically like tear down the Garmin hardware team and build it back up, and I feel like that's gonna take us a while. - [David] Yeah. - [Alex] Yeah. That's gonna be more than six years. - [Nilay] Garmin, please know that I love you and you make cool things, just like make them cooler. - [David] Garmin, if you'd like to integrate with Vergecast Incorporated's iPhone, you can pay us 55%. - [Nilay] Yeah. We'd love to have you. - [Alex] We've got some really good audio solutions for you. - [David] The developer program is open, and it will only be slightly more than half of your revenue. (Alex laughing) - [Nilay] Yeah, also, the smart glasses are just like cool, and I love using them, and I want to have them. - [Alex] Yeah. - [Nilay] So we're going with that. I feel good about it. - [David] I don't love that we just hired a hardware team out of Meta, which makes me feel a lot of feelings in general, but it's okay. We're doing it. - [Nilay] We now know everything about you. (all laughing) - [David] Our privacy policy, by the way, is dope. Like, let's just take that for granted (Nilay laughing) 'cause you're wondering about our privacy policy. It is sick. - [Alex] The EU never gets mad at us. - [David] No. It's like not a problem at all. I should have said at the beginning, by the way, by picking the iPhone, we did just bring ourselves a delightful antitrust case that I'm not super psyched about, but I feel like it's it's one of those is coming anyway, right? - [Alex] Yeah. - [David] Like we might as well. - [Alex] Lina, call us. - [David] Nilay has been begging to fight an antitrust case. So like it's time. - [Nilay] Yeah, from this side, that's really what I've been after this whole time is let me be the monopolist. - [David] Yeah. It's perfect. - [Nilay] I'm just saying we're raising rents. If we're going down, we're going down rich. (Alex laughing) - [David] Yeah, and by the time any of this comes out, it'll be past 2030. We'll be out anyway. It's fine. - [Alex] Yeah. - [David] I'm not worried about it. Alright, next category is headphones, and here again, we're pretty wide open. Apple is off the board, but I'm gonna allow Beats to stay on the board because it is different enough that I think will allow it. - [Nilay] Because they don't care about it. - [David] Yeah, pretty much. Like, I don't know if Apple knows that it owns Beats, so we're just gonna let it ride, but there's also obvious players here. Bose and Sony, and Sonos is a new one. - [Alex] Just headphones though. - [David] We'll, no, we'll make this headphones/speakers. We'll go Audio solutions. - [Nilay] Oh my gosh. - [David] In Alex Grand's book. - [Alex] I think you know exactly where we're going with this. - [David] Nilay is gonna advocate for the party speaker. - [Nilay] Yeah. I'm taking Sony. Now that it's audio solutions. (all laughing) - [Alex] Yeah, we've got a lot, a wide range. - [Nilay] It's the ULT era. I mean, you want luxury. What screams luxury more than the words Mega Bass? - [David] A seven foot tall speaker. By the way, shout out to the Vergecast listeners who just send me pictures of it in the wild. - [Nilay] Amazing. - [David] It's like they're birding, you know, (all laughing) but like the only one person cares about birds and it's me. (Alex laughing) How does it feel to be known for the cyber truck wiper and Sony party speakers? Like, is this a good legacy that you're happy about? - [Nilay] Is that on the list? Cyber truck wiper on the wild card gadget, cyber truck wiper. - [David] We have two wild card options, so don't worry. For me it's Sonos on this one. - [Nilay] Interesting. - [David] I want Sonos real bad because again, we're in this like we want build cool stuff that's integrated. Sonos makes good products. They know how to make good audio products. I feel like we could take Sonos and be like, just learn how to make software. Everything's gonna be fine. - [Nilay] Just learn this easy part. - [David] Yeah. - [Nilay] Like, have you heard of apps? What if we did that? This could be fine. - [David] So again, I would actually take Sony here, not just because of the party speaker situation. I think our headphones are really good. - [Nilay] They are. - [David] My Sony noise cancels are really good, right? I think they compete with Bose to be the top of the market. Then they've got an actual audio solutions catalog, like an actual array of speakers and like, what is one product I want desperately from Sonos so they won't sell is like a receiver, right? - [Nilay] Fair. - [David] There's a huge array of those audio products that you can ruthlessly integrate with a phone in a way that even Sonos can't right now. That's why they have the software problems. Like their app platform has to support a bunch of stuff because they can't just put it on your phone directly, and also Mega Bass. I would just get it. - [Nilay] Okay. - [David] I would have it. Alex, what do you think? - [Alex] I just really like the Sony headphones. - [David] Okay. - [Alex] They just have such a nice wide, wider range. Like Sonos just got into headphones. They don't have any in-ear monitors. - [David] Sure. - [Alex] They don't have any buds. - [David] Also tough time to be taking over Sonos. Like, real kind of reputation hit. - [Nilay] Oh, you know what you don't have on here? - [David] What's that? - [Nilay] And again, I'm just gonna point this out for everyone. I think the age of televisions is coming to an end because David made a list of gadgets and didn't put TVs on them. - [David] Yeah. I don't care. No part of me wants to build televisions. - [Nilay] Well, I'll just remind everyone that I asked the CO of Netflix about the Samsung Frame TV and he was like, \"Well, stop talking to me.\" (Alex laughing) I was like, \"Do you think this is a harbinger of doom?\" And he was like, \"I don't know what you're saying.\" I own one, but I'm just saying you made an entire list of gadgets and you didn't put TVs on here. It's a prophecy. - [Alex] Because he knew you were gonna say we're gonna acquire the Samsung Frame and fix it. - [David] To be clear, not an oversight. We are not getting in the television business. What if we made no money and everything was impossible and we had to spy on our users? - [Nilay] All I'm saying is if TVs are on here anywhere, then I would change my headphones pick. If you're giving me audio solutions, but not TVs, then it's Sony. If TVs are back on the list, then I have to, I'm required by like blood and heritage to take Sony televisions. - [David] Okay. - [Nilay] And then I would change my headphones back. - [David] So we do have a wild card round coming later, and if you think you can win the fight for us to get Sony TVs, you can hold your fire for them. - [Alex] I'm gonna fight for TCL so hard. - [David] Yeah, I don't think you're gonna win the Sony TVs fight. I just don't think we wanna be in the TV business. - [Nilay] Well, if I take him off the board here, it's a big decision. - [David] How do I get Mac OS in the tablet? It's kind of the, you know, I gotta play three moves ahead. - [Nilay] I will be down with Sony here. By the way, tough beat for Bose that none of us are even attempting to take Bose. - [Alex] They're fine. - [Nilay] Well, well you made it audio solutions. - [David] Right. - [Nilay] If it was just headphones, I would immediately go Bose so I could win the Sony fight later. - [David] Interesting. Okay. Yeah, and I don't, it's just like a bunch of weird scientists in Massachusetts. Like, we don't need that. (Nilay laughing) I'll go Sony under one stipulation, which is that we immediately rename every single product they make to something not stupid. - [Nilay] No, with more letters. - [Alex] Yeah. - [Nilay] Twice as many letters and another dash in the middle for no reason. (all laughing) Just get in there. - [David] Okay. I think it's Sony. Okay. I feel good about this. I think we're aligned. - [Nilay] I can figure something out for TVs. - [Alex] Yeah. - [David] I feel now obligated to take something from Samsung just so that you can't argue for the Frame Tv because I don't need this in my life. - [Nilay] That's not what I was gonna take. - Again, I believe it's a harbinger of doom. (Alex laughing) - [David] Okay, so the next two things on here are, I would say the sneaky places we're gonna make a lot of money. This is what pays for everything else that the shareholders are gonna love, and we're probably never gonna talk about again. The first one is app platforms, which I suppose could be a single app if we wanted a single app, But I'm thinking more along the lines of like big groups of things. So like, I had Adobe Creative Cloud as an option here, and Microsoft Office, and Google Workspace. This is like probably B2B software that is going to make us just a tremendous amount of money. What do we think? - [Nilay] So I have to go with office. - [David] Okay. - [Nilay] Only for one small reason, and I can't believe you didn't think of it first, David. We cannot run this company without Microsoft Excel. - [David] Oh, that's interesting. - [Nilay] No company can be run without Microsoft Excel. - [David] Like just for our own survival. - [Nilay] Yeah. - [Alex] You know, you can just like pay for a license. We'll have so much money, we can just pay for a license for Excel. - [David] But what if other people paid us for licenses? - [Nilay] Yeah. I'm just saying you want a dog food, you know, your own your own work. - [Alex] Yeah, but we can have Adobe Creative Cloud and just have a stranglehold on the entire industry. (Nilay laughing) - [Nilay] You want people to hate us. - [Alex] We can just like, I love a monopoly. I'm on this side of things now. - [Nilay] Another antitrust fight that I'm really excited about, yeah. - [Alex] We're only gonna be there six years. By the time that stuff all hits, we'll be long gone. - [David] So I think the upside of Creative Cloud is we take Creative Cloud, we make the pricing better and we're legends. Right? Like instantly best possible PR win is we just like, give away Premier. We're just like, here you can have it. - [Alex] No, we sell like, rather than the cloud license, we're like, okay, you can just buy Premier, but it'll cost a thousand dollars. - [David] Yeah, yeah. - [Alex] Then we make a lot of money and people are happy because they can just own it. - [David] For six years? - [Alex] Yeah, for six years, and then it's gone and then, you know, whoever follows us, Panos, I'm sorry you're taking over the company from us. Good luck. - [Nilay] A lot of our ideas are like, what if we made slightly less money? - [David] But that's fine. - [Nilay] Whereas my ideas are what if we made a lot more money? (Alex laughing) - [David] Yeah. This says a lot about the distinct vibes of the Vergecast Incorporated team, I would say. (all laughing) It's either Office or it's Creative Cloud, right? I feel like there's nothing else you, like, we could go try to get like Oracle's weird business or like IBM's consulting arm or whatever, but we haven't picked a Google thing. - [Alex] Mm. - [David] Do we not want Google Workspace? Do we just take Google Workspace and go kill Office? - [Nilay] So my idea here again, you know, our company's mission is try hard. - [Alex] Yeah. - [Nilay] And workspace is a ripe target for trying hard. - [David] Yeah. - [Nilay] This is also where you could do messaging. You could, you know, you could walk in the room, be like, make a list of all the messaging products and then walk out and six months later you come back in and look at the list and you like circle one and you're like this one. We're just doing this one. - [Alex] Yeah. - [Nilay] And we're gonna name it G-chat. That's a real, that's a thing you could do here. - [David] It is. It is. Messaging I would point out is a separate category. So we're, we're gonna get to messaging, but if we, whatever company we pick here, we can't pick there. - [Nilay] Okay. - [David] Which is a case for and against some folks here. - [Alex] And if we pick Microsoft Office, we can't pick Azure. If we pick Google Workspace, we can't pick Google Cloud. - [David] That's right. - [Nilay] No one was picking Google Cloud. Come on. (David laughing) - [Nilay] I will concede and say we should pick Creative Cloud and our mission here is to make people not not hate us. - [David] Yeah, I think this is where we win over all the people to use our hardware because they're gonna love, this is how we sell Lenovo Think Pads. - [Nilay] Because of 55% lock-in, you can run Creative Cloud on someone else's laptop. It'll just cost four times as much money. (all laughing) - [David] I don't make the rules. - [Nilay] Yeah, except for that one. - [Alex] Well, just like the more your company makes, we charge you more, like just a sliding scale. - [David] Oh, I like that. You pay per YouTube subscriber instead of per. (all laughing) - [Alex] Yeah. - [Nilay] That' so evil. (all laughing) - [Alex] Exactly. Oh, you're just getting out in this industry, you basically get it for free. - [David] Right, yeah. I love this. - [Alex] The minute you start making success that we come for our cut. - [Nilay] And if you're wearing our wearable, we can track your general burnout level as a creator, and we start bringing the price back down. - [Alex] Yeah. - [David] I love that. - [Alex] See, oh my god. Synergy. - [Nilay] We actually turn the app off when you need a rest day and then, and then we'll give it back. Calm down, Jimmy. (all laughing) - [David] All right. So we're good on Creative Cloud. - [Nilay] All right, but I mean, sure. I think it's the right answer. - [David] That's okay. I know I'm the one who has to deal with like whatever terms of service conflagration. It's like, I'm fine. I'll do it. - [Alex] Yeah. David and I work four days a year. (David laughing) - [Nilay] Oh yeah. Cranz and I are the ones who like go to canned lions and like meet with advertisers. You have to actually like do the things. - [David] I have to write the blog post. It's like, all right, we changed our terms of service. - [Nilay] Exactly. (all laughing) It's true that we're gonna take your firstborn child, but we're doing this for the good of all humanity. - [David] This is beautiful. I love this for you. All right, next category is the boring B2B money faucets. This is where we get to, we get to pick our cloud provider. We can make B2B chips that we sell. I was gonna put Arm in here, but we can't have Arm because Arm only thing is Arm. So that doesn't really work. We can, this is where we make all of our money, but we try to never talk about in public because no one cares. - [Nilay] Can we take TSMC? - [David] What would you want to take from TSMC? - [Nilay] Making the chips for everybody? - [David] No, that's their whole thing. (all laughing) - [Nilay] But they don't make a product called TSMC. No, they don't ship TSMCs around the world. - [David] Right. That would be then just buying the company, which is not what we're doing. We're taking products. - [Alex] You get like one TSMC factory. - [David] This is like an expansion draft in sports, right? We get to like pick from your roster, but we can't have your team. - [Nilay] What about that one company in Europe that actually makes the lithography machine? - [David] Ooh. - [Nilay] The TSMC relies on that, like $23 million machine. - [David] Yeah. There's only, what's the name of that company? - [Nilay] ASML. I think we should take ASML. I think we should take the machine that makes the fabs. - [David] The machine that makes the fabs. Okay. - [Alex] Not like Azure. - [Nilay] Yeah, but like, you know, I'm already defending Creative Cloud. Like, I'm not trying to be outta here. - [Alex] I just wanna print all the money, like this is our money printer. Who gets mad at Azure lately? - [Nilay] Ah, no one, but it's also in second place, right? You have to go make the AI case, you gotta do the AI CRM thing to make, to grow Azure. I guess we're just milking it for profits and walking away, right? - [Alex] Right. Yeah. We're only here for six years. - [Nilay] And we can't take AWS 'cause we took the Kindle, right? - [Alex] Yeah. - [Nilay] Which is a very funny trade to have made. (all laughing) - [Nilay] If you're trying to build a business. - [Alex] I mean, ooh, we could take Whisper from Open AI. - [David] Whisper's open source. We're good there. - [Alex] Oh yeah. - [Nilay] Also open, it's on list as a money faucet, but it is not, it's like a reverse. It's a drain. - [David] Oh, true. I meant to write this as basically like, if we want, we can take like GPT-4 oh from OpenAI. - [Nilay] Which still, which they are now in a one, a stunning business. Judo move or giving away for free to Apple. - [David] Yeah. No, I'm not. I don't think that's the winner, but I just, I wanted to have an AI option here. - [Alex] Let's take Nvidia G-Force now. - [David] Yeah, so this is the thing. How do we get something from Nvidia? This is my question. What do we take from Nvidia? Is it just the H-100 business? Do we just take NVIDIA's whole AI chip situation? - [Nilay] I'm telling you. Do you buy a SML and then you're like, if you use these machines to make H-100s, 55%. (all laughing) - [Alex] That is a pretty good, funny faucet. I feel like we'll be ripe for disruption there. - [Nilay] Yeah, I think taking the Nvidia AI chip business is like a strong move 'cause now you're selling to Google Cloud and Azure, and on a six year horizon, they all wanna disrupt you, but they won't be able to. That's what I was about to say. Do we worry that every other chip maker on earth is going to start making these and this becomes a bad bet pretty soon? - [Alex] That's Panos' problem in six years. - [Nilay] Yeah, not in six years, baby. - [David] Okay. - [Nilay] In six years, I'm on a boat. - [Alex] Yeah. - [David] I mean, the other problem here is if we take that, the bubble bursts and we become the poster child of the AI bubble that just burst, and that's gonna happen in less than six years. - [Nilay] That's true. This is why I'm saying we should take ASML, the chip company. - [David] That is like the least sexy business you could possibly imagine in that. I doubt there's as much money in it, because I don't think they can make all that many of those. - [Nilay] They really cannot. - [Alex] It's like Samsung in their battery business. Actually, maybe this is a good idea, where Samsung just makes a bunch of random stuff that makes 'em a ton of money. - [Nilay] Oh yeah. We could take LG display right here. - [David] Oh, that's good. - [Alex] Ooh. - [Nilay] Right. You like, you wanna put another one in your phone? Come talk to Lucky Gold Star. You know? - [David] Wait, I like that a lot. - [Alex] I was like, LG display, that feels like it, the way we all were just like. - [Nilay] Yeah. See, and that feels, that feels sticky. They're gonna make screens for a long time. I feel like we're in and that's like, that's easy. It runs itself. We're good. All right. I love this. - [David] And, we love talking about it. - [Nilay] We do. - [David] You know? - [Alex] Yeah. - [Nilay] You want to talk about dual layer OLEDs? Let's go. - [David] Do you feel like this gets you close enough to the TV business that you're happy now, Nilay? - [Alex] They make the panels that go in your Sonys. - [Nilay] That's true. They do make the panels. - [Alex] Yeah. - [David] That's, we're like. - [Nilay] Fine, fine. I got myself a monitor in TV business. - [Alex] Yeah. - [Nilay] We're gonna take all the LG display and we're gonna make TVs. - [Alex] And then we're just gonna bolt two Sony party speakers to it. Boom. - [Nilay] You think we want to sell these tomorrow? Come on. Come on. - [Alex] Put some little pulsing lights at the bottom. - [Nilay] Yeah. - [David] Okay. All right, nailed it. That's good. LG display. This is great. Beautiful. I'm in. All right, we're gonna take one more break and then we're gonna come back. We got four more to do. We're gonna build Vergecasting. We'll be right back. (upbeat music) All right, we're back. Next up for the triumvirate at Vergecast Incorporated is messaging. We can take, again, not a company, so we can't take Signal from Signal or Telegram From Telegram, but we can take and reinvent any messaging app or platform or ecosystem that we want. We can't take from Meta, which I just realized because we took the Ray-Ban Smart Glasses, which I now slightly regret because I would like to have taken WhatsApp. - [Alex] So we can take all of the different Google chats that have existed and finally make one. - [Nilay] Yeah. This is our opportunity. - [David] Yeah. We can make G-chat. - [Nilay] Yeah, done. Done. (all laughing) I can solve, I can find, I can solve this. - [David] I mean, again, on the list of like, do it and be legends, finally making G-chat is way up there. - [Nilay] Just making G-chat and then I, you know, I got the phone. So, or your blue bubble problems are solved. - [Alex] Yeah. We don't have to worry about Messenger. - [David] We just put Blue Bubbles on the iPhone. - [Nilay] Yeah, it's super done. - [David] Whoa. - [Nilay] This isn't even, why are we even G-chat baby? I met my wife on that. That's a real story by the way. That's not just a case in your, that is a real thing. That's, yeah. Becky and I spent years of our early relationship in G-chat and nowhere else. - [David] Do you ever randomly find like the transcripts of those chats when you're searching for something in your Gmail? This is a thing that happens to me occasionally. I'll search for like, pizza in my Gmail and it'll be like, did you mean this conversation you had with your ex 11 years ago that we saved in Gmail? (all laughing) - [Nilay] Ooh, I haven't thought about that and now I'm worried about looking. - [Alex] Don't look. Don't look. - [Nilay] So we're gonna set that aside. - [Alex] Don't look, it's no good. - [David] It's probably for the best. - [Nilay] All of those G-chat conversations were before we were dating, so they were just conversations about the things we had gotten up to at night, which is a lot of things. - [David] I love it. - [Alex] Yeah. - [David] That's very good. - [Nilay] Yeah. - [David] All right. The only other one I would throw in is Slack, which I think is like a forever unrealized potential that. - [Alex] Or just Discord. - [David] So, but we can't take Discord 'cause Discord is Discord, right? Like. - [Alex] Oh, that's right. - [David] That's, it's off the- - [Alex] I thought somebody else owned Discord now. - [David] No, they almost sold, but it's still just Discord. Microsoft was gonna, but then they were like, this seems like a disaster, which probably reasonable call. - [Alex] G-chat being good, like, we're gonna kind of win people over with Adobe, but eventually we will jack up the prices on them and having like. - [David] Without question. - [Alex] Yeah. Just having G-chat there as like instant win. - [David] Okay. Okay. Oh yeah. All right. I feel good about this. It's G-chat and we're agreed that we're scrapping all the other nonsense, and we're calling it G-chat, right? - [Nilay] Yeah, yeah, yeah. Without. - [Alex] Yeah. - [Nilay] Easily. - [David] We are building the G-chat that always should have existed. Next one is streaming service, which is actually fun because again, we can't steal a company, so like, Netflix is out. - [Nilay] Oh, shit. We just traded G-chat for YouTube. - [David] Oh, crap. Oh, no, no, no. Can we go back? We should take Slack. - [Alex] We can take TikTok. - [Nilay] Oh, we can take TikTok. - [David] Yeah, you're right. We can take TikTok for now. It's on by chance. So, oh, we can buy. We are it. We are gonna save America. - [Alex] Yeah, we buy it. There we, oh my God. - [David] My dude. The wild card round here is amazing. We're gonna be heroes with G-chat, and we're gonna save America's youth. - [Nilay] Oh, wow. We just did it. This is. - [David] We did it. We're now the coolest company on earth. - [Nilay] Okay. - [Alex] Yeah. - [David] Yeah, and the good news is this one isn't even gonna be very expensive because they're desperately trying to get rid of it. (Nilay laughing) - [Alex] Yeah. Eat your heart out Oracle. - [David] We do have to fight the Chinese government and Larry Ellison. - [Alex] It'll be fine. - [David] Do you think at the end to buy TikTok you have to win a boat race against Larry Ellison? He's like, I'll do this. If you can beat me in the America's Cup. - [Nilay] Let's yacht about it. - [Alex] Yeah. (all laughing) - [David] Okay, so I will just say there's a bunch of Disney streaming services that are interesting. ESPN would make us an awful lot of money for a pretty long time. Hulu exists, Disney+ exists. We could have Apple TV Plus and have all the good shows. - [Alex] Yeah, but those are also dependent on external licenses that we might not acquire. - [David] True. - [Alex] With our streaming service acquisition, right? We're not getting the rights to \"Star Wars.\" - [David] We get all the existing contracts. - [Alex] Yeah. - [David] But I think you're right. If we get Disney+, we don't get to own \"Star Wars.\" You're right. - [Nilay] The economics of streaming are very simple. There's a handful of companies who think the Samsung Frame TV will continue to exist. Their business model is they pay a lot of money for content and then try to pay, make people pay money for it. The other model is TikTok gets free content from America's teenagers and then sells ads against it, and not for nothing. An infinite array of pirated movies from the idiots who are paying for content. - [David] Yeah. - [Nilay] It's gotta be TikTok you just for the economics of the business. Like, do you want to have costs or not costs? - [David] But again, TikTok not famously making a ton of money right now. - [Nilay] Well, 'cause they're, you know, we'll fix that, 55%. - [Alex] No, no. It's, we do something like deal with Adobe Creative Cloud where we somehow charge our own creators. - [David] Well, we're gonna have to, because if we get TikTok, we don't get CapCut. So we're gonna have to immediately put the Creative Cloud team on building CapCut so that people would. - [Alex] Yeah. - [Nilay] But the TikTok video editor is CapCut. So we just spin it out. - [David] It's good enough. Yeah. Like it'll work and we call it cut cap. - [Nilay] We can probably cut cap. - [David] Yeah. There we go. All right. TikTok and cut cap. We've done it. All right. I think that's right. I feel good about it. I like briefly wanted to fight for Prime video just because it is like, it's another one that is like, try harder. Oh no. We took Kindle. God. - [Alex] Yeah, we took Kindle. Yeah. - [David] The amount of money that cost that taking Kindle has cost us, Good Lord. - [Nilay] I mean, it is very funny that we took Kindle and Google Check. (Alex laughing) - [Alex] That's what we took from those companies. - [David] I will say, if we want to go back and take Slack and YouTube, we have a chance. - [Alex] No, we're committed. - [David] Is there anything cooler than fixing G-chat? Like, that might be the single most important thing we do at this company. I feel really good about it. - [Alex] I mean, the teens will prefer us for TikTok. - [David] That's true. Okay. So we have two more categories, one of which I just changed two minutes ago, and I'm very excited about it. So far we have the iPhone business from Apple. We have the Kindle business from Amazon, the PC business from Lenovo. We're doing all of Meta's wearables. We haven't decided yet if we're killing the quest, but we're probably killing the quest. We're all in on the smart glasses. We're taking Sony's audio solutions. We're taking Adobe Creative Cloud. We're taking LG Display, and we're taking G-chat. Well, we're taking the mess of Google's messaging systems, which I think actually probably means we hire most of Google because everybody's working on messaging in one way or another. (all laughing) and we're making G-chat and then we are saving America and taking over TikTok. How do we feel so far? Feel good? - [Nilay] Just how many rules? - [Alex] I'm feeling great. - [David] I really feel like it does. Lenovo is still very much the, like, weird one out, but we're gonna make Lenovo cool again. It's gonna be great. - [Alex] Yeah. We'll fix it. - [David] Okay. So we have, we have two left, which one is Wild Card Gadgets, which is, I think the rules still apply, so we can't take from a company we've already taken from, but we can take from any category, including categories we have not talked about. So it's some other product that Vergecast Inc. is going to make that is not off limits because we've already taken from another company. We can do TVs. This is where we take the cyber truck, if we wanna take the cyber truck. (Nilay laughing) Anything you guys want? Any initial thoughts? Anything you're excited about? - [Nilay] Well, so this is where I was gonna back into taking LG's TVs. - [David] Okay. Too late. - [Nilay] But then we already have LG display. - [David] I think this is better. We have the part of the business that's like good and not the part of the business that is Web OS. I feel really good about LG Display and not LG TVs. (Nilay laughing) - [Alex] Have you guys heard of a company called Stores and Bickel? - [David] Is this how we get into like Bespoke Whiskey? - [Nilay] I don't. - [Alex] No, this is how we get in. We just get the volcano. They make a whole bunch of different vapes. We just get the volcano business. - [David] Okay. - [Alex] And then we, like, we make one that looks really, really cool. We put a big screen on it. We put some big speakers on the side, just a whole one stop party business. - [David] It's just for Alex Cranz. - [Alex] It was just, you know, legalization is coming for this country. - [Nilay] True. - [Alex] We gotta be there at the start. - [Nilay] I'm not feeling that, I gotta tell you. No, I just feel like by, if we were in this till 2040. - [Alex] Yeah, that makes sense. - [Nilay] I'd be down. 2030 feels iffy, and that's just like a lot of legislation stuff. - [David] All right. I'm just, I'm throwing this out there. The Nvidia Shield. - [Alex] Oh yeah. We didn't do Nvidia, did we? - [Nilay] We didn't take, we took LG display over Nvidia GP business. (Alex laughing) We're doing really well. - [Alex] This gets us the Tegra. - [David] Yeah. Why this? - [Nilay] Because I think between Cranz and I, we can communicate with an audience of TV. We can bring the shield back to problem. - [David] This is a try harder booth. - [Nilay] Yeah. Look, if you look on the forms right now, people are like the shield isn't it anymore. - [David] It's true, and it was for a long time. - [Nilay] There's a lot of people who are like, what you want to do is run Infuse on Apple TV, and I think that's a shame. - [David] Interesting. - [Alex] Yeah. We're not getting Infuse. - [David] Do we wanna get into the car business is my big question here? - [Nilay] No, 'cause I, to be a successful car maker, you gotta, make a shoe, you gotta make a mid-size crossover, and that's just not for us. - [David] Okay, but again, we would take all the infrastructure required to do it. So we'd be up and running, making Kia Fortes is tomorrow. - [Alex] We're not buying Kia. - [David] We're not, we're just taking the Forte. (all laughing) - [Alex] I was like, I don't want any part of the Kia Hyundai business. They keep that. - [David] Nilay, you don't want the Mustang Mach E. This is your moment. Take the Mach E, man. - [Nilay] It's a shoe. I'm just telling you, I'm just not, I'm not making a mid-size crossover. - [David] All right. - [Nilay] No, thank you. Like, if you're gonna let me be like crazy about it, you know, let's get nuts, but I don't, that business is too, too wackadoo. I talk to a lot of car enthusists. They're all insane. Like, that's what will tear us apart. - [David] Okay. - [Alex] Wait, I thought of it. - [David] Okay. - [Alex] Samsung's barely a live digital camera business. - [David] Oh, I like getting into the camera business. - [Nilay] Ooh, and then we can actually make them smartphones, right? - [Alex] Yeah. - [Nilay] We actually take, you do the thing where you make the smartphone muralist camera. - [Alex] Exactly. - [Nilay] Interesting. - [Alex] Does Samsung still make cameras? - [David] Do we want Samsung's though? Or do we want like Fuji's X100 business? - [Nilay] Yeah, and then the solution is you just make them. - [David] Right. Make more of them. Let people buy them, who would like them. - [Alex] Yeah. - [Nilay] I like that. I like taking the camera. That's actually a great idea. - [Alex] Yeah, and then we fix the software so that it like, doesn't take you 12 hours just to change the setting. - [Nilay] Yeah. Sony cameras, but with menus that humans beings can navigate. - [Alex] Yeah. - [Nilay] But I do think Fuji's like a good, in terms of Wild Card Gadget, for our brand especially. - [Alex] And then we do like a limited release of the iPhone and the Fuji, and they have like the same look to 'em. We'd sell a lot of money. - [David] That's pretty good. All right. - [Nilay] That's good. - [David] So we're taking Fuji's X100. All right. - [Nilay] Yeah. - [Alex] Yeah. - [David] I like it, and then last category, the one I just added a minute ago, I had another non gadget wild card, but I think that's boring. So what we're gonna do instead is we're gonna buy a startup. - [Nilay] Yeah. I know my answer right away. - [David] Really? - [Nilay] Yeah. - [Alex] I really hope it's the same one. - [Nilay] It's Rivian. - [David] Oh, so you want to get into the car business? - [Nilay] Yeah. I was, because they don't make a shoe. (all laughing) - [David] They also famously lose all the money in the world. - [Nilay] Sure, but 55% I can fix it. - [David] If you want a Rivian, you have to buy an iPhone. (Nilay laughing) Rivians are now in-app purchases on iPhones. 55%. - [Alex] What about like, we could get SSI. We could have like just the AI guy. - [Nilay] It's just one guy. - [Alex] We're you're, we're all ready. - [Nilay] I mean, in that case, is Open AI still a startup? 'Cause that would be another. - [David] I was just about to say, I think open AI counts. - [Nilay] But you want something, you want like a startup, you want like an earthy. - [David] So my vote, if we're buying an AI company, I wanna buy Anthropic. - [Nilay] Yeah. - [Alex] Mm. Yeah. - [David] Which is, I would say less valued, but also way less problematic. - [Alex] And they're actually making products, right? - [David] Their product is moving along fast. They're like kind of right in the mix with Google and Open AI. I don't know that I want to deal with the, like, Sam Altman of it all, if I'm being honest. - [Nilay] And a CO is notoriously difficult to get. - [David] Yeah, exactly. - [Nilay] So if we're going AI, and that was one of my instincts, my vote would be Anthropic. I also think like a company like Notion would be an interesting one for us to buy, potentially a lot of money there. - [David] Is Notion a startup? They've been around for a long time. - [Nilay] This gets us into like, what is a startup zone? - [David] Yeah, like, is Stripe still a startup? They're doing pretty well. - [Alex] I like the idea of Anthropic though, like that is firmly a startup. - [Nilay] Yeah, Anthropic counts, I think. - [Alex] Like Rivian has factories. Is that a startup when it has factories? - [David] Fair. It is just a fair point. - [Nilay] It is pretty much a car company. - [David] Yeah, but Nilay, the problem is if we buy Rivian, they're gonna, we have six years to convince you to make a shoe. (Nilay laughing) We'll convince you to make a shoe. - [Nilay] Look, the R3X is very close to a shoe, but it's a cool shoe. (Alex laughing) That's all I got for you. - [David] So, okay. The other anthropic question is, do we wanna be in the AI game? Like, are we? No, we don't need a move. - [Alex] Not really, because then we have to deal with copyright stuff. Nilay's got a lot of blogs he's gonna have to write already, like apology blogs. I don't, we don't need more. - [David] Yeah. Nilay is definitely the one testifying in Congress. Right? We're all on the same page about that. - [Alex] Yeah. - [Nilay] I have several other options for you. Can I throw some options at you? - [Alex] I love an option. - [Nilay] We could buy DJI, another company that might need some saving in America that does some interesting stuff. - [David] But not a startup. So this is not just companies we could buy. - [Nilay] Mm. Is it not a startup? - [David] It's super not a startup. - [Nilay] Yeah, you're probably right. - [David] Okay. Fine. That doesn't count. There's the like, Canva's and Figma's of the world that also are kind of iffy on whether they're startups, but like, if we're in the creator world with Creative Cloud, we fold that in. The FTC won't allow it. - [Nilay] Yeah. - [David] These aren't the rules. - [Nilay] Canva is 10 years old and has a $26 billion value. Like, it's just like not a startup. (Alex laughing) They like, you wanna go? You need some installer shit. Like, what's some like weird two person app? - [David] Oh, interesting. Okay. - [Alex] Let's get CARROT. - [Nilay] Does Discord count? - [David] No. - [Alex] Yep. - [David] Not a startup. Like if Rivian isn't a startup, none of these other things are startups that you're mentioning. - [Nilay] Okay, fair enough. I think Anthropic is the best idea I have. - [David] Yeah. Anthropic is good. - [Nilay] I think I'm buying Anthropic. - [Alex] Yeah. - [Nilay] It's like we're gonna like run them off to the side though. We're gonna sort of Instagram Anthropic, where it's like you do your thing and if you become really successful, we'll ruin it for you eventually. (all laughing) - [Alex] Yeah. - [Nilay] But until then, like you're kind of, this is like your problem, and like if you get in trouble, that's your problem and not ours. We're gonna call them like the Moonshot Factory or whatever. - [Alex] Well, I think just having them collab on making Siri not suck would be like huge. - [Nilay] Yeah. Oh yeah. 'Cause we do need Siri to not suck. - [Alex] Yeah. - [Nilay] That's pretty important. - [Alex] Big, big change for us. - [David] Okay. All right. Anthropic, it is. Welcome to the team, Anthropic people. - [Alex] How do you feel about party speakers, Anthropic? (Nilay laughing) How can you make AI accelerated? - [Nilay] Make these LEDs blink smarter than ever. We have a lot of audio solutions that are ready for you. - [David] Okay. I feel like we've done this. Can I recap for you? - [Nilay] Yes. - [Alex] Yes. - [David] At Vergecast Incorporated, here are the things that we make now. We have the iPhone business. We have the Kindle business and all that that entails. Lenovo PCs are now Vergecast PCs, Metas whole wearables thing, the Quest and the Ray-Ban Smart Glasses. That's us now. Sony's audio solutions, headphones, party speakers, the whole jam. That's ours now. - [Nilay] Yes. - [David] Adobe Creative Cloud is our big software app platform play. LG Display is now ours. We are just fabbing it up for everybody. If you want a TV, hit up the Vergecast. I love this. Yes. - [Alex] That feels right. - [David] We are taking over all of Google's messaging shenanigans and turning 'em into G-chat, which might be the single hardest thing we signed ourselves up for here. - [Nilay] This is what kills us. I wanna be clear. - [David] I think that's right. - [Nilay] It's like the guitarist and the singer start arguing a little bit and then Oasis breaks up. That's messaging. Yeah. (all laughing) - [David] Joe Biden just gave us TikTok. Congrats to us. Big day. We now have Fuji Films X100 business, and Anthropic is now part of Vergecast Incorporated. How do we feel? - [Nilay] This feels good. This feels great. This is the right combo of things. We're doing a little bit of good. We're doing a little bit more evil. We're making some money, and then we're gonna fix messages. - [Alex] Yeah. - [David] We are incredibly deep into hardware. Like my only worry is like, should we not have done LG display and pick something that is more like cloud software? AIE? - [Alex] No, no, no. Because if we own the hardware, then they all have to do, we done AI, we got Anthropic. - [Nilay] Yeah. - [Alex] We got Anthropic in the iPhone. We have all the power. - [David] And Anthropic is like, their whole thing is they want to be like a B2B thing. So that could eventually pay dividends for us. - [Alex] And we have most of Google because we acquired all of Google messaging. - [Nilay] And we're just printing money on increasing Creative Cloud fees. (Nilay laughing) - [Alex] Yeah. - [Nilay] Just to be clear. - [Alex] Right. Microsoft is gonna be paying us so much money for their Creative Cloud. - [Nilay] I think there's money to be had. Again, TikToks business model is they pirate content. - [David] What are we gonna do with the TikTok shop? What's our first move with the TikTok shop? - [Nilay] Oh, we are 55%. Yeah. Straight up. (all laughing) You wanna transact in the TikTok shop? We're taking the fees. - [Alex] Yeah. We just charge outrageous fees there, except for our own products, in which case we give them, we don't charge a fee at all. - [David] Oh, yeah. The self preferencing is going to be out of control. - [Nilay] Yeah. - [David] On all of these. Like, do you want good Photoshop? You have to use our X100 camera. Otherwise you get bad Photoshop. Really? Sorry. (Nilay laughing) - [Nilay] This is actually great. It's like, why do these companies act like this? And it's like we're pretending we run the company, and we're like, we are gonna be so evil. - [David] We started out trying to do a good job and now we're doing this. - [Alex] We're just the most evil. Lina Khan just waiting behind us all right now. - [Nilay] Yeah. - [David] All right. Well, I think we've solved it. I feel like we're easily a trillion dollar company right off the bat here. - [Alex] Immediately. - [David] Our website is gonna be sick, by the way. - [Alex] Yeah. - [David] That's very important to me. We're gonna give all our products cool names, and our website is gonna be so tight with like a good, understandable URL scheme. These are the things I care about. (Alex laughing) I'm gonna run the naming of everything. You guys can run the company, but I'm in charge of names. - [Alex] Yeah. The speakers will like have real names. - [David] Yeah. - [Nilay] More letters. (David laughing) You continue to say this. There's only one solution. - [David] But it's, I think it's right. It's no more numbers. It's just all letters and you have to guess what the letters mean because they're in no order. It's just consonants and you have to guess. That's all of our products from now on. I love it. - [Nilay] I'm very excited and I promise the people Mega Bass is coming back. - [David] Absolutely. Mega Bass is coming to many new products. We have new places to put Mega Bass. The iPhone is gonna have a hardware Mega Bass button. We are gonna rattle your head off with the smart glasses with Mega Bass. (Nilay laughing) We will give you and solve your migraines all once. G-chat Mega Bass. (all laughing) - [Alex] Every time you type just a (Alex blowing raspberry) - [Nilay] All right. Well, it's been an honor. Thank you for joining this company with me. - [Alex] This is wonderful. - [David] This is gonna be a wild six years. - [Alex] Yeah. We're gonna make so much money. Panos, have fun. - [Nilay] And then go to jail. - [Alex] No, Panos goes to jail. - [Nilay] That's true. - [Alex] We're out. We're out. - [David] Lina Khan, you know how to reach us. - [Alex] Yeah. - [David] All right. Thank you, guys. We'll do this again soon. - [Nilay] Thank you. (upbeat music) - [David] All right. That is it for the \"Vergecast\" today. Thanks to Nilay and Alex for doing this weird thing with me, and thank you as always for listening.

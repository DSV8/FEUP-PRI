Get 1000 free supercharger miles with our code:  We knew that getting in and out of a vehicle would be pretty much the same no matter what car we bought. BUT by getting an electric 'self driving' capable vehicle, we could avoid gas stations, and let Cambry's hands take a break while using the Tesla Autopilot. Not to mention the Smart Summon ablities. No more blocked parking lot spaces! The future of electric cars is looking pretty bright. Yeah, a Tesla is very expensive at the moment, just like all technology, its interesting to know that the technology exists, and will get cheaper and more common with time.

    "transcript": "[Zack] Alright, I'm ready. You ready? Okay... [Cambry] Three, two, one...blastoff. [Music] [Cambry] Nature everywhere. Really cool. [Music] [Zack] That is amazing. So there are a lot of cars out there. A huge variety. And all of them are good for different things. [Cambry] And there's a lot of cars out there that are great for people with physical limitations like myself. Some are better than others, but pretty much any car can be adapted for a wheelchair user. But there are not very many cars that don't require you to go to the gas station. And if you're a wheelchair user, you know that's a big deal. I'm talking big deal. And I'll show you in a second why that is. [Zack] Full disclosure: since this technology is new, it's is ridiculously expensive right now. But like with any piece of tech, the price is going to drop over the next couple years. And it's just good to know that it currently exists. [Cambry] One way to get a price break on technology is buying it used. [Zack] We bought this Tesla Model X used from Dan, from the YouTube Channel What's Inside. And it has some features that are awesome for everyone, but more so for Cambry. And we'll show you what those are. [Cambry] Let's get started. [Intro] [Zack] So this is the Tesla Model X. The SUV version, all-electric, and is super incredibly fast. The Model X has a range of 280 miles, which is about the same as a tank of gas in a normal car. It's got a lot of personality with the Falcon doors. And I think it's going to fit Cambry pretty well. It's got automatic doors which is great. [Cambry] With my last car, I never used the back hatch because I wasn't able to reach it once it was up to bring it back down. So with the Tesla, you can open it with the fob, and close it with the fob, or your app on your phone. Which makes my life a lot easier. [Zack] Cambry, you want to show us how to get inside? [Cambry] Yes. [Zack] So you might not thing that going to a gas station is a very big deal, but when you're in a wheelchair it's a totally different ball game. [Cambry] You have to transfer the wheelchair and yourself in and out of the car twice. It's like going to the gym just to get gas. [Zack] So getting an electric car avoids the gas station altogether. But even though we get to avoid the gas station, Cambry still has to get in and out of the car. And no matter what car we get, the process is going to be basically the same. [Cambry] So I put my feet in first...or my legs in. And then I grab onto the steering wheel. It's locked at this point. I put one hand on my cushion and then I rotate in. And then I have to take this apart...when I'm by myself. [Zack] When I'm with her, I help her out and then put the chair in the back. The back seats fold down and there's enough room for her wheelchair. [Cambry] You can tell this is quite the process, so imagine doing this at the gas station multiple times in a row. [Zack] The wheels come off easy enough. Then she can take the wheels and put them in the back seat right next to one of the pilot seats in the middle. [Cambry] And then I've got to make some space to pick up this guy. And then I place it on the passenger seat next to me. There you have it. [Zack] So you can see why avoiding the gas station is a good thing. Not only does she have to disassemble her chair, but reassemble it when she gets back out twice for the gas station. So having an electric vehicle that she can just plug in when she gets home is pretty awesome. So since Cambry's chair is made of metal, we added some protection. Some clear plastic protection right here along the side walls, so when she brings her chair into the frame it doesn't scratch anything. As well as we have a seat cover on this seat as well as the center console and a screen protector on the display. So if anything taps the display or the seat... [Cambry] Or the door. [Zack] ...or the door, everything's always protected. We had our buddies over at Luxe Auto Spa, the same people who wrapped Dan's Tesla gray, applied those special protection features for us. I think they've done a pretty good job. We've had this car for about 2 weeks now and there's been no damage to the actual car. You might have heard that Tesla's have something called autopilot, and you might think that with autopilot someone with a disability can just jump in and start driving, but that's not the case yet. Full autonomous driving is coming in the future, but for right now, Cambry needs hand controls to operate the vehicle. [Cambry] Okay, this car is already pretty well adapted to me, like we didn't have to make very many modifications. But something that I will always have to make modifications on is the hand control. Since my legs don't work, my hand controls do the job. So this part, if you push forward, applied pressure to the brake. And then if you rock it back, it electronically controls the acceleration. Pretty cool. One of my favorite features is when you apply pressure to the brake, the door closes. [Zack] Nice. [Cambry] And then I don't have to reach for it. Quick side note, one of my favorite features, and I know that there are a few cars out there that have this, but the steering wheel heats up. And I am always cold, so it is maybe my favorite feature of this car. My hands are nice and toasty. [Zack] Yeah this has a lot of features that make life easier for everyone in general, but I think my favorite is that it's quicker than most sports cars. Especially since Dan splurged a little when he bought it and got the P100D which means this is the fast Model X. And Cambry has been fast. She's launched it a couple times in ludicrous mode. But she's never done it herself personally. So this will be the first time. Are you ready? [Cambry] Are you ready for this? [Zack] I guess that is the question. Yeah, I think I'm ready. [Cambry] Three...two...one...blastoff. [Zack] Oh my gosh! [Cambry] I feel like my eyes are shaking! [Cambry] Three...two...one...blastoff. [Zack] Oh my gosh! [Cambry] I feel like my eyes are shaking! [Zack] I feel like you got to 30 miles an hour and stopped. [Laughter] [Cambry] That scared me! That's like losing control! [Zack] Seat belts tighten up every time too. Oh that was fun. You can feel like the blood rush to the back of your head cuz the acceleration is just so intense. [Cambry] I think my eyes are shaking like this. [Zack] That's crazy. We had a friend in the car once and he's like 'man, my blood forgot how to circulate' which is like the perfect example or the perfect analogy of what happens when this thing accelerates. [Cambry] Perfect description for sure. [Zack] That was fun. [Music] [Zack] How was it? [Cambry] I just want to keep driving these trails. [Zack] It's super pretty out right now. [Cambry] And there are like homes on the side of these roads that I'm sure they can't get to in the winter, but super cool. And it's just like mind blowing how many colors are still out there. Like a lot of the leaves have fallen, but it's still just like nature...everywhere. It's really cool. Hi Bertha. Hi. So when I take my hand off the accelerator, the car takes that energy of slowing down and puts it back into the battery. So essentially we could gain more miles by going downhill and using that energy. [Zack] So one of the reasons we chose the Model X over the Model S or the Model 3 was because it has slightly better off road capabilities, and it can tow things which Cambry's pretty interested in. [Cambry] The thing I like about it is you can change the suspension height so it can be low for me to transfer in and out, but then it can also be raised when we're off-roading. [Zack] So obviously buying a Tesla is fairly expensive at the moment. The price is going to drop with time. And if you do end up buying a Tesla, the best way to do it is with a Tesla owner's code. Yeah you can walk into a dealership and just buy a Tesla outright, but if you have this code you get an extra 1,000 miles of free supercharging. A thousand miles for you and a thousand miles to the person whose code you're using, which would be me and Cambry. Supercharging is what we would use on long road trips. It fills the Tesla battery super quickly with power. We can fill a large chunk of the battery in just 30 to 45 minutes. A lot of people might think that you have to use the superchargers, but in reality, most people, including us, have a little charging station installed in our garage. The superchargers spread out across the United States are mostly just for long road trips. So one thing that bugs us both quite a bit is one, when there's no parking because someone takes the handicap spot. Or two... [Cambry] Someone parks right next to my car and I can't open the door wide enough to get in. [Zack] She needs a lot of space. One cool thing with the Tesla is that it has the summon feature, but it's also now, with just this update, it's a smart summon. Which means that she can park anywhere and she can call the car to her from across the parking lot. We're going to try it out. So right now Cambry's parked in an impossible location. There's no way she can get into the driver's seat, but since she has the app on her phone with the smart summon, she can now summon the car. And it knows there's a car next to it, and it's going to come find Cambry. [Cambry] I can't believe it did it with a car next to it. [Zack] What do you think about that? [Cambry] Yep. I approve. [Zack] We're on the freeway right now and Cambry has never tried out autopilot in her Model X yet. So we're going to do it for the first time. So Cambry, when you're driving and there's that gray steering wheel up in the corner, it means that the car has identified the lanes in the road and it's ready to assist you with driving or self driving. So on the steering wheel on that far side, there's a tiny little knob that if you click it towards you twice it will go into autopilot mode. [Cambry] And it'll keep the same speed. [Zack] It'll keep the same speed and distance from the cars in front of you. [Cambry] Okay, so just tap it twice? [Zack] Click it towards you twice, yeah. [Cambry] Okay. Are we sure? Okay. [Zack] There you go. Now the car is driving by itself, staying within the lines. [Cambry] This makes me anxious. [Zack] And now the steering wheel is blue, meaning that the car is driving itself. And about ever 60 seconds or so there will be a little flashing light that pops up saying take control of the steering wheel for a second. So you just have to nudge it to prove that you're still awake and listening. Dan and I made a video about what happens if you fall asleep while autopilots engaged. So I'll leave a link for that down in the description. It's pretty cool. Cambry, what are your thoughts about autopilot? [Cambry] Um, initially it's nerve-racking cuz I didn't quite trust it. But I still don't trust it 100%, I'll still keep my eyes on the road. But it allows for a little bit more freedom of my hands to do something else like grab the window. Roll it up or down. Grab my drink real quick. Fix my seat belt Adjust something for like the speed of the windshield wipers. It just gives me a little bit more freedom because my hands are always occupied if I'm doing it all all the time. [Zack] And the best thing about all of this is that the autopilot capabilities are just going to keep on getting better and better. Right now the autopilot can navigate us while we're on the freeway, but soon, in the next year or two, it'll be able to take us from our house to our destination without us actually needing to drive ourselves. [Cambry] Crazy. [Zack] So as this car is passing us on the side, we can see that the Tesla has recognized it and knows its position. It recognizes the other cars with all the cameras positioned outside of the vehicle and that's what helps us drive safely. So Cambry, now that you don't have to control your vehicle with your hands, what are you going to do with them while you're driving from now on? [Cambry] I'm still a responsible driver. I'm not going to be putting on makeup or anything. I'm going to rest my hands. [Zack] All the charging stalls are full and there are so many Teslas just sitting and waiting to plug in. Alright, there's Dan. Open the door for him. And it's opening up. Convenient. [Dan] I miss this car! It looks so good. It's been a while. How long has it been since I've been in this car, like 3 or 4 weeks you guys have had this now? [Zack] Yeah it's been a little bit. I think the real reason you sold the Tesla to Cambry was because it's more of a feminine vehicle... [Dan] Oh is it? [Zack] ...and you were scared about racing my truck. [Dan] See, I'm okay with the race. I don't know if that's a thing, but I'll let you go with that. [Zack] That's the real reason. So there we have it. We have the old owner in the backseat and the new owner in the front seat And I think we're going to have a lot of fun with it. So if you want to watch Dan's video on why he sold his Tesla, I'll leave a link for that right here. Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. And come hang out with Cambry and I on our Instagrams. We'll leave a link for those down in the description. And remember how we finish it off? [Dan] I miss this car. Is that how we finish it? [Laughter] [Cambry] Thanks for watching. We'll see you around? [Zack] Perfect. [Cambry] Yesss. [Zack] Nice.",

    "transcript": "(cameraman laughs) - What's better than two wheels? One wheel. I'm so excited to try this 'cause I've never ridden a one wheel. This is the Pint X so it's the smaller brother of the Pint. Not the Pint. It's the GT, ah! It has double the range of the old Pint, up to 18 miles per hour. That's 30 K for you metric folks. And it will prove to be a challenging ride, I'm sure. But let's open up; see what's inside. What is the X factor? \"Life is about to get more awesome.\" I sure hope so. It's got that new rubber smell. What sort of accessories could they include in this thing. Ooh, stickers! Love me some stickers. These are vinyl cut, decals. Owners manual. I will definitely be flipping through this before I risk life and limb. It looks like this is the basic charger. They do have an ultra charger, which reduces the charge time to just under two hours. But this on its own I think is three hours, 45 minutes, from a dead battery. Then we have the unit itself. (grunts) She's hefty! Oh my gosh! There's handle? Oh, there is a handle. It's so handy. That is an absolutely unit. First glance it looks like brushed aluminum, but I doubt it is. It's probably plastic, but I can appreciate that attention to detail. It's very dusty. We have a 10 and a half inch by 4.5 by six tire. I don't know exactly what those mean besides 10 and a half inch. So this tire is half an inch narrower and an inch taller. - [Jono] It's 27 pounds. - 27 pounds! I mean you can make a bike a lot lighter than 27 pounds, but this has a motor. 750 watt motor? Because anything bigger than 500 Watts in Canada requires a license and insurance, I think. All I know is it's super illegal to ride this on any public street in Canada, or at the very least in Vancouver. Let's look at the bottom down here. So, we have two huge pads and I'm assuming these will get really banged up. It doesn't even look like this has been ridden. So, I don't know what you're talking about Jono: saying this has been opened before. So, it is a Bluetooth connected device. So, I think the next step is to turn it on. There is a button. Yeah? Oh, we got light. Okay. And I guess we got to open the app now. I mean, I see \"XR.\" I don't know what those are and I see \"Pint.\" I'm just gonna go with \"Pint.\" See how it goes. Power up your board. We did that. Always wear a helmet. Engage the footpad. Oh, they want us to stand on it already. We'll give you some of the texts and the specs. This guy runs in around $1,400. So, that's $350 more than the standard Pint, but it does go faster and does have much more range. I think it tops out around 18 miles on this guy. So, that's a good distance. I could commute on this. I don't think I'd want to, but I could. There's no fender here which seems mildly dangerous, but the gap between the wheel and the board is pretty small. So, I wouldn't feel like your foot's going to get sucked in. So that's good. I'm sure you can get a fender that bolts onto this. - [Jono] You can customize it. - Fantastic! You can customize them. It is tail heavy on the battery side. So, underneath this pad we have a huge, I think it's lithium ion, not lithium polymer. - [Jono] Lithium-Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt-Oxide battery. - Okay. That's a lot of heavy metals. It's a heavy battery. Upfront, we have the controller. So, as far as I'm aware, this is the ESC to control the motor. And then the actual brain box that you talk to with your phone. And it has a accelerometer, I'm assuming, here that tells you how far you're leaning. It has four what they call \"shaping modes\" and a \"shaping mode\" is kind of like a PID control loop. It translates what you input into your output. So if you want it to be super aggressive, you can change your \"shaping mode.\" I don't know what they're called just yet, but we'll find it in the app, I'm sure. And you can set how aggressive you want this to be. On the XR, the big brother, you have five \"shaping modes\" and you can customize it. So, if you're very particular or like you ride only in sand or something like that, you can set it up to be just so. - [Jono] Why would you get this over the GT? - Why would you get this over the GT? Well, presumably because it's way cheaper. It's like $800 cheaper. The GT does have a little bit more off-road chops. It's got more clearance angle, like a departure, and all that jazz upfront. Oh, well speed and battery of course. The GT goes an extra two kilometers or two miles an hour faster. 20 miles which is like 34 kilometers an hour. I don't know about you, but going 34 kilometers an hour on one wheel, it sounds terrifying. Okay. What's in the owner's manual? What do you think? What's the first page? I think that's important. \"Welcome to the revolution. \"You're the very proud new owner \"of a one wheel Pint.\" Awe, I get to lean on someone. \"Slowly, come up to balance.\" So, get up onto the balance, and then once you're up on a level the controller will take over and kind of keep it level, I'm assuming. \"Warnings,\" yeah, that's a good second page. \"Risk of death or serious injury.\" I hope none of those happened today. Oh, look at this guy! That's going to be me! (Jono and presenter laugh) Wait, wait! Oh, yeah! I can do that! So, these are bumpers are replaceable. They're wear and tear items and they seem to be pretty easy to take off as far as I've seen. It's just four screws on this front one and the back one looks to be also the four screws. You know what? I'm done with instructions. - Wait a second! What about today's sponsor \"Dream.\" The Dream Bot L10 Pro is a robo-vacuum that features SLAMTEC and LIDAR to map your rooms in 3D for precise navigation. Really important, you know, because you move stuff around. When partnered with it's intelligent object recognition and avoidance you can be sure that it'll find all of the dirt, without falling down the stairs. With 4,000 PA suction; a 150 minute ultra long runtime; and built in mop functionality; It'll clean every corner of your house with ease. Don't want it to clean certain areas? Use the app to choose a routine that works best for you. So, check out the Dream Bot L10 Pro today! And, for a limited time only get 25% off using the link in the video description. - First step was to put on all the safety gear. So I do have pads under these jeans. Helmet. I have gloves I'll put on, but phone first. We have to actually pair it. So engage the, the front foot pad has a sensor on each side. It's like giving you instructionals. There's videos. That's neat, I guess. Oh, you can't skip them! That's cool. Digital shaping. Let's ride! Okay. Location. Sure. There it is! Found it! Okay. Activating: 33%. Simple snap enabled. Region. Let's try Redwood, whatever the heck that means. I don't know. That's okay. That's fair. This is a surprisingly easy. It's pretty stable. Weeee! Yeah, Redwood is pretty chill. I feel like I need to hit some top speeds already. Oh boy. Oh! The breaking is like, it's good, but wasn't ready for it. I had the go, I didn't have the stop. Okay, let's try hopping back up on it. So like once you tip up, then the controller hops in and it's like, okay, we need to establish level. Okay here's the pose. It's not scary. At no point was I afraid of this. We're going to go to Pacific X. Wow! This feels immediately different. It's much less lean forward. Okay, that's enough speed. You do not need to go faster than that. We have to have the top speed don't we? The people want to see it! Okay. Okay. Let's just change the riding mode one more time. - [Jono] What's the top riding mode? - There's \"Elevated X\" and \"Skyline X.\" - [Jono] Skyline! - Skyline GTR! Oh yeah, that's got beans. This ground is very unstable. Or not flat. Oh, go on the gravel? Okay. It'll do it. Sick. (laughs) All in this thing's cool. I am by no means an expert. I'm not a Ren, but I get it. If I had 1400 bucks, I would buy one. But I hope you liked my Short Circuit and I hope you like Short Circuit. Get subscribed. Follow us for more fun, outdoors, tools. I think we have the XR coming in. - [Jono] The GT coming in. - The GT! That's right! So we have the bigger version of this coming in. Comment down below if you want to see that. And have a beautiful day.",

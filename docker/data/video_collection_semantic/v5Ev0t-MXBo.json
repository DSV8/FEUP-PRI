    "transcript": "- Hey guys, how's it going? It's Justine, and today we are doing a very interesting unboxing. Some of you may have seen that I was on Good Morning America not too long ago. I was on the show talking about Walmart's Black Friday deals, and it was the best time ever. And in front of me and beside me are a few of the things that I talked about on the show. Black Friday starts on Walmart.com on 11/21 at 10PM. In stores starts on Thursday, 11/22 at 6PM. Before we get into these items, there's also a Walmart.com app, so you can download the app ahead of time. You can make a game plan for what the things are that you want to get in-store. It'll give you a map, so you'll easily be able to find all of the things when you actually get there, and it's time to start shopping. So now, let's get into checking out some of these items. These were a few of the highlights that I saw on their list of Black Friday deals that they have. You guys know, I love video games, so these are two console bundles that they have. Both of these are $199. This is a PlayStation 4, Spider-Man bundle, and this is the Xbox One S. This is the Minecraft edition. So, obviously with both of these you do get the games, the controller, and the console. I'm not going to unbox these because you've already seen me unbox Playstations and Xboxes before. We need to get into these mystery eggs. This is the HatchiBabies. I have not even seen these before. I had a Hatchimal last year, and I refuse to let it hatch. Like, if anybody touched my Hatchimal that was sitting on my mantel, I'd be like no, don't do it. I think that this year, I'm going to let this one actually hatch. So the Black Friday deal for this guy is $34.88. Ding Ding Ding, I'll take two. Unboxing toys, it makes me feel like a kid again. This is so exciting. (plastic crackling) Next video, I shattered my Hatchimal. A little pony stand to put your egg in. (toy laughing) Hello, I'm your new mom. That's a rocking horse. Is it crying? Hey are you okay in there? (toy crying) So next up, we have Ryan's giant mystery egg, and this actually holds a very special place in my heart because Ryan is a fellow YouTuber. He does toy unboxings and reviews, and I love his channel. I love everything that they've created with Ryan, and what's special about this, there is one lucky egg that contains a golden ticket that will allow to go and meet Ryan, be in the unboxing video of his. It has all kinds of fun little mystery things. Slime, putty, squishy plush, two figures, lights and sounds, a vehicle. All for $34.82. Black Friday deals coming in hot. Oh my goodness. There's a lot of things in here. Wow. This is a premium egg. What is this?! When they said a vehicle, I thought like a little tiny car. Oh no, this is a flying saucer. (flying saucer noises) I'm assuming it had a character to go in here. There's mystery slime. You can collect them all. Oh gosh collecting things is my weakness. You're going to see me cruise around Walmart with like 50 eggs in my basket. Trying to collect all of these characters. Wow, it's squishy. When they said squishy, like I read the words, but I didn't visualize it being this squishy. It's a little alien. This all makes sense, in Ryan's world. Look, it's a little key chain. This is like the egg that doesn't stop hatching. Again, the giant mystery egg of Ryan's is 34 dollars and 82 cents. And next up, we've got another little mystery thing. This is the LOL Surprise Pearl Surprise Black Friday deal is $29.88. It's got it's nice little sticker here that says peel here. Oh, let's talk about impeccable packaging. Hey, over here. Me first. Oh my gosh I get it. This isn't an egg, that's why these are pearls. You're getting a surprise pearl. Let's see what we have in here. What is this?! This is the most massive bath bomb that I have ever seen in my entire life. This is like a bath bomb that you would throw in your swimming pool. Don't throw it in your swimming pool because I'm pretty sure your parents would get very upset with you. - [Man] What is it? - They're little shoes. There's a bikini shirt. Another little bikini, where's the body? Where's the body? - Just zoomed in with the camera. - What, are you pointing at it? The body is in a bath bomb. Oh my gosh. Alright, well we're going to have to cut to that. This bath bomb in the bath. Oh my gosh! The moment that we've been waiting for. This all makes so much more sense now. This is probably one of my favorite deals. This is the Pac-Man Retro Arcade. Of course all of these things, as a reminder, because if you've never shopped Black Friday, they are while supplies last, so definitely do your best to be first in line, or first online. Alright, are you guys ready, because I'm going to turn this thing on, and I just want to warn you, it's really loud. (electronic buzzing) (Pac-Man waka waka) This is so fun. What a fun throwback game. I feel like this is something that would be great for collectors, or honestly anybody. I wonder how many kids out there have never even, I feel like they've probably heard of Pac-Man, right? I don't know. (game over music) Oh, that's a terrible terrible sad sound. It's the game over. Well, thank you guys so much for watching. I hope that you guys enjoyed this video. This was so much fun, and I think that my new hobby is now going to be opening mystery eggs. Maybe I should start a second or third or fourth channel for my new hobby. And again, Black Friday starts on Walmart.com on 11/21 at 10PM Eastern, and in-stores, Thursday, 11/22 at 6PM, whatever you're local time is. Well thank you guys again. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like for me to check out, and if you did catch the Good Morning America segment, leave me a comment below and let me know. I'll see you later. Bye. Oh gosh, I have so many new toys to play with. Mmm, I'm an adult. (merry music)",

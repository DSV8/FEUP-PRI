    "transcript": "This here is another viewer's broken gaming pc and this one is rather modern we're talking like ryzen 5 3600 circa somewhere around there we'll check it out in more detail in a second i do know that this graphics card is an rtx 2060 asus strix model very nice and the viewer suspects that this card is to blame for the computer not sending a picture out yeah in 2021 that is um that's a big ol it's a bit of backstory this system was working just fine a few weeks ago the owner bought a wi-fi card that connects directly into one of the pci slots on the motherboard uh he turned the system off connected that card powered it back on everything was working just fine except for the card itself the wi-fi card apparently needed drivers or something so he went to the manufacturer's website decided that looked a little too sketchy i think this was like a knock-off wi-fi card and the website just yeah it just it didn't really sit right with him and look at your system you're the probably the best judge of character there if you think it looks too sketchy that's fine he towered the system back off and just removed the card i think he was going to return it and he was going to stick with the usb wi-fi dongle he was using previously well after doing that for powering the system off pulling out that wi-fi card and then powering a system back on suddenly no picture out what's up with that so he thinks it's possible that during this process he bricked his graphics card that that would really suck and i'm not even sure really how that could have happened if all you were doing was inserting and removing a wi-fi card and if you were doing it correctly look this isn't rocket science just make sure your system's off when you're swapping these things in and out um it shouldn't really impact graphics card integrity at all so we're going to have to really dive into this one the first thing i think i want to do and i don't usually do this but i think what i want to do right away is take this card out and put it into my system if i can get picture out through this card in my rig then we know it's not a graphics card problem but of course before that we need to plug the system in and see if we can replicate the symptom he's describing here this one's gonna be interesting and i'm not entirely sure i'm gonna have a fixed form if it ends up being the graphics card because i don't have too many of those manufacturers don't like sending cards to youtubers who refuse to make reviews of their cards um yeah i'm just i'm not making videos like that if the card in question isn't being sold at msrp pretty much anywhere or it's not even being sold at all it's out of stock at launch which makes no sense why would you launch a car that's not even in stock at launch um they just don't like sending cards for for for that and i understand right i mean it's their choice at the end of the day they can choose who they want to send review kits to but they want reviews and i refuse to make reviews of cards nobody can buy so that's my stance and as a result i don't have many cards like at all but we might be able to make an exception here if it ends up you know being that this card is bricked so we'll see we need to investigate stay with me signal rgb it's a free one-stop rgb software suite packed with support for hundreds of the best rgb devices from leading brands so you have a corsair memory kit and a gigabyte motherboard but you don't want to control both with separate programs just let signal rgb work its magic synchronize anything from keyboards to pc fans regardless of the manufacture you can even customize lighting effects with various games to set the mood without hassle there are also plenty of uploaded themes so you can kind of play around a bit signalrgb support list for products is growing every single day and you can get started for free by clicking that link below for those who are new to the fixer flop playlist what we do here is attempt to fix viewer systems in and around the orlando florida area for free we don't charge any of these viewers anything to at least take a look at their systems and see what is wrong when it comes to hardware it's pretty much black and white nothing i do here is very difficult there's something special about it you don't need a college degree heck you don't need a high school diploma i know kids who can do the exact same thing i'm doing in this playlist so there's nothing special about me or the situation that i'm in apart from the fact that i can take videos like these monetize them put pre-rolls in them product placements youtube adsense all of that that's how i make my money here which is why i don't offload any of that cost to the viewer it just feels wrong to charge a viewer when he or she is already being gracious enough to loan me the system with which i'll make the video i only asked two things of viewers who loan their systems the first is that they be patient because sometimes this takes five or six days i have to wait for parts to get here if i don't have them on hand and uh yeah there's nothing really i can do there i have to wait for shipping the other thing i ask is that they don't set their expectations too high i don't make any promises about upgrading hardware although we have done that in the past i also don't make any promises about actually being able to fix the system at hand hence why the playlist is called fix or flop most of the time if it's hardware related we can narrow it down and get it fixed but um yeah i'm i'm not gonna make any any promises i've seen a lot and there's a lot that could go wrong at this point we've had dozens of viewer pcs make their way into the studio whether it be for the fix or flop series or the pcdc series and i can't say i've seen too many that look cleaner than this cable management has been taken care of the the hardware is actually very complimentary the graphics card and the cpu as far as i'm aware those are very balanced you can tell the viewer really knew what he was doing when he was assembling this and judging from the age of the hardware i'd say the system is no older than maybe one to two years that said this build is virtually useless one giant paperweight without a picture out and that's what we're going to attempt to diagnose here we're going to plug this into my portable monitor first attempt to replicate the issue described by the viewer and if we do in fact get no picture out from the graphics card i think the first thing i'm going to do in this case is swap this graphics card out with my personal graphics card i'm gonna actually see if this card runs in my in my own rig and if it does then we've ruled out one of the potentially more catastrophic hardware failures in this build again nobody wants to hear that the graphics card has died in 2021 it's like talk about bad timing now as i've said before it is always important to test drive the build when a viewer describes something going wrong you need to make sure that what you see in person is the same thing they're describing if that is not the case then it's possible something else might have happened either in shipping or transport and you don't want to deal with that can of forms especially as a business so i'm going to connect power here and we're going to flip the switch at the rear and let's see let's see what we get everything everything sounds fine everything looks fine but we're not getting picture out i saw that the graphics card fans were spinning they're not spinning now that they have the zero zero rpm function that's perfectly normal leds are all lit up fans are all spinning elsewhere in the build but yeah we're not getting a picture this this could be pretty bad a few moments later who would have thought look at that we have a post and i know you didn't see what just happened between clips because it literally took seconds to do and i was just going to run through this as a precautionary measure i cleared the cmos that's really all i did i just cleared the cmos there's no dedicated clear cmos button on this motherboard this is an x570 board but you have to jump the two pins uh jbhat1jb81 for those interested but this here is a post and all we needed to do to get this system to post was clear that cmos there's actually a debug led little section at the top right of this board and i noticed as we were power cycling there was no led lit up at all for anything the cpu the ram vga none of that was lit up the system looked like it was booting looked like it was trying to post we just had no picture out the leds on the graphics card especially the one above the eight pin uh supplemental pci power connector that was lit up that tells me that the cards receiving power appropriately the fans were spinning everything told me that this build should be working and i noticed that right off the bat the only issue was we weren't getting a picture out i was maybe concerned that it might have been like an hdmi port issue that's very rare but still you know if you're connecting and disconnecting cables all the time i'm sure you could probably screw something up in the long run if you're not careful but uh yeah clear the seamless there you go you know i get some hate in the comments section every now every now and then it's not bad there's just a few people everyone who complain about my troubleshooting process why are you bothering to clear the cmos you should have jumped straight to the power supply you should have known that was a power supply issue relax my friends this is just a i just run through this just as a quick little checklist because it takes literally seconds you're trading seconds for peace of mind because you never know it might come down to just something as simple as clearing the cmos folks that that could be it i've seen it happen so many times and not just in this case here where you're not getting picture out sometimes the build will just flicker on and off and you'll think okay well that's probably a power supply issue why are you not just going straight to the power supply why are you checking ram why are you clearing the cmos because they take seconds to do and you want to roll out those simple fixes first because you're going to really shoot yourself in the foot if you run through a bunch of different hardware swaps only to find out that clearing the cmos was all you needed to do to remedy the issue now at this point mission accomplished right we got a post we fixed the issue that's the point of the fix or flop playlist we could just give this back to the viewer and call it a day but i want to take just a few more minutes to further investigate what exactly was causing the no picture issue i have a feeling that if it's happened to this viewer it could happen to some of you so i've got my own wi-fi card here we're going to connect this to this viewer's build and attempt to replicate the no picture issue we saw earlier in this video i have a good feeling that since all we did essentially by resetting the cmos was reset bios settings there was some setting enabled in the bios by default when he connected his wifi card and when he removed it that setting remained the same and that possibly prevented his card from functioning the way that it should not that running on something like eight lanes would prevent picture out you could run a 2060 on eight lanes no problem that maybe there was some setting that was turned on when this was connected i'm going to see if we can notice the difference here in the bios we're going to check first since everything's vanilla kind of run through make sure it's all good to go should all be set to auto more or less then we'll connect this and see if anything in the bios changed now admittedly this wi-fi card here is not a sketchy one this is a tp-link card and these are actually very good i use these all the time for my builds just want to connect to the internet very quickly not deal with ethernet drivers or anything like that usually this is plug and play but the point should still get across no problem if we connect this i imagine it'll do the same thing to the board that his sketchier wi-fi cord did so this here is the bios again we're going to run through and just make sure that things are all vanilla we'll check settings i'm assuming all this is going to be set to auto let's see cpci subsystems pcie link configuration x16 auto auto auto we can check the overclock tab here let's see so everything is set to auto so with that confirmed all i'm going to do now is power the system back off and connect this wi-fi card and i'm not sure which pcie slot he connected this to we'll try a few of them i think i'm going to start with the second lowest uh smaller probably it's like a four-lane slot we'll see if that does the trick i looked up this motherboard's manual online and confirmed that every pcie slot with the exception of the very top 16 lane slot is controlled by the pch so when he inserted his wi-fi card into one of these more than likely that might have changed one of the default configurations with this 16 lane slot up top and this is the slot where his graphics card is connected so we're going to try the second lowest single lane slot we're going to connect our wi-fi card route the antennae through and it's literally as simple as that right there we won't bother screwing it in we're going to remove it in a second anyway and back in the bios again you can see pcie subsystem settings have not changed we're still at 16 lanes with that uppermost full full-length pcie slot these other two are set to auto these control the pcie generation this is an x570 board so it does support gen 4 and even though our rtx 2060 can't take advantage necessarily the additional bandwidth uh the cpu and the motherboard both support it so that's why when we check on this other page you can see that this slot which is populated with our card is default set to gen 4. so that's confirmed full 16 lanes we can also swing our mouse a bit over here to the left which is actually further down the motherboard and you can see that it says unknown vendor other network controller running it one x or x1 but that's just a single lane there so this is our network card it is detected it is functioning now let's power off and remove the wi-fi card and that's the result we weren't looking for despite this being the end goal so let's try a few more things well i've tried pretty much everything i can think of to screw this up and i can't the system continues to post which is a good thing now at least clearing the scene will fix that but i can't i can't seem to figure out what exactly this viewer did it may have just come down to the type of wi-fi card he had and if it was a very sketchy one maybe it was unbranded or something similar to that uh then that could have been the issue although that's very that's very strange i've never run into that before there are a few other things that i have noted though that i think you should know about as well just in case you're wondering why things work the way they do so i've never run into this issue before with any other motherboard i've ever worked with that i can think of if you click the delete key at just the right time when trying to get into your bios right as the system is attempting to post you'll just end up with a black screen an example here see it's all connected plugged right into the hdmi port at the back of the 2060 here we got nothing this looks awfully similar to what we started with right and it's just because i happen to time the pressing of the delete key improperly that should never happen another slightly more obvious case for a black screen is in the event that you're in your bios and for whatever reason you decide to switch display ports not just display port like dp but also hdmi could be anything we were in one hdmi port and now we're in the other and you can see we now have a black screen no signal that's weird isn't it but it's because i believe the graphics card drivers haven't kicked in yet so it's not like you could run multi displays right you're only getting one display out in a post screen in your bios because the drivers haven't initialized for this graphics card and if you switch that connection to another you know another display out connector like hdmi or if you switch to displayport or whatever without restarting the system if all you're trying to do is get into your bios you get a black screen like this so that's um that's another one just in case you weren't aware funny thing is if you remove that connection and slide the cable back into the original hdmi port you can see we have a picture again so that's kind of cool and to further drive this point home once windows has been loaded into through the boot drive you can see that when we switch hdmi ports now we should still get a picture and see that's because the graphics drivers have already initialized the system hasn't loaded graphics drivers when it's just in the bios because it hasn't booted into the boot drive that has those files in it so that's why this works here and it doesn't work in the bios but all that said you really shouldn't have a system adding a wi-fi card like this one into a build especially if your your motherboard doesn't have built-in wi-fi one of these can come in very handy if you don't have access to a hardwired ethernet connection so don't be afraid of using one of these especially from a name brand like tp-link there are plenty of asus ones and others that are also really good but yeah don't let this single event here scare you away from these they're actually a really good solution if you need wireless connectivity so this is about the point where i would start talking about the long and arduous process we had to go through to get the system working again when in reality all you had to do was clear cmos now it wasn't as easy as just clicking a button with this particular board you do have to physically jump two pins that requires some piece of metal i would recommend using just your phillips head screwdriver if you have one but uh yeah i mean it was very very minimal effort and i'm not gonna try to like sugarcoat it and make it seem like i did more than i did in this video it literally took five seconds and for those who again keep saying why are you clearing your cmos it's obviously this it's obviously that if you see a comment like that in the future just link them this video okay just the proof is in the pudding sometimes it is as simple as clearing your cmos if you are not getting a picture out and you were five seconds earlier the first thing you should do in 99 of cases is clear your cmos it takes two seconds and it just removes that doubt from your mind that it could be something that simple because you're really going to be banging your head against the wall once you find out after swapping tons of hardware that all you had to do was hold a phillips head screwdriver against two pins for about 10 or 15 seconds smaller at the side i'm really glad we didn't have to swap anything out in this build the graphics skirt appears to be in really good shape in fact the entire build for that matter looks to be in great shape at this point i would usually start focusing on cable managing i try to clean these builds up a bit before i return them to their rightful owners but this build is is pretty much already good to go i mean there's a few questionable choices but all in all i mean he did a really good job with the build and i don't see any immediate needs here so yeah i just sent the viewer an email telling him that good news his graphics card is not dead his system is actually fully functional and uh he'll be able to pick it up in a few days now if you enjoy this video despite it not being anywhere near as long as some of our other fictional videos and that's because this only took like 10 seconds to fix and look it's all out there i'm not trying to hide anything or act like it's more intense than it needs to be sometimes the solution is as simple as clearing your cmos i would appreciate you clicking that thumbs up button that goes a long way thank you very much for that support also just watching this far into the video really does help and if you are not subscribed what the heck are you doing get subscribed i'll give you a few seconds how you doing you subscribed yet and i'll catch you in the next one by the way i'm looking at buying a van yeah that's a thing i'm looking at buying a work van that i can use to travel around the country fixing viewer systems for free i think that would be a really cool like fixer flop on tour style series we'll probably just incorporate it into this playlist here it'll just be season two or whatever but with a different premise obviously we're going to you we're driving to your area uh so that we can fix your systems in our van i don't know how well or how not well that's gonna go but um worth a shot and i think you guys will enjoy it either way my my only real issue is just trying to source enough components or like i'll have to pack a lot of components just in case things need to be swapped out etc and when i'm on the road for weeks at a time i'm gonna have to get extra parts sent to me in my van which is not stationary so i'm not sure how that's gonna work either might have to reach out to some friends in the area i happen to be in at the time to see if i can get a hold of those components and then otherwise i'm up to just stuff the van with a bunch of stuff that i might need when i'm troubleshooting swapping things out replacing things and the like i don't know how that's going to go i'm still working it out but i am in early talks i'm looking at some vans and i'm gonna need a van that's big enough to have like a desk in it and um we'll be able to mount some smaller cameras and things i'd like to be able to sleep in it too that'd be pretty cool i would have to buy you know hotel rooms everywhere i go you know anyway it's just just the thought for now we're trying to work out some numbers seeing if it's viable i think it will be at the end of the day it's a flop and i guess that fits with the playlist as well anyway thanks for watching i will catch you in the next one my name is greg thanks for troubleshooting with me",

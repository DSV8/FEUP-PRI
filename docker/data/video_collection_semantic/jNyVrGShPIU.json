    "transcript": "- So Apple just unveiled their brand new Siri-enabled speaker aka HomePod but during the announcement, I couldn't help but think to myself, \"Didn't they already do this?\" (upbeat music) This is Apple's first home audio device, the iPod Hi-Fi. Announced in 2006 by Steve Jobs, the Hi-Fi was a speaker system with a built-in dock designed for iPods using what was then the cutting edge technology of its time, 30-pin. Now looks-wise, this was built to match Apple's design aesthetic which back then was mostly gloss-white. Now because the Hi-Fi was designed for iPods, it came with every adapter you would need to connect but on the back, there was also a aux input so just in case you want to be a rebel, you could also connect you Zune. (menacing music) What kind of made the iPod Hi-Fi unique though, was yes, you could plug it into a wall to power it up just like the HomePod, but... Unlike the HomePod, the iPod Hi-Fi had built-in handles and the reason why it had these, you could actually also power this through D batteries, so Apple at the time must've had some crazy vision of people rocking this outside in public. (hip-hop beat) (record scratching) Now, when comparing the iPod Hi-Fi against the now current HomePod, things get a little crazy. First, the announcements were scary-similar. They stressed audio quality - A ported base reflex design so you can see the ports coming right out the front. We get great base out of this thing and it doesn't distort when you crank it up. - That's automatic base equilization in dynamic software modeling so as we turn the volume up, it's free from distortion. - And in classic Apple fashion, how current products aren't meeting people's needs. - But the problem with these products is that none of them really offer home stereo quality. - Others have worked to make smart speakers that you can talk to but they don't sound so great when you listen music. - Where it gets super crazy though, and I kid you not, the iPod Hi-Fi was released at the exact same price as the current HomePod: $349. - Really more in the iPod economy space at $349. - The HomePod is gonna be priced for $349. - So, it's pretty clear the iPod Hi-Fi and the HomePod have a ton in common and that got me thinking: could I turn the original iPod Hi-Fi into a HomePod? Now, fair warning, this is in no way practical and anyone in their right mind should not try this but for science, let's do it. So, clearly hooking up something like an Echo Dot to an external speaker is the simplest and most practical way to do things but we are not looking for practical. So, the goal here is to get Siri working through the iPod Hi-Fi and the first thing I tried was this very cheap, inexpensive Bluetooth 30-pin adapter. I thought it would look cool, I thought it would match this and kind of keep that 30-pin vibes going. The problem is though, which you will see shortly after I connect and listen to this beautiful, beautiful, beautiful sound. (beep) That's quality. Music will play through the iPod Hi-Fi but if you notice, \"Hey Siri, tell me a joke.\" (phone beeping) - Jonathon, get serious. (chuckling) (deep inhale and sigh) So, the problem was not the joke, it was the fact that the audio came through the phone and not the speaker but I have one more back up plan: the Mpow right-angle adapter. I think that aux connector here is gonna help bring this home...pod. (bleep) (laugh and sigh) Oh well, we'll keep that. So, out is this 30-pin disaster... (clattering to the ground) ...in is the Mpow. Hey Siri, tell me another joke. (phone beeping) - I can't. I always forget the punch line. - It works! It's kind of loud, whoops. (popping sound) Is it supposed to pop? Hey Siri, tell me another joke. (phone beeping) - Jonathon, I don't really know any good jokes, none in fact - So, it kind of sounds like this, punch me in the stomach, but sounds definitely came through this. It's not the smoothest or the easiest way but we got Hey Siri working through the iPod Hi-Fi. Now, it is time for the music test. Hey Siri, play Everyday Bro. I'm kidding! - No! (loud bang) Ahh! - Siri jokes are one thing but music is another. Hey Siri, play Whitney Myer \"I'm the One\". Yeah you're looking at the truth, the money never lie no I'm the one yeah, I'm the one - Volume works Early mornin in the dawn, know you wanna ride now I'm the one yeah - Oh it gets loud I'm the one yeah, I'm the one yeah! And you're sick of all those other imitators Don't let the only real one intimidate ya See you watchin, don't run outta time now I'm the one yeah, I'm the one yeah! Shorty's like a melody in my head that I can't keep out Got me singing like, na-na-na-na everyday, It's like my iPod's stuck on replay, replay Got me singing like - That's really, really, really, really, really, really loud So, that was about 60% volume. Honestly, I'm a little scared to turn this to a 100. It might blow my ears right off. It was way, way louder than I thought it would be and it also sounded better than I assumed it would be, especially for a product that was announced way back in 2006 and quickly discontinued in 2007 so is this practical? Absolutely not but what do I know. Maybe you happen to have one of these iPod Hi-Fis laying around your homes, I am looking at you, DetroitBORG. Now, all you gotta do is add a very simple, inexpensive Bluetooth adapter and you can turn your iPod Hi-Fi into a HomePod...kinda. - Yeah I did that (laughing)",

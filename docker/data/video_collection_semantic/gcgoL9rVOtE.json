    "transcript": "- Matt, I have a question for you. - What? - Are you ready? - No. - I can't hear you. - (yells) No. - (yells) Oh, it's time to get into some Target tech hauls, my friend. Today, I have a special surprise. Matt, have you heard of a little known retailer known as Tar-get? Tar, Tar-get? I don't know Tar-get, I know Targ. - Ah, yes, that's the one. - Right. - And Matt, I have got bags of tech down here. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You have stuff? - I am the captain now. - If you're gonna play us, I gotta play, play you then, right? - No. - Okay, so I just... - Matt, where are you going? - Hello, and welcome. Today, we have some mysterious target-ology. - I'd like to apologize to our dear viewers for what you just witnessed. I take no responsibility for Matt's actions. (beep sounds) (Matt laughs) Matt, are you familiar with the Heyday brand? This is Target's house brand for tech, I guess. So I have a wide variety of products for our dear friend Matt to evaluate today, and he knows nothing about anything, and he also doesn't know the prices. So that's part of the game is you gotta figure out how much we paid. - Hassled. - Stop it, Matt. Here's the thing, this is designed, it's got a little like clip on it. - To go on... - So you can just toss it on your bag, it's an adorable accessory. - We just kind of. - Yeah. - Look at that, I mean, it's probably better for a backpack, but sure, okay. - Yeah, no, like I can, or I can... Let's test this bad boy out. - All right. Evaluate, Matt, how do you feel about the performance of this very short, very odd cable? - Already, it's just awkward to plug in. - It works, though. - But it's charging. - How much would you pay for this modern marvel of fashion and tech fused into one beautiful package? - $9.99. - Kenzie? - $14.99. - $14.99? - You know what, that's not actually that bad. It's a really short cable. It's cool to have on your backpack, but like... - You know what else is cool? - What else is cool? Oh, I am loving this little brand detail, it's just a smiley face. - You need help? - Pull him argh. Okay, so it does come with a charging brick, so it already beats Apple. - This is a full MagSafe-compatible charging stand which is designed to go on your desk or something and actually keep your phone upright. - All right, well, already it's gonna get points off. - Mm. - Because it's got an attached cable to it. - It does have some cable management built into the bottom, though. - It does. You can kind of just flick. - Don't use that word. - Flick. All right, here we go, the moment of truth. - Wow. - Um. I mean, it is actually MagSafe, which is nice. - Works great. I will say that this is not a satisfying, try that. - Hmm. - Like if you had the max, I think this would actually tip over. - Matt, how much would you pay for the Target-branded MagSafe charging stand? - I'm gonna say $49.99. - You are dead on. - Dead on. Am I better - Absolutely not. - at guessing prices than you? Um, I'm pretty close. - Matt gives himself 30 points. - Yeah, 30 points, right now. (bell rings) - That's not how this works. Aron, take those 30 points back. - Now gimme double that because I got points. - You know what you are a certified expert at? - Legos. - And audio. So I have purchased you a high-quality set of headphones from our friends over at Tar-get. - They are very cheap feeling. Okay. All right, pop this bad boy in here. (playful music) - You see that face? That's the face of someone who's mildly impressed. - They're not amazing. This is not like a new find. But like that sounds pretty, pretty good. (playful music repeats) It's way better than I thought it was gonna sound. I was expecting this to be very tinny. - Yeah, it's literally the opposite. - I'm gonna say that these were $9.99. - Kenzie? - Yes. - Two for three, and only a couple dollars off on the third one, 50 points for Matt. (bell rings) - Stop giving yourself points, the points don't even matter. - Doesn't matter. Ka-ching. (bell rings again) Aron has to do it right there because I made the sound effect. No, he doesn't, actually. - If someone who didn't know you walked up and said, \"Hey Matt, what's your job?\" How would you describe it? (Matt laughs) That's not the answer I wanted to hear. (laughs) - I have no idea how to answer that question, because I just like, I make tech YouTube. - You know what you need to make tech YouTube videos? Clip-on microphone. - Okay. - This is a clip-on microphone designed to give you a better aural experience. Aurally, this is an amazing product that is going to up... - Okay, point, removable cable. I am a sucker for a Brady cable. (thud is heard) It's got a magnetic clip. - That's satisfying. - Yeah, like one, it is very satisfying. Side note, if you are a fidgety person, don't fidget with your microphone while it's on. We're gonna test out the mic. Hello and welcome to \"This Is\", this is instantly peeking on this. - [Matt's Recorded Voice] Welcome to \"This Is\", this is instantly peaking. - That ain't it, chief. - Make your TikTok voice. - Today, we're gonna be dealing with some keyboards. I heard that if you wanna have your keyboards lubed just stick 'em in some Vaseline. That's my TikTok voice. - Do it on TikTok, make a TikTok. - We're gonna make this in real time together. Hello and welcome to \"This Is\", I am testing out a microphone for a video. Go check out that video, it's probably been, no, wait, it won't be live - It's not live yet. for a while, - because we never take- - It's not live, I'm talking into your microphone right now. - We don't, we don't. Envy. - I feel better about that now. - What I think about this is very much gonna be dependent on the pricing of it. $ 14.99. - $19.99. - For 20 bucks this isn't worth it, because I think the microphone on your phone is probably gonna sound better in most cases - Matt, what do you need in your life? Wireless earbuds, that's what you need. - I'm very happy that you didn't let me finish that one. (Austin laughs) Because this one's about to get sad. - Oh no. - These are AirPod adjacent. Ugh, they are not comfortable. Do you like pizza - Already, they sound like (voice squawks). They don't, they don't wanna pair. - You couldn't even get 'em to pair, you've already given up? - I will tell you that they are so uncomfortable to have in my ear, that I don't care how cheap these are, I'm guessing these were $24.99 - $10. - For 10 bucks for truly wireless headphones, maybe. The pairing noise was the tinniest thing I've ever heard. - How about some better headphones? These are wireless, active noise-canceling Bluetooth headphones. They're very adorable. - A little design on them. - 33 foot Bluetooth range. Eight hours of battery. - The top case is like flimsy, but actually putting them in is a nice little... - [Aron's Voice] These two chuckleheads forgot to mention the price, which was $79.99. - All right, speaking of nothing but headphones, how about a on-ear wireless headset? - This is like basically a napkin. That's what this box is. (groove music) - Don't tell us, you have record with a voice memo how you feel. - So these ones sound a lot better than the other ones. It's much more balanced, there's still a lot of bass on them. They are surprisingly comfortable to wear. I thought they were gonna hurt, to be honest. Now, let's hear what they sound like, though. - [Matt's Recorded Voice] What I feel about the- - Oh, okay. - This mic is also detachable, Matt. - [Matt's Recorded Voice] So these ones sound a lot- - This sounds great. We found a gem. - How much would you pay for this high-quality headphone? - I'm gonna swing low, hoping that I'm right. $35. - They're normally $35, but - Normally - he got them on sale for $10.49. - $10,49, shut up, stop watching this video, go to your nearest Targ and pick this up. Your Twitch stream sucks because your audio sucks, get these and they we'll improve it immediately. This sounds really good. - Matt, is this the point where you tell me I did a good job? - You actually did a good job. - (whispers) Yes. - Now show me the rest of the garbage that you got. - Let me see your phone. Ugh, this is disgusting. You know what you need? You need a UV sanitizer to clean out this disgusting phone. (Matt laughs) When was the last time you washed your phone? - It's probably dirtier than normal, because I take it in the shower. - I just touched that. - It's clean, it was in the shower. - That's not, no, no. - Give it a little scrub-a-dub. - That's definitely not how it works. (laughs) - I like to have my shower concert. - No, no, no, no. (hushes) - So if your phone is a little crusty, boy... - Well, no, so it kills germs, not crustiness. Also, you touch your phone more than you touch- - This thing could fit... - -anything else in your life. - Everything. All right, you just hold that down. Nope. (Austin snickers) - Matt, did you not read the instructions? - Nope. - Did you learn... - There we go. - So this actually is a real thing. So it uses UV light to, basically, destroy the germs on your phone. Now it might seem like a reasonable thing to be a little skeptical of. I've never like properly tested it, but actually I have one of these at home, so usually, a few times a week I'll put my phone in there. I'll make sure that it's nice and clean. But Matt, how much would you pay for this phone-sanitizing piece of technology that is real, mostly? - This particular one, what? $49.99? - $35. - I think $35 is overpriced for this. All right, hit me with your best shot, fire away. - Would you consider yourself to be a sophisticated gentleman? - No, not at all. I eat chickey nuggies, and... - Let me rephrase the question, Matt, do you think you're a man of style? - No, I wear the same four shirts in every video. - Matt, are you someone who likes to stay on top of the latest cutting edge trends? - Not particularly, I'm usually several weeks behind. - Matt, do you wear an Apple Watch? Cool. - Yeah. - I got you an Apple Watch band. - All right, okay. - So you might be able to go to your friendly local Apple Store and give them about half a kidney to purchase a new watch band for your shiny apple watch. However, our friends at Target have you covered with the Heyday You Do Hue. - I mean, the colorway is not particularly great for the blue. This doesn't feel good. It's like pulling on my arm hair. If this was any more than $5, I'd say this is overpriced - $10. - Not it, not it. - Oh wow, what's that, Matt? - It's a computer. - What do you do with that? - Mostly, just look at sad things on the internet. - You can look at sad things on the internet with a wireless keyboard. This is a fully wireless Bluetooth 5.1 keyboard. What do you think about the color? - I feel like this is hype beast approved 'cuz it's a nice off-white. In all seriousness, I don't like this color at all. I think this looks like a white keyboard that's been left out in the sun. - Well, at least it's Bluetooth and USB, it comes with a USB dongle. - This, apparently, can do multiple devices. - Two Bluetooth devices or the USB. It'll also automatically detect your operating system and switch the layout accordingly. - See, look at that. - So you can go back and- - when you switch. - Bluetooth actually worked on this. Subscribe to \"This Is\". This feels awful. - It feels bad. - It just, it's like mush central. - Matt, what would you pay for this high quality? - I have a controversial take, I mean five bucks. I'm gonna say that you paid $19.99 for this. - Kenzie, would you care to fill our friend in on how much this actually cost? $ 39.99. - Absolutely not, there is in no world that I would pay $40 for this keyboard. You can get the Logitech ones for the same price, that have the same features. - Okay, yeah, look, this is bad. I'll just, this is bad. - It's bad, it's bad. - Would you say that today has been a journey? - I would say it's been something. - That's exactly what I wanted to hear, because Matt, I wanna help improve of your life. I wanna help get you to the next level by picking out an item that it is so audacious to have found at Target. Do you know what that item is, Matt? - My will to live? - It is a desktop microphone. It's a cardioid condensing microphone. - I think you oversold this one a little bit for improving my life. - Look at that. You get yourself a little tripod, you could put anything on that. You could match your will to live on that. I just realized that it's meant to be upside down. (laughs) Hey Matt, do you need some headphones? - I guess I do need some headphones. Okay, so I guess the scenario is this has a really good mic on it. Oh no, I lost it. So now I have this guy. - This actually is a fairly high, like, quality set of features. You've got USBC, you've got a headphone jack out. You have a little dial for your volume control as well as a physical mute button. (whispers) Can you hear me right now? - I can. - (whispers) Are you recording? - You can just talk right into it. - Mm. (grumbles) - This doesn't sound terrible. Let us know what you think in the comments whether this is garbage or whatnot. - Subscribe to \"This Is\", subscribe to \"This Is\". - And then- - Subscribe to \"This Is\". - -let us know what else you want us to find at Target. I, you know... - Subscribe to \"This is\", subscribe to \"This Is\".",

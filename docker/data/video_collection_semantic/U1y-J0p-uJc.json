    "transcript": "so the day that everyone seems to be waiting for is finally here MD is officially launching their rx 5000 series GPUs and boy has it been an interesting few weeks you see this all started at e3 when AMD showed off their shiny new Navi GPUs particularly the rx 5000 series and then team green had to respond with their rtx super cards that sort of set a benchmark as to what these cards are kind of competing with just a couple days ago before this launch aim D throw an interesting curveball a test with price cuts on these new GPUs at launch this is just a typical aim the thing I'm not really surprised but now after more than a year of rumors we can finally talk about how the RX 5700 XT and the 5700 perform in benchmarks are they actually worth buying over the Arctic super cards that team green launched just last week to be honest with you a lot of this video had to be redone just because of AMD's new lower prices on these graphics cards so let's talk about that right after a quick word from our sponsor looking for a solid board to pair your 9 gen CPU the azrog Z 390 Taichi gets it right with robust vrm designs for extreme overclocking a 12 phase power design for smooth power delivery dual band Wi-Fi 3m 2 slots and reinforced PCI connectors learn more about it down below alright so if you want a bit more information about these new GPUs specifically with the architecture you can actually check out our explain video right over here but in this video I'm gonna be focusing a lot more on the performance benchmarks and not really get into the other stuff and also since a lot of you guys have been asking I'll make sure to leave timestamps in the description down below so let's do a quick spec recap on both of these new GPUs so they're based off the Navi 10 core and use a seven nanometer manufacturing process the RX 5700 XT will have 2560 stream processors eight gigabytes of gddr3 with 448 gigabytes per second of bandwidth aboard power of 225 watts and now a lower price of $400 u.s. its base and game frequencies are 1605 megahertz and 1750 5 megahertz respectively the RX 5700 gets cut down to a little over 2,000 stream processors and frequencies which lowers voice hour to about 180 watts it still gets eight gigabytes of gddr3 hundred and fifty dollars us now about that new pricing it's really made things interesting because after seeing how Nvidia's RTX video cards perform I think AMD might have come to a realization that they priced these new GPUs a little too high especially if you consider when those new RTX super cards come with two free games so this is how things line up right now the rx 5700 XT is a whole hundred dollars cheaper than the RTX 2070 super making it the exact same price as the RTX 2060 super the RX 5700's price is about the same as the RTX 2060 another thing a lot of people have brought up is how used gtx 980 ti cards cost around 300-400 dollars these days I'd be a bit worried of getting one that's been abused in countless hours of cryptocurrency mining but yeah that's another option if you're willing to take the risk let's take a look at the cards to see what you're getting since at launch there won't be any custom designs which is unfortunate those will be available to buy a month or more afterwards starting with the 5700 XT it's one good-looking graphics card with a swooping heatsink shroud that almost looks dented but that design is supposed to increase internal airflow and lower the amount of noise to flipping the card around there's a full-coverage backplate that uses the same cool rib design as the top shroud but this time it's broken up by a smooth area along with a red strip one of our concerns with these blower style cards is that they're always fighting for air flow but the RX 5700 XT's back edge is actually pretty open which should increase the amount of air it can draw in but personally my favorite angle of this card is from the edge which has the glowing Radeon logo it looks clean and really well done and that's where the eight plus six pen power connectors are for output AMD has kept it pretty simple with three DisplayPort 1.4 B connectors and a single HDMI 2.0 B on both cards now by comparison to the XT the RX 5700 is almost boring basically the entire shroud is a uniform gray with the red Radeon text and a small amount of silver around the honestly I think AMD should have added a back plate here since the rtx 2060 and the rtx 2060 super founders editions have cool-looking back plates this just looks cheap in my opinion and another big concern is that aim these designers chose to close the back edge which kills airflow this is just another opposition since adding a secondary intake area should have been a no-brainer wrapping things up the power connectors are identical to the 5700 XT with an 8 plus 6 pin layout now looking at these cards it's pretty easy to be concerned about acoustic performance especially since blowers tell coolers are always louder than downdraft coolers like these so let's take a listen to all of these GPUs at load since during idle scenarios all of them are super quiet so it's obvious that the RX cards are lot louder than the rtx super series but this is all fan noise luckily there wasn't any coil whine on the AMD GPUs which is certainly good news but I do want to mention that the coil one on the rtx 2060 super certainly did influence its results which is just too bad I also want to quickly look at power consumption because AMD has made a lot of progress with their seven nanometer manufacturing process but is it enough so this is actually pretty interesting since it looks like be 5700 series has nearly closed the gap but that isn't necessarily good news remember Nvidia is still on 12 nanometer and it took a super-efficient 790 meter process for AMD to draw even at least this time anyone who buys a Radeon card won't have to worry about super high power draw so I think it's time to talk about how these cards stack up but I'm gonna start things a little bit differently this time starting with the overall performance benchmark list and if you want to know how we acquired those numbers the individual game performance will follow right afterwards so this is what things look like after a dozen of games being tested and you can actually see why AMD reduced their prices you'll see in the next few minutes that knobby's performance is very strong against invidious rtx 2070 and the 2060 but the Super Series is very different in raw numbers the RX 5700 XT loses by about 12% overall to the rtx 2070 super and the RX 5700 sits right in between the RTX 2060 and the RTX 2060 super there is really nothing to complain about here since all of these are really strong numbers but hold on when it comes to raw value AMD actually leads by a pretty big margin the RX 5700 XT new $400 price causes it to just dominate the $500 RTX 2070 super even the RX 5700 looks pretty good against the RTX 2060 super I mean it doesn't offer more performance but it does cost a whole 50 dollars less while also beating the vanilla RTX 2060 by about 7% like I said in the RTX super review the pricing of these two RTX 2060 cards is just way too high right now also guys do keep in mind that the GTX 1080 TI provides almost similar performance to the rtx 2080 so if you can find that GPU for $400 or less it would blow any of these cards right out of the water but as I mentioned earlier be aware of the mining cards in the used market so where does this leave the rx 5700 XT and the rx 5700 well other than the average frame rates I already mentioned during testing we also notice that their lower 1% frame rates were all over the place in some games like Battlefield 5 they easily beat the Nvidia cars but in some really popular titles like fortnight pubG and Total War they really liked pretty far behind so obviously consistency is still an issue for AMD so the big question is whether or not if you should buy the rx 5700 series over GeForce rtx and the answer to that really depends on what you think of invidious features like rate racing DL SS and content adaptive shading you see if you only care about standard game rendering the arcs 57-hundred xt is a better buy than the RTX 2070 super and the same can be said about the rx 5700 versus the RTX 2060 super but this is important you can't just ignore what Nvidia has to offer especially since a lot of these games are including waitressing elements and performance is improving so that does count for something so there you guys have it and I certainly think Amy's on the right track it's just that they have a lot of catching up to do but I really want to know thoughts about all of this do you still think these cards are too expensive or is there one that you look into are there any other games or tests that you'd like us to run definitely let us know in the comments down below I'm you go with hurricane axe thank you so much for watching make sure to check out certain relevant content over here subscribe for some cool content coming the pipeline I'm sliding off and I'll see you guys in the next one",

    "transcript": "now it's been about 2 years since I've done a video like this where we just go onto the internet and buy content basically for videos so I'm pretty excited to do it although this time I've done a cursory look on Amazon so far even though that's not the main place we're going to look but buying a PC Today is much more of a Minefield than it was 2 years ago what is all of this stuff like if you're just a filthy casual looking to get into PC gaming how are you supposed to figure out what to buy here you need like a Zetta stone for terrible gaming PCs to decipher this madness before if you wanted this kind of confusion you would just go on to eBay and then get scammed into buying one of these things but that's not even the case anymore now it happens on Amazon and it gets more confusing because you go on to you go onto this you click on it the same seller has five different versions of this Optiplex thing that we've we've had a look at various iterations of on the channel but it's gotten more confusing because for $39 Canadian dollar you can buy one with an rx550 in it but if you're feeling a little bit spendy and you want to blow some more money if you go up to this one for $40 more it is a gt750 in it so you're paying more money for a worse graphics card let's see what happens here 380 oh so this one is a 550 with an i7 in it um what happens over here oh you actually get a 1050 TI in it for but I mean it's still the point is if you don't know what you're looking at how are you supposed to decide what to buy here and the thing is this kind of price point it's really difficult to kind of recommend an alternative cuz if you go and look for an Optiplex that hasn't been like gamer swagged up and then you want to drop your own graphics card in it you realize that like low profile graphics card prices still look like this you're still looking at paying 230 CAD for an RX 6400 okay let's quickly do the math here as you can see I'm on on I'm on firefox's porno Vision so that I don't accidentally leak my address so the MSRP of this Graphics carde was supposed to be 10 oh that is what it costs this is like a reasonable price for it but then you're looking at dropping one of these in an Optiplex so let's say it's about 300 for the alplex it's about 220 for the 6400 that's over 500 Canadian dollars that you're paying for the system and is it worth paying that amount for that kind of configuration so in my opinion and this may be a bit controversial considering that I have a PC gaming channel essentially if I had less than 500 C to spend on a gaming PC I'd buy an Xbox series S I don't know I I feel like this is probably the way to go wait is this all still part of the intro I guess that means we need to play the ad and then we'll actually go shopping for Content now that I've got that right out of the way today's video is sponsored by corsair's new IQ link McGuffin being able to daisy chain all of your RGB and fans together with a single cable run makes life so much easier I recently swapped a bunch of IQ link fans into a test system and had a great frustration free time magneting everything together and because of all the heartache I saved dealing with RGB clutter I didn't blow an artery struggling with a corrupt Windows install so if you want a great looking easy to ous premium RGB solution check out IQ link using the link in the video [Music] description so now that I've had a bit of a rant about the mine field that is Amazon when it comes to gaming PC shopping let's go and have a look at eBay for Content I'm curious to see how it Compares now to the new eBay which is Amazon so if you just say search PC gaming it's like the same St stuff but here you're getting an RTX 2060 see that's where they get you it's a second gen i7 so I think by that they mean a 2600 which is not a good match for an RTX 2060 I can tell you that in fact I very recently dropped various new graphics cards into a system with one of those in it and it didn't go great okay eBay eBay still is a hell hole this is just Intel Dark Ages quad core Intel Dark Ages quad core again Intel Dark Ages quad core Until Dark Ages quad war and it's just this is this is all that there this is just all of it oh so here you actually get to choose the graphics card so if you choose it's $880 Canadian dollar for an RX 550 with some i7 in it let me let me guess it's a second gen oh never mind it's Sixth Gen so a 6700 but that is a lot lot for a PC with an RX 550 in it it's because they know how the buzzwords work you know you put i7 and like the biggest in video graphics card name you can fit in the price point in the title and then somebody's going to think it's a good deal but okay let's do four parts and see what kind of deadish nondescript PCS we can find cuz this is always a fun video trying to figure out how to make these systems work that's a very interesting shot of them to use for the main picture the PC it's just like the back of some Wi-Fi antenna oh oh look at that it's an old Alienware so this is something that I am quite interested in looking at because this old Alienware actually has nonproprietary kind of shaped Parts in it so I could do a video where I buy one of these in cyborg green and then turn it into like a crazy modern gaming system uh one thing that I am curious about in terms of of radiator space there's not a whole lot we can do to this system but putting that aside I just noticed this has quite interesting Hardware in it this looks like an 8800 GTX going off the Dual connectors here this thing was a complete beast when it initially came out what is the CPU yeah so 8800 GTX with Core 2 CPU but going by the 2.1 GHz it's like a an e6400 oh this thing looks fascinating okay I'm almost going to buy this without your input but we'll see let me know in the comment section down below if you want to see something like this I then spent a while combing through a bunch of eBay listings of broken systems with a suspicious amount of broken Intel KN but the wildness of the eBay listings were starting to grow tiresome as you can tell by the degrading state of my hair you can't say that it runs great but also doesn't turn on anyway had a look at a bunch of this stuff let's go on to AliExpress which is one one of my favorite places to shop for random PC crap and there's actually some stuff that I have in mind for this cuz there's been some interesting laptops and things on AliExpress that I may want to check out but again we're just going to type in PC gaming whoa look at this thing so this little guy has a 12 900h and a 3050 TI in it which as far as I understand is like a mobile version of the GPU but that is a beast of a hardware configuration for this kind of little thing so if we go for the yeah that goes to a th000 with no storage in it but that does look re oh going to have I I censored that this looks really exciting every time I go on to AliExpress I see this thing recommended I really want to buy it cuz I'm very curious to see what the cooling solution looks like in it and what kind of power we're getting so let me know in the comment section down below if I should get one of these and what configuration we're looking at see there's a whole lot of them and then you also get like these systems which has the coolest looking power button on it ever I actually think this was in the last one of these online shopping videos that I did and uh I there's something about the power button on it that really draws me in but what's more interesting you can get them with some of the new AMD uh kind of like mobile chips in it got a 680m in it which as far as I understand is a very power powerful integrated GPU so this could also be interesting uh cuz it's a much cheaper alternative but it's not going to be nearly as powerful as the the the this one um but let's see wow this is actually mostly mini PCS y look at these mice look at this one this looks like an old rat gaming mouse this is another one maybe I should do like a gaming mouse Roundup off AliExpress cuz there seems to be some crazy examples of them popping up everywhere wo that's pretty cool it's even got the the Apple cheese grater effect on the side but this has a 6600m in it this thing looks like a beast aiming on this thing must be wild oh there's a lot that we need to sensor here oh no but so this doesn't actually have any hardware in it as far as I understand supports VGA 800x 600 resolution I mean for people that know more about this stuff than I do is rs23 2 compatible with just normal VGA stuff I mean I can probably Google it but this seems like it would be the ultimate gaming peripheral because you've got your like mouse bit although it doesn't have a click which may be a bit of a problem but you've got your like Mouse control bit and then you can bind all of the keys for like actual gaming purposes that looks really cool oh yeah yeah yeah oh oh oh okay okay so the thing that I wanted to show you which then sent me down a wild rabbit hole of look looking for a thing I once saw on AliExpress it's on my phone right so I'm going to I'll screen capture this but you can see it's got like what looks like a full mechanical keyboard in it with like very interesting speakers and stuff and then a 1440p display 16 in but it costs 500 CAD like look at that thing oh but it's it's got a seller on in it so it means it's going to be really good for gaming as well okay so that was the one thing that I've been looking for now this is something that Asus has been doing for a while but it seems like there's a lot of AliExpress options for these so you see something like this which I mean I I just really want to see the AliExpress implementation of something like this uh because th this is I mean it's got quite old Hardware in it but if you spec it with kind of Less storage and stuff like it's not that expensive I then got distracted Again by the the bizarre world of AliExpress Hi-Fi product some really weird knockoff stuff on there but eventually I managed to pull myself back on the topic look at this thing it's like a really cheap version of the RTX A2000 but it doesn't quite make sense cuz it's got like a different memory configuration so is it just the same chip oh this is this is the brand of like Ali Express necrom monster graphics card makers but just like that I got distracted again getting back on track I I don't know how I ended up on farm machinery so this is like a foldable phone that you can buy on AliExpress but instead of having the main display on the inside that you open up the get to you've just got like a folded around main display on the outside and it's like 460 CAD for a foldable phone look at that look at how big the fold is what a stupid looking device oh I really want to check that out as well now I've been on and off looking at temu for stuff and I just I can't find gaming stuff cuz as you can see here it just wants us to buy panties and woman's underwear for some reason but let's see if we can get like graphics card the only option and this is a recent Edition is something like a gt610 but I don't even think that's going to make an interesting graphics card oh they also have what looks like one of the best connect like adapters I've ever seen look at that yeah there isn't really anything interesting on here yeah the pre-built Market has stagnated so hard I feel like 2023 we're back at the point where like if you need a gaming PC you have to build it like look at this the new Acer loser Nitro suckface Edition 1,800 CAD for a system with a 360 in it and a 13400 a 3050 and a 5600 G 1,000 500 CAD I don't know how you buy a PC as somebody that's just into prils at the moment I then headed over to NZXT site which seemed a lot more promising oh that's pretty cool on NZXT site they have an a770 based preil for about $1,000 which pricing wise seems pretty good compared to what we were seeing on Best Buy and it's cool that they have that option available oh the new Alienware looks so lame and pedestrian it seems to have better ventilation but it just looks like a PC yeah I don't know I feel like an Alienware system needs to look like a 13-year-old designed it and then it was built to the lowest bidder not just this also the cheapest configuration is about 1,800 CAD for a system with a 4060 and a 30700 which is air cooled in it I I'd love to see what the air cooler in that system looks like considering that they very suspiciously don't show you any pictures of it which I think brings me to the end of the video I wasn't expecting to make today I was busy with with a different video which didn't pan out at all terrible things happen Okay so we're we're going back to the other adapter now but that oh that doesn't fit I bought so many adapters but none of them are going to work and I am going on holiday for about 2 to 3 weeks so you won't see any more videos from me for a while and then when I come back we're going to see the conclusion of that Madness and hopefully a bunch more content on this stuff that we looked at today so let me know what want to see videos on and until the next video byebye",

    "transcript": "Today we have the OnePlus 3... T. With improved processing, a better camera, and a bigger battery. It is a fantastic cash grab for OnePlus Team right before the holidays; excellent business decision. It'll be interesting to see how all these new features got crammed into the exact same body design of the old OnePlus 3. Lets hope that the bright red box signifies the return of the iconic red OnePlus battery. Its time to open it up, and find out. [Intro] The only external physical difference between the oneplus 3 and the 3T is a slight change in color, and now The OnePlus claims to have a sapphire camera lens. I have a few tools for testing sapphire. The first is the diamond selector tool. You can see that the crystal lens of the 3T is indeed registering as sapphire. If I take the same tool and press it to the glass lens of the older OnePlus 3, nothing happens. I can check the hardness of the sapphire with my Mohs Picks. Real pure sapphire should register as an 8 or 9 on Mohs Scale of Hardness. Regular glass will scratch at a level 6. The point of having a sapphire lens is to reduce scratching. I can almost feel the level 7 pick catching on the lens, but the level 8 pick is where we start to see some damage. This is exactly where my sapphire crystal Tissot watch scored as well. So big thumbs up to OnePlus for using quality sapphire. Now since OnePlus is just reusing the exact same body and frame as the OnePlus 3, my durability test still stands for this new version. Physically, it is the exact same phone. Even the opening up this new phone is the exact same process as my original OnePlus 3 teardown video, Ill link the videos both of those videos at the end of this one, and in the video description if you're curious. As the back aluminum shell falls off the OnePlus 3T I am met with crushing disappointment at the lack of red battery that was so prominent in the oneplus 2, and the original oneplus phones. The 3T even has a green pull tab. Like for real. Green? That's the farthest from red you can get. I don't know how those engineers sleep at night. Side by side, it would be almost impossible to tell the phones apart just by looking at them. The frustratingly green colored pull tab is the only indicator that something has changed. Both cameras still have OIS, and you can see all of the mill lines on the solid aluminum rear back panel. This is a very sturdy phone. When you get up close and personal with the batteries though, you can see that the original 3 has a 3000 mAh battery and the new 3T battery has 3400 mAh capacity. Quite the capacity jump with the exact same physical dimensions. Even the part that connects to the main board is the same size. The 3t battery fits perfectly into the frame of the older OnePlus 3, and the phone even turns on when connected. And functions like normal with the larger capacity battery inside. The only problem is when I check the battery capacity with 5 different applications, they all claim that the new battery to only be 3000 mAh. It doesn't recognize the extra capacity on a software level. So... depending on how OnePlus has their charging set up, it might never fully charge the battery all the way, because it's design to stop at 3000 to prevent over charging. This could be easily fixed on a software level with an update. But Its probably never going to happen. Thats unfortunate though, cuz it would be a fun little upgrade for the OnePlus 3 owners who need to replace their original batteries in a few years. For the record, I did reassemble the OnePlus 3T with the correct battery and the battery capacity did register at the full 3400. But it was probably pulling from the software information as well. Either way it was a fun experiment. I don't need two OnePlus 3's. Which is an incredibly weird sentence to say mathematically, So ill be giving away the One Plus 3T on my twitter. Just like and retweet this tweet to enter. It has a few scratches on the camera lens... but the jerry signature adds at least 30 more megapixels. If you wanna see the durability test or teardown of the original OnePlus three check out these videos! And follow me on instagram and twitter for all the behind the scenes. My Twitter followers saw the guts of this phone before anyone else in the world. Thanks for watching! Ill see you around.",

    "transcript": "We're starting to realize we made a pretty big mistake with the pumpkins. Apparently they expand. [Music] [Cambry] Hello there! [Zack] Nice. So today's video is going to be a little bit different. You might remember earlier this year we built a massive raised vegetable garden for my wife, Cambry...and me, of course. -And we learned a lot about what we should and shouldn't do, and we filmed the whole thing. Let's get started. [Intro] -So it has now been 6 weeks since we planted the garden and we're going to do a short little update. As you can see there are a lot of things growing...more than we anticipated. And the pumpkins are insane. But, let's start at the other end and talk about what we have. -On the left we have your lettuce. I don't know the variety but it's tasty in our salads. We still have a lot to harvest. Then we have our cucumbers. We're definitely going to have to thin these suckers out because look how many we have. Zucchinis and squash. This is a spaghetti squash. We have at least 3 on this...or 4. Wow. This plant's doing well. Then we've got our sugar snap peas. -This one we learned that if we watered the leaves in the middle of the day they get, like, sunburned. So we've had to be really careful to just make sure the water goes down there. Or just water it really early in the morning so they don't get burned. -Okay, so we've got on the end there, close to Zack are our peppers. I think they're bell peppers. Then we've got this row of artichokes. -This guy is a jalapeno. So we have that one, and we have two little guys over here on the other side. -Over here is our green beans. That plant's doing well, but they were attacked by birds earlier in the season so they're still a little small. We've got over here our onions. We have two varieties...I forget which ones, but one variety here and one variety there. And then I'm really excited about these carrots. They don't look like much but I'm really excited to harvest them and give them to my horse. She will love them. -I thought we were going to eat the carrots. -You don't eat carrots. Okay. -Vegetables are the worst. -Then we've got our potato plants here that I feel like they've been this same size for like the last month. They just grew super rapidly and then have been hanging out at this size for about a month. Onto row number three. Four rows of our brussel sprouts. Never seen these guys grow but I think the brussel sprouts grow like near the bottom, so we'll keep our eyes peeled on that. Not entirely sure. -These right here are giant sequoias that I got for $6 a piece on Amazon. They're not supposed to grow in Utah, but I don't know...we'll see what happens. -They're doing alright. Then we've got two different varieties of watermelon. We've got a smaller, mini watermelon on this side and then a larger one that you just get from the store I think. And then on the end we've got our baby forest of asparagus. -Then we have our corn over there not doing as well as we hoped, but it is getting tall. And then finally we have two varieties of pumpkins, both of them are massive, and we planted way too many. So we're going to keep watering...[chickens balking]...and keep feeding the chickens. What will be a slow time for us will pass really fast for you guys. Alright Cambry, is this our first harvest? -Yeah, pretty much. Yeah, our beans struggled. They got a lot of sun and we think next year we need to put them in partial shade. But we still get to harvest some so that's kind of fun. -So are we supposed to eat these just like normal? -You gotta wash them. -They taste like a vegetable. Not that bad. Tastes fresh. As you can see we're missing our barn now. It's completely gone. We are, hopefully by the time we publish this video we will have a new building in place that actually has a spot for horses inside. Cambry is going to be excited about that. We also have one tiny jalapeno plant. So I'm going to go ahead and...I'm not sure why that one's red. So I'm going to go ahead and pick these. Cambry said since I ate a sweet pea, now it's time to... -Time to try a jalapeno! -Bite a jalapeno! We're going to save this for some pizza, and we probably should wash them. That's relatively safe. These aren't that hot compared to like...they taste like a regular pepper, not so much a jalapeno. Yeah, I would put these closer to a green pepper instead of a jalapeno. Strange. Alright show us your harvest. -This is enough for a little snack. They are a little sunburnt. -So it's been about 3 months since we planted this thing, and we're starting to realize we made a pretty big mistake with the pumpkins. Apparently they expand quite a bit. And if you look back here they are even crawling up our fence through the trees into our neighbor's yard. So I hope our neighbor doesn't mind getting a few pumpkins of his own this year. Now supposedly, to get the most out of the pumpkins we're supposed to stop these little nubs from growing so that the plant isn't dedicating its energy to them. That way it can make these ones grow bigger, like that guy back there. Now it doesn't have to focus on the little guy and the big guy gets bigger. But once again we have no idea what we're doing. This is our first time, so hopefully we end up with some big pumpkins at the end of the year. -Alright, so we've been neglecting our garden a little bit, but just because the access was hard to get to because we've been building this barn. So anyway, we've regained access, but we have a crazy amount of weeds here that I haven't been able to come and pick. And then we've got our watermelons actually growing. We've got one down here looking good last time I saw it, and it shriveled. We still have watered it every day. I just haven't been able to check on all of it. -That's a good size watermelon. So yeah, I put Cambry in charge of designing the new barn. -Bigger means better. -I think with the potatoes the ground kind of settled a little bit. So you can see the potatoes poking out above the top of the dirt. So really just need to add some more dirt on top of that to keep the potatoes buried. -Alright, this part of the garden is kind of embarrassing. It is our lettuce. We used it to its potential. It's only supposed to be good for like a month I think. We would just come in and grab a leaf off and then, you know, put it in a hamburger or something like that. But once they start looking like this... -They are bitter and gross. It's the end of their season. So we really need to rip them all out and plant some more for fall harvest. Yeah. -She gone. -Ah there's a spider! -Zucchinis are here, and I like it in zucchini bread. But we've got this little guy here and then this guy back there and he's just right to pick. So when you pick it you don't want to pull it straight out, you just want to rotate it so that the base breaks off. Nice. We going to turn this one into bread? -Yeah. I also like making the zucchini boats. But this one will probably be bread. -Perfect. Do you have enough zucchinis? One interesting thing about this corn plant right here, you can see that it's kind of like bent and growing out of shape. It's because these pumpkins are growing through our corn now. And the pumpkin plant literally grabbed the corn stalk and bent it by the weight of the pumpkin plant and it's little viney things here. Wrapped it twice and now it's carrying it down. The corn plant is trying to compensate and then grow back upright again. Pretty interesting. There's a battle in the garden. Alright, it's time to harvest the corn. Cambry, how do we know when they're ripe? -Do it again, my finger was in the lens. -Cambry, how do we know when it's time to harvest the corn? -Okay, what I read off the internet... -It's gotta be true. -It's gotta be true...is once the hair or whatever it is, whenever you see those like white things that...yep. That stuff. When it comes out, it means 21 days from then the corn should be ready. So when it's brown it's a pretty good indication that it's ready to just open it up a little bit and then use your fingernail to like try and pop one of the kernels. And if like some of the liquid comes out then you know it's ready. -This actually looks really good. Check that out. Alright. Oh yep. Squirted right out. Okay, how many do we need? -I don't know, eight? -Alright. The harvest is here and we will cook them. -I hope there's no bugs. [Kid] There is, there is! By your hand! [Cambry] Cut that out? [Zack] Nope. [Cambry] I don't want people to know I'm a pansy! That's beautiful! I'm eating this one. [Zack] Look at that bug free. So on this week's episode of attack of the pumpkins, we have some pretty big pumpkins in here. I'll show you. We have this guy right here, as well as two more that are back there in this. But what I want to show you is these pumpkins here have actually taken this middle pine tree and bent it over. As well as this bay, the planter box and this bay, Cambry can't really utilize this space anymore. Moral of the story is don't plant so many pumpkins. We can see that the vines are actually growing up in between all of the corn. There's even a pumpkin growing midair right there, like, I don't know, seven feet off the ground. Then there's another one growing right here in the air, and there in the air. They're just using these corn stalks as kind of like their own little climbing fence. And we have some growing up and into the neighbor's yard. But there are still quite a few big ones going on up in there. They are also kind of overtaking our watermelons. But yeah, the barn's looking good. What do you think, Cambry? -I think we've learned a lot this year. -So tonight we're having a little tin foil dinner thing and we thought it would be nice if we got some of our own onions and carrots. So we're going to dig these carrots up for the first time. -Yeah. I've been waiting because I want them to get really big before we picked any, but I think we have some big ones here. There's this big one right here. It's one of them that came over by our onions. But you can kind of see the top of it. Like that's pretty big for a carrot. I'm excited. -Yes! -Hello there! -Nice. -Weird growing patterns or something. I don't know if a bug got it or something there. -Weird. -I don't know if it's the top or the bottom, but it smells good. -It smells like a carrot. -Right? -Nice. -Whoa, that one's perfect. -That's a great carrot. -Yes. -Nice. It's a weird one. -Right? It like spirals. Ready? Shake, shake, shake. -Baby carrots. -Those are some good size ones in there. Yeah yeah. -Alright so the potatoes are not from our garden, but the onions and the carrots are from our garden. So it is now the middle of September and our garden has kind of run its course. We have still zucchinis coming out. Cambry, how many zucchinis do you think we've gotten over the course of this garden experience. -At least 30, maybe 40. -Yeah. We definitely have had more success with zucchinis than anything else. But yeah, our garden is mostly phasing out. We still have a bunch of carrots and onions we can pick. We have a ton of pumpkins which you'll see more of in a minute. But today we're picking the peppers because we're going to have fajitas. Speaking of pumpkins, this freaking pumpking right here has gone all the way through the corn, through the asparagus, and is just making its way all the way to the end of the garden. We are definitely going to plant less pumpkins next year. -But it's been beneficial for our peppers because they were bleaching out with the sun, and since they've had the shade, like this one had four of them on and only one of them has bleached out. -Brussel sprouts are still kind of doing their own thing. But I think we have one more jalapeno being attacked by this pumpkin. See that grip right there? That's vicious. Jalapenos. This will be a good addition to the fajitas. -Wow. -You want to take a bite? [Laughter] -So picking a watermelon is actually really hard to know if it's ripe or not. So if you look on the underside, supposedly it's supposed to be yellow, but this one is still pretty white. Or pretty green actually. And then also, if we look right at the place where the watermelon joins with the stem, there's like a little vine thingy, as well as one leaf. And both of those have to be dead. Supposedly. I'm not an expert. But this one is our closest where it's still like super white on the bottom. So we're going to give it a shot. And both the little vine thing is dead as well as the leaf is dead. So we are going to just pop this off and give it a shot. And if this one's good, then we'll do the big one later. But yeah, it also sounds kind of hollow inside, which we hope is also an indicator of ripeness. -Can't believe this is the smallest. -Sometimes the smallest is the best. -It's the size of my head. -Still not okay. If you avoid the seeds it's alright. It's actually not bad. So the day has finally arrived. This is our final update for the garden. A lot has changed in the last year. How many months have we been doing this Cambry? -I think we started around Mother's Day. May? -And things look a lot different than they did back then. What's been your favorite part? Wow, there's been so many good parts. But my favorite thing that grew would probably be the carrots. I just love the carrots. This is just a small portion, but I'm really excited about that. And my favorite thing to eat from our garden was the corn. I thought that tasted amazing. -The corn was really good. My favorite thing was definitely the pumpkins even though they kind of like took over the entire thing, every single finger. It's the first day of October and it's officially fall now, so we're going to harvest everything that's left and then we'll tell you what we're going to do differently next year. This guy grew on the edge of the wooden frame, so we're going to cut through this and see what kind of design is on the under side. Kind of strange. So this is the finger of our pumpkin patch and it is completely just taken over all of these pine trees. Like look at this tree right here. That's crazy. Let's see if we can bring him back up. Next year we are definitely cutting back on the pumpkins. Sorry little buddy. We will straighten this guy up later. So we are about to explore into the neighbor's yard. It looks like this is our garden. Cambry's back there. The pumpkins have gone over the fence, down into the neighbor's yard, and they have a pumpkin. It's alright, alright, alright. So we're just going to let the neighbors keep that pumpkin. I'm not going to go get it. And we'll just keep the ones on this side of the fence. These are the brussel sprouts which we are giving up on because there are no brussels in the sprouts. I think brussel sprouts are supposed to pop up in between these leaves, but the plants have had a long time and no brussels, so we're ripping them out. So if you remember, we built these gardens out of redwood, which means the redwood is supposed to last like 30 years before it like, you know, rots away. And everything looks like it's holding up pretty well. Nothing's like bowing out or out of position. All the fingers are still intact. We still need to put the pavers down here at the bottom so Cambry can wheel around easier. But yeah, even along this back line everything looks pretty darn good. We also got the new barn in position for Cambry's horses when she brings those over. So yeah, we've made some pretty big improvements this year. Plus, my giant sequoia trees are at least double in size now. For me, I think my favorite's the onions, for some reason were strangely amazing. And also the corn I felt like were really cool. Not to mention, not to mention the pumpkins. I think we got about 30 of them. Pumpkins are freaking awesome. They didn't grow as big as I wanted them to, but I think they were just too crowded down there at the end of the finger. Just too many plants, not enough space or nutrients to satisfy all of them. So when we thin them out next year, we should have bigger pumpkins and it should be a little better. This one is definitely the weirdest looking pumpkin of the bunch. We're going to leave the zucchini plants because they are still producing. It's rather amazing. It really is pretty amazing that we can get all of this food and all of this greenery, and all of this shrubbery from just tiny seeds and a lot of water. -And a lot of horse manure. -And good soil. So Cambry, now that we've finished harvesting, what are we going to do differently for next year? -Oh I've got a list of things, but the first thing being that the pumpkins get their own row. Like they aren't sharing it with anything else. They just have their own row. And then the watermelon can have their own row. -We planted so many pumpkins that it just took over everything. And so less pumpkin plants... -For sure, less pumpkin plants. More space for them. -And we can delegate where they grow. Like we can make sure the vines only go off of the one side instead of... -This year we just let them grow! -Yeah, and then Cambry couldn't even get down two of the fingers because they were full of vines. -And next year we're talking about maybe putting in like a little bit of a fence or like a trellis or something for them to grow up a little bit more rather than sprawling out. -Yeah, and trying to keep them out of our neighbor's yard. -Cuz we know they like climbing. Yeah, I think our peas, our sugar snap peas, and our sweet peppers, and our jalapenos I think we'll put near the shade a little bit more. They just got too much sun. Cucumbers were a total flop. They tasted terrible, there were too many of them. Just terrible. So I'm going to try a different variety and less plants next year. And the lettuce as well. We just like we're overgrown with lettuce and we're going to narrow it down to one row of lettuce. We just don't eat that much for the two of us. Next year I'm going to be way more aggressive with the bugs. I'm going to put dio tenacious earth down because that supposedly keeps a lot of them away from your plants. Then I'm also going to spray with neem oil because it's safe for bumblebees, and I'm really happy with how many bumblebees we got this year so I want to keep those guys safe by just spraying neem oil on the plants. -So overall I would say that this year's garden was a major success. But with what we know now, next year's garden will be even more successful. As well as the major improvements we're going to make with the pavers, as well as the watering system which I can't tell you about yet. I'm going to save that for another video. -Yeah, if you guys have any suggestions as to what we should grow next year, we'd love to hear it. And if you have any gardening tips, put them in the comments. -Thanks a ton for watching. We'll see you around.",

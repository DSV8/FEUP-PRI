To learn more about the ORIGIN PC CHRONOS and Intel's 12th-Generation processors, click here:    Origin is a big player in the pre-built market for high-performance gaming desktops, and they wanted us to check out their Chronos line, a small-for-factor system. We were worried since this one uses an i9-12900k and a 3080 Ti with a 750W PSU, so we needed to see if it could survive if we pushed its limits.

    "transcript": "- ORIGIN PC sent over a crate, a supply crate, if you will. Uh. Yeah, there we go. (box thuds) Video games are a lie. I mean maybe I'm just not hitting it at the right angles or something. It should just be like flying apart and I should get, I don't know, energy cells or... - [Jono] Ammo. - Ammo. Med kit. (wood clatters to floor) How do I get this out now? Do I have to tip it, I guess? This packaging, though. (Anthony grunts) Get out. Wow, that's a tight fit. This is the Chronos 2020, according to this. All right. Let's dig deeper. Thank you for choosing ORIGIN PC. Well, ORIGIN PC, you chose us today. So thank you. Get a nice mouse pad, as usual. Ours is bigger. Oh, yeah. So this is the stuff out of the power supply, and probably also the motherboard box. Got ZOTAC gaming stuff in there. This is the main event. Time to get this thing outta the package. What is this? This is weird. It's got like, it's like it's got underwear. It's stretchy and stuff. That's cool. You ever wanted clothing for your PC? We should do PC clothing. So this is the ORIGIN PC Chronos. Is there anything special, like what model number it is? Or is it just Chronos. - [Jono] It's just a customized system. - Okay, so the base model doesn't seem like it's that great a deal, but I don't think they expect you to buy the base model anyway. This is all about customization. So if you wanna bump up the spec on one thing or another, then you can. The base price is just kind of the base of what you can get. I just hit the BIOS clear button. That's great. (Anthony chuckles nervously) So I'm looking at this and I don't see a way in without taking screws out. So I'm gonna start taking screws out. Ah, there we go. That just pops right off like that. That is a dual 120-millimeter rad, so a 240, I think that is. And in order to get underneath that, I'm gonna have to take these screws out. (drill whirs) That's interesting. This is a really compact little build. Oh, that power supply is tiny. That's a 750 watt? What GPU is this? - [Jono] A 3080ti. - What CPU is this? 12900K. (Anthony sighs) Okay. So I don't know how much people watch \"LTT\" and \"Short Circuit\", but the 12900K is a CPU that can draw up 260 watts-plus on its own, especially considering, as a K-series SKU, it has no turbo limit, so it'll just keep going for as long as it needs to. The 3080ti, I think it'll do like 300-ish, 400 watts all day long. But it can spike a lot, like instantaneous readings can go as high as 700-ish-plus watts. So I'm a little concerned about that, Jono. - [Jono] You can change it out. - Right, you can change it out, and that is fully supported by the warranty, which I think is a year. They tell us, though, that it's gonna work just fine. Yeah, the overall build quality is pretty good. For something so tiny, considering the fact that this is a commercial product and not something that somebody has put together for themselves, it's pretty tight. - [Jono] The 3080ti has a sustained max power of 350 watts. - 350 watts sustained, yeah. That's about what I figured. So we're gonna have to hit it with some pretty heavy loads and see if ORIGIN PC can be trusted or if you're gonna have to find some other small form factor power supply. It's actually gonna be a bit of an issue to find a power supply that is powerful enough to just do all of that, while also fitting in here. Got a nice fan filter on the bottom here, as well, easy to remove and clean. These meshes, these mesh panels, also going to be pretty easy to clean, and they will make it much easier for the system to breathe. It shouldn't be very loud. With that being said, I guess now is a good time to fire it up. Let's power it up. Uh-oh. Uh, there we go. You know, I know people don't like the look of mesh as much as they do tempered glass, but I kinda to like the look of mesh. I missed the BIOS. I was gonna go in, see if I wrecked it. But since I did not get a, \"The CMOS settings are gone,\" I'm going to go ahead and assume that I did not, in fact, wreck the BIOS settings. Ooh. Is this the default? So our idle temperatures, I mean we haven't really been running for very long, but looks like 21 degrees, 24 degrees, somewhere around there. Apparently the minimum temperature, at one point, was zero degrees, so that was a glitch. Oh, wait, no. A bunch of them are just dropping out and showing zero degrees from time to time. Just gonna burn this thing and see what happens. What's your bet on what's gonna happen, Jono? Do you think this thing's just gonna shut down? Do you think it's gonna throttle? - [Jono] I think it'll be just fine. - Think it'll be fine? You got confidence in ORIGIN PC? GPU stress tests, go. Prime95. - [Jono] Wait, you're doing both? - Oh, yeah. Okay the CPU package is at 90-ish degrees. Okay, 96, 97. Okay, it's not going any higher, yet. All right, so we're at 338 watts for the GPU, and the CPU, we're drawing 280-ish watts. We went up to as high as 301. So it's currently thermal throttling. That's why it's at around 280 and not 300. You can hear those fans ramping up. They should've ramped up much sooner, but probably what's going on is it didn't do that in order to make it so that you don't constantly hear, (imitates fans winding up and down) whenever you hit it with a short load. There's a lotta red. Yeah, the CPU has hit 100 degrees on several cores. To be clear, we're still boosting on both the CPU and the GPU. It's not like it's actually bad. A non-K SKU for the CPU would have throttled down to base clock at this point, which would have been around 3.7 gigahertz. We're still at 4.2, 4.3, whereas the maximum boost clock is five. So we're kinda in the middle of where we could be. So yeah, it would appear that that power supply is able to handle this, which is interesting. It's totally fine. I mean okay, it doesn't sound very fine, does it? CPU is currently thermal throttling all over the place. Now, of course, the system is screaming right now. So let's stop the GPU load and see if that, see how much of that noise was the GPU. I doubt it was much. Oh, yeah, the system itself is pretty hot, too. Oh, especially the rear side of the motherboard. That SSD's probably getting cooked back there. But the good thing about that, it's getting pretty good passive convection, and also there's a little bit of air flow coming from this upper fan, as well. So it's not bad. Also, a lot of that screaming was, in fact, the GPU. The CPU cooler is just a whoosh. If that were glass, oh-ho. Well, considering I feel a lot, a lot of air coming through here on the intake, this is take air in and it's getting exhausted out the top, and the back, yep, I think glass would probably be not advisable in this situation. You'd probably wanna go with a lower-end CPU. A Core i7 or a Core i5 might be perfectly fine in that case, but if you want a Core i9 like this, you'll probably wanna get the mesh sides. Anyway, let's stop this Prime95 and see what the gaming performance looks like. Okay, so I'm putting on Ultra Nightmare. Gonna turn ray tracing on, 'cause why not? All right, so sitting at the title screen, we've got about 120-ish fps. Vertical sync is off, so that is as fast as it can go. Oh, it's getting kinda loud. Low ammo and I think low health. No. Health's okay. It's a pretty good experience. Uh, yeah, so we're dipping under 100 here, but only barely. In most cases, it looks like you're gonna get about 120 fps at 4K with everything maxed out in \"Doom Eternal\". Now that's obviously not indicative of every game. \"Doom Eternal\" is basically the most optimized game I can think of. But with that being said, that's a lotta performance. It all just works. They didn't even send us this keyboard, either. This pattern is gonna go around, and now it's on the keyboard, and now it's back into the system. That's the cool thing about iCUE. I do wish that that were something as robust as iCUE that supported general RGB stuff, but if you're in the Corsair ecosystem... Honestly I'm kinda surprised that this thing was able to handle as much wattage going through it as it did. Not only just from the fact that it's a 750-watt power supply in there, but also because it's such a small package for this much going on, and it's not a customized cooling setup, like you'd get with an extreme small form factor build. This is straight-up just a compact ITX build. So the fact that the CPU thermal-throttled doesn't surprise me. The fact that it didn't thermal throttle a lot surprised me. I don't really think I have any major complaints. The warranty covers swapping out parts. Of course the parts that you swap in won't be covered by ORIGIN's warranty, but they'll be covered by the manufacturer's warranty then, and your warranty for the rest of the system is not voided. I don't know what else to say. Jono, this is, it's a computer. - [Jono] Is it a powerful computer? - It is a powerful computer. Very powerful for how compact it is. So if this looks like something that might interest you, or something similar, you can go ahead and build this specific one. This was like four grand.

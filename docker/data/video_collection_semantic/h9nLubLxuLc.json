    "transcript": "- [Michael Fisher] If you want in your next smartphone is something a little different well 2017 is gonna be a really good year for you. On the flagship side this year LG is leading the principal charge for an Android alternative to Samsung but it's discarded last years compromises and gimmicks for a return to the fundamentals a renewed focus on quality and a camera I'm dearly gonna miss when I have to move on. I'm Mr Mobile and the is the LG G6 review brought to you by Mint SIM. The G6 has the best hand feel of any LG phone I've used. The chromed-out plastic and strange paint jobs of previous models have been replaced by glass and aluminum construction that gleams like metal in the platinum version and gives the black trim a liquid allure that's gorgeous as long as you keep a chamois handy. Harkening back to 2012's Optimus G the G6 feels heavier than it actually is and LG's refusal to taper the edges makes it seem thicker too. This is a welcome change of pace. The result is a phone that's easy to hold and reassuringly tank-like. And backing up that hand feel is IP68 dust and water-resistance as well as protection against temperature extremes and mechanical shock. None of this is to say that you should go around smacking your phone into parking lot puddles and the Gorilla Glass 5 backplate does indeed gets scratched in such situations. But it should handle abuse better than its immediate predecessor. Of course if you want a real beast there's the all-metal V20 but the G Series is made to appeal to a broader audience. And the G6 does a great job of feeling both accessible and exceptional. That also applies to the screen. It's 5.7 inches but well so is this one. I'll give you one guess as to which is easier to use one-handed. The 2:1 aspect ratio means you can symmetrically stack two apps at a time. Or watch fancy new shows in the hip 18:9 format. At press time Netflix and Google Play movies each allow true full-screen scaling on the G6 but YouTube does not. So you're still gonna get letterboxing or pillarboxing with some videos. For me the more exciting bit is the ergonomic win. Because of the stretched screen the phone can display more while staying easy to use. And LG has a couple of nice software tricks to make that one-handed use even easier. The screen is HDR-ready and when it's not being used you have an option of a persistent clock or signature and notifications will show up here too. That said, if you use that ambient display the backlight will be working at least a little bit all the time. That might account for the some of the meddling battery life I've seen from our G6. I can usually make through the day but sometimes it's a stretch unless I periodically top it up. Oh hey look! Wireless charging is back. Hurray! The early software I'm using could be responsible for some of that power drain too. This is Android 7.0. When the G6 comes to the US it'll offer 7.1 and no doubt some polishing of the LG UI. But even in its current state it's less obtrusive and more responsive than any LG skin that's come before. I installed Nova Launcher after a week just to spiff up the look and feel. And the G6 runs it well despite the spec sheet some are calling disappointing. We'll come to that in a second though because first, I really I just have to show you the cameras. If you follow @theMrMobile on Instagram or Facebook you already know how enamored I am of this array which uses one camera for standard pics and one for wide-angle shots. What does this mean for you? No more backing up to get everyone in the frame. And no more holding your phone above your head to cram in all your lunch. For all these photo pairs you're seeing I took both pictures from the same exact position. Often I'll shoot with the wide lens even when I don't need it just for that added dramatic effect. Now there are disadvantages to going wide all the time as with most of these lenses you get a pronounced fisheye effect that distorts the edges. Also there's no optical stabilization on the wide side as there is with the standard lens and the aperture is smaller as well which means it's not as good for night shots. And the front-facing camera gets so grainy and dim settings has to be pretty distracting. But low-light is still a challenge for most smartphones. Anyone remember my first nighttime walkabout with the Pixel? And really, it's all a balancing act isn't it? The question is does the G6 camera bring enough capability to forgive its shortcomings? And the answer for me is an unqualified yes. Of all the things I'll miss when I move on from the G6 the camera tops the list. For all that the G6 gets right it doesn't check all the boxes for some power users. For them a 2016 processor in a 2017 flagship is anathema. Well two generation old Gorilla Glass on the front and a lackluster single-edge speaker scream cost-cutting. Adding insult to injury this is the first G Series flagship since 2013 with a non-removable battery. And while phone calls are handled with LG's usual aplomb audiophiles will be unhappy to learn that the Premium DAC shipping in overseas models won't come to US shores. Whether these shortcomings are worth dwelling on will depend on your priorities. And of course, what the US pricing turns out to be. No word from that yet from LG. But even if that price scrapes the stratosphere the G6 has a lot going for it. During my two weeks with I never thought; Boy I wish I had a Snapdragon 835. Because the 821 is more than capable of handling anything I can imagine wanting to run on my phone for the next year. I also never said I wish this camera was better because it does stuff no other smartphone camera can do. About the only thing that gives me pause is the software situation. LG is not so great with keeping up with Android updates but then again you can say the same with many manufacturers. So for me the G6 hits a lot more than it misses. I'm comfortable recommending it to anyone looking for a compelling alternative to Samsung at the high-end or a smartphone camera unlike any other.

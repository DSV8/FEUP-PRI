    "transcript": "- How long has it been since you cleaned out your tower, or your keyboard, or your controllers? I mean, no judgment here. There's dust in this keyboard that's probably older than my kids, but I say enough is enough! So today, I need three things, this bin of random cleaning supplies from Amazon, and AliExpress, (supplies spilling) a helpful assistant, - Hey. - Hi, Luke, and a costume change to set the mood. (sparkles twinkling) (rock music) (Linus exhaling) - Oh, beautiful, perfect, yeah, definitely. Oh, amazing. - Don't worry, I got it. - Oh, the fishnets, okay. - We got an outfit for you, too. - Oh great. (groaning) - This is gonna be fun! (Luke giggling) Fun, just like this message from our sponsor. - Build Redux, with simple to navigate customization options, and competitive pricing compared to building a PC yourself, Build Redux will help you dominate your favorite games with the perfect PC for you, and not another different person, they can get their own. Check them out at the link below. - First up, you're gonna need one of these. Yep, just turn around. I can do you up from the back, it's not weird, and then you've got two options for gloves. - Okay? - This or this. - Oh my. - And if your keyboard is anything to go by, - Probably these? (table thumping) - I'm voting for these. - These are funnier, so I think I'm just gonna send it. - We'll be working on a combination of people's work keyboards, and laptops, and monitors, and some that people brought from home, some of which are markedly more disgusting. This is actually gross. - And it spent three years incubating in my car, growing, festering. (screen beeping) - We're gonna start with a fairly easy challenge. This is my keyboard. (keyboard clattering) Gross, but less gross. Now, we're gonna play Cleaning Supplies Roulette. We're each gonna pick something, not really knowing what any of this is, and take half the keyboard, and attempt to clean it. (eyes whooshing) (upbeat music) - I go first? (supplies rattling) I don't, I don't know what that was. I think I'm just gonna go basic with the wipes. - Okay, you've got the miracle wipes. That, I happen to know already, cost us 10 bucks on Amazon, and what did the ColorCoral cost us? This looks like so much fun. Oh, ew. - What the? - Things are about to get funky. - Oh, it's one of those! (Linus squealing) That might actually- (Linus sniffing) - That does not smell very good. (ColorCoral stretching) - It looks like it came off of my keyboard. (giggling) - You ready? 3, 2, 1, - Hard to do with gloves, - Go. - But, okay. (keyboard thumping) (keys rattling) (upbeat music) - Okay, the idea is you just mush this in between the keys, and it just kind of lifts everything away. Holy crap! I've never used this stuff before, but I am actually kind of impressed. - That looks very easy to use. It also looks like it's getting between the keys really nicely, - Yeah! - And this thing is not, at all. - Ew! (Linus and Luke groaning) Hey, you're hacking, you're cleaning during B-roll. (Luke laughing) - I gotta get any advantage I can, man, I got the big gloves. - That is such a cheat, you don't- - [David] You don't want gloves? - It doesn't get that, no, this is my keyboard. Realistically... (Luke chuckling) I mean, I'm gonna put on gloves for- - You'll want gloves for mine, yeah. (laughing) What do you do once this is gross, you just throw it out? You need it, no? - No way you could wash it. \"Make sure your hands are dry and clean, \"take a piece of the cleaning gel...\" (Luke scoffing) Oh, I see. - [Jordan] You can reuse it until it's gray and doesn't pick up anything anymore. - Okay. It's not perfect. If it's really caked on, it's not gonna grab it, but there's no doubt that my side of the keyboard looks better than yours, right? - Yeah, I feel like these might actually do better on my keyboard, 'cause there's more actual, like, stuff to scrape off. - Well, we're gonna find out soon enough. - Yeah. - Why don't we move on to your keyboard, - Okay. - And I think the way this is gonna work is we're allowed to use anything in our arsenal, but we can pick a new tool every time. - You know what's cute? In a way, you're on my keyboard, and I'm on your keyboard. - [Linus] Yeah, I know. - Aw. - Keyboard buddies. Okay, hey, you're looking at all the stuff! - I'm trying to get any advantage I can. - Freaking hacker, okay, you pick first this time. - You won the first round. (product thumping) - You know what? - An air duster? - I feel like this is gonna come in handy for later. - Oh, okay, strategic. (air duster thumping) - Yeah, I don't think it's (pieces clattering) gonna do much for me on this, this is caked. How much did we pay for the OXO Good Grips Keyboard and Screen Deep Cleaning Set? - $20? - 20 bucks? - For what? (Luke groaning) A pipe cleaner on a little plastic holder, a little stiff bristle brush, and what the crap is this? A microfiber cloth that doesn't come out of the bag, so you can stuff it back in the bag? - You can reuse it, I guess? - I guess so. Yeah, well, I bet (box opening) my air duster, based on the packaging... - (laughing) I can't put this back in with these gloves. - Probably doesn't even cost more than that. I'm saying it's 30 bucks. $40, but look at it go. It's like a ray-gun. (imitating ray-gun) And, no way, get this. (box thumping) I get a stiff bristle brush, a soft bristle brush, - [Luke] Oh my goodness. - [Linus] Another stiff bristle brush. - [Luke] This is gonna be really good. - Another brush, an airflow focusing hose, a other more different one, a more different one, a fourth different one. - I'm concerned now. - A handy-dandy little bag. - Oh, like a carrying bag? - And a charging cable. (plastic crinkling) - So, what is it, why does it need to charge? - [Linus] I think it's battery operated. - [Luke] Is it just like, hair dryer amount of air? - \"Pls use A-C cable to charge, no C-C cable.\" With this, I can brush all subtleties away. - [Luke] I like difficult assistant. (chuckling) - We can stop here. (fan blowing) (Luke laughing) That's more, that's a lot more than I expected. - Let me clean you. - (laughing) Oh no, don't clean that. (fan accelerating) - Whoa! - What? Do that full blast on my face. - She bangs. (everyone laughing) (Luke shutting down) What is sticking in my ear? - Oh no. - The headband, obviously. (fan blowing) - I legitimately didn't mean it that way. Is that full blast? Yeah, that's pretty crazy, actually. - Wow. - I don't think that's gonna do much for you here- - And I didn't even realize... - Ah, you can focus it. - But there's a brush, this one is a brush and... Ew! Oh, look at all the stuff coming out of it. - [David] New rule, you can't blow it towards me. (Luke laughing) - Without lube, man, you ain't getting this off. - Oh my god. - This is not doing anything. - This is doing something, but it's very- - Okay, I need a stiffer brush. (keys rattling) Yeah, you know what, I think I'm gonna need it too. I'm so sorry for what I'm about to do to you. (ColorCoral squishing) (upbeat music) Whoa, not bad, brother. I really wish I had wet wipes right now. - Just for science, do you want to use some? - My blower is doing absolutely nothing, nope, nope, nope, I don't want. - No science here. - No, if you've got something really crusty, there is just no substitute for wet wipes. - And you should probably like, take them off, and put them in a bag, and put them in a dishwasher. - And you should probably just never allow it to get to this point. (David laughing) You just got shamed. - Hey, if I was actually asked, and I brought my keyboard from home, it wouldn't have been that bad, because my keyword from home is all right. - Okay, so what you're saying is you treat things nicely as long as they're not things I gave you? - (chuckling) No, what I'm saying is this- - Or rather, that you stole. - This grew in a car for three years. (chuckling) - It wasn't that much better before he put it in the car - That's true, it didn't have the like, green color, though. (chuckling) - I'm able to get a little bit off the keys now. (bristles brushing) - Is that the toothbrush one? I think the toothbrush one's gonna be really good. - You think so? This one goes right in between the key caps. (bristles brushing) I think you're trying to throw me off. - No. - It's the kind of thing you would do, Luke. - It might be. - Oh wow, I'm really kicking (fan blowing) some stuff outta here now. - Hey, get outta here, hey, hey, hey, hey! - Why do I have my mouth open? That's a really bad idea. (crew laughing) I'm ready for judging. Who's gonna be our judge? (crickets chirping) (keys rattling) Vance, you volunteer as tribute. Which side would you eat off of? - What, do I have to answer a side? (Luke laughing) (upbeat music) - Pencils down. - I would take Luke's side. - Oh. - These arrow keys are still disgusting, and that Shift key is still gross. - If I'm being completely honest, his side started way worse. His side was, by far, the grosser side. (chuckling) - I don't have a Most Improved award, but I would eat off of that side. - All right, all right, all right. - Yeah, you can really see that Luke's wet wipes (keyboard thumping) are great for dealing with the tops of the keycaps, but as soon as you get around to the sides, they fall apart significantly, whereas if you look deep into the board, the plate is way cleaner on my side, because Luke had no way of removing detritus - Yeah, some of the keycap sides, - That fell between. - If I spent enough time on it, I could get them okay, but it was, honestly, it took a lot of time, 'cause these little scrubby things are trash. The wet wipes really did most of the work here. - Check this out. (fan blowing) (ColorCoral flapping) (David laughing) It makes fart noises. All right, what's our next challenge? - Oh my god. - Why don't we do a screen? - Okay. - Am I allowed to scavenge weapons from him? - No. (hand punching) (wipe whooshing) Just take it. Do I get to pick first this time? - I think that's fair. - Amazon Basics something. I'm guessing you're not going for OXO brand again? - Yeah, that was very unimpressive. I think I'm gonna take this. 24 wipes, oh, it's just 24 identical wipes? - Nice. - Well, I already picked it. (David laughing) - And... And what do I get? Oh, a cleaning kit for DSLR cameras. - Oh. - I think if I get a spray bottle, I should be allowed to put something in it. - [David] Water. - Water, all right. Ooh. - Is that one of those brush things? - A lens cleaning pen, that's- - Probably not gonna do enough for any. - Wow, a lot less effective than the other thing I have. I hope I didn't pay too much for this. \"Lens tissues, lint free for...\" Oh, okay. - This'll be good for stuff. - [Linus] Yeah, a little makeup brush. - I don't know if that'll be better than this. - This, you don't wanna just use for everything though. - No. - 'Cause that'll like, bung it up. - Yep. - And then, oh yeah, there's the other like, cleaning side. - That's for detailing. - This is key though. (bottle spraying) (upbeat music) Now, I'm loaded for bear. What's this worth? Hopefully not more than about 14.99, 10 bucks. - [Luke] Okay, that's actually not too bad. - All right, all right, thanks, Amazon Basics. - Oh, they're each in like, individual packages. (box thumping) - Okay. - Oh, I think they're just like, alcohol wipes. - Okay. - So I could destroy your monitor if you want. - I prefer if you didn't. You can't use any of your wipes on the monitor. Linus chooses right again! - It shows a monitor on the box, I wonder if they did something stupid or no? They can't get away with like, \"Oh, we just meant for you to clean the bezel.\" They specifically show the motion of how to clean on the screen. - [Linus] That's really dumb. - So like, you actually shouldn't sell this. - But it's got aerospace certifications. (Luke snorting) (David laughing) - And it's made in the USA with help from outside. - \"iCloth is a registered\" - There at the bottom. - \"Trademark of Devonshire Limited, Montreal, Canada.\" Are they Canadian, American? - And all of those combined, working together, can destroy your screen. Honestly, this is super annoying, because of all this stuff being on this thing, (Linus chuckling) trying to wipe something down, I have all these plastic things dangling with me all the time. - Uh huh? - That's like not good. - Do you want to cry a little bit more? I just, I find that to be a really attractive quality - I'm trying explain the qualities- - In a man. - I'm gonna steal some of your water. I'm trying to explain the quality- - No, gimme my water back! (Luke grunting) Gimme my water back! Oh man, I'm going deluxe on this cleaning treatment. - I'm not going on the screen. I have no interest in damaging things without cause. - This goo was a good choice. - [Luke] Did you know it was goo? - I have heard of goo before, - Cheater. - And it looked kind of like it could be goo, but I didn't know - Pre-existing knowledge. - We bought goo, well, whatever, cry more. Whoa, awesome. - Oh, dude. - OP. Watch this, boom, goo. (imitating goo squishing) (calm music) - [Luke] Oh, he's cleaning my side too, let's go! - Check this out, the goo is kind of awesome for this, too. Not bad, it doesn't go all the way in, and it does a surprisingly good job of picking itself back up though. I was really worried that you'd kind of- - It's gonna leave material behind? - Yeah, put goo in, and then it would be left. You know what, though? I don't think the goo is actually as good as a fine brush for certain things. I'm gonna give this just (bottle spraying) a light misting here, and get in here with a brush, (bristles brushing) and what I suspect is I'm actually gonna be able to do a better job of this vent. Oh I have the, oh right, I have the duster. (sad music) And then there's sad Luke who is sad. - I grabbed the box that showed cleaning a screen, because I thought they would be like, or screen cleaning wipes, not specifically things that are bad. - You know what? - So I have two of the same product in different forms. (chuckling) - The goo is cool, but you can see it didn't actually do as good of a job as a light misting, a brush, and then wiping up with a microfiber cloth. I would like to, I know this, we're over on Luke's side now, but I would like to take a crack at it with this, (attachment popping) 'cause I suspect this is going to clean up, pun intended. - Mm hmm, mm hmm. (fan blowing) (sad music) - Yeah, for anything that's not caked on, like Luke's keyboard, that is awesome. That looks like new. So anything like a little vent on here across the top, this is gonna do (fan blowing) a bang up job. So shiny, so new, and then there's Luke's side. Good attempt, Luke. - Your side isn't perfect. I'm actually kind of surprised by that. Mine's way worse. - [Linus] I could have used a rougher cloth, actually. - [Luke] This, yeah, this cloth is terrible. - [Linus] Yeah, this cloth is too fine. - [Jordan] I'm sorry, I just remembered. - Yeah, but we don't have that product. - This came with that. - Oh, that came with that? - Pissed! - I mean, yeah, that would've helped. - I've been scizzamed. Wow, that's way better in every way. (chuckling) - Yeah, you want a textured microfiber cloth for stuff like this. Next challenge, laptop. (laptop thumping) Now, this is a situation where my duster might not actually be my best bet. - Oh, I think it'll be pretty good, 'cause like the fan in there? - Oh, maybe, maybe. - It'll have uses. I don't know if you'd want to use it for the whole thing. - But I wouldn't want to blow crap - No. - Back into the computer. - [Luke] I have no idea what this is, and there's no label, - It's- - So I think I'm just gonna YOLO that. Going for the fun factor. - I'm going for the strategic factor of making sure Luke never gets anything that can spray water. - Aw. (Luke scoffing) - Even though I already have one. (Luke laughing) No, no, I won't. I actually wanna see this thing. - What the heck is this? - [Jordan] For Luke, that is a desktop vacuum cleaner. - It's a, this is a vacuum? - [Jordan] That's $4 on AliExpress. - $4, I... (vacuum whirring) (bright music) - There is no... That's not picking up anything. That vibrates more than it... - So you're saying, it sucks and it's lots of fun? - Mm. - [Linus] Hello, yeah, see it's moving it. Okay, but can it suck it up? - Oh! - It's picking stuff up. - I still think it's useless. - Hold on, hold on. This might be... (vacuum popping) Useless, you say? Put out your hand, I'll show you useless. - For $4? - Yeah, I mean, I'm not saying it's amazing. - For $4 just to do (vacuum snapping) some desk maintenance? - Yeah, I mean... - I mean it's more clutter on your desk. - A cloth, a cloth is probably a better plan. - Yeah. - You have chosen unwisely. - I'm trying to choose for (vacuum whirring) the fun, man, come on. - Did it come with this? - Yes. - No, choose to win. (product thumping) You gotta win. I don't know what we're (box opening) competing for, but, (Luke snorting) definitely bragging rights, okay. What is this? This is apparently a seven-in-one cleaner. Let's see if, without instructions, which is good, because it doesn't come with any, we can figure out what all seven cleaning functions are? Soft bristle brush, actually not bad. (Luke snorting) (brush rattling) You need to shave. - Or use one of those brushes. - Keycap puller? - Key puller. That's surprising to be in there, but okay. - Tampon. (text bouncing) oh, we've got a little rubber pick. - That might actually be real useful. - A little brush that is (Luke clearing throat) so close to this that I- - Does that count as one? Is that one of the tools? - I, this is, I bet they think this is two. - That's unfortunate. - [Linus] Hey, I got another spray bottle. - Oh my god. - [Linus] It's glass. - And I think this is probably also one. - [Linus] That, oh, like oh, like a lint... - [Luke] Yeah. - A lint brush. (brush dragging) You know what, I'm gonna use only this for the laptop. (cleaner rattling) - How much was that one? - [Jordan] Oh, that was $12. - [Linus] 12 Bucks. - So you can get three of these. - Nope, I think I'll (David laughing) have this. (chuckling) (sad music) (cleaner rattling) (dramatic music) - Wow, it's an enthusiastic, little tool. - It's not the first time I've been called that. Oh shoot, did I just say I was gonna use only this? (vacuum dying) - [David] Yep. What was that sound? - Did you break it? - It's broken. (David laughing) - [Jordan] Take off the top and see if it's- - It might be fixable, but like- - [Jordan] Knocked the battery out. (percussive music) (vacuum thumping) (hands thumping) - Cool, well, (vacuum tumbling) I'm getting started. (cleaner rattling) - It's literally just broken. - It had problems with like the rechargeable batteries, so maybe the voltage dropped too much already? Which is pretty sad, 'cause it's been used- - No, it made like a grinding noise. - Yeah. - I turned it on, and it went. (imitating vacuum dying) - All right, let's go, clean laptop. (sad music) (David laughing) Did anyone get a screwdriver (cloth rubbing) as part of any of their cleaning supplies? - Nope, that would've been pretty OP. LTT screwdriver on lttstore.com. You can also buy water bottles, (graphics punching) which could hold liquid, which is a very big benefit in this challenge. (cleaner rattling) - Thanks for that. Ooh, that's a really fine mist, I like that. (bottle spraying) I don't have a cloth, okay, (cloth rubbing) I lied, I'm gonna have a cloth. - Well, now, he's cheating. - No, mine didn't have a cloth. That's not fair. - Yeah, but you're cheating. - That's not fair. - Imagine getting a seven-tool kit without a cloth. Imagine buying a $4 vacuum and it works precisely two times. (David laughing) Oh! - Oh, he fixed it. - I mean, it's useless now. - Wait, it takes AA batteries? (Jordan chuckling) Those batteries are worth like 10 times more than that vacuum. - It didn't come with them. - Yeah, I'm sure it didn't. - Wow, it's a little bit extra. (laughing) get, I've got a mask on, I don't wanna get you sick. - Really, really? (vacuum whirring) Whoa, really? That is actually working. (David chuckling) This is my side that hasn't been cleaned. Here's Luke's side. - Actually, yeah. - That legitimately did a pretty okay job. - I mean, it... - I mean- - It doesn't get into anything. - Yeah, anything would've. - Yeah. - Like here's my little brush from this thing. (bristles brushing) Looks just as good, but... - It did technically do a job. - Yes, it was not as useless as you made it sound. You were officially mean to it. You know what, I've got all these different like, cleaning schmoo, and fancy vacuums, and all this stuff. - Quit cleaning my side. - But I just keep coming back to good, old fashioned - Cleaning schmoo. (keys rattling) - A microfiber cloth with some water on it. - Ah. Yes, that's effectively what I'm doing. - Like this probably does a ever so slightly better job getting into those cracks. - But does it really do much when it's there? It does a little bit. - It does a little bit, I mean, you can tell, because it's more green than yellow now. Okay, screen time. Yeah, without my cloth, (vacuum whirring) I think I'm gonna struggle a little, oh wait. - I don't wanna scratch it, so I'm not actually really touching it. - Can I use this? (Luke and Linus gasping) whoa! - Whoa! - Not the best thing ever, but maybe it's intended for this? I think it's time for our judge. This is my side, this is Luke's side. - This one, I think you gotta get some angles on it, 'cause like, there's a lot of reflections going on. - The keyboard is pretty good for both of you. This side's a little gnarly still. Luke wins this round. (Luke grunting) - Okay, all right, thank you very much. - $4 vacuum. (laptop shutting) - I always intended to be trailing at the end. Why don't we have a clear idea of what they are this time? Our last items are a screen cleaner that kind of has this all over it, but it's just a spray bottle. (plastic crinkling) (jaunty music) This stupid thing. - [Jordan] That would be a five-in-one kit. - The OXO other more different crappy brush for probably 20 bucks again, microfiber cloths, (cloths thumping) and the mystery bag. - Who gets to go first? - I lost, so I get to go first. - Well, I'm screwed, because I know exactly- - Maybe you should pick two? - Really, you know exactly what to go for? - No, not at all. I definitely wouldn't pick that. That's the last thing I would pick. I don't know why you would pick that, 'cause it's not, it's strategic in any way. Restricting me from having that has no value in the- - I'm taking the mystery bag, what are you going for? (box thumping) You want the spray bottle? Yeah, okay, all right. - But are we getting rid of these or should we draft them? - How much are these? (plastic crinkling) - Or we draft, yes, so do you get to pick again? - Oh, do we get to go again? - [David] I think so. - Okay, then I want the five-in-one. - I'm gonna, I'm gonna just... I've already made this mistake once, I'll make it twice. I'll go with OXO. (everyone chuckling) - And I will take the bulk pack of microfiber cloths. (cloths thumping) - Wait, wait, wait, but, but... Because you're losing, you get three? (plastic crinkling) - You can have half of them. - Yeah, split them, - Okay, sure. - That's fair - There. Now, you can never say I'm not a good sport. - Everyone... (chuckling) Everyone has microfiber cloths. - Today. (Luke laughing) - Okay, so... - No okay, so. - All right, os. (David laughing) So it came with another more different, probably bad microfiber cloth. - Looks all right. - A classic picking tool - Kinda suede style one. - That might be all right, if stuff is actually really - Ooh. - Stuck in there, especially the curved edge. That's kind of nice. - Okay. - A solution of unknown. - Did you get alcohol again? - Are you serious? - No, deionized water and surfactant. - What's that? - \"Anti-schmutz.\" (Luke snorting) (David laughing) - [Jordan] That'll set you back a whopping 40 cents on AliExpress. - This is 40 cents? - Wait, what? - [Linus] Wow, this might be the best bang for the buck cleaning thing we've seen yet. - [Luke] Feel this, that's probably all right. - That is, I think that's that same stuff. - Yeah. - Yeah, so you just kind of like rub this on stuff? (Linus screaming) - Oh! (Luke chuckling) - Well, what's the point - I didn't think it would've been full, - Of this one? - Because of this. - Is that a recharge? - It comes with a refill. Whoa, and you just screw it in. - Oh. - 40 cents? - That's crazy for 40 cents. - That's cool. Okay, oh, you like your little pick, hey? - It's all right. - Oh. - It's okay. - Nice, little pick. - Hey, don't make fun of my pick, bro. - Not that I'm trying to compensate for anything, but... (Luke laughing) - Whoa! - I got a spatula. Wow, it's stiff. - Depending on what you're cleaning, that could be pretty good. - I mean, yeah, if you need to kind of get in there and... - Maybe. - I don't know. - That end, the other end might be more useful. - What the hell? There's so much stuff in here. (product tumbling) - Wow. - Oh no. - I got tweezers. - Tweezers? - These look like exactly the iFixit ones. Not quite, but they're definitely tweezers. - A little jankier. - [David] I have one of those. - What, do you, what is this? - What is that for? Like excavating tiny sand lots? - [David] It's like a... (upbeat music) - Wait, you own one of these? Shut up. - Yeah. (laughing) - Do you use it? - Why? - No, it was free with something that I got. (David laughing) - It came out again. - This really does feel like someone else went shopping on AliExpress, found a bunch of random crap, put it in a bag, and then put it up for sale on AliExpress, and- - [Jordan] Yes, but it's only 12 bucks. - It's $12, and it includes all these microfiber cloths. - Dude, but 40 cents. - Well, yeah, you win, clearly. - Yeah, but do you have this? - Well, I don't know if I win the game, but I win the... - 'Cause this could be lots of fun. - That could be pretty good. - What, how much did the OXO Sweep & Swipe Laptop Cleaner cost us, $18? Okay, well, let's see it. (Linus tickling) - That's super soft. - Yeah, okay. - Which means it's probably not very useful. - No, that doesn't mean it's not useful. - What's it gonna be useful for? - Mine's softer. (tickling) Maybe not. - Did you use that one once? - This, yes. - Yeah. - I used it on the monitor. Also, I have a super soft brush, too. - That's the microfiber pad. - A microfiber pad? - Oh, this might actually be all right. That might actually be all right. - Oh, so you can really like scrub? - Yeah. - But do you have any way of getting fresh - It's not gonna- - Microfiber on it? Nope, that's it, that's it forever. - That's a lot of plastic. (pad thumping) - Okay, (plastic crinkling) And I get this, a keycap puller. - So what are the five tools, do you unscrew it? - Oh, oh, oh, oh. - Oh. - Is that a, what the... Is that a pen? - So one, two, three, four. - That's four. (handle popping) - Yeah, what's that though? - [Jordan] Take apart the handle. Think that comes out, doesn't it? - Yeah. - Oh! Another tampon. (text buzzing) $10? - [Luke] Oof, that might be one of the worst. - Yikes. Ah, I have OXO products. - These are disgusting. Can we shame whoever these belong to? - [David] Me. - David, what the ****? - Are these both yours? (David laughing) - [David] No, the Xbox is mine, I got it like that, though. - I'll take the Xbox. - You want the Xbox? I want the Xbox. - Nah, you told me to choose, I'm choosing the Xbox. (text buzzing) (Luke snorting) - Ew. I can't tell if this is worn away, - You know what's gonna be really good at this, - Or writhing? - Is your picking tools. - Oh, good. - 'Cause getting around those keys, yeah. - Oh, good, thanks. - It's gonna be like cleaning someone's teeth. - See, I could use little picks, but I think instead I'm just gonna go straight for the strong bristle brush. - Just attack it? Yeah, yeah, oh, (bristles brushing) you're going, okay. - Okay. (bottle spraying) You wanna get as much of it off while it's dry as you can before you... (bell ringing) Oh, really? (crew chuckling) I mean, yeah, sure, everyone's got their strats, right? - I am speed. I don't care about two-stage processes, bruh, I'm cleaning stuff. There's no way I don't win Most Improved. The volume of material- - No, it poked up in my face! - The volume. (David laughing) Look at the cloth already. The winner out of my whole (fan blowing) kit is just having this cloth at all. It's very helpful. I don't know if you're realizing this, Linus, but they just gave themselves free cleaning. (cloths rubbing) - Hey, yeah. How'd we get suck into this? - How is this fair? Yeah, like what? Oh, this mouse wheel is quite problematic. - I know, right? - It has a lot of little... You didn't even try. - I did. - No, you didn't. - [Leo] It's harder than it looks. - I am doing it right now. (buttons rattling) Don't tell me how hard it is. I know exactly how hard it is. (crew groaning) (bright music) - I can't get in there. - [David] Why don't you combo with the pipe cleaner? - No, this guy wants his device clean. (David laughing) That's what's going on. Hey, why don't you clean my Xbox more properly, okay? Come on, what am I paying you for? - Wait, are you being paid? - I'm just destroying this tool. It has no like, rigidity at all. So I put any amount of pressure on it, it just (imitating pad flopping) flops over. - Well, it's not as young as it once was. (Luke chuckling) - No. - I don't blame myself. - My multi-tool cleaning pack came with Viagra. (fan blowing) - Maybe you guys should team up and make that one immaculate. - It's not even like a bad plot line for the video, but you just know it's his. (David laughing) I feel like the previous owner of this is an indoor smoker. I used to see this all the time when I would do like, PC service repair, (bristles brushing) you'd get this like, thick, gunky, brown - Tar. - Tar on like everything, and it's so hard to clean off. It's very bad for your electronics. - Hard to clean off, yeah, if you don't have the right tool, I guess. This brush is the king at this stuff. The skinny brush. - Clearly, 'cause it's kicking everything everywhere. - Ew, is that a pube? - It's not even his. - Did you get this wet first? (bristles brushing) (upbeat music) - No. - Yeah, that did not make it easier, sir. (fan blowing) It's definitely getting stuff. (vacuum thumping) (crew chuckling) (vacuum tumbling) We're just gonna... (bottle spraying) - Wow, that's going in the... - Yeah, I mean, does this look like my Xbox? (David chuckling) (fan turning off) Are you guys ready for Linus and Luke's Retro Console repair and Refurbishment Shop? - [David] Oh wow. Oh, that was worth every penny, thank you, guys. - [Linus] I am proud. - It actually like, (Xbox thumping) it looks pretty good now. - [Linus] And you did a great job too, Linus. Look how clean that mouse is. - [Luke] It's actually way better, and a lot of what looks dirty here, I think is just deterioration of materials, - Yeah. - To be completely honest. - [Linus] There was nothing I can do about that. - [Luke] Yeah. - At least there's nothing living in it, just like I'm living, with this segue to our sponsor. - Zoho One.

    "transcript": "keyboards are a lifeline of text expression one might say but should one oh you mean huh Bieber oh oh and did I also mention oh all right welcome to our best and worst keyboards out of 2019 it's been a good year in terms of unique releases let's begin after this the NMX t-50 ax air cooler now comes in this gorgeous white finish with an addressable RGB high-pressure fan along with a patented air guide grill to increase air flow the vortex differential fin design helps increase air convection around the heat pipes so the your CPU can stay nice and cool learn more in the description down below as usual all the products will be listed in description below thank you very much the first keyboard I want to highlight as one of my best on the list is the ducky one 2 SF this is a 65% keyboard that is portable affordable cute in some ways and is currently on my workstation desk and it's got so many yes features including a dedicated arrow keys with delete page up-and-down so basically the same functionality on the right side as a TKL keyboard but much smaller and since the F keys are built into the top row you're also saving space there we have a removable noncredit type-c cable extra set of colored axe and key caps for white or black models the key caps are PBT double shot with beautiful light shine through although with some inconsistencies here and there the stabilizers are fine the space bar is beautiful and you can pick this board up with many flavors of MX switches and this is by far the smoothest and most satisfying MX Brown keyboard that I've used with this soft tactile point I personally don't use any of the secondary functionalities like Mouse navigation but it's really cool to have them built-in plus you can record all type of macros to secondary layers or different profiles to really make this keyboard your own and here's a quick sound test the next worthy keyboard on my list is the SteelSeries Apex Pro this one comes in full-size and TKL options as well with many add-on features like a full-size illuminated USB pass-through for peripherals a very comfortable magnetic wrist rest a monochrome display that's pretty useless outside of showing gifts and if you want to change up color or profiles without accessing the software so in that sense is actually pretty useful the best thing about the keyboard are the new Omni point switches that are linear and smooth remind me of Gator and Red's that I absolutely love they are light at 45 grams and have adjustable actuation point that you can set yourself between point four millimeters to three point six millimeters this gives you an option to create your own speed switch which is so cool by setting the actuation point to be quite high or if you love to bottom out and love just a totally different feeling keyboard set the maximum actuation to three point six and bottom out my friend it's nice we've seen similar designs from wooden keyboards but letting you set the actuation point among a range but that's awesome to have more options on the market especially from steel series that is a mainstream gaming brand now we have adjustable actuation point for the masses that is if you're willing to spend a lot of money as the apex pro and the TKL are quite expensive but they sound fantastic let's move on to the next special keyboard I just reviewed it after two months the Razer Huntsman TE this is the gaming TKL keyboard that surprised everyone in the community because Razer listened and delivered we've got a removable type C cable that you can swap for something fancy the bottom row is standard for key cap swapping the included key caps are double shot PBT with a coarse texture that feels nice but picks up dust on the sides over time and there's some lighting inconsistencies throughout otherwise the illumination is absolutely beautiful and bright plus the keyboard comes equipped with razors red optical switches that are insanely fast and light actuating it's 1 millimeter and only require 40 grams of force to actuate this which will not be for everyone it took me about a week to get used to it and after two months of usage I still sometimes rest my fingers on the keys and activate shift ALW or spacebar or something like that on the keyboard you just have to be cautious because the keys are so light the weight of your hand and your fingers will depress the key but this is definitely my keyboard of choice for gaming and the fast and light switches is what you crave the huntsmen te is an easy recommendation for me as long as you don't mind this particular sound and the last best keyboard I have on the list is the Drevo Blademaster TE this one's also tkl keyboard that is quite basic but affordable I don't mind the angular frame it's still low profile but not just a rectangular slab the bottom row standard four key cap swapping the cable unfortunately is non removable but it is non braided and quite flexible which is nice the key caps are standard ABS but we have this multifunction wheel on the side that you can macro to suit your work style and gameplay and we have four flavors of kata on switches with Red's being my favorite which is why I love this keyboard so much there's also a wireless Pro version of the blade master with Bluetooth and 2.4 gigahertz connections this one comes with MX cherry switches a Type C cable a silver body instead of black and the same custom wheel on the left side I would actually not recommend the wireless model because the wireless connectivity ironically has been kind of wonky after the review so switching between Bluetooth and 2.4 gigahertz did not fully work as advertised which is why I would still recommend the blademaster te because it's wired it's still the one I use today it's working fine and the sound profile is delicious alright switching gears let's talk about the most dissapointing keyboard of the year for me which is so unfortunately because I love the original here we have the G Pro X from Logitech I will say I love the hot-swappable nature of the switches on the mainstream gaming brand keyboard and you don't need to buy a Logitech's branded KL switches although they do recommend it because of some tolerances don't listen to them my halo clears fit just fine they did not update the connection it's still using micro USB the bottom row is not standardized despite having such an awesome feature like swappable switches the key caps or abs glossy land and the price at $150 for the keyboard and the $50 for set of switches is just too much when things like GM MK TTL exist that offer a swamp full frame just like the G pro X with so many switch variations at the much lower price point I love the G Pro X keyboard but having a hot swappable frame doesn't justify its price they should have done more now let's hear what the boys have to say for their best and worst keyboards I think you're gonna have a lot of fun editing this D alright Dimitri's so my pick for the best keyboard of 2019 has to go to the Logitech MX keys ever since I reviewed this keyboard this has been my daily driver because I love the low-profile nature of this keyboard most importantly Logitech Flow is absolutely fantastic with this keyboard I'm using me master 3 Mouse along with this keyboard and I can easily switch between my notebook and my desktop PC by just using a single pair of peripherals which is awesome the keys themselves have great feedback it's obviously not gonna give you that mechanical feel when you're using a traditional mechanical keyboard but the MX keys is also a wireless keyboard and the battery lasts really long it also charges via USB type-c and sports fast charging which is nice my pick for the worst keyboard of 2019 has to be the cooler master sk650 in fact they have 3 sk series it's the sk lineup so why is it my worst keyboard of 2019 well even though the Cooler Master targeted this as a low profile mechanical keyboard it really is in low profile because compared to a traditional mechanical keyboard it's really not that slim especially when compared to the iMac keys from Logitech but also the switches are absolutely horrible I mean there's no there's just no life to them when you're typing on it to make things worse the spacing between individual key caps is not even and it's also very sharp so it makes typing super uncomfortable and the backlighting is also pretty bad and it's just way too expensive okay so I'm not a keyboard guy but I did have one choice and that is the g.skill km360 because it basically goes against of what a lot of other companies are trying to do which is hike up the prices of peripherals as much as they can this thing is not gonna be the best keyboard but at 50 bucks if you can still fight for 50 bucks it has everything it has a good frame it has Cherry MX red switches and what I did is I just popped on a $25.00 HyperX putting key cap set with this combination I've been using this as my daily driver for gaming for the better part of four months now and it's really held up well I'm super happy with it so my worst choice and I know some of you will probably say that I'm absolutely crazy but this is the Logitech g915 you can actually see it's getting some dust on it because I haven't been using it I don't like this thing unlike what the G scale is this thing represents everything that's wrong with the peripheral space right now at least the gaming peripherals it's expensive it tries too hard it does have a really good wireless connection but at 330 dollars Canadian for an oversize quote/unquote slim keyboard that's not really slim to me this is where peripherals shouldn't head especially when you have custom keyboards you have some amazing keyboards from the likes of murmillo from Leopold that you can get for a third of the price this is my pick for the worst keyboard of the year alright so that was fun I hope you enjoyed if you have a favorite keyboard of the year what is it and the agree with our worst keyboard selections for 2019 keystrokes down below all the links are in the description thanks much for watching check out this other relevant content we'll see you guys in the next video but I could keep this by by the front entrance and if somebody tries to come into the into the house I could just beat them with it it's sharp enough",

    "transcript": "money shot like I'm gonna cut right to the point here Phanteks does excellent jobs making cases that are affordable and premium so this right here is a $60 enclosure and you get tempered glass included I'd like you to meet the P 300 I know I'm a bit late with this review everyone else released theirs earlier in the day but this is a smaller take on the P 400 from Phanteks which was already a great value in fact a tempered glass edition of that case was my favorite case for the longest time up until fractal released their defined C tempered glass Edition so like I said the P 300 has a smaller chassis than the P 400 that's why it's a 300 not 400 also the basement is kind of like a part of the chassis so you can see and feel the basement on the exterior of the case and the tempered glass actually only goes down to where the basement begins actually think it's pretty cool gives us case a bit of flavor and definitely distinguishes it from its competition also being this is only a $60 enclosure seeing tempered glass on board is definitely a plus and no it's not extra tinted it's just slightly tinted just enough in my book in terms of hardware support we're looking at ATX motherboards and smaller only because there is an indention here kind of like the fractal defined C case that gives more room in the back for cable management cable storage in general I think that this is a worthy compromise most people aren't going to use EI TX cases the few that do are always going to make a big deal about how these cases don't support ei TX but the fact of the matter is a majority of people are using a EXI as motherboards and smaller so I don't see a problem going with the better cable management in the back speaking of which it's very clean back here it's very easy to kind of maneuver cables and store things that you really don't need especially if you don't have a modular power supply I love the space in the p300 it's actually an easier case to build in believe it or not than the P 400 regarding fan and radiator support this actually takes on kind of like an NZXT s340 vibe so you've got a single 120mm fan support in the back you have up to a 140 millimeter fan on top only a single one and it does have a dust filter included just a little magnetic one so at least there's that that's something that the S 340 elite does not include a pretty sure and then up front here you have support for up to a two hundred and eighty millimeter AI oh I have a 240 in there right now you can see there's plenty of room still for a larger radiator but you can't put a triple rat in here and I'm about to show you why so if you remove the front panel of the case you'll find the hard drive tray actually turns sideways so that you can access your drive base from the front this is actually pretty cool and at the same time it does kind of cut into space in the basement so I have a really large power supply here actually there are power supplies larger than this one on the market but this one's considerably larger than the average power supply for a mid tier build and it will not fit including the cable links there's no way to get this power supply to fit in here so I had to use a smaller form factor power supply because the hard drive tray was left intact if you want more space down here you can remove the hard drive tray of course though there's nowhere else to put three and a half inch drives keep in mind this is still considered a mid tower case so there are seven PCIe slots at the rear again that 120mm fan rad support up top you have your motherboard rear i/o cutout down below just a simple power supply mounting system no extra you know hinge or anything like that to worry about here just like your power supply in from the right side of the case the p300 stands firm on the ground with its four large feet I'd say that's about an inch or so of breathing room for the power supply if you orient your fan downward and on the bottoms of the feet you'll find little foam pads to keep things from you know getting scratched up on your desk that's for front i/o the case is sporting a headphone jack microphone jack and two USB 3.0 ports I can't really complain here it's a $60 case so having the XP USB ports would have been nice but at least you got some up here also there is an RGB cycle button up front which will change the color of the power button up top as well as the thin LED strip at the front of the case on top of the basement the p300 also includes extra wiring harnesses if you want to attach some compatible LED strips or even sync it up with your motherboards lighting system pretty cool how they've done this so if you want a full on RGB build or just a rig that is you know suiting one color scheme then you can actually control it all with this one button up top if you really wanted I am a bit concerned about the front panel this has always been fan Texas Achilles heel so there are two very tiny dust filters here and this is basically reminiscent of how much this case is gonna offer you at least four fans up front there is another best filter kind of integrated down here at the base so there are dust prevention mechanisms built into the front panel but the front panel itself is rather constricted I would say this is more restrictive than the typical defined see defined s from factored design also maybe even slightly more restrictive than the s340 elite because there are these grill little slots here and it's not just an open space for air to flow through so this is probably the the most inconvenient thing about the P 300 then again it was also inconvenient for the P 400 snaps in nice and sturdy there are two other issues I have with this case at this point I'm just really being picky because if you consider the $60 price tag this case is a huge bargain I'm gonna recommend this case to anybody looking for a relatively affordable case it also includes some amenities like tempered glass and RGB integration the one thing that I'd like to see in with the basement is a cutout for VGA cables there's not one of those which means you have to route your graphics card cables through the slots at the rear where you would funnily 24-pin at USB 3.0 and such and that's the other thing I want to complain about I'm not the biggest fan of the way they've done this they're angled at 90 degrees so the cutouts are gonna make your cables look slightly and I just crushed and constricted I've liked we're seeing maybe a 45 degree angle here or just simple cutouts facing the right side of the case but I've got to be honest in this regard as well this is a huge bargain huge bargain for 60 bucks cannot stress that enough despite the few downfalls that really I mean you can't you can't chop this case for it's 60 bucks this is one heck of a bargain I'm gonna recommend it to anybody looking for a case that's not $100 this is yeah this is probably the best case of 60 bucks period and I say that with confidence I haven't built in anything this cheap that is this nice to build in it's this easy to build it and that looks this good either as always you can find this product linked in the video description along with this P 400 counterpart slightly large case but it does offer a bit more breathing room for custom loops in one I'd be pretty difficult to fit a custom loop in here you'd have to really cut back on radiators and and things that are fairly important for custom loops if you want to support us on Amazon you can click any of those links in buy products via those links and that will give us a small kickback and we do recycle most of that money back into the channel to bring more content like this actually just went to Best Buy and purchased about 500 bucks worth of storage drive so it does really help us out and it lets us build more pcs like these and in cases that are as beautiful as this one and frankly even more beautiful for 60 bucks this is a great case there are better cases out there I'm gonna be honest but for 60 bucks there is no better case that I've come across that is this great of a bargain if you liked this video be sure to give it a thumbs up thumbs down for the opposite click subscribe but if you had already to stay tuned for more stuff like this on the channel this is science studio thanks for building with us",

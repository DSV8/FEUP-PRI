    "description": "Pick up the Ryzen 7 2700X here:  Also, be sure to check out the six core variant:   - AMD's latest Ryzen revision - dubbed Pinnacle Ridge - relies on a 12nm process and much of Gen 1's internal architecture. The 2700X boasts additional overclocking headroom, a marginal IPC jump, and the same thermal efficiency as before. But how well does it game? How about content creation? Here's why the R7 2700X is a new value king!

    "transcript": "I have been pulling all-nighters for the past three or so days in an effort to compile as much data as possible into a single video without wasting 30 minutes of your time, so let's get started with the horizon 2700 X CPU the subject of today's video I've got about a dozen or so gaming benchmarks to throw your way along with the view synthetics I even have an Adobe Premiere render benchmark if interested in content creating with the CPU and I'll also have a few talking points at the end we can extract from this data my test bench is today consists of the three CPUs listed in the title this video which I hope you read along with respective Z and X chipset boards and 16 gigabytes of Corsair Vengeance RGB Ram clock to 3000 megahertz all three CPUs were cooled with a deep pool captain 360 exa IO and all games were benchmarked in tandem with the EVGA 1070 Ti for the win - triple slot graphics card this one's beefy alright but she stays nice and quiet under load horizon 720 700 X a part of the family codenamed Pinnacle Ridge is an improvement on an architectural level over its 1000 series counterparts and it shows to compare it to the 1700 X because it falls a right in line from a nomenclature standpoint and should from a price standpoint as well the new 12 nanometer process results in an evident IPC jump around 5% or so in my testing it might be a bit higher depending on what you're doing and at no expense of additional power and even when overclocked well beyond 4 gigahertz the CPU stayed well within my comfort zone from a temperature standpoint this was a relief since the two boards included in my reviewer kit from AMD included supplemental 4 & 8 pin EPS ports and on top of the you know standard 8 pin port consumers have not seen anything like this since X 299 but fear not I recorded only 150 watts of peak power draw from the 12 volt leads on both EPS cables while torture testing with Prem 95 signifying an only marginal jump in power demand with the new architecture now a few things to keep in mind before moving to the benchmarks the 1700 X was clocked to 4 gigahertz in all scenarios the 2700 X was clocked at 4.2 gigahertz unless otherwise stated and the 8700 K to 5 gigahertz this is again across all course the 1070 Ti it was left at stock frequencies so let's start things off with Cinebench r15 essentially a thread image render tool these scores rely on architectural efficiency and clock speed we can see the I beseech from the 1700 X to the 2700 X in a relative sense via the blue bars to the left since these tests were conducted at the same frequency 159 to 171 isn't too substantial but the overclocking Headroom on top of this is where the money is I was able to push mine to 4.2 gigahertz across all eight cores on 1.38 five volts and a level one load line calibration the result is a whopping nineteen hundred and five see beyond the multi-core side of things practically dwarfing that of the 8700 k where the blue team shines however is overclock ability of course five gigahertz pushes at single core performance well above 200 CB which is why it has remained at the gaming King up to this point but focusing more on the improvements with risin Geekbench four gives us a closer look at the kinds of raw horsepower gains one should experience when migrating from arisin one the additional overclocking Headroom at the expense of marginal power loads is a huge win for the second gen stuff that and i can finally use XMP profiles without my entire PC shutting down this was always a complaint I had with Rison one from a content creation standpoint the Rison 720 700 x renders a five-minute 1080p video clip 60fps mind you and practically the same time as its higher clocked blue team counterpart clock for clock the red team has this one in the bag you can even stream netflix while you're at it just to be cocky the first game on our list as always is Grand Theft Auto 5 all games by the way have been tested in a 1080p resolution it's the most common by far and it does leverage CPU and GPU power fairly evenly across the board GTA 5 is an excellent port for what it is and this one yields some of the best gains for the 2700 X over the 1700 X jumping from 109 to 133 and then only an extra 6 FPS on average between the 2700 X and the 8700 K it's pretty phenomenal although as 1% and 0.1 percent of all frame rates are also maintained here which is where the boosted clock speech really shines pub G is up next optimization isn't yet on point so in game settings were lowered in most places to compensate the 8700 K performs the best year but only barely only a 6 FPS Delta between it and the 2,700 X for both average and 1% charting again pretty incredible the 2700 X does fall a bit short though in the lowest 1% of frames which could be the results of any number of variables including how my own gameplay played out since nothing in this benchmark was truly standardized moving from pub gene out a fortnight's Battle Royale in 1080p with a high preset things are looking up across the board 166 FPS on average for the 8700 K 146 for the 2,700 X and 139 for the 1700 X the gap between Intel and AMD widens just a bit with this title and it certainly runs smoother on the i7 up next is doom tested an OpenGL for benchmarking purposes where we see a similar story with respect to averages until takes the cake here and oddly enough the 2,700 X suffered tremendously down low with its lowest 1% and 0.1% of frame x I'd like to test a Vulcan in the future to see how this fares out I'm not too sure at this point what attributed to the dip and frame rates down low F 1 2017 has a great built-in benchmark I always run the Australian map in heavy rain to load up the hardware and things in this case spread out just a bit more Intel still on top but a clear advantage exists with the 2700 X over the last gen sure the minimum was a tad lower but things looked especially smooth in game and for all we know that 92 could be an outlier which is why percentage based framerate charting is generally more representative of overall trends universe in box 2 is a relatively demanding title for what it is thanks to active algorithms and particle mapping and in the same earthen sphere of Moon simulation that I always use the 2,700 X fell massively short of the gaming King 86 on average compared to a mere 60 however things down low are much closer 30 verse 29 for the lowest 1% and 27 verse 21 for the lowest point 1% rise of the Tomb Raider in DirectX 12 is another title I was interested in testing due to its inherent Nvidia bias so I was curious to see how things would play out the 2,700 X actually lost to the 1700 X in one of the scenarios but pulled ahead in the latter two while staying within 10 or so frames of the 8700 K on the other side battlefield 1 is a game in which we should expect extra cores to do us a solid and it certainly plays out that way the 2700 X is only 4 frames shy of the 8700 K on average falling slightly further behind with the lower tiers a 10 FPS Delta at 1% and 16 at 0.1% still though we see noticeable gains over the 1700 x8 cores and 16 threads clocked only 200 megahertz higher than a baseline can make a heck of a difference on top of added architectural benefits I threw in planet coaster for fun because it's actually pretty intensive in the ultra preset even on the CPU the trends are to be expected but the 8700 K does pull away with the lower frame rate percentages and lastly which are three in especially graphics intensive title the 2700 X average 112 fps leading the 1700 X by only 5 frames and falling short of the 8700 K by 8 a similar story continues further down the line but it should be noted that numerical improvements Canon do exist with the 2700 X / Gen 1 architecture so AMD is getting awfully close to outperforming the 8700 K the gaming king in major titles all the while boasting additional cores and competitive prices for that multitasking fun speaking of which that's been rise ins calling all along value and multitasking they never claimed to be the best gaming CPUs in the market they're just clearly better value CPUs and with the 2700 X closing a 5% frame rate margin on average between itself and the 8700 K things are only looking better at this point the platform's had several months to mature 2nd gen chips or backwards compatible with last year's boards something Intel should seriously pick up on and pricing is well attractive no other word for it so I want to close with a few additional remarks regarding my experience with the platform and with the 2700 X in particular I haven't by the way even pulled the 2600 X out of its box I'll get to that one shortly this video is all about the 2700 X but what I've noticed is that these CPUs don't really run as hot as I expected them to I don't think I had the best overclocker though I think 4.2 gigahertz across all cores is pretty meh just considering one core at least will turbo to 4.3 it's what it says on the box anyway I haven't actually checked that because I overclocked immediately but it's impressive but it's it just really depends on the chip it's more or less a silicon lottery luck of a draw type thing and if you get a really good chip Wow you're gonna be into 2000 CV territory for centre bench and I imagine your frame rates will be just neck and with that of the 8700 KS and there's something else the msi board I used decided to pump 1.52 volt under the Auto config to the CPU v core which is just a bit uncomfortable I think 1.5 is definitely too high not just for the 360 ml but also the V RMS and the CPU itself right so the board did get pretty hot under torture workloads with prime95 even at one point 4 volts or thereabouts where I had it which is something to keep in mind the temperatures weren't too bad but having a top-down CPU cooler an air cooler in particular would keep those VRMs nice and cool if you have some intakes or exhaust fans at the top of your case that will also do your V RMS a solid now from a value standpoint Pinnacle Ridge definitely has it you can pick up the 2700 X 4 anything near 300 USD you'll be sitting good in the value neighborhood in my book almost as good as feeling like you're ripped off a used car salesman which let's be honest really doesn't happen too much this CPU is a steal for the suggested retail price of 329 and should pose a worthy upgrade for anyone touting architecture as far back as I would say Ivy Bridge and maybe even piledriver bulldozer if you're looking for a workstation a multitasking CPU that can still write games in 1080p and up then the 2700 X is for you don't be afraid by the way to check it out via the link below at least consider it especially for on an older platform now I want to know what you think its pinnacle Ridge something you're considering how do you feel about the platform especially after watching this video and other reviewer videos out there and invite you to comment down below like this video if you thought it was cool and subscribe for more content like this this is science to do thanks for benchmarking with us",

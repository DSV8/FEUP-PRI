    "transcript": "- These key caps, then it just check it out. (key popping) Whoa, (fire roaring) that actually hit Jono. (people laughs) That's insane. Ergo keyboards can be kind of weird and inaccessible sometimes, but these ones seem to not be that. It looks like they're not that ugly and they don't look that hard to learn how to use. I'm particularly interested in this one. I got two here. These are both from Cloudnine. One of them is a 10 key lists and way more compact. The other one you can't really see in the picture, but it's way wider and it has a number pad and everything like a full keyboard, which you almost never get on Ergo boards. So I'm excited to look at that one. That's check them both out, starting with that one. Now don't be confused by the Cloudnine name and logo that looks almost exactly like the Cloud9 gaming team logo. Almost exactly. There's no affiliation as far as I know. I thought this keyboard would be wider than this boxes, so although this place was probably stacked in the boxes. Yep, I got one module here, it's pretty heavy and it looks like pretty high quality injection molded plastic. It's like it's not really printed in and cropped here. USB-C interface there. That's probably going to connect it to the other module, but yeah, you can already see, it's got the four navigation keys, number pad. I believe these are using browse. Yeah, cool. Normal arrow keys and then it sweeps up into this tilted area, tented area so that you're reducing pronation. Like you don't want your arm to be flat like that. It scissors your radius and all the bones in your arm and pinches tissue, which can cause RSIs. It's probably the reason you're interested in an Ergo board to begin with. So that's cool. I don't know if you can adjust that tilt level. I think it's just us a set seven degrees. And then, you know what, it's just like kind of your posture. The best thing to do a lot of the time is just to be changing it all the time. So if your hand is going to be going from this to this and then back that's probably better than just being in a static position, regardless of that position. You can see that there's probably some RGB action on here, like an under glow. So we're gonna have to get this powered on and plugged in eventually. There is, you can see it's a split keyboard, but it does fit together. Just friction, I don't think there's magnets. Oh yeah, it does kind of snap. This is kind of glassy, glossy, middle section Isn't flawless. It's got like some dimples or kind of bumps in it. I don't really love that. Then of course there's this dial, which is pretty cool. It clicks. See how it rocks. That's not awesome and that could be useful as far as I understand it you can reprogram it so you could use it to scroll a web page which is dope because then you don't actually have to take your hand off the keyboard, which I hate doing. You wanna keep your hands on the keyboard as much as possible and so if I can scroll like that, that's dope. I don't have to use page up and down or the arrow keys. I think I have more control or fidelity with this. So that'd be cool. You can also use it. You can revamp it apparently for games and for media like volume. So I have to check that out that little bit. There's no mention of software on the website. So I don't know exactly how we're going to do these things. It looks like there's some macro keys on the side here. It's nice. Going back to what I said about being accessible, a normal staggered party layout. Some Ergonomic keyboards like the one I use at my desk have an Ergodox linear layout. The keys are just straight up and down and like in columns rather than being diagonal like this, which is a typical. Most keyboards are like this, staggered. So that's what I'm saying. It's not gonna take a big learning curve to get used to this one. Hold on, I just wanna see what else is in here. Of course there's just... Oh, there's a little cable, I guess that's for joining the two modules and there's a long cable. That's gotta be for charging or connecting the PC. Is this thing not wireless? The deuce, oh, this is cool. It's an angled cord actually has a little 45 on there. That is just a nice touch. They didn't have to do that. Cool, I like that. This is pretty slim. That's far enough for, I think for most people to spread it about this wide, that's gonna make it pretty even for your shoulders. You could even put your mouse in here if you want. And that might actually honestly, with how wide this thing is when it's spread apart like this look how far your mouse would be. Can you even see that? I'm way over here at this point. So if you are a gamer and you're bored, you just don't really need the number pad and stuff. You probably want to look to get into TKL out, which I will unbox a second. Wait, what? No, the tether cord plugs are directional. Both plugs must angle inwards. You actually have to do it that way. What do they mean? Must, like it just won't work. I'm gonna test that. Oh, you can actually change the dial mode. I'm gonna try all this stuff right after this message from our sponsor. - Thanks to the HULKMAN for sponsoring this video. The HULKMAN Alpha 85s helps you jumpstart your dead car battery with no aid needed. It works in temperatures up to -40 degrees Fahrenheit. And it jump starts with just a five minute charge. So you can get back on the road quickly and safely. The large battery can hold up to 60 jumps starts on a single charge with up to 18 months on standby. Learn more in order yours today at lmg.gg/hulkmansc. Link below. - Apparently it has per key RGB and again, I don't know how that's accomplished. Oh, cool. Yeah, so there is this kind of diffused side glow thing going on. This thing's lit up. The keys are lit up. I know it has some programmed patterns but I'm gonna have to look at this to find out how to control them. Red. Can I make a breathe or something though? I might not just want to static color. I don't know if the side is RGB. Is there a rainbow one? Wait, here we go. It's breathing. It's rainbow, set. And that is independent from the keys. That's kind of cool. Do you want to customize the individual key back lighting, program macros and more? You can do it all with the PC app. Yes, there is an app. Let's go get it. This software is not commonly downloaded. Cloudnine if you give me a virus. Man, is this just an edge thing? 'Cause it takes a long time to download crap This is really annoying. So there's no devices connected - [Man] Was it because of the cable? - 'Cause this is backwards and this is not backwards. This is how it shows it in the picture. But I'll try it. No, it's not a cable issue. Okay, now I'm gonna plug in my other keyboard and see if that works. So the right module you can see is like half the size. This one has a wrist rest kind of integrated into it. Does that come off? It feels like Velcro. It's Velcro, comes with the key cap puller. Here's my cables. Okay, well I think we can pretty much find out everything I wanted to find out about this board with this board. I guess some percentage of customers will have an issue like that. Hopefully not many. Okay, you can actually remap everything graphically in here. I just made my S key into 8 key. That's not cool. You can't use your keyboard without that, you have to actually just use your mouse. Yep, the lighting has its own tab and okay, here's all the programmed patterns, but it said I can do per key. So how do I do that? Eew yellow. Eew, you who chooses yellow in almost anything? Okay, there's a, there's a speed ramp here for how fast you want the pattern to go. You can change the brightness of the pattern. I don't see this per key thing, but I don't care. I wouldn't use that anyway. (paper squawks) Right now let's look at this wheel. (keyboard wheel clicking) Oh, that's not a good sound on this one. So the color that it shows actually indicates what mode it's on. It says when it's white, it's volume up and down and the clicking would mute it. When it's red, you can switch applications like I guess that would be like Alt tab, and then you select the application by clicking. That seems useful. Roll up or down when it's green and when it's blue, it's your, oh, it's just the brightness of the keyboard. And then you can click it to change your keyword color. That's okay. I probably wouldn't use that, but I'd use it sometimes. Okay, we've got red. Whoa, there it is. It is Alt tab. Oh my God, you guys, this is so counterintuitive. You scroll clockwise, but it goes to the right or to the left. It's going left as I... That is backwards to me. Am I the only one? I think I'd get used to this counterclockwise thing, but it's just stupid. Horizontal scrolls for use. So if you don't have that in your mouse, I would use that a lot on here. If you're using spreadsheets or something like Trello, that's really wide. I would probably use that a lot. I personally prefer Ergonomic keywords that have thumb clusters. I like to use those a lot, but as I said, that's less accessible. This is more like normal. I think the ten keys, this is a newer product. The box is a little sexier. Now, if I go to blue, that's vertical scroll. I'm hoping that's going to be weapons change. Okay, so here I am in CS code the Mouse Scroll Wheel changes weapons. Oh yeah, look at that. It does work. It's imprecise. You probably end and sanctify with your wast fingers than the number keys, but if I had larger hands, I might and I forgot really good at touching that knob. I like the extra versatility. You could pretty much just have it split like this until your gaming and then you can go like that or even just get this out of the way. Wow, do you hate doing Ctrl + A? Well, you've got a select Alt button. Oh, and this one actually has some legs on it too. That's nice. So what you're doing there, usually Ergo keyboard, you're expecting to see these legs on the top and they make them tilt this way, but that's actually bad because you're extending, this is called extension, this will be flection. When you extend that's bad for your wrist. This actually puts it into flection by lifting up this side of it, which is more Ergonomic. So, I think these are good keyboards. I think they're a good option for Ergonomic keyboards. They've got lots of features. They're not that expensive. Some Ergo Keyboards are like $400. I like these. I like the big one with the number pad. You don't see that often on an Ergo keyboard. I don't know where I'm going to put my mouse. If I don't have a that keyboard but these are cool. They're worth looking at. If you like this video, check out some of our other keyboard and button, maybe check out one with Plouffe. He just, you know, he has a calming presence.",

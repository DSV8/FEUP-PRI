    "transcript": "- There's a new Nest Learning Thermostat, a new Google TV Streamer, and Gemini Intelligence is coming to Google Home. The Google TV Streamer 4K, that just rolls off the tongue, is Google's newest iteration of its popular Chromecast. Dongles be gone, this doesn't dangle from your TV's HDMI port. Instead, it's a sleek, slanted box that sits under your TV, and comes in Porcelain and Hazel, which is a soft green. The matching remote control has been super sized, and is bigger, with more buttons, including a new Favorite button that you can program yourself. Google says the new Google TV is 22% faster. It has an ethernet port, USBC for power, and HDMI 2.1. It features Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, and spatial audio when using devices like Pixel Buds. But most importantly, it has expanded storage, to 32 gigabytes. Google's Gemini is here, offering overviews of the shows and the option to generate an AI screensaver from a prompt. But best of all, there's a button on the back of the box that will ring the remote when you lose it in the couch. The new Google TV Streamer is also a Google Home Smart Home Hub. It works with Matter and is a thread border router, all of which means you can use it to connect and control smart home devices locally over your home network. Another neat, smart home feature and one I'm really excited about is the new Google Home Panel. This appears on the TV and for the first time, let's you view and control Google Home devices right from your TV. This includes streaming cameras, controlling lights and thermostats, running automations. You can also program the new Favorite button on the remote to call up the Smart Home panel. The panel is launching first on the streamer, but I'm hoping it'll come to other Google devices too. The Google TV Streamer 4K costs 99.99 and is coming September 24th, but enough about that, this is what I really wanted to see. The New Nest Learning Thermostat and its new little temperature sensor. Google's Thermostat has been completely redesigned to look like a Pixel Watch. Yes, yes, it really does look like a giant Pixel watch, but it does retain a lot of what made the original Nest Learning Thermostat so iconic, including the physical dial, or bangle, for adjusting the temperature. This is the fourth generation of the thermostat, which first launched 13 years ago, and it's the biggest change yet. The profile is much bigger with a 60% larger edge to edge display with a curved lens over the 2.7 inch LCD screen, but the profile is also slimmer. There are three colors, polished silver, polished gold, and polished obsidian or black in non-Google speak. It does look beautiful in person and the dial feels solid and satisfying in your hand. The biggest size, making it easier to scroll through the device's settings, and touch and press to select on its new UI. The thermostat has a new solely radar sensor on board, and this enables a dynamic Farsight. This features realtime weather animations like rain and thunder, and the Farsight is also fully customizable with the option to choose from date, time, indoor temperature, outdoor temperature, and new, outdoor air quality. The New Nest Thermostat works with Matter, so you can control it from any Matter-compatible smart home platform, yes, including Apple's home kit, but there's no thread, just wifi. The device's learning capabilities have got better, according to Google, and it creates its personalized schedule for your heating and cooling faster than previous generations. The device will also now suggest its changes before making them if you prefer or you can just let it do its thing. Also, when the thermostat is changing something and you want to know why, you can press on the screen and it will tell you what it's doing. There are some new energy saving features that react to the outdoor temperature, natural cooling and adaptive eco are the names and these apparently will help you save even more energy. Overall, Google is saying that the Nest Thermostat will save you, on average, 12% for heating and 15% for cooling. There is also a new temperature sensor, which sadly, still don't include occupancy sensing, but can now average the temperature across your home. The Nest Learning Thermostat also works with more systems and is now compatible with humidifiers, dehumidifiers, ventilation systems, split units, heat pumps, and more. The Nest Thermostat costs $279.99 and include the temperature sensor. It's coming to the US and Canada only, sorry Europe. Google also announced it's bringing Gemini models to Google Home with some really exciting new features that process images and generates text from your Nest cameras to provide a summary that describes exactly what it's seen. The ability to create smart home automations with natural languages is also on the way, such as when someone gets home between 3:30 and 5:00 PM on weekdays, turn on the garage light and broadcast a message. This type of thing should make it easier to set up Google Home automations and easier to use Google Home in general. Google also teased that it's working to supercharge the Google Assistant to better understand you, be more natural, and be more capable, as well as have some new voices. - [Device] Pluto is no longer classified as a planet. It was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union. - I didn't get to see any of this in action, but if Google can deliver on all this, it will be a big change. The new Google TV stream of 4K and the New Nest Learning Thermostat fourth gen, are much needed upgrades to two iconic products, and I'm looking forward to getting my hands on them both and putting them through their paces. Thanks so much for watching. I think that new thermostat looks really sweet, or does it look a bit too much like a Pixel watch? What do you think?",

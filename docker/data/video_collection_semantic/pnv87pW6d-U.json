    "transcript": "- I like to think we take a very professional approach to our network infrastructure around here. - Are you joking? - Which is to say that I really hope that nobody in there or up there or around there really, really needs internet because Jake and I are about to YOLO, zero preparation, make and install a brand new router that should be able to help us take full advantage of a greater than 10 gigabit internet connection that we're going to be upgrading to down the road. - What, are we? - I thought we were - No. - Oh. - We didn't have 10 gig before, you lied to everyone. - Did I? - Yeah. - Well, we had 10 gig ish - Well now we have 10 gig everywhere. - Neat. And we also have this sponsor. Privacy.com. Privacy.com lets you shop online with virtual credit cards that offer way more security and control than convention ones. Click the link in the description and get $5 to spend on your first purchase when you sign up. (upbeat techno music) - Are we just getting right into? - I think so, because I don't know anything about it. I didn't even know that we were getting a new router until I walked down to logistics and I was like, oh, what's this box from Supermicro, and they were like, oh, that's the new router. And I was sitting here going well, hold on a second. Since when to Supermicro make routers? And then you were like, since a long time, actually. - Our existing router is a Supermicro box. - Yeah, actually I did know that. - This is basically the same box, just the more strong. - Okay, but do we even need a faster, more strong router? - Questionable, but ours is like Skylake. It's like kind of old now. - Holy crap, it is really? - I know it's old, man. - Man, how much power does that thing draw? - Probably a good amount. I mean this one I don't think is gonna draw nothing either. - We should benchmark it. What the hell? This thing has how many power supplies in it? - I'm pretty sure these are 800 wat power squares. - Shut up. - Yes. 800 wat max. - 800 Wat power supplies. What the hell are you planning to do with this thing? - Go, go fast. - Ha man. I'm so excited to kill everyone's internet shortly. Hey, we're not gonna kill their internet are we? - Sorry to kill everyone? - No, their internet. - Oh, to kill their internet. No, no, no, no, no, no. We got this. Oh our current router. Okay, which is da, da. Oh, where the hell is it? Yeah, that's right. It's mounted at the back. Oh God. - [Jake] Good luck. - I might end up just selfie filming this on my phone, Brandon. Not gonna lie. I don't think you're gonna use this. Why is there a CPU pillow in there? - [Jake] I was sitting back there. - From Lttstore.com. - [Jake] I was, it was not planted. I was actually sitting back there. - [Jake] You gonna selfie cam it? - Yeah, I'm gonna selfie cam it. - [Jake] All right, okay. - Yo, what's up? All right. We're going back into the depth of the server room. Ah, the cable management back here used to be better back when I did it. - [Jake] What do you mean? - And then a lot worse when I did it. We actually used both sides of our rack. And the reason for that is that we used to have so much storage in the front. So many storage servers that there wasn't enough room to have all of our switching in the front. So we moved all of it to the back. It's only patch panels in the front. So here's all of our switches, both POE and otherwise for our fiber stations, as well, yeah, there we go. As well as our RJ 45 stations. And then if we go a little bit, ah, yes, right in the middle of all of it hiding in there, we've got our Supermicro pfSense box. The power for this thing, I think actually comes out the front that, oh no it doesn't. Oh crap. I gotta take the side off the cabinet. Bloody hell nothing is ever easy. Ah, yes, there it is. You can see it's really shallow compared to, even to our network switches. And that was by design because we knew we were gonna have other things in the front of the rack and they could interfere with it if it was really long. I just need to, oh my God. Seriously. - [Jack] We should move it. Hey. - It is way at the back. Where even. - [Jake] Would it be easier to... - The power cable is at the very other end. I can't even point at it let alone get my arm in there. - [Jake] I have an idea. - You have an idea you say. - [Jake] We could... - We could climb the server rack. Yes. I like it. Good idea Jake. - Okay. Well he's doing it. I was gonna say we could move one of the patch panels in the front and then just get at it from the front. - [Linus] No, I got this. - He's got it. - Oh, that's a pro. Oh my God. It's so hot in here. No, it does not have a redundant power supply. - [Jake] That one doesn't? - It does not. So I will be cutting out internet. Do you think they need? - [Jake] For a while. It'll take a couple minutes. - A couple minutes. Do you think they need internet though? I think it's this one. So we're gonna find out real quick styles here. I have no idea what I just unplugged. Everything here is still powered. - [Jake] That's not it, dude. - What is going on here? What just happened? - [Jake] What did you just unplug? - The lights are out. - [Jake] It's this one, whatever this one is. - Oh wait, what are you pulling on? Oh, I see it. I see it. Okay, it's out. Okay, where's my thing real quick? Oh my God. Where's the thing? - [Jake] Where's the thing? - I don't know here. - [Jake] Holy (bleep), well I'm so sorry entire company of people that are trying to work. This is the most expensive power test we've ever done. - So we got our little power meter thing. We wanna know how much more efficient the new one is. So we gotta test the old one. - It might not be more efficient. - What? What do you mean it might not be more efficient? I thought that's the whole point. - It's technically a higher TDP CPU. - What are you talking? Well, why do we even need it then? - Well, because why not? It's got 25 gigs. So if we did upgrade down the road. - Oh. - And our old one is so old, it's like five years old now. - Okay, how do we turn it on? - Did you actually break it? - I don't know, it's not turning on. - Here. Plug it back into normal power for a second. Let's just take a Gander. Okay. Hold on here, hold this. This is so not, why are we even doing this right now? - Because I wanna know the power consumption savings. Okay, yeah that works. So what's, is this thing not working? - [Jake] It doesn't have a screen light up. Okay. - Go get the basic one. - Oh my God. - Get the basic one Jake. - Beep, beep, boop, boop. - I've got this - I'm so sorry entire company. - Run Jake. - [Jake] Here, catch. Catch - Oh gosh. All right. Let's go back and start working on the new server for the time being. Then we can come back and check the power consumption after. This was supposed to be a very short side quest. - Okay. I got the old server pulled up here. I think it's this one right here. - Oh nice. - It might not be the exact one 'cause this is silver, but it's the same specs, so. - Xeon D 21, 46. - Look, look this up on Arc. - One of the cool things about the Xeon D class processors, that was one of the reasons that we ultimately went with a pfSense box rather than a purpose-built router, Was that these Xeon D chips had this like encryption. Oh right, I can't look it up. - Oh. Oh my God. Why can't you look it up Linus? - Well, the site can't be reached. So it could be that Intel Arc is down. - Yeah. That's the problem. What's the other options? - Well, it could be that your wifi install is not working correctly. - Anything else? - Really bad luck. - Yeah. - Anyway, they have hardware accelerated encryption. And what I had thought at the time was that this would allow for very fast remote access when I'm off site to dump footage or do whatever else. But unfortunately, whether it's an open VPN software limitation, or... - It's probably an open VPN thing. - Probably an open VPN thing. We were never really able to take advantage of that. But we do have a new solution to that which doesn't require this, which raises the question. - Zero tier. Why exactly are we using a pfSense box anymore anyway, rather than a purpose built router? - Because pfSense is great. Actually what we should use, if we were going like crazy high speeds, say we had a hundred gigabit internet, we might actually have to use a switch that has routing capabilities built in. 'Cause when you get to that level of performance, like pfSense, it can't even think about doing that speed. - Right. And the reason for that is that pfSense uses a general purpose X 86 CPU, just like any other server from Supermicro would. In fact there's no reason that we couldn't use this particular server as a virtualization server or as a storage server, would just kind of suck in those roles. It's not really designed for it. Whereas a high end router from the likes of someone like a Cisco, is actually using an ASIC that is specifically designed for network switching. - Yeah. The other thing is you can use a server that has no business being a router or a computer that has no business being a router with pfSense. In fact, for our land party, we used a dual 32 core AMD epic box to run pfSense 'cause that's what I had lying around. - pfSense is based on Free BSD, which means that the hardware compatibility is actually excellent. Both with modern components and even very old components. So turning your old computer into a file server. and then your old ancient computer into a pfSense router, is totally viable as long as power isn't super expensive where you're from. Did they completely pre build this for us? Do we even have any work to do? - Well what is this Ram here? I feel like we should upgrade the Ram. I mean we don't. - What is this Ram here? Those are like some DDR one ass lookin'... - No it's a 64 gig, 3,200. That's a nice sticker Ram right there. - Oh, oh. I thought these were individual long Ram packages. - No. - So I just didn't even recognize it at all. - That's a 64 gig dim right there, brother. - We're working on it Dan. - Well. - Jake unplugged the thing. - [Dan] Oh I'm sorry, I blamed you. - You should have, I didn't unplug anything. What are we gonna call this thing, New pfSense? - [Linus] Sure, yeah. New pfSense. - I'm gonna call it pfSense two. - We do have a small problem though. Before we can build it, I have to sign out this memory and they need internet. (laughs) It it working? - [Jake] Send them a photo. - Oh, it's back up. Nice. Eight gigs, 3,200. - I checked our current router presently has 32 gigs only. D-2796 NT. It's 121 TDP. Woo. Let's see. - Did we get a lot more cores for that? - Yeah, I think so. I think it's a 12 core. It's a 20 core. (laughs) What is this right now? It's a, we're going from eight to 20 cores. - I also wanna put an Optane SSD in here. - What do you mean? This is 660-P in there. - Yeah, I wanna go Optane. - Five, 12 gig 660-P. - I want Optane. - I would actually like to put two drives. - Now, this is interesting. If you take off the cooler, you can see, this is one of Intel's BGA style Xeon CPU. So these are not intended to be inserted into a socket. They're intended to be soldered directly to the motherboard for use in appliances that are not really intended to be upgraded like say for example, routers like this one. - To be clear. - Pitch me. - The reason I asked for this. - Yeah, 'cause I still don't fully understand that. - We were gonna go maybe 20 gig and I was like, yo, we're gonna need a bigger router 'cause the other one's only 10 gig. This guy has dual 25 gig on it, which is pretty cool. Obviously that's not the case anymore. - Yeah, it was really expensive. So I kiboshed it. - So we did upgrade. We went from 5.5 gig WAN to 10 gig full. So we actually get proper 10 gig now, which is nice. 10 gig everything. - Okay, I should explain. I wasn't lying, okay. We had 5.5 gig to the internet in general and then the additional four and a half gig. We did have a 10 gig link was to Vanix, the Vancouver Internet Exchange, which probably is where the bulk of our traffic is coming through anyway. You download anything on Steam. You download a Windows update. - I don't actually think steam is connected to Vanix. - Oh I'm pretty damn sure. - There's not that many things connected to it. If you look at the Vancouver Internet Exchange like total traffic, their total traffic peaks at like 80 gigabit. - Let look at who's connected through Vanix. - It's small. You got Amazon. - Amazon. Okay. I know Googles through there. - Just because they participate doesn't necessarily mean that all the traffic's going through CloudFlare there. - I don't think it was actually that misleading to say that we had a 10 gig internet connection. - [Jake] Wow, that's a big chip. That's like LGA 1700. Well BGA 1700? - Yeah, I know it's wild to me that it's just soldered directly to the board. - It is FFC BGA 25-79. - But the thing is I'm not even mad about it because this is not the kind of device that would ever get a CPU upgrade within the reasonable service life of it. You deploy this, you fricking forget about it. It fails. You rip it out, you put in another one. That's just how these customers work. - Yeah. - Are you sure you don't wanna put another drive in here? - I would kind of like to do redundant drives. I'm kind of surprised there isn't two AMBA twos in here. - I wanna put Optane in it. - I think there's the 118 right there. - No, I don't wanna use the 118, 64. What do you need storage for in a router? - Well, if we do statistics or something. - How much are you gonna need? - Look brother. - 64 gigs is a lot of gigs in statistics. - These have been sitting here for so long. - The 64's have been sitting here for longer. - Then put them back. And they'll sit there some more. - Oh my God. There's so many... - If I have to swap these down the road, I'm going to, I'm gonna explode. - Yes I will. - Let's go look at what our current box is using. If it's like less than 30 gigs, we can use those. Okay, the drive on there right now is 26 gigs formatted. So a 64 is double, it's double. He wins. All right. - Shout out Silverstone by the way. If there's some random bull (bleep) and you need it, Silverstone probably makes it. So we got redundant discs. We got redundant power supplies. Now that's a big upgrade and we saw why that's so important. You never know when some rogue is gonna sneak into your server room and unplug your shiz. I have no idea what I just unplugged. - Yeah, you never know. - You never know. The reason that I wanted to use these is actually because they're very, very unlikely to fail in this application compared to NAND flash, which wears out quickly as you write to it and erase it and then rewrite to it. Optane is more DRAM like in that you can write to it many, many more times before you are likely to experience a failure. So yes, they're super low capacity. They're not great performance. These particular drives, I think only link at PCIe Gen three by two, but we don't need the performance. I just want the resiliency to know that if we never upgrade this thing again, which we probably wouldn't need to, 20 cores in a router, this will still be running 10 years, 15 years from now. We've upgraded to quad channel memory. We've upgraded to dual drives, dual redundant drives. We have put on thermal grizzly, thermal compound, and we are ready to close it up. Now this is not a 25 gig fiber module. - Oh it should negotiate, no problem. - This takes these 25 gig capable SFP plus ports. So we plug that in there, and it converts them to whatever we want. So in our case, it's 10 gig RJ 45, but we could also go to fiber, add up to 25 gig if we wanted to run to well, somewhere with fiber. - We could do 50. - Do 50? Oh and just trunk them? - Yeah, but.... - How would you get it out of there? - Yeah. - We could remove one of our redundant drives. - And then put a really fast network card in here. I set Zeta Fest to a mirror and selected both of the discs and it's installing now. What if these need updates? - I bet there's something new. - Well that's for a later Jake to figure out. - Yeah, screw that guy. (laughs) I'm gonna go check the power consumption of our current box. Aw man, we're so close. So close to nice power consumption. Man, we are gonna save like nothing. It's only 68 Watts. - Two 10 gig, two 25 gig. - Wow, that's awesome. - Yeah. - I think our current one is two 10 SFPs and then four 10 RJ 45's. - Truthfully, there's not really much of a benefit to that unless we had multiple WAN connections because realistically you would just set up your switch with VLANs if you wanted to have separate isolated networks behind your router. - Which we do. - But hey, it's there. - Yeah. - Ya know? - Yeah. - Hey. - Right, the default is gonna be a weird IP. Do you have a, wow look we're in the right spot right now. This thing. - It's kids today, right? They don't finish sentences. - Correct. Ha, ha, oh my God. It's micro USB. Jesus Christ. Do we have a two and a half gig one? - Yeah, isn't that cool? - Oh whoa, it's just a module? - Yeah. - Oh, but it's thick. - Well, yeah. - Wow. That is cool. - Oh, what took you so long, Jake? Geez. Some of us just find PAG cables so much faster than other people. It's in. - Very nice. - Now we could configure all of this from scratch, but that would be really stupid because A, it would take a long time and B, the odds of making a mistake when you're configuring your router, especially when you have a setup that's as complex as ours is very high. And I'm not saying that our setup is like ace tier complex, but it's complex enough that you can make a mistake. There are a few things that we're going to have to change even once we restore from our old configuration. And that's the identity of our network interfaces. 'Cause they're gonna have names like IXE zero. - Yeah. They'll be like IXL one. They might even line up, honestly. The only thing that won't line up is probably the 25 gig, but I'm just gonna, they'll line up enough. It's fine. Interface mismatch detected. Please resolve the mismatch. - No way, oh, that's so cool. Just as part of the import process? - Yeah. - Wow. - Is there a 25 gig one not showing? - I mean, we could just use 10 gig for now. What do we care? Let's just use the 10 gig ports. - They're fiber. We need to media convert. I do have a way we could do this though. What we can do very smart hack, is we can take our SFP module, put it in one of the switches that has an SFP port in its own VLAN, like an untagged VLAN. And then you just put it back into here, RJ 45 and it just passes the traffic over it. It's not stupid. They do it actually all the time. - Okay. Something we didn't quite explain properly before. The reason this matters is that our incoming internet connection is fiber. So we wouldn't even be using an RG 45 converter. We would going be going straight into these ports and pfSense, at least in its current iteration, doesn't appear to have drivers for it. - So this is our WAN. This is our LAN. We'll have to patch the SFP through the switch, like I said before, but I already set up the VLAN. So we're like. - Theoretically, we just plop this in. We're good to go? - Yeah, I mean all the VLANs are broken. But those are for non-essential stuff. I can fix that later. - Yeah. I couldn't help noticing that it's not super accessible. - Yeah. Some idiot put it not at the top. - [Linus] I didn't have a choice. - Okay, but to be fair, this one's not on rail, so. - [Linus] It's not? - No, we could pull it out. Move these two down, put it at the top. - There it goes. - [Jake] Oh, you did it. - I pressed the power buttons. - [Jake] Okay, well here. So lets, we have to be very, oh God (bleep) dammit. - And now it's unplugged. - [Jake] Well good, cool. Sorry everyone. Hope you didn't need internet. I'm gonna do this very carefully as if this gets damaged. So the VLAN is set on that port. Cool, it lit up it's compatible. That's very good sign. - [Jake] All right, I moved our fiber, which was plugged in here on our old router over to this switch. And these two ports are configured as an untagged VLAN. So it's just gonna act as basically a media converter to convert this fiber into an RJ 45 that we can plug into the new router. - [Linus] Okay, so this boy. - [Jake] Needs to come out now - [Linus] Just comes out. - [Jake] And then I'm thinking we move these down and put it at the top. - [Linus] No I don't feel like doing that. - [Jake] No we should, because this is just loose. And then this one just needs to be unbolted and it'll just fall. - Oh my God, I feel like we're asking for trouble. - It's worth it. It's worth it. Oh God. Be careful with the fiber, eh? - Yeah, yeah. That's actually just. - [Jake] It's fine, just... - If we break that we have no internet. - [Jake] Actually, I can totally just patch it. It's fine. - Okay. - [Jake] Holy (bleep) it's out. That's been in that spot for like five years. - Cool. - [Jake] Four years. - It's a warm boy. - [Jake] Okay. - Really? You really want to move these down? - [Jake] Yes, yes, yes. - Oh my God, they're live right now. - [Jake] No they're not. They don't have internet. - Well, yeah, but I mean they're like on. - [Jake] Yeah, but that's just the wifi one. Oh boy. There's two sitting on top of this. - Well, yeah, it's pretty saggy. - [Jake] I got my hand in there now. - Okay. - [Jake] Sorry Brandon. - Yeah. - [Jake] Hope you weren't trying to film or anything. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Okay. Just go, just go. Just keep going. - I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. - [Jake] It only kind of hurts. Ah, that was actually not that bad. Oh, thank God. Now the pfSense can just go on top. - [Jake] Oh, I'm so happy. So much better. I've been wanting to do this for literally six years. You're doing great Brandon, thanks. Oh, we gotta do the redundant power. (bleep) - [Jake] Problem for later Jake? - Yeah later Jake can deal with that. - Okay, screw that guy. (laughs) - Okay, wow. This one's quite a lot deeper than the old one. - Yeah, it's sick. - Oh God. - [Jake] Oh my God. Be careful. Don't hit the sprinkler. - Well, I don't want to. - Yeah, what am I guiding again? - Absolute chaos, from the back. You gotta make sure it doesn't run over any cables. Like the fiber. - Yeah, I see the fiber. The fiber's good. Just stick it in the hole. - Yeah, I'm working on it. - Hard and fast. - It's stuck. - Nah, keep going. You're fine. - It's stuck. - Nah, you're good. Keep going. - No, I'm pushing on it and it's not. Ah, what was that? - Ah, it's just the fans. There we go. - Wee, okay. - See the patch cable. Okay, let's go see if it's working. - What are the odds? Wait, we haven't plugged in the management port yet. - Well that is providing our DHCP. So the management doesn't exactly work when the DHCP is off. - You might just have to reboot that ubiquity switch again for wifi. - Yeah. Well, here. - No I'm up. Holy crap. - Gotta love pfSense. Am I right? - Just like that. Wikipedia black death plague, right there. Lttstore.com. Early reviews of the backpack are in and it's flippin' awesome. - Good quality bag. - It finally happened. - What happened? - We did a network infrastructure thing that actually only had the scheduled amount of downtime. - Well, except when you unplugged it just to check the power. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Minor details, Jake, Minor details. We took a config, imported it, (snaps) and it just worked. - We're just ignoring all the VLANs - You're not gonna do a victory lab? - We're ignoring all the VLANs that aren't on right. - Well. That's later Jake's problem. Yeah, screw that guy. Oh, okay. So you're gonna run fast.com and I'm gonna run this one? Honestly, you can't take this stuff seriously because basically we're gonna be limited by the speed of the host of the speed test. Not by our own speed. - [Jake] They use multiple servers now. It's pretty fast actually. - Yeah. - Okay, I'm running. - Okay. I'm now running too. - Yeah, it said we got to 5.6 gigabyte. - Okay, and that's exactly what we're rated for to the internet at large then isn't it? - Yeah well, theoretically they told me it has been upgraded now, but I can't seem to get anything faster than 5.5 gig. I think there's a little tweaking that needs to be done. Oh, well, so we got up to 5.6 gigabit. - Yep. How's our CPU usage, RAM usage? - 0% CPU, 4% RAM. We're using 700 megs of storage. Did we just build the most overkill router? (laughs) - Well they're kind of hot actually, 56 degrees. It's been a few days and we've had the opportunity to do a bit more research into the issues we were having with our Intel 25 gigabit nic in pfSense. It turns out that while the nic in question and Intel E823-C wasn't released yesterday, drivers spur were only added to Free BSD. The operating system that pfSense is based on back in March of this year. (coughs) Linux has had support since early 2020. (coughs) Unfortunately the current release of pfSense, that's version 2.6 and the upcoming 2.7 are still running Free BSD 12.3, which does not include the new drivers. That left us with a couple of options. Either we continue using a network switch to convert the incoming SFP fiber signal into an RJ 45 ethernet connection that pfSense actually has drivers for, We install compatible nic like a Mellanox Connect X series, or we find a different operating system. This is where OPNsense came into play. It's a fork of pfSense. That's also based on Free BSD, but the open source team at OPNsense is typically a lot faster when it comes to updates, meaning the latest version of it does include drivers for our 25 gig nic. Woo! Now the process of converting over was fairly easy since many of the configuration options and a lot of the user interfaces, very familiar. I mean, it is a fork after all. We went ahead and reinstalled the old router running pfSense in the meantime, and then manually copied over the configuration. Now the hardest part would've been manually copying our hundred plus static DHCP reservations, but I found a cool script on GitHub that can automatically convert from pfSense to OPNsense or even the other way around. Performance was as you'd expect basically the same, but it does have a few aces up its sleeve compared to pfSense, including faster updates like I mentioned before and arguably more user friendly interface. And there's a lot more available plugins for adding in additional functionality. Now it's not to say that pfSense is bad. We've been using it for years with pretty much no issues and there's still a larger community behind it. So if you need support or tutorials, you may be better off sticking with pfSense. But in the last few weeks, since we've switched to OPNsense, it's been nothing but great. So I wouldn't hesitate to check it out. If you're looking to build your own router or you're currently on pfSense and you wanna try something else. Just like you should try this segue to our sponsor. Don't worry. You don't have a choice.

You didn't even participate. - That was perfectly good. I don't want it to hurt. - Come on. You got this. - If you guys enjoyed this video, maybe check out... - Center, look at the elbow. There you go! - Maybe check out the first time I did a pfSense build. I managed to kill I think three motherboards. - Was that the first one, the second one, the third, fourth or fifth? - Yeah. I don't know. It was the one where I kept tightening the thing and it turns out it wasn't quite compatible with the bracket thing. And so it would over tighten and break the traces in the board. It was bad. - He knows how to use computers. - I mostly do.",

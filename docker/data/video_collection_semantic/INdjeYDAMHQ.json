    "transcript": "so one of my favorite ultrabooks from last year was the Razer Blade at 13 the specs on this really made it an interesting or capable gaming laptop in a 13 inch form factor it had an NVIDIA MX 130 GPU that was able to push 1080p at medium settings and pretty good frame rates compared to the u HD graphics built in and the agent risk u leik processor was pretty capable of doing a lot of the things as well it's certainly not a performance beast compared to its 15-inch variant which has an RTX GPU and a 6 core processor but honestly for the form factor this thing I mean it was amazing well today Razer is updating their blade stealth 13 line up with some really promising specs so let's take a look at that but first a quick message from our sponsor let me ask you what is more satisfying than a good peel whoo that hits the spot but you gotta love easy to sync a RGB components for a beautiful light show Thermal takes extensive support with 5-volt a RGB motherboard sync gives you lighting control of fans memory lighting kits all the one coolers power supplies and more by using the 5 volt header on your motherboard you can also daisy chain a bunch of products to light from a single 5 volt header or with their own controller for individual customization but now with a RGB sync it's all made incredibly easy to match check it out below so there'll be three models of the new Razer Blade stealth 13 and they're all going to be featuring Intel's latest 10 gen core i7 processor in this case the 1065 g7 and for those of you wondering what that means I've actually done an entire explained video going through Intel's ice Lake lineup and that mess so if you're interested in going through that link will be right over here but either way the 1065 g7 is the second fastest CPU within the ice lake line-up it's right below the 1068 g7 which is a 20 watt TDP processor whereas in this case you're getting a 25 watt TDP CPU and it comes to the base clock of a 1.3 gigahertz boosts up 23.94 course eight threads and on paper that's a lot slower than the 85 65 you risk a liter found on previous gen Razer Blade stealth notebooks but Intel's really banking on Gen 11 graphics baked into these new tangent processors they're supposed to compete against envyus MX 150 GPU unfortunately I can't share any benchmarks with you guys right now because there's an embargo for these new CPUs and the sample that I have over here is a pre-production model so yeah just I'm just gonna have to wait for the full retail models to come out here in the studio and then I'll do a full comparison between the Tenjin CPUs and of course the previous generation stealth to see what the performance differences are we'll definitely go for battery life and other things as well so certainly stay tuned for that now with the implementation of the new gen 11 graphics from Intel it'll be interesting to see how adobe applications can take advantage of those execution units perhaps we could expect faster render times with QuickSync we'll have to find out but the main star of the show is the inclusion of Nvidia's GTX 1650 on these new laptops that's right GTX 1650 on a notebook that's this size I mean that is just incredible now what are some of the sacrifices that Razer had to make in order to cram that GPU into this thin and light form factor well it's only 0.5 millimeters thicker than the previous generation Razer blades tells so that's not really that much also they've added three heat pipes or three additional heat pipes to the notebook for better heat dissipation and that's pretty much it it's refreshing to see Razer push boundaries by implementing a GPU of this caliber in a 13 inch form factor and it's certainly a lot faster than the MX 150 since it offers more CUDA cores higher clock speeds so you should be able to game comfortably at 1080p with medium to high settings now in terms of design there isn't anything different compared to the previous generation so you still get the boxy shape same keyboard layout as well as that glass trackpad which is one of my favorites port selection also remains the same so you get a Thunderbolt 3 port that shares four lanes of PCI Express and other regular 3.1 gen2 type-c port and two USB 3.1 gen2 ports it also features the same battery capacity as well the display is also the same so you get a 13.3 inch 1080p IPS matte screen but if you want you can opt for a 4k touch option but that's definitely gonna cost you an arm and a leg they've added a mercury white bearing this time and that's what I have over here it looks really cool guys and thankfully it won't show finger marks as bad as the black model it also showcases the light reflections in the screen on the chassis and pan it looks gorgeous and it's photogenic as well I still have mixed feelings about the plain white key caps they don't really go well with the solar finish on the notebook and the lighting on the keys are a bit dim compared to the black variant again this could be since I have a pre-production sample over here I would actually leave the lighting disabled but I'm curious to hear your thoughts about that unfortunately if you're looking for a quartz pink limited edition it's not here at least for now but we could expect that later on and it starts at fifteen hundred US dollars it's certainly more expensive than the previous generation stealth laptop and here's a price breakdown between all three models now do keep in mind that the base model only comes in mercury white and it does not have the gtx 1650 GPU and it only has two and fifty six gigabytes of nvme SSD storage if you need that 1650 you're gonna have to pony up an extra $300 and if you need a 4k screen which honestly is pointless in a 13 inch form factor it's $2,000 my friends that Razer tax is pretty damn high so that's pretty much it with the new Razer Blade stealth 13 I can't wait to get my hands on a fully production sample as well as a model that has a 1650 so I can benchmark it and give you guys all the info that you need including battery performance thermal performance that's something that I really am curious to test out especially since it is a solid combo but I'm also curious to test out that Jana lemon GPU as well so a lot of cool content coming your way definitely let me know your thoughts about the new stealth 13 are you guys excited about it of course it is expensive but I really want to hear thoughts about the new stealth notebooks in the comments down below I mean burn with hard-working axe thank you so much for watching make sure to check out certain relevant content over here don't forget to subscribe and hit that notification button wellmy pump out a new video and I'll talk to you guys in the next one",

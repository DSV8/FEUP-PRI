    "transcript": "So it's been a while since we've done one of these. It's a question and answer session. I asked over on Twitter a couple days ago, what questions you have for me, and here are a couple of them. Let's get started. [Intro] So the first question is kind of a weird one...unique I should say. 'What is your parents' daily driver?' My dad is currently using the Galaxy Note 9. And then my mom is using the LG G7. I come from kind of a large family. My older sister is using a One Plus 6T. My brother is using a LG V30. And my younger two sisters are both using iPhones. Right. I'm currently using my two year old Galaxy S8. It's still running like a champ. I'm probably going to keep on using it for a while, I don't really see a need to upgrade. But that might change. Who knows. Two years into the phone...might be time for another one. We'll see what happens. 'What is a recent tech product you regret buying?' So I have a good one. It happened relatively recently. So I ride motorcycles. I've had a bike ever since I was 16. I've been riding for a very long time. And recently I saw an ad for a smart helmet that costs $1,800.00. I was like, alright, the commercial looks good, I'm going to buy it. $1,800.00n later it finally gets here, and it is a complete piece of junk. I am planning on making a full review video about it as soon as the snow melts. But it is an absolute terrible product, and it costs $1,800.00. So I have quite a few things I want to say about it. It's kind of like, you know, just to understand the concept, it's kind of like Google Glass back in 2013....but worse. So buckle up for that video. It's a waste of $1,800.00. 'What phones are you most looking forward to tearing apart in 2019?' And I think we all know the answer to this. Samsung just announced a foldable phone with a very unique hinge system between the two halves. So I'm excited to see how that works. The jury is still out on whether we'll see the insides of the phone during the durability test or during the teardown, but either way, we're going to see the insides of it. 'What is your viewership distribution with different countries?' I think I've gotten this question before, but it's always interesting to see, you know, where traffic is coming from all over YouTube. You know, it's a worldwide platform. And my audience currently is 24% from the United States, 14% from India, and then we have 7% from the UK. And then Indonesia, Philippines, and Canada are right behind them. I do have 10 views from someone over in Liechtenstein in the last 30 days. So...I see you over there! Hope you enjoyed. Thanks for watching! And my female demographics have improved slightly. I'm now at 8%. Probably a little thanks to Cambry on that one. I think most people interested in tech or repairing things usually happen to be males. 'How many times has someone recognized you in public as Zack, the YouTuber?' So I don't get recognized very often as Zack. Usually people think my name is Jerry. I did a different question and answer video about why I chose the name JerryRigEverything for my channel, so I'll link that so you can see what happens there. But usually people are like, 'Oh hey, you're that Jerry...Jerry...You're Jerry!' And I'm like, yeah, I am, and we just kind of roll with it. But I would say, usually when I'm out in public, like maybe 30% of the time, whether I'm at the movies or eating out, someone will stop by and say hi, which I super appreciate. It's always fun to meet someone who likes watching my stuff. 'Do you like pineapple on pizza?' Yes, it's probably my favorite topping. You know, the Hawaiian pizza when you get Canadian bacon and pineapple on there. So good. 'I found your Tacoma videos pretty good. Will you make more in the future?' And yes, I will. Vehicles and, you know, electric vehicles I feel like are the future and I plan on doing more in-depth videos about those, including electric trucks in the future. But I have done a lot of modifications done to the Tacoma that I bought last year. And those are on my second YouTube channel called ZacksJerryRig. Things are quite a bit more chill over there, and that's how we like it. So if you want to see, you know, some of the side projects and things that I've done to my truck...ZacksJerryRig. 'Have you pre-ordered an electric car?' And yes, I have. I have given my refundable thousand dollar deposit on the Rivian electric truck, which should be shipping in 2020. And the specs on this thing and the price are pretty incredible, you know, for what you....you get a lot for what you pay for. Amazon as well just dropped seven hundred million dollars into Rivian, which kind of gives it a little bit of a boost. So I'm pretty confident that they're going to hit the 2020 or 2021 delivery date with their trucks. I'm also following a company named Bollinger, which they have a kind of boxy looking electric truck. A little bit slower. Almost the same price, but they're quite a bit behind schedule with their development. So I think it's pretty much just between Tesla and their unannounced electric truck, versus Rivian. And so we'll see which one comes out on top and which one's better. But I probably will be buying whichever first electric truck comes to market, whether it's Rivian or Tesla, it's probably going to be one of those two. Tesla does have the upper hand with their super charging network, but they haven't announced their truck yet. I might make a video more in-depth on the electric trucks that are in production right now, or are planning on being, you know, in production, but that's where we're at right now. We'll see what happens. 'What is the thing that makes you get up in the morning? Elon Musk has Mars. What about you?' So for context, Elon Musk is the guy who kind of started Tesla. He also has his own rocket company, you know, with the main goal of putting people on Mars. And Elon says he does want to die on Mars someday, just not on impact. That's kind of his life goal. So for me though, what gets me up in the mornings...it's kind of always been I like being productive. I like accomplishing things and helping people. And that's kind of like the theme of my YouTube channel for the last 7 years has been tutorials and like projects I'm doing, and ways that I can help people out, you know, through the internet. Lately, ever since I've made that off-road wheelchair video, I've noticed that, you know, the pricing on accessories and off-road chairs for people who are in wheelchairs is ridiculous. Like, you know, for an off-road wheelchair, it can cost anywhere from $10,000, $20,000, $30,000 and that's just like not sustainable or obtainable to anyone. Whether you're in a chair or not, like that is a lot of money to spend on, you know, something that's not a car. So ever since I built the first off-road for, you know, about $3,000 by combining 2 electric bikes, that's always just kind of been in my mind, and I want to make something on a larger scale that's easier to get in and out of, that's accessible to everyone. So that's been something I've been working on a lot lately. Mass producing something in large quantities takes quite a bit of time, but I think we'll have a complete version by this summer in 2019. So I'm pretty excited about that, and I have a couple other projects in the works as well. [Construction sounds] This is like a proof of concept... ha ha, this is sweet! So that's...that's what's getting me out of bed in the mornings lately. 'Would you ever consider using an iPhone as your daily driver?' So, yeah, the last time that I used an iPhone as my daily driver was back in 2011 I think, with the iPhone 4. I used it for a couple months, and then made a huge long list of things that I didn't like about the iPhone, and then switched back to Android. Then in 2016 I decided to give it another chance. I tried it out for a couple months and it wasn't bad. I didn't die, but it also was not my favorite. It kind of had the exact same list of problems that I had with the iPhone 4 back in the day. To like summarize the experience, I feel like I'm paying a lot of money and not getting the return on my investment when I'm using an iPhone. Granted, I was not using the Apple ecosystem. I didn't have, you know, the watch or the AirPods, or the computers. I was just using the phone. And I think the benefit that comes with the Apple ecosystem is when you're using all of it, but also you're paying a lot of money for that, you know, convenience, which just isn't really worth it to me. You know, my two year old Android phone still has more features than some of the recent iPhones and it's just not worth it. You know, whether you pay $500 or $1,000 for your, you know, smartphone that you're using, the majority of people are just going to run, you know, Facebook, Instagram, and you know, browse the Internet. It's still going to make calls and text messages...it doesn't need to cost as much as it's costing. And I think Apple's wallet has been hit with that for the last year or so, and hopefully we see some changes in the future. But yes, I would consider using an iPhone as my daily driver again, but probably for a short period of time before I go right back to Android for the third time. 'How much did it cost you to start your YouTube channel? And what kind of equipment did you use?' So my first hundred videos or so were all shot with a smartphone. I think the smartphone I had back in the day was the Evo 4G. I don't even think you could film in 1080p, but it was enough to film all the projects I was working on, mostly automotive stuff at that point, you know, doing engine swaps and suspensions and stuff in Jeeps. And then I started to delve more into the cellphone side of things, like repairing smartphones because more people own a smartphone than own a Jeep. And I would just prop the cellphone I was recording with up on a little ledge and film straight down onto the table, do my repair, edit the video and post it. So my first 100 videos were all shot in the first year or so, and I got about 2,000 subscribers that first year. It was fun for me. It was kind of like a side project and more of like a video journal of all my different projects. My current setup is I'm filming with the GH5 in front of me right now. And then I also have a GH5 right here that's kind of mounted to the ceiling with some barn door rails. I have a video on Twitter that's kind of more of a brief tour of my shop that shows like the lights and stuff inside of this room, and how it all works. But yeah, so I'll link that. You can come over and hang out with me on Twitter. If you have any more questions, leave them down in the comments. I'll be hanging down there for about an hour or so and I can just, you know, respond to you right there. And I appreciate it. So yeah, that's kind of a brief summary on where I'm at, and you know, behind the scenes on what I'm doing in, you know, my personal life, and what phones my parents use. Thank you for hitting that subscribe button. Come hang out with me on Twitter and Instagram, and thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.",

    "transcript": "- Is there something inappropriate about what I'm holding right now? (Matt laughing) - Hello and welcome to \"This is.\" We're gonna go through a list of depraved, banned tech. Basically, we're gonna take a look at stuff that has been recalled by the powers that be. I swear to God, if Lawn Darts on here. Lawn Darts! - Did you know that that was gonna be the first item? - No! Lawn Darts shouldn't have been a thing to begin with because it's literally a weighted spear. - The 1980s were a very different time, where you could fly freely through your yard with whatever dangerous implements you wanted. And safety hadn't been invented yet. - I will say that my favorite lawn game is Bocce. It's the ball version of Lawn Darts. It's just weighted ceramic balls that you throw across the lawn. If you get hit in the head with a Bocce ball, you're done. The Turtle Beach XO Four Stealth Gaming Headset. Mold spores were found in the headset. This is literally the prequel to Last of Us. All the gamers rose up and became Clickers. Your gamer's sweat has reactivated the mold. You're the reason that Ellie is-- - No, don't finish the sentence. Don't finish the sentence. - Have you still not finished Last of Us? - Shut up, Matt. - Oh, oh, oh, I got this one. The NZXT H1. I actually did a PC build in this, I wanna say like 2020. It was not that long ago. The reason why this got recalled, and this is actually a fairly big recall, was that the metal screws that attached the PCIe riser assembly to the chassis could short and overheat posing a obvious fire hazard. - You know something about fire hazards? - These were not cheap chassis. I believe this also was the power supply built in too. Like it was a very integratable. - I wanna say it was like $400. - I think they've actually fixed this. And this, I believe, is back on sale now. But this was a cool chassis. Although not great for thermals. 'Cause you might imagine packing this much stuff into a small chassis. - Moving on to the next one. The 15 inch MacBook Pro. - MacBooks have had their fair share of issues over the years. Mostly keyboard related, lately. - [Matt] Yeah, the butterfly keyboards was a big one. - GPU's used to go bad on some of the early 2000 like 10, MacBooks and whatnot. But this one was specific because the batteries inside the MacBooks could overheat and pose a fire hazard. Now I think that these MacBooks were hot enough that they could've posed a fire hazard on their own. - [Matt] But I forgot that this got recalled because these were like swelling up. They were spicy pillows. - They recalled 432,000 of these MacBooks. Roughly the same amount of people who have subscribed to \"This Is.\" Make sure to ring-ling that ding-ling bell so that you'll too be notified when we recall that latest hot video straight to your sub box. - If you text #4222, the letter six. - That effect takes so long to do. (all laughing) Ah crap. - [Austin] Moving on. We have the DEWALT Jobsite Pro Wireless earphones. - These wireless headphones can overheat while charging or in use. So not only do they pose burn and fire hazards, but they also make you go deaf. - That ain't good. - Now I often text you and say, I can't come into work today because I was listening to an absolute fire of a track sea shanty tune. This takes it to a whole new level, where your ears would literally just be. - Yeah, that's actually legitimately scary because when batteries in electronics explode they don't just like puff or whatever. Like they'll actually explode. And I'm sure this is just a white labeled, they just found some random supplier of headphones. They made 'em yellow. They put it in a DEWALT box. And immediately regretted their decision. That's a travesty. (laughing) No, it's not a real product. - It is. - This is not a real product. - No, this is the Husqvarna-na-na. - Husqvarna. - Husqvarna. Like a lot of products I feel during this era had lithium ion battery fire risks. There's no need to mow your lawn if you got no lawn. - And you could get rid of your lawn by burning it to the ground. I heard it's very eco-friendly, you save water. - Back when I lived in New York and owned a house, my neighbor had one of these robots. These things were so goddamn dumb. I would sit there and watch my neighbor's take off. And it would take all day because the batteries in them were so small. It would do like three lines of the lawn and have to go charge for a little while. 1,400 units were recalled. And you know what? - That's how many people subscribed to \"This Is\" this morning. It's incredible! - I think we're about to have a subscriber recall. - It's actually impossible to unsubscribe. Don't test that. - MixBin iPhone. - Oh! I've seen these before. Okay, so these are like those cases that are actually filled with liquid and like glitter. So you can shake it up and it's like a little snow globe in your phone case. Apparently liquid and glitter can leak out of the cases causing skin irritation and burns to consumers. What liquid is there, are they putting in there that's gonna burn you? - At no point during that rollercoaster ride of an explanation did I know what was gonna happen next. I thought, okay, these are maybe leaking. Causing a mess, staining everything, whatever. That's enough to me to recall it. But to burn? - How is this not just water and glitter? - But what's the glitter made out of, pure mercury? - Bits of... - Uranium? - Craft paper. These were really popular in that sort of like 2015 teenager. - Every basic who was getting a Starbucks at a Target was. - Wow! Matt you just, you had a Starbucks in your hand like 10 minutes ago. Moving thankfully on, we have the Boosted Board. Now the Boosted Board company is, I believe, out of business now, correct? - Yes. Well, because the only person who bought any of them was Casey Neistat. - Also had one. - Yeah. I mean, if you didn't live in New York City, the Boosted Board just didn't make sense. - Again, this is that sort of period in the mid to late 2010s where tons of lithium ion batteries through various reasons, whether it was manufacturing, whether it was build, whether it's just they got too hot or whatever, were catching on fire. And all it took us one viral video of someone on a Boosted Board, which catches on fire. And everyone goes, oh shoot, I don't wanna spend $2,000 on a stupid skateboard that Casey Neistat told me to buy when it's gonna catch on fire. Matt, would you just say that instead of skate or die, it's skate and die. I didn't really deliver that joke in the way that I think it was written. Aaron, can you please tell the joke the correct way - You've heard of skate or die, but what about skate and die? (both laughing) - [Matt] Moving on. Every hoverboard ever. - Do we even have to explain this one? - Copy and paste what we just said about the last three items. - Hoverboards became so popular because I think there was like one company who made the proper one and then everyone knocked it off. And they were literally everywhere through 2015, 2016. - Half the time, these things would go in reverse and smash you into a wall. - I once won a hoverboard race against MKBHD. That's what's gonna be printed on my tombstone. - I refuse to believe that these were recalled because they were dangerous. They were. I think these were recalled because humanity knew that it had gone too far. - Me as a almost 30 year old man-child has a great time on a hoverboard. Me as an actual child, would've been literally the most excited in the world to have a hoverboard to ride around on, and eventually crack my skull on. I mean, what more could you ask for out of a childhood? - [Matt] The Black and Decker under the cabinet coffee maker. - [Austin] Wait, is this a thing, Matt? - The coffee pot handle can break off causing the pot to fail. - Oh! - Now I've heard of coffee grounds, but this is ridiculous. You're eating a PBJ, and then it just breaks off, and just smashes your hand. - Hot coffee everywhere, glass shards everywhere. - Have you ever seen this in real life? - There's gonna be like tons of people in the comments that are like, this is like my favorite coffee maker. - I've had my Black and Decker under the cabinet coffee maker since 1982. And I use my hoverboard to get my morning coffee in the morning, and I go and grab that. And then I play Lawn Darts with my kids. Illuminated mirrors, wait. - No, from Restoration Hardware. The reason for this was that loose components in the mirrors' bulb sockets could lead to overheating, posing, surprise, surprise, fire and shock hazards. - But with the Restoration Hardware illuminated mirror you looked shockingly good. (all clapping and cheering) Heyday. - [Austin] We just did the Target Tech video. - We just did this. Check out all of our other stuff we did for the Heyday brand at our Target Tech. You could catch that right over here. - We also didn't burn anything down so that was a plus. - Have you ever gone to plug-in a charger, and you're kind of feeling around with your fingers 'cause you can't see where to plug it in. - Plug my fingers straight in. - And yeah, you're kind of holding the plug while plugging in the outlet, and electrocute yourself? I attribute that to why I am the way I am. - I call that a fun Saturday night. - [Matt] Monoprice cat 6 e-- How do you mess up cat 6? - The cables do not meet the flammability requirements of the voluntary safety standard, posing a fire hazard. - When you're buying thousand foot of cable, like this, it means you're running it throughout the building. That's sitting over duct work, it's sitting over electrical conduit. It's literally a fuse. - Well, so here's the thing. - If it catches on fire, it goes like-- You shouldn't run a cable and rest it on a heat duct. - You're not supposed to? I did that. - Yeah, that's why your house burned down. Like and subscribe for when we have It's All Gone part six. Fallout 76 helmet. - No, it's another mold. - Another mold! - What's with all the mold, Matt? - Because gamers don't shower. We're too busy rising up. Mold can be present on the fabric inserted inside the helmet, posing a risk of respiratory or other infections. This also came with a canvas bag that was made of plastic. I remember this one was a massive scandal because they didn't make enough. And this was a pretty pricey. - [Austin] It was a collectors edition for Fallout 76. - Gamers, shower. I'm gonna get so many hate comments. Gamers don't compromise. That's why we don't use deodorant. Moving on to the next item, is the Matrix T1 and T3 treadmills. The treadmill can turn on unexpectedly. So when you put all your laundry on that treadmill, 'cause let's face it, you ain't using it, it posed a risk for an injury. With all those bars, Look how many more shirts you can hang off of that thing. - How dare you? - This is basically a wardrobe. - I think that this product should be recalled because the outside is better than a treadmill. Go touch some grass. Better for ya. - Go touch grass. And there's no mold out there. - Well actually, there's a lot of mold. Actually, don't go outside. - There's not in your, it's not in your headgear. - Are we done with this video? How many more items are there? - How many items-- - Say moving on. - [Both] Moving on! - Oh good Lord. Oh no, no, no, no, no. The Sakar Bluetooth speaker multipurpose helmets. Are those eye holes? - No. - Those look like eye holes. - It's mold holes. The helmets do not comply with the US federal safety standard for bicycle helmets. But here's the thing. It's a helmet that doesn't protect your head. That's literally the one thing it's supposed to do. - It makes you look cool, Matt. It looks cool. - It's not, you're not Batman in this thing. - If you dont't put that over your eyes what's the point of buying this helmet? - You don't put it over your eyes, dude. - 89,000 units were recalled. The amount of people who just unsubscribed because of my dumb joke. - [Matt] The DEWALT, DEWALT again! - [Austin] No, no, no, no, no, no. An 18 inch corded chainsaw. - But here's the thing. It's not for the reason you think. The chainsaw can remain running when the switch is in the on or the off position. We're gonna chop this one off, I don't know. (both rumbling) - [Austin] What, school supply crayons? - [Matt] Discount school supply crayons. The red crayons contained glass, posing a laceration hazard to the user. - Excuse me, I thought the dangerous part of crayons was eating them, or sticking them in your nose. Not having glass. I've been doing crayons wrong my entire life. - Did they not know how to make a red crayon? - They threw some glass in there. - They put a little glass in there. So that way you, the red, you were just bleeding on the paper. - Moving on. We've got... - [Matt] Cracker Barrel! - Cracker Barrel old country decorative pineapples. The leaves on the top of the pineapples have sharp edges leading to a laceration hazard. These are, this is safe, this is fine. - Turns out the real reason that these decorative pineapples got recalled is people kept flipping 'em upside down. - Is this some inappropriate thing? - Like four people in the comments are gonna get that joke. - Is there something inappropriate about what I'm holding right now? - Ask your parents and also your friend's parents. (both laughing) - Like, subscribe, follow, and let us know what other products you want us to look that were banned. In the meantime, we're gonna be flipping pineapples. - No, we're not. - We're gonna be using some DEWALT headphones. - Nope. - To listen to some absolute fire tracks. (dynamic music)",

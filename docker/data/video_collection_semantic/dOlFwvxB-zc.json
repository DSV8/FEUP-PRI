    "transcript": "it seems to me that the technology in these boxes is a big reason why HPE spent about $14 billion I screw buying Juniper Networks HPE to acquire Juniper Networks to accelerate AI driven Innovation Mist was purchased by Juniper in 2019 for $405 million there's a good reason why Juniper spent the money buying Mist and extending the capability in the last few years and why HPE have purchased Juniper now now I'm not always a fan of these but there's something to be said if Juniper for the fourth time in a row is a leader in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Enterprise wide and wireless infrastructure notice Magic Quadrant, notice where Juniper is, notice where HPE is. Aruba Networks so that's now being combined so it's going to be interesting to see how this changes in the coming years but that's enough talking in this video I want to show you how to get started with the Mist APS okay let's get started and show you the power of the AI running in the Mist infrastructure want to show you how to use Marvis to troubleshoot various issues let's see how easy it is to set up a missed AP and troubleshoot network issues and also see the capabilities of this product but before we get started I want to thank Juniper for sponsoring this video and supporting my channel okay so in this example I've got two Juniper APs these are AP 45s the unboxing experience isn't really much I mean very basic these days we've got installation guides and Technical documentation at supportmist.com basically just comes in with a plastic very basic not really much of an unboxing experience once again and we've got the wall mounting kit so that's basically it for the unboxing but notice a Juniper access point driven by Mist AI at the back here we've got a barcode that we can scan to claim the AP this AP needs to be powered with PoE now Juniper tell me that I don't need a Juniper infrastructure to take advantage of these access points and the Mist AI so what I've got here is a UniFi switch providing PoE and ethernet connectivity so I'll be able to use this port ethernet0 plus PoE and then power the switch but notice here we've got a claim code which allows me to claim this access point and register it with the portal so what I'll do firstly is go to manage.mist.com and what I'll do here is create an account so you need an organization setup before you can register your access points so I'm going to go and register in the near region where I am in the UK I'm going to put in my name and my surname I'll put in my email address and I'll specify a password and create an account. We're told that we need to confirm our email and then we'll be able to log in so I'll validate that on my phone and now I'll be able to log in so the first thing we need to do is create an organization before we register to the access point so I'll just give this a name Okay so we've got our primary site set up we've got our organization set up so what I'll do now is use my phone to scan that code and get the access point registered so I'll go to the Play Store and I'm going to search for Mist AI and then I'm going to press install to install the app and there you go I need to open it and now I need to put in my email address again after put in my password the environment I'm going to be using is in the EU so I'm going to press login I need to select my organization I only have one so I'll select that the side is going to be the primary site so going back I'm going to claim devices to the organization and what I'll do is allow it to access the QR code and you can see it says successful AP was successfully claimed so I'm going to say done and then all I'm going to do now is plug in the power to the AP hopefully this will power up you can see booting after a while it'll hopefully register now before I continue notice the power requirements for this access point it requires 802.3bt power for full functionality on 802.3at PoE it can dynamically function based on the configuration to provide full wireless functionality the AP requests 29.3 watts of power so you either need to have a switch that provides that amount of power to the access point or you need to use a PoE injector. So back in the portal now going to access points notice we told that there are no APs found in the site but if I click on inventory I can see this access point and I can see that it's unassigned so I'm going to click more assign to site I'm going to assign it to the primary site and click close it says currently disconnected if I click on the access point I can give it a name let's call it AP45_1 now I'll click save at the moment because there are a lot of options that can be configured here and you can see the access point is now connected so let's go to Radio management for site settings you can see 5 GHz radio is enabled so that's good if I go back and I'll look at the radio configuration for 6 GHz you can see that that access point is connected and the radio is enabled so I'm going to go to site WLANs because I need to set up Wi-Fi network so I'm going to say add new WLAN so let's call this DemoWiFi_1 one have to put in a password here now for security I could use WPA3 or WPA2 I could use 802.1x in this example I'll just use PSK many options available here including setting the VLAN is untagged or tagged etc but I simply want to get a basic Wi-Fi network setup so I'll click create and then on my phone let's have a look at the Wi-Fi networks so I'll go to settings connections Wi-Fi and we can see that Network demo Wi-Fi 1 I'll put in my password press connect and notice I'm connected to the Wi-Fi network so on my browser I'll go to Juniper Networks and notice right on the homepage it tells us about the HPE Juniper acquisition and it also talks about the AI native now event series and notice who's right on the front page one of the founders of Mist AI now going to clients Wi-Fi clients I can see the device name IP address Mac address can see the SSID being used if I click on the device I can see receive physical, rate transmit physical rate, can see information about data that's been sent whole bunch of information just available with this very basic setup but I could also go to client insights and then I can see a lot more information so I'll zoom in a bit here we can see DNS was successful, Gateway ARP was successful, DHCP was successful authorization and Association was successful we can see the VLAN the client belongs to, we can see the DNS server and I'll just zoom out there notice DNS server 192.168.0.1 we can see the band that the phone is connected via so 2.4 GHz which channel it's using so just with this very basic setup I can see Wi-Fi information Network information I can also see where the device went so went to Netflix and that's because on this phone I've been doing a speed test by going to fast.com now the network that I'm using here isn't very fast it's only you can see it's about 80 megabits per second that's got nothing to do with the Mist configuration that's got to do with the physical Network here but notice I can see all that information directly through the portal so going to Marvis Marvis actions at the moment no actions are shown there's no bad cables as an example there no issues with the network but this was a very basic setup let's make it more interesting and let's introduce some [Music] troubleshooting now in a lot of demonstrations it looks really easy to get devices registered and everything works perfectly that may not be the case when you setting this up so let's troubleshoot some issues that you may encounter some of these issues we actually encountered ourselves so this first example example is a real world example that we had when we initially set this up Dawid who's on my team and based in South Africa was having problems where some devices couldn't see the Wi-Fi network so he configured the access points he configured the Wi-Fi networks but nothing seemed to be working his clients couldn't see the Wi-Fi network now this is what I really like about the Juniper Mist system it's a central portal that allows you to manage many many sites you don't have to be local to help troubleshoot an issue or sort out an issue so in my example I've got two Juniper access points set up everything looks good here both showing green but are they actually working in the way that we think they are working so under access points you can immediately see that there's a problem we're told warning two access points have reduced functionality if I look at the second access point and scroll down we're told immediately that there's a problem with power and notice here power source is 802.3af only 2.4 GHz is available here using one by one that's a really poor usage of a very powerful access point notice we're told disable 5 GHz and 6 GHz so in the practical demonstration that Dawid was setting up what happened was only 5 GHz was available not 2.4 GHz so no 2.4 GHz clients could see the Wi-Fi network because it had been disabled because there isn't enough power looking at his specific access point notice here this access point AP34 requires 802.3at power for full function it you can use 802.3af power to connect to the Mist cLoud but you'll see a warning message saying that the power is insufficient in my example using the AP45 which I have two of here once again this also requires 802.3bt for full functionality really important that you check the power that the access points are receiving on the Juniper website we told that PoE was first defined in IEEE 802.3af which supplied up to 15 watts of power to a connected power device so that's the power at the switch or PoE injector. Now Juniper have done extensions to that but IEEE 802.3at or PoE plus supplies up to 30 watts of power and then there's a Juniper extension supplying power up to 90 Watts but again the standard 802.3bt or PoE BT supplies up to 90 watts of power so on Wikipedia as an example we can see power delivered by the PSE or power available at the Powered Device or PD so 802.3af 15.4 Watts 802.3at or PoE plus 30 watts and then notice 802.3bt type 3 is 60 watts and then 802.3bt type 4 PoE++ is 90 watts so you need to be careful these two are shown as PoE++ but we've got 60 watts and 90 watts so going back to the Juniper system on the other access point so access point one what's nice here is we can actually see the device that's providing the power so USW-Lite-16 PoE little switch at the top here we can also see that there's a degradation in performance because this is only providing power at 802.3at levels so we do get 2.4 GHz 5 G GHz and 6 GHz which is much better than the Cisco example which is only providing 802.3af levels of power so in this example again we only get 2.4 GHz or like in another example we only get 5 GHz there's not enough power to power all the antennas so we're only getting one by one as an example and we can't use all the bands so very very quickly we were able to troubleshoot an issue with the network not performing as it should so either not all antennas are being powered again fantastic access points but if you don't give them enough power they're not going to operate as well as they should he's telling the [Music] truth okay so let's try a power injector and look at some issues with power injectors so I'll disconnect the access point from the Cisco switch and plug it into this UniFi power injector little power injector like this is not going to work very well because there's not enough power once again just like an older switch like this I'm not using this switch at the moment this UniFi switch provides the full amount of power required but I wanted to show you some issues using different types of devices with the Juniper system okay so access point is now connected to the missed system let's have a look at access point 2 still complaining about power issues so scrolling down we can see that it's now showing that it's actually connected to the USW switch not actually connected directly it's connected via this black cable to the UniFi switch but it's actually using power injector here and we've actually made things worse because this is now PoE 802.3af and only 2.4 GHz is now available whereas before we were getting more power so if we look at access point one notice it's getting 802.3at connected directly to the UniFi switch so be careful with your power I think that's enough talking about power we can also see here that some of the access points are not using the order upgrade version so access point 2 needs to be upgraded so going back here we can see expected version is this one ending in 139 so if I click on that go to utilities upgrade firmware how about an upgrade proceed I'm going to select that version and click Start upgrade and you can see the access point is being upgraded again very nice interface is here showing you what's happening in the network let's have a look at some more basic troubleshooting issues it's difficult to simulate troubleshooting in a small environment like this so in a moment I'll jump into a demo environment that Juniper has that gives you a much better topology than just say two access points like I've got here obviously this is not a very good way to position your access points right next to each other that's obviously only because of the video here but as you can see here upgrading is almost at 100% okay so there you go version compliance is 100% we you can see at the top here we've got two access points two AP45s connection status is 100% VLAN's 100% version compliance is 100% but let's see what happens if we unplug this cable so the access point is still powered by the power injector but I've disconnected the power injector connection to the UniFi switch so what we should notice is one of the access points is disconnected okay refreshing the portal notice we can see no ethernet link has no link seen using power injectors but not connected to switch okay that's really impressive that I was able to work that out if I click on no ethernet link We to the AP status and we can look at the LEDs here to see what's going on so notice there it blinked twice so Amber or yellow if you prefer that tells us here no ethernet link has no link seen using power injectors but not connected to a switch now many LEDs are shown here telling you what's going on so as an example insufficient PoE blue tells us that at least one Wireless client is connected so as an example notice this client has just connected to this access point so now it's showing blue so very nice that we've got RGB access points here showing us the status of what's happening so a whole bunch of options available here if I connect that cable in and I'm not using a very good cable here but I just wanted to see what it would do with a not so great cable notice now it's connected back so hopefully after a while this will sort itself out and connect back to the Juniper Mist system okay we can see that this is now gone green so no client connected to this access point but there is at least one client connected to this access point and there you go notice it now showing connected so both access points are connected we've now got 100% connection status so it's very nice to see how the Juniper Mist system makes it easy to troubleshoot Wi-Fi issues okay but let's look at authentication problems if I go to monitor service levels and scroll down notice side events here this access point was unable to reach the Mist Cloud we saw rebooting happening saw some issues here we can see a pixel phone connected to the network so there was DNS success, ARP success, DHCP success authorization and Association success but notice previously we had an issue with that phone and this pixel 8 phone so if I zoom out a little bit here pixel 8 Pro connected to AP45_1 using this wi-fi network so demo Wi-Fi 2.4 GHz WPA2 using 802.11ax was having an issue and we're told right away what the problem is previous authentication no longer valid so there's a PSK mismatch so authentication type is PSK and what I really like here is I can download a Wireshark capture so pcap file and open that up and see what's going on so a client device was having a problem connecting to the network what's fantastic here is at the time that problem happened we got a log of what the issue is and a Wireshark capture rather than trying to ask the user what was going on we have data telling us what the problem was at that time so again really really cool that you can do this we can see here that the client tried to connect to the Mist system so we've got an authentication message here the Mist system is sending an authentication message back to the client we've got the client trying to associate there's a response from the Mist AP and notice here the Mist AP is initiating the WPA four-way handshake so we've got message 104 client is responding so message two of four and then it just seems to continue doing that we've got message 104 204 etc and then we've got a deauthentication message from the Mist system and the client is deassociated and you I mean you can dig into the details here of what's going on the access point is challenging the client authentication message the client is sending back WPA2 authentication so notice here we can see the data the actual WPA key and then the client authentication fails so what I really like about this is the access point is capturing this traffic this is not from the client's point of view this is from the access Point's point of view the capture is done at the time when there was a problem what you know if you've been involved in troubleshooting is really hard to troubleshoot transient issues try and replicate them or try and get proper information out of a user who's not technical as an example so at the time when there was a problem pcap was captured I can open that in Wireshark I don't have to rely on a user trying to explain to me what the problem is I can see what happened at the time when it happened rather than trying to wait for it to happen again and then be online when it actually takes place this is obviously a very simple example but hopefully shows you the power of the system notice here we've got an SAE authentication failure so this is WPA version 3 rather than version 2 so SAE is being used here if I download that pcap file notice here we see authentication issues between the access point and the client obviously very different to WPA2 we don't see the four-way handshake like we saw in WPA2 but again we're told through a summary here that there's an SAE authentication failure so there's probably a misconfigured password and if we go to our wireless LANs go and look at that WPA3 Network as an example we'll be able to see personal SAE configuration here and be able to look at the password so I won't r reveal the password here but if you click on reveal it'll show you the password that's being used in this case psk rather than 802.1ax Radio Service so Enterprise authentication it's just a simple psk but I could see the password and then make sure that the client is using the correct password for this wi-fi network now that's one way to troubleshoot but a lot of us these days are interacting with AI and one of the big selling points of Juniper Mist is Marvis so I'll click on the AI icon here so this is Marvis and it says hello David I'm Marvis your virtual Network assistant here are some options to get started but what I'll simply prompt this is which wi-fi clients are having issues and we can see here straight away that this Galaxy s22 Ultra is having a problem so I clicked on it and by doing that it says troubleshoot the issue and we're told immediately there is an issue with an incorrect password we're told that the client is failing 100% of the time on this wi-fi network this is only impacting a small number of clients I mean this is a very small Network we could look at the failure timeline as an example and notice we can see here successful connects authorization issues and we can look through a timeline to find out when the problems took place we can see a correlation so the problem is on this access point this is the Wi-Fi network causing the problem and in summary once again 100% of attempts failed we could also look at the scope of the impact and we can see once again that it's only affecting this network and if we look at client insights we can see authorization failure deauthentication from the access point authorization failure deauthentication from the access point so again this is a very small Network my Brave browser that I'm using here has inverted some of the colors so that's why we're not seeing all the prettiness that you would see if you weren't using Brave like I am here I'm foring everything to run in dark mode so the graph would be prettier in your example than what I'm seeing here but notice how easy it was to interact with the AI and troubleshoot a Wi-Fi issue so using light mode as an example I go to Marvis let's troubleshoot what do we want to troubleshoot let's say a device can you tell me something about the device so so rather than trying to find out the MAC address I'm just going to say Samsung phone and notice it's told me that it's found this device here and this device here so if I click on the first one I can see client insights for that device so again we can see the SAE authentication failures we can down load the packet captures but if I go to monitor service levels and scroll down notice I'll be able to see as an example the access points I'll be able to see how long they've been online I'll be able to see where they connect it in the network and I can see as an example the wired switch being used is a UniFi switch it's nice to have access points like these but you don't need them to test the Mist AI system Juniper have created this Mist AI test drive platform that you can use where you can experience the AI native networking difference yourself use my link below to sign up you need to fill in some of your details and then you get access to a live demo this is a lot more real world than me just having two access points under Marvis Marvis actions we can see that there are 114 actions this is the place that you would start your troubleshooting each day so as an example we can see that there's a layer one problem in this network there's a bad cable and we're told exactly where the problem is Port gigabit 1/0/19 on the corporate switch 1 has a bad cable notice the recommended action these devices have a bad cable connected to one or more ports for Mist APs and switches test and replace the cable for WAN edges look at the documentation and they give us a link to documentation to help troubleshoot bad cables so this really makes troubleshooting a lot easier rather than running around trying to find issues in a network notice we see two other actions here persistently failing clients scrolling down we can see 802.1x or failure we can click view more to see more information so this unknown client is persistently failing authentication that may be a problem with someone trying to attack your network or some other related issue let's look at connectivity issues authentication failures scrolling down we can see various authentication failures so as an example on the corporate Wi-Fi network we can see a nice graph of failures on the network we can see that a majority of failures are due to specifically IEEE 802.1x authentication failures clicking on AP we can see affected access points now as the joke goes it's always DNS so under actions connectivity we can see DNS failures scrolling down we can see problems with a specific DNS server so there are failing DNS queries here affecting various Wi-Fi networks so as an example all WLANs are failing now let's look at APs so we can see which APs are offline in an environment so various Access Points are offline so under actions let's go to Access Points and look at coverage holes we can see that the following Access Points noticed frequent coverage issues around them please reposition or add more Access Points in order to provide adequate coverage very nice that it shows this so this is the site this is the Access Point it affects the 5 GHz Network and clicking more we can actually see where the problem is on our map so on our map we can see exactly areas that don't have enough Access Points all the Access Points are incorrectly positioned let's look at insufficient capacity the following Access Points have reduced capacity please check corresponding reasons to improve the capacity so we can click on capacity looks like there's a problem with a third party switch in this network looking at switches issues that a lot of us may encounter and struggle to troubleshoot missing VLANs VLANs are missing on these devices so two Access Points missing VLANs and we're told exactly which Access Points are affected so Access Points and switch and which VLANs are missing on a specific Port so on this port VLANs are missing and on this third party switch VLANs are missing very difficult to troubleshoot that sometimes on this access point VLAN 2 is missing what about a negotiation mismatch detected so spanning tree may not be configured correctly on the WAN we might have a bad Wan Uplink so on this side in Seattle there's a ISP dhp failure on this site in Salt Lake City there is a per LTE signal strength so we can see latency and Jitter aren't great so we can see here as an example that there's a poor signal strength observed for 80% of the time between those two dates 65% latency 35% Jitter on that link so other options include troubleshooting clients data center applications security and so forth what's really nice is if you start your day hopefully there'll be no actions here which means that the network is good but if there are actions if there are problems you are notified about those problems and you are told where the problems are in the network one of the hardest things to do with troubleshooting is to find where the problem actually is what is actually causing the problem and once you find it then often times it's quite easy to resolve but trying to nail down the problem takes a lot of time and generally a lot of experience this makes the process so much easier and is a great example of actually using Artificial Intelligence to do something useful to help network Engineers better manage and troubleshoot networks notice AI is validating issues VPN path down at Salt Lake City so on the right hand side we see messages validated by the AI to help us better troubleshoot the network so here we've got missing VLAN here we've got authentication failure and you can change the actions to either show today or yesterday or the last seven days as an example so as previously demonstrated you could use Marvis and troubleshoot network issues or use Chat GPT type questions to ask about problems in the network to help you troubleshoot but these Marvis actions make it very very simple to find problems in the network okay big shout out to Juniper once again for sponsoring this video and sending me some Access Points to test hopefully you enjoyed this video and learned something please let me know if you have any questions what's your experience of the Juniper Mist system how do you think it compares to say other vendors out there please put your comments below I'm David Bombal and I want to wish you all the very best [Music]",

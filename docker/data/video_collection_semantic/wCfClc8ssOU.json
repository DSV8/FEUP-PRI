    "transcript": "So I think that this is the most expensive thing I've ever had on a desk here At Unbox Therapy Now, If you some sort of Unbox Therapy aficionado You can go back through the Inventory and you can tell me if there is something I missed But I don't think anything is gonna beat this This, my friends is the $20,000 smartphone *Flabbergasted and grabs his cap* It is from a company called Sirin Labs And the phone is called The Solarin We are dealing with a very fine piece of machinery There is gold involved Maybe even diamonds and leather And all the wonderful materials that exist on this planet are apparently inside this box And a part of this phone so; Green emblem on the front Whoo-oo! Thats $20,000 dollar green Anticipation here, holy smokes Okay Whoohoho Woah Is that carbon fiber? And the gold on the outside Holy smokes Conor Mcgregor he needs one of these Get the phone you get to go with the Bentley. On the back here I can see the camera I also see this little switch on the top Apparently, you switch this over to security mode and immediately all of your communications are encrypted Because remember You are crazy wealthy If you are walking around with a $20,000 phone USB-C port. Looks like it Speakers on the front? It looks like forward facing, finally. A headphone jack as well Cause' this looks like a door This; this must be it here the little SIM tool goes on your keychain Also carbon Fiber Top secret. Secret Agent style. So takes the Nano SIM. Install in there Slide it up Where the SIM card tray goes. This becomes your volume rocker as well. Now also in here Look at the way Look at the way they did the unboxing experience. USB-C to old school USB or or you have USB-C to USB-C Here is the power brick. North American prongs, perfect for me The international adapters as well look at that They were telling me that with this phone you have any kind of issue They are actually flying a guy out from head office If they can't fix immediately you are getting a loaner phone It's incredible ooh. Solarin Privacy guide From the moment your phone is switched on State of the art cyber security software is protecting your privacy of all your communications While you are using your phone Solarin is Inspecting and analyzing the behavior of websites and applications Continuously monitoring the operating system and communication networks Suspicious activities are analyzed in real-time by a dedicated team of experts in an undisclosed control center Holy smokes When the security shield is on All non-secure incoming phone calls and texts are blocked Wow that is some next level, that's some CIA stuff right there and you can invite family members and friends and business associate So that person then receives a link and then can download an app on android or ios. to participate in this incredibly secretive exchange Special hardware on your phone authenticates the identity of the communication to 256 bits AES End to End encryption The encryption idea here is that imagine that your message or your phone call Is inside of a container , on the other end when it gets to other individual It is packed out of that container and in the meantime as it is moving across if it were to be intercepted , the person trying to get in there couldnt open that container Ooo-oohh An included Headset Interchangeable Ear-tips Those are actually pretty nice looking It doesn't necessarily have to be for everyone , there are plenty of phones that are out there For Everyone! This is a special thing on the fancy end of the spectrum Are you ready. Oooh Okay! Lets setup the fingerprint. Ooh! We are in! We've got a custon launcher on there Let's test out the camera. It says 17.8 Megapixels Lets get that thumbs up Tom! There it is. Not bad! You, Looking at me Looking at you. Now the selfie camera, this is 8 Megapixels. Look at that beard, I'm looking like Santa Claus these days Now there's also some HDR settings and Video settings as well Phone: Video clip test Phone: Testing the video on the $20,000 Solarin phone This fall! Cinema event you've been waiting for What happens when when I switch this on? \"You have just turned on Solarin security shield\" It's got a whole different look to it. Woah... So you just... you go ahead... this is were you put in the people that are... approved Its like a phone icon, and a text icon, and that seems like thats it Like... your the president or whatever, and, and you got to like... you gotta go down to the basic communication level Your not playing angry birds Independence day! There's no time for angry birds! You flip the switch, and its calls and texts With the people who are approved to be there, to do so. People probably try to call me right now Guess what they're getting? A message telling them they're second class citizens We go back to a regular looking android phone, and... all of a sudden, Its code red Boom! Matrix mode You heard about all the news, you know, the NSA, who's spying on who. Who's doing doing what. Who's leaking what Jacks telling me right now he feels less secure just seeing this matrix mode right here. Man's got an iphone in his pocket, those photos will put this man in jail This is like the CIA type communication for a regular person, and do you have 20 Grand to spend on a phone? No, maybe you don't This is the rolls royce right here. With the picture on your wall, your a kid right now and you know one day your going to say, alright, I need that Its my time to shine That's real gold, my friends I don't know, could this thing take a bullet? Probably. Did I officially clear that with the legal team I did not *Music* Ooh... *Music* Ooh! *Music* Uh huh... Yes, you were saying... *Loud Music* Who was the phone for? I think you guys know, its for big wigs. You know... Its for dudes who got a lot of cash, I mean, I just got to say it! That's who its for. Exclusivity, you know. Exclusivity comes at a price. It always does. Your going to have the margins associated with luxury, it costs you more to fly in a private jet, you know this stuff. Let me tell you something... The world of absolute luxury is completely crazy, and that's why its cool",

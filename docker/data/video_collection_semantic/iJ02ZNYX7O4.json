    "transcript": "- The new kids on the block have bestowed upon us a brand new printer. Thanks to Bambu Lab for sponsoring today's video, and sending us their brand new P1P. This one, is a new version, a stripped down version of their X1 and X1 Carbon, at over half the price of their X1 Carbon. Let's see if they cut the corners in the right places. Compared to the X1 Carbon, and the X1, this has no side panels. It really is a skeletonized version. It looks exactly like the X1 Carbon, sort of on the inside, almost all of this is exactly the same. It uses the exact same motion platform as their top of the line models. So, that's kind of where most of the cost is, and then they basically just got rid of all the extra stuff that you don't really need. So, we have a entire spool of Bambu Labs basic filament. This will be the screen. So, I don't believe this is a touch screen. It's kind of just a little guy like this, with a chromatic, kind of boring thing. We'll get that installed in a minute. The kind of design methodology of this one, more like, \"Ooh, you can customize it, make it your own.\" So, if you want to upgrade it down the line, or use the printer itself to print new panels, those are all available as generic items online. You can buy these accessories for the P1P, if you so want. We have a nozzle cleaning needle, very small. We have a little Allen Key, for some of the bolts that we're gonna be removing in a minute. I believe this is going to be the main Allen Key that we'll be using for all of the shipping bolts at the bottom, there. I guess some extra little screws for the hot end assembly. We also have a couple of replacement parts for the nozzle wiping system. These are kind of interesting, because this printer has an entire system of pre-checks before you start printing. So, it makes it incredibly easy to just kind of... Push go and everything's all right, including the filament cutter system and everything like that. And then, we have the hot end itself. They give you an entire new hot end as a spare, which is really quite nice. You may have noticed that the hot end is not like anything else on the market, and it is completely proprietary. That kind of raises my heckles a little bit, it's nice that they've included another one, but you can buy replacement hot ends from Bambu for the absolutely horrendous price of 15 dollars. So, if it's going to be proprietary, I'm glad it's kind of that price. It's really quite nice to see. Bambu is saying it'll take fifteen minutes from unboxing to first print, and pretty much the whole printer comes fully assembled. We do have to remove a couple screws that hold the bed down for shipping. And then, we also have to put on the screen. You take the screen, and you plug the cable into the screen. So, that tucks in there, and then it just snaps over, and the screen's on. I've got the all metal filament spool holder attached. We can see our belts directly. It apparently has an automatic belt tension system, I have no idea how that works, I've never seen it in action, I assume it just does it automagically in the background. And, something that we don't often see on 3D printers, is it's got a butt, it has a little poop shoot. When we get it started up, I'll show you. But, it primes and poops it out the back. Here we go. So, we can actually look inside the hot end assembly's just held on with magnets. And yeah, we just gotta get this PTFE tube in here, and we press that in, make sure it's locked in nice and tight. There we go. And, that's pretty much that. Okay, first power on, this is always exciting. Ope. That's what our first bit of hurdle, and a bit of gripe with Bambu. We need an app. Now, I understand that that's sometimes kind of okay. I think in this instance it is. I like that they've included a skip this portion. You really just have to use it once, we have an account. And, what we're gonna do, is we'll just scan the barcode and then have it bound to our account. We're gonna do our first time setup, now. We can see in the app, here, it's asking me again if I removed those bolts. If you do forget, it doesn't destroy itself, it just makes horrible, horrible noises. So, don't forget that. And, it's asking me to start the procedure. I'm gonna hit start. Oh yeah, another thing I really like about these, is the ZED Gantry moves really quickly. This is it's homing procedure, and then it'll go to the middle. The bed will vibrate, which is kind of interesting. It has a vibration dampening compensation system. There's a sensor in the hot end, or somewhere in the printer that measures the vibration coming from the machine itself, and kind of adjusts the motion paths to cancel that out, or at least make it a little bit more minimal. The bed kind of vibrates, just to make sure that there's nothing in the way. If I put my hand on it, it'll basically throw an error and be like, \"Oh, the bed's hit something and I'm not supposed to have hit something yet.\" There's no homing switch on this. The homing is done completely through the nozzle and hot end assembly. Which is amazing. It means that your always gonna have perfectly level prints, that don't need any fine tuning to get that first layer right. Because it knows that the nozzle is at 0, rather than it being an offset from your end stop, compared to the bed, compared to the nozzle. Now, we've started our vibration compensation. So, it's going to sweep through different levels of intensities of vibratory-ness, and measure them compared to... The resonance that it's feeling in the case itself. You can hear the tone rising. There we go. If the printer is ever moving, at those frequencies while it's printing, your whole table's gonna be shaking. By having the vibration compensation system, you can make the printer move in not those spaces, or if it has to move through that frequency range, it'll slow down or speed up to avoid that little hole of extreme violence. So, it's gone back to it's parked position. Hey, there's... It's gotta smiley face. On our home screen here, we have bed temperature, hot end temperature, print time remaining, the status of the printer, which is fine. It's got all the stuff you need. Second page here, is kind of your transport controls. We can home the printer, we can move these at access, up and down, and we also have our fan speeds and all that sort of thing, as well. We also have SD card support. So, you can print from a micro SD card, but what I've been doing, and what I like doing, is using the Bambu Studio App. Which, we'll have a look in a minute to send the printer the files through their cloud service. Which is, problematic but you can set it to LAN mode. One of the things that makes the Bambu printer's so impressive, is the motion system. And, the P1P gets the same one as the X1, and the X1 Carbon. The entire hot end assembly, here, is a CORD XY system, and uses two motors at the back, with a pair of belts to move it in very precise... Little dance of adjustment. The XS's Gantry is made of two carbon fiber rods with the belts sandwiched between. And, that allows the weight to be really, really low, because the printer has to move this entire assembly back and forward, at like... Ridiculous speeds. This is our hot end assembly, right here. And, this is our direct drive extruder. We also have an interesting feature, this filament cutter, which it'll automatically slice off the filament if you're doing changes, or anything like that, to keep the whole path really pure, and make sure that there's not extra colors and things in there. We also have the filament run out sensor, which is super nice. You can take this whole thing apart yourself, it doesn't have any special screws. It's just this Allen Key and this Allen Key, all the bolts in the entire machine are pretty much just these two, which is great. Here's the spool of PLA basic. There's a little tag right there, and Bambu does something interesting. They put an RFID tag on the spool itself, when you're using the AMS, it'll automatically read that tag and feed the printer the type of plastic it is. It's settings, it's color, and how much you have remaining in the spool. Unfortunately, this is a Bambu proprietary type of tag, and I'm really hoping that they'll eventually open that up for anybody else to use. But, it's only available on their filament right now. Now, let's just get this plugged in, and we'll start a print. And, I can show you how fast this thing goes. Bambu Studio is actually a fork of PrusaSlicer, all open source, you can find the entire un-built code on Bambu's GitHub, which is super nice to see. For how proprietary Bambu's has kind of made this ecosystem, there's actually a lot of stuff that's really open about it. All of the slicer, and pretty much all the settings for the printer themselves, you can modify. I would find that this printer would drive me insane if I couldn't modify some of the checks. Thankfully, Bambu has included a bunch of different startup scripts, which just exists as start and end G-Code. So, you can modify them to however you want. I have a couple custom ones in here that I found online. People have already started writing fast startup scripts. Which, gets that 7 minutes down to about 30 seconds, without any loss. You maybe need to do a full startup script once in a while, but it saves all the settings and firmware. Yeah, it seems to run a modified version of Marlin, as well. So, you can send this printer just to G-Code, you don't have to use Bambu Studio. You just load your G-Code onto the micro SD card, and it'll print right from that just fine. So, I'm gonna use the pre-done, pre-set, here for the startup, which is gonna be the P1P, with the default 0.4mm nozzle. If we look at the advanced section here, we can see all the bed details, we can see the printable height, 250 millimeters on this. We have thee G-Code flavor, which is Marlin Legacy. That's how we know it's Marlin. And, we can also see the filament load time and unload time. So, that's an adjustment setting, to if you wanted it to pull back the filament, how much to pull it back for, that sort of thing. We have access to all of our machine G-Code's, here. Just like you know from PrusaSlicer. And then, we have our motion ability. Which is crazy. The maximum speed of the X and Y carriage is 500 millimeters a second. And, you're not going to be printing at that speed, but that's gonna be your travel speeds. For you Americans, that's gonna be 20 inches per second. You know, it's quick, it's scary, you'll see that. When you get into printers this capable, you kind of stop worrying about the movement capabilities of the printers, and you start having to worry about how much plastic you can extrude. Let's just do a God damn print, how 'bout that? We'll just do the .16 optimal. And, we hit slice. It'll give us our time, this'll take 19 minutes with the full print. We'll go print play. It says 19 minutes, it's gonna use 5 and a half grams of filament. We select our printer here, and I would like to do bed-leveling, and... Cannot send the print job to printer who's firmware is required to be updated. Okay, we'll be back in a minute. I found another box in the box. We did our firmware update, it didn't take very long, which was kind of nice. What's this? So, this printer's in pre-release right now, so when you buy the pre-release one, you get some extra goodies. So, you get that light, you get the camera, and you get the layer fan. Which is... Which is sick. Look at this thing. He's a beefy boy. Let's install this, I think it's pretty simple, it just kind of clips on. So, it's just got a ribbon cable here, with some sticky tape. If you've got a micro SD card in there, you can record video, in 720 or 1080, and it'll also do time lapses, and there's special time lapse G-Code that it'll inject. So, when it does a layer, it'll move the hot end out of the way, take a picture, so your print comes out of nowhere and there's no hot end jumping around on top, which is kind of cool. In. There. While we're waiting for the bed to heat up and everything to get warm, let's talk about the build plate. So, it's got these magnetic sheets and it looks like they've included my favorite plate, which is the textured PEI 1. You don't have to use any glue or stuff on it, and it's good for other things. The problem is that it leaves a bit of a rough surface, which you might not want. They're magnetic, they are double sided, which is really nice, and they offer two or three different styles of bed. The magnets are really strong, which can be a bit of a problem, as the distance at the rear are like... Maybe a little bit too small, but that's a problem with all the printers. The other thing that this printer's missing is the light art. So, Bambu have included a feature that I've never really seen on any other printer, which is a small laser radar gun machine, that sticks out the side of the hot end assembly. And, what'll do is it'll draw a little pattern on the front edge of the bed. Basically, it's an extrusion compensation system, because when the print head is moving really fast, the plastic is leaving the nozzle, but it's maybe not leaving it evenly. And, so you kind of get thinner lines and then as you slow down to make a corner, the lines get thicker as the plastic that it's pushed through is maybe overcompensating. And so, what this does is it kind of moves in a jerking motion, and the line kind of waves around like this. And, then it'll measure that and in-calibrate itself immediately for that. So, we're gonna do our initial home, just find the base level of where the bed is, compared to the nozzle. It's going to wipe the tip again. And, now it's going to just... Really just make sure the tip is wiped. And, it's adjusting the temperate up and down consistently. So now, we're doing our final bed level. Gotta wiggle, this printer likes to wiggle a lot. The textured PEI bed has a slight adjustment for the base layer, because there's maybe a slight undulation in the surface it touches. So, the start script will automatically compensate for that. And, depending on what bed you're using, you don't have to worry about that compensation, it'll all be handled manually in the start G-Code, which is really nice. We're 25 percent through this print, and it's still just setting up. We can fix this with the custom scripts, which skips all of this, it makes everything fast, it'll wipe the tip once and it'll... (mimicking printer) And then, you're done. Like, come on, it's... Half the print time is just the setup. I mean, I like that. You know, you're new at printing, this bed leveling system that we're doing right here, is one of the hardest things to learn. It does a quick vibration calibration system as it cuts off my finger. Now, we get into the fun stuff. So, this is now our full speed. I shouldn't, but I'm just gonna disable the part fan so I can still talk. One of the fun things that Bambu has included is your speed control. I wish they had included a more fine granular speed control, but this is standard mode. I'm gonna switch it to sport mode, now. There we go. Now, we're in sport mode. You can see those movements are like... (mimics printer) it's kind of crazy. And then, Bambu has also included, because of course they did, Ludacris mode. Which we are now in, now. The reason it's sounding crunchy like that, is just because this model has a lot of... Tessellations on it, it's not very smooth, so it can't do the arc calculations that it needs to. The best thing about having a printer that can print this quickly, is you can iterate through prototypes way faster. With my Bambu's, I can do maybe four to six prototypes in the time that it would take a competing printer of the same kind of price range to print one. Just having that acceleration, and that travel speed and that movement speed, is so much more useful to getting prints done. Normally, the trade-off is quality or speed. And, you can have both with any of the Bambu printers, including this one. Yeah, I really like that they've included the same motion system. They're not quiet printers. The X1 and the X1 Carbon are a little quieter because they have the sides on it. They come with tempered glass tops and fronts. Even without the fans on... It's printing really fast, and so the whole motion system is gonna make a bunch of noise. So, here's an example of the pressure advanced calibration. So, that's the fast start, that didn't take 7 minutes, it took maybe 1-2 minutes, that's medium level 1, with a proper bed level and calibration. Again, our first layer is gonna be nice and slow. And then, it ramps up after that. I really like the custom motion paths that they have in here. When it reaches the end of the line, it does a little twirl to break off the end and make it a little bit more seamless. So, I wanna remind you that this is the default standard speed that it's moving at. We can get a breakdown in Bambu Studio. So, this is currently printing at 230 mm/s, which is quite a lot, actually. I think they've done something strange with their filaments, because... When we get to this level of motion platform, the only thing limiting your printing speed becomes volumetric flow. And, this one, with the Bambu filament, can push 21 millimeters cubed per second of filament, which is a meaningless number in my brain, but is basically the amount of volume that it can push through per second. I would really love to see Bambu put a bigger hot end or offer an extended hot end, like the Volcano, to really push that melt zone higher. Instead of having to get multiple printers to work on prototypes that could take 14 hours, or something like that, you can be iterating on a day instead of overnight. Say I wanted to check the fitment between the rings, it's this little gyro model thing... It takes me 20 minutes to iterate, instead of what would probably be about an hour, or maybe three hours on another printer that wasn't Core XY. I mean, even at 230 mm/s for this print, it's still conservative. We can push this higher, we can use the sport mode, we can use the Ludacris mode. Your print quality's gonna suffer, but you're still able to get those prints out even faster. Because the limit of this printer is 500 mm/s, you have unlimited movement capabilities, and it's really just limited by the hot end on this machine. Which is, a bit of a shame. But, shouldn't be too hard for them to release a super extended version. I mean, the bed levels with the tool itself, you're gonna lose some print height, but that would be amazing. I wanna go faster, speed! This has minus proofing, so if I pull out the power cord, it should restore itself, which is kind of nice. I'm not gonna do that, because I don't want to be here all day. Okay, and we're done. What it did, is it moved to the back and then cuts the filament, and then makes sure that it's all ready to go for next time. It's pooped out the back. This is it's little purge thing. It uses about 150 millimeters of filament, which is kind of a lot. With the fast start that you can find online, or write yourself, you can get that down to about five or ten. We have this magnetic bed, and the part has immediately come off. Looks quite good. And again, we have this little gyro spinner thing, which is kind of cool. It's printed completely without support, and everything's nice and separate. It's interesting, you can actually see the tesselation on the outside, which is from the model itself. If your model, or STL is exported with a low resolution, you'll actually have less triangles on the outside, and so the arc fitting that this machine will do isn't so great. It's interesting this printer will reproduce those artifacts in the model itself, which is really cool. Yeah, this feels great and it only took about... I don't know, then minutes to print. With that seven minutes of start time, which is always a bit disappointing. Well, it's about half the price of the competitor, that everybody likes. It feels weird, it feels silly to like a product this much, especially doing a sponsored review, and I don't know how I feel about that. But, I think... If we're trying to keep open and transparent, the list of positives is basically everything, and the list of negatives is stuff I think can be fixed in software. I don't have the level of engineering degrees required to properly describe all the little nuisance features that it has. I'm basically a more advanced hobbyist at this point, but I think this is a real game changer for the whole industry. Every other printer manufacturer should be scared of Bambu. If you're not copying this product, and you're not making clones of this product, and you're a 3D printer company, and you're not bringing out a product like this, then you're screwed, basically. It's incredible, good job, guys. If you want a 3D printer... Only buy this one. Unless it's too expensive, then buy another one. But, you'll have more headaches and spend more time than with the P1P.

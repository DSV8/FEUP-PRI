    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going guys? This is Dave2D. So, last year we did a review of a toothbrush by a company called Quip. They're based out of New York, and I didn't love the product, it was pretty good, looks really nice, but I kept it around at work, just because I wanted a toothbrush at work, and I continued to order refills for it, just because it was convenient. The last refill that came in, came with a free upgrade to their second generation toothbrush, much improved, hence this second review. So, Quip makes electric and manual toothbrushes that come in different colors and stuff, but they sell them via a subscription service, so you order toothbrush from them and if you want every three months or so, they'll send you a new head and/or toothpaste, if that's what you've ordered. Now the one I have is the electric version and it costs $40. When it comes in, you get the toothbrush and a holder inside a travel case or like a travel tube, some toothpaste and some pamphlets on dental care and stuff. The handle is aluminum and it feels surprisingly well-made, like I don't know about the plastic ones, but the metal handles have a really nice way to them. They're densely packed, right? There's a motor and a battery in a really small metal tube. Now, I know, it's just a toothbrush and a lot of people don't care about this kind of stuff, but I think they did a really good job on the aesthetics. The holder doesn't use sticky tape, it's actually a reusable suction mechanism super easy to install and if you ever want to move it around you can. It's also a better holder than the old one, it drains better and the bottom pops off, so it's easier to clean. The heads now snap off instead of being a pull off and they feel much more secure when they're attached. The mechanism on the inside is quite different from before. So, this new one has a few more O rings that make it waterproof, but the most significant improvement is how the vibrations get to the bristles. I'm not sure exactly what they did. But it's a stronger vibration at the head which I assume does a better job cleaning your teeth. It still uses a triple-a battery that lasts around three months. And I've been using a rechargeable battery with no problem. The brush heads have some soft rubber bristles things around the edge. Now the whole thing doesn't spin, they just kind of vibrate when you brush. This new version gives a really solid brushing experience. It actually feels like any top name brand vibrating toothbrush, but it looks a lot nicer. It also has a tongue scraper and a two-minute timer. The toothpaste is a pretty standard minty flavor and it'll last you around three months for the tube. Now the equip subscription service itself, I used to think it wasn't that useful, because really how hard is it to get a toothbrush and a toothpaste wherever you want to North America. But I will say this: ever since I've had the Quip and the convenience of just having the heads delivered to work, every three months, I have never once missed brushing my teeth after lunch not even once in a year. It's kind of weird like I normally don't have compliance issues with brush my teeth, but normally I wouldn't brush my teeth after lunch at work. It's just the way it is, but now that they're here and now that the heads are there, I just use them. The other thing is if you're looking for a modern looking toothbrush like an electric toothbrush, that doesn't have a charging cable and stuff, this is like the only good one out there. That's the end of this video. I hope you guys liked it. Give me some thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it. It's been nice. See you guys next time.",

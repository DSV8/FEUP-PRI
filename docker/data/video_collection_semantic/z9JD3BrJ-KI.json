    "transcript": "this is a common Garden variety PS5 and for today's video I bought a whole bunch of crap off of AliExpress to turn it into something a little bit more special [Music] oh I'm quite excited about this as you can see it's 4p5 controller you just clip it onto the front of your P5 and then you have a charger stand for your P5 controllers the best part about it is I don't really know how you can screw up a product like this What's it gonna do make my P5 spew Anthrax into the room and besides how can you not trust a product by a company basically called ipapago unfortunately the P5 console and controllers are not included which is a bit of a shame that just looks like a plasticky controller charging P5 top hat so um yeah next thing it is a centrifice Fugal cooling fan for the P5 and it's also by papega who are clearly industry leaders in ridiculous PS5 accessories just a quick note so you're not disappointed later in the video I don't have the test equipment to measure the temperatures of a PS5 in not a stupid way however we will see what kind of effect it has on the noise now I'm guessing this whole Contraption kind of Clips onto the back of the PS5 and then the centrifugal fan isn't there it plugs straight into one of the USB ports on the back of the console so you don't have to worry about cables and stuff with it that's some real Innovation there I beta oh and it even passes through so you can still use that USB port we have our fan speed selector that actually has quite a satisfying clicking sound that's real fancy feeling this honestly looks like a pretty terrible idea to me but who knows maybe it's gonna work really well [Music] wait it actually that's so cool they gave us some stickers in the box with it that's such a nice thought now I probably would have taken a closed box over some stickers every day of the week the product is a cooling stand for the PS5 so we're gonna have Cooling in the bottom and cooling on the back it comes with LED strips so we can RGB up rps5 I actually think I have even more RGB strips somewhere I'm pretty sure these RGB strips go around the fan under the cover so you can get some tasteful PS5 underglown nice oh those are some worryingly small fans and you know what they say about fans the smaller they are the more they sound like Harpy seals I guess I don't know what a harpy seal sounds like it also comes with a couple USB ports although I think one of these has to be used to plug the cooler into the console we are gonna have the coolest PS5 in all the land oh there's a bunch of stuff in here so we didn't lose any package wait these are just RGB stickers I'm 90 sure the listing said these were going to be RGB light strips now in my opinion the listing is slightly misleading because it does refer to it as an LED light bar and then there's a whole bunch of pictures of it lighting up RGB on a PS5 but in all fairness to the seller it does mention skin sticker decal and between all of the pictures of RGB lighting there are a couple of pictures of it just being a sticker so I I guess you be the judge of how misleading this is maybe it's one of those new self-emissive stickers i've been hearing about [Music] oh they just folded it in half like that that's no good what the hell look at that they just ruined the insert sticker thing that is that's like that's I'm actually outraged by that why would they not package it in a way that it didn't it there was plenty of space this was one of the only things that I actually thought unironically was gonna look cool on it and then the seller damaged it that I am I I am gonna need a moment to recover from this outrage now luckily this one seems to have not been folded in half now of course we had to get some of the obligatory waifu accessories now I'm probably not going to use this waifu decal for the P5 because I have something better lined up in my opinion but it's always nice to have the option for waifu you know wait a minute it says it's a skin sticker for the PS5 disc Edition but the instructions on the back show you how to install a sticker on what is clearly a PS4 I mean it looks like it'll fit on the PS5 so you know okay it's fine it should be okay [Music] oh oh very nearly dropped it but would you look at that magnificence beautiful golden plastic not only is it the color of kings and it's so gold your face very visibly reflects in it it's also got ventilation on the side of it so that your PS5 can breathe a little better I'm pretty sure this is the centerpiece that's going to elevate our PS5 from a common bit of garbage trash to the levels of a fixture in the bathroom of a president's suite at the Trump Hotel now I'm not entirely sure what order to do all of this in because you know it's not a kit we are gonna have to figure it out for ourselves but I think a good starting point is to remove These Wings from the side of the PS5 and then maybe get all of the stickers attached oh okay there we go that was abrupt ooh there's the inside of our PS5 or at least inside adjacent and then when it comes to the other side I think we just kind of flip it around basically the same thing you just lift this off oh that's so easy to do now first I'm gonna try and figure out where these RGB stickers are meant to go they didn't come with instructions so hopefully we can figure it out I think they're supposed to go here as supposed to in here which means I should probably stick them on the inside of the gold clam shell which should look real good but before I try that let's see if it works on the inside of the console [Music] um that's not that's definitely not right because nothing makes plastic gold look classier than an RGB sticker because of the non-standard ridges on the shell it doesn't really work here either but whatever that'll do let's move on to the next thing now in terms of spine decoration considering that the one I was actually excited about was brutalized by the seller we're gonna have to use a little bit of waifu sticker [Music] this is such a complete pack that it even comes with waifu stickers for your PS5 the problem with this sticker kit though is the ones we're actually going to be using over the spine aren't particularly waifuy I mean where is our anatomically highly improbable cleavage but I guess we don't have any other choice do we ignoring the fact that I didn't do it particularly well because you know I'm an idiot but the colors don't match so you just have this like mismatched bit of thing over the inside of your PS5 why would anyone want this [Music] it doesn't even fit down it's like the sticker doesn't take into account the curvature of the controller because the moment you stick it down that happens now after I finished terribly adding the decals to the PS5 controller and I suggested that I try using a heat gun as per the instructions and the heat gun made a big difference helping the sticker conform to the curvature of the controller and I think if you know what you're doing you can apply these controller decals in a way that makes it not look like a five-year-old did it but unfortunately I only consulted Anna after I finished filming the whole video so please ignore the terrible decal application for the rest of the video oh and obviously the heat gun didn't fix the color mismatch of the decals over the spine of the PS5 now let's get back to me proudly showing the result of my sticker application before the heat gun I don't know this looks perfect to me so um let's get to the next step next I tried adding the gold side panels and the right one very stubbornly didn't want to clip in place I don't think it fits but after a whole bunch of struggle it finally gave in yes yes it finally clipped in place oh this one clipped in nice and easily okay oh what a magnificent Beast now the next step is functionality upgrades with RI papega add-ons [Music] and in this cable just plugs in here I guess but I'm not going to plug that in yet I do want to try the centrifugal fan because that has a Hub in it now I'm a bit worried about the centrifugal fan because it looks like there's going to be some clearance issues between it and the controller top hat I don't think they're gonna be cross compatible which is kind of shocking considering that the two accessories are made by the same company I don't know I feel like they should probably work together hmm okay clips into place nicely and it looks frankly wild at this point yeah I think I'm just gonna use the cooler because the problem with the controller top hat is that the cable comes out of the bottom here which means I can't even just cut the back Wings off to make it fit with the centrifugal cooler so unfortunately I'm not going to be able to use both of them which means so far the only two things that haven't worked together were by the same company oh wait I forgot to add these actual LED light strips to the inside which means I've got to take the side panels off again thank you [Music] so I guess now we need to fire up this monstrosity and see what it looks like I'm excited to see these RGB stickers light up because that's definitely going to happen wait aren't these lights supposed to be RGB and not just static white oh there we go there is an RGB button that's better which means it's finally time to admire the magnificence of our creation [Music] [__] up [Music] foreign from its magnificent Beauty even after a short gaming session it became clear that noise was not a strong suit it sounds a bit like having an air conditioner running on the table next to me I also can't really get over the lady's face that's staring up at me the whole time from the controller it feels Sinister somehow I don't know [Music] oh and for what it's worth I tested the controller charge stand thing and it charges the controller so there you go and with that thank you for watching this very stupid video If you enjoyed it consider subscribing to the channel and even if you didn't enjoy it subscribe to the channel because hate watching is always fun and who knows maybe eventually the channel will grow on you like some kind of Insidious fungus anyway until the next video bye-bye [Music] thank you",

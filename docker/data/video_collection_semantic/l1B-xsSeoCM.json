    "transcript": "- So, without further ado, The Tech News. (audience clapping) I let the news speak for itself. New graphics cards have been hard to come by in 2020, so photos of a cryptocurrency mining farm equipped with 78 GeForce RTX 3080s graphics cards are understandably, causing some distress in PC enthusiast circles. The setup was apparently built by Simon Bern in Las Vegas for around $100,000. Where they paid him a hundred thousand or that's how much it costs. - [Man] That's how much it costs. - Ah, and when electricity costs are factored in, it's capable of generating $128,000 per year, in the ethereum. - [Man] Quit your job. - And what's the price of ethereum is that counting 'cause that's (beep) (mumbles). So all Simon could potentially start making money with his disgusting machine about 10 months from now. Why don't you just start mining Bitcoin instead Simon? It just broke the $28,000 mark. That was a trick. Bitcoin will definitely crash at some point. And then we'll be the rich ones. - [Man] Aha! That's our work. - As long as I sell mine before that. As if the story wasn't bad enough, many reports were claiming that a missing shipment of 500,000 RTX 30 GPUs, was found in South Korea. But it turned out the original article was a joke, haha, Posa for Spain's version of April fool's day. Which isn't an April. - [Man] You have been fooled. - When will the madness end? When the RTX 3080 Ti releases. It will fix everything. It's our greatest hope. But perhaps we should look even further into the future for some hope. As rumors are starting to proliferate concerning Nvidia's successor to the ampere architecture. Reportedly codenamed, \"Lovelace\". (Man screaming) Funky town! Incase you're wondering, that's not a reference to Linda, but to Ada Lovelace, the English mathematician writer and Countess. - [Man] How close. - Yes, (laughs) this is diving into money and Nvidia's Lovelace cards may be equally impressive. So far, the rumors say that there'll be built on a five nanometer node instead of ampere's eight nanometer. And the flagship gaming chip, the AD 102 will be capable of 66 teraflops of FP32 computing power, around double that of the RTX 3080. How exciting and distracting from our current GPU lacking reality Lovelace. The very word fills my nostrils with a sweet dream. - [Man] That's not the delivery I was going for, but hey, we'll take it. - And the Intel's, not giving up hope either because more leaks have given us potential idea of the performance we can expect from the companies all their Lake processors. A Geekbench has all for an Alder Lake-S CPU has popped up ,supporting 16 cores and 24 threads. The benchmark has so many cores. Normally you'd expect the thread count to be a double of the core count, on a multi-threaded CPU but Alder Lake will reportedly use a big little design similar to Qualcomm's mobile processors and apples and one chip. Meaning, powerful and in this case, multi-threading capable cores are supplemented by smaller more power efficient cores. In any case, if these Geekbench results are to be believed, it's a setup that might work for Intel as there is some discussion that with slightly higher clock speeds, the CPU could outperform AMD's Ryzen 5950 X. But these chips aren't supposed to come out for at least another year. So, let's not get too excited, 'cause AMD is probably gonna keep making stuff too. - [Man] That's true. - It's time for the quick bits brought to you by Ifixit. Maker of compact toolkits, with all the essential bits to fix small electronics. I mean, look at the minnow. It has 16 driver bits that work with most laptops, desktops, and smartphones, and it's not much bigger than it actual minnow. Which is a small fish. There's tiny little ones by the dock, for those of you have, haven't been outside very much lately. If you need more, the Moray has you covered with an additional 16 bits that will help you repair home appliances. Both have magnetic lids and four millimeters swivel top drivers and, we all use them here, all the time. And we're cool. So get your own and be like us. Learn more at Fixit.com/Linus. - [Man] He's so cool James. - He's the coolest. Quick bits, they're not what you thought they were (laughs). LG has announced a new TV technology. It's not OLed or Q led, it's QNed. Or the way they want it pronounced, QNed. - [Man] Oh! - It's a moped, no pad, no red, you said, (laughs) look, what is this? It's based on miniLED technology and will allow TV's to have up to 2,500 dimming zones. So it's pretty cool. Even if we do have to learn another acronym. I'm all fed up. - [Man] Aah! K-Fed, that's the TV technology report. - [Man] (indistinct) - But I think the end has something to do with quantum dot which is nanosys. Otherwise, NFI no. - [Man] Then acronym. - Boston Dynamics has taught its Atlas spot and even its ostrich looking handle robots, to not only show off some frankly impressive dance moves, but to do so in perfectly timed collaboration with each other,. Because they're robots. You don't have individual personalities. And after the war, they'll have something to do on our grades. - [Man] And we felt barrier. - (laughs) Last year Apple filed a lawsuit against a company named Corellium, way cooler name than Apple, which offered virtualized instances of iOS for developers. Well, Corellium has actually won a victory in that legal battle, with a judge throwing out the portion of Apple's lawsuit related to copyright infringement. Corellium isn't completely off the hook yet but this shows Apple can be hurt. Their Apple skin can be pierced. They're just like morals. Like the rest of us Apple trees. Definitely send me a Facebook invite when it's time to storm their campus. - [Man] See you there. - Corelium, Apple did do something good this week though, when it pulled the vibe together app off its app store. The app promoted invite only secret house parties that helped users, covertly defy, local COVID restrictions and restrictions from their partners against having orgies (laughs) which is definitely something you could not do with any other messaging app. Both of those things (laughs). Plus this one has vibe. You wouldn't get it. And it appears that AT&T's experiment, involving releasing movies in theaters and on HBO Max up the same day, has paid off. Wonder woman in 1984 earned the highest box office opening ever seen during the pandemic, pretty low bar. (laughs) And broke download scores on the streaming service. Oh, okay again, a low bar. So a third wonder woman film is being fast track, which is... - [Man] Ah! - Well, you have to go and check out our review on carpool critics to see our opinion. - [Man] (indistinct) - This Episode is just getting less awesome as we go so now it's over. Come back on Friday for more Tech news and guess what? It'll be 2021 then. All the bad things would be gone. - [Man] (mumbles) - (laughs) 21, more like 2020 fun.",

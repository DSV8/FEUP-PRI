    "transcript": "- Real talk. I thought Samsung was joking when they said they wanted to sponsor an unboxing and demo of the Odyssey Ark. Did anyone actually expect them to make this thing after they showed it off at CES? I assumed that it was just some kind of concept display to pull in the crowd. You know, ooh. Aah. I was wrong. Very, very wrong. 100 pounds of gaming extravagance wrong. This is it: the heaviest, the most curved, the most immersive gaming monitor ever created. And while I don't know if I need an aggressively curved 55 inch monitor. I sure wanna experience it. Let's roll that intro. (upbeat music) Whether you wanted it or not, Samsung has done it. They've brought us the world's first-- Holy crap. 55-inch curved, with a capital C, 1000R radius gaming display. It uses their quantum matrix tech with a mini LED full array local dimming backlight. It's got HDR 10+, Dolby Atmos, and a speaker setup that they, and I cannot wait to experience this, apparently call the Sound Dome. Okay, well, don't go away. - You're gonna need help. - How am I gonna set this up on my own? Samsung demands. - That's just the stand. - This is just the-. - That's one part of the stand. There's a whole second part. - Are you freaking kidding me? Samsung demands that you have a friend to help you set up the Odyssey Ark, and for good reason. Oh my gosh. - So it goes in. - I think it goes the other way. - The other way. Yeah, yeah. - No problem. Just put this together using my trustee LTTstore.com screwdriver. Sign up for an in stock notification LTTstore.com. Wow. I feel like I could almost support myself on this spring lift mechanism. Take that Apple. 'Sup, Mac nerds. That's a nice monitor stand you've got there. This is my Cloud Strife edition monitor stand. - Oi! - The Buster stand. - There we go. Hey, we heard the click. Hey, and then there's two screws. - Yeah. I'll get them. - So--yeah. - But to get it though. Oh, that's it. guys. That's it. That's what I'm talking about. That's why this thing needs the most mondo stand in the world. So you can watch YouTube shorts. You guys have seen me one-hand lift 65-inch TVs even and mount them onto the wall. I've done it on this channel. There is no way that I am lifting this from here to there. That is not happening - By yourself. - Unless I had a helper. - Yeah, you're supposed to, so there- read the directions. - This is how you're supposed to do it. - Yeah. So we get a hand under the stand. - Oh yeah, hand under the stand. - Tilt it. Tilt it back and then we hold it. - Three - Then we use our legs- - Two - and not our back. - One - Yep. - Holy crap, it's heavy. David's coming over here, like, I could do it. I have CRTs. Don't, don't knock it over or anything but just- hold on, hold on, Plouffe, don't help him. - Okay. - Oh my God. - Ohhh. - It's not that bad. - From the ground though. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You're good. You're good. - Don't challenge me if you don't want me to follow through. - Obviously 95% of the time, you're gonna have it like this. And the whole thing, with its four speakers and two integrated sub woofers, comes together to make a personal gaming theater. That is Samsung's words. Not mine. Personal gaming theater. It's like a fun mirror. Oh my God. I'm wide Putin. - It recommends 80 cm distance. - 80 centimeters. - Yeah. So I gotta be back here. - Apparently. - Huh. (laughs) - Turn it vertical for Alex. - Oh my God. Yeah, here you go, Alex. Ready? This is an officially supported mode. - Aww, that's so cool. Can we get three of them? - What are we gonna do with three of them? - What would you do with one of them? You might as well get three. - Everything about it is perfectly normal monitor, except that it's as tall as I am. We've seen this before but it's cool enough that it's worth another mention. This is called Samsung One Connect and basically it's a single cable. You can see the TV end is marked TV right here. That goes into the back of your personal gaming theater. Cable manages through this boy and carries all the power and all the signal data that our display is going to need. That means that any of your devices plug into this BAMFer, the One Connect box. You've got your- oh, is there no display port? - No. - So it's a TV then - It's all HDMI 2.1. - All four of them are HDMI 2.1? - Yeah, one with the Ark. - Wow. I'm not even gonna miss the display port then. - It's 4k. - Whoa, shut up. - Yeah. - Sorry, I'm gonna let you finish, but I've read it off there. - Yeah. - It's 4k, 165 Hertz. It has a USB-B up-link, two USB-A ports, though they are USB 2.0. So you're not gonna use them for anything other than, maybe your keyboard or mouse, something along those lines. It's got optical. Has a network port. So presumably it uses Samsung's Tizen OS for smart TV functionality. And a total of ,as we mentioned before, four HDMI 2.1 ports. - Can't move it. - I can't even move it. - I know, it's huge. - Now we are gonna need a tape measure. I wanna sit in the optimal position in my personal gaming theater. And I think the reflection was (hums fanfare) 'cause there's a peel on it. Oh yeah. That's way less reflective. Naturally, we've gone with an RTX 3090 for our test bench, because let's face it, if you can afford a personal gaming theater like this one, it's only the finest for you when it comes to GPUs. And I think other than that, we're ready to fire it up, aren't we? It uses the same remote as Samsung's TVs. That's interesting. You can really tell that the sound is optimized for a nearfield listening experience. - Really? - Yeah. Or maybe part of it is just that you're sitting in this reflective Sound Dome. That's what they call it, right? Sound Dome? - It's got four speakers. One in each corner and two subs in the center. - Does it come preloaded with all this stuff? - Yeah. - Okay, you got your GeForce Now. Got your Xbox app. - Yeah. Those are all part of the Samsung gaming hub. So you could stream games if you wanted to. No downloads and no storage limits. - Yeah. I forgot Samsung has that partnership with Microsoft so you can just play Xbox games on it. Okay. Pretty cool. I mean, we're PC around here, so we're gonna go ahead and switch over to our PC input. Let's go through and fine tune our settings. Yeah. Faster is almost always the right one. Standard is probably fine. Screen ratio. Yeah, we're not gonna change that. Unless, of course, we wanted to have the ultra wide experience. Get some black bars, more cinematic gaming going on here. Hundred. Yeah, there it goes. Okay. And I don't see any weird scaling issues. So if that's what you want, then you can do that. Personally, I think I would probably just make use of the entire canvas in front of me. Oh this is not a good place for this. - Why not? - Because. - Oh, if you wanna rotate. - Yeah, when it's time-. Oh, it clears it. - Just push it back a little, yeah. It's great. - Okay. Nevermind, it works. Oh my God. - Hold on. No, it'll auto. It'll auto. - No, no, no, no, no, no. We'll get to that later. We'll get to that later. Oh, lighting. Definitely gonna need some lighting. Oh, may increase power consumption. Yeah. I think that's the least of my concerns. When I've got a 55-inch, 2000 nit peak brightness, mini LED back-lit gaming monitor on my desk. Let's see what other modes we've got. Ooh, we've got some different colors. Got some- oh, oh, are we going full unicorn vomit? Yes. [Laughs] HDR 10 gaming basic? Game HDR. This actually makes a ton of sense 'cause they're probably just leaning on all the excellent work their TV folks have done and putting it in a monitor. Weird. The setup is actually that simple. I didn't even manage to get the Ark Dial out of the box and it is already paired. So, that's neat. With the Ark Dial, you can quickly access any settings that you would want to, as well as quickly change the aspect ratio or the screen size. So if you wanted to emulate a different screen size and let's figure out what button. Hey, there we go. Ooh. Multi view. Flex move screen. - Yeah. You want flex move. - Yeah, let's do. Imma flex. Imma flex on the haters. What? You don't even have an Ark Dial? Hey hey ho, why are you doing? - Now, it's got buttons. You can move it around. - Yeah yeah yeah, I see them. I see them. I see it. So I'm gonna put my screen over here. What, you can't-? Your monitor doesn't do this? That's okay. If you don't have this, at the very least, you can get a subscription over on floatplane.com. Where we have great behind the scenes. Like, oh, we had a ton of fun at the backpack launch popup shop. You guys can check that out. Okay. So I think, yeah, I'm done with that for now. This can sit here. Man, when was the last time you saw this many peripherals for a monitor? You got the One Connect box. You got the Ark Dial. You got the remote. Okay. I get the game on it now. - Yeah, sure. I thought we'd do vertical stuff first, but it's already-. - No. We're gonna do vertical later. - Okay. You wanna do landscape first? - Yeah. I wanna play a game. - I don't know if it's finished installing, but I put Ark on the test bench. Cause that'd be funny if you played Ark. Yo dawg, I heard you like Ark. - Yeah. I wanted to get an Ark GPU as well. - Right. - So that we could play Ark on an Ark using an Ark. - Yeah. Yeah yeah. - But they're not really out yet. And I mean, I don't know if it'll run 4k, so. - Uniformity was an immediate concern for me. Brandon, you're gonna have to get a little bit closer to have the same experience that I'm having, but I do not actually see any kind of dirty screen effect. Oh. And I might not even be in the optimal spot either. - 80 cm, 80 cm. - 80 centimeters. Okay. Let's see who was right. 'Cause I don't remember what I said actually, but. - I think that was right. - Okay, this is the optimal eye hole distance from the screen. Thank you. I will not move my feet. - I'll put a marker down, hold on. - (impact sounds) Is this an HDR game? 'Cause this is really fricking bright. - No, it's probably not. It's old and stuff. - So this thing is just really bright. - This is literally entirely for the memes. - Now one of the challenges with mini LED back lighting is that depending on how many zones you have you can get significant halos when you've got bright objects on a dark background. But, that problem is exacerbated by extreme viewing angles. So it seems to me that Samsung's Odyssey Ark team sought to get around this, at least in part, by applying such an aggressive curve to the screen. Because when I am standing in this optimal position here, I am actually looking straight at the screen. No matter what part of it, my eyes are tracking toward. Samsung's name for this anti-glare, anti-reflection film is apparently sAGAR film and it's not sAGAR the Horrible, it's sAGAR pretty good. That's an old reference. Isn't Nick supposed to be at work. What's he doing playing Cookie Clicker? This is the danger of adding your boss on Steam. - It's an idle game, Linus. Just, it's just idle right now. These are really deep blacks. - It's got 1,056 dimming zones. It has 1,056 dimming zones? - It's pretty good. - Well that explains it. 'Cause I was like, I'm looking at this going- - Where is the dimming zone? - that's really black. How much is this thing? - 3500. - 3500. Okay. I mean they did put all the cookies and cream in it. The stand is enough to kill a man. Assuming you can wield it. - Check the display. Make sure the display's got HDR on, too. Use the dial. What are you doing? - Oh yeah. What am I doing? - The remote is for cavemen. - What am I, some kind of idiot? - Hold on. - You got it. Yeah. No, no. I'm just, I'm looking. I'm looking. Oh it's almost definitely HDR. That's so bright. - Totally. Well, probably. - It's gotta be. I'm having too much fun with this thing. - It's dumb. - It's extravagant as all hell, but it's pretty fun. It's pretty cool. So when you're full screened, okay? You get variable refresh rate with AMD FreeSync Premium Pro with support up to at least 120 Hertz, low frame rate compensation, low latency and SDR and HDR and full support for HDR color and luminance certification. This looks fricking amazing. Zero tearing or stutter. Hyper responsive. Bright HDR. We have not tested Samsung's 2000 nit claims but frankly speaking, at this distance, it's bright enough. That does matter. And the wild part is that Samsung is normally the king of blown out, vibrant best buy effect colors. But it's vibrant, but it's not like that at all. Like, look at these greens. They're not overdone. Friendly reminder: no matter how good your gaming display is it will not make you a pro gamer. Okay. Quick play. Here we go, boys. I'm the one person playing Halo Infinite right now. - Is this gonna be your new office monitor? - Ah, 55 inches is really big. - I know - My desk isn't deep enough at work. - You don't think so? - No, I don't think so. - What about at home? - Ah, it's tempting at home. I just got a super deep desk at home. It's deeper than this one. - Hey, all right. I mean, there you go. Hey. Oh, you didn't get him. - How did I not get that guy? - I don't know. I thought for sure he was dead. - I am terrible. - You gotta swap to the pistol. - Blah. I don't have to do nothing. I don't have to do what you say. - All right. - I'm never gonna call you dad. - All right. There's quad object tracking sound and Dolby Atmos. - Dolby Atmos, you say? Obviously, it doesn't have the same bass as a sub woofer that's the size of the TV or anything like that, but not bad. The clarity's good. And I guess there's something to be said for having speakers that are just physically separated from each other, right? When you're sitting right close to it like this. Full credit, the sound stage is really wide. The directionality is outstanding. When there's a frog over here, it sounds like it's coming from over there. Enough of the can confirm, it's a top of the line gaming monitor. Let's have a look at the gimmick: cockpit mode. (grunts) Oh yeah. (grunts) And you say it's supposed to oh, it does too. - Yeah. It did - Automatically moved to portrait mode. Wow. I mean, that is something. Feel like I'm in the front row, you know what I'm saying? Videos. Okay. Let's find some shorts. Whoa. Wow, it's right there. It's big. Hey look. It's Linus actual size, on your TV. (laughs) Okay. I had to try it. I had to try it. Come on. Oh geez. Oh my goodness. This is-. Wow, this is a little disorient-amalating. - It barely fits on screen. - Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. This is, you're actually fighting life-size demons. Okay. They are life-size. Now it's time for, perhaps, an actual practical application to this. Let's try multi view. Press the button below to add a view. Let's add a view. Oh, oh sick. Okay. So you could have-. Okay, app or source. Man, we don't have a ton of sources here. - No. So you're able to mirror stuff through mirror cast or whatever, and you can have the apps. But my one big issue is that you can't do two HDMIs. - Really? You can't do two different HDMI? - Yeah, it was very- I was ecstatic about this thing until I found that out. We even tried, I grabbed the Xbox and I tried to throw the Xbox and the PC on. It doesn't want to do it. As soon as you select one HDMI input, it grays out the rest. When you go to do the second view. The way I was doing this was create a custom multi view but you've got three. - Can you do ties-in apps or anything like that? If you had a Plex app or something like that, could you just have a movie chill in there? - Yeah. So it's fine. It's just kind of disappointing that it doesn't-. - Two HDMI inputs would be better. I'd love to see them address that in a firmware update or something like that. Because as it is, this could actually make sense. - Yeah. - I just have some app with, I don't know, like my stocks or something. Whatever it is that I want peripherally available to me. And then I've got maybe a movie that's playing while I'm working on a project down here in my bottom monitor. - Yeah. That's great. - That's wild, man. - And then if it's horizontal, you can do four 27-inch screens, roughly. - Four 27 inch screens. - Yeah. So you can do the same thing, but quad. - That's pretty cool. I do wish that you could have two HDMI sources, That would improve it a lot. - Or four 'cause there's four HDMI 2.1 ports on the Connect Box. - That would be amazing. Samsung, if you're listening, that's an improvement that we would like to see. It really does have a concept product vibe to it, that wow factor. But then they actually did it. The mad lads actually shipped it. Thanks Samsung for sponsoring this video. Thank you for sending over the Odyssey Ark. The most unbelievable monitor that I think I have ever seen. (laughs) Look at it. If you enjoyed this video I don't even know what to send you to. I don't know. There was, there was that curved laptop we checked out that one time. Go watch that. That's pretty wild, too.",

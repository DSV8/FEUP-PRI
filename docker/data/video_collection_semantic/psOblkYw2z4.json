    "transcript": "good people you know I love me a small compact enclosure that is space efficient because I'm not running in SLI I'm not using mechanical spinning discs I just want a nice efficient cooler single GPU bunch of SSDs and the power supply that fits it's this nice compact package but it's also about space efficiency because I moved away from having mid towers and full towers beside my you know my desk and stuff because having this tiny little enclosure here that is super powerful without any compromises is awesome and today that case changes looks like customs have gracefully opened the package for me thank you for ruining the unboxing experience and ripping this whole box open come on this my friends is the Streamcom that and so this case is all about a style this is what's three cameras known for with their aluminum designs nice compact form factor - I think it's slightly smaller than my eighth one from in wind and also having a modular interior design it's not necessarily needed for an ITX form factor because you have so little room to work with but it is there regardless so you do have the flexibility of mounting your motherboard and mounting all your other components in a non-traditional way that is a possibility all right so let's check it out right this it's time to join the RGB Club with team group delta SSD with gorgeous addressable or standard RGB illumination with simple connectivity in the huge lighting area to spice up your system with some color check out the team group delta SSD down below man what an experience for the system is now assembled I have successfully replaced the in with a one with the Streamcom DA2 and the experience was satisfactory obviously when it's over because ITX is always challenging especially when you're dealing with something that you know with the components that you normally would not put in such a confined space but once it's all finished and it looks beautiful in my space you do appreciate and there's a nice sense of accomplishment when the whole thing is complete and pretty much all ITX enclosures have some form of challenges for assembly process and hardware compatibility and Streacom DA2 is not an exception and before I proceed check out the description below for all the links for parts and alternatives for awesome ITX systems so this case is coming from streak um a company that brought us the DB for a fantastic fanless cube aluminum gorgeous art piece of an enclosure while the two is more targeted towards a little bit more towards mainstream but still kind of like confined to that niche target because of the price point at over $200 so it is competing with the likes of Dan case and many other you know a similar size and approach in terms of this beautiful aluminum elegance that you would normally not be able to get with a standard ITX enclosure and that's okay because variety is awesome and so if you're just thinking of building an ITX system this is most likely not for you but if you're thinking of doing something special that is kind of part of your space it's not just there to house components then you kind of you know you have many options and the Steacom is one of them now design wise it is simple and elegant nice symmetrical approach to perforation and the curves top and bottom left and right side so it's quite awesome but putting it beside like a gaming router you can see the striking difference while putting it on a shelf as a showcase piece makes more sense the one thing that is kind of a double-edged sword for me is the front IO I appreciate the simplicity of it with a simple power button and a type C port however the type C is not gen - it's still gen one speeds and I actually don't have any type C accessories to plug into that so that's kind of an unfortunate thing where I cannot use the IO over here and have to resort to my standard USB ports on a motherboard for any connection there and so while we all want the type C implementation to really spread when it's just type C you know connection that is a compromise where you cannot plug any of you USB accessories unless you have a dongle so it looks like we approach the dongle life for the desktop looking at the back this is the only place where you can find the actual model name we have two PCI slots and a 92 millimeter fan mount okay so the side panel mount is pretty neat because as you can see they don't use any thumb screws for design purposes instead these side panels are almost pressure mounted so you push on one of the corners at the top and pull one in the corners at the bottom one at a time and then this the side panel simply comes off they have rubber pegs on all four corners to help with that pressure point and to absorb any vibrations if there are any so this mount is awesome because it's functional and it's super easy to do and it also helps with the whole design thing but also I appreciate that the panels are totally refined you're handling like almost you know really hard edges on the aluminum but everything is nice and smooth it's not sharp so I'm not worried about cutting myself open reinstallation by the way is just going in Reverse put the top ones in first and then nice now moving inside you can really appreciate Streacom totally different approach to mounting your hardware using universal brackets and they've taken this from their previous enclosures and really refined it here so we have two Universal brackets horizontal and vertical and they can be used to attach anything like up to 180 millimeter fans single hard drive or multiple hard drives SSD or multiple SSDs again and that gives you like a lot of flexibility in terms of what you can populate inside there without needing additional like specifically tailored SSD caddies or hard drive caddies because you know with simple to universal brackets you can do a lot with them and the cool thing about the universal brackets is how they're mounted to the frame so there's a rail system on both the top and the bottom that attaches to the universal brackets with a nut and a screw so that's how it's being held in there's also a little cutout here so you can remove one of the nuts so it's pretty cool because it gives you that total flexibility on exactly where the universal bracket is attached it's not necessarily locked to a certain position because of that entire rail system both on both sides actually that works with both the vertical ones and horizontal two furthermore we have this additional power supply and drive cage bracket that is further attached on more of these Universal brackets so you there again modular so with the drive cage for example you can install multiple SSDs on there without occupying any of the other Universal brackets and that's for the power supply here you can mount an SFX or NSF X L power supply without interfering with that drive bracket or you can go full out with an ATX power supply I would definitely recommend sticking with a smaller power supply unit so you can have more room for radiators beside the motherboard more room for those SSDs because with the ATX power supply mountain in there it basically occupies that entire chunk of the front section which means no radiators that are larger than 140 it means no SSDs and it also limits your GPU compatibility depending on the power supply length and the cables exiting at the bottom so you have about 8 inches for GPU clearance with this type of power supply unless you're going with something really short that would allow for the GPU to span across so recommend the power supply length is 140 millimeters that would allow you to span a GPU at the bottom now I'm sure many people will be interesting doing custom loops and here especially because you can mount a 280 millimeter radiator on the side which is awesome and having those Universal brackets and having that high flexibility allows you to position the braid either slightly higher so it does not interfere with your GPU or select a lower depending on where your power supply and SSD sit so flexibility is definitely there especially when you're dealing with something of so compact size that any additional millimeter or centimeter of clearance in either direction is definitely going to be helpful and with a 280 rad installed it does block the rear fan mount which is unfortunate but it's kind of cool to see this type of hardware support in such a tight compact enclosure the one thing that threw me off completely Ito are the screws which are not magnetic so they completely fall out and they don't attach to your screwdriver so just keep that in mind as for those filtration there's one large filter on the side that can be moved to the other side because it is magnetic so that would depend on your hardware configuration and also top and the bottom are also covered the earth sandwich between two acrylic pieces one thinner at the top that can bend easier so you have to kind of press it from the inside so it bends and the clips pop out but as I was doing it I guess I was not doing it the right way but the little low beam on both the front and the back snapped now my initial idea for the system swap was to keep all my components the same but unfortunately the dot 2 is thinner so the CPU height our clearance is lower so in this case I can you know fit the dark rock 3 no problem or s with the dot - it's not gonna fit I can only fit 145 millimeters for the CPU tower clearance so my next choice was to go with this knocked or 9l it's pretty beefy but I'm oral clocking my 8600K which is why I've decided to just go all-in in terms of coolant compatibility inside of that too and just stick without maximum 280 million radiator support with the X62 from NZXT and it's definitely going to be tighten them especially my tight neck speed but because I'm using an XFX L power supply it is thinner so there's plenty of space inside the case hopefully for all the components as they advertise and I think right now we should start with the assembly process and during the assembly I noticed that one of the motherboard standoffs was misaligned to the motherboard itself and that kind of highlights the nature of the modularity of these Universal brackets because using a hex screw which is not included by the way I was able to loosen it up a bit and realign the Universal bracket to the motherboard and I was on my way the cool thing about this enclosure as well is that you can invert the motherboard layout so removing the screws in the back and rotating that plate and also relocating the universal brackets to the other side for motherboard mounting so you can have an inverted motherboard layout and so here is my system installed without the radiator for now so you can see the guts of the build everything is fine it is very tight near the power supply area I am using an SFX L power supply there's 140 millimeters in length but because of the modular cables add like additional two centimeters in there and it does press on the GPU at the backside which is you know it's it's fine but you can see the GPU is slightly angled because of it the one thing to keep in mind is that power cord extension right in the center of the motherboard the good thing is it does not interfere with the GPU but it might interfere with like a wider CPU tower so just keep that in mind it's not an ITX case if it's not a challenging build so I was almost finished everything is routed my GPUs installed my drives are in there as if I power supply but as I was about to mount my 280 rather than there I realized that I have to diverge from that original plan not because the actual radiator doesn't fit everything is fine but the tubing interferes with the SSDs because this is exactly where the tubing exits now the thing is I could remove the SSDs but because they are kind of in the same bracket as the power supply I have to redo my entire wiring remove this bracket via you know these clips over here and that's just not convenient so instead of redoing that entire thing let's just populate a slightly smaller 240 rad on the side and that should fit because I have a bit more high clearance so I can maneuver those tubing where it exits in this section over here instead of to being like really high up on top here and after swapping out the 280 rad for 240 rad I still was not able to mount the tubing exiting from the front near the SSDs because they just interfered over there unless I remove the SSDs but I was still able to mount it with the radiator and tubing near the backside and because the tubes here are much shorter versus what I had on the X 60 tube they they can bend no problem as long as you rotate the block accordingly so the tubes are exiting in the appropriate position now just to be the biggest troll I was going to populate a bunch of RGB hardware inside because in the manual which is awesome by the way they say RGB lighting seriously No so I was going to install these two Thermaltake ring fans because their RGB is absolutely gorgeous on both sides and because this perforation panel you'll definitely be able to see some that shine right through but the problem however are the cables and the cable here so long that I was worried that you know it would just cause me a lot more trouble in terms of routing everything and especially because these fans have their own hub which is awesome for an ATX enclosure or something bigger but when we're dealing with something this compact these really didn't fit I was also going to mount the leonie streamer cables which is that 24 RGB cable which looks fantastic and also would deliver that beautiful RGB spill on the interior but the 24 pin cable is just so close to my power supply that there's absolutely no way I was able to route that RGB cable and so the only RGB component I've settled with was the team group Excalibur Ram because it is absolutely gorgeous with that RGB stuff I can control it with my Asus software and it's running it super fast 3,600 megahertz and streak ohm is going to be releasing an additional TG panel so if you are after that beautification element of your interior components the TG panel will suit that type of RGB direction nicely now as for cooling performance of course having that raid leader inside the enclosure and all those components being in close proximity of each other and not having that much airflow to breathe is a significant hit on cooling over 10 degrees Celsius versus when the radiator is outside the case but still I'm getting better temperatures versus what I was getting on the a1 with an air cooler so I'm pretty happy and so when it's all said and done you know I'm gonna tie back to my original point of that working with any ITX case introduces its own set of challenges and data to my main sort of critique is with the mounting of the SSDs on a drive bracket because that bracket is attached to the other bracket for the power supply and then let's say removing one of the SSDs requires you to remove that entire thing and that's just a lot of work for simple swap of drives and that could be mitigated by using one of the universal brackets potentially for your drives instead of using the drive bracket that is attached to the power supply bracket and you kind of have to plan your build accordingly in case like if you have to replace one of the components what is gonna be needed to be removed first as well but you know many people prioritize on one the case looks like inside your space and it looks absolutely gorgeous it's a elegant system and it looks awesome in my space it's not too big it still packs in the 8600K a nice cooler Titan XP you know lots of ram in there lots of SSD storage and that is exactly what you would expect from an ITX system that is targeted for these like enthusiast builds I still miss my regular USB ports in the front you know it looks awesome here but I am never going to use it because actually I probably will have to buy a dongle and I will say that having the radiator exhausting air from this left side is awesome for winter because I can feel the warm air but that is one good alternative to having the inverted motherboard layout if you want to have the exhaust on the other side and looking back in the entire assembly procedure I wish that that interior frame was able to just come off from the aluminum shell that is outside giving you so many more access points for cables and working that isn't so claustrophobic feeling when you're looking at tiny little shell and access you know from both sides but having access from the top and bottom as well would be so much more convenient the New Mk2 Corsair strafe and k70 keyboards are fully loaded with custom illumination convenient media buttons USB pass-through extra set of key camps and economic rest rest for each keyboard so you can type or game comfortably with a variety of MX switches available so you can check out which keyboard suits you best in the description below and so that is it for my system for now I am doing a dual build very soon so stay tuned for that but for now let me know what you think of the streak of the two if it's something that you guys are interested in and yes it is an expensive enclosure that's challenging to build but the priority here I'm guessing would be that flexibility of mounting your hardware as long as you know how to approach it and what type of you know components you'll be using most likely just avoid any SSDs just stick with and the two drives SFX or SFX L power supplies but yeah let me know what you think of this entire building experience I'm Dimitri thanks so much for watching make sure to

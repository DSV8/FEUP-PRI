    "transcript": "This is my stovetop. Its a glass-top radiantelectric stove and if youve ever used one of these, you might have noticed somethinginteresting about its behavior. The heating elements quickly begin to glow once switched on and you can feel the intense heat coming from them right away. but when you turn the control knobdown to, say, medium power - the element simply goes out. Its not still running but at half-power,its just off. But then, before too long, it comes back on then switches back off. This pulsingbehavior endlessly repeats. Whats causing that? The answer is this funky component calledan infinite switch, also known by the much, MUCH better name Simmerstat. It may not look like much, but each heating element in the cooktop is wired to one of these things, and the simmerstatsare responsible for that pulsing. Let me show you - through the magic of buying two of them, andsome other stuff, Ive built this little box so I can control anything with a simmerstat. Illplug in a lamp to make what its doing obvious in addition to a mystery load on the other outlet which isnt important right now. Let me just stick on a control knob. Thats better. Set to high, thesimmerstat doesnt interrupt power flowing through it at all, but when you move it off of the highestpower setting, eventually power cuts out. However, the interruption is pretty brief. Eventually, power returns. Theseperiodic interruptions will repeat indefinitely, but as you turn the control knob further clockwise, eachinterruption increases in length. Once you reach the medium setting, it will eventually settle into a point where it spends roughly equaltime on and off. And then the trend will continue - if you go further, it only operates in brief pulsesand those pulses get farther and farther apart. The reason the simmerstat behaves likethis is because This is kind of the only option. Electrically, the heating elements in aconventional electric stove are merely resistors, a very simple component. But those resistors are huge! Eachone in this stovetop is capable of outputting at least 1,200 watts and the larger ones pump outthree kilowatts. Thats great for boiling water, but way too much power for more gentile cookingtasks like, oh, whats a good example, Oh! A simmer. To allow for that, we have to tame them and reducetheir power output. But how would you do that? You might think of adding a second resistorin series with the cooktop element, maybe even a variable resistor. but at these power levels, that theoreticalresistor would have to be gigantic and as it restricted current flow it would generate quite alot of heat of its own which is both wasteful energy-wise and would require cooling. So instead you might wantto use a variable transformer such as a variac to produce a range of voltages to choose from - lower the voltage and you lower the power consumed by those heating elements. But there we have asimilar problem: to handle this much power, that variable transformer would have to be quite large and thus quite expensive, and remember youll need four. So,to allow for fine control over the power output of the heating elements withminimal energy losses and component costs, the simmerstat was born. This device producesany arbitrary power level by repeatedly switching its load on and off for varying periods oftime, a method known as duty-cycle control. Before I explain whats going on inside here,though, I want to point out that these things arent by any means a recent development. In fact, the tech is quite old. Coil-top stoves going back to the 1940s use these sameexact controls to modulate their power output. As a matter of fact, the tech just had its100th birthday. The first place I found it described is in this 1924 patent for Chester IHalls invention assigned to General Electric. Coil-style heating elements like this arealso just giant resistors, so just as with the glass-top stoves which came later, the simmerstat was the most cost-effective way to regulate their output. That means coil-topstoves are exhibiting this pulsing behavior, too. However you generally arent aware of this happening with a coil-top stove because you cant see it. The heat produced by these coils is generatedby a thin wire element embedded in the center of the hollow metal tube which actually forms the coil. But the gap between the wire that produce heat and the walls of the tube is filled with a sand-like material. The sand fills the tube so it can be bent into different shapes with the wire inside staying centered, whichkeeps you from getting electric shocks. Which is pretty nice. But to get the heat produced by thewire element out of the tube and into cookware, it must make its way to the outer surface, meaning it also has to warm up all the sand in the way which is a lot of thermal mass. The upshot is that it takes a long time for these elements to get hot enough to visibly glow, so the pulsingbehavior of the simmerstat is visibly obscured. The elements below a glass-top stove are very,very different though. If I explained them would that be a tangent? Well its not directly related tosimmerstats so I suppose it would be, but too bad - I bought this so we gotta discuss it (I expensedit). This heating element assembly is whats actually under the glass of many glass-top radiantelectric stoves. Its incredibly simple, just a flat disc of heat-resistant support material hosting a very long zig-zaggy piece of nichrome wire. Actually, two - this is a selectable sizeburner just like this one on my stove at home, composed of a six-inch inner-section and anouter ring to fill it out to the whole 9 inch diameter for larger cookware. Theyre not all madeexactly like this, sometimes the heating elements are structured a little differently, but they allwork the same way: when voltage is applied across the nichrome wires, they get very hot very quicklyto the point of glowing brightly. That speed is the main functional advantage of a glass-topstove: near instant heat output from cold. But youll notice that in open-air this looksvery bright and orangey like the heating elements of a toaster. Thats because, well, thatspretty much what these are! But, you say, under the glass of a stove these appear a deepcherry red when operating. Why is that? Well, this glass is in fact a special ceramic material with some very peculiar characteristics. Its deliberately very bad at conducting heat energythrough itself which keeps other areas of the stovetop cool to the touch even when parts rightnext to it are hot enough to melt lead. But the glass lets infrared radiation pass right throughit almost completely unimpeded. Thats what allows the radiant heat produced by the heating elementsunder the glass to make it into your cookware, and why you can feel intense heat coming fromthem right away once they're switched on. The deep red color seen through the glass is the resultof filtering: the glass is opaque to almost all wavelengths of visible light, making itappear black to our eyes. But since it passes infrared light just fine, the near-infraredfrequencies at the very edge of the visible spectrum will escape that filtering andyou can see them. Pretty wild, right? And if youve ever noticed the probe thing goingacross the center of one of these burners and wondered what its for, well two things,actually: this is a sensing probe for two thermostatic switches in this little remoteenclosure. The first of those switches is very sensitive and closes its contacts in thepresence of minimal heat to illuminate the hot surface indicator (or indicators) to warn you thatthe cooktop is still hot. Count your blessings if you get a separate light for each burner, moreoften than not theyre all wired in parallel so any one of them can light up just a singlewarning light. Those cost-cutting cost-cutters. But the other switch in here is wiredin series with the heating element itself. Remember that this flat discof searing heat is trapped below glass, and while that glass is transparent to infrared, its not perfectly transparent so it will absorb some heat energy and get quite hot. Plus, evenif it were perfectly transparent to infrared, theres gonna be a piece of cookwareon top of the glass which reflects some of the heat energy right back down and into the element. Therefore, tremendous heat builds up in the tiny little sliver of air space between the glass and the bottom of this infernal frisbee. To protect theglass from getting too hot, the temperature probe will open a safety switch to remove power from theheating element and keep things from getting all melty. It usually resets in a matter of a fewseconds, but will kill power again if it needs to in order to enforce a high temperature safetylimit. This usually only occurs if the burner has been in continuous use at full power for severalminutes, such as when bringing water to a boil. Anyway, this video is supposed to be about thesimmerstat. But, before we talk ab - no Im kidding. Earlier I said that these modulate the poweroutput of the cooktop burners using duty cycle control. If that doesnt mean anything to you, thats just a way to say the percentage of time spent powered over an average. Imagine you havea 1,200 watt burner unit but you only need 600 watts of output for whatever particular cookingtask youre doing. Well, If you run that burner with a 50% duty cycle, perhaps by running it for5 seconds of every 10 second period, then although the actual heat output will be alternating betweenzero and 1,200W, over time the effective heat output is the full power multiplied by the dutycycle - in this case, 1,200 X .5, or 600 watts. Those of you who are more digitally minded mightbe thinking about pulse-width modulation just now. Duty cycle control and PWM are quitesimilar when it comes to their net effect of producing a lower average power output by cycling a whatever on and off repeatedly, but the two terms technically describedifferent things. Some might choose to argue with me on that, but PWM isnt necessarilytrying to modulate the power output of anything. In fact it can be used as a signaling protocol forfairly complex tasks. Servo motors, for instance, are sometimes controlled through PWM signaling. The length of the pulses they receive encodes a position for it to assume. When you are using PWMsimply to modulate power output, say when you use a PWM dimmer to reduce the intensity of DC-poweredLEDs, strictly speaking that is still duty cycle control: the apparent brightness of the LEDsis determined by what percentage of time they spend on vs. off, which is literally just anotherway to say their duty cycle. Pulse width modulation in that context is simply a modern means tothe end of attaining duty cycle control, with the added benefit of high switching frequencies providing it with some functional advantages. But since the simmerstat is literally 100-year-oldtech, well there aint anything modern in here. Yet it absolutely is a fully-functional, fully-capable duty-cycle controller. How on Earth could that be? Well, lets lookinside the simmerstat to see whats going on. That, uh... that is less clear than youdthink. So first, because were- I'm gonna turn this off now. Because we're dealing with the US split-phase electrical system here, inthe 240V circuit this is used to control there are two hot wires and no neutral. The heatingelements of a cooktop are wired across line one and line two just like any other 240V device. You can learn more about that in this video if you'd like. Because of this fact, this devicehas two switch contacts in it, here and here, so that it can open both sides of the circuit when switched off and completely isolate the heating element from voltage. That makes the simmerstatat its core a double-pole single-throw switch. Now the left side of the simmerstat doesnt actually matter at all for its power modulation purpose. Thats reallyjust an extra isolation point breaking line 1, and its only ever open when the controlknob is in the off position. In all other positions its closed. Oh, and this extracopper piece here is used to send power out to a pilot light to indicate that acooktop burner is switched on. Thats why the terminal on the back is labeled P and why they didnt bother giving it a proper contact surface - its just sending a tiny little amountof current to a neon indicator like this one. Youll notice, though, that the right side of the simmerstat features a much more robust pair of switch contacts, one of which is attachedto a wide copper bar. This is the contact that regularly opens and closes to modulate poweroutput. Uh, to hopefully avoid confusion, remember that you only have to break oneside of a circuit to kill current flow. When the other switch is closed but this one is open the heating element will still have 120V potential on it from line 1 but there isn'ta complete circuit to line 2 for any power to actually flow through it. Except the pilot light - wellthe pilot light is only operating at 120V and the other side of it is connected to neutral so thatstays on no matter what cooktop burner is doing. Im very sorry our power system is weird. Justignore everything on the left. It doesnt matter. Moving on, if we look at the backside of thecopper bar hosting our main switch contact well see something that looks an awful lot likea bimetallic strip. Because it is. These little heroes show up in the darndest places. Whys itin here? Well, this copper bar carries the current flowing through to the cooktop heating elementwhen the switch contact is closed and power is flowing. And theres a small amount of electrical resistance across the copper bar - its too small to measure with a multimeter but its enough to produce a bit of heat when the 10 or 11 amps drawn by the cooktop burner flows through it. Bimetallicstrips deform when they change in temperature, and since there's one attached to this copperbar which weve just established gets warm when current flows through it, the bimetallicstrip will start to bend as that happens. Now, unfortunately I cant really demonstratethis well in-circuit. Youll see why in just a moment. What I can do, though, is usethis little heat gun and show you what happens when the support bar warms up. Itspretty subtle, so watch closely. When hot, the copper bar bends such that the bottom switch contact moves deeper into the simmerstat body and farther away from its partner above. Now, think about what that means. If the copper bar warms up whenever the switch is closed and power is flowing, and that warmth causes the bar to bend such that the switch will open, then the switch does not want to stay closed. Any time it is closed, it heats upand the bimetallic strip then tries to open it. In practice, it looks like this. From belowwe cant see the switch contacts but we can see the copper bar moving back and forth everso slightly. Every time the switch is closed and power flows to the load, the copperbar begins to warm up because of internalresistance. We can see this quite clearlywith the thermal camera. As that happens, the bimetallic strip bends the bar such that the lower contact begins moving closer to the camera and away from its partner. Eventuallythe strip bends far enough to break the circuit, so current stops flowing. Once it does,though, the bar rapidly begins to cool down. That causes it to reverse course and start moving closer to the other switch contact, then they actually touch, current can flow again, the bar warms up, and the cycle repeats. And now, lets see if you make a TechnologyConnection. I'm using a lamp right now plugged into the simmerstat. And that lamp, because of the simmerstat, is flashing. Ive covered a certain other piece of tech which we use to make lamps flash in the past. Thatpiece of tech is put in-series with the lamps its meant to flash. Current flowing through itwould cause a switch inside to briefly open then shut repeatedly. Im speaking, of course, aboutthe turn signal flasher. These old-school thermal flashers also work thanks to a bimetallicstrip. That strip will deform when heated and open or close a switch (depending on thedesign particulars) which repeatedly applies and removes power to the incandescent lamps which form the turn signals tomake them flash and thus more noticeable. Now that behavior is certainly agreat deal faster than the pulsing the simmerstat is doing right now but its not reallyany different, is it? Its the same thing, just sped up. And at its core, this simmerstatreally is just an overgrown turn signal flasher capable of handling up to 11 amps of current at240V, or 2600W. But the simmerstat is a flasher with a twist - uh, literally. The turn signalflasher has a fixed duty cycle and behavior, at least when controlling the same loadat the same voltage. But the simmerstat can adjust its duty cycle based on the position of the control knob. Why? And how? Y'know, in Britain they call cooktop burnershobs. Does that mean that this is a hob knob? Anyway, when we were looking at this from above, you mighthave noticed that the switch contacts were nowhere near each other. Theyre clearly sprung such that they default to the open position, so what closes those switches in the first place? To find out,lets switch to the Cam Cam. Offenbach plays out of nowhere Its this cam! I dont know how I live with me either. Thecontrol knob of the simmerstat is attached via a shaft to this plastic cam covered ina copious amount of grease. When assembled, the cam presses down on these protrusions once rotated out of the off position, and that is what closes the switch contacts. Youll notice thecam has two sections with different profiles - the inner section presses on and closes the switch on the left of the simmerstat which remember, doesn't matter. Its just a safety switch. But the outer section, which engages with bimetallic switch, has a very subtle rampbuilt into it. Can you see that? This is the off position which doesnt press on the switchat all. But just to the left of that position, the cam profile gets very tall. That meansit presses the switch down quite far. But then theres a fairly steep dropoff before thecam very subtly gets thinner and thinner all the way back to the off position. Can you figureout why that might be? Vote now on your phones. What that varying cam profile actually doesas you turn the knob is change the resting position of the two switch contacts in the bimetallic switch. You cansee from below that as I turn it, the copper bar and bimetallic strip are moving up and down veryslightly. This might seem pretty inconsequential, but that right there is actually the key to thiswhole device. But explaining why... is complicated. Ive been stuck on this script for a while because although this component is incredibly simple, there are three connected concepts all working together here to make this what it is, and that makes it hard to explain withoutgetting stuck in a loop. But Ill try. Lets revisit that footage from earlier. Here,the simmerstat was set to medium and I let it stabilize. In this condition, the switch isclosed for about 5 seconds before it opens, and then it stays open for about 5 seconds, and thisrepeats. Thats how we get a 50% duty cycle. But why precisely is the switch opening andclosing with such predictability? To find out, lets look at the thermal camera again. Youll notice that at this setting, the contacts support bar seems topeak right near 100 degrees Celsius, then the temperature begins to fall. We thensee that it consistently bottoms out right near 78 degrees Celsius and it begins to riseagain. This tells us that the switch is actually opening and closing based upon the temperatureof the support bar and its bimetallic strip. Simple enough, but why, though? Why is thecircuit opening and closing at those specific temperatures? Well, thats because of this cam and how far its pushing down on the top switch contact. Remember that the bottom switch contact retreats into the body of the simmerstat as it warms up. How far that contact actually moves isa function of the temperature of the bimetallic strip in the support bar. And through the positionof the cam and its profile, we have chosen to place the top switch contact at some specific pointalong that deflection path. In this position, the contacts are forced to stay together untilthe copper bar has reached 100 degrees Celsius. At that precise temperature, the deflection of the bar is sufficient to open the switch. So really, the core function of this device... is a thermostat. Through turning the knob, were deciding how hot we want to allow that copper bar to get before it switches off the cooktop burner. So, the last piece of the puzzle ishow that choice becomes a consistent duty cycle. Because remember, the goal ofthis device is not to maintain a specific temperature like the thermostat in an oven, butto maintain a specific duty cycle and thus power output for the cooktop burners. Yet somehow were doing that with whatostensibly is a thermostat. Well, heres where I hope it all comes together. Remember thatthe copper bar inside here is both a thermostatic switch AND a heater. Whenever the switch is closed, itdissipates a consistent amount of power and that generates a consistent amount of heat withinthe bar. And like all heat-producing things, with a consistent power output howhot it actually gets and thus how far the bar will deflect is a function of howlong that heater runs in a given period. And now physics becomes our friend. Lets say I changethe knobs position to that of medium-high. What that will actually do is press down farther onthe top switch contact to force the two contacts to remain together until the lower support barhas reached 130 degrees. So, lets do that. The temperature of the bar, since power is now flowingthrough it, is climbing. But youll notice that the rate of change in temperature is slowing down asit continues to increase. Whats happening here is the result of the fact that the bar is approachingthe limit to how hot it can possibly become before the heat it gains through its internal resistance matches the heat that leaves through radiation to the air surrounding it. And as we approachthat limit, heat gain slows significantly. This means that it will take longer to reach thenew target temperature of 130 degrees, which in turn means that the switch contacts will stay closed for a longer period of time before they open again. And adding to that, the temperaturedifferential between the bar and the air around it is greater when its hotter whichmeans that once it stops being heated, its going to lose heat energy faster than it didbefore. That shortens the time the switch spends open before it closes again, though that effect isminor compared to the stretching of the on-time. But what about going in the other direction? What happens when you turn the knob to, say, medium-low? Well, with the knob at the nineoclock position, the cam is only very slightly pushing on the switch. Its pushing so gently thatthe bar only needs to hit about 60 degrees Celsius before it bends enough to open the switch. Sincethats much closer to ambient temperature than 130 or even just 100 degrees, it takes a veryshort time for it to reach that temperature when being heated by the current passing through. And youll notice that the switch only closes again when the bar drops to about 40 degreesCelsius - but it takes quite a while for the bar to cool to that temperature, so the pulsesit sends out are both short and infrequent. Do you see how this all fits together? We arereally controlling this circuit based on the temperature of the heater inside of it. Whencalibrated correctly, that can be used as a duty cycle controller. Because to get that heaterhotter, the heater itself must run with a longer duty cycle, so its average temperature becomes aneffective proxy for the duty cycle necessary to attain that temperature. And thats incrediblyfortuitous. Just calibrate the bimetallic bar to dissipate the right amount of heat when thecircuit is passing current, give the cam pressing on the switch a nice subtle ramp to allow you tobreak the circuit at a specific temperature of that bar, and you can produce any duty cycle you need with incredibly crude technology. But it gets even better! Because the switchingaction occurs based on the temperature of the bimetallic strip, theres a really helpful memoryeffect happening here. The main annoyance of using a conventional electric stove is the reactiontime. The thermal mass of the materials involved retain heat for a while, either the coil ofa coil-top stove or the glass of a glass-top. Thats useful because it helps smooth out theeffect of the pulsing behavior but it also means it takes a good while for the cooktop to react to a change in power level. The simmerstat cant solve that problem, but consider whathappens when you change the power level: If, say, you were on a medium-low heat but needed to move to a medium-high heat, then your turning of the knob is simplychanging how hot the internal heater needsto get before it cuts power. And if at themedium-low setting the heater was maintaining, lets say, 80 degrees on average, then when youchange the setting its gotta get all the way up to 130 degrees before it switches the elementoff. That means its going to produce a very long pulse of output and help the burnerget to your new target as quickly as possible. The same goes when you lower the output - if itsalready quite hot, then turning the knob will open the switch and it wont close again untilthe heater has fallen down to the new target, which is going to take a while. I firstnoticed this behavior of my glass-top stove and assumed that this was being accomplishedwith logic but nope! Thats just how this works! Now Ive left something important out. You mightwonder how the simmerstat can keep the element on at full-power when it's set to high. Well, thatswhat that really high point on the cam profile was for. That just really jams that switch down so itll never open no matter how hot the bar inside is getting. Pretty crude, huh? Except the crudeness doesnt stop there. This particular simmerstat only works correctly with fairly large heating elementsthat draw the 8.9 to 11 amps its rated for. Thats because how quickly the copper bar heats up depends on how much current passes through it. If you try and control a load outside of that range, things get out of whack. Through sheer dumb luck, this 1,100 watt hot plate draws about 9 ampsat 120V, so this simmerstat works correctly with it. The hotplate has been my mysteryload throughout the video. But if I plug in this smaller hotplate which only draws 900watts, the duty cycles this is meant to produce get all out of whack. And with a load muchsmaller than that, it never interrupts power. You also might have noticed that the way thisswitches the load is terrible! Switches ideally should have a snap-action to reduce arcing when they break electrical loads. This fella just doesnt. The contacts barely move despite switching 10 amps, and so some fairly nasty arcing occasionally happens. Its nottoo too bad because these are just used to switch resistive loads, and the overextension ofthe switch as the cam presses down produces a wiping effect that helps to clean thecontacts of carbon buildup and debris. Incidentally, that also happens inside the switches of an electromechanical pinball machine and yes part three is coming I havent forgottenabout it hold your horses! I just thought a script like this one would be faster. Why didI think that? I dont know. It never works! Anyway, before I end this video I want to makesure I say that not all simmerstats are going to function exactly like these ones do. For instance, thesimmerstats on my stove at home? Three of the four cant possibly use the current flowing through them to heat the bimetallic strip inside because they have selectable size elements. One even hasthree sizes. I suspect the core functionality of these simmerstats is exactly the same as this simple one, but theres probably a dedicatedresistor with its own path back to neutral producing the heat for the bimetallic strip, thatway the duty cycles are consistent regardless of the load they're controlling at any particular time. I also think it mightbe controlling a relay or, another possibility, the knob could actually be controlling a variableresistor producing differing amounts of heat to open a limit switch. I kinda think that might be the case becausethese have a definite click as they cycle on and off which this basic model doesnt. Thats just a guess,though - Im not tearing this apart. I need it. And by the way, I built this box for this video but Ive been wanting to build something like it for quite a while specifically because of thesecheap hotplates. If youve ever used one, you might have noticed that they are impossible to control! Thats because this knob is not controlling a simmerstat - its just a plain ol thermostat. Noticeit only clicks on when youre well away from the off position. You can kind make this work forwhat you need, but its incredibly hard because you dont even know where its measuring thetemperature and its going to change based on whatever cookware you're using Its a bit easier to controlthis style of hotplate where the heating element is embedded in a metal disc and its averagetemperature kind of means something, but this coil style is flat-out impossible to control witha thermostat. Im sure its just a lot cheaper than a proper simmerstat - I mean, these thingsare like $15. But its incredibly annoying and makes these pretty much only useful for boilingwater. I thought I was going to end up building, like, an Arduino-based controller or something but it turns out you can just stick a simmerstat in a handy box and be done! I added the lights becauseit pleases me. The red one is the pilot light and the yellow one indicates power is flowing. Uh I will not show you how I made that work. And a final point: it could be argued thatwe really shouldnt be using these anymore. I mean, if you get an induction stove its not goingto have them, but dont get me started on the touch controls those often have - hey,note to appliance designers, nobody wants that! Just use knobs. Touch controls on a stove would be like taking away a cars turn signal stalks and forcing people to adapt to weird buttons for nogood reason at all. Anyway, what I mean by that is the simmerstat works great with coil-top stoves since these heating elements retain so much heat, but with glass-tops, where radiant heat is transmitted right through immediately, the switching frequency is arguably too slow. I dont often notice this, and to be honest Im not sure it actually matters, but when Im frying up some veggies in a thinnerpiece of cookware, I can tell when the element is running and when its not. The sizzling gets alittle louder whenever its on and if theres any water in the bottom of the pan, it bubbles morevigorously. Again, Im honestly unsure of how much that actually matters, but Im not a goodenough cook to pretend my opinion is any good. Anyway, with modern high-power solid-stateswitching components, cooktop burners could in theory be controlled with as much finesse asa dimmer switch provides. That would cost more, of course, but at this point Im not sure howmuch it would. I mean, induction stoves have some wild power-switching circuitry in them and theyre not very expensive anymore. Now, the main thing Id be worried about in this hypothetical is actually noise. These fellas make a fairly noticeably humming when theyre switched on, and adding somehigh-frequency switching to that mix could turn that hum into a weird ring. But hey, evenjust, like, a 1 Hz switching frequency would be a huge improvement over the simmerstats inmy stove at home. Something to think about. OK. Well, thats it! I think. Didnt imagine thisscript would get so out of hand. I mean its literally just a bimetallic strip in a box with a knob. But at this point,I dont know why Im surprised. Here - how bout we gey a taste of November in April? I think Im gonnamake something actually simple before the month is out. Can I rise to the challenge? Find out onthe next whatever. Whenever it happens. Bye. dutifully smooth jazz Ill plug in a lamp to make what itsdoing obvious in addition to the eahhhh The ans- [strange noises] However, the interruption is pretty brief. Eventually, power returns. [eventually stretches on] [laughs] This is gonna be harder to time thanI thought it was going to be Once you reach the medium setting, now - oh right, thats whats supposed to happen These periodic interruptions will repeatindefinitely, but as you continue to control the turn knob further clockwise [breaks into laughter] Earlier I said these modulate the power output of the cooktop burners (loud thud) that was loud! But to maintain a specissssffsfsfsfssfs You've heard of a flash in the pan, what about a flash below the pan? I think that joke needs a little more time in the oven, don't you? Half-baked at best. But hey, at least I made a meal out of it. Soup's on!",

    "transcript": "- Sponsored by tech21. I've tested it, I've talked to it, I've shot it, I've shot with it, I've even broken it. In fact, the only thing I didn't do with one of last years most important Android phones, was review it. (upbeat music) With OnePlus you're usually gonna end up talking about price so let's just get there. Even at it's discounted tag of 499, the 7T is too expensive, if what you want is affordability above all. At 399 Google's Pixel 3A is still the best value you can find in mobile, in the States. And to make things more confusing, OnePlus has also aggressively discounted it's 7Pro and if you live overseas of course, you have more affordable options from brands like Xiaomi, Realme and Honor. Here's the thing though, with the exception of the Pixel, I've picked the OnePlus 7T over all of those. No, not because of the specs, which are prestigious but ultimately overkill for most folks and no, not because of the looks, which, though distinguished are less flashy than I like. No, I'd recommend the 7T because it's one of the most cohesive and consistent smart phones you can get. The instant you pick it up, the thought that went into this thing becomes apparent. The glass is cool to the touch like metal, but the matte surface is almost soft, like a nice soft touch plastic. It's still brittle like glass though, stay tuned. Drop your thumb on the finger print center and it's startlingly fast, easily the best in a world of sluggish and unreliable under screen sensors. The OxygenOS launcher that flares into place next is as clean and snappy as it's always been. The 90 hertz refresh rate it's delivered in is something I admit I can't always notice but it's nice gravy on top of an already smooth server. Especially since it doesn't seem to impact the battery life, which for me, can last two days if I'm conservative. And thanks to warp charge, the recharge speeds are some of the fastest you can find. But still, as a man with one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine wireless chargers between home and work and a phone inventory that mostly supports Qi charging, the fact that this phone doesn't is frankly just ridiculous. You don't need nine chargers, you just need enough to get used to them. Whether at home or at the Starbucks down the street, or at your local airport. And every time you drop your otherwise awesome phone on top of one only to remember it's not compatible, you feel slided. I asked CEOP about this OnePlus shut off it's concept phone at CES and his answer was that wireless charging isn't fast or consistent enough. We've heard that before. But he also said that the company is indeed, working on it. The other low point of the OnePlus experience has always been the camera. But after five months of updates and some crucial education by fellow reviewer, Danny Winget, I'm much happier with this triple shooter that I was at launch. First, let's me crystal clear, if you're buying a value phone for the camera, there's still no better choice than the Pixel 3A from Google, presumably the 4A when and if it launches. And, I know you've heard this one before, don't buy a piece of technology based on promises about tomorrow, buy it for what it can do today. Back in September OnePlus promised the 7T would get two features not included at launch. 4k video on the ultra wide camera and super slow motion. It's delivered on the former, thank you. But not the later. Not yet. And while we're talking about video, let's learn something about why samples from this phone and some others, look so bad when you take 'em off the phone. Danny. - What's up everybody, this is Danny and today I want to explain why your OnePlus 7T Pro video looks like this when you're playing it back on your device but then when you share it or you take it off and play it on your computer, it looks like this. The colors are jacked. There's a much more in-depth explanation for this but basically what's happening is that the OnePlus 7T shoots HDR video like many other flagship phones do, capturing more colors in the wider Rec. 2020 color space and unlike Samsung and some other manufacturers, OnePlus is not converting this video back into the Rec. 709 colors, when it's being exported. So it's not the camera sensor, it's not the processor, it's basically just software processing. In fact, I can just put this into Final Cut Pro and convert it back into Rec. 709 color space and whoa, it's so much better, I look like a normal human being again, saturation looks better, everything looks better. So it can definitely be fixed by software. This conversion in fact, already happens on the phone, that's why when you play it back on the device, it looks so good, it just needs to happen on the final file that you can export to view on your computer. But OnePlus is not the only manufacturer that does this, LG actually does the exact same thing so if you notice their video, same qualities and just up until now, Huawei was doing this too. Okay so enough of this, let's go back to the handsome guy. - [Michael] Ah I didn't just have Danny on for the compliments, this guy knows camera science better than I ever will. So be sure to give him a follow while you take in some weirder than usual Brooklyn scenery that I shot on exercise walks during the COVID-19 quarantine of 2020. (upbeat music) Now I sure wish OnePlus did the proper color conversion itself because for a user who doesn't wanna do the conversion work, the end result is gonna be the same screwed up colors when they go to share a video. Hopefully Google will provide some guidance on this to Android manufacturers going forward. Wrapping up the camera, it's nice that you have the option to make use of the wide angle shooter as a macroland for super close ups, even though the focus is still kinda dodgy. And the very tricky to get right night mode has improved significantly, thanks to updates. I'd still take a Pixel for the fire and forget reliability. But on the whole the 7T has a camera that I think most folks would appreciate and enjoy. (upbeat music) My final thoughts on the phone including a bug I never would have noticed, well not for that quarantine life, after this. How'd I break that first 7T? Well I dropped it off a bed. Bam, shatter town, USA. If you're similarly inapt at existence, consider a case from my sponsor tech21. They've got the best drop protection you could ask for. They're made from plant based materials and there's anti microbial protection built in to the case itself. Plus you can swap out the button colors. Fun. Save 10% when you click the link in the description below and use code mrmobile10. If you watched my recent video called Mr Mobile Stays Home, you'll remember that I urged you to call your friends and family to catch up during some of the free time you might now have. Now if you don't make those calls on a star fleet communicator, you might notice that the 7T isn't great at knowing that it's touching your face. See most phones use an infrared light to determine when they're against your cheek so they can turn off the screen. The 7T tries to figure that out through software instead. Usually it's okay but if you throw it a curve ball, like cradling your phone against your shoulder while you're doing the laundry, well get ready to accidentally mute yourself or hang up a lot. So if you don't want to or can't keep your phone firmly in hand during voice calls, use the speaker, or Bluetooth. Both of those are excellent. And on the whole, so is the phone. And listen, by most accounts the next generation OnePlus is probably just around the corner so I'd wait for that sequel to drop because I think this phone's price probably will too. But looking back on nearly half a year of on again, off again usage, the OnePlus 7T is one of the easiest Android recommendations I can make. And even if you tuned out before that bit about waiting for the price drop and bought it for the full 499 instead, oh, there are many worse mistakes you could make. The OnePlus 7T is a smart phone that will probably make you very happy. (upbeat music) Thanks again to Danny Winget for taking the time to teach us a lesson, you should subscribe if you don't already and if you'd like to see more reviews like this one, subscribe to the MrMobile on YouTube. Disclosure, I don't produce paid reviews. While OnePlus provided two review samples for this video, one of which I broke, the company did not afford compensation or receive an early copy of this review. They're seeing it for the first time, right alongside you. Until next time, thanks for watching and stay mobile my friends.",

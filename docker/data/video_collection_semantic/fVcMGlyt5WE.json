    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine, and I am so excited because I'm working on a series of three videos. They are gonna be shot stereoscopically, and we're using the ZCam which shoots 5.7k. This is actually a 3D video, and it's also 180 if you happen to be watching without a headset. To get this whole project edited we needed a really powerful PC, something that was powerful enough to run a VR software and the ZCam software specifically. And I also selfishly wanted a new powerful PC for gaming. So right here we have the ORIGIN PC MILLENNIUM and what's really exciting about this is it's running at limited edition Intel i9 processor. And it also comes in a crate, which is something that's very interesting to me because we have to figure out how to open it. (Justine groaning) So if there is one thing that I do have is a lot of will and a lot of knives. Bigger knives. (gentle upbeat music) Oh. Holy crap, that's heavy! I've never used a chainsaw before in my life. Let's open this thing up. (tools thudding) I feel like I need some eye protection, 'cause this could get very dangerous. (playful music) Somebody went shopping the hardware store. Me. The hardware store did not have a fitting room. This stinks. Did I buy these boots just for this? No, I actually bought it for my Halloween costume last year. (shoes squeaking) (laughs) Squeaky shoes. So I gotta put this one first. We might have a problem because if I can't figure out how to put on a safety helmet, I probably shouldn't use the chainsaw. Theirs doesn't look like mine. By the time I get my safety gear on there's gonna be be some sort of disaster. I don't know. I'm going to throw this thing across this garage. - Oh, look. See how it has the little feets? Yeah, exactly. - That's what I was doing. Here's the directions. - I got it. - We're following them. - Oh, look at this, look at that! Oh, hold the other, hmm. Oh, boy. So, okay. So let's see if this is gonna work 'cause now it's really tight. I think I'm on. And now we're ready for the unboxing. (gentle upbeat music) (tools clattering) (knife thudding) (flame thrower roaring) (dramatic music) Probably a very, very bad idea. (gentle upbeat music) Huh. (chainsaw whirring) Oh! (chuckles) (chainsaw whirring) I've never had more fun in my entire life than making this first cut. Pardon me throwing knife, mommy's got a job to do. (chainsaw whirring) We have a really big problem. I really enjoyed that, I think I enjoyed it way too much. I could do this all day. If anybody needs anything cut up you know where to find me. Let's open her up! (box crunching) This made way less mess than I thought it was gonna make. (box clattering) Here she is. Welcome home my precious child. I guess I could probably take off my safety gear now. Since we didn't use our throwing axes yet, great time to use them. These are so sharp. Oh my god, how do I get it outta here? I know that I'm making this more difficult than it needs to be. What did you do? What did you do? Oh man. (sighs) Got some power cables here. Some more accessories. Take that upstairs. But now let's do the unveiling. Dun du du, dun du du da Oh yeah, look at you. Oh, yes. Oh, man. You look great. Welcome home. We made it upstairs and obviously there's a lot of sounds happening. We've got the air conditioning running, we've got my server over here. But now we're gonna have a new machine to add to the mix. So let's spin this around and the first thing that you'll see right here is it says, \"This is not a lift point.\" So if you were to pick this up. (gasping) This magically comes off and this is where you have all of your USB ports. There's also at HDMI and ethernet. So this is where everything is secretly hidden. We gotta take out the packaging from inside of here, this is just magnetic. This is my dog's stick. Hey Maddy, come here, you wanna stick? Maddy, come here, see what I have for you. Hmm, weird, why is he not moving? I don't know. All right, Maddy. Let's take all this out (packaging rustling) (relaxed music) Okay. So now we're down on the floor here, with our new PC. So this hasn't unlocked, ninth gen, Intel Core i9-9900KS special edition processor. And this is one of the best gaming desktop processors from Intel, with up to five gigahertz, all core turbo and 16 threads of processing performance right out of the box. Or shall I say crate? We've got the MSI Z390 Gaming Edge AC motherboard. We have the eight gig Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080. We have 32 gigs of DDR4 RAM. We have a one terabyte Western Digital solid-state drive. And we also have a 12 terabyte mechanical hard drive. So now with all that being said let's set this thing up. I also ripped my pants. I can't imagine how that happened today. There's also some accessories in here that I need. An angled HDMI since you have to plug this in and put the cords through the top. Got a power cable. And I think that's all I need for the time being. Time to boot this thing up! (gentle upbeat music) (Justine gasping) There are so many LED lights in this thing. This is absolutely beautiful. Take a look at that. Hey, if you turn the lights off will you be able to see it? Hey Siri, turn off all my lights. I mean have you seen anything more beautiful? It's all booted up, I have one of the LG ultra wide monitors. What should I do should I do? Should I watch one of my own YouTube videos? Okay, well it looks like everything is set up. All of the drivers are installing, all of the Windows updates are happening as we speak. I plan on doing a bigger video talking more about this computer, my experience. I also wanna to redo this whole desk setup with all the Chroma pink Razor stuff that I have. It's gonna look amazing. Before we go back downstairs to show you how I actually took this out of the crate, just enjoy this beautiful machine in 3D VR. (gentle upbeat music) Spoiler alert, it actually is a chainsaw while the computers inside of it because that is absolutely not the proper way to do this. So I'm gonna open this the proper way and show you what I did before I destroyed the box. (dramatic music) (drill whirring) All we gotta do is take out a few screws! \"Caution, please follow the instructions below \"to safely unpack your system.\" (dramatic music) (drill whirring) Top is removed. (drill whirring) As a side note, always be careful with power tools. And do not try to open up your Origin PC create with the chainsaw, and if you do make sure the computer's not in it. All boxed up, ready to destroy. Thank you guys so much for watching this video. This was so much fun. And a huge thank you to Origin for sending me this new machine. And I hope you guys enjoyed this video. Look for a full set up tour and overview of this computer and where my new setup is. So with that, (drill whirring) I'll see you guys later. (drill whirring)",

    "transcript": "a teranz poslochaj dyskusji o prawdzimym dealu he's a real deal this picture and and that cannot listen I can go either way he can pitch all data can't pick your game what's up guys Lew here back with another video and today I'm going to be checking out what I'm told is a very special device from a company called oppo the unfamiliar with them they are a smartphone maker we've got some fairly sleek stuff that you may not have seen yet and i'm told that this is a fine example of such devices as you can see on the side here it is the r 7 + f the color is golden but let's get inside the box and let the product explain itself oh my goodness it is a box in a box it is the r7 plus FC barcelona edition which i am told it's fairly rare on the back we have a couple of specs got a six inch screen 13 megapixel rear camera 8 megapixel front how about this four thousand plus my lap hours what I love battery what is this leather looks like what here is the device my good oh wow options okay so you could do to sims or a sim and a microSD look at that FC barcelona official partner got the logo their speakers in this location here the fingerprint sensor is on the back as you can see the sort of where your index finger lines up cameras up here looks like a dual tone flash as well on the front of the device this giant 6-inch display speaker at the top forward facing camera around the sides SIM card tray / microSD Trey also got the power switching this location and then on the other side volume rocker top is where you'll find your headphone jack as well as what looks like a microphone and on the bottom micro USB for charging up the device now it does appear to have a screen protector installed i'm told that this is a glass screen protector I'd assume this is removable as well if for whatever reason you choose not to use it whoa that's an experience right there look at that and each of these little boxes has this leather like texture to it haven't really felt cardboard like that before trust me i felt a lot of cardboard and in ear style it looks like a fairly basic headset has a microphone as well the charger now this is a European device so you've got a European charger looks like it's quick charge to AG has just hit me with the data real quick five minutes of charging can provide you with two hours of phone calls now in this other box whoa more accessories micro USB cable substantial cable bayou city so a sim tool the nano SIM tray as well as a secondary sim tray or expansion for micro SD that right there should be implemented in all phones why not you don't have to have a secondary slot you're going to have to put a sim card in anyways so why not include storage expansion in that location as well why not so i told you about the 13 megapixel camera on the back you've also got a 8 megapixel camera on the front that's pretty substantial for a forward facing camera lastly we've got a case here so like we've seen from some other manufacturers they're giving you some protection if you choose to use it here's our first look at the display as well as the OS this one looks pretty good pretty sharp so for 1080p you can see the lock screen here it's like FC barcelona specific with the colors as well as the logo down here the device is very responsive you guys tell me apparently there's a little bit of a curve to the device obviously a huge consideration is the camera move so image stabilization on those photos as well as faster focusing the laser autofocus you've got ultra HD beautify make yourself more beautiful I should definitely try that one bunch of filters panorama HDR gift that's cool audio to go with a photo double exposure super macro raw get out of here let's try beautify here 0% beauty this is the way you're used to seeing me and then a hundred percent beauty what am I do it what ok and we kind of makes it look like I'm wearing a little bit of makeup to be honest with you from facing camera video as well as audio hello you're in the studio now you're on the rear facing camera watching me watch you watch me alright so there you have it the camera is pretty cool I don't know I haven't seen what it looks like on a bigger display yet but I think so far pretty impressive especially in the stills Department front-facing camera was surprising a beauty mode did its best to make me look pretty i'd like i'd like you to let me know in the comments whether you think that worked or not I should try out the fingerprint sensor real quick lock it whoo the idea here is like you're not hitting the switch at all you're just simply going right on the finger loop it's fast here is a success plus definitely heavier footprint wise basically identical as a trial song Jack put those tears away you guys get the point yeah i mean a decent speaker it's on the back of the device is not the perfect location it's loud enough does the job and hey if you buy this device you get that slick track included and it will bring a tear to Jack side every single time just keep that in mind alright guys that wraps up this video thank you very much for watching if you want more information on this device will have all the links down in the description that's it that wraps it up thanks very much for watching and I'll catch you on the next episode later",

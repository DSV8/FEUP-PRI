    "transcript": "so you receive an invitation that means play your choice of mouse is damn important since only you can satisfy it's time to XTRFY man XTRFY deserve some credit with this one the M4 RGB what an amazing entry into this very exciting yet competitive my segment this is now in my top three game mice in my entire Mouse collection because it fits my grip and play style perfectly we've all been there looking at our ram thinking what a weakling well no longer introducing tough frame by thermal take the toughest RAM around with a discrete built-in logo and premium heat spreaders design the toughest addressable LED system with super brightness compatibility with all the usual motherboard software even raise a chroma and voice control through Amazon Alexa available in the toughest capacities of 16 gigabytes per kit with speeds between 3040 400 megahertz considered the tough frame RGB link below alright so the price is bang-on at $59 for the black model and $5 extra for the other four color options with this retro style being my favorite I'm not sure how popular the blue and pink bottles will be and notice there is no glossy version available but hopefully this sets off a trend so we can see more fun color options in the future from other brands I do love the included key caps one grey GG and the other color matched piece with the extra fine through these are not DBT but I appreciate the value add the see-through shell is nothing new obviously the hole punch design gives us a 69 gram body that isn't the lightest on the block but the ergonomic advantage is what will sell this thing the ambient spill on the inside looks quite unique plus the extra fight text there's a nice Easter egg and the front LED illuminates the surface to having all five mice on hand let's be test for quality consistency as previous batches we're exhibiting a lot of creaking when you're flexing the body for the models are perfectly fine on line and only the retro style the one I'm using exhibits a lot of creaking it's the worst copy out of all five it seems the left button all mice has a bit of play while the right button stays put this doesn't affect gameplay in any way but it's still worth mentioning the cable is probably the weakest feature here the sleeve is not as flexible as the competition and there is a tiny thickness difference between the colors although it's nice that the cable is color matched to the body itself now the one thing that separates this Mouse versus everything else that people looked at is a completely driverless approach it's a true plug-and-play which is kind of refreshing and I don't care about creating macros on my mouse so you can cycle between a dpi profiles with the button at the bottom all are color-coded I play at 400 dpi so for me this is perfect you can change the polling rate with another slider at the bottom and you cycle between colors and effects with the button combo it's a true set-and-forget approach I appreciate the basics and the only thing that's missing here that would be normally found on my switch software is some form of surface tuning that lets you customize liftoff distance but here at the m4 does not jump around when it's being placed down on the surface after strong flick or being picked up around the mouse mat the liftoff distance is pretty low by default the feet are 100% PTFE or the replacement set included in the box the glide is smooth but not as good as the Razer viper or the model O and the reason why this thing is in my top three now is because of the shape it's like a more ergonomic and smaller rival 310 that I used for years love the curvature for the thumb and the right side is perfectly shaped to support my ring and pinky fingers the top hump is not too aggressive and it's well suited for my hybrid grip plus the more angular and lower front section is just more comfortable to grip versus the model o or the Razer Viper I also feel like you can claw this one easily the scroll wheel is awesome with grippy texture and lots of controlled muted scroll steps the primary triggers are crispy and fast side buttons are tactile with the soft ending but have more pre-travel than any of my other mice in my collection and combine all that with a performance sensor the 3389 we have a winning package that has been an absolute pleasure to game with it's because of this mouse I've been training more and getting back into csgo just feel more comfortable with spray control finding my targets flicking around and after a bit of hiatus it's nice to get back into shape with acceptable performance at least what I would consider to be acceptable so the extra fiim for RGB honestly surprised me I did not expect to like the shape so much I thought I'd be too small for me given its an Ergo Mouse but for my hand size it fits me perfectly the cable is the only weakness point here that could be slightly softer especially compared to the competition but with a bungee it's not a problem highly recommend this one thanks so much for watching check out links for all the mice in the description below including my top 5 I'll talk to you guys in the next week",

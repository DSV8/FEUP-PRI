    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine, and this video today is something that I have been waiting for I think my entire life. If you guys are fans of Lego and Nintendo, they have come together to basically, to make all of our childhood dreams come true! So I got a chance to do a Zoom call with Jonathan from Lego. And he had one of the starter kits and the Piranha Expansion Kits on his desk, and it's so cool, was so jealous! There's also one more expansion set. It's the Bowser's Castle Set. And this thing looks so great. I was trying to contain my excitement during the Zoom call. Bowser's Castle looks incredible! I know I may not have seem liked I was that excited. But I know that I was recording. And if talked then my little voice bubble would pop over top of what he was showing me. But it's so awesome! The pre-orders are starting very soon, if not already, depending upon when you watch this. The Starter Set will be out August 1st. And this is the Starter Kit, which comes with the little Digital Mario figures here. The other sets don't come with Mario. So you definitely need to have the Starter Kit. So that the Expansion Sets will work with the Starter Kit. But the Digital Mario, there's actually a lot of tech built into this little guy. So it has an accelerometer, a gyroscope. It has a little sensor in the bottom. Which is actually a little camera. He also has a build LED on the front, speakers, and Bluetooth. So with his little camera sensor, it determines what color bricks he's on. And that's how you get coins. He also reads different barcodes. So there's barcodes that are placed on various obstacles, like Goomba or the coin blocks. As you can see here, in this little video demo, that when he hits the blue bricks, his front little digital display reads as water. And then, when you put 'em on the red bricks. Yep, you guessed it: It's lava. You'll have 60 seconds to complete all of these courses to gather as many coins as possible. And you don't lose lives in this little Lego game. You lose time. So if you hit the water or the lava, for example, Mario will just kinda pause so you're not able to collect coins during that time. If you wanna use other Lego bricks to kinda build out these sets, this is super-exciting because you can also do that. So I'm sure many of us have extra bricks laying around. The color sensor though, only works with kinda the primary Lego colors. So any of the green, red, blue, or yellow bricks that you have. His color sensor will work with those, and you can still collect coins. This is really awesome, oh my gosh! So like how long has this been in development? Is the real question. - Been over four years. But we felt that when Lego and Nintendo would do something together, we needed to make it count, and we wanted to make it special. And also reinvent how kids play with Lego bricks, and how kids play with Mario. And that takes a little bit of time. - Mario has a built-in speaker, so you can hear the interactions and collecting coins. (Mario's bell chimes) - [Jonathan] Now you get five coins as well. Different enemies give different coins. The Cloud Pet for him, which is a personal favorite. - And the accelerometer Jarris built is kind of interesting. So using this little obstacle, this is a little cloud. You can transport Mario from one set to another. So if you wanna split up your sets in the room, you can take Mario on his little cloud, and be collecting coins all the way to the other side. - We put that in the Starter Set because we want kids to kind of use their whole room as levels. So now they can just build the start maybe on one side of the room, and then the finish on the other end. And then with the cloud, you'd fly between. - [Justine] That's cool. - [Jonathan] Most of these functions have like little secrets in them. - Jonathan did say that there's some secrets to collecting coins, but he wouldn't tell me what they were. - So the cloud actually has a secret to get a lot of coins from it, if you know exactly what to do. - So I guess we're just gonna figure that out for ourselves. Mario does have Bluetooth built-in, and there is a companion app. So you can connect the app to Mario. You'll be able to update him. And when you get expansion sets you be able to let him know that, \"Hey, guess what, Mario, hi, we've got some expansion sets.' So you will update him that way. And in the app, it also has instructions and different types of videos to help inspire your set building. But they don't have set instructions on how to build the sets. - Mario has a Bluetooth button. And it allows you to connect to like a companion app on their mobile file or tablet. And once you're all setup, you don't actually need the app to play because everything runs on Lego Mario. - I was surprised at the price. Because obviously, Lego sets are more on the expensive side. Especially for something so advanced like this. The Starter Set, including the digital Mario is $59.99. The Piranha Expansion Kit is $29.99. And that massive Bowser one is $99.99. I would love to hear from you guys though. What do you think about this? Are you excited? Is this something that you've been waiting your whole life for as well? Because I know I definitely have. Hopefully, I can get get one here soon to show you guys all how it works. But until then, I'm just gonna be sitting over here staying at home and playing Animal Crossing. Because I mean, what else do we have to do?",

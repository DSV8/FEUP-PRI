    "transcript": "recently I (accidentally) opened Microsoft Edge and was bewildered by the amount of terrible content Microsoft Stark tries to force down your throat a whole bunch of ads trying to catfish older men with Promises of sexy gutters but I also saw a bunch of ads promising to fix up my Windows PC and make it run better than ever which got me real interested to see what kind of tech tips people were getting from Microsoft Edge spam so I thought for today's video I'm going to lar as a 90-year-old and have my identity St on the [Music] internet now straight off the bat when you open up Microsoft Edge it looks like this which I don't even know if I can show a bunch of this stuff on the internet cuz it just it's a distillation of how unhinged the Internet is just first thing when you open up the browser but anyway this is the homepage and I did actually see some of the ads that I mentioned earlier about tuning up your PC on the homepage uh but it's not always there where it usually shows up is when you go over to gaming which starts off with an Amazon ad for airpod Replacements in between a bunch of like game rant articles which you know that's already way better than the homepage aside from the Amazon ads you scroll down a little bit and you get to this which says Windows users don't forget to do this before tomorrow with a picture presumably to help you identify whether whether or not you have a Windows PC if you click on it it takes you here millions of Windows users are keeping their PCS healthy using this one trick and don't worry it's free so place your bets now which you think this is an ad for but I'm not going to keep you in suspense for very long it's for total AV which is an antivirus software the article then explains that every minute you spend on the internet unprotected hackers are going to sell at least two of your grandchildren to the Albanian mafia and the best way to protect yourself from the ocean of skeletors on the Internet is with total AV for free and then with Terror successfully sewn it shows you a bunch of very legitimate looking badges proving that it's the best solution to these problems but when you Google it you type in total AV on a much better browser Firefox the third result below a couple of Google frequently asked questions which include is total a a legitimate company and why am I being charged for total AV is a Reddit Thread about victim of total AV how should I proceed and then when you go in it's a whole spiel about how this person got kind of screwed out of a bunch of money paying for total AV which is interesting because if you go back to the ad it talks about how total AV is free and it's a great way to keep your PC healthy for free they even have a whole bunch of uh documentation about their interactions with total av's um customer support and stuff and below that is a bunch more people people talking about bad experiences that they've had with total a uh so it is a real company but it's just not a very good one apparently the thing is though when you go back to Google and you scroll further down there are a bunch of websites that give total AV very good reviews so I don't know I feel like we're getting some mixed signals here uh so let's try it for oursel and see what happens when we claim our free copy here okay that makes sense it takes you straight to a download page with a whole bunch more glowing reviews and then after clicking the free download button it took quite a while to install but once it finished it immediately prompted us to scan our entire system and despite not finding any viruses it still prompted me to resolve issues and when you click on resolve issues uh it goes straight to you having to put in your credit card details so for total AV to actually do anything you have to sign up for a dollar a month build annually so you have to pay $20 now for the free software to work but the real problem happens a year later because when you sign up for a subscription by default it turns on auto renewal so a year later after you forgot about total AV it's going to subtract $120 from your account and there are a whole bunch of Reddit threads talking about how they make it super hard for you to cancel that subscription so basically the whole free tuneup ad is just an attempt to bait you into the hellscape that is their super difficult to get out of expensive yearly subscription plan but with that let's see what other valuable Tech tips we can get from Edge spam and after scrolling down through dozens more of that same total AV ad I stumbled onto this another ad that popped up which I think maybe by the same company yeah it's also on security tips which still has the the WordPress logo for the website it even says advertorial up here oh is that a real word that's gross if it is oh no it is real but this one goes a different angle it sells you an ad blocker which is pretty funny considering that it's an ad that brings you here we're already getting popups from Total a it's telling you that it's less than a $1.99 Which is less than a cup of coffee and then when you click on it it just takes you back to Total A's payment page what so basically all roads lead to Total AV when it comes to Microsoft start but apparently not all roads why Gamers over 40 keep this game a secret oh it's a rage Shadow Legends ad oh got baited into that one oh and then there's also this kind of article how to check if your computer is slowing down over time with a cute picture of a little turtle next to um a Macbook here but let's see what it says the premise of the article was how to identify if your computer's slowing down now that for example you filled it full of total AV a problem that it had a very interesting solution to its first hint is to once a week open up task manager and write down down what the utilization is of the various elements and then see if that number gets degradation but what does it mean about by degradation genuinely confused I reread the passage several times but couldn't figure out what they meant by degradation looking out for any kind of degradation implies that you're looking I guess for the the utilization numbers to go down and then that's bad but that's kind of like the opposite of how it works am I just stupid and like not reading this correctly or does this not give any information and then they just move on to the next point I I really feel like they need to give us more information than this because if you're just going to randomly once a week open task managers and write those numbers down you're not going to get any useful information from that like maybe one day you've got Chrome open with 17 tabs and the next week you do it you don't have have those tabs open and because the numbers are lower you're going to think your computer is broken like but it's just it's not at all how that works I'm so confused I then decided to just move on and in the next bit of the article they explained that performance monitor was much better than task manager because it could log the data over time the problem was just following the instructions verbatim didn't give enough information about how to get performance monitor up and running but luckily they had a solution for that problem performance monitor isn't the most userfriendly of tools they say explaining it in a very unuser friendly way so you might find it easier to keep your own records of task manager activity but luckily their in-depth guide was real in-depth so this is the guide where it shows you how to use the monitoring tools and it gives you stuff like application failures and stuff which you know fair enough this seems like a useful tool I'm sure there's a lot of people currently busy typing about how much they use this and then it goes onto Mac OS so it helps Apple users as well from what I can see here it's just telling you to run geekbench the idea is for you to run them regularly note down the scores and then chart the scores over time your performance drops so again their solution to figuring out if your PC slowing down over time is for you to keep an EXL spreadsheet of geekbench benchmarks over the lifetime of the PC let me know in the comment section down below if any of you do this in all fness to this article right it is giving you a bunch of information about how to test various things in your PC like how to Benchmark your your CPU and your storage and stuff which is fair enough you know that's a useful skill to have when interacting with a PC get your stopwatch out and time how long it takes for your computer to start up and shut down these processors are both good barometers of how healthy your Windows or Mac OS machine is and how much strain it's under I mean honestly like none of this is technically bad advice it's just really funny to me that I I can just imagine like an 80-year-old opening this website and just being completely bewildered by what's going going on here um of course you're going to have to do this over several days or weeks to spot if there I love how they always add that as well like no no no you have to do this over months otherwise this is useless to you uh once you've got a few data points built up though in a spreadsheet there comes the spreadsheet I knew they were going to bring up a spreadsheet at some point I just know how this video is going to go I'm going to spend this whole time making fun of performance Monitor and logging the results that you get from it in XL spreadsheet and I'm just going to get a whole bunch of it professionals being outraged at me making fun of it like that's what always happens with this I then found some more Tech tips which basically just explain the difference between powering your system off and sleep mode and that if you have a laptop you should occasionally turn it off which was very useful so at the end of the day I feel like we got some very useful Tech tips from Microsoft Edge I learned that I should get baited into spending way too much money on total AV and that once a week I should open my task manager and write down some of the numbers I see maybe include a stopwatch and finally if I have a laptop I should turn it off every now and then to help its battery life very useful stuff uh so with that let me know in the comment section down below what kind of spreadsheets of PC Vital Signs you've got going and until the next video thank you for watching bye-bye [Music] a [Music]",

    "transcript": "- Oh okay, okay, okay. I don't even know how to start this video. Oh my God, 64 gigs, like get out here, dude. (noise of finger tapping) They're both here. This is the new 16 inch MacBook pro and this is the new 14 inch MacBook pro. I have been waiting for a MacBook like this pretty much my entire life. Maybe not my entire life, that might be exaggerating a little bit, maybe, but for like the past couple of years. Ever since they removed the SD card slot, the SD card slot is back. We have three Thunderbolt 4 ports. we have frigging HDMI port. We even have, MagSafe. I don't even wanna talk anymore. I need to open these up, because I can't wait. Should I open them both at the same time? Cause I feel like I don't want to give one, more love than the other. We're gonna open them both at the same time. Okay. I can't pull it up. I'll just... Space Gray 14 inch and we have the silver 16 inch. Oh, whoa. Ohh. It really, this is crazy because it actually I'm oooh. It feels like the old school MacBooks. It's like the Mac is freaking back. (plastic covering crumbling) The bottom has the MacBook, like they have the MacBook Pro like they had it engraved. Oh Wow. Okay So here's the 16 inch. Oh my God, This will look beautiful. This is, it's heavy. I'm so used to that 13 inch. Wow. Like I can't, I actually cannot wait to work. (plastic cover falling) The MagSafe cable is braided. Oh shoot. Look at that, it's a braided cable. I wonder if the space gray, is it darker? No space gray cable, same color. Fricking MagSafe is back. Full size HDMI, a Thunderbolt 4, SD card slot. We've got our other two Thunderbolt 4 ports, we also have the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and our MagSafe. Hold on a second. I gotta, I gotta, I gotta do something. Oh yeah. That is satisfying. Oh, look at this... the brick is, it's not square anymore. This is like an elongated brick. Check it, check it. I also got one of the extension cables, because it's honestly one of the best purchases that I've ever made, because I hate plugging this into the wall. It always falls out, especially on flights. It just never really stays in. So this is the extension cable. So this just plugs right into the power brick. And will give you a much longer cable. This is the 140 Watt USB-C power adapter, that goes to our 16 inch, and 14 inch is still that square size. And this one is a 96 Watt charger. So you guys can see the size difference of both of those. So actually it's pretty significant. So with space gray, you get your black stickers. Let's see if stickers are white on, no actually both versions give you the black stickers. (mumbles) Cause Apple announced not only one, but two new chips. They have the M1 Max and the M1 Pro, both of those are going to be incredibly powerful. We'll talk a little bit more about the differences in those but honestly, I just want to open these up and that's really what I want to do. Like this is giving me such old school throwback vibes for some of the old Macbooks. (gentle music) Oh, look at this. Oh, instant freaking. (plastic being ripped off) Woa... I feel like I'm actually going to cry and I don't want to cry, but sometimes I can't control my emotions and this is one of those times. Look at this. I like that they changed the background for each of the size variants. So on the 14 inch, they felt like this little red background and on the 16, they have the blue. Now I'm like debating. Did I make the right choice on the size of the laptop that I got? Because for the past year I've been using the 13-inch MacBook and I got very used to that smaller screen size. So I ordered the completely spec-ed out MacBook Pro 16 inch. But this 14 is a very nice size and traveling with the 13 inch was so great because it was so much smaller. But look at this, this is thick, this is beefy. Editing on this is going to be your freaking dream. The keyboard is all new, it also looks so strange without the touch bar. It's like, it's naked here. It's like where did your, where did your clothes go? It's really fresh, super clean. So this is the base model, 14-inch MacBook pro. This has the 8 core M1 Pro Chip. It has 16 Gigs of Ram and 512 Gigs of storage. And this is going to run you about $2,000. That is the entry level, and this is still going to be so incredibly powerful. If you're looking to save some money, but still want to get one of these updated machines, this could be the way to go. I have been editing some incredibly processor intensive things over the past year on that 13-inch, M1 MacBook. I have pushed that thing to its absolute limits. So the fact that, this is an upgrade from that. I think a lot of people are gonna be incredibly surprised with this base model, But then on the other hand, we're over here, we've got the 16 inch, the Apple M1 Max chip with 64 Gigs of RAM. This has 4 TeraBytes of storage and this is the 10 core model. So there are various configurations that you guys can choose. Look how big these speakers are. Holy moly. Let's check out these ports. So over here we have our MagSafe, we've got our two Thunderbolt 4 ports. We've got our headphone jack and we have our a full-size HDMI out, which is so impressive. Another Thunderbolt 4 and our SD card slot. Mmm. You can see the hinge also looks very different than the previous version, and this bottom, like I love that MacBook Pro font, like that looks great. I'm actually kind of digging the silver. I had been going all space gray over the past couple of years, but the silver really is kind of that throwback because this is what the original MacBooks looked like. I like the rounded edges. There are going to be a lot of very happy Apple people when these start shipping. (Energetic Music Playing) I have been playing with the new MacBooks all weekend and I'm so excited. You guys may remember Nathan ... - Hello you've been in some of my videos before you know, we used to shoot a ton of stuff together. So I hit you up and I go, yo, I got, I know you've got some crispy 8K footage. - I do. - There it is. - Brought it with me. - So I'm so excited because I obviously edit a ton in Final Cut, but you've been editing recently in Resolve. - Yeah, I switched to Resolve like around version 15. - So what do you mostly shoot? - You know, I've been doing a lot of different things. Some corporate videos, some big commercials, some music videos, and then like some fun small scripted projects. - Nathan shoots at tons of crazy high quality stuff. So I was like, I know you've got some footage. Can you bring some over? And can you do a little workflow test to see how this new M1 MacBooks stands in comparison to like what you have been using. - And I have been on a 2018 fully loaded MacBook pro since 2018. I'm going from Intel to just the first interaction with an Apple chip. - Well, let's interact. (Energetic Music Playing) - [Nathan] Okay, is this it? - Dude, this is it. So this is the 16 inch. This has the M1 Max, and I also have the 14 inch here. And honestly, the craziest thing about this is the fact that we can get all of the same specs in the 14 inch. - [Nathan] You put 64 Gigs of RAM in the 14. - [Justine] Yes And an 8 TeraByte solid state drive. I edited this entire YouTube video, all of this, in bed with a blanket I heard not a single fan, - [Nathan] That's cool, what! - [Justine] barely got warm. - [Nathan] So this is 422 10 bit. - So you've been shooting a ton of 8K footage recently. - I have been shooting a ton of 8K footage on the Canon, there's a crumb on here. - That's from a muffin I had earlier. We don't have to look at that. Okay, I'm going to open up this 8k library, pop in some of your footage in Final Cuts. And I did have to install a Canon plugin because you shot this on the R5 all raw. - Yes, this is Canon R5, this is not the raw light. This is the full blown raw. I am really excited to see what this computer can do with this footage, because this footage is a beast. I cannot work with this footage in its native state, right out of the camera, 8K RAW, here we go. - [Justine] This looks good. - This looks amazing. I want to see what you did, so how did you click, where's the optimize button? What did you do? - So, it's over here. So, if you go into view, so you can do better performance, - Theoretically you can just start cutting right out of the camera, and. - [Justine] Should we do a little color? Like we want to add some, - [Nathan] Lets take a look. - [Justine] So if this was mine, I would be like, let's up this saturation all the way. - Do it. There's a lot in there. Let's just do it. - This is so fun having like the second display. But the crazy thing about this is like, I can do all of this on here. - It's the resolution on here is nice. - [Justine] I know, look at that, how does that look for you? - [Nathan] I think that looks great. - [Justine] Should we send it off to the client? (Nathan Laughing) How about this nice little tint. - [Nathan] Oh, yeah. - [Justine] I mean, these are adding these onto this 8K footage. like real time. - [Nathan] And it's still playing back. - It's still playing back. What if we add, let's just get a little crazy and add. It's still cruising, cruising. - [Nathan] It's still cruising - [Justine] This isn't even like ProRes, this is still the raw. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (Justine laughs) - She is just stacking the videos. - This is wild. So I want to see like kind of what you would be doing in Resolve. I again, have not really used Resolve very much. - My heart just stopped. - Do we have, I think we might have a defibrillator just in case. - This is insane. - Is this not something that happens? - We're playing back 8K RAW over 8, we're at 8192x4320 at 24 frames. We don't have optimization turned on. We don't have proxies rendered. - The hard thing is like, we're showing you this and it's running so seamless that having any type of comparison, like you don't understand, like this is things that you could not do before. - Could not do. Can I just apologize? - Why? - Everyone's going to comment that I wrote Justin stuff. When we started this project, - That's okay. - I'm so embarrassed. - That's fine. - I have remedied the situation. It's now Justine's stuff. - And we also got the studio version now of Resolve. We've got your key in and now, what are you going to show us? - Okay. We're going to look at noise reduction. The footage doesn't need it, but noise reduction is one of those things where if you have the coolest computer in the world and you add a full-blown layer of DaVinci Resolve temporal noise reduction, it's going to slow it down. (Justine agreeing) - Temporal noise reduction, keying off of every 5 frames, motion estimation type, better. - Well, yeah, you gotta. - You gotta. If this plays, - Are you going to freak out? - I don't know what I am going to do. - Well, you're obviously going to go buy one. - I can't even, here you hit the space bar. (Pleasant Music Playing) - He's gone. He's gone. He, Nathan has left us. He's gone to the Apple store. Do you want to cry? Should I get you a tissue? Are you going to be okay? - No. - Are you sure. - I'll be opening up another line of credits. (Justine laughs) - This is really amazing. I mean, the fact that this is really going to be game changing. I feel like for so many people, especially if you're just on sets and you want to just put it as 8K footage right there. And even for you. You're out in the field too. And the battery life, the battery life on the M1 was so absolutely impressive on the 13 inch. And this one has been significantly improved. This is the baseline 14 inch. You can also do two pro display XDRs, but on the 16 inch, you can do three pro display XDRs plus an output of a 4k TV. So just in case you needed a little bit extra. So this is the same 8K footage that we're working with... - [Nathan] Yeah. - on the 16 inch, completely spec-ed out. This is the baseline 14 inch on the M1 Pro Chip. - Of the new computers, the new laptops, this is the cheapest I can get. - Yes, Let's see what we can do. All right. We're going to just drop that in, oh. - [Nathan] Come on. - [Justine] Oh, it's playing. - [Nathan] How is it doing this? - [Justine] Oh my goodness. - I quit. - Well no, don't quit. - I buy - Just you buy. But like how much time you're going to be saving. Like, honestly, I think that's the thing that a lot of people who aren't doing the type of high end work that, you know, a lot of people in production are doing, or even like me and Tyler are doing on YouTube. Like this is going to save us days, - Days. - Days of time waiting for things to render, waiting for things to export. It's actually incredibly impressive. It's just live out on a filter. - [Nathan] Yeah. - [Justine] Oh okay. That's fine. - [Nathan] It looks pretty - [Justine] Yeah, it's pretty, it looks nice. Okay, let's just add on another one. Okay, cool. - This is the, not the extreme chip. This is the... - M1 pro. - The pro the pro chip with only 16 gigabytes of RAM. - 512 Gigs of solid state drive, like this is... - The smallest, the smallest, the smallest, the cheapest. the cheapest, the cheapest. - And you see what we're doing - And it's still able to do this and it's hand it's pushing it out to this big screen over here. This is nutty. - [Justine] Let's flip it - [Nathan] Completely. Oh my God. - [Justine] look at this. This is absurd. The fan is finally turning on. Finally. (Nathan Laughs) - It took how many layers we have to count. How many layers did you add? - 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. 15 effects, before the fan even turned on, like my old 16 inch MacBook. Like if you can just turn it on. - It's like, okay. - 10 Times, 10 times louder than this. Okay. Resolve. Oh, I had Resolve open that whole time. - What. - It was open while we were doing that test. - And you have iTunes, Music open... and Notes - Oh, I didn't even notice. Oh geez. Okay. So we, correction while we were doing that ... - And also how many tabs in Safari? - Oh, a couple. - [Nathan] Multiple Safari tabs. - Yeah. We had Resolve open while we were doing the task. Can you believe that? Oops. Resolve's open. Show me what you got. - Well, I, yeah, I feel like we know what we're gonna get. This is gonna be amazing. 8K footage and in a 1080 timeline. And here comes some temporal noise reduction and we're going to max it out. - Here. Comes the boy. - Okay, here we go. So what it did 80 frames, I believe last time, 80, 90 frames. - It's still playing though. Do you, what does it do for you on your work? - Well, first of all, I can't even play the .CRM file. So that plays in real time. And then we add noise reduction. - It's okay, It's still playing. Like. - It's still playing, That's still doable. - Yeah. - It's still, yeah. I hear the fan. - Do you? I think that might, I think that's a light over there that I don't think that's the fan. Okay. But if you don't know, if you hear it. - That's fair. - I swear. I think it's that light. The real contrasty, saturation. - [Nathan] Already. I mean like that's where we started. - [Justine] Yeah. That's a big difference. - [Nathan] And then this color. - [Justine] Look at that. - [Nathan] We haven't added any saturation. - No, I'd probably make it like a little warmer maybe, just because I feel like there's a lot of, I'd like some, some warmth in those rocks. Oh, this is so fun telling somebody else what to do. - Yeah. We'll mask the mask and then it's an unusual shape. So we'll draw it. - [Justine] There we go. - [Nathan] So that's a little cr... - [Justine] No, that's great. I like it. Wow. Okay. That's crazy. Now. It's like lava rocks. - It'll be cool to see how fast it'll track. - Okay. - So we'll go here. (voices overlap) - Tracking. We have got tracker. - Nice. - Boom. It just automatically analyzed all of these motion tracking points and then I'm going to play backwards and it's going to track reverse. It looks a little weird once it gets covered with water. - [Justine] I don't think so, I don't think so because... - [Nathan] You like it? There's something underneath. - [Justine] Oh yeah because, There is something underneath. Just as a reminder, the lowest end new MacBook. - [Nathan] I can just sit here and play all day long. - Me too, but unfortunately we have to go edit this video and post it tomorrow, so. - Well then - Wow. - I think I'm going to go get one. - Yeah, you should, you really should, you should. Okay Nathan, how are you feeling after our edit session? - My mind is blown, most blown with the 14 inch Mac. - I was surprised too, because I hadn't done any extensive testing. Cause I edited my entire Sony project on the 16 inch and was so blown away by that I'm even more impressed by the baseline 14 inch. And it's like, we're doing high-end processor, intensive things. So just everyday tasks for people doing simple photo editing, email, everything loads so fast and snappy. - Instantaneously - I have, Okay. So I'm sure you've probably done this, but I've accidentally selected all and then opened up a bunch of images and files. (Nathan laughs) - In the Photoshop? - Yes by accident. So I opened up a, like probably 45. It was a ridiculous amount of 4k clips by accidents - That's when you just command quit the whole, you shut down the whole computer, start over again. - By the time it would've taken me to force quit the entire finder, they were already open and playing. And I was like, what? - On the new one? - Yes (Nathan Laughing) - It was like, so mind blowing. So it's like simple things like, that I think people aren't realizing is going to impact them on just sort of like a, like a baseline level. Like you can load things so quick. - We're going to be super spoiled, super spoiled. - Yeah. I mean, I was super spoiled when I got the Mac Pro and now I'm like, okay this MacBook is actually going to be replacing an entire computer, which. - That is so crazy. Do you hear what you're saying? - Yeah, I mean the Mac Pro that I have now is a completely spec-ed out model. I don't even know what the price of it is in total. - It's tens of thousands of dollars. - By the time we have the monitors, the updated RAM, the afterburner, everything completely spec-ed out. And now to go to this, a $6000 MacBook. - Why would they? - Or even a $2,000 MacBook to completely replace it. - It's like they out-invented themselves. - It's really impressive. And I know that I'm the kind of person that like, I need to be more present. I need to live in the now. But when that 13 inch MacBook came out, I knew that whatever was coming out next was going to be ridiculous. And this is still setting up because we don't even have, an iMac pro yet. We're going to definitely see another Mac Pro. - Oh my goddess with all the new chip. - Yes, so just think about where we are now and like what the future is going to hold. I'm going to live in the now I'm going to enjoy my 16-inch MacBook Pro. - This is amazing - Or maybe I'm going to actually switch to the 14-inch. I'm not sure which one I really even want now. - The 14 inch makes sense for you and how you travel. I like the 16 inch for the real estate, just showing client. Cause a lot of times you're editing, you're right there, front center, I'm doing something for a client they're over my shoulder. And those two inches of real estate, that helps a little bit. - It makes actually a really big difference. I mean, I really enjoyed telling you to make those rocks a different color. Like this is really cool telling somebody else what to do. Wow. - Why don't we do that more often? - I don't know we can. - We should. - Yeah. - I think we should do that. - Usually there's not enough time. Like I have to stay up all night and edit and I can't make somebody else do that. So it's like just, you're just going to suffer. So that's what we do. - Oh my goodness. - Well, Nathan, thank you so much for joining me. - Thank you for having me. - I'm so glad that you really got to experience this because I really wanted to have somebody else's perspective to make sure that like, I wasn't just super impressed and being a fan girl. - Right? - That this was justified. - Yeah, no, like legitimate, this will save me days. And it's just like, you think about how time, I mean time is money. (mumbles) but the ability to shoot 8K raw and finish it with the client the same day that I shot it, not have to render proxies. Like that's going to change my whole workflow. - That's going to pay for this MacBook for you. - Okay, I'll go buy it right now. - Sold. Well Nathan, thank you so much. I'll put all of his links in the description where you can go check out some of his work. Super talented. So awesome. Thank you so much for joining me. I look forward to seeing your review of the MacBook after you go shopping today. - Oh my gosh - After you leave here. - No pressure or anything. - We'll see you guys later. Again, if you haven't already, please subscribe. Make sure you hit the bell and leave us some comments below about, I don't even know, like are you impressed? Cause I'm impressed. Nathan's impressed. - Yeah, I'm so impressed. Can't wait to see what everyone does with this thing. - It's going to be amazing. We'll see you guys later. Bye. (outro music)",

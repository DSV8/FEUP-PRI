    "description": "This is Part 2 of my CML-Personal (VIRL 2) series showing you how to download, install and configure Cisco Modeling Labs - Personal (VIRL 2) using VMware Player and Windows 10. The new version of Cisco VIRL allows you to create virtual Cisco networks using just your Web browser. You don't have to use a thick client or any other software - everything is included and everything is easy to use.  The new version of Cisco VIRL 2 is one of your best options for CCNA,  CCNP and CCIE Labs. VIRL 2 has multiple advantages over other platforms such as GNS3 or EVE-NG. VIRL 2 supports an HTML5 web client and contains all the Cisco IOS images. You don't have to use a thick client like you do with GNS3. You don't have to follow a convoluted process to get Cisco images working like you do with EVE-NG.   You don't have to try to find images as they are all included as part of your VIRL subscription and by simply mapping an ISO drive to your virtual machine you can immediately start using all Cisco IOS images in your topologies. Both EVE-NG and GNS3 require that you provide your own IOS images - typically they recommend that you buy a VIRL subscription anyway. That means that you are already paying for VIRL.   VIRL2 is also an official Cisco product - that means that you don't have to worry about any gray legal issues with regards to running Cisco IOS images on your laptop. This is an official Cisco product that is supported by Cisco. By paying your yearly subscription fee of $199, you can use Cisco IOS images such as IOSv, IOSvL2, ASAv, NX-OSv and others without any worries. VIRL 2 has everything you need to get started.  Disadvantages include the requirement to license your installation. That however has been simplified dramatically from previous releases. There is also a 20 node limited in topologies. However, for most of us that is fine for a lot of labs.  Is VIRL better than GNS3 or EVE-NG? In many ways it is. But, all platforms have advantages and disadvantages. If you are studying for your ccie, you many prefer gns3 or eve-ng as they don't limit the number of devices in a topology like virl does. VIRL-PE limits you to 20 devices - so your topologies cannot be massive like they could with gns3 or eve ng. However, if you are studying for your ccna or ccnp, VIRL may be more than enough.  Cisco have made massive changes to their certification programs and it is fantastic to see the new version of VIRL in action.

    "transcript": "- This is the second video in my series showing you how to download, install and configure Cisco VIRL. If you haven't watched the first video, then please go and watch that. I've linked it here and below so that you can see the initial part of the download, installation and configuration of Cisco VIRL. In this video, I'm continuing the series and I'm going to show you how to license the VIRL server and then I'm going to show you how to configure the Cisco routers and switchers that we added to a VIRL topology. So two big things in this video. I'm going to show you how to license the VIRL server and I'm going to show you how to configure the Cisco routers and switchers and verify connectivity between the devices in our VIRL topology. Okay, so let's get started. (techno music) Now probably the hardest part of the initial setup is the licensing. Now if I try and start up this topology, by clicking on simulate, start lab, notice I get an error message, system not licensed. You have to license your system before you can start using it. This product uses Smart Licensing. I'm going to click register to register a license. Now in this example, I've been given a token from the developers. I'll add a link below this video to a licensing video for Cisco VIRL once the product is live to show you the process if it's different. But basically, you need to get a token from the VIRL website. So all you need to do is paste the token in that you've been given and then click register to register your product with Cisco Smart Licensing. Once it's registered, it'll say registration status registered, license authorization status authorized. You'll see your Smart Account details. The Virtual Account I'm using here is from one of the VIRL developers. So now that my license has been authorized, I can go to lab setup and select my lab, and click simulate and click start lab. My computer's CPU is starting to go crazy now. I should be using Cisco VIRL on a computer with more RAM but I wanted to simply show you the full process of getting VIRL up and running. Okay, so it took my computer a while to boot up these devices because I'm not using the recommended minimum amount of RAM. But that's okay for this demonstration. Notice I've got a little green tick on my devices and now when I hover over the device, I could either stop it, or I could open up a console. And this changes to a black screen, I can click open console, I'll move this up because my resolution is quite low on this laptop. Okay so one issue I've been having is I'm using the Brave browser here and it's causing all kinds of issues when I try and open up a console to the device. I had to lower my shields in Brave so that I can access the terminal. So you probably don't want to use Brave. So I'm actually going to close this down. So what I'm going to do rather than use Brave is start Google Chrome. I'm gonna navigate to that VIRL server and login with my username of Admin, password of Cisco123. And I'm gonna open up my topology and as you can see, the devices have booted. I can see green ticks next to the devices. I can move the topology around by simply clicking in this white space and dragging the devices around. I could add a node but I'm gonna collapse that. I'm going to move this up because my resolution on this laptop isn't great. Now notice in my lab info, I can see four nodes, three links, 20 interfaces. Simulate allows me to start, stop or wipe a lab. I can see my nodes and I can see that they've booted. I can see the uptime and CPU utilization. But let's click on one of the devices and notice I have this option to open up a console. So I'm going to click on the device and open up a console. So click open console and I need to press enter to activate this terminal. As you can see right there, I'm asked, do I want to enter the initial configuration dialogue, I'm gonna say no. I'll click on iosv-1, open up a terminal, press enter and once again, bypass the initial configuration dialogue. So back on my first device, you can see it's busy booting up. Now notice this is clipped here, it's not looking very good so I'm going to auto select the columns and the rows. So 80 and 24 rows. These error messages are typical when you don't have enough RAM or CPU in your computer. This is a problem not with VIRL, but with the physical hardware that I've got. I'm getting a lot of errors here about tasks taking a long time and it's running quite slow. So I'm going to type enable, type conf t, give the router a name, router 1, interface Gigabit O/O. That's the interface that I use, under connectivity I can see that, Gigabit O/O is connected to Gigabit O/O on the switch. I'm gonna no shut that interface and give it an IP address of let's say 10.1.1.1, just keep it very simple. Press tab, and notice /24mask so that's my IP address. Show IP interface brief, there are my interfaces, that interface is up. Now please notice, I'm doing everything through my browser here. I'm not running any local software apart from Chrome. Everything is running currently in my browser. I'm going to click iosv-1, and I'm gonna open up a console to that device. Notice, name is router, so let's give this a host name of router 2, interface Gigabit O/O connectivity once again shows me that this router's connected by Gigabit O/O to the switch on Gigabit O/1. So I'll go back to the console, no shut interface, IP address, let's say 10.1.1.2, /24 mask, type end, and I should hopefully be able to ping router one through those two switches now, and I can. So notice, router 2 can ping router 1. I'll save the config of router 2, go back to router 1, iosv-O, ping 10.1.1.2, wrong IP address there, so that should be 2, 10.1.1.2, that works. Now the node info currently is iosv-0, let's make that router 1, let's click on this guy, make him router 2. So I'm simply editing everything through the gooey here. I'm not doing anything through a local thick client. Everything is being done through the browser. So by simply clicking on a device and going to console, I can access the console of that device. So again, router 1 can ping router 2. Let's create a loopback on this router. So interface loopback 0, IP address quadruple 1. 255.255.255.255, /32 mask and actually let's run ospf here so router ospf 1, network and I'll enable ospf 1, all interfaces in area O and I'll save that config, go to router 2. I'm looking at the console, so interface loopback O, IP address quadruple 2, router ospf-1, network, and I'll enable ospf on all interfaces. And I'll save the config. Back on router 1, show IP route. We haven't learnt any ospf routes yet to show idos neighbor, we add 2WAY/DROTHER at the moment, status changed to exstart. Router 2 is the designated router on this segment. Now again, this laptop doesn't have enough RAM in it. I'm running below the minimum recommended RAM for VIRL so it's running a bit slower than I would have expected. Ospf agency has now been formed. We've gone from loading to full. So show IP ospf neighbor, node is FULL/DR, show IP route, we've got a ospf route that's been learnt. So I should be able to ping the loopback of router 2 which I can. I'll click on router 2 and I'll ping the loopback of router 1 and that works. Okay so that was a basic demonstration of Cisco VIRL, I've shown you how to download VMware workstation player, I've shown you how to download Cisco VIRL, the interface may be slightly different when VIRL goes live. I've shown you how to import VIRL into VMware workstation player, I've shown you how to license the VIRL server, the token process may be slightly different once again, use the link below this video to see another video where I show you the updated licensing information if it's changed. But it's very simple to bold a topology in Cisco VIRL. Interface is very nice, I can go back to Lab Manager, under tools, notice there are a whole bunch of options here. I can see my licensing information, I can see system administration information. Like I can download labs as an example. There's a whole bunch of options in Cisco VIRL, I'll talk more about the Cisco VIRL options in subsequent videos but I simply wanted to show you how to get Cisco VIRL up and running initially. I think Ralph and Simon and the Cisco VIRL team have done a fantastic job here, fantastic product, looks good, has all the images bold into it, the licensing process is a lot easier than it was in the past, fantastic product. I'd highly recommend that you use Cisco VIRL, this is gonna give serious competition to GNS3 and eve-ng and I'll probably be using Cisco VIRL more and more now because it's a Cisco official product.. Cisco VIRL supports a whole bunch of devices, we've got WAN emulators, we've got devices such as ubuntu servers here so I could access an ubuntu server directly within Cisco VIRL. There are unmanaged switches, various other devices, you can add your own devices to Cisco VIRL as well. But notice Cisco devices such as asas are also bold into Cisco VIRL and are available within Cisco VIRL. So you can bold fantastic Cisco topologies directly within VIRL. Great product, highly recommend Cisco VIRL. I personally will be using Cisco VIRL more and more, highly recommend this product. (techno music)",

    "transcript": "the glorious model O- versus the Coolermaster mm710 the two mice I've used daily for the past two weeks and I want to break down everything you need to know about these two models and which small and light Mouse might suit you best good people the gamer storm castle 240 X gives you a peace of mind with anti leak tech inside by reducing pressure build-up as temperatures fluctuate Plus this one the best looking Punk designs with a removable mirror cover and swappable logo pieces with full addressable RGB support for that extra bling check it out below alright so let's begin with the price both my start at $49 with a $10 premium for the glossy O- with the two years warranty for each now I love the dual color and service options for the glorious my favorite being the matte white as I don't really like how the glossy surface feels to the touch while the mm710 is supposed to come on all the same colors and service options but they're not yet available outside of the matte black a quick mention on the design the model O minus is a beautiful Mouse with awesome RGB elements on the sides and the scroll wheel with a honeycomb pattern while the 710 is basically bare-bones no illumination and the coolermaster logo for the perforations the packaging with glorious is also incredible impressive what they can do for the price point to really stand out while cooler masters presentation doesn't even deserve a mention the mm710 is available on Amazon with cheap shipping while the o- goes directly through glorious and the leave links below I will say the glorious Mouse probably has better resale value because the original model all right now on Amazon is about $30 over the original retail price and you'll never see that with coolermaster the build quality of the glourious also feels better with smaller spaces on the frame no rattling on the internals however the internal components on the 710 are coated to protect against dust and moisture as I mentioned in my original review of the mm710 they have strengthened the body like the sides don't flex as much as the original the buttons don't have too much sway left and right but the rattle is still present yeah now wait and size it probably why these two mice are getting so much attention the MM 710 on my scale is just under 55 grams while the O minus is two grams heavier and honestly in real world use this to Graham difference is indistinguishable but when I put in my model O on the scale that thing feels like an elephant now quite heavy quite bulky still awesome in my hand but in comparison to both the mm710 in the oh - yeah the 15 gram difference is pretty noticeable but it will definitely be the shape that will nudge you towards one or the other so the O- is skinnier it's longer and it's shorter so it's truly for small hands while the 710 is wider and taller that from my hand size and hybrid grip is actually very comfortable because the back curve is not so smooth as only O minus so with the glorious Mouse I lose that bit of palm support at the back while the Cooler master accommodates me well they are both ambidextrous shapes with thumb buttons only on the left side and even though the o- did not immediately feel as comfortable as the 710 after two days of just using the O- I was pretty comfortable with the mouse I didn't have to readjust my grip as my pinky would fall off the right side and I was dragging it on the mouse mat whereas the taller body on the 710 was enough to support my ring and pinky fingers this of course will not be an issue for people with smaller hands which is why the o- exists but it's just interesting how the 710 is slightly shorter and length but it because of the back curve it accommodates my larger hands very well whereas the o- not so much I also would like to give an audible mention to the extra Phi M for RGB so these just got in their brand-new mice and size-wise they are pretty small they're slightly bigger than the MM710 but they're also heavier at 70 grams so if you don't like a super lightweight Mouse this is a really good option and I'll have a review on that soon so stay tuned the cord on both is very good shoelace type pair cord on the model o- with a more condensed ultra weave on the 710 that is slightly shorter with a purple USB port and I do prefer the cord on the 710 as a doesn't kink as easily as the O- plus it's less the feet on both are white PTFE better quality and glide on the model on - just feel smoother compared to the 710 that by the way comes with additional replacement set of feet which is nice alright so let's talk buttons and both have basically identical layout I do love the DPI color indicator at the bottom of the O- so you know which dpi you're using you can even customize that and the software with up to 6 dpi levels while the lack of any lighting on the 710 means you just gotta feel what dpi you're using on the screen and what makes things worse is that we have 7 dpi levels in a software that you can not turn off so if you like me and only use two settings you can go one by one until you set the seventh dpi setting and then I set that to like 16,000 dpi which is the maximum and that lets me know that I'm resetting the cycle but it'll just be nice to turn off the rest of the dpi levels and just keep - I do prefer the scroll wheel on the 710 with much better control as the oh - feels mushy while primary clicks on the glorious are super crispy and have shorter travel they both have Armour and switches rated at 20 million clicks now performance wise the 710 has a higher end sensor that Pixar 3389 with 16,000 dpi while the o- is rocking the 3360 with 12,000 dpi it is really hard to distinguish between either as they're both fantastic and a great extension of your hands for accurate aim lift off distance from both is very low around one millimeter and both are incredibly fun to use if the body shape fits your hand size and grip style fingertip for the o- and hybrid palm for the 710 and the last few interesting bits is both have internal memory built-in so once you configure them the software you move the mouse to another computer you don't need the software which by the way functionally is basically identical like remapping your buttons or recording macros we have D bounce time adjustment on both mice that's awesome with two lift off distance settings and you can further add surface tuning with a 710 that might optimize the liftoff distance for that particular Mouse mat but that's about it so I want to conclude by saying that $50.00 both bites are fantastic and kind of catered to a different hand size and grip style so the mm710 for me personally is better and at $50 it's all about performance without bling while the o- is an awesome release to accommodate smaller hands with finger grip without compromising on quality or the visual side of things I'm really happy that we have such fresh competition into my segment and that was not expecting coolermaster to deliver on their promises with the MM710 but the scrollwheel is better and the cord I also liked on the Cooler master mouse while the glourious is all about RGB small size and really just awesome quality the new Hydra x-series from Corsair is a full water-cooling ecosystem with transparent blocks for RGB goodness and built-in flow indicators with soft and hard - being available and the full array of fittings so you can design the perfect loop for you hide your X by Corsair everything's linked below I'll make sure to link everything in description below thanks so much for watching check out this other relevant content subscribe for more I'll talk to you guys next week you",

    "transcript": "you know what time it is Cologne time Oh oh man I love these quick spin transitions now for the show floor almost there but no GPU yet we'll see so that is the new RTX from Nvidia pretty exciting stuff but let me explain everything to you the new master keys MK 750 keyboard comes with a comfortable magnetic rest rest beautiful RGB light bar on the perimeter and perky lighting control with a variety of Cherry MX switches and the bottom type-c connection Cooler master doing it right check it out below so here's a funny thing my nametag is spelled wrong usually my last name is misspelled my first time it's my first name that's misspelled and how do you say pal demurred e dirty I'm hurt temerity for today the murder murder everyone everyone put the murti in the comments just nothing but demurred ease Oh my good people Wow so the new rtx series has finally launched we have pretty much you know the basic information out of it and I can guarantee the new RTX 20 series are definitely the cards for the future and so we have the our RTX 2070 the 2080 and the 2080 TI they're supposed to be on the shelf on September 20th but only for the 2080 and a 2080 TI because the our RTX 2070 while everyone is excited about the GPU is not yet available pre-orders are not up and no board partners are selling that car just yet as well so we'll have to wait and see when that comes out potentially sometime in October now the pricing for the new 20 series cards is kind of variable so the founders Edition are more expensive versus like slightly lower clock reference editions from work partners are going for about $50 cheaper which is the example with the RTXs 2080 so the founders Edition is $7.99 versus EVGA Sangam for 750 or the pre-orders are going out but they also have the 850 versions so it all depends on the clocks the rtx 2080 TI for example goes for $1,200 for the founders Edition and again $50 cheaper for the custom board partner EVGA version but you also have a $50 extra premium on top of their higher clock starts while the RTX 2070 is starting from $4.99 which is a super attractive price point for you know the new 20 series GPUs but the founders Edition is $5.99 and you cannot preorder that just yet but still you can see there is that price fluctuation between founders Edition and reference cards now for the basic specifications the rtx 2070 is running in two thousand three hundred four quarter course at 16 20 megahertz on the boost with a gigabytes of gddr5 the RTX 2080 has 2944 CUDA cores with 17 10 megahertz on the boost and eight gigabytes of gddr5 epi is kind of insane at 4352 cuda cores 1545 on the megahertz on the boost and 11 gigabytes of gddr5 how they in games versus the previous Pascal architecture but the new Turin architecture seems promising because of the new rtx platform and this is pretty exciting because now we have new hardware on the actual die that handle specific tasks with regards to AI and rate tracing so we have new tensor cores and new RT cores that will handle those particular tasks very well and while we still have the regular graphics pipeline through cooler course and it handling compute very well and these new tensor cores and RT cores seem to be so important to move the whole visual industry forward within gaming because that way we can have you know photorealistic life realistic light reflections right refractions within your scene so it is based on texture based on other objects with a new environment and that is pretty amazing to see and some of the demos that they've showed like bow fit 5 and actually seen fire you know reflecting off a hood of a metal car and then seeing that in Windows and seeing how all those scenes interact with each other to give you like a really beautiful and visually stimulated gameplay it was truly starting to see something like that especially when we have RTX on and off that visual representation on what exactly our RTX gives us in terms of that visual advantage you know it's not there to give us any indication for better competitive advantage in the game but it's all about that visual experience so it is I would say highly subjective and that brings up an important concern because these tensor cores and RT cores occupy physical space on the die so what happens if they're not being used by the application and so Nvidia is trying to give developers that hardware to handle AI and ray-tracing tasks and so it is almost like reliant on developers buy-in for RTX to be successful and one relevant example I can give you is with quick sing support with Adobe Premiere and how it's been so slow to get adopted by such a popular program within you know with a PC space and so it also brings up the concerns of RTX and in the future another example is aimed the true audio which was an actual also function block that's built-in onto the die but game developers didn't use it and therefore it was wasted and almost dead on arrival and so this entire MTX ecosystem with the twenty series cards it's kind of the future of graphics cards because of that visual advancement that we get with light interaction within your scene but it is highly dependent on developers by in with MTX and them using that platform to your built-in into their games and right now I think we have about 21 games that they've said that Nvidia said we'll come with MTX support which is great to see but we need to see that on a much larger scale because right now it's such a new technology that's looking so far in a head that the consumer ends up paying for the cost of that adoption now one tiny concern the rises from seeing the demos like the Ironman suit where he's all dressed up in this like really shiny metal is that everything becomes a little bit too shiny and I understand from a point of a demo that it's awesome to see how that texture is interacting with the light that is in the scene I just hope that game developers don't push that too far and make everything super shiny so that everything can be reflecting light because not only will that be just a huge hindrance of performance on the GPU most likely but also it might look too fake when it's like too shiny and too reflective so we'll see and so this entire 20 series launch is pretty exciting because RTX is the future of gaming visuals I think you know ray-tracing incorporating like that proper light interaction between textures materials and other light sources within your scene that is awesome but NVIDIA relies heavily on the future games to push RTX and not what is available now and that's understandable and so my question to you is do you think that there's no price premium especially for the RTX 2080 ti for $500 more versus the GTX 1080 TI is worth it to you right now because there is nothing on the market that has rtx support just yeah so you kind of have to buy into the architecture and this whole ecosystem with the expectation of rtx enabled applications to come later a few more things I'd like to mention is the whole GTD are six memory so it's faster much higher bandwidth for that plus we have the new and you link support so I think if you're doing SLI then you're combining the entire memory pool you're not just having it and we also have the virtual link so the type-c connection at the back of the card for future of your applications and I'm guessing because we have the new tensor cores and our RT cores for VR applications that's going to be just killer killer quality and super performance and yeah overall I think they're preparing to go into direction where the industry is just about to turn and it seems like Nvidia is their first I also would love to hear what you think about the new shroud design for the founders addition you know duel fans kinda like that flat section in the center illuminate logo of course and that backplate but now because we have two fans the back side of the card is closed so the air will be exhausted through the top of the card where the geforce text is located with the rtx so it looks okay but yeah let us know if you thinking alright guys so that is the RTX 20 series from Nvidia pretty exciting stuff and they will just have to wait and see how those new tensor and RT cores are utilized and how they are wasted outside of this whole RTX arena in regular games that don't utilize that stuff but you have to wait and see so make sure to subscribe check out this other realm content and we'll see you in the next video",

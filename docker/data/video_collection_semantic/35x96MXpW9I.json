Follow Snazzy Labs on Twitter -  Follow me on Instagram -   MacRumors, 9to5Mac, and other reported that as of iOS 12.4 there are new restore and setup options for your new iPhone. The restore over iCloud and restore over iTunes methods remain however there is now the ability to transfer your data ad hoc over wifi or wired via the Lightning Camera Connection Kit. We test these methods and help determine which is the fastest way to setup your new iPhone and which is the most reliable.",

    "transcript": "Earlier this week Apple released iOS version 12.4 and in it they have significantly changed the way that setting up a new iPhone is performed So prior to iOS 12.4 there were really two ways you could set up a new iPhone through iTunes No one did or you could go through the setup process That would restore your data through iCloud, now in that iCloud restore process There were really two ways You could perform an iCloud restore One, was manually by setting up your Wi-Fi logging into your iCloud account and then selecting the backup that you wanted to restore or a new feature introduced about two years ago or so you could use your old iPhone to scan a code and that would automatically handoff your Wi-Fi credentials your iCloud account info and Restore your new iPhone with the most recent iCloud backup via the internet It was pretty slick But in iOS 12.4 that all changes and it's kind of weird because there doesn't seem to be much visual Indication that there's a big difference but there really is there are now four ways to transfer backup data to your new phone Method one which is an iTunes restore method two, which is an iCloud restore and by the way Both of these methods are the same as they have always been So method one on iTunes restore everything except for your app binaries are transferred locally all your photos videos contacts messages app data settings and more are Transferred from the backup file locally stored on your computer so long as that data isn't already present in iCloud According to Apple more on that in a second and method two the iCloud backup Obviously downloads everything via iCloud the internet, but there are two new ways to restore a new iPhone method three transfer from iPhone over Wi-Fi and method four, transfer from iPhone over a wired connection now methods three and four both act Similarly to iTunes in that they transfer everything not present in iCloud except for your app Binaries with method three rather than establishing a Wi-Fi connection to your router and downloading everything via the internet like an iCloud restore Transfer from iPhone makes an ad-hoc Wi-Fi connection to your old iPhone And then transfers data directly from the source Method four is nearly identical in functionality, but rather than using local ad-hoc Wi-Fi It utilizes the Lightning camera connection kit You can plug the adapter into the destination phone and then you plug the lightning cable into the source phone Isn't that so elegant? I mean way better than USB C to USB C Isn't it? Thank you Apple So those are the four methods, but which should you do? Why and which is the fastest we've done a lot of? fricking restores over the last two days and we have determined in our testing the following first off every single backup method redownloads your apps from the App Store as of last year app binaries have been thinned and Fingerprinted to each individual device to A prevent piracy and then B to reduce how much local storage apps take up on your phone But what that also means is that you've got to redownload all of them regardless of the backup method In terms of raw speed, iCloud restores remain the fastest this, of course, is because unlike other methods it only transfers core data initially and the remaining content either just hangs out in iCloud until the user requests it or It continues to download non crucial data in the background Several hours after the restore is allegedly completed the iTunes and transfer from iPhone over Wi-Fi. Methods are similar in speed and it's our opinion that these methods are worth the extra wait over an iCloud restore as despite Apple's documentation They actually appear to transfer everything present on the device being transferred from including full resolution photos complete message history More complete app data, etc. That is not transferred by an iCloud backup despite Apple's indications contrary to the matter Strangely enough the transfer from iPhone over wired method was all over the place the first time we tested it It was quite a bit faster than the transfer from iPhone over Wi-Fi It makes sense the second time though, it just straight-up failed and the third time it took nearly double that of the Wi-Fi transfer Weird to think that Wi-Fi is more reliable than a wired transfer but it's 2019. I mean we live in the future future without USB-C. In conclusion iPhone continues to flex on Android when it comes to easy backups and new device migration What was already good gets even better and we strongly recommend the transfer from iPhone over Wi-Fi method come iPhone 11 that is if the iPhone is even worth upgrading to I just burned iPhone and Android in the same sentence. I'm so good at this. Thank you, sir I don't deserve your thumbs up, but if you want to give them great if not, whatever Thank you so much for watching and as always stay snazzy!

    "transcript": "now I know I've looked at a lot of mini pieces lately but this one is easily the cream of the crop cuz apparently they managed to stuff not just a bunch of high-end gaming Hardware in here but they also liquid cooled the Mini PC with a real exciting hidden feature which is either going to give us some cool gaming action or it's a complete recipe for disaster I guess we have so I guess we're going to have to find that out today let's open it up but first if you want to open up a box full of new skills today's video sponsor brilliant is for you brilliant is where you learn through practical application with thousands of interactive lessons in math data analysis programming and Ai and because brilliant's lessons focus on problem solving not only will you learn new skills you'll also become a better thinker brilliant recently added their thinking in code course which helps you problem solve like a programmer so try out brilliant at brilliant.org David and you'll also get 20% off an annual subscription [Music] whoa the render on the box looks even cooler than I remember the render in the email looking look at that thing now aside from all of the liquid cooling which is just some Next Level Mini PC EP there's also a powerful PC being cooled by it it's it's got an I9 3900 H in it yes H I got that right which is like a high-end Intel laptop CPU it's also got an RTX 4060 in it but best of all it's called the Maman G1 which may be one of the best product names I've heard in a while oh wait no never mind that's the mega mini G1 or the me I guess no way is that right cuz you're like ruining the nice box oh no oh I mean there's quite a lot of damage on the top of it but but I think you can slice that and then pull it off I hope wow it is not quite as many as I was expecting but it makes sense they had to make room for what looks like potentially a custom Loop so aside from an HDMI cable which they always include with mini piecs it's a nice touch we get our pretty big power brick although for like a a lot of gaming performance it could have been a lot bigger and it's a 330 W power brick wow that's quite small for a 330 W power Breck actually give me a second to put it into perspective this is what a 330 W power brick used to look like and now it looks like that it's a lot smaller and a lot lighter so that's pretty cool but anyway let's put this aside I am most interested in this bit of it which they put it in a real slippery bag and then you slide it open like it looks exactly like it does in the renders so there's clearly a radiator in the back which looks like 120 mil radiator quite a thick 120 mil radiator if it's that entire thickness with a fan in front then there are these tubes protruding from brass fittings so you can easily show your friends its liquid cooling we'll get a close look at the inside I am going to open it of course I'm going to open it now in terms of I/O it's also very good so on the front we've got four 10 GB USB ports and a full-sized SD card slot which is even usable for me that's exciting I wonder if it's like UHS 2 or what speed that is oh and on the back is something really cool aside from a whole bunch more USB 2 HDMI which which is nice I like that they have a second port and 2.5 GB ethernet it's got an ocul link port on the back which means it's going to be really easy for you to plug an external graphics card into this system you're not going to have to gerver an internal n.2 slot into an oculink board there's just one on the back of the system this is metal I think I mean it's cold so it it should be metal and then on the top there is some more ventilation so I think this is where air is going to get sucked into the case and then it gets blown out through the back here but with that I'm super excited to turn this thing on we'll tear it down and plug a graphics card into it later [Music] [Music] oo and because this isn't a big brand system the windows install is about as clean as a fresh install can be and aside from our 13 900h and 32 gigs of ddr5 in dual ch the system has an RTX 4060 in it which lets you screen capture the desktop so I'm guessing it's a desktop variant also the system's bios has the kind of functionality you'd expect from an HP Chromebook but with that let's see how it gains wild CS2 performance at 1080p low settings uh of course that was going to happen we've got an RTX 4060 in here and a powerful enough chip to power it and the system is barely having to do anything to provide this very smooth Esports experience which means very low power draw on the components which leads to Great temperatures and it's not particularly noisy either but let's do something a bit more demanding and see what happens to those temperature figures with doom maternal at 1080p ultra settings again lots of frame rate happening but the system's having to work harder to do that we've got more utilization which means the temperatures are a bit higher but it's still very quiet and switching over to 1440p the system scales very well with higher resolutions we're still getting a lot of frame rate here and then when it comes to cyberpunk at 1440p high settings that is a lot of frame rate for a Mini PC to be churning out the game is running very smooth very well and again the noise is very under control but considering that we've got liquid cooling in here I think we should let the game Run for a while so that the whole loop saturates with heat so that we can see where the temperatures and noise top Out ooh it's taking a while but it's getting real spicy and you get the occasional CPU temperature jump to 100 C at least it's still whisper quiet so you can't crank the fan up interestingly if you put a heavy load just on the CPU the temperatures are very under control which makes sense cuz it's not also having to cool a graphics card pumping 120 watt into that liquid cooling Loop which I guess is very promising for the oculink performance considering we won't be using the 4060 but before we plug a waifu into this system let's check out the tear down cuz this PC's build is fascinating so now comes the terrifying process of tearing this thing down this is one of the scarier systems I've torn down because I feel like there's pretty huge margins for massive disaster here now straight off the bat I don't see any just obvious means of Ingress which kind of makes me assume that we've got screws hiding under the feet uh there's lots of glue ooh that's not a fun foot to take off but luckily it does have little like catcher things so I think it's replaceable and there is our screw oh wow that very much just lifts off W that's actually quite a neat way to access all of our storage there's an additional m.2 slot which is a little bit shorter than average but I'm sure she won't mind and then next to that under our two terab m.2 Drive hides the Wi-Fi card and then on the other side of that is our upgradeable dual Channel ddr5 okay now we need to figure out how to get deeper not sure how to continue I just started undoing every screw I could find oh that kind of wing just pops off and there's a whole bunch of ribbon cables under [Music] that and then on this side we've got more fan headers and stuff and these ribbon cables say that they're for the motherboard so that makes me think that this isn't the main board this is just where all the storage and stuff is attached to and then the graphics got in the CPU is on that PCB we see underneath which meant I had to get back to screwing and undoing ribbon cables and the further I got in the process the more clear it became that I was going to have a real tough time reassembling this thing is there oh sneaky little screws hiding under the ram slots there we go oh we've also got the Wi-Fi anten Anna oh there's just a CPU under there and after struggling to remove the Wi-Fi antenna we could have a closer look so the bottom of that PCB which we just removed in a process which 100% didn't involve pant soiling this is just a CPU look at that so this is the 13900 H and it's a pretty powerful laptop chip and you can tell that it's a laptop chip cuz it's a very weird shape under the thermal pad is a whole bunch of power delivery for set CPU so this is one of the two motherboards uh but there is another one that has our RTX 4060 on it so that lives under the pump block that's a fascinating design because it's kind of a dual sided block so that it cools the CPU on the top and the graphics card on the bottom wow some serious design went into this thing but we still need to check out the GPU so let's figure out how to get access to that and the deeper I got into the system the more intimidating the tear down became because there was so many screws and it wasn't clear which end you should go in through first but eventually I decided to just try and remove the block off the bottom PCB which went medium well no way despite getting the very exciting PCB unseated it was still mounted to the cooling block and changing that involved bending the block out and unscrewing the PCB from the bottom look at that it's a 4060 mxm board which for those of you that don't know this is a standard that they used to use for replaceable graphics cards in laptops but I didn't realize you got like a 4060 variant of it that's just so cool and it means that theoretically the graphics card is upgradeable in this system so this is the little PCB that our mxm board connects to and there's a whole bunch of ribbon cables that connect it with with data to the main motherboard but unfortunately that's about as deep as I could get into the system no matter how many screws I undid the only progress I made was getting access to the fill port on the bottom of the loop I even tried getting in through the top but quickly started damaging the system and eventually threw in the towel so now that we've seen the little systems voluptuous interior there's just one thing left to do we got to plug a waifu in its button and see what happens and just like that we've got a waifu RX 7800 XT plugged into the back of our little water cooled Mini PC that's a really cool Port I'm super excited about that uh but with that let's turn it on but I then immediately ran into two problems the graphics card wasn't reacting to the Mini PC being turned on and neither was the mini PC's liquid cooling so after struggling to turn it on for 20 minutes I left the system unpluged bugged for a while after which the liquid cooling turned on but the graphics card still didn't hey it randomly works again now but that was just an id1 issue because there was a tiny dip switch on the oculink PCB that was turned off for some reason and when I turned that on everything was working oh okay it's finally working very good so now we get to see how much more performance we get from our RX 7800 XT and just like that we've got some more gaming performance this this is at 1440p and we've gone from averaging about 70ish to averaging about 100ish and when dropping down to 1080p that performance change kind of tracks uh now as predicted before our CPU temperatures are way better because the loop isn't having to cool the graphics card anymore so that's a nice Improvement interestingly with doom Eternal there wasn't that much of a performance gain cuz I was starting to run into a CPU bottleneck apparently the little system doesn't like throwing out hundreds and hundreds of frames so the me G1 is a fascinating little system with a lot of engineering behind it but it does have a couple of quirks ow ow oh God it's hot one of the big ones of those is its price if you get it on Kickstarter now it's $1,800 for the version that I have in this video but its MSRP is $1,900 which is a lot for the performance capabilities of this system but considering the engineering behind it I do kind of get that it's going to cost a lot uh I don't know let me know in the comment section down below what you think subscribe to the channel if you like the video maybe watch another one a suggestion will pop up in a second and until the next video bye-bye [Music]",

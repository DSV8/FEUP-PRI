    "transcript": "huge thanks to our sponsors for making CES possible thermaltake Razer Phanteks Corsair and MSI hello good people I'm Dimitri we have the two camera angle one over here one over there it's our last meeting for CES and as usual we're gonna continue with the goofiness we're at Inwin this is the 928 my friends all right 928 I feel like it's going to be a little bit an extreme situation with this case because this has been designed particularly for the new Intel motherboard layout 14 by 14 inches you know what that means for ITX motherboards basically a little bit this somewhere there but 928 is an extreme case $899 for the price point so obviously in when tries to show off something different and unique and premium all the time and this is exactly that case as usual they're going the full aluminium route full aluminum panels and it's so thick it's so satisfying you know touching some plastic cases in the past and coming to this it's just like wow fully tempered glass panel really thick all the little notches and screws everything feels really good you know but of course for the price point you expect that you expect the premium and so you know the new motherboard layout here is all about water cooling so we have vertical GPU mount we have a really wide selection of the frame so you can install dual 420 radiators above the motherboard so that's kind of intense but the thing is you need two power supplies to power two to power that new into motherboard because of the two 24 pin connections and so in the back we have two power supply mounts one above another and they they look nice and you know tidy they're like a unit as for the front you can do three 120 s over 140 s not radiators here this is mainly for your like you know airflow column the same thing at the back and yeah the nine to eight from in when and $899 monster I love it and then we have the A1 the Inwin A1 plus so I love this enclosure because it's kind of like an all-encompassing one ITX form factor good air cooling you can still have a nice GPU with a big skirt underneath so you can have nice GPU cooling as well we have a built-in Qi charger that has now been upgraded from five watts to 10 watts which is awesome however they have made it now so that it's exposed the actual coil is there you can it's visible yeah I don't know how I feel about that the you know the traditional solution where it was kind of hidden I think I like that better but another upgrade here would be included a address about a RGB fan in the back so that's nice and it's all black now it's gonna also come in regular white and so the thing is the price point has increased to $199 versus traditional 169 but that is because the power supply has been upgraded from 600 watts bronze to 650 watts gold okay now that is what I'm talking about also another little update is the well they are they're calling it the skirt I feel a little uncomfortable calling a skirt in the case here but that has been slightly tinted to camouflage any little scratch marks and stuff because the previously it was kind of too clear so now any scratches that happen because it is plastic will be not as visible as before and the last enclosure we got is the Inwin 905 so I remember checking out the 901 I love the aesthetic approach to this whole like unibody aluminum frame so you know the the front is totally solid the top is totally solid and all the interior sections are kind of divided so you still have good airflow selection nice reach ability but the 905 really kind of you know refines that whole section so as you can see the tempered glass side panel is fully flat against the frame so there's a button in the back to release the panel but also I love the whole like emptiness of this bottom section here so it that is kind of your intake so we we can remove the dust filter and that's where majority of the intake for the interior comes from because as you can see the front panel is completely solid however there are fans in the front you can do 240 radiator there because the side ventilation is adequate enough so if you recall our H500 review from NZXT it's basically the exactly the same approach enough spacing about an inch a slightly maybe longer than an inch so that air can just get through it's not an issue and on the interior as you can see it has been sort of designed for water cooling we have a 360 rad at the bottom at 240 at the front a 120 at the back still everything kind of condensed into into this one area I like this design it's obviously very niche but if you know what you're doing then I think you you might enjoy building inside the 905 the power supply section is it's separate there's enough clearance above it so these fans have a little bit of intake as well aside from just the intake air from the front cavity over here and the back section is pretty nice the open lots of space for cable management so the Inwin 905 is going to be guess how much $280 so it kind of in the same ballpark as what they've launched the 901 and the 904 so it's kind of what you would expect but now it is refined and one more cool thing about this front LED panel so right now as you can see it is fully RGB you can change the color with the button over here but what they might be thinking of doing is adding an OLED panel so that you can plug that into the Asus motherboards asrock motherboards and actually display information because through that little RGB section either lighting or information which would be actually quite cool alright guys so that is the Inwin 928 the a1 plus and the 905 let me know if you'd like us to review any of this I'm really interested about the a1 plus because I think the upgrades are definitely worth it new power supply and you know the the really high-end stuff is really intriguing if you're you know really excited about that $1000 plus until motherboard thanks much for watching and yeah this is our last year's video it's been nice talk to you guys later bye",

    "description": "The Razer Blade Stealth late 2019 model is being called the first ultrabook designed for gaming.  It uses an Intel Ice Lake i7-1065G7 CPU and a GTX 1650 graphics card which should result in excellent battery life and benchmark performance.  But the price of this Blade Stealth GTX is also quite high now that its release date has passed.

    "transcript": "this is the new Razer blade stealth 13 more specifically the model that comes with Intel's newest 10 gen isolate processor my favorite CP of all time and a GTX 1615 max Q graphics card the rest of the specs includes 16 gigabytes of RAM and dual channel mode with an insane memory speed 512 gigabytes of nvme SSD and a 1080p IPS display the unfortunate part is that it's gonna cost you 1800 dollars that's a lot to ask for especially for a gaming laptop that doesn't really feature top to your specs now what really makes the blade self stand out from the competition is its form factor I think I'll get Razer the credit for actually implementing a GTX 1650 because as far as I know this is the only 13 inch notebook with a graphics card of that caliber so what happens when you combine an ice-like processor from Intel with this GPU let's find out but first a quick message from our sponsor the new cooler master master mouse 710 a weird name but damn this thing is good with an ultra lightweight body at only 53 grams for excellent flick control and aim correction the ultra weave cable is awesome for Wireless like feel the ambidextrous shaped for me personally is super comfortable and then like the shorter body plus the glide is smooth thanks to white PTFE feet enjoy the domination with an excellent optical sensor and despite the funky name the cooler master mm 710 is legit check it out the low alright so I just want to get some things out of the way before I talk about performance first thing is design and it's essentially the same as the previous model Razer hasn't changed anything here because it features the matte black anodized aluminum chassis that feels amazing but it is a fingerprint magnet this is still one of the best design Windows based 13-inch notebooks that I've looked at the keyboard layout remains the same I really wished erasers spent a bit more time re-evaluating their choice for implementing this confusing arrow key placement it's actually pretty annoying if you ask me also Mike had some trouble with the Enter key he thought that it was too small the keys still feel the same not the greatest feedback on a notebook but respectable it does feature Razer's chroma lighting but just like the old model it's not perky rather it's single zone across the board the trackpad is still excellent one of my favorite track bans on any windows-based PC the glass surface really makes a world of a difference when you're navigating through the UI and it also comes with Windows position drivers so gesture commands work flawlessly on this laptop seriously it is it is amazing port selection is pretty limited so on the left hand side you get a USB C 3.1 gen2 port that also acts as power in a type-a port and a headphone / mic jack switching over to the right you'll find the type C Thunderbolt 3 port that also functions as a power port and another type a port the speakers sound great they are front facing which means you get a good audio projection there's good fidelity in the higher ends I will say that it does like a little bit of bass but then again these speakers are still some of the best compared to some expensive gaming laptops out there the webcam quality is also pretty decent as you can see it's not the greatest but I think it's passable the 13.3 inch display is 1080p IPS at 60 Hertz beautiful color reproduction since it covers 100% of the srgb color spectrum these panels are individually calibrated out of the factory which is awesome one thing that I did notice is that the display is a lot brighter compared to last year's model also I did run my backlit bleed test and I did not notice any on the new stealth which is nice my only gripe is that I wish that Razer offered a high refresh rate display on the newer model just because it features a 1650 graphics card and in some titles it can push over 100 fans per second and that's something that I missed when I was actually gaming on this laptop that 60 Hertz definitely starts becoming a little bit of an eyesore in my opinion the included AC adapter is bigger than last year's model and that has to do with the power delivery because it's a hundred Watts versus 65 watts and that makes sense because this notebook has a powerful graphics card a 1650 to be more precise versus an MX 150 from last year actually it's not last year it's early 2019 because the older ariza blade stealth was launched earlier this year this is the newer version I want to say this is the late 2019 Edition in terms of upgrade ability the only possible thing that you can upgrade is the SSD the RAM is soldered onto the motherboard the nvme SSD itself is very fast in fact it's one of the fastest drives that have tested so far the battery size remains the same compared to the his model it actually lasted longer than the older model thanks to the power efficient isolate processor so on our light load test refreshing Chrome for 15 seconds the notebook lasted over seven hours whereas on our heavy load test running real bench on a loop the system lasted for two and a half hours I think that's very respectable considering the hardware that this thing packs and now the moment that you've been waiting for performance spoiler alert guys it's really bad but let me break it down for you you see a spur Intel spec sheet the core i7 1065 g7 has four cores and eight threads it comes to the base clock of 1.3 gigahertz and a boost up to 3.9 on single core that is all core boost is supposed to be 3.5 gigahertz but as I was running my tests multiple times I noticed the clock speeds were only hitting 2 gigahertz under a full multi-core workload to give you a little bit of context the previous model featuring the agent CPU was boosting to 3 gigahertz on all cores and reaching up to 4 point 5 gigahertz on single core so on paper the agency PU should be faster than the Tenjin CPU because of its sustained high clock speeds and that's exactly what happened as you can see with Sena bench r15 are 20 and even blender the 1065 g7 is slower than the whiskey lake core i7 85 65 you look at those single core results heck even take a look at the blender run the Tenjin CPU took more than three minutes to render compared to the agency view the higher Geekbench score on the newer stealth is likely due to the insanely fast memory speed because it's clocked at a whopping 37 33 megahertz these results are low and that's because Razer needed to use the 1065 g7 in its lower 15 watt spec to fit into a fin chassis with the GTX 1650 max-q that means it actually is performing at much lower speeds than the 25 watt version video editing performance is okay I took this 10-minute 4k project exported to resolve to a shaft at 65 and the system took a little over 10 minutes to complete that task I'm actually impressed by how well the GTX 1650 gets utilized because the difference is huge compared to the MX 150 found on the previous model considering the size this is very impressive here's a screenshot of the CPU utilization with this program the CPU is maxed out guys but just check out those clock speeds they're just really low I also ran our standard Premiere Pro rendering test on the new stealth and the system took close to 19 minutes to finish that and as you can see with the CPU and GPU realization Adobe still isn't optimized for the new eyesight processors the CP utilization is fairly low so is the new gen 11 graphics they probably still have to update the processor to take advantage of the new compute units on the integrated graphics with ice Lake so potentially maybe a software update could help fix that but for now it's really not optimized for content creation moving on to gaming performance it's pretty good provided you're comfortable playing demanding titles and medium to low settings these 1650 max-q is a great GPU for 1080p gaming and it's a welcoming upgrade over the MX 150 titles like battlefield one apex legends overwatch all ran really well at low settings far cry 5 and Shadow the 2 mater were playable but it makes me wonder if the CPU is bottlenecking the GPU but how does it compare to the old model featuring the MX 150 GPU well it's pretty significant if you ask me it's amazing to see this kind of performance coming out of a compact design taking a look at temperatures well the system ran very cool but that was not surprising since the CPU isn't boosting high enough the GPU only peaked at 68 C and the max clock I noticed was eighteen thirty megahertz so that's really good fan noise is very minimal right now in its idle state it's completely silent and even if I were to push a gaming scenario the system doesn't sound like a jet fan so that's really great so I guess this brings me to the conclusion and guys I had high hopes for this laptop because as soon as Ray's announced that they were gonna implement a gtx 1650 max queue in a 13-inch notebook my excitement level just sparked crazy high i was so excited to get this in the studio and test it out for myself i was also thinking maybe this could replace my editing workstation which is the blade 15 advanced because the form factor is so it's just perfect for traveling and all that kind of stuff but I think the biggest drawback for this notebook is that isolate processor it is just really slow compared to the riskily processor and I was expecting the IPC improvements to sort of make up for that but that wasn't the case because those boost clocks it just isn't that great I'm also wondering what the story would be like if Razer switched to comment lei because the specs on those lineup look a lot more promising compared to isolate because you get more cores and they boost higher so again I'm dreaming I don't think that's ever gonna happen but that's just that's my take so I don't think it's a smart choice to invest $1,800 on the new blade self because you can spend a lot less and get a lot more performance and other gaming laptops that are in the market right now and I feel like the new blade stealth is really targeted towards a specific type of demographic people will actually need that gain horsepower in a smaller form factor then again I would actually wait because Razer's are first to come up with a notebook in this form factor with pretty good specs except for that isolate processor so I'll just wait to see what the competition has to offer in the upcoming months but until then hold on to this or hold off to this that's I think that's a more appropriate way of saying it thank you so much for watching guys amoeba with hurricane axe let me know what you guys think about the new blade stealth are you impressed by performance disappointed I wonder your thoughts

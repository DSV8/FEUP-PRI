    "transcript": "- Tech News, It's what happens when an idea meets a thought, meets a computer, that can inspire a generation. Now get out there and live, go tech. - [James] How long do you spend on these? - I love tech news. Windows 11's launch was plagued by bugs, one of which caused performance drops on Ryzen processors. And after an initial patch, actually made performance worse, A second patch seemed to fix the issue. Well, YouTube channel Hardware Unboxed has discovered that that fix only applies if you plan to never swap out your CPU. - [James] I don't. - Well they tried, and well, the front fell off. I'm using that reference again. You remember that? - [James] No. - You never watched this skit, apparently swapping your current EMDC view for a different one, causes the L three cash issue to return, causing significant drops in gaming performance. The report was corroborated by PC boutique PowerGPU. And while there hasn't been any kind of confirmation from other sources or response from Microsoft or AMD, I feel confident another patch is incoming that will fix the fix that fixd the first fix. It's like they're coding these patches with an iFixit kit. It's like typing with a screwdriver or something. Figure it out. Roblox is finally back online after a lengthy outage that started on Thursday night and lasted deep into Sunday, causing many children to spiral into depression. Many people speculated that the outage was caused because of a promotion that Roblox was doing with burrito chain Chipotle. As the promo went live only around 30 minutes before the outage hit. - [James] Chipobla. - Chipa. But Roblox issued a statement denying the TexMex cuisine had anything to do with this. They cause lots of issues sometimes, but not here. Apparently the real cause of the outage was quote unquote. growth in the number of servers in their datacenters. Tried spraying it with server killer, it just keeps growing, it can't stop. Obviously server maintenance is a common cause of downtime, but it was a notably long outage, for a game that has over 40 million people playing it every day. - [James] Every man, woman, and child in Canada. - Will eventually live - [James] On Roblox inside a Roblox verse. If you own an EV that isn't a Tesla, you might be a little jealous of Tesla's network of Superchargers. - [James] So dope. - I wish it was James. Tesla's Superchargers can charge you up quickly and frankly, they sound way cooler than like Eco-Plug or whatever this special parking spot is called at your local Safeway. I don't want to park there. Up until now, you had to drive a Tesla EV in order to use Superchargers, but now Tesla is going to start allowing other brands of EV to use them. Starting out with 10 stations in the Netherlands - [James] The nether regions, the crotch. - We'll let you try it down there. You'll have to download the app and select \"charge your inferior non Tesla car\" to locate a station near you. If the pilot project works out, it'll probably expand elsewhere. And if it does horribly well, those Dutch had it coming. Now it's time for Quick Bits brought to you by Honey, the free shopping tool that looks for coupon codes so you don't have to. Whether you're browsing for shoes or ordering pizza, cause you don't have shoes to walk to the pizza place. Honey helps you save on sites where you're already shopping.

So get Honey for free right now at joinhoney.com/techlinked or click the link below. Quick Bits. They make the pain go away for a little while, Apple is planning to roll out a car crash detection feature for iPhones and Apple Watches, which will be able to automatically dial 911, even if you're incapacitated. This functionality has already been around for quite a while on Google's Pixel line, updating back to the Pixel three. - [James] Really? - Yeah, I didn't know that, but not everything has to be about competition. I mean, look at the iOS app store, - [James] No competition at all. - CaseLabs was a favorite among PC DIY enthusiasts for high quality custom cooling friendly cases before they went bankrupt in 2018. But now it looks like they're set for a comeback as the company is under new ownership. It's unclear exactly when they'll start selling cases again, but it's great news for folks who really like aluminum - [James] A flat. - and like saying it the right way. - [James] A dash slabs. - Okay slabs, Amazon's project Kuiper Q, cuiper, - [James] Que-ee. - sounds creepy, finally has a launch date, the fourth quarter of 2022. And it'll start sending up internet caring satellites to compete with Elon Musk's Starlink. Starlink, starlunk, Starlink already has more than 1700 satellites in orbit, but Amazon eventually wants to get over three thousands of its own up there, over the next 10 years. - [James] I love space junk. - More. I have no doubt Jeff Bezos will make it happen, he'll probably go up there himself to make sure everything's good, that would be cool. Careful though, space is dangerous. He could do it though. - [James] Yeah, Hell yeah Brother. - I'm wearing a cowboy hat now. Two popular tech blogs are closing their doors for good Hexus and Bit-Tech, both publications run by David Ross out of the UK have been used by us many times as sources on Tech Link. The sites didn't make it clear why exactly they're calling it quits, but it sounds like the staff will be starting a new website. So not all will be lost for loyal readers, from one tech news outlet to another, let's pour one out for them. - [James] Pass that for respect. - It would have been more respectful if I actually had a - [James] All right. - Hit F 12 to inspect. And scientists have created a new so-called 5D optical storage medium, that can hold 500 terabytes of data on a piece of glass, roughly the size of a CD. It uses nanoscale dots embedded in the glass that can be manipulated with extremely fast laser pulses. Right speed is somewhat slow at 230 kilobytes per second, but the medium is supposed to last nearly 14 billion years - [James] The age of the end baby. - and tolerate temperatures up to a thousand degrees Celsius. So we should be done writing everything to it by the time the heat death of the universe happens or another earth develops, I guess, is that what you're saying? Could that, is that science? - [James] Asexually by budding. Better in this episode before that happens though, so come back on Wednesday for more Tech News, it just keeps happening. Never stops.",

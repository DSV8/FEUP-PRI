    "transcript": "- Some great news, VirtualBox now supports nested virtualization on Intel processors. At the end of 2018, they started supporting nested virtualization but only on AMD processors. So for the whole of 2019, we had this discrepancy between AMD processors and Intel processors. VirtualBox nested virtualization was supported on AMD but not on Intel processors. But at the end of 2019 that changed. They now support nested virtualization on Intel processors as well as AMD processors. Now I'm gonna show you how to get that working. However, there's an issue in my experience using the graphical user interface, you can't check the box to enable nested virtualization in version 6.1. So I'm gonna show you how to enable that using VBoxManage. So essentially, we're going to run a command line command to enable nested virtualization. Why is this important? Well, nested virtualization allows you to take one hypervisor and virtualize that hypervisor within another hypervisor. So as an example, here I have got Windows as the operating system installed on a physical laptop. So in this example, I'm running Windows 10 on a laptop. I've got VirtualBox as the hypervisor running on top of windows, and inside VirtualBox, I'm running Linux. And inside Linux, running inside VirtualBox inside Windows, I'm running the QEMU hypervisor. QEMU is a Linux based hypervisor that allows me to virtualize appliances such as Cisco routers and switches. So in my example, I'm running Cisco IOSv routers and Cisco IOSv layer two switches, within QEMU, within Linux, within VirtualBox, within Windows. Now you may say that's really inefficient, and it is. It's better to run what's called a type one hypervisor, such as ESXi and run a hypervisor directly on hardware. But that's not always possible, and it's not always the best thing to do. I'm sure you probably don't lug a huge server around with you, when you go traveling. You probably have your laptop, and that laptop may be running Windows or it may be a MacBook. So you have a operating system already installed on hardware, and what you wanna be able to do, is run Linux or another type of operating system within Windows or within macOS. But what this allows you to do is it allows you to virtualize other hypervisors within VirtualBox. Fantastic benefit that was only available using applications such as VMware Workstation Pro or VMware Workstation player. That's now changed, opens up a whole new range of applications to us, fantastic news. (Upbeat music) Everything must end - Now before I show you the devices running in the network, let me show you the settings in VirtualBox. So this GNS3 VM is currently running, so I won't be able to change the settings but under system processor, notice this checkbox. Enable nested VT-x/AMD-v. That option was not enabled or available in previous releases of VirtualBox. I'm currently using VirtualBox 6.1 once again on a Windows computer. If I have a look at this Kali Linux virtual machine, go to Settings, system processor, notice this option is grayed out. I found that even though it's possible to enable that option on VirtualBox, you can't do it through the GUI. So you need to use these commands. I'll put these commands below the video so that you can copy them. Basically, on Windows, you need to go to C:\\Program Files. So I'm gonna open up a CMD prompt. I'm gonna go to the root directory, go to Program Files, go to Oracle, and go to VirtualBox. So, remove that prompt. That's the full command. I'll clear the screen here, and then I can use the command VBoxManage list VMs to see a list of virtual machines in VirtualBox. And the one that I wanna change the virtualization on is that one. And the command to do that is VBoxManage. Modify the VM. The VM that I wanna modify, and then I use the option nested hardware virtualization on. Now before I press Enter, notice it's not currently enabled. So once again, Kali Linux, settings, system, processor, this is currently disabled. But when I press Enter here, I'm told that the settings have been changed, and I'm gonna reload the settings. Notice it's now enabled, and I could disable it or enable it. So you need to enable it through the CLI. I found that in Windows as well as on a Mac, you need to enable it through the CLI. On my Mac as an example, I have the same issue that I need to enable this through the CLI first. I can now enable it and disable it through the GUI, but I found that you need to use VBoxManage to enable this in VirtualBox 6.1. Okay, so going back to my Windows computer, I could once again disable it by using off here through the CLI. So type the command and specify off, and notice system processor, it's now disabled. And once again, I could enable it that way, reload my settings, and it's now enabled. So that's how you enable nested virtualization, in VirtualBox version 6.1 on a Windows computer. Similar kind of command is used on a Mac. Now I'm gonna show you a practical example of using this, where I'm nesting Cisco operating systems within Linux, within Windows, on my Windows laptop. Okay, so in this example, once again, I've got a Windows 10 laptop. We can see it's a Windows 10 operating system installed on an ASUS laptop. We've got an Intel processor, i7, eight gig of RAM installed on this laptop. And what I'm doing here is running a VirtualBox, and at the moment, I have GNS3, which is an application that allows me to virtualize Cisco routers and switches running within Ubuntu within VirtualBox on Windows 10. I'm actually connecting to this laptop using VNC, from my Mac. I've put the laptop in a different room because of the noise that's generated by the CPU when running all these devices, but once again, what we can see in the GNS3 VM here is KVM support is true. That never used to be possible in the past when using an Intel processor. So looking at GNS3, I've got an Ubuntu docker container connected to a Cisco IOSv switch, connected to another Cisco switch, connected to another Ubuntu docker container, and I've got two Cisco routers in this topology. I can connect to the first docker container on the left as an example, and use the command ifconfig to see the IP address of this device. Now, you may prefer using IP address. That command is not supported in this docker container, so hence I'm using ifconfig. IP address is once again this and I can ping the second docker container that has this IP address through my Cisco switches. So on the second the docker container, ifconfig shows me IP address of this container is that. This is Ubuntu once again. So if I type uname -a, we can see that this is an Ubuntu Linux docker container, and I can ping 192.168.1.1. In other words, the two Ubuntu docker containers can ping each other. These are virtualized Linux hosts running within QEMU, which is running on Linux, which is running within VirtualBox, which is running on Windows 10, on a physical laptop. Now on my switches as an example, here is switch one show version, shows me that this is a Cisco switch. So we can see here show version, Cisco IOS, vIOS layer two advanced enterprise is the version of operating system running on that switch. So that's the switch on the left, let's have a look at the switch on the right. So switch on the right. Show IP interface brief. We can see that interfaces up, so Gigabit 0/0, Gigabit 0/1, and Gigabit 0/2, which are these three interfaces on the switch. Other interfaces are down because they're not plugged in, Show CDP neighbors, shows me that I have a router connected on Gigabit 0/2, the router's interface is Gigabit 0/0. That's this router. I also have switch one connected on Gigabit 0/0, and it's using Gigabit 0/0. I can have a look at the router as an example. So here's my router, show version, shows me that I'm running a Cisco IOSv router. Okay, so there you go. That's how you enable nested virtualization on Intel processors using a VirtualBox 6.1.

    "transcript": "YouTube is the second largest search engine after its parent company --- google But do you know, when it started in 2005, it was actually meant to be a dating website? Hi there, this is mrinal once again and welcome to RTT video cast. We use YouTube everyday, Right? So why not use it effectivly So her are 10 less know YT tips and tricks that you may have not heard of So lets get started: ===== #1 Loop a Video So, Yesterday, YouTube has finally added the long awaited -- loop feature Simply right click the video, you want to repeat and then, click on loop. So, now you can repeat your favorite soundtrack without having to download a browser extension Although, it's interesting to think, what took them 11 years to add such a simple feature. #2 Search inside a channel So lets say, you stumble upon a new YouTube channel, but before subscribing to it you want to know, how many videos does the channel has on your fav. topic. To quickly do tha, click on the search icon and type the keyword. You will see all the videos, they have on the particular topic. Obviously, you can do the same thing, by typing the name of the channel followed by keyword, but this save some time. #3 Bold comment Ever wanted to stand out in YouTube comment, well you can always do that by by typing in *bold* _italice_ and -strikeout- format. On a related note, avoid typing your email or website address, in the comments section chances are,. it will most probably end up in spam category (even if you can see it) instead use dot and @ in square bracket or something. #4 Use YouTube resources Now, this one is pretty obvious if you are YouTuber but the rest of you, may not be aware of it. So, if you ever need royalty free songs or sound effect for your video project simply go to YouTube audio library. Anyone can use them for any type of project, even commercially. Similarly, if you ever have to edit your Videos asap consider the build in video editor on YouTube To be honest, it's pretty decent and have all the features a beginners would need. #5 Pause a video If you want to pause a YT video what you do is press a space bar, Right? But, more often than not, it works as a page down instead of pausing the video. Now, I dont know about you, but this happens to me quite frequently, So, what I do now is, I use k key. to pause video. The advantage of that is, even if your YT player is not selected (like if you have clicked outside the player) it will still stop the video. Now, it may look like a small tip but trust me, it makes a huge difference, when you put it into practice. #6 Find the unsearchable stuff There are some really good movies and audiobooks on YouTube but most of them are uploaded as -- unlisted so you can't find them via regular search. But if you go to, the subreddits like fullmoviesonYOUTUBE or full audiobook on Youtube you can find the fresh list. which you can also filter acc to your taste. And since, these groups are run by thousands of members you will always find something interesting everyday. #7 YouTube kids If you have kids in your home who love to watch YouTube then this one is for you, Now, some of you might not know but YouTube has dedicated app for kids And, It has everything a kids app should have like, a clean interface, parental control and tons and tons of video that are made especially for children. . Apparently, its not available outside US so you may not see it, on app store But, you can always side the apk and get it working. #8 Picture in picture YouTube mobile app has a great feature called picture in picture effect. This lets you search for videos while the current one, is still playing. Now, if you want you can get same effect on PC using a chrome extension called Picture in picture effect. This extension was release just a week ago, and its still in beta but, it works really smoothly and is, getting quite popular already. #9 YouTube buddy I think, quite a few YouTuber follow this channel and if you are one of them then get this YouTube buddy asap. So, this is a channel management toolkit and come in some very powerful features. Some of them are-- batch file and replace bulk copy of annotation or youtube cards You can see what tags other people are using how many times the video was share on social media and tons of other useful features Overall, if you are youtuber you should definitely give it a try. . #10 control YouTube on PC from smartphone. Now, some of you may not know, but you can control youtube on PC or smart TV from your smartphone without using any third party app. To do this, go to YouTube.com/tv and then go its setting. Once there, pair up your smartphone. For this to work Both, should be under same WiFi network and this it, once you sign in with your account. You can just lay back and control your videos on your PC from a smartphone. ======= Well, this is all for now, let me know how many of this feature did you already know. Also give this video a thumbs up if you learn something new or thumbs down is you don't. And like always thanks for watching.",

    "transcript": "- You guys, I am so excited to tell you about this really cool project that I just did with Xbox. And I'm sure many of you have heard about Xbox Game Pass, but if not, it's subscription where you get access to hundreds of awesome games each month and you can also play them on PC or mobile. Thank you to Game Pass for sponsoring this video and having me host this show that I'm going to tell you about. It's called Signature Rigs and in this episode, we build a completely custom PC for Karl-Anthony Towns. - What the hell? (laughs) (upbeat music) - This is wild. - This is definitely the biggest gaming PC that we have ever built. (bomb explodes) - I'll put a link in the description where you can check out the full episode, but first, let me take you behind the scenes of how this all went down. For those of you guys who don't know, Karl-Anthony is an all-star basketball player and also an avid gamer. Now, the first step was finding someone who could build a PC that would have the amazing wow factor that we were looking for. Now, obviously we didn't have to do that much thinking because Austin Evans is a no-brainer. He has done so many amazing builds on his channel that I thought that this would be, you know, like a really easy build. Or so I thought. - Let me be clear, I don't want us to do that. - Okay, we're not. It's a bad idea. It's a bad idea. Just kidding. So the next step, after Austin agreed to take on this project, I had to chat with Karl-Anthony about what his current setup is, what he ideally would be looking for in a dream PC build, and how we could help make his PC dreams come true. Now, I really wanted to make sure that we were putting everything together that was on his wishlist. I asked him a ton of different questions about his play style, his favorite games, what kind of games from his childhood that he liked to play, and which games from the Xbox Game Pass library that he might like for us to preload on his new PC. Since, of course, we're going to have to give it a test once he gets it. So, you guys know that I'm a huge Sea of Thieves fan and I was actually really shocked to find out that he has never played it before, so I can not wait for him to get his PC so that we could play it together. So, now at this point, I've got the intel and I gotta give the news to Austin. We did a bunch of brainstorming to try to figure out what would be the coolest way to deliver the highest performance PC, but in the most shocking way. So, we had all kinds of crazy ideas. We were also throwing around the possibility of putting a shoe inside of the PC and I said, you know, Austin can do anything. So, it's possible. He said he wears a size 20. - So. I guess we can build a PC inside the shoe. That would be a way to go about it. - That's actually a good idea. See, I was thinking shoe inside the PC, but then maybe the PC is actually inside of the shoe. - I feel like we actually could do that. But then, I feel like, does anyone want... Like, is that cool to plug a bunch of ports into the back of his shoe? I feel that might not be (laughs) that might not be the approach. - I think it would be cool. Spoiler alert that didn't happen. But what did, is something that Austin and his team worked so hard on creating. This is unlike anything that I've ever seen in my entire life. They had so many issues, that at one point we were really nervous that they weren't actually gonna be able to deliver this thing on time. - [Female Voice] Check it out. - What the hell? (laughs) - [Female Voice] It's crazy. - That is a full-blown contraption right there. - So, Austin went through so many hurdles to make this all actually happen. So, Austin and the rest of your team, everybody who worked on that, congratulations. It is so beautiful. It's so shocking. I mean, it's just something that, it's really an art piece. A normal PC build is very simple, but this is completely just unlike anything that you'll ever be able to just go into a store and ever purchase. I guess, as Karl-Anthony said before, he's like, you know, I will let the artist take the lead and Austin, that's pretty much what you did. - I've never been called an artist before, but this is definitely the biggest gaming PC that we have ever built. So, not only just in size and scale but in performance. I mean, this thing is loaded with the most high-end specs that we can possibly get our hands on. I had call that a few favors to get a couple of the parts actually here on time for you. - Well, I'm very excited and it's funny enough that the PC I was just playing on with broke, so this is perfect timing for me. It's perfect timing. (Austin laughs) - Straight to the garbage. You've got a new one now. (mellow music) - What the hell? (laughs) He wasn't lying though, when he said big. I was expecting like maybe two, three PC cases together big, but it's like a whole art piece big. - So, after you guys watch the episode, I would love to know what you think. And would you guys like to see us build another one of these? If so, which celebrity would you like to see us build a custom PC gaming rig for? Leave 'em in the comments below and I will see you guys in my next video. (mellow music)",

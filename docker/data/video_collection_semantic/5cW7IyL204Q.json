    "transcript": "(exciting music) - [Krazy Ken] Wait a minute, what is this? Holy shit! It's like getting buried under snow, it's like that scene from National Treasure when Nicolas Cage found The Charlotte. Whoa, this is it! I'm gonna have to go down to the lair and do an Installation Sensation of this plaque. You may think that's not even possible, how can you possibly do an Installation Sensation of a plaque? Well, you've underestimated me. I will find a way. (chuckling) (high-pitched beeping) (techno music) Well here it is, in all of its damp glory. Frickin' winter, just trying to ruin everything. So, it's a little wet, no big deal. But guys, we did it, you helped make this possible. And now we're gonna reap the reward. Now, I was smart and didn't bring a knife. I do, however, have a paperclip from a previous tech video log. And that shall do, there ya go, see? That's all you need, flip it over, do a little paperclip action on this side. That actually cuts really well. Must be really easy-to-cut tape, or just a really strong paperclip. Here we go, open the case. And a little more tape has to be taken care of there. And bon appetite! We have a luxurious piece of foam, that actually might look good on the wall too. And this nice letter, very nice stock. This isn't like a typical 8 1/2 x 11, you know, this is a nice stock with a nice texture and a nice bit of thickness, and a card as well. \"You've just done something that very few \"YouTube creators accomplish, you had an astonishing \"100,000 people subscribe to your channel. \"We know that numbers on YouTube can get really big, \"but we hope that you don't lose sight \"of the reality behind that six-digit milestone.\" Yeah, that is pretty important. Whoa, this is cool. And Susan, the CEO of YouTube, I'm sorry, I don't really know how to pronounce her last name. (attempting to pronounce \"Wojcicki\") Oh, I'm gonna get a lot of hate for that one. I apologize for not saying the name correctly. And we also have a card in here, from Rick. \"Congratulations on your subscriber milestone, \"we are honored to take part in \"recognizing your achievement, \"and want your experience to be exceptional. \"This award...\" Okay, award, reward? I keep, some people say award, some people say reward. It's like no one can agree, what is it? Grammar, aw it's a bitch. \"This award was inspected and packaged \"with great care by Rick.\" Well thank you, Rick! You're my new best friend. \"If your award was damaged during shipping \"or if you have any questions, please contact us.\" Fantastic, and now... The box is trying to steal the spotlight. And now, ladies and gentlemen, for the first time, we will look at the Computer Clan 100,000 subscriber plaque. I have not seen it yet, you have not seen it yet, no one outside of YouTube has seen it yet. This will be the first time we all see it at the same time. Let's count down from 10,000. Just kidding, three, two, one! Boom, there it is! Super shiny, and this box is causing a problem now, hang on. I'm gonna have a little boxing match, if you will. (chuckling) Wow it is cold! Holy balls, it is full of condensation because it is so cold, but there it is! Holy shit! Whoa, like I'm just kinda letting it... Set in there, you know? \"Presented to Computer Clan for passing 100,000 subscibers.\" There it is, this is frickin' real! Holy shit, guys. Hang on, let's take it out of the condom unit. Man, this, it feels like some kind of metal. I mean it looks like brushed metal but it feels like metal too, it is really cold. Oh I thought that was a scratch for a second. There was a hair on the mirror part, I thought it was a scratch, oh thankfully it came right off. Yeah, nice brushed metal with my fingerprint there 'cause it's so cold. And a shiny, chrome-y mirror part. You can do your makeup in this thing now, like this will be my mirror now. I'm just gonna kinda lightly polish this boy up. The condensation is taking over. Oh goodness me we need to get this at a good temperature. Yeah, I don't know what this crud is on here, you see that? I don't know if that's damage or if it's just dirt and I can scrub it off, but I'll get to that later. Yeah the moisture kinda took over but luckily they included a super dry desiccant packet. Alright desiccant packet, c'mon, work your magic and dry that shit up. Well we'll have to give it some time to think in the corner over there. But yeah, it's looking pretty good. Nice brushed metal look and feel. But yeah, that's nice. We need to do an Installation Sensation with this, as per tradition on this show. So, I brought my friend... The hammer from, you remember that episode? The one where I went all How To Basic on that hard drive's ass? Yes, this is that exact same hammer. (grunting and hammering) I brought him back as a guest star in this episode. We're gonna do an Installation Sensation of this plaque. No, I'm not gonna smash the plaque. What I'm gonna do is hammer it to the wall, that's all it's gonna be, it's gonna be a simple Installation Sensation. No software updates required, we're gonna do this and it's gonna be fine. The only this is, I budgeted for one nail, but I am now discovering there are two nail containment fields on the back. I'm gonna need to double my nail budget. So, I'll get on the horn with my accountant and see if the quarterly fiscal will cover that, and then we will try to escape the lair, go back to my normal office, and do an Installation Sensation of this super shiny, very cold plaque. Back in a jiff, hopefully. Before I proceed, I just wanted to take a closer look at the potential anomalies. Yes, right there, there is some crud there. Now, I don't know if that's damaged or if I can just kinda scrub that off. I really wanna be careful 'cause I already lightly touched the shiny part to wipe some, I don't know where all that dust came from, maybe it's from the lair, but I tried to wipe some dust off and there's already a small scratch on there. So yeah, it's like the back of an old iPod, it's that polish that just scratches super easily. Now I know that, but hey I guess it adds character. As cool as it is, I didn't expect it to be 100% amazing quality, you know? I mean, it's given to you for free, so you gotta be grateful. Ooh that's a nice bevel-y feel there. It has a 3D feel to it and that's nice. But yeah, Rick, I'm not sure if you missed something. I dunno if your designer missed something, because your card isn't even center-aligned, but it looks like there's a little bit of a defect with this plaque. So I'll reach out to them and just see what's up. If they have a suggestion on how to clean it, I'll just do that, but it would be best if they could replace it 'cause it does look really dirty. I mean, worked hard for this, I would like it to be clean, you know? And it just looks kinda filthy. You can really see it when I angle it. In the reflection there you can see those speckles of grime or something. I don't know, everything else looks good though. Alright so, that's my inspection, Rick. Let's see what you have to say when I message you. But in the meantime, we'll do an Installation Sensation. Okay according to my calculations, the first nail should go in right about there. Now all I need to do is find the nail I probably carelessly threw on the floor. Uh-huh, yeah that's going really well so far. Where did I put the frickin' nails? Wow, I feel like a dumbass. Shit! Alright, nevermind, we found it. (chuckling) It's been one of those lifetimes. Alright, go for precision, little bit of an angle. And a light tap to get it started. Alright. (hammering) These are probably really (censored) big nails for what I'm doing, but it's all I could find. (hammering) There we go, let's see. So that'll hang, kinda like right there. So it's right about there. Keep it level, so let's say right about there. Alright, nail number two. Oh good, Krazy Ken DIY channel, I just had a big nightmare about that. That would be something. (hammering) Oh shit. (chuckling) This baby got a little loose. Okay, I'm gonna start on this side then. I never said I was good with my hands. This could be an ad for Home Advisor or some bullshit. Like, \"You tired of (censored) up all the time?\" And this other hole's just gonna get covered up anyway. Here we go! And it's slightly crooked, that's great. But good enough for government work. I actually have something I wanna talk about. So there's kinda two special things going on right now. The first thing is, yes, you guys helped me, helped the Computer Clan, get past 100,000 subscribers and this is proof of that, so thank you very much. But there's something else kinda going on that's special. I'm not crazy worried about this being a little crooked right now because I'm not gonna be here much longer. I'm moving to a new place with a studio space attached to it. So I won't be filming where I normally film anymore. Yes, my character is stuck in a lair but I'm breaking the magic right now. Yes, I film in a studio. And I'm about to be moving to a different one, so this plaque is gonna be coming down in a few weeks anyway. And again, you guys came together and helped me grow this channel to 100,000 subscribers so thank you very frickin' much. And some may not know this but we're one of the longest-running YouTube channels on YouTube. We didn't grow as fast because, well honestly when I started this, I didn't really know how to grow it. I didn't take it very seriously until really only the past couple of years. But we've been around since '07, we were early adopters of YouTube. And I've made a lot of good memories along the way. And I hope you guys did too. I just wanted to get one more good look at it. And yes, it'll be moved soon. And I'll show you guys where it sits once we move to the new location. But yeah, there we are. \"Presented to Computer Clan \"for passing 100,000 subscribers.\" That is a big win right there. And it's a nice mirror, I can do my makeup in the morning just by looking in this mirror. And also, I did contact Rick about the damage on the plaque. I still have not heard back. So to be continued on that end. But for now, this is still a great accomplishment and this is pretty to look at. Thank you guys very, very frickin' much. Catch the crazy and pass it on.

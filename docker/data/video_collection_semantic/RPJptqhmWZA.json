In fact, the LG Gram 2017 is the lightest full laptop I've ever tested (Chromebooks and Yoga Books don't count) - and though it's a little on the flexy side, the durability that comes with that flexibility makes me a little more forgiving than I'd otherwise be.

    "transcript": "[Michael] If you've been paying attention to Microsoft, you'll know the company recently made waves with the Surface Laptop, a new notebook with the style to appeal to college students, a locked down build of Windows to appeal to their universities, and a spec sheet that shouldn't impress either of them. Meanwhile, I just wrapped up two weeks with a super lightweight notebook that outdoes the Surface Laptop at almost every turn, and for around hundred bucks less. I'm Michael Fisher. This is the LG Gram for 2017, and this is the Mr. Mobile review. Okay, so there are a lot of different versions of the LG Gram, and the one I got in for review sits at the lower end of the spectrum. It's model 13Z970, with the 13.3 inch IPS display that's not a touch screen and also isn't all that bright, but there's a daylight mode to compensate for that. Other corners have been cut too. That display's only full HD, which is serviceable but looks a bit fuzzy after a few months on a Surface Book. I know, I'm spoiled. Also, there's no Windows Hello to unlock with your face or a fingerprint. You've gotta key in your password the old fashioned way, and the speakers are bad. You ever accidentally leave your headphones plugged in and you keep jacking up the volume, wondering why the sound is so distant? Yeah, that's these speakers. (upbeat music playing) But compromises like this are unavoidable when the computer you end up with is as light as this one. The Gram weighs in at just over two pounds. That's 1.7 pounds lighter than the hulking mass of the Microsoft Surface Book with Performance Base and about the same weight as Apple's Macbook, light enough that I sometimes had to check my backpack to make sure I didn't forget it at home. The casing is magnesium alloy in an easy to smudge white finish, and while it's thin, there's a panoply of ports here, HDMI, 3.5 millimeter with DTS Headphone:X processing, and three USB 3.0 connections, two type A and one type C. There's also a microSD card slot, handy if you wanna quickly transfer footage from a phone or a GoPro, and one of those nice little details I like, a hard drive activity light. Takes me right back to the glory days of my first PC. The LG Gram runs Windows 10 Home edition, which the combination of a Kaby Lake i5 and eight gigs of RAM runs pretty well. Now, I'm a pretty Google-heavy dude so I tend to do most of my work in Chrome instead of Microsoft's Edge browser, and I'm the type of guy who keeps a lot of tabs open at once. That makes the fans spool up a bit more often than they might if I used it more judiciously, but they're fairly quiet, and despite all that inefficient use, this thing gets outrageously good battery life. On its first charge, I took it on an epic working marathon that saw me scripting in Google Docs, sending hundreds of emails and Slack messages, and doing a lot of Chrome surfing. I kept the screen brightness between 40 and 60% and I was connected to wifi the whole time. Under this kind of usage, the Gram took 12 hours and 40 minutes to give up the ghost. That's about half again as much staying power as I've ever gotten from the Surface Book. Road warrior test passed. I held off on reading other reviews until this video script was almost complete and I was surprised by how many reviewers were underwhelmed by the Gram. To be sure, I share their complaints about the slight flex in the cover and the kind of mushy keyboard and track pad. I mean, after a few days on the Gram, typing on a more expensive machine again was definitely a relief, but to me, these are fair tradeoffs. Ductility makes for a good drop resistance. More on that in a second, and there were bound to be button compromises on such a thin laptop. One thing I think everyone agrees on, though, is that the hinge is not the place for a webcam. This low placement will make even your skinniest friend look like a half melted human gumdrop and whoever put it here is mean and should feel bad. A few more dispatches from the department of details. LG's software control panel looks every bit like a program last updated in 2012, but it's also got some handy utilities, like manual fan controls and a whole bevy of touch pad gestures. My favorite is the single finger side scrolling. For such a portable machine, it would have been nice to see an equally svelte charger, maybe even with USB-C, but instead, you get a bulky brick with a proprietary pin. Back on the upside, it's cool that even an ultra lightweight like this lets you open it one-handed. This machine wasn't designed to run bleeding edge games at hair on fire frame rates, but during my time with it, I really had to abuse it to get it to bog down or lag. LG also stresses that it's super durable, and to test that claim, I threw it off every desk I have in the studio, and yep, it's still chugging. The LG Gram is not alone in what my colleague Daniel Rubino calls a sea of great laptops. In fact, it seems a direct response to the Dell XPS 13, which sports nearly identical battery life, but the Dell is a pound heavier and a hundred bucks pricier than the Gram, at least if we're going on sticker price. If I were in the market for a Windows powered ultra portable, I'm not sure the LG Gram's plain looks would catch my attention on the store shelf, which is why LG should offer bonuses to salespeople who can make shoppers pick this thing up, 'cause once you hold it in your hands and you see just how light a two pound laptop really is, well, it's something. When you tally that up with surprising durability and outstanding battery life, you've got a machine that seems custom built for the mobile lifestyle, a machine that's also a fair bit cheaper than the Surface Laptop that's about to suck all the air out of the room. You've seen a lot of the Surface Book with Performance Base in this video, and if you missed my review, it's a two parter, it's a big one. Go back and check it out, and please subscribe to Mr. Mobile on YouTube so you don't miss more mobile tech video every week. Until next time, folks, thanks for watching, and stay mobile, my friends.",

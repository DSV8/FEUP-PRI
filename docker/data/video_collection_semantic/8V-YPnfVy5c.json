    "description": "You can buy a gaming notebook as a desktop replacement but what are you giving up in terms of performance?  To see what you can buy off the shelf, we're using two identically priced & VERY similarly spec'd prebuilt gaming systems, the Legion T730 and Legion Y740 notebook.  And yes, we know you can build a custom PC for less but neither of these products is trying to compete with a custom PC.  :)  Buy these systems here:   Legion Y740 17\":   Legion Y740 15\":   Legion T730:    Subscribe    Review units were purchased by Hardware Canucks.

    "transcript": "well hello there well today my good people we have an interesting competition that is about to happen in front of me are two identical expect machines from Lenovo and identically priced to would like put in $50 difference so one of these is gonna go to mic one of them is gonna go to Eber they can do their own testing and we all can see what the experience is like owning one of these machines boys take it away we didn't want to bring up something pretty important to you and that is both of our systems are similarly SPECT the only difference is that you have desktop class components and I have notebook components now in terms of pricing that's that's something interesting because even though the we are partially sponsored by Lenovo and this video is sponsored by legion we actually went out and we purchased these ourselves we always been like 5 grand yeah grand Canadian right just to give you an idea his system ended up costing us around twenty two hundred dollars and the same thing with mine except mine was about thirty dollars more than than his so considering the pricing and the specs it's gonna be really interesting to see how these two align with one another but there is something else that I know that you guys are screaming at your screens about right now because most of you guys build your own pcs these are or at least my T730 is for somebody very very different it's for people who don't have the time or who aren't really inclined to build their own pcs it's one of those pre-built systems it comes out of the box it's ready to go you just hook it up to a monitor it's even got a really basic mouse and keyboard but if you're interested in building your own custom PC you can check out my how to build a gaming PC video right over here and if you're interested in buying either of these systems links will be in the description down below so what we really wanted to do here is not only test performance from one system to another but also from an experiential standpoint so this is actually gonna be one of my first experiences with a pre-built system and it's true actually it is you have enough experiences with notebooks so I think I think we're gonna split up for a next couple of days and then we're gonna meet back here with the benchmarks can't wait to compare those numbers let's go alright let's go so it's been a few days we have got our fair amount of time testing both systems and you can actually see that my girlfriend has sort of been busy with the all the decoration all day decorators there's a beautiful Christmas tree on that side of those just and we're at way and we're at my table again like I'm in a Christmas shopping mall I've got my new book all ready to go and where's the desktop well oh wow alright that is a monster but you know if this wins portability no it does not so I think what we wanted to do is we wanted to start right away with the perforce numbers because neither of us has seen each other's performance numbers we put them together yeah you know offline and now we're just gonna sort of combine them and see what's what's going on yeah but there's an irony here I know why do you have your notebook open because you're supposed to well you told me a screen in front of my face wouldn't have been very inviting and it wouldn't have been good for your composition Michael you're not getting my point my point is my notebook comes with a screen but the desktop does not know yeah it doesn't know get it all right so what are we gonna look at here we're gonna look we're gonna start with general performance yeah general performance yeah we're gonna start with general performance oh oh okay all right well I think we're I'm not surprised because looking at these first numbers the the desktop does win but not by as much as I thought yeah because if you look at Cinebench and even you know both are 15 and are 20 both in single core and multi-core I can't tell if there's a major difference they're only off by 10% which is amazing considering how a notebook CPU competes with something like the 97 okay now do keep in mind that I have more threads compared to the 9700 Kay yes but Santa bitch loves threads well next up we are talking about drive speeds so you have the fastest SSD which again not by much by about 5% maybe yeah and and surprisingly my one terabyte hard drive is faster than yours what yep yes yep it is faster but it's the same isn't it the same Drive no it is not I do have a 7200 rpm Drive I just happened to find that my right speeds are faster than your read speeds which is did you happen to look what do i do have not really moving on to some real-world tests we're gonna do blender and again guys I am surprised easy but again there doesn't really seem to be a big huge difference except well look at the premiere I was just about to bring that up like my notebook destroyed your desktop so does that mean that the IGP was in well yes it was but you don't for some reason on the desktop no I from what I could see there was absolutely no way to enable the IGP even though it has one integrated I went through the BIOS and went through Lenovo Vantage ok so you did battery life but you know this No that is a point to bring up I am gonna bring up that point why because if I run out of power which which we have in the last couple of days actually why we didn't have one of our reviews up in time yeah so so so you know the fact that I have a battery so that I can still run off of a battery power source is pretty amazing whereas on your desktop side you're out of luck if power goes out then the whole system is up so you lose everything and you never know alright so now it's time to take a look at gaming performance you ready I'm ready all right let's do it Wow well you got the Polish number one taking a look at actual games you do have the edge man like that 97 under K at that sustain high clock speeds and the 27 e yeah Damo here what kind of sacrifice you're making with the max-q design you know technically the specifications on that are TX card are the same it's really the clock speeds that are lower so there is a serious edge right now for the desktop system but to give it another leg up lenovo allows for overclocking on the k-series chip so what I ended up doing is there's a little switch inside of Vantage that allows you to it says overclock the CPU or overclock only during gaming I just flat out overclock the CPU my clock speeds actually went up in multi-threaded workloads from around 3.9 gigahertz all the way up to in between for point three to four point four gigahertz so and looking at these results I'm gonna have to bring these up onto the screen right now and say look they did improve from a real-world testing perspective and Cinebench r15 but at the same time gaming performs didn't improve all right so to conclude the performance between these two systems I have to be honest I'm very impressed with how far the Nova can catch up the desktop pc i'm horrified i wanted this thing to be so far ahead i mean typically when you think about performance you typically go towards desktop systems because they're generally a lot faster than notebooks but the fact that you can get that all in a portable package is pretty amazing so i like that i I like it too but I don't because there's one thing that I wanted to bring up and that's the silence of this system the same can't be said about this thing okay so we've already talked about performance the desktop is the clear winner but we did want it to go a little bit past that to kind of walk you through what are some of the pros and cons of having a notebook and having a desktop and I'm gonna start with the exterior the looks so Mike what do you think of your desktop PC personally I love the looks I mean it looks like microwave yeah but I mean I think we're I think now we're just gonna be talking about really obvious things right yeah I mean I love the lgion why 740 because it's very minimalistic not to gamer II I mean I've got ports at the back that's conveniently accessible which is nice I will find is conveniently accessible because you have to reach around the screen first of all first of all let's be honest I have a USB type-c port which supports none of all three I have no USB type-c ports none see that's a that's a major problem I think that's one of the things that I saw in mind its quantity of USB type aids over quality of inputs and output all right Mike oh you ready for this this rapid fire round I've got speakers and they sound amazing this notebook has a dedicated subwoofer and it's probably one of the best sounding systems on a laptop I've got I've got no now speaker which I had to purchase separately but there you go I've also have a display it's 144 Hertz 1080p g-sync I mean it's an all-in-one package how about you you need to use your notebook your your your your notebook to talk about but okay so I think I think that also has a lot to do with lifestyle right is I like having a separate PC for a desktop and then a really really thin and like portable nor notebook like this x1 so the next thing that we need to talk about is a great ability so I'm going to start with a notebook it's fairly easily accessible so you've got two memory slots can be aware 32 gigabytes there's only one m2 slot that's already populated by the Windows drive but unfortunately I really wished if they added an extra n dr. slot because it's a 17 inch laptop in the first place and there are other notebooks in the market with that configuration now the two and a half inch hard drive bay can be swapped for an SSD if you want something a little bit faster and that's about it you can upgrade the CPU you can't upgrade the GPU but I think that's where the desktop comes in yeah Lenovo allows you to upgrade a couple of the components number one is the GPU the GPU is on a tool as bracket and can just be pulled out and easily replaced the hard drives there's one additional caddy that has a hot swap adapter you just push in another hard drive and you're good to go the other area that can be upgraded as the memory but with 32 gigabytes and this one you probably don't want to do that the one thing that I was really hoping for is another m2 slot because I've already come up to almost the maximum capacity of that nvme drive I would have liked another high-speed storage option on the Z 370 motherboard all right so I think it's time to conclude this video and I think we're gonna find a winner or at least I think we're gonna fight for ourselves to find a winner because I'm unhappy with this guy I'm happy with this guy we're gonna keep you talk with adaptability and I think that goes to the notebook why because it's an all-in-one package you get a display a really good display and it comes with a keyboard speakers it's it's an all pal it's an all-inclusive package you can gain comfortably on it you can edit videos if you do want to do that and it's portable which means this comes with you wherever you go where are you okay hanging around with like 15 pounds on you well if you go for the 15 inch version of the Wyson 40 then that that can be easily disregarded and I think from an adaptability standpoint I want a gaming desktop and a less expensive but very efficient notebook and that for me is my definition of adaptability well next up we have upgrade ability and that clearly goes to the desktop whereas with a notebook it's very limited finally we have performance or second last we have performance and I think the desktop takes the edge once again it does but it's not as much of an edge that I actually thought was gonna be there it's 25% better but it also shows how powerful those notebooks are becoming now the last category is value and I think this clearly has to go to the notebook why because for the same price as we Specht out as I want to refer back to this mind my point earlier is that it's an all-in-one package you get a display get a keyboard where it's the desktop you to invest in additional accessories like a display like a keyboard and a mouse maybe but at the same time for me value also has to do with how quiet the system is it also has to do with that upgrade ability factor so I think what we're coming to a conclusion of here is that it really depends on what your lifestyle is or not I mean I'm gonna be honest man I'm I'm pretty happy with this notebook and I'm sorry I think this is desktop so I don't know how are we supposed to sell this now all right so let's go uh tails is this guy all right heads is yours okay all right fingers crossed if that would go in there yeah my boy Wow all right I guess that's it desktop that concludes this video thank you so much for watching guys and let us know which one you would prefer yeah thanks so much for watching and we'll see you in the next one are you trying to like static clean your no but I don't want to well it's I'm so hopped up and that's where the another shark Athena",

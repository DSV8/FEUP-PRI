    "transcript": "Alright, so right now you're wondering what exactly is going on. I might be included in that. I'm also kinda wondering that. But I do have a product today, and we're gonna test it in an unconventional way... ...because, we're Canadian. The company's called \"AmazFit\" and the tracker is called \"Arc\". It's got a heart rate monitor on it. I'm hoping it's kinda durable. It also says on the back it's IP67, so, water resistant. Dust, rain, splashing. How about ice?! Actually, kinda sleek. So it's got a clock on it as well. \"Move Beautifully!\" I gotta hit the ice first, we'll see how beautiful it is. Also evaluate the beauty of Tom. He's coming out of retirement for this video. If that doesn't deserve a thumbs up, I don't know what does. Tom, give them a thumbs up. Look at that! Here you can catch a closer look at the heart rate monitor on the bottom. It's also got a traditional watch-style band, which I like. That baby is magnetic right there, look at that! This guy just...look at that! Oh! Footsteps, heart rate (well, obviously there isn't one right now), battery life, and back to time. I like that! Simple! You hardly even notice it there. Maybe we'll do a few challenges out there, what do you say, Tom? Sure. Let's get out there! Let's get out there! It's what I've been waiting for...many years. The time has finally come...the TEST...of all tests. Will the fitness tracker stack up...to a hockey player's needs? Oh! And he's going up! Oh and it hit the post going up! Look at that! That could be - that's me right there! Doug Gilmour \"Username 'Doug Gilmour' not taken\". Alright, that's a special day right there. Tom, when's the last time the Leafs were actually good? Like, Doug Gilmour, that era. They lost to Wayne Gretzky! They lost to Wayne Gretzky! You essentially put in your height, your weight. \"Touch the button to confirm\". Oh check it out! See? Boom, confirmed. This is how you play a game... Not funny, man. So on here, you're gonna have your steps, your sleep data. Set your goals, change your units, so on. Tom, what's a good heart rate for exercise? 220 minus my age? That would be your 80% mark. Ok, so, around, uh 190. It's a lot easier to do some cardio that's fun to do than you sitting on a bike, what are you doing? You don't wanna be on that bike! You're staring into nowhere! What are you doing? Do we do a check? Let's do a check. I tell people. Hockey is some serious cardio, man. What other sport do you have 1 minute shifts? In some cases 45 second shifts. Hockey's a sport with, like, natural interval training. You come out, go hard full clip, one minute at a time, the heart rate goes down, you do it all over again. I'm like the ambassador to hockey right now, the ambassador to Canada. I got water bottles on the bench, what are they full of? Maple syrup. That's right. Ohhhhhhhhhh! OHHHHHHHHHH!! Wooooo! I got that ticker ticking! Tick tick tick tick tick! I'm in that range. Tom says I'm burning fat right now. You calling me fat? Take a step back! Alright, so it's challenge time. At the end of the rink over there is a tiny little water bottle, which you can probably barely see. It's right over there. And then Tom and I are going to slide a few pucks down there. First guy to hit it, wins. Wins the internet. Wins a thumb, in the right place. That is a tiny target, man. Oh, f-cks sakes! Jesus! Oh! That's much better than mine! OHHHH? No... Aghhhhh! That was Tom's attempt number 3. Aghh! I keep going too far to the right! Aghhhh! Ohhh, that's not bad. Oh! OH! Get! Get! Aghhh! OH! Ohhhhh! That's it! THAT'S IT! OHHHHH!! AGHHHH! I'm having a Matrix moment. I need to bend the spoon right now. Miii - Ahhhh! The spoon isn't real. The SPOON ISN'T REAL!! REAL!!! Oh my!! The spoon is real! The spoon... isn't... REAL!!!!! Real! The spoon is not real! OHHHHHHHHHH! That was clean! That was clean! Crossbar. We're gonna try to hit the cross bar with a slap shot from here. Hopefully Tom does a little bit better on this one here. Yeah. For Tom in the last challenge, the spoon was very real. See the Matrix. Hit the crossbar. Not the Matrix! OHHHHHHH! That's my first shot! That's like the trick shot thing, it was on my first shot! When the bright lights are on, it's your Uncle Lew, baby! That's who! So another thing about this fitness tracker right here is, it's IP67 water resistant, right? Now, does that - is ice included in that? Oh! Hahahahaha! IP67, let's find out! Oh it's still ticking! 515 steps. You're - you got a lot of water on that lens! Alright, so what did we find out? Besides the fact that the spoon is definitely not real? We found out that this little guy can actually hold up to hockey, which, in my opinion, has gotta be one of the most rugged sports out there. It's very slim, so it doesn't interfere at all with my movement. I don't even notice it actually, when I'm playing. We tracked the heart rate. We got it up to, what, 170 plus? That's kinda cool. You see where it spiked? We see the average, as well. Is \"The Arc\" hockey-ready? I don't know, I think we found out. We also found out a few other things. Don't play hockey if you can't see the Matrix. Get out here on the ice surface. Stick a water bottle at the end. We'll find out who's the one. Yo, thumbs up if you want another hockey video. This was too much fun to do it. There's 15 seconds, we're down by 1. He's coming down the ice. He crosses the line. He sees the net! He lines it up!! And got it! In the top corner! I'm out of here!",

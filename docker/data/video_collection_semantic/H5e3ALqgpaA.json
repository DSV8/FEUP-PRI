    "transcript": "My inbox is full of opportunities to review everything from furnace filters to off-brand smart locks to an endless army of Bluetooth speakers and battery banks. And usually, I ignore all of it. But for the last month, we have indiscriminately said yes to everything for two reasons. Number one is that we're hoping to find some incredible diamonds in the rough. Number two, everything else is gonna be really funny. Hey, optimus, be cool. It's supposed to reply to you. Hey, optimus, roll out. Optimus. Kicking things off then is the Transformers optimus prime elite core edition from Robocen. Hey, optimus. Roll out. This is the transformer toy that you dreamed of as a kid. Whoa, that is so fricking awesome. I love him. Whoa, there's all kinds of actions. Oh my God. You can even add custom actions. You can make your own by doing like a block diagram of each motor and what position you want it to be in. That's be cool. Optimus, you don't have to do anything to be cool. Hey, optimus prime. Roll out. Whoa, build redux. Tired of choppy performance and inconsistent frames, build redux will level up your gaming experience with a new PC built to your specs and shipped directly to your doorstep. Make the ultimate gamer move and check them out at the link below. The price, 700 US dollars. That's a lot of money for a Tickle Me Robo. But I mean, for a kid, even a 45 year old kid, this is a pretty out of this world toy. I would say the words, hey, optimus prime roll out. Can you not? Next up, we've got the phone that swallowed your phone. Holy crap, this thing is thick. It's got everything. Type C for charging. Got your lock and volume control. Got your SIM and micro SD expansion. Oh, still no headphone jack. Is this just a battery case on top of another phone? It looks like it's over-molded over a regular SIM slot. So many cameras, AI music. What is AI music? This has an iPhone screen protector on it. It has a cutout for the notch and it's like not the right size for it. What the hell? Like this is a weapon. Of course, its claim to fame is not the actually surprisingly decent looking screen or over 10,000 milliamp power battery, but rather the 123 decibel speaker that is sticking out in a giant wart off of its back. According to one chart, that is just two decibels lower than pain begins. Well, it's definitely painful. Yeah, not because it's particularly loud though. I mean, credit where credit's due. It's loud for a phone, but it has AI music on the back twice. How could it fail us? Yeah, once you go past about 60%, it just completely loses any semblance of balance. It's only 150 bucks though, but it comes with a MediaTek Helio A22 Dimensity chipset. So it's a four core from 2018, four gigs of RAM and Android 12. And I would sincerely doubt that you will ever get any kind of update beyond that. Took a while to launch the app. Oh, you know what I mean? Hey, it's David. Oh, David makes, David looks good on any camera. Not on this one, sorry. Oh, that's pretty rough, yeah. Yeah, no, no, it's not. David's not the problem. It's not gonna be any better with me. Yeah, could use more smoothing. You know you're not supposed to use the same soap that you use on your body for your face, right? Just different soaps. Next up is apparently some RC cars, which are, oh, cobotics? You can get red, blue, silver, black, or nothing. And then you just paint it yourself. Each car comes with a headset. Oh, no way. These are first person view with headset cars. 149.99. Oh, wait, did it only hold the phone? You actually nailed it. Did I really? 150 each. Wow, cool. Let's try it. Here we are a day later, and we have finally got a direct wifi connection between the phone in here and the car right there. And that's not bad in terms of latency. I mean, it's not amazing. Yeah, it's usable. Well, maybe. I guess I should try driving it. Oh, trace. Oh, God. Put it in front of your head and then it'll be your vision. Oh, oh, that's actually brilliant. It's only a little better. Okay, whoa, whoa, okay. If I accidentally tilt it, it feels like the whole world is falling away from me. Okay. Don't get sick now. We have the rest of the video to make. What's the range on this thing like? Man, I'm on the TechLinked set. You're on the TechLinked set and you can see just fine? I mean, it's a little blocky. I wouldn't describe it as just fine. Engine is cooled down. What the, and performance. Oh, hi, Adam. Hello. There you go. Oh, God. That's so nauseating. Why would you do that to me? I'm sorry. You cannot navigate this thing at full speed. Hi, Linus. I have two different takes on this. One, as a tech reviewer who knows that this is a lot of technology for 150 bucks, I'm like, wow, that's really impressive. But from a, this is my real money that I actually paid and this is the experience I get standpoint. Why don't we talk about the laser? Yeah, about this. The comments on Yvonne's AMD Ultimate Tech Upgrade made it pretty clear that without an extraction hood and a tinted cover, you basically shouldn't use these because at best you might go blind and at worst you might inhale some bad stuff and I don't know, go blind, go dead. Our health and safety committee said, no. Oh, we can't even turn it on? They said, please don't. This is a class four laser, which means that even reflections can cause permanent eye damage. What about these glasses? Those I believe are not properly rated, so he said no. I see. They look cool though. I mean. Go ahead, just say it. Taste is subjective. Cool. Okay, and how much is this thing? $2,000. And are we covering it? On short circuit, Tynan's gonna do a full coverage of it. That's a weird way to say that. How about something that's a little bit more down to earth? This is the Gravistar Supernova. It's a Bluetooth speaker and lamp. I mean, you know what? I kind of like it's style. The plastic molding and the intricate paint is actually really well done. It's a really cool knick-knack and the RGB is also relatively tasteful. I mean, yeah, I think it looks really cool. It's got like that vacuum tube or nixie tube kind of vibe to it. Yeah, and you can change the settings. We have three different RGB settings. I guess if you include off, it's four. Bonus feature. No, it's on my phone. That's a really cool speaker. It sounds okay, but because it's a down firing speaker, it really depends on the surface you put it on. And I found any sort of soft surface completely muffles it and it sounds a lot better holding it. It still doesn't sound very good, dude. Are you a bass head by any chance? No, not really, but. Okay, because that's the only way that I could say that it sounds anything other than like, butt. I've heard a lot of, a lot worse Bluetooth speakers. Here's something that I didn't understand about this because it was prominently featured in their marketing materials. It comes with a hook. A hook, so you can be that guy. Yeah, I know, they're like, put it on your backpack. In style. I mean, these legs are not super, you know, hanging off of a bag friendly. Yeah, I know, they'll just get caught on stuff. How to be a tool and look like one too. Just have this hanging off your backpack while you're hiking. Playing music to keep the bears away. What is a little bit more bag friendly? Is their cute little GAN nitride charger. What does that have to do with anything? He's small. And he's a charger. Yeah. I mean, okay. How much is this thing? I'm guessing 250 bucks. 180. Yeah, okay. It's a hundred dollar knick-knack with a $40 speaker in it. And you pay 40 bucks for having both of them in one package. There is so much stuff. Oh yeah, I know, man. This could be three videos or we'll have a bunch of extras on flowplane.com slash LTT. Okay. This is a laptop stand. Oh, okay. No. It stands. I mean, maybe with a laptop on it. That's pretty cool, Will. Hey, that's on there. It didn't like. What? What is this? This is the IKKO ITX05 13-in-1 full stack docking station. Full stack. It's full stack, man. It's full stack. It's got the bottom and the top of it. It's a type C dock with a speaker in it. And a DAC. I was actually really looking forward to this thing because this is like the exact perfect thing that would fit on my desk. Has amp-dac combo in here. Can power some of the headphones that I listened to. Whoa. Okay, that's pretty cute. Dual display, quad USB type A. You get a couple of USB Cs. There's a power delivery input so that you can actually charge your laptop while it's connected to it. Ethernet. And then of course, if it's a DAC, it's gonna have a headphone jack and then also a balanced output. And optical. No microphone jack. So that's a yikes. What is the deal with this port up in the top? I think. Is this the intended use case? That really doesn't seem right. Wireless charging? I mean, it's got this. What is this? I thought maybe headphones. That's the only guess. I literally have no idea. Headphones? Then it would be female. No, I mean like your AirPods charging case or not your AirPods, but my case is too tall. Oh, I can get it in there. Oh, sorry. But also we can listen to some Hi-Fi headphones. Ooh, Hi-Fi headphones from BGVP. What is this brand? How blatantly did they rip off the B from Bang & Olufsen? That's what I'm saying. Ooh, a faux leather carrying case. Wow, those are loud. Design wise, they're quite loud. Does it come with any other size of ear tip? It does. That's the default ear tips. Yeah, I mean- And they're very, very large for default. Maybe they're like a Holland focused company. Do they sell a lot into Holland? Well, they just- Canals? No, they're just like really tall there. Figure if they're tall, they might have big ear canals. I mean, I'm tall and my ear canals are very small. My doctor says I'm an abomination. They include so many ear tips. What are these made of? Are these just like a resin mold? It's wood. Shut up. Yeah. Well, it's gotta be some kind of resin impregnated wood. It's resin cured wood. Sure, okay. So it's resin. I mean- With wood in it. Yeah, but the actual interior is wood too. If you think they have a lot of ear tips, just wait till you hear how many drivers they have. Seven. There's nine in each ear bud. That would explain why they're so big. It has four balanced armatures, four electrostatic tweeters, and one 9.2 millimeter dynamic driver. They go in like that? It took me a little while to figure it out. Oh, that's unintuitive. So David, you said you liked the look. Do you still like the look? Why does it have them in your ear? I think you have them wrong. There's no way that's right. The cable was on backwards. I like how they look. I like the jade kind of aesthetic. I can tell you they have excellent noise isolation. Like I don't need active noise cancellation on something that's that much of an earplug. Ooh, it has the thing. Look, shut up. I use it. I agree. A cinch is awesome. Helps a lot. I know it looks ridiculous, but it really does help a lot. This is one of those products that's either $120 from some weird Chinese brand or is like $2,000. And I have no idea which one I'm looking at right now. Plug into our balanced jack here. What kind of DAC doesn't have a volume knob? A touchscreen DAC. Ooh. Ooh. Oh. Wait, hello? These sound great. I know, right? They sound really good. They're pretty uncomfortable. I'm not gonna lie. Because they don't really sit inside your ear, they're basically just hanging all of this weight off of your ear canal. $799. You're pretty close. $899. Okay, all right. I'm trying to unplug this. And this whole piece of the DAC is like coming apart. I mean, I guess you don't want your balanced jack to be too loose. What about the price for this guy? $199. $476. Oops. Nope, see you later. I hope you weren't listening to that music too loud because you could lose your hearing. Uh, no, I was okay. In the event that you do, you can try the Liner Nova. Yeah, because when you're as old as this guy, that's the time to start protecting your hearing. I mean, life starts from hearing. Woah Oh, they look cool though. These definitely look like rip-off AirPods. That is, speaking of hearing damage, that is extremely loud. On each bud, there's a tube. On each bud, there's two buttons. Okay. Lower the volume. Mm. Mm. Oh. Okay. Oh, ow. Ow. They're for people that are hard of hearing. Yeah, yeah. So at level one, you're unpleasant. That's just in general. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ha ha. Oh, and then this is just USB-C power aux-in so you could hook it up to your TV or whatever. Exactly. And these bridge the gap between wireless earphones and a hearing aid type product, I guess. Yeah. To their credit, for an off-brand AirPods clone, this is actually a pretty compact case. Have we listened to music on them? Do they, I mean, they're not audiophile headphones, but like, they sound kind of decent. And then I'm gonna pause my music. And then how does it, can you hear me really well now? Oh, okay, it took a second, but yeah, it's kicked in. I can hear myself. I found that if I do like, all right. Oh, whoa, it was in this ear and then it was. So I think what it's trying to do is that if it goes, you hear a really loud bang on your left, it's not trying to boost it so that you get deaf in your left ear. Yeah, okay. It's canceling it out, but it's really sensitive so that if I do this, you hear it. I can hear the echo. Yeah. It's not the snap. Yeah. Because of the delay, I can tell it's the echo off that wall, interesting. It's canceling this ear cause it's going, oh, that's a loud noise. Yeah. It's not, that's gotta be like 500 bucks. $407. I could see people buying this and being extremely happy with it. Oh, it's time for a door lock. Door lock. Cheeto. These guys don't exist on Amazon anymore. Oh. So I'm assuming it's just like a quick in and out weird. Okay, but if they were, then you would put this cable through this hole. Yeah, we can get batteries in there, right? Whoa, it's on. Wait. Oh God. Why would you want it to be like that? Is this, are you, are you intended to put it on the door like this? There's a USB micro B in the end of this handle, but it uses AAA batteries. You can connect it to an app. What does that have to do with the micro B USB port? I don't know, factory resetting it. I'm trying to find that. Is this a fingerprint sensor though? It is. I would definitely trust this with my fingerprints. Oh, if the batteries are drained and you don't have your key. You can just plug in a battery bank to power it temporarily. No, it's, it's a solution. Hey, it's a handheld gaming PC. AOKZOE. Well, how the hell am I supposed to pronounce that? Dicks. Wow, Ryzen 6000. Play some GTA 5 boys. Boom. That was all it had. Wow, these joysticks are nothing special. Neither is this D-pad. Ooh, that D-pad is truly awful. It's specially awful. What is this, a keyboard shortcut? Just do yourself a favor and enable the real keyboard down here and then just touch it down here. It's a lot better. This is really annoying. I can't even select this text field. Oh, the password I can, but the account I can. Ooh, it has RGB though. Look at this, the handles are glowing. The handheld gaming on Windows truly is an unfinished experience. That is Valve's big advantage right now. Oh, and it's gone. The software is really, really bad. Well, it's non-existent is what it is. Yeah, I don't care. Just launch the game. Sorry, the new version of this console that they're releasing at the same price has, is gonna be the first console to market with the 7840U, but that's basically the Z1 Extreme. Got it, got it, got it. Okay, it's not light, but it's pretty ergonomic for the size. Like, it's not hard to hold onto. I actually quite like the shape of it. Micro SD slot, two USB-Cs, which is really nice to see. That's something you won't find on either the ROG Ally or the Steam Deck. That's a pretty looking display. Not the brightest I've seen. And it's a huge, eight inches. That's really big. It's not even that loud. It's not quiet, quiet like the Ally, but it's reasonable. Okay, I mean, software aside, I don't mind the hardware for this thing. And I like the color scheme. It's pretty. How hard is it for guys like this to compete now that the ROG Ally exists? Oh no. 859 and over $1,200 for a terabyte of storage and 32 gigs of RAM. That's, the ROG Ally software is not perfect either, but it has some. They made a battery brand for you, Cuktech. Okay. Okay, to my knowledge, nobody has actually had sex with Yvonne since we got married. And I certainly didn't watch. So, no. It's just an energy you give off. 40,000 milliamp hours though, with this kind of big battery energy. I mean, I don't think she'd look elsewhere. There's something, sorry, are they being cucked or doing the cucking? I'm not sure. I don't, maybe they're just like a cucking technician. They're just there for support during the whole event. Anyway, there's a humor to me that this is called the P plus series. All right, I think we're done here. See you later. That's okay. I'm no longer interested in the price of the Cuktech. I found me a much more satisfying. Meet the Omni Charge. Can power it up here. It's got a little display, three USB-C outputs. One of them is in slash out. Oh, okay. That's the charging one. Does this do USB PD? Yes, it does. It also does AC out. You can charge it via DC. It comes with a wall wart. That's a GAN 65 watt charger. And the total capacity on this bad boy, 6,400 milliamp hours. Is that it? At 22 volts. Oh. So, if we're talking what most people measure it, it's closer to 40,000 milliamp hours. Okay, about the same as the Cuktech. But look at that temperature monitoring and everything on here. It has a hundred watt DC in and out. So it can save your power brick. It also acts as a hub for file transfers. I trust it. But how much does it cost? It costs $450. Yeah, you're paying a lot for those premium features. Goovis. No, no, wait. No, I wanna do Goovis. Are you doing Goovis? Okay. You can't put stuff in front of me and expect me to not open it. Okay, you're gonna do the Goovis. Goovis. Ooh, Goovis goggles. Wait, is Goovis a slang I'm not familiar with? It's just the stupidest word, Goovis. Do I look like a Goovis? Absolutely. This is just one of those personal home theater things, right? Yep. Okay. That's probably about equivalent to a 120 or so inch screen at, you know, about eight, 10 feet. There's a lot of light bleed around it. I'll tell you that much. And the flip up does freaking not work at all. It just drags it down. There's no middle strap. So there's nothing to kind of hold it in place. There is a clip for a middle strap. I actually, I have no idea where that is now. That never made it over here. Apparently that's user error then. Yep. 42 pixels per degree. Wow. Most other brands only have less than 20 PPD and the equivalent of an 800 inch screen. It's like sitting at IMAX with 3,147 PPI. No, don't, you just, you're getting ahead of it. You're getting ahead of yourself. I want to plug it in. You're good. I have a whole thing planned. What the hell is wrong with you? Look at these IPD adjustments and you can switch between 3D and 2D. Brightness adjustments and everything. This foam, not great. Goovis. Goovis. Linus, Linus. I'm glad you're having a lot of fun with your Goovis, Linus. I'm really happy for you, but you gotta, you gotta slow down. I work with a child. Wait, look at that. What? You know what? We got the Goovis and a seat. Oh. Anda seat. I'm dead. Magnetically removable thing. Got the padded bolsters, which is kind of nice. At least the, yeah. You don't go straight through to the wooden bottom. Yeah, as long as you don't weigh too much, this should be reasonably okay as far as gaming chairs go. This is actually the XL version. So it's four people between the heights of 5'11 and 6'8. Any feature you can find in the secret lab, you can pretty much find on here. Cool. It's a $600 chair. $600 chair. Yeah, that doesn't surprise me that much, given the features. The other thing that we got was this sick racing stuff. No way, this is part of the say yes to everything? Yeah. Mosa Racing. I've never heard of them. Neither have I, but apparently they're actually quite well liked in the racing community. Tivy has given his badge of approval being kind of our resident racing nerd. Brakes a little stiff, and we don't have any way to brace this. I got you, fam. No, just hold on for a second. Are you kidding? This is how we're doing this? This is not how this works. The whole table's moving. My chair's on wheels. Smooth casters Have you felt the buttons on these? This feels fricking amazing. What's janky about this? Nothing, actually. Moza's actually killing it. I was super impressed with everything that they have. These joysticks feel amazing. Wow. That screen actually looks pretty good. This is kind of awesome. Okay, well we're gonna add the next- The force feedback is kind of fricking awesome. My brakes don't work, which is less awesome. We're gonna add another level to your simulation. Wait, what? The feeling of air blowing past you. Wait, what? Move your head forward. What the hell is happening? You're about to get air conditioning from your car. Ah. Is this that thing we did the sponsor spot for on Tech Quickie? Because we took a bunch of flack over it, but I tried it and it was actually pretty good. This would be helpful on a hot day. Oh yeah, no, it works really well. I think their talking points were really stupid. There was something, something like AI controlled fan, whatever the crap that means. That was dumb. The actual cooling cannot be denied. There's touch and vibration and you can use them as speakers. Admittedly, I don't have a ton of experience with racing wheels. I have tried some pretty nice stuff in the past. This feels pretty damn nice. Do you like Mr. Bean? Um, Teddy? Nah, I can't do the Bean voice, but. What? What? Teddy, it's Teddy. Well, remember that episode where he brushes his teeth while driving a car? So we got a toothbrush? Yeah, an Oral-B IO9 toothbrush. Oral-B reached out to us, what, for editorial? Yeah, okay, here you go, we're coming in. We haven't talked about pricing or what? What the hell is wrong with you? There's no water on it. lttstore.com. There's some water. That's a lot of toothpaste. Well, I gotta keep these pearly whites looking great, okay? So as you can see, as I brush your teeth, it detects how much pressure I'm putting on your teeth. Uh-huh. It can give a red or green light based on the amount of pressure. Okay, well, let's talk about the overall price of this racing setup, and then we can, maybe you can guess the allocations. I bet this is at least like $3,500. But the Goovis thing on your head is $900. This is $900? Yeah. For $300, you know, they might have my attention. This thing's, I think, like $350. I think I remember that from this one. It's $400. Yeah, which is a lot. The racing setup is $1,500 total. That's it? I mean, considering that it's $500 for Logitech's cheapo version. Yeah. This is at least three times better than that. And then the Oral-B toothbrush is $299. Okay, whatever. Squarespace.

    "transcript": "- Hey guys, how's it going, it's Justine, and today we are checking out the Google Clips camera. Now this little thing was really interesting when I first saw they announced it. It's been out for a little while now, we're gonna test it out. This is an AI camera. So basically you place it around your house and it is supposed to recognize people that you would want to take pictures of, which sounds (chuckles) super, super creepy now that I'm saying it out loud. So when it syncs to your Google Photos, it basically uses machine learning to learn the faces of your friends, and people that you've taken pictures of so that it knows to prioritize those people when the camera sees it. It sounds so creepy. So there's no actual internet connection in the camera itself. It only will connect to the phone that you have it synced to. So for me, of course I'm going to be syncing it to my iPhone and you have to download the Google Clips app, and from there it'll take you through the set up. It doesn't really do video with audio. It basically is just shooting 15 frames a second in photos and that'll stitch those together to create a seven second video. I haven't even unboxed it yet, so let's do that first. So this thing definitely isn't inexpensive. It's $249.00 which I feel like is kinda pricey for whatever this is. Granted it's not a normal camera and there's a lot of tech built into this thing, so I guess that's why it's so expensive. Oh ooo! Oh it's very cute and man do I love this teal color. I think this might be a new color that I'm gonna be getting into this season. There is a little button so if you do wanna take photos manually, you can just push that back right there. And here's the little clip. So it's kind of like a little squishy, plastic here, so it is what it says it is; it's a Google Clip, you can clip it onto things. It's also not meant to be a wearable camera so it does work best if it's placed around your house not on your body. Anything else that I'm missing? Some instructions, \"Let's get started\" - I should probably look at these cause I don't know how to use it. So in case you guys didn't know, it tells me where the lens is (chuckles). Thanks for the diagram. So there are little LED lights that will pop up whenever it is recording. Where's our charging port? There it is; USB-C. I wonder if it's charged. So I also got this. This was another little addition. This is the Incipio Tripod. So here's the problem. Think I mighta got tricked. There's no tripod with it! Apparently it is just a protective case with tripod mount so if you were thinking that this came with a little tripod, you'd be deceived, much like I was. But don't worry, I've got plenty of tripods, it's just I really thought that it would've came with one. Let's set this up. Press the button, okay it's on, oh there it is. \"Clips looks for friendly faces. Your camera automatically captures when it sees a person or a pet.\" Oh. Okay so we're going through the updating process. My camera's up to date - that was super quick. That was way faster than I thought. It says my camera's ready to use. \"Twist your lens clockwise to start capturing.\" There's a little line right there so when you line it up with that dot - can you see this? Can you see, can I see me? Can you see, can we see ourselves? So it's already, it's been taking pictures and I didn't even know it. So here's the picture that I took. This is me hitting the shutter manually so it takes 15 frames a second, and it gives you a seven second clip video. It's kind of like burst mode when you take photos on your phone, and you can scroll through it, and you can pick the one that you like. So if I'm like wow that's a good shot, I like that, save it. So right here this will actually let you save GIFs. You can do an MP4 video, a live photo, or a GIF which is pretty cool - I've never actually made a live photo before from any other app other than my iPhone. So let's take a look at that - let's see it. Let's see, oh my. So there's the picture that I took. Oh this was the one that I screenshotted. So there's the GIF. So that's my first test of Google Clips. I'm gonna set it up around the house while we film today. We're having a big shooting day. We're probably shooting like five or six, or seven, or eight, or hopefully 10 videos, but I'm not sure if that's realistic or not. Nick's like. So I'm gonna come back in a few hours later and do kind of like a little recap, and see what we actually have captured with the Clips. (mellow music) So it's now several hours later. I've been moving this thing all around the kitchen so it's got a bunch of different shots. Some of me, some of Nick, some of me and my sister making videos, some of the dog. So I'm gonna show you some of the shots that this thing got today and after using it, and kind of looking through, it's kind of a neat little device. Yes granted at the beginning I did say it's creepy, it is kind of creepy cause it just sort of does its own thing - it really does have a mind of its own. And not only does it have a mind of its own, it has a developing mind. It's constantly learning. Okay here are some clips. This is from a future video. Let's go in and we're gonna edit it, and it definitely got a good shot here. I tasted something that I made and it made me actually disgusted. So that's me being sick, saving the photo, let's go into motion, save it as a GIF - this is so great. Oh this is when I was feeding my dog dinner. (chuckles) This is kind of weird to go back and relive what I did today. Oh look at that. Making his meal. Here's Jenna putting away one of the toys that we played with. This is kind of fun. I'm, this will be fun for like parties. I put the camera in the cage so here's Matty. I'm gonna save, I'm gonna save that photo. I'm gonna, I'm gonna save, oh no let's GIF this because he looks super cute. Oh here's me trying to get a shot of where I had the camera placement. I'm reliving my day. This is so strange. Oh my gosh this is crazy! - [Nick] I think it's in auto-balance. Yeah. - Wow you're right! Look at that, that did actually a very good job. - Yeah it's pretty impressive. - Wow! I am really into this actually. Oh I'm having a good time, this is fun. So the total time capture is about three hours and then you have to recharge it. So throughout the day I just kinda plugged it in here and there, I don't think I ever constantly had it fully charged 200%. But with that being said, I feel like I got a lot of shots and I'm not sure if this is anything that's really that interesting, but going through this, it was kinda cool to relive my day through clips. It was also kinda cute like putting in the cage so I was able to see little Matty, what he was doing, and get kinda some cool pictures. So I feel like this is something that you're gonna be able to get a perspective that you normally wouldn't. So what it does is it strings together all of the photos into sort of a seven second video, and from there you can create GIFs, you can create live photos, you could also choose stills from there to save. So this is really fun and I can't wait to play with this a little bit more. I also would love to try this at a party situation, kind of have it set up sort of as a photo booth so people could just come up, and if you wanna press the button you can, and it can take some shots. Because it is AI and it's always learning faces, that way it could learn all of my close friends in one day. So I'm like guys listen, you gotta come over, I've got this thing, it's a little camera, and I need it to learn my friends, and they'll probably would not be surprised at all cause they're like okay Justine, whatever, we're not surprised - you wore a camera on your head for six months straight so this is a walk in the park. Make sure you guys are following me on Twitter, at Instagram, and Facebook because I will probably be posting my followup there. I'll definitely be posting photos and videos from this thing, and I'll definitely, definitely be posting GIFs. GIFs, say it with me now. - GIFs. - GIFs. - No! Get out! No don't get out, you're filming! Stop, stay, please! Thank you guys for watching. I will see you guys in my next video. Make sure you guys subscribe, like, whatever the heck everybody tells you to do at the end of the video - just, just do that, or don't do it, I won't even know. But that's it - I'm gonna go and be creepy. See you later.",

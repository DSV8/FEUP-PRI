    "transcript": "this is my Steven Seagal impression well Tom what would you say Steven Seagal If he was here right now hey man, behind this door is an incredibly hot environment just under a hundred degrees celsius and fahrenheit 200 for those of you south of the border that's because we're testing the heat resistance I suppose of 3 interesting phones, we have the iphone 7 the note 7 that's right one of those rare species and we also have a google pixel I need to show you how hot this is oh brother so I'm told that the surface of this table somewhere in the neighborhood of a hundred-degree got a little thermometer down there you can see the phone these things have been sitting here cooking for about an hour [Laughing] I can't open the camera app anymore in that one, this one is trying to load with the android symbol on it and of course the iphone has the temperature warning on it like I'm in the middle of desert or something, like can't even open your eyes Those Lights I wonder if we can take them off the board and lay them flat all my hat oh my the brim of the Hat is more pliable than usual all at all all hot holi shaker table, going to shake some things around so we moved on to the next section now this room is incredible you guys know that I've been combating echoes and reverb for most of my life this thing in here with all these shapes and foam in the treatment and so on creates this audio tense environment say a few words right television microphones here the microphones here right down here on my body sounds very streamlined I was all about any kind of echo in this environment these things really need though the shapes that are in here we've got two different phones for both iphone 7 one of them is strapped into this atomic three extreme case for iphone 7 from ghost tech now take a look at that been there this entire thing is going to start shifting and shaking like an earthquake and some of the objects inside that Ben are not so friendly to phone fortunately unfortunately i don't know there's one naked iphone 7 1 strapped into this and we're going to test the difference here today both get smashed maybe it's possible does one get smashed that's probably that's likely well yeah Brian's phone but then again maybe there's some magical touch you've got 20 G's of force and ready set record and let's check them in one each was going to win oh my goodness i'm nervous about this it's a rugged world out there and it's all happening right here fired up Oh baby oh let's get it started with getting started there are white oh my it's one gotta be up look at that kind of cool-looking actually the lens kind of serve live yes haha whoa still kind of on a little bit now the one in that case they've got some marks on it yeah look wow just so you catch an idea of the amount of force this metallic frame on here got beat up also and i'm going to click the recording the case did the trick chase vs no case do you want to be how do you want to live your life also i don't recommend putting your phone in here so let's head back in here now and see what the state of those phones is currently have been completely melted or have they survived oh hello hundred and to look at this Arbor alright let's just rescue Oliver brain-o google pixel which is rebooting constantly now what about the note the iphone might be the only one that smoked the notes just looping wow these two are just looping temperature 60 exhale just loaded up it's working the note 7 doesn't have much battery on the eight percent but it's working you got to a certain point where that the battery is too hot to take a charge short is it stopped taking a charge that itself down to eight percent battery but did not explode the iphone still needs to cool down before i can use it two and a half hours under the Sun solar lights it seems maybe like the iphone took this the worst oh they're back now but the screen is messed up see that alright so maybe I take that back these buttons are not functioning anymore maybe this note is currently exploding clear winner here is the pixel screen looks just as good as it did when I put it in there it stayed on the longest by far and recovered fastest certainly if there was one of the three that you wanted to leave on a dash and a super hot day in the desert this will be the one to do it with where are we today where are we here at least one side of the University of Ontario Institute of Technology",

    "transcript": "- Hello and welcome to \"This Is\". Today we have the Stem player, by the artist formally known as Kanye West - [Austin] As of recording today, supposedly Donda 2's coming out exclusively on the Stem Player. What I do think it's really worth a conversation about is not only this cool Stem Player but also the idea of releasing music exclusively on physical hardware that's not Wu-tang. - Yeah, so let's get you up to speed on this okay. So the Stem Player is a device, it looks like a $5 Bluetooth speaker - Maybe you should try again? - It feels nice. I will say it feels nice. - You tried to say something bad and you immediately had (indistinct) - I hate the color of it. I don't like this weird skin tone color. What this is capable of doing is breaking down a song into four different tracks. And basically you can mix a song, however you want it's a choose your own adventure for music. - The other thing is you can load up pretty much any music you want via that USBC port but you do it on the website. It will then split that song up into the four stems, load it into the player but then once you have it loaded up, you can then play it. The way it works is kind of interesting. So I'm gonna fire it up. All right. So we're gonna play. (hip-hop music) So this is full volume. Everything. What I can do is I can actually adjust it so I can start isolating different stems. So this is the full mix, right? I can do like a start pulling things down. So those are drums. I can also solo the drums. Vocals exclusively. and they can also mix it, right? So if I wanna bring the vocals all the way down, - [Matt] Yeah. - It does have an aux jack. And in fact, I was actually most using this with headphones because the speaker is fine but obviously it's just a small speaker. - This is a really cool device. And I think it does a really good job at what it advertises. - Right. Like I don't think there's any type of false advertising here. - Yeah. It's not perfect, but it's not claiming to be. It's cool. However, my problem with it is that one there is no reason this has to be a $200 physical device. - [Austin] Mm. - This could 1000 billion trillion percent. - Yeah. - Be an app. - [Matt] The, the problem I have with this concept here, - [Austin] yeah. - [Matt] Is not the stem. I think the stem is actually a great idea. I would love to see more of this in, you know, on other things. - [Austin] Yeah Yeah. So this is the first that we are actually having a physical hardware pay wall when it comes to music. We've never had this before. We've had plenty of software ones. (Austin sighs) We've had like title exclusives. - Yeah We've had, we've had Spotify exclusives. - Yeah. But, apple music is on Android. It's not, you know, like you don't need an iPhone to listen to something that's on apple music. Here is the, this is the difference. - It is. So the, the pitch for this is that this is a $200 gadget. And obviously coming from Kanye, it's gonna be a specific kind of demographic. You know? I mean, this is not just a random bit of tech you're actually buying into sort of the culture behind it, there's a there's hype beasty stuff. - And if you think about this as, oh, this is how you listen to all of Kanye's music for the next five years, right. I'm not saying that that's what's gonna happen but it's an interesting thought. And it's certainly what I think he's pushing toward is trying to own his music, start to finish. - Which is what he cited. - It's an admirable idea, right? - It's - I would love to own my videos and my platform top to bottom and not have to pay YouTube and this and that and everything obviously their advantages to something like that. But for someone like Kanye, I know that I'm gonna go outta my way to listen to this on this stupid Stem player or find another way of listening to it, to whatever new album he brings out. Because I know that that is an experience I want to have. Right? There's something to this that I think is worth considering more than just, oh, it's a gimmick and it's a cash grab, cause it is both of those things but I don't think that's doing it real justice. - I agree to an extent. So he's done something like this before where he went over to Tidal and made \"The life of Pablo\" exclusive to Tidal. Maybe two months later it was available everywhere it was available. And someone actually sued him because they're like I signed up for Tidal. - [Austin] Oh yeah. - [Matt] Specifically for this. - Well But sort of, but the thing is, this was actually already on sale before the album was ever coming to it. - Right - Right? Like this is already just a product that you could buy. in fact this was actually purchased well before he announced that Donda 2 is gonna be exclusive to it, - but would we be talking about this at all? If Donda 2 wasn't exclu... like, That's what's, that's what we're talking about because of the public... - It's an interesting discussion to have - Yeah. Imagine. - Okay. - If apple came out and said the only way to get whatever like the big upcoming album is is to only have it on iPhone. - [Austin] Yeah. - Not, not apple music. It's only on an iPhone. - I agree with that in principle. However, I don't think Tim Cook is dropping a hot new beat tomorrow. (vinyl scratching) - I don't know. - This is Kanye, an artist bringing out something that he's trying to own. Like again, I don't wanna make it seem like I think this is a great idea. Cause I, I think it's a little bit weird and honestly any album that's not on Spotify, I'm pretty much not gonna listen to very often. It's just it. I don't wanna have to go and move between apps and stuff but you know, I will do is I will wanna listen to it at least once I wanna experience it at least once. And I think it's commendable in some ways for an artist to wanna own their art. Right. - I agree with that. - Supposedly this is gonna be completely outside. - [Matt] There's plenty of stuff about like how Spotify and apple music that like, you know, they don't they don't pay that great. Especially for lower, you know, smaller artists. But, again, there's no reason that this had to be hardware that you you could have done all of this with an app where someone could still have it in their pocket. - Yeah. Because Kanye is also not the first person to try this. So do you remember like in, it was like 2014 when it actually came out, it was the, pano, pano. - [Austin] Yeah the. - [Matt] Pano player. - [Austin] Was that Neil Young? - [Matt] It was Neil Young, yeah. And so he tried to do something similar, you know he said I'm gonna have my own hardware player but here's the thing, you could get the same level of quality if you had a good deck for your, you know, for your phone. - [Austin] Sure. Yeah. - [Matt] And, and it was like, it was a high budget to be carrying around a secondary device in your pocket. Do you really wanna carry that around with you? - No. No. Okay. So here's the thing, right? There's something unique about a hardware product that does things in a little bit more of a tactile way and the fact that you can get exclusive content for it means that for 98% of people out there you're probably gonna find another way to listen to this album. There are very few people gonna spend $200 just to listen to an album. Right? And I think that everyone should understand that that is the case. There is also something to be said about an artist who creates a piece of hardware that has a real purpose. That does something that I think is cool bit gimmicky, but cool. And the ability for you to own your own music top the bottom, right? Like imagine what else this could do. Imagine other albums could be exclusive to the Stem player and like this is like your hardware key to, to listen to other stuff. Like, I don't think that necessarily should be the case but I think it's an interesting idea - But here's my problem with it. - [Austin] Yeah. - Is that sets a horrible precedent. - Agreed. - Everything is a money grab for companies. I mean, they're companies, they're trying to make money. I get that. But. - That is what companies do. - Like again, what if apple or Samsung said, all right. You know, we're gonna have The Weekend's next album exclusively on - yeah, that would be bad. - An iPhone, you know, especially with this being a $200 price point, I get that it's hardware that had to be developed like - This costs like 20 bucks to make. If even. (Austin laughs) - That's kind of my point, though. - [Austin] Yeah. - It's like, you know, like there was development time. They had to charge something. They can't, you know, whatever. - Yeah. - But I'm gonna attack you for a second. - Oh my God. You're gonna start attacking me now, let's go. - I think that if you had a regular income like most human beings. - [Austin] Yes. - You would have a very different tone on this. Like you, you have the disposable income that like if you dropped 200 bucks this thing, and then it goes on Spotify next week, which is like, based on track record. Exactly. What's gonna happen - [Austin] very possible. Yeah. - Like that is detrimental to a lot of people. That is months of savings for a lot of people, to have like $200 spare income to drop on that. And like, I know the comments are gonna be like you know, oh, like if you can't afford it just don't buy it. But like, like again this is just setting the precedent that you are too poor to to listen to my music and that's, and that's like that's kind of, like. That's where I'm coming from with this, putting it behind a a rather steep pay wall like this. - [Austin] Yeah, yeah. - Is like - I agree - It's just, I can't justify it, - but Matt, I agree with you. this is divisive. Like I fully agree that this is a divisive issue. Not only the Stem player being $200, but the fact that there is now a hardware paywall, because when this first came out a few months ago, it was a neat cool little gadget. It was very hype beasty. And it was an interesting way of experiencing music. But now that it is the exclusive home of fresh Kanye West music, I think it is taken on on a very different kind of tone, pun intended. I'm just saying here, I don't love this thing. I don't love the fact that this is a precedent being set. That music is going to be paywall behind a very expensive piece of hardware, but, it is a cool gadget. It is an interesting, unique way of not only playing with music, but actually being able to experience it in a little bit of a different way. Gimmicky, gimmicky, gimmicky, I will say fully gimmicky. I don't think most artists can pull something like this off. I think... - No, no one can. - I feel like buying this - What happens when the next person tries to do something different? - Let's go buy it. And it will work. Like, who else can pull this off? Like I, I think this is a standalone thing. And I think that if you can afford to justify in your mind to buy like a pair of Yeezies or some some gaps you like, stuff or whatever then you could do the Stem player because it's part of that kind of culture. And no one else has to do it. Like, am I gonna be a little bit annoyed that I can't listen a Donda 2 two on Spotify for a solid 15 minutes until he moves it over to Spotify? Yeah, I am. But guess what? That's fine. I'm not, I'm not too stressed about it. It's an interesting idea to see what Kanye is doing with it. I hope this doesn't catch on. I hope that this is not the exclusive home of all new music, but it's, I think this is the one of the more interesting music on conversations I've had in a long time because it does kind of, it breaks the status quo in a way where not everything is on streaming. Not everything is gonna be the same way it's been for the last 10 years. There are alternate ways of experiencing music that you can't necessarily get on a streaming service. And also there's just a little bit of that retro nostalgia even though it feels weird to say of like the old iPod days you just to listen to your music, you get to adjust it and play with it exactly the way you want. And I think because of that, the Stem player it is a interesting idea. Give me a second, let me look at something. - [Stem Player] Donda, donda, donda, donda... - Let us know what you think about the Donda 2 controversy that we created in our minds. Do you think it we're worth 200 bucks? Do you not think it's worth 200 bucks? (Stem Player's sound overlapping) Let us know, like subscribe, follow us on various platforms. We'll catch you in the next one. (Austin laughs) - This is so much fun! - [Austin] Matt. - Yeah. - [Austin] What happened? - So last night, pretty much immediately after we finished recording this video kind of decided to release four tracks on Donda as they're being finished. So we are downloading to the Stem player right now, and - [Austin] Guesses who's going to jail tonight. - You with that tone.",

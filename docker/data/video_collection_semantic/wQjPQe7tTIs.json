    "transcript": "- Over $3000 I paid for this thing, you people better watch this video twice. Welcome to another episode of Linus buys stuff he doesn't even know how much it costs from China. This is the Samsung W21, the color is majestic gold, the capacity is 512 gigabytes and it is an exclusive premium edition folding phone for China only, look at this packaging, is that incredible or what? Ooh, shiny. Okay, so it's like good luck, no. - [Andy] No. - No. - [Andy] It's you have the heart of the entire world. - You have the heart of the entire world, I wasn't that far off. (all laughing) That's exit, right? - [Andy] Yes. - [Linus] Yes. Okay, I got one word. Hold on, oh that's people or person. - [Andy] No. - What? Oh, for crying out loud, look, I tried. Before we go any further though, I'm gonna break tradition and I'm going to actually consult the manufacturer's website. Okay, so basically it's just a galaxy fold but in gold, angular shining transformation, metal cutting, inheriting the vision and ingenuity of the Samsung W flagship series. Wow, my expectations are very high right now. Wonderful in the palm of your form. Life is like a wave of ups and downs and only when the peaks and valleys are tempered and improved, can they be exceptionally exciting. Wow, this phone is gonna change my (beeps) life. The mighty general gate opens W world. Damn, I mean, I was impressed by the box. I mean, I did have a lot of fun opening it but you can tolerate great friends and close friends as well as the various possibilities in the future. Me, I do tolerate my friends. I don't like them, but I tolerate them. Oh, it has dual SIM, well, that's nice. That's an improvement over the regular Galaxy Fold. Enough talk, let's take a look at this thing. Seen enough manuals in my day, all right, cool. More documentation and this is it. Hmm, that does actually look pretty darn sharp. (paper rustling) Oh wow, you can really hear the texture of the phone, just pulling the sticker off. That color is surprisingly classy, man. In the picture, it looked more like, it looked more like tacky, like a really yellowy gold. That is actually kind of classy. Here's the real question that I had after, after I tell you who the sponsor is today. Private Internet Access is a VPN that allows you to access services and websites as though you were in a different country. It encrypts all of your traffic with a safe and protected IP. And you can connect up to five devices at once with clients for Windows, Mac OS, Linux, Android, and iOS. So buy a one-year plan for 39.95 and get three months for free at the link in the video description. 24 hour VIP support? - [Man] Yeah. - [Linus] Is that right? - [Man] Yeah. - Samsung doesn't have that on the regular Fold even though it's a $2,000 phone. Whoa, wait, wait, wait, shut the front door. What is this? - [Andy] 24 hour you can call any like thing, get any pick up service for the airport. - What? - [Andy] Yeah. - With the phone? - [Andy] With the phone. - What is this? Samsung has a VIP lounge. - [Andy] Yeah. - No way. So this is like, got travel benefits that come with your, for the first year I would think or something, right? One year. - [Andy] No that's, that one year is for the, just in case you break the screen. - So you have one year screen replacement and a bunch, 24, 24 hour support. And then like travel, travel benefits, like faster security checkpoints and pick up for the airport any time. What the hell is going on? How much did I pay for this thing? I've got a super fast charger included. You got some AKG headphones included, I'm not going to bother. type C2C for charging, data transfer, whatever. Of course, what I had actually wanted to know and the reason I ordered this thing in the first place all the way from China was whether the dimensions were actually any different from the regular Z Fold 2. And there were rumors that it was taller, but it seems like that was a big load of horse plop because it is clearly exactly the same phone. And seeing them side by side, dang, I'd take the gold one, I take the shiny. Like that's so boring. - [Andy] It looks really nice. - It does look really nice. The front too, like this is too plain now. Over $3000 I paid for this thing, you people better watch this video twice. Yeah, so there's the one difference. Dual SIM versus single SIM for the original Fold and this like travel, Chinese travel edition one. I'm disappointed it didn't get micro SD, but I guess the rationale is pretty simple. If you can afford this like golden general phone, then there's only one skew, the 512 gig one, and if you've got 512 gigs you don't need no stinking micro SD card. Oh, whoa, look at this. Oh, there it is. I wonder if they've made any revisions to like the folding mechanism or anything. It's hard to tell, 'cause this one's also brand new but it does seem like it might be a bit stiffer. Yeah, feels stiffer but this one's quite used now. Just like regular Z Fold 2, the fingerprint's scanner is on the right, I actually like this, it's really fast to use. Whoa, that's pretty sick desktop wallpaper. Oh my God, it has so much junk pre-installed on it. I mean then again, it's only junk because I don't recognize it. I guess all the Google stuff that comes, okay no, it's junk. It's tick, there's TikTok on here. (all laughing) The heart of the world. - [Andy] Yeah. - Okay, well I wanna go to the heart of the world. I guess the server is pretty far away. Man I love that 120 Hertz display man. Very slow animation, I hate that. That might be something that you can reconfigure though. See that, just like a really different animation style, I don't know, that time it came down fast. Do they not have Android Auto in China or something? I kind of wanna try and daily drive this thing. There's just might be like little deal breakers like that. Let's see, oh shoot, there's still stuff that's coming up in Chinese. It's actually slightly different hardware. So that might be a problem. Well, given that, I guess it's not the best $3,000 I ever spent for a different color of a phone that I already own, and that is in perfect working condition, but definitely looks sweet. And if I needed all those, like, you know, special travel well services or whatever, then, I mean, I guess it would depend how much those services cost. Just separate from a phone. Thanks Samsung for creating this, this little curiosity and thanks to you guys for watching.

    "transcript": "[Intro] Today were going to do something a little bit different, Im going to show you the entire process start to finish of how I edit one of my YouTube videos. Now since this is the entire process the video is going to be rather long and the audio on this is just going to be live. Im not going to go back through and cut or edit anything on this video just because of the extreme length. So what youve seen so far during this process is me taking the raw clips from my camera, which is the Panasonic GH4, that I use to film most of my cell phone durability tests and my teardowns, and Im going to take those clips and drop them onto my desktop. Now I personally have two SSDs inside of my computer; those are two different hard drives. I have my operating system and my program, which is Adobe Premier CC on one and then I have all my footage and files on the other SSD so that the SSDs dont have to all be recording off of one hard drive. It distributes the load across both of them evenly. And you know, Adobes supposed to run smoother that way. Anyway, so now that I have the files transferred from my SD card to my SSD, or my hard drive, Im going to take them and just drag them and drop them into Premier. I imagine... Ive never used Final Cut Pro or any of the other professional editing softwares, so everything that I go off of today is just going to be strictly from Premier. Now all the files are dropped into Premier and I can take themand if I right click on any one of these files I can create a new sequence. This means that its going to set the format of Adobe Premier to the exact same size and frame rate as the files that I shot with my camera. Normally I shoot in 4K at 30 frames per second, so thats just going to build the sequence or format around that. One nice thing about Adobe Premier is that I can adjust any of these windows and rearrange them how I want. So Im going to take my timeline and then drop that down into the bottom right hand corner and thats where I usually keep all of my clips. Thats also, you know, where the story line is going to bein that bottom time line. So if I double click on one of these little boxes in the bottom left-hand corner, these are all the clips that I just dragged in, its going to pull one of the clips into a source window which just shows me whats inside that clip. This is like the preview window of each individual clip that I can take and choose which portions of the clip I want before it goes into my actual program window which is going to be more of the final copy. So the video that Im going to be working on today is from the LG and its a pretty easy phone to take apart, mostly held together with screws, so I figured it would be a good videoa good simple video to use as part of this instructional how I edit my videos video. Kind of like the Inception of video editing here. The mic that Im recording on is a Samsung Meteor Mic. Im going to talk about that more later in the video as I explain how I do my voiceovers. So what Im doing right now is I have my first clip in my source monitor and Im choosing which parts of that clip are important. Obviously I have about 25 minutes worth of footage with the LGG5 and most people dont want to sit down and watch a 25 minute video on how to fix it. So I take all of the important bits, which usually ends up being about 5 minutes, and condense it down into one short little video that more people are interested in watching. The most important hot keys that I use during this program are the J, K, L, i and period keysand the O key. So they are all over there on your right hand side of the keyboard. So the J is like a reverse, the K is a stop, and the L is a forward. And I use those while Im navigating in inside of the source monitor and program monitor and on the timeline so I can choose which clip. And then the i sets the in point and the o sets the outpoint and I can use the period to drop that down into my timeline. So its important to use as many hot keys as possible because that really does speed up your video editing. And Ill kind of mention a few of the other hot keys that I use as I do this video editing video. So what Im doing right now is I have a few little templates set up duringwhen I, you know, set arrows and anything into my videos cuz people dont want to watch me take out 20 different screws, they just want to see where the screws are at and if they really want to pause the video they can. Im all about, you know, streamlining everything to make everything as simple as possible on my YouTube channel. Aint nobody got time to watch super long videos. So I have this template set up for arrows. These arrows I got from a font. I think its called Wingdings 3 or Webdings 3. You can see that on the right-hand side of the screen there. If you want you can make this video full screen, it will be a lot easier to tell whats going on since, you know, theres a lot of little details going on all over the place. I had counted the screws on this phone during the teardown and Im just taking each of these little arrows and lining them up with the holes where the screws came from. And this is important obviously for the viewers in the future who are going to repair this phone. Im making this video showing how I edit my videos to kind of give back to the YouTube community. Im not, you know, super nervous about sharing all of my secrets online because, you know, I really doubt there are many people interested in making cellphone repair videos on the level that I make them, but when I look back as I started my YouTube career, videos like this helped me out a ton. I remember watching a few videos exactly like this one from Ben Brown and also from one of the editors over at Linus Tech Tips. They made the full walkthrough of how they edit their videos and I learned a ton from that. So if I can help out and give a little back to the community, you know, Im all about that. I will link both Ben Browns video and the Linus Tech Tips video that I mentioned earlier down in the video description and I will try to keep on top of the comments below this video as well, but you know, I do get a lot of comments on my channel so things are kind of falling behind at this point. Im a one man band as far as editing and comments and all of my other stuff goes so its hard to keep on top of all the little stuff. But either way, hopefully this helps. And if you have any tips for me, also leave those in the comments. I like how the comments section usually turns into like a community forum for people who are attempting the same projects. YouTube is a fantastic place for do it yourself projects. I will speed up some of the more boring parts of this video, like now that youve seen me organize quite a few arrows were going to skip onto the next part. Basically Im just, you know, using my mouse to drag these little arrows around and the font is Wingdings or the Webdings 3. Now that thats done I can drag that little title page over onto my timeline and line it up where, you know, generally where I want it to be later in the video. Right now Im just doing a really really rough edit taking the important bits that I want to use in my final video and laying them all out. I think I have about 30 minutes worth of raw footage. Im taking my mouse and just kind of scrubbing through the initial timeline right there and my source monitor because that gives me an idea of whats inside of the clip and I can just use those hot keys again, the J,K, L to play, pause and reverse or rewind. And the in and the out key, the i and the o and the period to drop it down to the timeline again. Now normally I have 4 computer monitors set up on my desk, so I have you know, the source monitor on another screen so I have more room on my main monitor for the program monitor which is kind of like the preview and the timeline. You know, things spread out is just a little more organized for me. Its how my mind works. But since Im doing this screen recording, Im taking everything and putting it in one window. Its a little bit, you know, tighter space but you can make this video a full screen if you want to see like little details and the words and everything that Im using. So once again, still taking my mouse and just grabbing that little blue icon and scrubbing through the footage to see what I have to work with. Usually I edit my videos right after I do the teardown so, you know, its fresh in my mind and I kind of have a general idea of what I want to say during the teardown video. So at this point you can see me trying to remove the back. Obviously people dont want to watch the many failed attempts at me opening a phone and usually Im one of the first people on the planet to ever open up one of these devices so theres not often that I get to watch someone else do it first. Sometimes, you know, on YouTube there is people who get to the phone before I do, especially if its one like the LGG5 and I have other phones that Im working on in the meantime, so I will use other videos to watch and get tips on how to remove them. And Ive talked to iFixit and a couple of the other guys, you know, we have a pretty tight knit community as far as cellphone repair goes, and you know, they all do the same thing. If I get a video out before iFixit, they watch mine. If they get a video out before me, I watch theirs. Its just, you know, community. Were all friends and were all trying to accomplish the same thing which is to help people repair their devices and thats how communities work. I chose the LGV20 to make this video on because its so simple and easy and you can get a basic idea of how I edit my videos. Usually the timeline is much more complex than this, especially if Im working on an iPhone or a Samsung phone which has a lot more screws and, you know, theres a whole different process using like a heat gun to separate that back glass panel from the phone. So luckily the LGV20 came out and Im able to use that phone, the simple phone, to make this video with. So for this clip I finally figured out how to remove the back and pop off these two top pieces and bottom pieces, and so I realized that thats the important part of the clip that I need in my source monitor so Ill hit the i key and the o key to do the in and the outpoints and that marks it on the source monitor timeline that you can see there. And I do the period to drop it down in my timeline. You can also take your mouse and grab, you know, see in this center part of the source monitor? You can grab just the video or just the audio from that clip and drag those and drop those down into your timeline as well. So still just watching from my source monitor, finding the important bits and were just going to do, you know, a rough cut and drop those all down into my timeline. Its a pretty monotonous process, you know, Ive made over 400 videos now on my YouTube channel so I do, you know.phones, once youve been inside one youve been inside pretty much all of them. Theyre all relatively similar; just a few minor variances here and there with each new model. Anyway, so I finished all of those clips on my first little tiny clip down there in the bottom left where I, you know, keep everything organized. Its like my little library. The camera that I used, the Panasonic GH4, only lets you record in 4 gigabyte files, so you know, a video like this where its 16 gigabytes, there are quite a few files. And plus Ill stop and start the camera a couple times during the video, you know, to answer a text or just cuz Im bored or if I need to, you know, see something up close or research something, Ill stop and have a few extra clips to work with. So when I finish one clip Ill double click on the other one which opens up it up in my source monitor and then I can do the same things: scrub with my mouse, find the important parts, and use the i, the o, the j, k, and l to navigate. You can use your mouse cuz you can see all of those keys down there at the bottom of the source monitor, you know, the stop, the play, and you can use thosethe only problem is when youre using your mouse a whole lot, youre slowing down and wasting time because, you know, transferring your hand from your mouse to your keyboard or clicking on things just, you know, takes longer and you want to streamline the edits as much as possible, especially with YouTube and youre trying to create content daily, you know, like a vlogger or any type of content like that its just the least amount of time you can spend in front of a computer the better. Honestly the editing video is the worst part of being a YouTuber. Its so time consuming and, you know, its just not the most fun. Publishing content is fun. Creating the content is fun. Editing the content is not as fun. So you can see while youre watching the source monitor sometimes Ill reach up and adjust the focus of my camera, cuz my cameras not auto focused. I want to be able to choose whats in focus at any time with my lens that Im using, its the Sigma 18-35. Ill link that down in the video description. And the GH4 has something really cool called Focus Peaking and I talk a little bit about that in my studio set up tour of 2016. I will also link that in the video description, and all of that extra, you know, footage where Im adjusting needs to be cut out. I am pretty lucky doing these cellphone repair videos, that all of my lighting remains constant and the same and so theres not a whole lot of color grading or lighting the screens that I end up doing. All of that is done in camera. I have my white balance set just with the computer inside of the camera internally. Adobe Premier does have an effects panel where you can get in and do some color correction. Ill justif my white balance seems off I can just jump into the fast color corrector, use the eye dropper and click on the background and it will automatically correct that to white. But since my camera does a pretty good job with the white balance, I dont need to use that very often. Inside of the effects panel as well, if youre doing color correction you can also brighten it, sharpen it, you know, theres anything that you can do with your Instagram you can also do with Adobe Premier; change things to black and white. Luckily with my line of work I dont need to work with that stuff too much which helps streamline the process. So the screen record that Im doing right now is on my desktop PC which is a pretty powerful machine. Ill show you the specs of that at the end as we do the render section, but my laptop, which is actually what Im doing this voiceover in this particular video on of how to edit, isnt as powerful because its a laptop and so if I need to I can jump in on the source panel and the program panel, which is the center and top right, and I can drop those resolutions down from full to half. So I can edit 4K footage on my laptop, but since my laptop screen is 1080p, it doesnt need to be displaying 4K because thats just not possible. So if I drop it down to half, it uses less of my computers resources to display the image as Im editing. So keep that in mind if your computer is not the most powerful. You can still work with powerful footage using Adobe Premier, just drop the resolution down while youre working with it and then when you render it you can render it out at full qualitynot a problem. The lower you drop your resolution the less choppy the playback will be. So now you can see I am reassembling the phone. I did a couple videos way back when I started, you know, my first 30 or 40 videos, some of them I didnt put back together again and people starting complaining about that a little bit because, you know, reassembling the phone is half the process. So I make sure to include that part of the video in all of my videos, you know, in the future because my whole premise about being a YouTuber is to make life easier for people when theyre attempting repairs of their own. Im prettyIm an environmentally friendly guy, I enjoy, you know, I enjoy not wasting things. And so when people throw away a phone that still has value or that they could have sold for money, like that kind of stresses me out a little bit inside and so its important, you know, the easier I make the repair for people, the more likely they are to do it themselves which makes the world a better place in general. Less phones end up in landfills, global warming slows down. Basically by repairing your cellphone you stop global warming. Its as simple as that. So what you saw me do right there is I took that same arrow title that I used before and I went to the top left corner of that title panel and I did a new title based off of current title which basically just duplicated those arrows so I didnt have to redo them all and I just dragged and dropped that back into my timeline with the new title. So basically I have two identical title screens and I can adjust them independently of each other without, you know, disrupting the first one. It just makes life a lot easier and its a little trick that you can use when you have titles that are similar to each other and you dont want to create the new one from scratch. You can either just use a template or you can do that button I just showed you which is create a new title based off of the current title. Each time I finish scrubbing through a clip and getting the pieces that I need I can just drop down into that bottom project window where all of my little clips are and I can just double click and start a new clip in the source window and repeat the same process over and over again until all of my clips are used up and Ive got all of the important footage that I need out of each of them. So right now it looks like I have successfully put the phone back together again and the phone is functioning, thats always a good sign. So Im going to take my screen and Im going to work on theI dont normally do this, but in this particular video I lined up the phone and the tools to make a thumb nail cuz its always hard to get an interesting thumbnail from a teardown video. Sometimes with my durability videos I can get a good thumbor like in a, you know, explosion video where I was working with airbags or something theres always a good thumbnail you can use with that. But in this thumbnail for this particular video I staged it which, you know, is obviously fine. Ill make another video about how I edit my thumbnails later, you know, making the background white and everything in Photoshop. In this particular video, Im just going to be talking about video editing. So I did take a screen shot with Adobe Premier of that tile right there, in my source monitor, and I saved that in the same folder and the same SSD that all my program files are on to kind of keep that organized. So the rough edit is now complete. I have all of the little tiny clips that I want from my footage. I have about 30 minutes worth of footage and Ive taken all the important bits out of that and stuck them into my timeline. And during this whole time, you know, during the teardown itself and this rough edit Ive had these ideas coming into my mind of what I want to say during the actual video; how I want to explain things, any stupid jokes that come to my mind. You know I dont actually wing that for the most part during my voiceover. So I have this little script that I set up. In this video, the LGV20, I didnt have a whole lot of ideas coming to me during the process so Im pretty much going to write the script from scratch as you see it right now. So Im going to re-watch the video from the beginning and just explain, you know, word for word what is going on during the video. This goes back, once again, to just making the videos as short and to the point as possible. When I first started making YouTube videos, I would go and, you know, I was preparing cellphones before I was a YouTuber and I would go and watch a YouTube video on how to repair a certain cellphone, you know, back when there was 8 screws and it was relatively simple to take apart, and these videos would be like 30 minutes long or 40 minutes long and I would have to like, you know, scroll through them and like find the most important parts and these people would be talking about their lives forever and ever and everand its like whoa dude, I dont want to see your dog, I just want to see how to repair this cellphone. So I make it a point in my videos to be as to the point and concise as possible. No one wants to hear about my life, they just want to see, you know, their phone fixed and I feel like thats pretty important for, you know, any do it yourself video. So by creating this script theres not a whole lot of, you know, ums and repeating myself over and over againkind of like what Im doing right now with this particular voiceover because I dont really have a script. Im just kind of explaining things as I go along. So I hope you have your popcorn or your cereal or whatever youre doing because, yeah.anyway, back to the important stuff. In some professions theres always like the general idea that you dont want to share your secrets with the rest of the world because, you know, it will hurt your chances of success, but really with YouTube its the exact opposite. You actually get more from the system as you share more with the system. It would always bug me when I would go to college and see, you know, Id be paying thousands and thousands of dollars to go to my college classes, I actually graduated in business, but I would go to class and my teachers would pull up a YouTube video to explain the subject that I was paying them to be teaching me. And you know, obviously the YouTube video explained it better than they could and so it was good for them to use the best resource available, but it was annoying because, you know, I can go find that video myself. Im pretty good at Googling thingsits just like why am I paying my professors thousands of dollars to be teaching something that I can learn for free on YouTube. So Im pretty stoked to be part of this super awesome free system, which is YouTube, that benefits the world on so many levels. The more I can contribute, the more I get back from it so its a win-win for everybody. Plus Ive literally talked to about a thousand people about starting their own YouTube channels and maybe like one or two have actually started one and been serious about it. Most people dont realize how much work and effort goes into making YouTube videos and how much time it takes out of their day and so theyll quit, you know, after the first couple videos. But in reality being a YouTuber is actually a pretty awesome job and you really do make time for what you want most in life. So if you want to become a YouTuber you can, you just have to spend the time and, you know, the hours to do it. And there is an incredible amount of time and hours required. Most of them are sitting here editing videos like this. So a couple more things I can mention as Im finishing up writing this script. The camera mount that I use, the tripod, I mentioned it in my 2016 setup tour video which I will link in the video description, is actually a tripod that the legs extend and theres no bracket holding the legs together, so I can make them as wide as possible. And the camera, the Panasonic GH4 that Im using, is actually attached underneath the tripod. So the legs are spread and the tripods facing straight down onto my desk. The camera is facing straight down onto my desk. The white background that you see is just a white piece of paper and its a wooden desk that Im working on so that I wont bend or flex as Im using my screwdriver or prying on the screen at all. Which, you know, was a problem I had when I was using a plastic desk in the pastyou know, one of those Wal Mart desks that you get. Those flexed and it made the video quality not as good. I also used a camera with auto focus previously, and that would get annoying for people watching the video as well where it would be constantly going in and out of focus. Basically I dont improve my video quality until I start getting complaints about different things and Ill mention that as I go along. I didnt go to school for video editing or anything. All of this stuff I learned on my own or by watching YouTube videos, you know, like Ben Browns or the Linus Tech Tips or any of Adobes free videos that they have online as well. Basically if you have any question about anything and you know how to word it, you can find the answer to it. A lot of learning how to do video editing is learning the vernacular, you know, which words like what scrubbing meanswhat editingall of the terminology used for editing. So Ill try to use those same words as I do this video. So now that Ive completely watched the video and Ive written the script for the entire video, Im going to go through and just read it one more time. Obviously speed is an issue when trying to get these videos up. I dont want to spend too much time, you know, reworking something over and over and over again. Its better to get content out thats slightly imperfect than spend an extraordinary amount of hours trying to make it perfect. Time is money and you dont want to fret over the little tiny things. Plus my voice over isnt going to be perfect at the end anyway. The script is more of just a general idea of what Im going to say. Its also important for the closed captions because part of Googles system, you know, how it scans your videos, obviously the Google algorithm has no idea what is inside a video so its really really important that you try to do closed captions whenever possible. Not only does it help the people who cant hear, they can read your video, but it also helps Googles algorithm so it knows whats inside of the video and it can rank it accordingly. So if you want your videos to rank higher, do the cc-ing or the closed captions for your video. Some of my videos are shot live so I dont have a script written up for it, not my teardowns or my durability tests, but like other videos like when I worked with BriansMobile1, the guy who got me started with YouTube four years ago and we exploded some airbags, that video was shot live. So in that case, when I dont have a script, Ill have my older sister transcribe the video for me after its done. And so shes actually transcribing this video because I dont have a script for this one either and I apologize profusely for it being so long and boring, but huge shout out to her, even though she doesnt repair cellphones, she is fantastic at transcribing and I appreciate it because it helps people who cant hear, like I mentioned before, and it helps the video rank higher because Google actually knows whats inside of it due to those subtitles. So now that I have proofread my script and made any slight adjustments that I want, Im going to jump into the actual voiceover itself. Now the mic that I use is called a Samsung Meteor Mic and I will link that down in the video description. This is the same mic that I use to record the voiceover on the LGG5 video as well as the sound that youre hearing right now on this how to edit video. I usually have four monitors spread out in front of me. So I have the script on one monitor, Ill have the source monitor on a different screen and Ill have, you know, my main video editing on a third screen, and then Ill have like a research screen on my fourth monitor. So I have everything, you know, spread out in front of me does help considerably, but as you can see, it all still works just fine on one screen, its just more consolidated. So you dont need a huge studio to get started. When I started my YouTube channel I was recording everything with a cellphone which is like the old Evo 4G way back in the day that only recorded at 720. And then I was editing on a laptop. So my first 50 videos or so are shot with a cell phone and edited with a lap top. And even now, you know, I have a nicer laptop but still some of my videos are shot with a cell phone. I see so many YouTubers who are like, oh I need this nice camera before I can get started, or I need a really nice computer before I get started, and like those are the dreams. You know, obviously everyone who wants to start a business wants these nice things in order to run their business. But these nice things are not a prerequisite to running your business. You need content before you need things to run a YouTube channel. You should start your YouTube channel with what you have and then let your YouTube channel pay for the nicer equipment once youve proved that you have content worth watching. Then you can spend it on the extra toys. Okay, so jumping into the voiceover itself. Im going to mute that first track just by hitting the little m button and then Im going to hit the microphone button which will start the recording. Now I usually have this script on a different screen but for the purposes of this video so you can see everything, Im going to drop it down in front of the program monitor and the Adobe program so you can see whats going on. So Im reading through the script right now just word for word and then adding anything, you know, that I come up with off the top of my head as Im reading it. Its not super important to line this up with the video just yet. Ill be doing that all with the editing process after the recording is done. While recording all of this there is going to be quite a few mistakes but I can always edit those out later on when I streamline the video and drop it down. You can see that the video currently is about five and a half minutes and Im going to shorten it down quite a bit after I get my voice over finished. One thing that I like to do is I dont want to destroy any of the original footage so you see that the original footage has, you know, its video timeline and it has its audio timeline. Im leaving that audio timeline there just in case I want to use any of the screw driver sounds or the unclipping sounds, or any of the sounds of the phone breaking during my durability test. So I leave that intact and I make sure to do the voiceover, you know, the recording in that second audio stream so that the original audio doesnt get damaged. Its always nice to keep the original. Never destroy something that you might need later, especially since its so easy to keep in intact the first time around. Okay so you can see that the voiceover is now done. You can see all the little audio peaks and the spaces between the audios where Ive taken a breath or Ive paused for a second during the voiceover, and Im going to edit all of these out to streamline things. So Im just going to doIm going to press the c button which pulls out my razor tool and I can just clip the audio wherever I want to and then drag and drop it to delete segments. As I jump inso for this video I am going to use my original audio. So Im going to jump into the audio track mixer and go to my first track and drop that down a few decibels, usually about 4 to 6 depending on the video. That way the video from my camera, the Panasonic GH4 is going to be less prominent than the audio from my Samsung, the voiceover mic. So people can still hear the sound of the screwdriver and the phone moving around, but my voiceover will be way more prominent. So Im still using the c button, which is the cut or the razor tool and Im using that to cut out all of these extra spaces. Remember YouTube has a very very short attention span, usually about 3 to 5 minutes for my type of video. So Im going to cut out all of the extra junk so they dont have to sit through that. Watch time is also very important for YouTubes algorithm lately, so if a person is watching my video and they only watch 20 percent of it, YouTube is going to think that my video is not very important. So if I make my videos short and consolidated and important to watch the whole thing, people end up watching 60 or 70 percent. And a good watch time is obviously greater than 50. So the more I can get people watching my video the better. Thats why I only leave in the important things. During the rough edit I took out all the parts that I thought I might need for the final edit and now that were doing the final edit since the voice overs done, I can shorten the video down quite a bit. So this is the into section of my video. Im going to shorten it to the clips that I want, just right clicking and clearing. You can also use the delete key to delete anything you want. Now this is the intro. Im going to do video specifically on intros here in the next week or so on how I make a video intro like this and you can too for your YouTube videos in the future. This ones at 1080p so Im going to right click and scale to frame so it fills up the entire 4k sequence that I set at the beginning of this video. Now if I hit alt I can drag the video side of the clip down and leave the audio intact because the audio actually goes longer than what I want the video to bethe little bit of black screen that I got rid of there. Im also going to drop down the audio of that intro because some people were complaining that it was too loud. Drop it down 4 decibels or so. And you can do that on the actual audio clip itself just by dragging down, or on the left side in the effects panel as well, you can drag that. And Ill show you how to do that in a minute. So now this part of it is going to be a lot of re-watching the clips that Im editing just to make sure that things flow smoothly and I have the clips in place that I want. Im going to be scrolling in and out of the timeline with my scroll wheel, but you can also use the + and buttons up on the top of your keyboard above the letters. This is different than the numb pad; those keys, the plus and minus, dont work. You have to use the plus and minus above the keyboard itself. Also during this voiceover you can hear the sound my lips make when I talk. I had someone complain about that as well and so I usually clip those out, you know, during sentences. You know, it happens to every YouTuber duringyou know, when youre recording on a mic. Even on the super nice mics. Im using a relatively nice mic. I believe it cost like 60, 50? I dont know. It cost like 60 bucks maybe. So you know, its not a thousand dollar mic, but you know it sounds pretty good. Even the thousand dollar mics dont cut out all of the unwanted sounds. You can see the little peak right there so Im just going to drag the clip over and hide that peak and hide the breath that I took right there as well. People lose interest when you take breaths so Im going to get rid of all of the unnecessary ones. And these parts are ones where I stutter or said something wrong, or didnt like the tone of my voice when I said it. So I just re-said it and then I can click and drag and just erase the clip that I messed up on. If youve ever wondered why YouTubers always say, you know, leave a comment or like and subscribe, all of that stuff, its because viewers dont remember to do those things. So right now Im explaining that they can find the tool kits in the video description. Cuz in the video description, you know, theres a lot of ways YouTubers make money, you know, whether its through affiliate marketing or selling their own products. I send people to the description so they can find the products that Im using in my videos. And at the end of the video Ill always tell them to like and subscribe, or Ill mention it throughout the video so they dont forget. You know, even me, Im a professional YouTuber and I dont like the videos that I enjoy on YouTube unless I get reminded sometimes. So its always good practice to slip it in there. Not excessively, but when it makes sense. So to streamline this video, a lot of the times Ill just cut the clips like I used with that c button. I can also right click and adjust the speed of the clip. So right click: speed duration. Sometimes Ill do 150 percent, sometimes 200 percent. Rarely will I go up above that because it starts to get choppy with the footage, and so, you know, 150 to 200 percent is about as fast as, you know, looks good on my computer screen and in my opinion. You can also right click in-between clips and do a ripple delete which just gets rid of the blank space between clips. And also on the timeline I have that little snap icon clicked which means that as Im drag and dropping these clips it will automatically snap to the clip thats closest to it so it wont, you know, overwrite it or leave a little bit of black space or blank space in-between them. Its always annoying when you render your final clip and you find like 2 seconds of blank space in-between two clips and you have to go redo the whole thing because the snap wasnt enabled and the clips werent butted right up next to each other. So there are two ways of listening. I can just hit that play button and play it and listen to it naturally or I can speed it up with the l button, the more I press the l button the faster it will play forward. The more I press the j button, the faster it will play backward. Or I can also just click that little blue icon and drag it. Its called scrubbing through the timeline and I can listen to it. Theres a ton of preferences and stuff you can set up and stuff like if you go to edit it in preferences. You can get rid of the sound that it makes while youre scrubbing, but I actually really enjoy that. I can hear it very quickly and get all the information that I need. Its also very important to brand your videos. At the end of this video I will show that I drop a watermark into the bottom left corner of JerryRigEverything. Its weird but I have a lot of people stealing my teardown videos. Now Im not sure why someone would want to steal a very boring teardown technical video like this but it happens a lot. And so with that watermark its very easy for people to notice that its my video and come and tell me because I dont always see them first. I usually have, you know, someone shout out to me on Twitter or send me an email saying hey, you know someone stole your video. And YouTube is incredibly good about giving credit to the person who posted the video first. So Ill get in there and file a copyright claim and its usually taken down within one or two hours. Not a big deal at all. The filing the copyright claim only takes a couple minutes, you know, probably 3 minutes. You just have to link the offending video and your own video and you can even file multiple complaints in the same complaint form. So huge shout out to YouTube for making that an easy process for creators like myself. I really appreciate that. So theres probably a hot key for changing the speed durationI dont use it, I just find right clicking and then going up to the speed duration is, you know, fast enough for me. In the speed duration box theres also a clip that if youre changing the speed of multiple clips it will automatically shrink them altogether, not leaving that black space in-between them all. So you just have to find what works best for you and your work flow whether you use a ton of hot keys or if a mouse works just kind of like how Im doing it on my computer. Like I mentioned before, I didnt go to school for any of this stuff. This is all stuff Ive learned, you know, from trial and error or from YouTube, or Adobes free videos on how to, you know, create content. You can really learn anything you want on YouTube. Its pretty incredible. So for this clip I did throw in a political Donald Trump joke which, you know, happens every now and then. Donald Trump is an easy guy to make fun of and so I just grabbed a little PNG file off of a Google image search, and then I can drop that down into my playlist just like you would with a title. Take that title image and drag and drop it down into my timeline. Theres a whole huge controversy over like the fair use and stuff like that. I havent had any problems with using still images like that. I just make sure that if there is a watermark or branding on the picture I leave that intact when I post it into my video. Or if, you know, the website has specifically stated that they want credit for their picture or if they dont want you to use their picture at all obviously respect that. But as long as youre not claiming someones creation as your own, fair use usually is pretty fair. So Im still using my mouse wheel a ton while Im editing this timeline. Ill hold down the alt key and scroll in with my mouse and scroll out with my mouse to focus on these little tiny intricate details that Im adjusting. When I drag and drop that timeline to eliminate a breath, Im usually just eliminating like a split second or two. Now these dont seem important if Im just talking about them, but in a video where a YouTubers attention span is so short, these are very very important. And thats why youll see some of the most popular YouTubers doing these jump cuts to where they cut out all of their breaths to keep peoples attention longer. One of the best ways to learn how to YouTube is to just, you know, copy the guys who are on top. Not copy them as in their channel and their videos word for word, but their stylelike their editing. You know, figure out how they do their cuts and their zooms and, you know, all of these different little tiny things that most people wouldnt notice unless youre in the actual business. And Ill explain some of that as we go along. So you can see that Im using my mouse to start and stop the timeline a lot and Im dragging it all along the screen. And this is actually probably pretty bad practice. You know, its slowing me down the more I use my mouse. If I was able to use more keyboard shortcuts it would speed things up considerably. Now if you jump it up into the edit, you can scroll all the way down and see the list of shortcuts that Adobe has and I would recommend learning those as youre beginning and using them because it will speed you up later on. I wish I used more keyboard shortcuts and Ill probably try to focus on using them more in the future, but this video right here is just showing how I, you know, edit now. I could technically be using the spacebar button to start and stop the video as its playing. I think its because Im, you know, just using my mouse to drag and drop so many clips, my mouse is already, you know, in motion. So I use that to start and stop them as well as Im dragging and cutting things all over the place. The way I got my timeline to look the way it isyou see the audio graphs and you can see the peaks and the low pointsI just hovered my mouse over that left side and used my scroll wheel to expand that particular section of the timeline, whether its the audio or the video. If you expand it you can see more detail and this helps a lot when Im using that audio timeline to splice different mistakes that Ive made together. Like lets say I start saying a sentence and I stop halfway through and repeat that same sentence over againI can take the correct part of that and splice in the corrected part of that into the correct part. And it makes it easier when I can see the actual timeline and what the features look like in the audio visually. So earlier in the video I created that second title by using the same title as the first one and just kind of duplicated it and it allowed me to create a second image of it. So I can edit the second one and it wont change anything on the first title and that will allow me to get the screw locations matched up to where it was as I reassemble the phone since its not going to be the exact same position as it was when I took the phone apart. So I need the arrows to be in a different spot. Anyway, so Im dragging that second title into place during this second rough edit of the footage. I usually do the first edit which you saw, where I get all the important bits out. The second edit which I goI match it to the voice over. Then the third edit is when I do like my zoom-ins and crops and, you know, make sure everything is streamlined and I didnt miss anything. And then Ill usually watch it through a couple more times just to make sure that there are no mistakes and then render it. And Ill walk you through all of that stuff right now. And as you can see, you know, I make a lot of mistakes when I do my first voiceover for my video, whether I dont like my intonation as Im recording or if theres just different mistakes, different mispronunciations. Theres a lot of editing that goes into the voice over itself. And you know, that adds a lot of time to the actual video editing process. If I was able to just record it live and post the video, it would take a lot less time than it does. But, one of the reasons that I am the most watched and viewed cell phone repair channel on the internet is because I can take a lot of information and consolidate it into a couple minutes. So these extra couple hours that I spend editing my videos, you know, they pay off in the long run. So for this final clip of the voiceover, I noticed this myself as I was watching it on my phone one time, is that if I just stop the audio it will make kind of like a popping noise and if it doesnt fade off its abrupt and people notice it. So I can set a key frame right after the audio stops and then I can drop the audio down gradually with a second key frame at the end of the clip. And you can set the key frames as you saw in my video just by clicking the little icon and then moving the timeline a little bit farther on and then setting the second key frame and thats how you do it there. What Im doing right now is Im setting the end card screen. So the end card is something that YouTube has recently started and it only goes for the last 20 seconds of the video. So Im going to make my end card screen just those last 20 seconds. I added the its free part because a lot of people on YouTube dont know that subscribing to a channel is free, especially someone who is only coming to YouTube to learn how to fix their phone. They are obviously not on YouTube a whole lotyou know not usually, sometimes they are, but theyll think that oh if I hit that subscribe button its going to charge me like a monthly fee or whatever. Ive found that I did get a large increase in subscribers once I started mentioning in the video that it doesnt cost anything to subscribe. So thats why I do that. And then I also do the shout out, you know, with the Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter. If I didnt mention, you know, hey follow me I wouldnt have any followers over there on Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter cuz people just, you know, dont do anything or realize that you want it unless you tell them specifically that you want it. Communication is really important. I find that my subscribers and my followers are directly related to how many times I tell them to follow me and subscribe so it is important. Now I did have a screen preset a template preset- for that title. This is my watermark in the corner. You can set the capacity of this watermark to whatever you want. Since my screen is white and my watermark is white and there is no border around the text, I leave my capacity at 100 percent because it just blends right into the white background anyway, its not that obstructive and its not too large, but it is definitely there so people can find my video if its ever stolen and come and tell me about it which I super super appreciate. So I locked that top baryou can see the video timeline up thereso I locked that so I can click and adjust anything below that because if I click on the program monitor its going to only select the one screen thats on the top the top layer of it which is the watermark. So you know Im mostly going to be adjusting the video and I dont want to touch the watermark, so since its locked I can accomplish that. So in this particular run-through the video Im going to adjust the volume. So right there there was something in my main audio footage from my Panasonic GH4 that I didnt want, so I just clipped it and then dropped the audio down all the way so its out and people cant hear it anymore. Im also going to be going through this footage and zooming in on things that I want to focus on or draw attention to or show. One thing I learned from the behind the scenes channel of Devin Supertramp is that you want to show something in a way that people havent seen before that makes it interesting to them. Thats what keeps people around. And so I will zoom in on things because normally people dont see things that close up as they would with a 4K camera. Also you see right here that Im doing just a super super quick zoom-in on something. And youll notice that a lot of huge YouTubers do this as well when they want to emphasize something that theyre saying, theyll crop in on themselves just ever so slightly. So Ill click on the frame and then go over to my left side on the master panel there where its adjusting the clip, and I can adjust the scale. So if Im doing just the general zoom-in Ill usually jump in, you know, like to 125 or so. But if Im going to do a massive zoom-in on something I need to show, specifically for a repair, I can go all the way to 300 or 400 percent since Im working with 4K footage here. Zooming in super far with 4K footage you dont lose very much image quality which is awesome and one of the main reasons why I have a 4K camera in the first place is purely for that zoom feature. Most people dont have 4K monitors to watch things on, but anyone can appreciate a good zoom. So after I zoom in I can double click on the monitor and since I have that top watermark locked its not going to move and I can move just the screen underneath it, or the layer underneath it is better said. Still using my alt button and my mouse to scroll in to the timeline so I can see those little intricate details and the timeline sound that Im zooming in on. Looks like my joke is placed correctly. Scrub through it just a couple more times to make sure. A lot of planning goes into these jokes. So I zoomed in about 300 percent on that one and the image quality is still pretty darn good. A lot of these second, third and fourth run-throughs is just a lot of watching to make sure that the timing is correct between the voiceover that I did and the original footagecuz you know, thats what video editing is. If you want to move the effects from one clip to another, like lets say Ive cut a clip and Ive zoomed in on half of the clip but I want to zoom in and arrange the other half of the clip the same way, but I left the cut there in the centeryou can just copy the attributes and then paste the attributes to the other one or any of the other clips on the timeline that you need to. So right clickcopythen right click paste attributes. And that will, you know, change the speed of the clip as well as, you know, the crop of the clip, the zoom of the clip. Any of the attributes that you have changed on the first one will then copy over to the rest of the clips. Thats a good way to not have to change each clip individually. Now Im going into that second title screen where I, you know, just duplicated the first arrow screen and Im making sure all these arrows are lined up. Back to the keeping people interested in your video, you know, using those subtle props youll find that a lot of big YouTubers use it too when theyre making a joke or when they want to emphasize something. I noticed MKBHD usually does it a couple times during his videos. Its super super subtle so you wont notice it unless you are actually paying attention to it, but as you watch his videos watch for that. It will be showing him just talking and then it will zoom in for just a couple seconds and then zoom back out just, you know, a quarter of an inch or so, but it will happen and that keeps you interested subconsciously. So we are reaching the end of my video. You can see the end card up there with the Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter icons. Those are all PNG files which means they have a clear background which is nice. Also side note, if you use that Snapchat icon on your Snapchat it will actually direct you straight to my Snapchat so its specifically designed for my Snapchat. So now that Ive done the third walkthrough, which is just kind of, you know, taking all of the little different clips and setting those, you know, doing the zooms and making sure that it all flows smoothly. Ill usually watch it, you know, a couple more times just to make sure that theres no other mistakes or errors and everything is the way that I want it to be. And then I can move into the actual exporting of the file and uploading it to YouTubewhich is a whole new ball game all by itself. It is always a good idea to save your project a ton of times as youre, you know, working on it. Also set your auto saves to, you know, every 15 or 20 minutes just in case something bad happens to you during your project. Okay so what Im going to do is Im going to export this right now. Im going to click on the little file name right there, the little part in blue, and then I can save it as whatever I want to. This is how you get your video, you know, stitched together into a viewable format for YouTube. So Im just going to name it the LGGV 20 Teardown. Oh, I think I called this the LGG5 a couple of times during this videooh well. LGV20 is what I meant to say. And so Im going to save it as that and then as far as the export settings go Im going to do the H264 which is what YouTube prefers. And this match source high bit rate crap is a big mistake on Adobes part because this high bit rate is only rendering it at 10 megabits per second which is completely way too low for what YouTube uses. So Im going to take this and adjust it up because my cameras shooting at 4K 100 megabits per second, and this is just something I pulled off of Googles website talking about what bit rate your footage should be as you upload it. So if youre doing 1080p you should get 8 megabits a second, or 12 if youre using those higher frame rates. And if youre doing 4K theres no way you should ever upload something at 10 megabits per second. You need it to beyou know, I....the minimum I would ever do is 50, but since my cameras doing 100, you know, I might as well render it at that. The way that the H264 is like encoded though, it will end up being about 80 megabits per second and thats just how H264 converts the image into H264. And Ill probably make a video about that in the future, but it is very important. So rendering at maximum depth is talking about the color, whether its 8 bit or 10 bit. Most monitors can only do 8 bit so you dont need to worry about doing the 10 bit or rendering at maximum depth. And then the maximum quality or maximum render quality is talking about blending frames together. And thats important if youre doing a lot of special effects, but since I dont do a lot of special effects Im going to leave that unchecked. So yeah, I think that hits all of the exporting settings. When II learned about bit rate and stuff when I was doing my Nexus 6P video and a lot of people were complaining that they couldnt see the Nexus 6P logo on the back of the phone when they were watching at 720p or lower and thats because of YouTubes compression. Since I uploaded that at 10 megabits per second, that particular camera was using whats 50 megabits a second, I was losing out on a bunch of that quality and YouTube was just crushing the video at 10 megabits per second and people werent able to see the detail anymore unless they were watching at 1080p, which is extremely frustrating. So from then on I made sure to use the higher bit rate on every single one of my videos. And so if you want your videos to look crisp or clear, use the higher bit rate when exporting at H264. So my computer at home is a beast; this desk top. Because Im rendering at the higher bit rate its using less of my CPU during the render. If I was using a low bit rate, my computer CPU would be thinking a lot more about the transcoding process. Im not sure why it does this. This is something that Adobe, you know, had their own issues with, but you know, its still pretty fast. And I usually use the Adobe media encoder instead of using Adobe Premier to encode it and that just frees up the Adobe Premier so I can use that when Im setting up my thumbnail. I can do my screen shots and everything. Devin Supertramp has some good behind the scenes stuff, and the Linus Tech Tips video that I mentioned earlier also is fantastic, as well as Ben Brown has a How I Edit My Videos. Im going to link all of those at the end of this video and, you know, if you have any tips for me, also leave those in the comments, you know, that will help out other people as well, not only myself. And YouTube is an awesome platform for sharing tips and tricks and thats the way, you know, education is going. You can learn everything you could possibly want to for free online. And thats the way it should be. So hopefully you enjoyed this. Thanks a ton for watching and I will see you around.",

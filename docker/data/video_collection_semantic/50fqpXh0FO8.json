    "transcript": "(upbeat music) - Hey guys, it's Justine and guess what we have here. If you guessed AirPods Generation Three, you would be correct. I am so excited about these because I absolutely love the shape of the AirPods Pro, but I loved the fit of the original AirPods. So the original design of the AirPods is actually taken from the wired earbuds, which I'm sure many of you guys might remember, but this is kind of big news because apple actually did change the design slightly for the new ones. So let's unbox them and check 'em out. Um, can we get a drum roll please? (hands hitting table imitating drum roll) Okay. We still have one more thing. (gasps) Oh, whoa, oh, this is interesting. I thought this was going to be the exact same size as the AirPods Pro case. And it looks like it's a little smaller. Oh, it is. Look at this. (gasps) Whoa. So this is the new Gen Three and this is the AirPods Pro. From the top, it kind of looks very similar. Anything else? Oh yes, we have a cable. Thank you. And it's USB-C. Nice. Still lightning, but the other end is USB-C. (upbeat music) Let's take a look at these new AirPods. (gasps) It's so much smaller. Like, look at that little stem. It's just about the same size, I think, as the AirPods Pro. So let's line them up and just really take a peak. So, Gen Three, AirPod Pro, and the previous old school AirPod. Look at that, that's a long stick. The real test though, is what's it gonna fit like? I got a little left and a little right, And in... oh. They feel a little bit bigger than the old versions, which, for my little ears... Okay, I thought it was going to be a problem. But the only thing that happened was I got dizzy from shaking my head too much. They do have a little bit more of a, like, a larger fit and feel. It's actually a lot larger. Interesting. So here's what they look like. Okay. Here's the smile test. I'm smiling and they're not falling out. This is all really good news. One of the things that I love so much about the AirPods and HomePods, and basically everything that Apple has, you just have to bring it to your phone and it's like, \"Hey, do you want to set up this thing?\" Yeah, I do. How did you know? And the new AirPods are no exception. Media control, press once on either AirPod to play, twice to skip forward, three times to skip backwards. Look at this little tutorial! Yeah, we'll do some announcing. Oh, it looks like my case needs charged. So I guess I'll charge the case. The one thing that is great about these is the increased battery life, but how do they sound? All right. They are in my years, they have connected. Hits in spatial audio. Okay. We definitely need to listen in spatial audio. Let's listen to a little Ed Sheeran. (gasps) Oh, God, it scared me! Oh-- Okay. Spatial freaking audio. It's working, no way! Okay, all right. I need to turn this down. This sound quality, I'm freaking blown away. The-- like, especially with the spatial audio, like there's absolutely no comparison to the previous version like that-- this is unbelievable. I wish you guys could hear this right now. This is not me being, like, overdramatic iJustine, like, this is actually genuinely freaking awesome. I am so shook. Like, the sound of the AirPods Pro is so good. This is definitely on par with it. You just, aren't going to be getting the noise cancellation features or the transparency. But this sounds amazing. So I think the real test is I'm going to actually have to use these. Like I can't just be like, \"Cool. I'm here at my desk. I listened to one single song.\" I need to actually take these somewhere. I need to go out. I need to run. I need to do my daily activities. I need to edit on these and really see what they're like. And maybe I'll even take these on a little trip, test them out on an airplane. Specifically, just for this video. Like, I'm oh, I'm going to hop on a flight just because I need to test these. I really-- It's not like I had a trip planned anyway ahead of time, I promise, I swear. (upbeat music) So the new AirPods are actually pretty awesome. I have a weirdly shaped ear that a lot of headphones do not work, especially earbuds. So they did change the shape. They are slightly larger, so they don't fit as well for me. But the sound quality of these is so, just absolutely mind blowing with the spatial audio that I really can't get over it. I've been editing with them on the new Macbook, I've been using it to go for some runs. I did actually travel this past weekend, I did a quick day trip to Napa and it was so awesome being able to actually listen to these and use them on the flight. So I did get to test these out in all of the scenarios that I normally would be using my AirPods and they worked great. They still fit. I do like that the stems are shorter. I love that these do have the force touch, so I'm able to control the audio. If you guys have never experienced the spatial audio, because they are only in the Pro version, it's gonna blow your mind. I can't wait for you guys to experience it. I also posted my Macbook review with the new 16 inch MacBook. So if you guys want to check that out, I will put an end card here, link, so you can check that out. I'll also put a link in the description. And if you guys haven't already, be sure to subscribe, like this video, hit the bell so you'll be notified when I post new videos and I'll see you guys in the next one. (upbeat music)",

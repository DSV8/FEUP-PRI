    "transcript": "- [Framework Team] Hi Linus! - Somehow word got out to the Framework team that I was heading to Cooler Master to cover the case that they built in collaboration with Framework. So imagine their disappointment when they all showed up and found out Cooler Master wasn't demoing it. Fortunately, Framework CEO extraordinaire Nirav showed up with a care package that has both the Cooler Master case and the reason that I need it. You see, I am going to be the first person outside of Framework to upgrade my original Framework laptop, which started its life as an 11th gen Intel machine to Ryzen 7000 mobile. All I need now is somewhere to perform the surgery. Oh, and this segue to our sponsor. - NexiGo, whether you're in need of webcams or accessories for your VR device, NexiGo has a great selection of products to choose from. Learn more about 'em at the link below. - I have to know for the team at Framework, how painful was it watching me last time screw up like half of this upgrade process. - [Nirav] That hurt to watch. - You do understand I've still looked at none of the documentation, right? - I fully expect that you've never read documentation in your life. - But hey, now that's not fair. But you are here to make sure nothing goes wrong, right? - Yes, definitely. First, you need a screwdriver. - Oh, I got you. (case flops) There. - Never leave home without one. - Yeah, absolutely, I mean, did you see me taking apart the new Nvidia Grace super chip- - Oh my God. - Server with this thing? Oh boy. Don't judge me. Look, from a waste standpoint. - That's true, yeah. - I should keep using this dented chassis. - And until it melts, or. - Exactly. - Disintegrates somehow. - That's what I'm talking about. And the fact that I can keep using it with modern hardware, that's the whole point. - It is, and if you build a LTT hammer, you can bang the dent back out. - We may actually do that. For the uninitiated, this is one of the coolest things about the Framework laptop, the modular IO. You can have USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, you can have four HDMIs on your laptop if you really wanted to. I don't think you could drive them all at the same time, but. - You can drive three of 'em. Actually, you can drive all four if you're not using the internal display, on Intel. - Okay, all right, fair enough. He's just gonna correct everything I say. - Every sentence is gonna have a correction. - It's good because the audience likes seeing me taken down a peg. - Nope, nope, nope. - I mean, no, okay, hold on, hold on, hold on. - Yes, good. - In fairness to me, it's been a while since I've done this. - Wait, wait. You have to shut, power it off first. - Why? - Well, technically I guess you could leave it on, but it's bad for your OS. - Permission. - No, come. - Hold on, I'm not gonna break the ribbon cable. I remember the ribbon cable. - Good, okay. - How cool is it that this is magnetic though, okay? - [Nirav] It's like a fidget toy. - I mean, you heard it from the CEO first. This is a fidget toy. How much are you guys enjoying watching me bug him? - Our head of ideas looking at this, thinking like, oh my God, what's happening to this laptop? - So that goes up a little something like that. And then there's a little pull tab here, boop. Now my keyboard and track pad, both of which are user serviceable, are removed. Well, let's just start removing things. The SSD's gotta come out. Now I'm gonna remove the Wi-Fi card. - Yes. - Let's put that with that. (laughs) - Those are actually the same, so that's okay. - They're color coded, right? - Yes. - Yes. Isn't that cool? Oh yeah, and there's extras. Just in case you are me, and you lose some. Huh, I didn't tell you this, but aside from wanting to upgrade, I've had an issue with my display. Every once in a while it just like, (mimic crushing sound) you know, does stuff. So I figure I probably screwed up something here. - You might have. - Did I pinch it? - By scratching around like that. Possibly, it's a graphics driver issue and you need to update your drivers, that's one possibility. - Okay, well, one way or another, we're gonna disconnect this. - [Nirav] Yes, if you are not careful with the eDP cable, you might have messed up somewhere, something in there. - Cool, now I'm gonna pull out this daughter board thing. - Yes. - Just, just, just, just relax, I'm gonna release the latch, sort of. - Actually you wanna disconnect it from the other side. Okay, that also happened, it came off. (laughs) It'll probably go back on. - [Linus] Oh oh oh speakers. - Yes, and you've got two more cables? - No, no no, don't, don't. - Okay. - Don't tell me the answers. - I won't spoil it. - Don't tell me the answers. Okay, we've got the, whatever the crap this is. - Yeah, you should use a- - JCAM, oh. - Plastic spudger, not a metal screwdriver for that. - You say there's another one. Well, I wouldn't have... - Most important one. - I wouldn't have noticed that, so, oh God. The battery's still connected. - Yes. - Well, there's your problem. You should have done that one first, realistically. - Oh, it's actually safe to disconnect the other cables while the battery's still plugged in as long as the LEDs aren't blinking. - Oh, okay, what? Why do the LEDs matter? - So the LEDs are indicating that the main board is still powered. And we've designed this in a way that if the system's open like that and powered off, it'll shut itself off after about five or 10 seconds. And then you can do anything safely. - So it's like chassis intrusion, but in a way that's not (beep). - Yeah, that's helpful. - And then the best way to remove the main board is to just flip it upside. - Oh my god. Okay, that'll work, don't do that, anyone please. - Strictly speaking, there's nothing else I need to do. - No, that's it. - But I do wanna investigate my eDP cable. So we're gonna pull off my bezel. - Yeah, you should open that further. It's easier to take the bezel off. - Oh, got the tech tips here. - Yeah, Framework Tech Tips. - Okay, so what did I do? I think I routed this wrong. - Yeah, you have to be careful. There's a routing channel here and you wanna route it through there and you have to carefully route it around the hinge in a way where it doesn't get pinched. - Yeah, not bad, you've built a laptop before. - Built a few thousand of them, I'm sure. - We gotta make a big decision. Do we wanna put the AMD board in now or do we wanna put this in the Cooler Master case. Cooler Master's been generous enough to lend us their booth. Why don't we put it in the case? Can I call on the case PM to come help me with that? - Esther, do you want to go in the video, do the case? It's okay, they'll give you direction for what to do. - Okay. He told me I don't need to speak. (laughs) - Oh, that was a lie. Why would we put a microphone on you if you don't have to speak? Who designed the case then? Cooler Master or Framework. - [Esther] We design together. - Oh really, okay. - It's a very useful case, so if you got our laptop and you need to replace the motherboard and then you got the older one, so you can place this on this magic box. - [Linus] Okay, now hold on a second, what's that? - [Esther] A rubber stand with VESA mount screws on here. - [Linus] Oh. - [Esther] On the bottom side. - So you can mount it on the desk or use the screws that are in here, and then what? Put them in the keyholes and mount to the back of a monitor anywhere you want. - Yes. - Now tell me something. The laptop itself only has an intake on the bottom, but the case has an intake on the back and the front. Why's that? - So we try to make the intake more so you can release more heat. - Oh, so it's just to improve cooling. - Yeah. - Now your job is very simple. If I do anything wrong, you have to stop me. - Okay. - Do you think you can do that? - I can do that. - Okay, perfect. Whose idea was it to do a clear front? - We kind to put our product line to be transparent to see the re-use modules. - Cool, oh, and it's got labels and stuff too. NVMe, type C, RAM slots, very cool. That's gonna be awkward if you guys ever change the layout of the board. Is the layout of the board ever gonna change? - Not enough that it would shift that around. - Okay, and it just goes in like that and the whole thing just like fits by friction or? - You still need to screw on. - You sure? - Yeah. - Because it seems to be in right now. - Yeah, because our design is great. - Yeah, okay, oh, I get it. The screw holes have what are called screw bosses. And these actually push down on the motherboard everywhere where a screw goes into the top of the chassis, securing it with no motherboard screws at all. - Yep. - So if I wasn't busy chit-chatting, I could do this whole operation in like two minutes. - Mm-hmm, by yourself, yeah. - By myself, you sure, by myself? I mean, did you watch the video where I upgraded my laptop? - (laughs) Yeah. - So now I just do up all the screws? - Mm-hmm, yeah, and actually we can put on the, if you want to abandon this laptop, you can use the audio card to insert here. - Audio card. - Also for the Wi-Fi card, you can put here. - Oh, we also didn't put any RAM in it. Now you included the screws for those cards, but I couldn't help noticing that there's no antenna for the Wi-Fi card. - People can use the external antenna from here, or they can also buy our antenna module as laptops in our marketplace. - But you don't include it in the case. - Yeah, we don't include it in the case. - Mm, okay, I probably would want that included in the case, but, okay. So right now I have no audio interface unless I buy another one then. - Uh, you can... - Right, but I still need my laptop. - Okay, so you can use our audio, we got audio card. - Oh, right, I could just get an audio USB-C module. I also don't have that though. - You don't have that card? - Not right now. Now all we need to do is install RAM, SSD. I gotta say, aside from that I, you know, didn't order some of the components that I need, that is pretty much the easiest computer I've ever built. We're done now, right? - [Esther] Yeah. - [Linus] I didn't miss anything this time. - Um, not for this time. - On a laptop, obviously your power button is wired up to the motherboard somewhere, where's my power button? - [Esther] Power button here, we highlight in orange. - So basically it's a little piece of plastic that presses a button on the mainboard itself to power it on and off. USB-A, USB-C, HDMI, And instead of putting in my second USB-C, I'm actually gonna borrow this two and a half gig module from Nirav, I'm gonna try... (module clicks) Sure, there we go. Now we have display, USB, and Ethernet. We just gotta find somewhere to power it on. Wait, power. Oh right, USB-C, that makes sense. Took me a sec. - It's upside down. - Oh. - This way. - The last step is to power it up. Cooler Master was kind enough to lend us their Motion 1 chair demo here. So can I just start on plugging things? - [Cooler Master Rep] Sure. - Okay, fantastic. Now we borrowed a display port module from Nirav because of course he has one of those. Why change your cable when you can change your IO? The light's on, right? - Yeah, the lights on, it needs some time to... - There we go. (audience cheers) - Yay. Okay, you guys are selling it a little hard here. You can't blame them for being passionate about what they do. And there's that Windows update. (audience laughs) - Okay. - I just wanna shut the thing down. More updates, no. It's time for the big show. He was so like, oh no, I can't let you have the AMD motherboard. Oh, the firmware's not ready before we started this video. Oh no, the other media will be mad that I let you have the AMD motherboard. So he made me promise to say it's because I'm an investor that I get to play with the AMD motherboard. - Do you want to provide $200,000? We will give you an AMD mainboard, anyone in the world out there. (laughs) - I wouldn't be surprised if someone is crazy enough to do it. You gotta be careful with stuff like that. Now in theory, I don't have to do basically anything here, right? - You reverse what we just did and put it back together. - What exactly am I putting in my computer though? Is this Ryzen 7, Ryzen 9? - [Nirav] This is the Ryzen 7040 series. So this year's latest platform from AMD. - This is very similar to what you're seeing in handheld gaming systems like the ROG Ally, which, I mean, I know that you guys have never built the Framework 14 as a, oh, it's a 13, isn't it? Framework 13, sorry, as a gaming machine but... - Yeah, the gaming performance is there, especially with two sticks of RAM. - I am so excited. Wait, oh, you already put the RAM in for me. - [Nirav] Preloaded for you. - [Linus] Oh, that's boring, 16 gigs of ram, that's it? - I'm sorry, this is also a Ryzen 5, this is not the Ryzen 7 version 'cause we gave the engineering team all the good mainboards. - So if I understand you correctly, people have to give you $200,000 and you're gonna give them a half-baked Ryzen 5 - Ryzen 5, yes. It's great, Ryzen 5's really great though. - You know, for an evil super villain, you present very nicely. Tell me something, did you guys completely reuse the same thermal solution? - It is almost the same, the fans' the same, the heat pipes are the same, the heat spreader is actually different to match the die. - [Linus] Got it, because it's... - The height's all different. The XY's a little different and the power regulation around it is different. - I have to confess, I jebaited you in here a little bit because I wanted to ask some questions on behalf of the community starting with why the hell did this take so long? - When you're a startup, as you know, having been a new company many years ago, it is hard to get attention from the right people. You have to build credibility, you have to put in the work, you have to put in the hours and people realize that you're serious, people see that you're doing something important, people see that the community's getting excited and then we start to unlock better ability to do more. And so ultimately the question is like why? Why isn't Framework done anything? - Yeah, yeah, why haven't they done anything? - (laughs) The answer is... - He's asking himself the big question. - Why haven't we done anything? No, the answer is either we don't have enough people, we have to focus, we really, really have to focus, we have more ideas than people, we don't have the money. Sometimes people give us money to help us out, which is great. Or we haven't been able to get the right connections at the right partner to do the thing that we wanted to do. - So I got jebaited. You lured me in here to ask for more money. - (laughs) I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna say anything. - He actually didn't say no. - I didn't say no. - Okay, I guess I'll just screw down the motherboard first, right? - You can, yeah. - Okay. - You should make sure you're not pinching any of the cables under the main board. - I wouldn't do that. - [Nirav] Okay, but you, it was like one there and one there. (laughs) - Gee, relax. You know, for someone who didn't even bring me the new higher capacity battery, you're being awfully critical. - I was gonna ask about that actually. If you wanted one, I could have brought one. (laughs) Same with the panel, actually, the matte screen. - I'm okay with the glossy screen. I like seeing the outline of my key caps. Okay, then I get my Wi-Fi over kind of here-ish, right? - Yeah, you can put 'em through the routing channels, these rubber channels. Also this, we have a new Wi-Fi bracket that's a lot easier to use, this is the old one. - Oh, okay, cool. - Which I did not bring. - Now you said the label's not right on this. Is it Wi-Fi 7? - It is, it is Wi-Fi 6E, but I just reused a case that we had on here. - Really? You're gonna give me an Intel box and you're gonna give me a MediaTek Wi-Fi module. - It's an AMD MediaTek combo, RZ616 module, co-branded AMD MediaTek. So the trick to this is you keep your finger on it while you're putting it in there. - Yeah, well hold on, the first trick is that I have to find the screw. Because I think it's stuck to a magnet somewhere. Oh no, no, we got it. Now I'll just plug in my display and hopefully not ruined that this time. I kind of feel like I should have put this ribbon on earlier. - Well, it's really the... - Why didn't you warn me? - No, I told you you shouldn't have taken it off from this side. (laughs) - Why didn't you do a better job of stopping me? - Sure. - Oh, okay, it's labeled. - [Nirav] It is labeled, actually it doesn't... - U and V. - Both sides the same, but we label it anyway. - It looks like I'll have to wait a little bit to actually have a secondary computer made out of my main board, but this is such a cool concept. I mean, you guys said before, yeah, you can reuse your old mainboard for something, but I feel like over the last two, three years, that sort of aspirational dream has actually come true. Like if you buy a Framework today, whether it's 13th gen Intel, you wait a little bit, you get the Ryzen one once it's not $200,000, that is a very usable machine. By the time you're pulling the motherboard out of it, putting it in a cool little chassis like this and then repurposing it for a media PC or for a retro gaming box. - Definitely. - Or whatever else. Not to mention that on the Intel side, you've got support for Thunderbolt. So you can even hook an eGPU up to the thing if those ever get affordable. Wait, you guys should do an eGPU. - [Nirav] We did show a demo one at our event, a concept demo of one. - See, they were all like, no, you have to come to our event to see everything. And I was like, look, no, I'm not coming to the event. And they're like, well then, we're just not gonna bring everything. So I didn't even know. I actually didn't watch the event. - Are you okay? - So I did not know that. - That's fair, I didn't watch your last video either. - It's amazing how quickly this relationship went from let's support each other to do great things in the PC industry to purely adversarial, record time, I think, now hold on, I'm not done yet. - No, that's right. - That's power I got, I got my cable routed. I got... - You do have to be careful in this... - Yeah, yeah, yeah, you have to be careful, Mom. So now all I gotta do is put my keyboard, track pad back on here, I really like this cable the way that it kind of is nice and long and you can kind of, you know, - Yeah this is called... - Oh, I think I just powered it on. - I think, yeah. - Is that okay? - Uh, yeah. - I mean that's good, right? So the blue light means powered on, right? - No, actually that blue light's a debugging light. So I'm not sure why it's on. - Oh, sick. - That's not on the actual shipping systems, that's for debugging. - Oh, okay, and then I have more flashing red lights. In fact, there's flashing red lights all over the motherboard. - But you are powering on. - That's good. Oh, but I'm powering off. I should maybe cover it. - Put this back together. - Are you sure you'd like me to cover it now? - Yeah, you're good, well, yeah, no, you're good. - First boot outside of the lab, AMD Framework laptop. (hands beat) - I actually don't know the answer to this, whether this is gonna boot so this is genuinely a surprise. - I had to be extremely, let's say, assertive to get him to let me show you guys the AMD motherboard. It's really, really not done yet. There's a ton of firmware work to be done. Like the thing with going from Intel generation to Intel generation is two things. One, he didn't say this, I just know this. Intel has a lot of structures in place to support their OEMs that AMD doesn't always have analogs for. Number two is going from Intel generation to Intel generation, there's a lot less to rework, but it turned on anyway. - I'm genuinely surprised it happily that that works. - Now he made me promise not to go any further than the login screen. I didn't go any further than that on camera. Can you tell me why I can't go to the desktop? - The firmware and the drivers are definitely not baked. Also, I didn't bring any drivers. So you're running Intel drivers on an AMD mainboard right now. - What could go wrong? - Neither AMD or Intel is gonna give either of us the answer to that. - I'll tell you what, here, hold on, hold on. I'm altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it further. We go until wait, hold on, until the slightest abnormal behavior and then the video hard cuts. So we won't show any of it. - Can't do it. - You can't do it? - Can't do it. This is it, the... - What do you mean can't? My keyboard doesn't work, no, my keyboard does work. - Your keyboard does work, wait... - So I can do it. - But you can't log in right now. Actually, you probably can't log in. - No, I tried, I probably can. He said it. - No, it probably can't. - Oh, can't, you think I can't log in? Do you think my fingerprint will work? - No, your PIN is required. - Wait, what? - [Nirav] But your PIN can't be used 'cause your PIN is no longer available. (laughs) - Why did you break my laptop? - I'm sorry. - Okay, but actually, hold on a second. What does all this mean? - So the key to all of this is that when we actually ship this, we have guides that we publish, step by step super easy to follow guides. - Got it. - If you follow it step by step, everything just works. - Got it. - If you do this, it happened to get this far, which is great actually. So I think we're stuck at this point 'cause you're not on a network 'cause you don't have the Wi-Fi drivers, so you can't connect your Microsoft account to log into it. - Which you did intentionally. What's the ETA for this? - So we are starting shipping in Q3, batch one is in Q3, And actually right now we're all the way out in Q4. So we've got a ton of demand for AMD. - Oh, I see, so if people wanna get one this year... - They do probably - Now. - Need to order, yeah. - Okay, and full disclosure, I'm an investor in Framework Laptop Inc, or whatever the company is called. - Framework Computer Inc. - So you make ink? - We get asked a lot to make a printer so... - Man, this might not be just throwing my money away after all and this might not be throwing away this segue to our sponsor Squarespace.

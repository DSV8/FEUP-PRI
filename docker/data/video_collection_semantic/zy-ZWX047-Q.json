Here is the Front LCD and Power button:  GoPro 4 Battery:  Small Tool Kit:   LET ME KNOW IF THOSE LINKS STOP WORKING!  GoPro cameras are probably the most abused cameras on the market.  Maybe its because they call them 'Action cameras'?  Either way, the nice thing about these GoPro 4's is that they can be repaired pretty easy.  They have the same internal connections that a smart phone has. So if you have been inside a phone... You already know your way around a GoPro.

    "transcript": "Today Im going to be repairing a GoPro Hero 4. The top button and the side button do not work. During a wreck, the centrifugal force of the GoPro tumbling messed up the internal components and Ill show you what they look like here in a second. But without the top button and the side button, you cant record video and you cant connect it to a phone to see what youre recording. So the GoPro is effectively useless and needs to be repaired. So lets open it up and bring it back to a working order. Going to slide the battery out of the bottom and then the face plate pops off of the front housing. There are a few little clasps and adhesive holding it down to the main frame. Lift it up and set it off to the side. And remove the button as well; its just sitting on top of the little mechanism. There are four screws holding the internals into the frame. Remove the SD card as well, and then you can slide the internals out of the back housing. There are two cables along the left side so be very gentle when youre pulling it apart. One is for the power, the bottom one, and then the top one is what controls the shutter button and the settings button on the side. You can see that the connector that connects the ribbon cable to the motherboard is just ripped completely off the board and this is what happened when the GoPro was taking a tumble. So lets swap out this main board. There is one screw on the back, two screws on the front that were going to remove. And then were going to disconnect the power button and LCD ribbon from the back of the motherboard. Slide that out of the little slot. Then there are four screws on the back of the sensor and the little Lego-like connection that holds it to the motherboard. Remove that and then the front lens will just pop off from the motherboard. You can see here that I have two broken GoPros: the number 3 and the number 7; Ive labeled them myself. And the top latch is broken from the number 3 GoPro so were just going to swap the motherboards. Take the motherboard from the number 7 GoPro and put it into the housing from GoPro number 3. Going to remove the broken latch from the ribbon cable here, then I can plug the power into the working motherboard and plug the ribbon cable into the working latch on the good motherboard thats not damaged. Lock it into place with the little latch and then stick the black tape on top so it doesnt come loose again. And then slide the lens into the motherboard. Now this is good information to have because if you have two broken GoPros you can Frankenstein them together into one working one. Or you can buy broken GoPros locally off your local Craigs List or EBay and splice them together and make a little bit of cash. Im going to take the sensor, put those four screws into place, and then use the Lego connection to get it back on the motherboard. There are two screws on the front of the housing and one screw on the rear. You can also buy replacement LCDs and lenses; basically everything on this GoPro camera is modular which is very very convenient for repair guys like myself. Im going to plug in the LCD ribbon cable into the back of the motherboard and latch it down. Make sure to put that tape into place as well because these GoPros are dropped fairly regularly and you dont want that to come loose. Once its down to the housing you can take the battery and plug that back into place. Turn the GoPro on and it looks like the shutter button is reacting. Im going to put an SD card into the side and double check. And it looks like that solved our problem. That broken connector on the old motherboard was the issue. It was not receiving signal from the top and side buttons, but now that weve swapped the motherboard from the GoPro number 7 into the GoPro number 3 housing, everything is working. Just for reference, the GoPro number 7 was not working either. It had problems with the power transfer from the battery to the motherboard. But that was part of the housing, and now we have a working GoPro so its worth it. Make sure that power button is situated in the correct spot so it lines up with the housing. And then latch the front face plate into place. I will link whatever replacement parts that I can find down in the video description right below this video. If you have any questions leave them in the comments, and as always, thanks a ton for watching. All of the behind the scenes stuff can be found on my Snapchat, Twitter and Instagram. Im most active on Twitter and Instagram. Thanks for watching.",

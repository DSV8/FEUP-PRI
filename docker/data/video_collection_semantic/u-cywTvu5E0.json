    "transcript": "oh my god dude I gotta show you something you've really got to stop drinking you respawn man oh no this is something else all right this better be good all right you ready you had some respawn didn't you okay watch this how did you do that have I had too much fries I have no idea I have an idea it's already open well hello there where'd you come from it don't matter it's a back where I'm going well I don't really need a new Mouse right now sure we'll see everybody loves a 4-way hidden d-pad and a cool OLED display plus I'm quiet sensitive at 24,000 dpi plus RGB you got a try what was I thinking saying no to you the MM 830 by cool master the mouse you didn't see coming we'll check it out below Wow so it is finally here I'm really excited to actually be using the Razer Blade Pro 17 you can get up to speed with an awesome preview Eber did right over here but I'm trying to get into the mindset of somebody who might actually use this on a daily basis because I've considered switching to a notebook as my main many many times away from my desktop as for my Razer blade 15 this has been my main production machine on the go it has treated me really well in terms of the specs but to be honest gaming on this thing is super uncomfortable at this form factor it's not something that I enjoy doing it constantly needs to be plugged into the wall to get the best performance you cannot rely on battery power as you can with my macbook for example like right now if I would close it while it's sleeping the next day it would die and also unless it's completely idle the shell itself the aluminum shell is either warm or hot and the fans are spinning and are audible now the Razer blade 17 is just a super-sized version of the 50 model but with much better cooling better speakers better i/o better Razer software and slightly different configuration and pricing and so we were talking with Mike and Eber about what is this machine want to be is it the gaming station giving the full HD resolution display which is easy to run given this hardware but also 144 Hertz is a fantastic experience or is it a workstation given the screen comes factory calibrated which is nice but it's only a 300 NIT brightness so it's not exactly suitable for outdoors or is it kind of like a perfect hybrid but that is where the challenge comes in because there is currently no 4k option as that is being saved for the studio edition of the pro 17 and that will come with 4k OLED and RTX Quadro plus the whole thing with studio Edition versus Pro Edition is kind of confusing because the studio Edition is like for creatives only giving the RTX Quadro graphics but then what is the pro demographic is it gamers or is it creators meanwhile the Blake 15 has more configuration options with 4k OLED already available at 240 Hertz option in there too with 9 gen CPUs with the price Delta is decreasing as we move up the r-tx chain and so the pro 17 looks to be slightly competitive versus the blades 15 price wise in the RTX 2070 and the RTX 2080 models but what's up with the 512 gigabyte of SSD storage on all pro 17 models not even the terabyte for the pro market and especially at this price point come on I will say there is an open MDOT 2 slot inside the pro 17 so it is user upgradeable you can expand your storage but still not giving us a terabyte is highly disappointing now physically it is quite impressive that we get so much extra screen with only a slightly thicker body but with pretty slim bezels and a super clean interior format however this thing does not fit in any of my backpacks and it's also 31 percent heavier versus my blade 15 making it less portable the other concern for me would be the massive surface area that is black aluminum on the lid and around the keyboard that immediately gets covered with finger marks which is why I install the skin on my blade 15 which looks awesome which is going to be a must for the pro 17 as well and so the main difference between the blade 15 include a new hinge system that is incredibly smooth and is now more open to accommodate the extra ventilation design the new vapor chamber cooling here is excellent delivers much better performance versus the blade 15 with exactly the same hardware so the CPU clocks higher and the same thing with the GPU that are not throttling and maintain nice consistent clocks throughout and my full performance analysis between the pro 17 and the blade 15 will come a bit later they've also added more France to the front of the chassis for intake to channel all that air flow through the vapor chamber which is great but that also means that there's less room for the battery and the battery capacity inside the Pro 17 is actually smaller than the blade 15 so it looks like they prioritized on performance and cooling on the pro 17 versus battery life and I'm totally ok with that if you plan on taking this thing on the road and actually working on this on your lap then you were doing it wrong and a battery bank is the same 230 what hours has my blade 15 so nice and compact you just have to worry about fitting that machine into some bag and not so much about the power brick as for port selection everything meets the pro criteria there's a 2.5 gigabit ethernet port all of the USB ports are gen 2 there's a USB C and Thunderbolt 3 ports plus a UHS 3 USB card reader that is definitely appreciated for all who use that media I know some people were hoping for a numpad given the much larger interior surface area but I'm really content with the keyboard layout outside from the really awkward arrow up key as for the actual keyboard that feels identical to my blade 15 nice crispy keys beautiful RGB illumination however the trackpad feels slightly worse they're still using Windows precision drivers and the actual surface feels amazing but the actual navigation feels like there's a slightly delay or like latency versus on my place 15 everything is snappy and feels like one-to-one but unfortunately that is not the case with my pro 17 and so from my initial impressions with this machine I'm happy the direction they've taken in terms of redesigning it to look like the blade 15 that's smarter and it's beautiful it's compact yet the performance seems to be there so make sure to stay tuned for my full performance analysis between the two machines and I'm kind of leaning towards this to be my mobile workstation now because the larger screen feels great although again the whole idea of north having a 4k option on the pro model is so confusing to me I know it's coming with a studio edition but like the UI and the 17 inch form factor you'd expect to be slightly sharper with like low things in the creative apps and that is one major drawback and so perhaps the whole throw distinction is like a pro or something like that because I can't think of why Razer would not include a 4k display option on this thing just yet I guess they're saving it for the studio edition and don't want to jeopardize the hype surrounding that machine alright guys so those are my first impressions with the Pro 17 if you've been on the market for a notebook on the bigger side why why do you need something like it let me know in the comments I'd love to get into the mindset of those exact people so that I can deliver a full out review on something that you might potentially want now Dimitri thanks so much for watching and this thunder will not stop going huge rain outside thanks for watching I'll talk to you next video",

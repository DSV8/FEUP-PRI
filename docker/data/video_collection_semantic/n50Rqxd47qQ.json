    "transcript": "today's video is another prime example of why I should never let you peer pressure me into your terrible video ideas invariably it ends up with me wasting three days of my life waiting for Half-Life to install on the CD that I'm trying to use as a game Drive whoever sent me that email I hope you're real proud of yourself because this was a really annoying video now there are some pretty massive limitations to using physical media like CDs as in external games Drive the first limitation is capacity CDs for example just have a poultry 700 Megs of space available which is going to limit us to games from like 1873. now this problem is alleviated somewhat as we move up the food chain but even the Blu-rays I have here are just 25 gigs which considering that the average modern game is like 5 terabytes that's that's not a whole lot the other major limitation is read and write speeds this 12x CD for example has a max read and write speed of just 1.8 megabytes per second which is very little so all in all this is a recipe for some properly terrible game performance at least in terms of loading speeds but we'll see what happens we'll see what happens but first off we need a Blu-ray Drive something that's quite archaic considering that most modern cases don't even have a space to mount it properly but it's fine we don't to mount it all pretty like we just need to connect it to the system so let's check out which one we got now for the kiddos watching this weird device is called a disk drive and how it works is you press this button once it's plugged in obviously and then the little cage comes out and you put your CD DVD or Blu-ray in here you press the button again it closes and then it reads the information off of the Blu-ray or whatever and then puts it onto your computer so it's a way of getting information onto a computer that doesn't involve the internet I know that sounds like a ridiculous concept but we used to use these quite a lot back in the day but it does feel a little bit like interacting with a fossil at this point anyway this is some LG drive that has lots of Blu-ray speeds it's actually a very fast Drive although the actual media is a lot slower so it's pretty much irrelevant but anyway now that I've patronized the people who don't watch this video Let's Run games of it now like I said before most modern cases don't have any way to accommodate a DVD or Blu-ray Drive so we're gonna have to be a little bit ghetto about it mmm that's a very high effort looking implementation anyway let's start off with some CDs now the most difficult part about running a game of a CD is finding a game small enough to run as you can see even a game like Skyrim is 10 gig GTA 5 is a 108 gigs so we need like 900 CDs to install GTA 5 on after spending a while looking around my steam Library I only found a couple of options that would fit on a CD and the first one was a bit of a debate oh apparently the Half-Life 2 lost coast technology showcase should fit I I think this would be the most demanding game that we can install on a CD first off let's see how quickly it launches off an SSD oh 16 seconds that's nice and Speedy and going from the main menu to actually playing was even faster it literally took two seconds okay and the game obviously is running very well so let's see what happens when instead of an SSD we use a CD as a game Drive oh it was lying to me it needs two gigs what the hell this shouldn't be allowed anyway I I guess we're gonna have to use Half-Life one then that's that's our other choice wow installed Half-Life 1 from 1998 barely fits on a CD let's see how long it takes to install which immediately did not go well I think steam has his theme is crap no no we're good I love that it just downloaded for a bit and now it's writing at 600 gigabytes per second but soon the extent of the problem started to become clear oh this is gonna take a really long isn't it and the longer it ran the lower the disk usage fell it's dropped down to two kilobytes per second now never mind we're at 200 bytes per second now very good and then I made the terrible decision to try and restart the download yeah that just made steam crash oh please tell me I'm not gonna have to start again unfortunately I did but that was later's problem suddenly there was a more pressing concern okay so it's kind of just destroyed everything at this point because the system's just stuck on restarting so let's just kill it with the power button what the hell like the system is not booting anymore but the moment I ejected the CD the system immediately booted I don't know Windows 11 does not like using a CD as storage I can tell you that after Windows launched I put the CD back in and things just started going haywire again yeah I don't know every time I put the CD in things just start crashing I don't know what's going on and then if I remove it everything just works it's like the moment the moment the CD is introduced into the system everything just goes to the system even refuses to boot with the CDN and when steam crashed again after sitting through the 48 minute process a second time I felt like I had one of two options either I find out where the person who recommended this lives so that I could do some mid-tier vandalism to their house or install Windows 10 on the system to see if maybe that helps and I decided why not both Windows has been reinstalled so we've got take what 17 of trying to install a game on this CD uh so let's try again but aside from a promising start something terrible happened oh the PC went to sleep halfway through the process and it's broken everything oh it's still not working I just wasted a whole day so I angrily decided to change the power settings and let the installation run overnight oh has it worked I think it has and after a full minute of what sounded like two Transformers furiously having sex with a fax machine it was clear that it did work the game launched in 53 seconds compared to one second on the SSD let's see how long it takes for it to load into the game it's only slightly slower than the SSD instead of just under a second we got over a minute to load in now in terms of actual game performance we're getting the same like it hasn't impacted this much but I'm pretty sure the moment we get to yeah see every now and then things are gonna have to load and the game is Just Gonna collapse under the weight of it yeah see there we go loading's happening and it just broke it just broke the game okay we're not on the train anymore oh it's actually stopping for me that's cute can I get back on it now I could not and that was it for me and CD gaming installing Half-Life on a DVD was a much less painful process I didn't get any of the crashes and at the end of the day it took significantly less time for the installation to happen very good this time it just took 17 minutes to install a 40 minute game that's up from like maybe two hours I don't even know I I lost interest and launching the game was also significantly faster whoa look at that that is a massive Improvement so next up we're doing loading into the game and hoping that the game actually works this time that'll also be a big Improvement three two one start yeah I mean that was almost as fast as the SSD and Half-Life even worth this time but when I tried to install a bigger game things came crashing down again oh oh steams crashed again after such a long time I need to stop clicking things but either way I'm I'm not gonna sit through this process again um let's let's try Blu-rays after dropping in the rewritable Blu-ray which on a side note is very difficult to find for sale these days they're super rare but anyway once I dropped it in we had some initially promising results which quickly fell apart that's not a great sign oh yeah I I don't know Simon Simon's gone wrong again and now the Blu-ray is not verifying it's not done anything in ages and when my second attempt failed again after ages of waiting I decided to restart my system at which point the system once again refused to boot with the Blu-ray in it and I was just done three days was enough this is as much time as I'm gonna spend on this stupid video thank you for watching until the next one bye thank you",

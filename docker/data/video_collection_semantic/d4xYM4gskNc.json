    "transcript": "- So you're stuck inside. You want to go the gym and exercise. You can't. I don't know why you would ever want to go to a gym. I don't like them personally. And maybe that's why the product that I'm gonna be looking at today is perfect for me. You can workout at home, and pay a lot of money for it. That's right. We're taking a look at Supernatural VR. It's a workout app for the Oculus Quest. And uh, before I try it out I need to clear some space, for VR, so just uh, just a sec. I don't even need to workout, look how strong I am. Okay, no I need help with this. Okay, get rid of this. Oh, what the heck. You want to make sure you have room to be, to get all that fitness done, you know. I need to setup the Guardian space. If you're already familiar with Supernatural, you know that it's basically a clone of Beat Saber. That's the accusation anyway, it might not be. I mean I'm hoping that it's something a little more, that's why, that's why I wanted to try it out, but. I'm gonna need some room to kinda like. And play area. Now how do I clap to sync, to help them sync? (laughing) - All right here we go, let's enter the Matrix. What? I need to update the Quest. (laughing) - [Andy] Why? So much for entering the Matrix. I just wanted to get some exercise. Andy I can't see my controllers. There's one. Oh they appeared. (laughing) - Andy, are you ready to get Supernatural in here? - [Andy] Hell yeah! - Heck yeah! Boom! Whoa! Oh my. You can't see what I'm seeing right now Andy, but I have to make an account. They have a thirty day free trial, and then after that, it's twenty bucks a month. And the reason that they're charging that much, is because they have tracks from like, popular artists and stuff. And, personal training, and there's people in here, that apparently tell you what to do and how to squat. Sounds like a gym, exactly. We'll have to see, anyways. I don't have an account so I have to make an account. The most exciting part of any workout. Is filling in your personal details. - [Leanne] I'm Leanne, - Oh hello! - [Leanne] Welcome to Supernatural. - I'm supposed to be calibrating my lunge, you know how that is. - You are gonna workout everything in your body. - Everything in my body? Oh so they're not sabers, they're bats. So that alone is worth the twenty bucks I think. - [Leanne] The harder you hit the target, the better. - Oh geez, oh here we go. I'm actually doing it. Ho ho! I feel so silly. Hit it as hard as I can! Oh that was cool. Okay so this is where it gets interesting Andy. I'm gonna be squatting. Here come the triangles. Holy crap. Oh lunge to the left. Dab. This is the first time I've really exercised, probably in months. Now I don't think we can actually play these songs, because of copyright. OH I hit it the wrong, with the wrong bat. This is like a workout. She's talking to me the whole time, and I don't think I'm listening at all. I'm going through fricking hyperspace right now. (laughing) - Oh! I look so good right. Yes. Yes. She's still talking. 97% accuracy though Andy. Normally it's 200 bucks a year, but right now they're saying it's 149 a year. So before we go pro, you want a pro VPN. That's right, Private Internet Access is the sponsor for this video. Private Internet Access is a VPN that encrypts your connection and uses a safe protected IP. You can install on up to five devices on Windows, IOS, Macs, Mac OS, Linux, Android, all the good ones. And they've an Internet kill switch that keeps you in control of your connection. Try it right now with their thirty day money back guarantee at the link below. Let's do this. All right let me just see if I can join this trial then. Start thirty day free trial. Oh I have to get the app. All right I have the app. Here we go this is the real deal. They actually list the names of the coach, the coaches. So these are real people. Here we go. Dancing to a song that I know, is like pretty nice. (grunting) - Oh that's cool. Oh geez, what? Okay that's another one right away. (laughing) - I don't like it, I probably look so stupid. I don't want to look stupid! What? I guess that answers the question about whether, you can actually get a workout from this. Cause I'm definitely getting a workout. Oh what the? Geez, come on! It started all ready! Where am I? - Congratulations. - Screw you Karen. Oh wow she's telling me to stretch. Oh and she's giving us advice. Okay let's take this off. Am I sweaty? - [Andy] You are. - Sorry to whoever uses the Oculus Quest next. Just gonna squirt some Purell on it. It was basically Beat Saber, with some added, you know, some of this stuff. Holy crap my quads though. I'm, I'm very sweaty. I wanted to keep going. I think if I wasn't playing a game then I would have, just stopped a long time ago. It seems like mostly it's your quads. I got some quads, I got some hamstring or whatever the, I don't know muscles. I feel like you could get pretty similar value just playing some really hard Beat Saber tracks. I think they're dreaming if they think people are gonna pay twenty bucks a month for this normally. Twelve fifty is maybe, doable But like. I don't know what do you guys think? Have you tried it? It's a thirty day free trial, if you've got a Quest, you might as well check it out. - [Andy] It's very similar to the Nintendo Ring... - Oh Ring Fit Adventure! - [Andy] Yup. - Yeah that's the thing, if you're gonna spend 12.50 a month on this, how much is Ring Fit Adventure, Andy? - [Andy] 79.99, US, and 100ish, Canadian. - Which is cheaper then a year, of this thing. Are they comparable? Have you done Ring Fit? - [Andy] Yeah I did. - What did you think? - [Andy] It's pretty good. - Andy likes Ring Fit. And you have that forever, so. Hey, if you enjoyed this video, subscribe to Short Circuit. For more stuff, probably not exactly like this, this is a little different, we're doing software, but, it's something. (laughing) - I'm so sweaty. Now I have to drive home. I have to have my hair look good inside the VR world, or what will the coaches think of me? They're gonna be like, this guys not serious about working out.",

    "transcript": "- We will continue reading the tech news until it's depleted. And then, God help us. (screams) The EU's mission to reign in Big Tech continues with the European Parliament, passing almost unanimously a preliminary proposal. (trills) That's a piece. That would force Apple to finally just slap a USB-C port on the iPhone. For Pete's sake. - [Linus] Come on. Stick it in there. - They've already put it on the iPads and MacBook. So like what's the hold up? - [Linus] I don't get it. - The EU's Radio Equipment directive, would mandate USB-C be included on all small to medium size electronic gadgets. With exemptions for devices that are, too small for USB-C port. Like smartwatches, health trackers or other tiny wearables. It also calls for a standardization of wireless charging standards. Which could affect Apple's new-ish MagSafe system. Or no, any future phone that's like, this port, start really for charging. Wireless is the predominant charging. - [Linus] This port's just for fun. - No. EU member states will hash out the details after another vote in May. But, the EU ain't done here. Parliament is also soon to expected to to pass a new law, called the Digital Services Act. DSA. Which would force online platforms to better police illegal content and ban the targeting of users based on religion, gender or sexuality. So don't worry too much about the future of technology and the internet. Europe is here to save us all except Americans. Meanwhile, Google is trying to make your phone less helpful, if you're ever planning on using it to record a phone call. A new policy will ban third party call recording apps from using Android's accessibility API. Which allows them to access the audio functions on a given device. Now, to be fair to Google, this ban is meant to escape legal liability. Since laws governing whose consent is required before recording a phone call, differ depending on where you are. But there are lots of scenarios in which having the option, would be extremely useful. Like, a phone interview, or a call with a shady company. Or as part of an elaborate punk prank. Watch out, Linus, Google's gonna punk you. - [Linus] What? - [James] Thankfully, there are some workarounds, but man, this almost makes you wanna call Europe. - [Linus] Help us Europe, again. - Hello. And just like Microsoft, Sony is also reportedly considering introducing ads into free to play games on its console, the Play Station 5, have you heard of it? Sony's plans are currently limited to ads in game menus. But, like Microsoft, the company is apparently talking with its partners throw in ads, situated in the game world. Like say, virtual billboards and cyber punk, for Atari, \"Blade Runner\" reference. - [Linus] Look at the beautiful people. - \"They're Just Movies Podcast.\" Have you heard of it? We're on it. There's also talk of rewarding players with items like skins for watching enough ads. But only, in a way that doesn't disrupt the gameplay experience. That's funny, 'cause I would say, ads disrupt gameplay by definition. But, they could also create new revenue opportunities for free-to-play game developers which, I like. Who says games need to be fun and not dystopian anyway? - [Linus] That's it. That's just rules. - Play to earn baby. Riley. - Now it's time for quick bits brought to you by Zoho CRM, the solution for managing your businesses' sales, marketing and customer service.

AMD might be on the path through revolutionizing the processor world, once more with their Phoenix APUs. (Linus shrieks) The chips are expected next year with up to 24 RDNA compute units, which would technically make them more powerful than the Xbox series S. S. - S. S. - S. - Which has 20. And if the Phoenix chips are built with RDNA 3, they could even outperform AMD's low end, discreet graphics cards. Do you think AMD called them Phoenix 'cause it's like, Verizon has been just okay, but now it's like, they're gonna rise from the ashes like a Phoenix? Do you think that? - [Linus] That would be, maybe they did that. - Taiwan based company, Thermalright has launched a bending corrector frame for Intel's Alder Lake processors. That is designed to prevent them from bending or warping. An issue that has been observed amongst some 12 gen chips. - [Linus] Only in the wild. - [James] Although, the anti bending unit goes directly against Intel's strong recommendation to not use such mods. I can understand why enthusiasts would want to protect their expensive new processor. They can always just tell Intel they're framing it for display purposes only. - [Linus] I wrote that as a joke, but I'm assuming some people do that. - [James] Elon Musk is still gunning for Twitter announcing on 4,20 that he had secured a 46.5 billion package. 21 billion of which was his own money from Tesla stock, to fund his hostile takeover bid. The rest coming from Morgan Stanley. Twitter's board has not given Musk a formal answer to his offer. But will be facing scrutiny from shareholders, who stand to gain from the deal. As is usually the case with Elon, it's unclear whether he's doing this out of real concern for free speech or, whether he just needs another way to distract people from videos of Teslas, driving themselves into three and a half million dollar private jets. - [Linus] Like every week. - [James] After basically ignoring it for more than 10 years, Apple has officially pulled the plug on maCOS Server. The $20 app that provided a few server specific features which have now largely been integrated into macOS itself. But I'm still having trouble comprehending this, because Apple people, those people don't use servers. - [Linus] What the heck? - They keep everything in Moleskine notebooks and vision boards and stuff and word clouds. - [Linus] They have all your information at the cafes. - The servers work there. And while the GPUs stock and price landscape might be returning to some kind of normalcy, the worldwide chip shortage is still very much an issue. According to a Bloomberg report, at least one major industrial conglomerate, one conglomerate, has resorted to tearing apart used washing machines, stripping out their semiconductors and using them in their own products. We're in the cannibalism stage. It won't be long now. (imitates cocking gun) (screams) We'll have to wait until next week to see how things play out. So come back on Monday for more tech news, just the way grandma likes it. - [Linus] Grandma love tech news.",

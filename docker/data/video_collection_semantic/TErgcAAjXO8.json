    "transcript": "Shall we dance. So a little while ago, maybe, I don't know, maybe, a year ago now? I got hit up by these guys, a company called Gray. and it was around the time that the iPhone 6s launched And they said \"We got this super high end luxury bumper case for the iPhone Oh, you know you should probably be sending that to Unbox Therapy so I can show the world what it's about Now, they got back in touch with me and they said they stepped the game up even further! They said \"This one is even more luxurious than the last one, and now it's for the iPhone 7 plus\" So, in front of me I have the latest and greatest from Gray. What kind of price do you expect to pay for something so limited? Well the one in front of me, there's only 100 of them in the world. It's plated in 24K gold and this thing retails for 1000 US dollars. In other words, more, potentially, than the iPhone 7 plus you're gonna put inside of it! but of course you're a Bollon, so you don't care. That doesn't effect you, are you kidding me? A thousand? What's a thousand ? A thousand dollars dropped out of your pocket on your way to work today What's that thing they said about Bill Gates? \"Bill gates makes so much money, he's worth so much money, that if he drops a 100 dollars on the ground It would cost him more to stop and pick it up then to get to the actual place that he was going so he could keep earning at the rate that he was earning...\"? Essentially, he's making more than a 100 dollars a second! ...it was something like that. Since there are so many people in the audience who are just like Bill gates, today I have for you the 1000 dollar iPhone 7 plus bumper. Here we go. The experience is luxurious from the get go here, \"To our dear customer\" You see that jack? You better be a dear customer for a thousand bucks US \"The person who follows the crowd will usually go no further, then the crowd\" You hear that?! Even the container that it comes in is made out of aluminum, machined. You hear that sound effect? When that thing opens up? Here we go, let me.. I'm gonna do that one more time for you, watch it Oh! The very end part like *sching*, Wow! Look at that! Arrow spaced grade titanium, and then plated in 24K gold. So there is the bumper right there. Now, if you're not using it I guess you could put it in this wonderful case Now you're looking at it, wondering, what's with this? what's this extra piece ? okay, so, the way this works is a friction fit, so it doesn't really affect your device at all These little liners protect the device from getting scratched or anything so you're getting a snug fit The titanium gold plated piece slides on afterwards. Now I'm noticing here that I've got number 24 out of a 100. And then on this side you can see it says \"Grade 5 titanium\", a high end grade, arrow space grade, this brings you back when I was investigating aluminum on the iPhone 6 that bent and then the difference between it and the 6s And I got into the whole world of aluminum grades, so anyway yes, there are different grades, different metals, you've got grade 5 titanium in this bumper. Alright so , I do have an iPhone, and I've got the matte black version here. So we're gonna put the liner pieces on first Just line those up, like this and then grab the correct bumper piece and once you slowly slide that on and there you go. It kinda reminds me of a stealth bomber The way they have those edges coming through there Just like that My friends You now have a very special iPhone 7 Plus and no one's going to mistake their iPhone for your iPhone one you've got this on there Oh My Goodness! and it's going to give it some protection as well as I said Titanium is grade 5 It should be stronger than many other metals Now you still have access to all your other buttons Actually the lock switch feels pretty nice in there You gotta nice little groove to hold on to Maybe thats where your supposed to hold it you put the thumb right up on there I don't know, like, let's be honest this is a, it's a statement it's not practical A 1000 dollar case is not practical This ain't about practicality You talking about practice You know where that's from, Jack? That might be my first Allen Iverson reference ever on Unbox Therapy This is for people, who have everything And want more and are running out of things to spend money on. If you wanna stand out, If you want people to know that you are ballin' outta control, Then Gray has you covered. You just won the game the Game of Life.",

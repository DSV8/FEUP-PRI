The Second Channel Video:   Technology Connections on Twitter:   The TC Subreddit   Normally, I put a list of people here who support me on Patreon. For almost as long as I've had the page, there hasn't been enough room to fit everyone, so only some people appeared, and on a rotating basis.  While I still can't fit you all here, this video is dedicated to all of the amazing folks around the globe who are supporting the channel. Thank you for your tremendous support, and for making the new Headquarters a reality!  If you'd like to join them, click here. And thank you for your consideration!",

    "transcript": "Be careful what you wish for This video will cover a lot of ground fairly quickly. There will be some announcements, some more announcements, and finally, some announcements. First, as Im sure youve gathered from the thumbnail my wish for a general purpose E-ink display had already been granted. Sort of. On one of my strolls through the comments section, I noticed a few people bringing up one of two devices. And, because I lack self control, I purchased this one. This is a Boox Max2, from Onyx. It is, to the average person, an e-reader with a very large display. In fact, one would probably call it an overpriced e-reader, an assessment Id agree with were it not for some of the competition its up against. Otherwise, yes. This device is known mostly for its 13.3 inch E-Ink Carta display, and for its Wacom digitizer and stylus, allowing for either a high-quality note-taking experience, or some hard core doodling. But, there are two specific features of this device which I find quite interesting. First, is the simple fact that it isnt just running some weird e-reader specific software. No no, this is running Android Marshmallow. Now, thats not great given how long ago Marshmallow came out, but most apps will still work with it. The other signature feature of the device is the fact that it can, indeed, function as an external monitor over HDMI. Now, having learned these two things, and having expressed interest in a productivity device that didnt glow in my face at night, I decided that by golly I was going to get one. And of course, I have one right here! You saw it before! *sigh* you have to think through this stuff... Now Im not going to talk about this device much here, aside from say that you almost certainly should not buy this; instead Im going to make a series of videos on my second channel, Technology Connections 2. Over there, Ill introduce the device, give you a tour and maybe mini-review, and demonstrate its many, many faults. Again, to the average person; do not buy this. What I want to do here is chronicle how Im using this, and see if it helps with my sleep. Ive been struggling with waking up later than I want to, and while I dont often seem to have trouble falling asleep, it may be that the stimulation from screens late at night is doing more harm than I realize. Its also possible that Ive simply been desensitized to light as a stimulus, and the light from the rising sun simply isnt enough to get my body stirring. Or it could be my problems are completely unrelated to screen time. But Im willing to take the time to figure it out, and I hope youll join me along the way. If this ends up radically changing my sleep-wake cycle, then you can bet Ill renew my push for reflective display technology. Ive put a link to the introductory video of this device in the description, so be sure to check it out and subscribe to the second channel if youd like to see more of it. And speaking of the second channel, while not a whole lot of stuff goes on over there right now, I am working on changing that. Ive never considered myself much of a vlogger but Im hoping to make more one-off videos over there. I recently had a fun experience at my car dealer, and through yelling about it on Twitter and interacting with people across the opinion spectrum, Ive come up with some thoughts. I havent compiled those thoughts yet, but thats a bit of what Id like to do more of over there. Just talk about stuff. And thankfully, Ill soon have a little more time to do just that sort of thing. Which is a wonderful segue into my third and final announcement, and boy is this a big one. You may have heard at one time or another that I make these videos at home, and ever since I put this set together, my living and dining room have been the site of all your favorite technological shenanigans. Well, Im so very happy to announce that I wont be those rooms of my home anymore! Technology Connections has a new studio space! In fact, Im in it right now! This is the new Technology Connections Headquarters, and I have many, many people to thank for it. With the help of family and friends, the entire set was deconstructed, moved down here, rebuilt, and if I did it well enough, you might not have noticed. In fact the E-ink video was shot right here, so if you didnt notice anything strange afoot, *maniacal laughter* I just did that to be silly, but the new Headquarters has been in the works for some months now, and its finally to the point that I can use it. Here, let me show you around. This room is purpose-built for making videos. An unfinished ceiling allows me to rig lights as required, with individuals quadrants of the room being controlled by these switches. Dedicated electrical outlets for set elements allow me to control the sets lights and power with ease. And complete separation from where I live means that this room, my new workspace, wont ever take up space in my home again. And, let me show you what Im seeing. Look at all that space behind the camera! Theres room down here for so many new projects and ideas, and Im excited to start exploring them. Theres still much work to do in places that you cant see, but its ready to make new videos today. Right now. In fact, thats what Im doing right this moment! How neat! None of this would be possible without the help of many people, from close family and friends, to the people like you who watch these videos, to the amazingly generous people around the world supporting the channel through Patreon. While this means different things to each among those groups, thank you so much for your support. Thanks for believing in me and what I do. And thanks for not only making Technology Connections possible, but for making it so much better. Heres to the future! your favorite smooth jazz hit of 1992",

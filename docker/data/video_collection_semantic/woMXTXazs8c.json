    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and I wanted to update you guys on Vlog University 'cause it is gonna be here before you know it. Now if you guys don't know, I am holding a conference here in Los Angeles for you guys to learn about content creation. And I know it's called Vlog University but I don't want you to think that this is just focusing on vlogging, because it is so much more. The next 50 people who register by December 28th will be entered into a raffle to win some AirPods and also get some free vlog you swag. I feel like the world vlog sometimes has this connotation of running around filming yourself, but I think this is a vlog and to create this little vlog right here we have kind of an insane setup. We have two cameras, we have mikes, we have lighting. We have secret lights underneath here. So much goes into content creation that a lot of people have no idea about. So we wanted to have this two-day conference, basically a crash course of content creation from editing, lighting, production, marketing and everything in between of creating content for the internet. Now it can be for YouTube, it can be for Instagram. Whatever that is we wanna give you guys the tools and the resources and meet other like-minded people just like you but have no idea where to start. And if you do know where to start and if you're already a creator, there's so much more that you can learn here that it's not just for beginners. It's really exciting because we do have support from Apple so obviously I am a huge Final Cut editor, so we'll be having a bunch of Final Cut classes. I also did a Final Cut tutorial. If you guys have never seen that, I will also put a link in the description. But the guys from Ribble Training who worked with me on that tutorial will also be here. So the people that we have teaching these courses are not just people who just started editing yesterday, they have been doing this for a really long time so I cannot wait for you guys to learn from some of the best people in the industry. Not only will we be having a lot of these great speakers but I will be there. I will be holding a bunch of sessions. I'll be leading panels, and I'll be around those two days to meet you guys, hang out, say hi, take pictures. But mostly I don't want this to be just sort of a meet and greet type thing. I want you guys to come here and meet me, meet other people who are doing the same thing as you. I really want you guys to leave this two-day conference with the knowledge to create. And if you're already creating, I want you to be able to take what you're doing and up that so that you can start creating even more high quality content. There were a bunch of questions since my last video so I wanna make sure that I answer all of those. A lot of you were asking how old do you have to be? It is an 18 and over conference, but if you are 14 or older, you are able to attend but you'll need a chaperone who is at least 18 years old and you'll have to sign a waiver. For more information and anything else that I didn't cover, check out the link in the description and there's also a little Contact Us button. You can ask the team here any questions that you guys have regarding the conference so don't be afraid to reach out if there's something that we can help you with. They've updated FAQs so hopefully any of the questions that you guys have been asking may be on the website. There's also recording options so if you guys don't happen to be in this area and not able to travel for the event, there will be a recording option where you can buy all of the recordings of everything that has happened at the conference. If this is something that you're really serious about and there's other sessions that you won't be able to make it to, with this recording option you'll be able to have a recording of all of the sessions over those two days. We've also now added a payment plan option so I know the tickets are a little expensive so if this is something that you are looking forward to and wanted to attend but didn't wanna pay for it all up front, we do have that option now added to the website. We'll have a really fun Expo Night so we're gonna have a bunch of really fun sponsors. So during Expo Night I'll be hanging out there. A bunch of the sponsors will be and all of the other attendees. So it'll be a really great place where you guys can all hang out. Meet other people who will be here for Vlog University. I'm just mostly excited about all of these sessions because there's a lot of really great sessions and some of them are not entirely flushed out yet and we're still working on the schedule. We'll have some surprise guest speakers which won't be a surprise when we announce them but right now we're still working on all of that stuff. We're still about a month-ish out, I can't believe how soon it's gonna be here. But I know it's gonna be so much fun and I can't wait to see all of you guys there. Again our holiday promo is GIFT20 so if you guys use that anytime in December you'll get 20% off your ticket price. So make sure when you go to check out you use that code so you'll get a discount. Well thank you guys for watching this quick update video. I am so excited, I have a bunch more videos coming up very shortly and if there's any other sessions that you'd be interested in seeing at Vlog University, leave those in the comments below and I hope to see you guys there. Also be sure to follow our Instagram, Vlog University, and we are also on Twitter @vloguniversity. I will see you guys in my next video. I cannot wait for this conference. It's gonna be so much fun and I cannot wait to teach you guys some of the things that I've learned over the course of 13-plus years of making videos on YouTube. (casual uplifting music)",

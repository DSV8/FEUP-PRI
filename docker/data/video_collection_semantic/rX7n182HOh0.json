    "description": "The Blue Satellite Headphones dont just stand out thanks to their striking looks. With an onboard analog amplifier, dual drivers per earcup and one of the most well-known brand names in audio, the Blue Satellite should have been a shoe-in for first place in my ever-rotating collection of bluetooth headphones.  But after a month of using Blue Satellite in the real world, I'm looking forward to reverting to my old reliable Bose QC35s. Maybe thats because Im not really an audiophile  or maybe its because I think $399 is a steep price for a headset that doesnt even give you the courtesy of a warning beep before its battery dies. As usual, the truth is probably somewhere in between. Check out my Blue Satellite review for the full story!   [SUBSCRIBE]     [PRODUCTS IN THIS VIDEO]  Blue Satellite Headphones:    [ABOUT THE BLUE SATELLITE HEADPHONES REVIEW]  MrMobile's Blue Satellite Headphones Review was produced following over 30 days with a Blue Satellite review device on loan from Blue. The headphones were tested with an LG V30, Galaxy Note 8 and MacBook Pro Retina 15.

    "transcript": "- If you've ever been in a home podcasting studio odds are you've laid eyes on the Blue Yeti, one of the most popular usb microphones there is. I used a Yeti for years, so when I heard that Blue had developed a pair of noise canceling Bluetooth headphones with a built in amplifier, I had to give them a try. What I found was a headset with some legitimate goodies for audiophiles but which misses more than it hits in the basics department. I'm Mr Mobile and this is the Blue Satellite review. Physically, the satellite headphones carry over a lot of DNA from the Blue Yeti. That is, they're huge and they're heavy. If what you want is a super portable headset for your commute, well, this isn't it. While the headphones are foldable, and they come in a really nice case, putting them on your head feels kinda like donning a helmet thanks to the bulky construction and the cups stick out far enough from your ears to make your head a lot wider thank your use to. \"Ow\" Now there's good reason for that. In addition to the built in amplifier, satellite features two drivers per ear cup and a big old battery to power them. It's 1100 mAh capacity is about double that of the Bose QC35's, but don't go thinking that means double the effective endurance. While Blue says these are good for 24 hours of playback, that's only with noise canceling and the on board amplifier turned off. Turn'em on and you only get about 8 hours between charges. A figure I verified over about a month of testing. Nevertheless, people who value sound quality above all will appreciate the Satellite. As an admitted non-audiophile, even I could appreciate the added texture the analog amp brought to music, not to mention the added volume. It's that amplifier that really sets these apart from other Bluetooth headphones. If rich dynamic sound with a broad stereo image is what you're after, these deliver. The acoustic noise canceling doesn't do as complete a job at wiping out background noises as Bose or Sony can, but Blue says that's intentional. The company didn't want to risk drowning out elements of the music itself which it claims other headphones do. At any rate, the ANC combined with the passive cancellation of these big thick air pads, makes for isolation that's just fine. And if you run out of battery power or just wanna go wired Blue includes a very long 3 meter cord. The company says it's meant for more convenience when plugging into home theater or stereo systems. Just be advised, if you use it on a plane or a train you will get it caught in the arm rest or you will trip over it. Don't say I didn't warn you. If Blue nailed all the other basics of wireless headphones, I'd probably recommend these. But Satellite gets a lot of little things wrong. The power button has almost no physical feedback and it's very hard to press. Feedback is also mushy on the volume and ANC and Bluetooth buttons. And yeah, if you think that's a lot of keys your right, they're also not distinctive enough to reliably find by feel and there's no voice feedback to tell you when certain features are enabled. Yeah there are status lights on the thing but, you're using these controls most often while you're wearing the headphones. You don't even get a low battery notification, not even so much as a beep when the power is running down. You'll just be listening to your music one second and the next, poof, silence. Frankly, that's bush league stuff when you're talking about a $400 accessory. For that price I'd rather pick up the MDR-1000X from Sony, which delivers a better experience at almost every turn. It's pretty obvious that Blue is more closely targeting acoustic appreciate-rs than those who value mobility. And, if the special sound of an analog amp is what you're really after, then yeah, these will hit the spot. But to me, what makes a product great is when that something special has an underpinning of solid fundamentals. And the satellite just gets too many of those wrong for me to recommend it to all but the most die hard audiophiles.

Until next time, thanks for watching and stay mobile my friends.",

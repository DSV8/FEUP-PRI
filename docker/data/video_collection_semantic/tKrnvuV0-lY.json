    "transcript": "- Hello, and welcome to This Is, Austin. I'm about to flex all over you because I have a 3080. - Are you mining right now? Are you a millionaire? A Bitcoin millionaire. - I will be in about nine years when I recouped my investment. - [Austin] (laughing) So what we have here today is the new Razor Blade 15. I think this, their naming structure has gotten really bad. - It's the new advanced - It's the new advanced - 2021 edition - Yeah it's, it's here's the - Go to Razer.com, build the expensive one. This is it. - Yeah. - So this is a 3080 model of the Razor Blade 15. It just came out. - [Austin] Clearly. It is difficult to get your hands on anything RTX 30 series right now. But the fact is Razor is now selling this model. I will preface this video by saying, I have not touched it. Okay. Now I've touched it. This is all a Matt production. So Matt, fill me in what do I need to know about the Blade 15? I've used these in the past. We've done videos on them in the past. What's new about this model? Is it just a graphics card? - [Matt] Not just a graphics card but that is by far the biggest upgrade. - [Austin] Same design, right? - [Matt] It's a Razor product. It's going to be, for the like on the surface almost identical to any other Razor product. It is slightly thinner. - So I think one of the things that razor has always done really well with their gaming laptops is delivering a very sort of MacBook, like form factor, - [Matt] Yes - [Austin] right? And I think there's a lot of reasons for this. We've talked about this in previous videos. Razor goes through a lot of time and expense to basically make these chassis out of a single billet of aluminum just like Apple does, do the amortization finish which is very expensive. It's a big reason why regional laptops typically cost more because just making this metal chassis is I don't know what the actual price but I will guarantee you is a lot more expensive than pretty much any other company. Who's just, you know, putting a couple of a couple of components together and calling it a day. - And I have loved that. I mean- - [Austin] Me too. I, I've, I've said that MacBook's are my favorite laptops. That's no secret. My favorite windows, laptops have always been Razors. I was a big fan of the Razor Blade Stealth. I switched over to that for a long time. - [Austin] Same, same. - This, you know, feels good, - [Austin] Whoo - but this is also the first time where I think that, that process and this chassis doesn't work. I had trouble using this as a laptop. - [Austin] Whoo hoo - And that like this, this pains me. Because again, this is like about as powerful as a laptop as you can possibly get right now. - Okay - And so it's like, awesome! Like I can do everything! I'm going to spoil the whole thing here and say, I think that a 3080 might actually be too powerful. I, I real, bear with me guys. Bear with me guys. - Too powerful - I think a 3080 is too powerful for a laptop in this form factor because this thing got so hot that it's actually painful for me to use it on my lap. - So this is a thing, right? Gaming laptops are always a little bit of an odd thing for people to buy because generally speaking, you're spending a premium although I will say maybe not at the moment given how expensive it is to build yourself a desktop but traditionally you pay more money for the portability. You're usually giving up some performance, but in return you're getting something that you can actually pick up take with you, toss in your backpack game on the go you get eight hours or whatever. I don't know the number on this but you'll get your hours of regular battery life. But as soon as you start gaming you go from pulling five, 10 Watts, 15 Watts up to a hundred, 120 Watts plus and any battery. I don't care. What kind of gaming laptop you have. You can have a hundred watt maximum, which is the largest that you can actually get on a plane with. Right? No laptops, As far as I know, it really has a larger battery than that. And even a hundred watt hour battery is not going to last more than an hour, hour and a half maybe two hours if you're not playing the super taxing game. Right? So the, the trade-off is always there but you're saying it's less about the battery life. It's more about the actual thermals of the laptop? - I, so one thing I have left on here specifically. - [Austin] Okay. - [Matt] You notice these attractive smudges. - [Austin] Yeah, yeah. Where your palms, were left - [Matt] Yeah. - [Austin] Okay. - [Matt] That's from an hour and a half of use. - Oh - That is sweat. - (laughing) Got him! - Okay, Matt. Fine. You got me to touch your sweaty laptop. Oh no, now you're going to actually clean it off. - (laughing) - That's at a point to the video you're just being a - (beep) right now man. - [Matt] Look, I know that, I know that it's a 3080 is going to get hot. - [Austin] Yeah - [Matt] Like I'm not, I'm not saying it shouldn't get hot. I so I again. I was playing Warcraft. You know, that's my game of choice, - [Austin] Which is not an incredibly demanding game - [Matt] And it looked great. It ran great. But again, after about 45 minutes of playing with this I had, I had like a laptop, like couch cushion thing. - Okay - Which is like actually a flat surface. It does give some room for, for ventilation but I could no longer rest my hands on this because - So that so - it was so uncomfortable. - That's super Interesting. Now we've not taken apart this laptop. And again, I have not touched it before we hit the record button for this video. Traditionally, if you take a look like a thermal camera, something, a laptop basically pull air in from the sides and it will exhaust it out the top. Right? Typically the bottom area which is where your hands are touching primarily it's usually battery, right? It's not typically. Oh - So there's - Okay yeah. There's your out. Your there's your exhaust right there. - [Austin] I'm curious though, your performance. So this is at a production model? - This is, this is a full retail model. - Okay. - Yeah. - So I'm curious as far as how a laptop like this is going to perform, because one of the things that if you go to Razor.com and you build, well actually pretty much any other Blades, but specifically with this model they only really ever give you one CPU option which in this case, it's a 10875h, eight core. Totally fine. - [Matt] Is the, is the case for this? And we were just talking about this prior to filming. I was personally, I when I was looking up all the different skews, I was personally overwhelmed with how many options there are. But the difference between those options is so minimal because most of them are one terabyte 32 gigabyte of RAM configurations. Where really the only difference is, the screen or and the GPU. - But if we slide this off to the side for one second And I bring in the laptop that I've been using recently which is of course the Asus Zephyrus G14. Now this is a laptop, which is a lower class, right? So this is $1,500. Instead of having a core I7, it has a Ryzen nine processor, which is actually a more power efficient chip. It's closer to a 35 watt TDP as opposed to 45 on that. But also has an RTX, 3060 instead of 3080 which I know you will certainly have more performance than me, but the difference here is that this is well yes slightly thicker, but it has some pretty trick stuff. Like when you actually pick it up, it has the little, - [Matt] The extra cooling yeah. - Okay. So we are currently running through, 3D Mark Time Spy by a very graphically demanding benchmark. We'll get the score in a second. But my first question is how hot is it really? Ooh. - [Matt] Like. - [Austin] Whew, that dude that is very warm. - [Matt] And this is like, like I was saying, not even close to what I was feeling. - Oh, wow. That's actually hot. - Yeah. Like up here is so I was feeling like this. - [Austin] Yeah - [Matt] Here. - [Austin] This benchmark has been running to be fair for like five minutes maybe right now, we ran a few CPU things before that. Okay. 100% by it that it is very warm look, gaming, laptops get hot. But that actually is, that's a bit much - And all right here. Like I don't like, I don't want to make it sound like I'm just completely trashing this laptop because this is an amazing laptop. It really is. But it comes down to what are you trading off for to get a 3080 in here? And first things first is, you know you always got the biggest [beep] brick here which is also hot, after using this for an hour and a half. I didn't want to use this as a laptop. - [Austin] Yeah Like it's one thing to be like, I'm going to game on this all the time and I can always have it on a desk and I can always have a mouse. I can always have a keyboard. But when like, again, when we're talking about a laptop a portable device, this does not scream portable to me. So let's talk about the, the benchmark scores. So I, let me preface everything. I stand by what I said in the last video. If you want to, to buy desktop components don't buy a laptop and dock it. It's hard to recommend this one even with a 3080, please take it away. - [Austin] Okay, so Time Spy 8,600, the 3060 and this system got 7290, right? That is a fairly small difference going from a 20, 3060 to a 3080. Is this an especially small difference considering that this laptop costs almost double the G14 and to sort of put a little finer point on it it's a bigger laptop, right? The smaller system you would expect to throttle more on top of all of that this Ryzen 9 has absolutely wiped the floor with that. When you look at the CPU's scores on Cinebench, right? Single core, multi-core doesn't matter. The Ryzen has absolutely crushed it. Grain of salt alert. We've not had more time with this. We've just done a benchmark live here. So, you know, it is what it is. Looking through here, I mean, you see the CPU throttles down 2.8 gigahertz but that GPU look at that, the GPU is like doing okay, like 12, 13, 14. But as the later we get into the run, I mean it really clocks down to what I assume was whatever the TDB max is. If you want to go buy a Razor Blade by all means, go ahead. I don't think the 3080 makes sense the sacrifice you have to make, like save your money and get a 3070 Save your money get a 3060 and you're going to save several hundred dollars and probably not lose that much performance because you're limited by the thermal constraints of the system, more so than the actual silicon inside. - And, and I do think it makes a lot more sense, to do like a 3060, or even a 3070 in this laptop because the Blade is still a really good chassis where everything is in, one thing that I really like about it. It's got a full-size SD card slot on the, on the side here. It's got thunder bolt, it's got three USB A's. It's got a full size HDMI, it has a webcam, which is super important - [Austin] G14, doesn't. - Correct. So like, and it's, it's like, I mean I don't think the webcam is anything like crazy, but it's still pretty decent. - It exists and also gives you windows to low support. - Yes. - Which is nice. - Again, I think, I think it's just too much power for a chassis like this. - I think they've made a couple of key mistakes here, first and foremost Intel is not the way to go in laptop CPU's in 2021, the Ryzen chip is more powerful, more power efficient, quieter, cooler, et cetera, et cetera. It checks all the boxes, right? That is a better CPU in this system. Sure. The optimist solution it's probably gonna be a little bit better at jumping back and forth between dedicate graphics and stuff. Yeah. But guess what this does as well. And it has better integrated graphics to boot, putting a 3080 in a laptop like this, is great to get that number on the box but you were paying several hundred dollars more compared to the 3070 it's two or $300 more. And it, you're not getting two or $300 more performance right? - [Matt] No. - You're just you're simply limited by the thermal constraints of the laptop. I think while yes, you're paying a premium for the design and everything like that. And the screen is really, really excellent. It's a tough sell, right? If you get one of the mid range Blade's it's probably gonna be a better overall package. But for me as someone who admittedly does prefer a slightly smaller laptop, this G14, or if you want 15 inch, the G15 which is just a slightly larger version of this laptop has a lot of the same features seems like a cheaper and more powerful option. At least when you look at the bang for the buck, right? - [Matt] Right, and so like part of it is just it came down to, for me, I like, again I don't want to use this as a, a daily laptop just because it's, it's the weight, the bulk I didn't this is the first time I didn't love the keyboard. I'm again, I'm someone who likes the Apple keyboard. I do actually like the Zephyrus keyboard. - [Austin] Same. - [Matt] I just hate the way that it looks but that's just, that's vanity - Fair. It's weird. It's hard to say that the Razor Blade is too big and bulky because that is one of the smallest 15 inch laptops you can get. - [Matt] Right. - I just look man. - It's when it's when something like that. - Yeah. - Like that to me is, is the compromise coming from a a 13 inch MacBook Air that doesn't seem like as big of a jump. I mean, it's not as big of a jump, but like, again, if we're not if we're only going to be getting a small performance jump from compared to, from this, to this I'm going to go with that every time. - Yeah. half the price better performance in CPU almost as good in GPU. - This is where I think the chassis just doesn't make sense. And so they did say that's a little bit thinner but I mean. - [Austin] I don't want it to be thinner, I want it to be thicker, that where it actually can handle the heat. I want it to not feel incredibly warm, also I don't know what's going on to be fair. This one seems to be a little bit odd. The thermal, like it was running some of those benchmarks with the fan quiet. It's been sitting here doing nothing for the last five minutes and the fan is louder than it was when we were benchmarking. Because I don't get what. - Yeah it's just nothing. Nothing is running. - Yeah. - I mean, again, we'll be fair. This is one of the very first one off the production line. - But it is a real production model. - Yeah. So. - At this point, I think it is pretty clear that while the Blade is a well-built and generally speaking good laptop when it comes to gaming PC's I don't think there's a ton of argument to be going for an Intel laptop right now. - [Matt] No. And certainly not one that is this expensive when something like the Zephyrus G14, or G15 exists with better processors, essentially the same if not slightly better performance and significantly lower price tags but let us know what you think in the comments below.

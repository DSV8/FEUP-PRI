    "transcript": "Hacking is the most important skill set of the 21st century. It's influencing geopolitics it's influencing, Cyber War, it's influencing cyber criminals, it's influencing Espionage. I mean you can just keep on going on and on and on. The guy who knows Linux in that in that particular institution is always the one that there's the go-to guy like oh he this is the guy who knows Linux. It shouldn't be a rare skill but in some offices it is and it'll assure your employment forever. I'm just going to say this OccupyTheWeb what I really like about the way you teach this stuff is you teach it from a practical point of view rather than just someone saying here's Tail. Well thank you yeah I mean it this is where most people are going to use Tail is re log files so if you're in cyber security you got to keep track of those those log file you got to see what's happening on your system. Hey everyone it's David Bombal back with OccupyTheWeb, OccupyTheWeb welcome. Thanks David it's always an honor to be back on the best IT and cyber security channel on YouTube and before we start I want to congratulate you on hitting 2 million subscribers good job man that's that's quite an honor to be able to hit 2 million subscribers so. I really appreciate it and you know thanks so much for joining me on this journey so many positive comments about the content that we create together and that is what I really want to announce for everyone so we started our series last time where we spoke about Linux Basics for Hackers and OccupyTheWeb has agreed to continue the series so this is his book if you want to read it see these videos as a companion guide and sort of an update to some of the information in the book OccupyTheWeb is addressing a whole bunch of things so you know go and buy the book follow along on the videos or with the videos. OccupyTheWeb I always enjoy talking to you because I always like to say you know you wrote this book as well Network Basics for Hackers you approach this kind of stuff from a hacker mindset and you've also got this book Getting Started Becoming a Master Hacker. You got to remind me again are your books still killing it on Amazon right? They are both doing well on Amazon, The Getting Started Becoming Master Hacker uh has been the number one selling book on Amazon in last week and The Network Basics for Hackers was the number one hacking book on Amazon so it's they're both selling pretty well I'm pleased to say and of course the Linux Basics for Hackers even though it's five years old is still the best selling Linux book on Amazon and other places so I'm happy to see that and I want to thank everybody for you know buying the books and uh supporting this effort to bring cyber security training to everybody so that all having been said let's talk a little bit about Linux here. One of the things that makes Linux different than say Windows is that Linux was designed so that all the configuration that takes place in Linux is done via text files okay everything's a file and configuration is all done through text files so unlike Windows when you want to configure something you have to do a plugin MMC what have you and then go click click click click click click click click click click click click click to be able to configure something in Windows. In Linux it's really much simpler is that all you need to do is to go to the configuration file and the configuration files are almost always in /etc okay in /etc directory and then you open up that file in a text editor and it you know we could go into you know VI or Vim or any of the others of the text letters but you don't you you can use a simple graphical text editor like what's built into Kali right now is mousepad and open up the file, edit the file, save it, and then you're done configuring. That's how configuration is done in Linux so if we just quickly go to the /etc directory and go ls -l now mine might be a little bit different than yours because I've got stuff that you probably don't have but these are almost all you can see these are conf files in each one of these like here's SQL map and if I go to that directory I'll find a conf file, here's another conf file these are all configuration files. So these configuration files are they determine how the application actually works and so in the book I used Snort. Snort is um is a IDS or a Network Intrusion Detection System that used to be built into Kali by default but in recent years Kali has taken it out uh of both the default installation and they've taken it out of the repository as well and so I get people constantly writing me like every day about I can't I can't install Snort okay so in the book I tell you to go ahead and go let me clear my screen and then I'm going togo back a level cd .. takes me back one level in my directory structure and then notice that I'm at the very top of the file system at the root. Let's go to my home directory I can use the tilde cd to the tilde and that'll take me now go pwd it takes me to my home in Kali. The tilde represents my home directory of the user that I'm in here okay so I can shortcut is simply go cd ~ and that takes me to my home directory. Now normally to get Snort we'd go sudo apt install I think in the book I use apt-get let's just talk about that okay. You got to get people upset if you use apt-get sorry go. Yeah well apt-get was the older command now we're just using apt all right so in the book I use apt-get but you can use apt these both of them work right so apt is just a little newer so aptinstall snort it's going to ask me for my Kali my password notice that I use sudo I don't use sudo in the book because it wasn't required back in the older Kali's sudo gives me root privileges for that single command I put in my password and it goes through and it tells me snort is already the newest version 2.9.15.1-5 okay I've already have it installed here there's actually a newer version of Snort that's out it's 3.0 and but this one works great and that's what we're going to be working with for those of you who are getting a message that says snort is not available package not found let me show you what to do. So what we need to do is we're going to go sudo mousepad /etc/apt/sources.list okay what this should be plural sources what this is is open it up and you'll see this is a uh configuration file okay essentially for the app to where apt APT where it goes to look for packages yours okay you see I've got quite a few of I've got some parrot nice I got some parrot repositories down here okay so normally what happens is that when you have your um Kali you're going to have this line right here or something very similar to it what I've done is that I I have added some other sources let's see this is one right here okay let's go ahead and this is the Debian. What did you do with the hashtag? Oh the hash is a comment okay so it's commenting it out okay these are when you see these hashes here that means it's commented out all right so I've commented for for whatever reason I've commented out some of these here uh in some cases they'll throw error messages if the pocket isn't available what have you so what what I want you to do everybody if you want to use Snort on your system is go ahead and add that line to this file okay this is simply the FTP Debian repository and then go ahead and save it and now when you do the apt install it'll find Snort for you and it'll install 2.9.15 okay that's the version that we want and let me go ahead and close this mousepad if that doesn't work for you and there's a possibility that it doesn't I've heard from a few people for whatever reason it hasn't worked for them. There's another thing that you can do to follow along in these exercises and let's let's do that let's go ahead and look at mousepad and let's go sudo mousepad sudo mousepad and just go to /etc/apache so in Chapter two we're just what I'm trying to show here is how you can use some basic text manipulation on configuration file it doesn't matter if it's it doesn't matter if it's Snort or if it's Apache it just we're just trying to learn some basic skills of how to manage these files and so let's go ahead and open up this and you can see here that I have the Apache 2 configuration file so if for whatever reason and you're going through the book and you can't get Snort installed on your system um use this use use the Apache 2 we're trying to demonstrate a a fundamental skill set doesn't matter what file that you use so um Snort I use Snort simply because it is a cyber security tool right it's been around for over 20 years it's an excellent piece of software it's now owned by Cisco and uh yeah it's it's an idea so it's designed to detect incursions that's what it's that's what it's been put together for and it's been around I think since 98 if I remember correctly so it's been around quite a while. So in the book we go ahead and we're going to look at I'm going to go ahead and do these with the configuration file for Snort but if you don't have Snort you can't get Snort feel free to just go ahead and do everything I'm doing with Apache2.com the file I just showed you okay. So let's let's go I like Snort it's good tool let's take a look at it let's go cat we can do that and /etc that's where the configuration files are then the directory is /snort okay the subd directory snort and then there's a file called snort confokay. Just just cuz I'm slow you saying that if that doesn't work because I don't have Snort then I should just do exactly the same thing but just substitute the Snort command with like Apache right that's what you were saying right? Exactly go use the Apache. It comes back and tells me you your permission is denied there we go okay and so when I use the sudo I get it's not it says basically when it comes back this permission denied you know then that means you need to use sudo sometimes you'll try to open up or run a command and it'll say it can't find it sometimes it it tries sudo okay sometimes it'll find it if you're using the root user. So here we go here's the file we just catted it okay cat is a real Simple Text display command and what cat does is it just takes the entire file and displays it on your screen that that's okay for small files but for big files it it doesn't work very well all right so we're going to look at other ways that we can go ahead and view the contents of the file that are more useful have you know greater practical uses for us one of those is simply to use the the command head okay and same file okay oh I should tap let me tap uh snort conf all right I I end up type let's go ahead and permission deny it again so you know don't don't fret just go ahead and put in the sudo all right and what this will do his head will now give me the first I think the default is 10 lines all right the first 10 lines 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 yeah it gives me the first 10 lines by default but if I needed more than 10 lines I could easily just tell it to give me more I can say give me the first 20 lines let's and it'll go ahead and give me the first 20 lines or 100 lines or 92 lines all right whatever whatever the amount of lines that you want okay. So this get me the first 10 lines or whatever specified number I want but I can also look at the bottom of the file okay sometimes I want to see the bottom of the file because some files like log files, log files are always being appended, they're being appended they're being added to at the bottom of the file. So the top of the file is old stuff the bottom of the file is the new stuff, that's the stuff I'm interested in seeing so in that case I can go ahead and use the keyword I'm going to go sudotail okay. I'm just going to say this OccupyTheWeb what I really like about the way you teach this stuff and I think you know the viewers agree with us is you teach it from a practical point of view rather than just someone saying yes tail gives us the last 10 lines you've actually given us a really good example of why you'd use it so thanks. Well thank you yeah I mean it this is where most people are going to use tail is reading log files so if you're in you know cyber security you got to keep track of those those log files you got to see what's happening on your system and so this is a way that we can use this go look at the last 10 lines to see what's happened in your log files and in the case of Snort there's our our last 10 lines. When we get into looking at the logs I don't know what chapter we I actually have a chapter on logs in logging systems chapter 11 so we'll get into that. We'll look we use the tail command for checking the logs but here we're just going to stay with our Snort or Apache 2 if that's what you're using that's fine you don't need to be Snort it doesn't really matter what what file you're using I'm trying to teach fundamentals of how to find with view the files, we use tail and it's default is 10 lines we can obviously just like with head we can go ahead and use 20 and it show us the last 20 lines of the snort configuration file. We can also often times we want to go ahead and see the file with line numbers on it and so we can do that by going nl okay and same thing /etc/snort/snort.conf like that and now it gives us line numbers right so we can go ahead and find exactly what line we want to see right and uh and go back if we need to edit it we know what line to go back to. One of the things that is probably one of the most fundamental skills in Linux is using grep to find the material that you're looking for. In in the snort file there's a section called the output and if we were to scroll up through all these 600 lines we would find that there's an output section and that section is one that if you're really going to use it in a commercial environment you need to configure and that's why I use it as an example because that's where you're going to need to to work at in snort to get it set up in your commercial environment so let's go ahead and do the same thing let's use let's use our cat instead of nl we could use nl as well and then what we can do with this is that we can go and and filter it so the this is a pipe right here pipe says send the output of this command the output of this command to a new command and that new command is going to be grep, grep is a filter and then say we're looking for the output section of the snort configuration file it'll do is it'll go ahead through each line and look for the word output and if it finds that word it'll display it on the screen for me. Let's do that there we go and puts it in red even easier all right so it's showing me all of the output lines these are where I determine in Snort where the alerts or the logs are going to go to you can see here here's the alert_unified, alert_unified2 there's several these it's sending in this case is sending out to the snort log, here sending out to the merged log, you can see that this one one is actually commented out and this is the default it's sending out your uh logs to snort log all right this is one of the key components of setting up your snort to be functional in a commercial environment wherever you know whatever a production environment rather than a commercial en because it might not be commercial and a production environment you got to tell it where are you going to send the data to the the data about malicious activity and this is the section. Sorry so I'll just try and ask the questions that I'm assuming a lot of people are going to ask after your cat you've got two spaces does spacing matter because it seemed to work without a problem right? Yeah it's I could take that's just my poor typing skills but uh I. Just you know some people might be used to like some programming language like Python or whatever might be you know spaces are important or some other languages. Exactly in Python that indentation becomes crucial right and so here it it's not really in this is our bash show okay it doesn't really make a whole lot of difference you know thinking about uh this being a bash shell there's one of the things that has happened with the 2023 is that they've switched it over to a Z shell okay so if you're using a brand new version of uh Kali you're going to be working in a Z shel which is the same shell this is this is essentially a shell here the same shell that a Mac OS uses most distributions of Linux and Unix use a bash shell you know I I don't want to fight the tide but I like the bash shell and and I would say 95% of people who work in Linux like the bash shell and prefer the bash shell. One of the things that in the newer versions and this is an older version all right there's a a command called Kali tweaks let's see if it works this is a 2022 version okay there it is Kali tweaks okay so this is one of the things that that is not in my book because it wasn't there back then we can tell Kali what shell and prompt among other things you see there's Network Repositories right here, there's Metapackages here and you know that's all good but that's beyond what we're doing right now we're just in the chapter two of our book. So shell configure the shell and command prompt I'm going to hit enter and it says configure the default login shell right here set the default login show and those the two choices I can either choose the bash or the Z Shell and I would suggest switching to the bash shell. Especially when they're following our videos right yeah right especially following this videos because some of the things in the Z Shell are not exactly the same most of it's the same but some of the things are not and that's going to cause some things to break for you if a few things to break for you they're going to maybe be frustrating to a beginner. The other reason is that if you're working out in a in a production environment most people are using the bash shell they are not using the Z Shell so I have some uh problems with offensive security switching over to the Z Shell but the beauty of what they've done is they've allowed us to switch back right so if you're using the Z Shell you can switch back to the Bourne Shell okay Bourne Again Shell and go ahead and use it which is you're going to find it on the Bourne Again Shell on Red Hat, you're going to find it on Fedora, you're going to find it on on Ubuntu, you're going to find it you know just keep on going, if you're using Solace, if you're using HP-UX, you're going to find the Bourne Shell so it's probably a good idea to work with the Bourne Shell so that you can go into other uh Linux environments or Unix environments using the default shell that everybody uses. Now as I said Apple uses the Z Shell Kali the new Kali use the Z Shell you know you might want to go ahead and use it I'm not I'm not saying that the bash shell is better what I'm saying is it's what I'm accustomed to and it's what over 90% of Linux administrators are using and maybe eventually Z Shell will become um will become the standard but right now it's you know I just kind of I use the escape key to exit the Kali tweaks so that's a that's not in the book so you know if you want to make some changes it's kind of a nice thing that they've added in the recent versions is Kali Tweaks I think it first went in in 2022 but I couldn't say that for certain I think so. So we used the grep command right and we can also oh there's you know one of the things that we can do is we can actually specify what line we want to see but that's what's probably more important is and you see that in the book on page 23 of the book is the SED command okay, SED right let's go ahead and just take a look at that command s right here's the SED command I just went ahead and entered it and SED stands for Stream Editor almost all of these commands are shortened versions of words okay stream editor is said so it's not as mysterious as it might seem and what we're going to be doing is editing a stream right that's what assum this is the help screen right there's a lot of stuff here but we're going to just be using some of the basic stuff right that we can do. Remember let's go back and use our cat all right let let's go sudo cat all right and then we're going to go /etc/snort and we're going to look at that snort.config configuration the often times most times in Linux the configuration files end in CONF but not always, sometimes you'll see CNF, sometimes you'll see them as CFG, sometimes you'll see the whole word spelled out, okay but most of them are CONF. So let's go ahead and go back to that and but let's grep looking for once again talking about the output from snort all right let me go MySQL I'm going to remind viewers that if you don't have Snort you can still do this with the Apache 2 and that works just fine. Okay so when I did the grep I can see that there's two rules okay that have MySQL in them all right and if I wanted to go ahead and change those two so there's only two places that that word shows up okay remember that in Linux everything is a everything is text text, yes they're case sensitive case sensitive so if you just if you you might want to go and take a look around and see oh maybe somebody spelled it as nope they didn't do that so you need to be able to make certain that it's not using some other um case than what you've put written it in because it won't find you if it's written like this it won't find it now that we know where MySQL is and these are actually rules that are have been written to be able to detect any kind of intrusion against a mySQL database. So snort is a signature based ideas that means that it's taken what is referred to as a signature it found a key element in the attack a unique and key element in the attack and it has taken that and built a rule looking for that from any of the packets that are coming across the stream of packets to your network right and we could go ahead and look inside these but you know that's getting into a Snort class versus simply do that simply a Linux yeah we can do a Snort class in the in the future that's what is doing here it's just going ahead and looking for Snort based attack now maybe okay we want to go ahead and edit that particular file okay and replace the lowercase MySQL was maybe an uppercase or a different a different way of expressing MySQL kind of like this here or the capital M and then that uppercase SQL the stream editor allows us to do that so I'm going to go ahead and clear my screen what this is useful for is that say you've written a script or other file even a text file okay let's say you're writing a note to somebody or a letter to somebody and you realize that you had misspelled this word over and over and over again okay and that rather than going through and finding each of them you want to change all of them at one time that's what this can do for us in any kind of text file so we're going to go ahead and we're going to edit so because that file is protected okay we need to use sudo it's protected so only the root user can use it so then we're going to go and use the said command okay and go sed and then s/ and that says go ahead and find all of the occurrences of MySQL and replace it this is what I do in the book okay so this is exactly in the book with G now if you're using the Apache you can find a different word and change it as well okay so it says go ahead and replace this word right here with this word here globally that's what a G stands for. So it's like S source and G is global right? Yes exactly S is Source G is Global and then I have to give it the file that I wanted to work on okay that's going to be we're going to give it the the the the full path right to that file which is going to be /etc/snort/snort.count make it's simple okay and then we're going to send the output and this is the output by using the the greater than sign that says take whatever I've done here and put it into a new file all right, the reason we want to make sure that we send this another file is because if we don't do that the configuration file is when you run snort is going to be looking for snort conf and these kind of changes are may not be in the best interest of your snort installation. So what we're doing here is we're getting root permissions using the stream editor using S as a source and then changing it here globally in the file so every time it sees it and we're doing it this is what we're working on and then we're sending it out to snort2.conf okay so let's go ahead and hit enter and it goes ahead and changes that now we could go ahead and go cat snort.conf now notice that this is snort2.conf this is in a different directory and there's our file right now we can go ahead and Cat and then go grep okay mysql on that same file and it comes back with nothing why because we changed every occurrence globally of my SQL. So let's go ahead and look for the way that we retyped it with the capital M and capital by the way MySQL for those who aren't familiar is an open-source database it's used in millions of applications and websites you know it it was very timely a couple of swed developers came out with it in the mid 90s and just as the internet was exploding and it was free and so it's it's behind millions and millions of websites because it was free at the right time eventually now it's owned by Oracle and those same Swed developers have come up with a alternative that's called Maria so if you're using your Kali and you're trying to use MySQL and it says Maria basically think of them as the same all right they're basically clones of each other the same developers the reason they developed new Maria was to prevent the possibility that Oracle which is a commercial company would make it not open source so they came up with and that's what Kali is using now. So anyways MySQL grep MySQL and there they are we've made those changes. Okay So this is really that's kind of like finding and replacing word or something right? yeah it's kind of like find and replacement word exactly except it's actually simpler and easier to to do with the said command it so yeah. In word you can go ahead and go find then finds each one of the occurrences and we change it same thing here. Now we've been using some pretty rudimentary file display utilities cat being one of them NL, Tail, Head okay but there are some little more sophisticated one and one of those is going to be More I'm going to go ahead and clear my screen so you can take it up to the top here more is a text display command but it's a little bit more sophisticated than Cat Let's go see try it on our snort. Again snort.conf this is the old one this is the original I didn't change the original permission denied got to go use my sudo all right there it is notice that unlike cat it didn't scroll to the very bottom of the the file what it did is it stopped as soon as it filled up the screen and then I can do enter to navigate down through the file it's a little more helpful, a little more practical than cat is okay cat, cat by the way stands for it's short for concatenate which literally is a fancy word for putting things putting words together that's what concatenate means so if you ever wondered why they called the the the editor not the editor but the display command cat it's a short for concatenate. A latinate word that means putting things together putting words together here's. You're pressing enter right so it's one line at a time? I'm I'm just pressing enter right it gives me one line at a at a time okay so I can go through my file looking for. Does Space bar work for like a whole page? Yep yeah okay great space bar okay going through it yep down. Well one of the things that we need to understand about More is to exit More we need to use the Q okay so Q takes me out all right not exit not Escape it's going to be Q now one of the things I showed you in the last class was the man page right. man aircrack-ng we use aircrack ng I think in the example by using man it's going to bring up the manual for whatever command I'm looking for but one of the things that reason I bring it up now is that the an is using More okay as its text display so it uses a Q as well all right so if you get you in this manual and you can't figure out how to get out of it know that it's simply a more command that uses the Q to exit right. Now there's kind of a an old saying in among Linux Geeks that uh less is more right because less is a another text display command that does more than more does that's that's the joke okay so if we go sudo not a very funny joke but it's a joke. Okay. One of our dad jokes sh our age. It's what it's one of those one of those Linux geek jokes that Linux Geeks would find funny but nobody else would. All right so so we're going to go sudo and we're going to go less and go /etc/snort and then snort.conf this is this is less all right? There we go. Now one of the things that makes makes it different is that at the very bottom of the screen you'll see that there's the highlighted path right here to the file okay if you press the forward key okay less will let you search all right so I hit the the forward slash and it'll let me now search. When you say forward like right arrow right? No I hit the forward slash. oh forward slash sorry sorry. Right forward slash key I'm sorry now it'll let me go ahead and search so now remember that we we knew that there's MySQL somewhere in this file so we'll allow us to go and rather than having to use grep or some other tool we can go and there it goes it finds it finds it right there in the rules and then I can keep keep on going and I found it again all right so this is this is the less command all right. So this allows us primarily to be able to uh do searches on text files to find unique strings strings are basically letters it's one of those terms that if you're not been around the IT world when people talk about strings all strings are is texts right a bunch of letters together as opposed to say special characters or numbers or binary strings are text all right so this case it allows me to search for strings or texts and when you get into certain areas of say like reverse engineering or analyzing malware strings can be useful there's a command in Linux called strings all right that allows you to pull the strings out of say a piece of malware or any piece of software all right so that's a term that you should know strings means just text all right. Then we can go ahead and use the Q and it takes me back takes me out just like more the Q does the same job of getting me out of that application this case it's less and I think with that we have just concluded chapter two. I love it I mean just at the top of this recording it was announced today that Cisco purchased Splunk I mean big moves in the industry I think you've said many times hacking is the number one skill right? Hacking is the most important skill of the 21st century at least at this end of the 21st century what are we in 2023 you know maybe in 2090 which I won't be around to see uh maybe in 2090 uh something else will have replace it but right now I would say that hacking is the most important skill set of the 21st century it's influencing geopolitics, it's influencing Cyber War, it's influencing cyber criminals, it's influencing Espionage, I mean you can just keep on going on and on and on about how important it is and most people only see hacking from the perspective of cyber crime but it's influencing everything right now and of course cyber security is the other end of being able to prevent those types of attacks or repel those attacks and at hackers arise what we try to do is that we try to develop what we call Cyber Warriors who are neither Attackers or Defenders exclusively we try to teach both offense and defense and and turn out well-rounded cyber Warriors who can both repel attacks and implement attacks initiate attacks and I firmly believe that if you want to be on the defensive side of cyber security which by the way I think Splunk is an excellent tool and it's one of the things that we teach at hackers rise we have a class on Splunk and we think Splunk I think Splunk is an excellent tool so um I'm happy to see Cisco purchase it and now Cisco has two of my favorite tools Snort and Splunk but we try to turn out well-rounded cyber Warriors who can work on both sides both offense and defense and I think that by doing that by taking that approach you're better at what you do if you can see it from both the offense and defense perspective I think that defensive cyber security defensive professionals who don't understand how to hack are going to not be as effective as they if they actually knew how to hack and same goes for offensive they you have to know what the defenses are up against that you're up against to be able to get past them so that's what that's our philosophy at hacker's rise is to turn out both with people with skills in both areas both sides of the aisle and we think that this is the most important skill set in the 21st century at least in 2023 and the first first 23 years of this century. And I love it you know the um you've said it as well you can't be a hacker without Linux and um that's why you wrote this book right and we're going to continue talking we're in Chapter 2 now I believe is that right? Yeah we're going to on chapter two yeah I firmly believe that if you're if you're not not using Linux you're not a hacker yeah and I'm surprised often times how people will object to that statement but it's true and I have no no qualms about saying it over and over again I know that there are some hacker programs out there that teach hacking without Linux but you're not a hacker when you come out of those schools if you if you're not being taught on Linux and taught using Linux I I gave a lecture at a uni major university about a year ago and I said just this and it turns out that the professor who was teaching the class taught it from Windows oh wow wow and so and so the students I'm saying this about you gotta know Linux you're not really a hacker and the students were laughing in the lecture hall because you know I can't see them but I can hear them and I'm like wonder why they're laughing and later on I learned that he had been teaching the class from a in a university a major university in US he'd been teaching hacking using Windows and that's not real that's not real okay and it's a disservice to those people those students to have him teaching from a Windows perspective because you know no hacker uses windows I could say that I could say no real hacker uses Windows so anyways let's. I'll just say this before we jump in I mean Linux is is a foundational skill for hacking just for anything really these days you have to know Linux if you want to be an IT so you know I'm I'm with you on this um I don't want to keep you back sorry go on. No I think I agree with you that no matter what you're doing is in IT that I think you need to know you need to know Linux right and and and you'll find that in the workplace that the guy who knows Linux in that in that particular institution is always the one that there's the go-to guy like oh he this is the guy who knows Linux it it shouldn't be a rare skill but in some offices it is and it'll assure your employment forever if you know Linux well because there's still not enough Linux people and no matter what you're working in if you know Linux it's going to make you more valuable to the organization so take the time learn Linux my book was designed for people who want to enter cyber security but don't have the Linux skills it was designed from my experience of teaching cyber security and hacking to people who were really smart people but had no Linux skills and so I had to start on day one of teaching them Linux and so the book grows out of that experience of training uh hackers for the military who had no Linux experience and it is clear to me from that experience that a book like this would be really useful and it's proven to be very useful and I purposely kept it small so those people who say oh you know it doesn't have much depth well it doesn't have much depth that's it's meant to boil down the essentials for you so you can read the entire book it's to make it accessible to everybody and one of the things the feedbacks I get from people like you know it's the only Linux book I ever read the entire book right exactly because all the other Linux books are like a thousand pages and they're so dense and deep and they have a lot of information but those are books that you keep on the shelf and you reference them this book is a book that you read and you go through the entire book and when you come through the entire book you'll have the fundamental skills that you need to operate in cyber security you're not going to be necessarily a Linux expert but you'll have the fundamental skills and then you can build upon that. OccupyTheWeb what I really like about what you've done here is you know we've spoken offline you can go into the depths of these tools right but you're keeping it simple? I'm trying to keep it simple that's the whole point of the book and the whole idea was to keep the book very small short and accessible so yes you can spend you know more time to get to know these commands and greater depth what I tried to do is to boil it down to the essentials of what you need to be functional in Linux. So my dad joke less is more once again right? Less is more. So for everyone who's watching you know please put your comments below stuff that you want to cover or want us to cover it's fantastic to be able to get input from OccupyTheWeb and OccupyTheWeb I I'll say this again what I really love about what you've done is you've got all this knowledge but you bring it down to our level so thanks so much for making it simple and keeping it you know short and simple I always talk about the curse of knowledge people who know a lot often forget that people who start don't and they complicated so thanks for keeping it simple. Well I enjoyed doing this and um hopefully you know some of the things that we're adding to this video help people who are reading the book where things are a little bit different than what they are in the book so hopefully this kind of brings things up to date and explains why for instance you can't do Snort because your it's not in the repository but you can add the repository in and if that doesn't work you can still just use Apache or any other file to do what we're doing to get to learn how to manipulate texts in Linux. OccupyTheWeb thanks so much I look forward to our next one we're going to continue with chapter 3 next time right? Analyzing and managing networks I'm looking forward to that one. Oh yeah that should be a good one so that's an important one for those people who are working in cyber security to be able to understand how to use Linux in a networked environment thanks for having me David see you soon. See you soon look forward to it.",

    "transcript": "well well well another AMD GPU is gonna be launched and no it's not the RX 5800 it's the RX 5500 my friends yeah let's just take a moment to appreciate the energy and the tech that goes behind manufacturers GPUs prompts to AMD man come on let's give them a round of applause you know let's let's take a moment to reflect upon AMD just do that just take a moment didn't ya just just now I know that a lot of you guys were hoping for something that would compete against the RTX 2080 TI or some other high-end GPUs from Nvidia or even the more affordable GTX 1660 series but that isn't the case with this new GPU in fact it does neither of those and if we were to expect a higher end GPU from AMD with the current shortages affecting in DSM nanometer process it would significantly take it would take us longer time for for those to even come out in the first place so there's that but before you ignore the rx 5500 just because it's a boring entry-level graphics card from AMD you need to know a few things like why we think this might be an DS or one of AMD's most important GPU launches of 2019 why it needs to succeed or how it could fail so let's take a closer look at this right after quick message from our sponsor the gamer storm castle 240 X gives you a peace of mind with anti leak tech inside by reducing pressure build-up as temperatures fluctuate Plus this one the best-looking palm designs with the removable mirror cover and swappable logo pieces with full addressable RGB support for that extra bling check it out below alright so I'm gonna start this video with a little bit of flashback basically while AMD's mid to high-end GPUs have received a regular updates over the past few years their entry-level models haven't that means a lot of the Radeon cards in pre-built desktops and notebooks are based off an architecture that's four years old even on retail shelves almost every aimed a GPU that's under $200 is an rx 500 series that's built around a forge NGC and Technology now four years might not sound like a lot but in tech terms that's a lifetime guys especially when we have Nvidia launching much more powerful and efficient GP that's relatively affordable as well so basically AMD was in desperate need of an update and that's where the RX 5500 series comes into play because it's based off the new seven nanometer rDNA architecture from a speck standpoint they're gonna be a couple of cards being offered and pricing isn't available yet even though they'll be available in October or November on the desktop site they'll be both four gigabytes and a gigabyte cards with 14 gigabits per second G DDR six which operates on a 128-bit memory bus and offers 1408 cores across 22 compute units that's a little more than half of what the rx 5700 XT has personally I think the RX 5500 M will be targeted towards slim and light notebooks and its specs are pretty similar to the desktop Varian it operates at lower clocks and has four gigabytes of memory as usual the rDNA architecture significantly improves performance while lowering power consumption and also decreasing die size honestly for desktop users these things are less of a concern but this is a huge deal for the notebook market Amy didn't really share all that much about performance but what they did show was pretty interesting these numbers are accurate then expect roughly the same frame rates as an RX 580 or something that sits between the gtx 1650 and a gtx 1660 so this actually brings me to one of the reasons why the RX 5500 might be so important for AMD right now Nvidia doesn't have anything that can directly compete against it in the desktop or notebook segments sure that might change in the next few months but the Radeon lineup desperately needed some fresh blood and affordable price points the only red flag here is that these numbers are expected performance rather than actual numbers so keep that in mind personally I think the big highlight of this launch is the RX 5500 M because right now the GTX 1650 mobile GPU offers an amazing combination of performance and efficiency for thin and light notebooks for example the new Razer Blade stealth will come with an Intel I select CPU and the option for GTX 1650 graphics the RX 5500 could give notebook manufacturers access to even more graphics horsepower in their small form-factor designs so why is the r 5500 so important for AMD well first of all a gift system builders an alternative to the GTX 1654 they're more affordable gaming rigs secondly it can be used in notebooks where GPU is like the RX 570 Rx 580 or even the 5700 series cannot be used because they simply produce way too much heat and of course consume a lot of power seriously the Radeon lineup needed newer products so that they can sell it in bigger volumes to fund future development and that's exactly what's happening here it actually allows notebook manufacturers like MSI to come up with designs like this the Alpha 15 which is a 15-inch thin and light gaming notebook it has a 37 50 H CPU the RX 5500 144 Hertz freesync display and more which is exactly what we would want from an all AMD gaming notebook that's a big step away from something like the cheap-looking FX 505 we saw at this year's CES but what about the concerns that I mentioned at the beginning of this video well those come down to power consumption and heat management since while AMD RX 5500 M is an improvement over previous generation it still looks inefficient compared to invidious nubuck models you see AMD claims that the RX 5500 M has a nominal power consumption of 85 watts and that can be configured upwards or downwards based on what a notebook design requires meanwhile Nvidia claims their gtx 660ti notebook GPU can be configured anywhere from 60 watts to 80 watts even though both AMD and NVIDIA measured power consumption differently the performance difference between these two GPUs is gonna be massive but they have similar power specs also just for your reference is the GTX 1650 Mobile is rated between 30 watts and 60 watts heat and power consumption are two huge factors for notebook manufacturers so we'll just have to wait and see how they able to incorporate the new Rx 5500 now another issue that I might see a me run to is delays caused by bottlenecks in these some nanometer manufacturing process you see we're already starting to see prices on rising 3000 CPUs skyrocket and that could potentially affect availability of these new GPUs so that's definitely something that I'm a little worried about so that pretty much covers everything and you know what guys I'm actually pretty excited for this little graphics card because it gets the latest architecture from AMD into a smaller form factor and power envelope and I think that's a great alternative for system builders who are looking to build affordable gaming rigs and that's great news but I want to know your thoughts about the Ark's 5500 in the comments down below I'm really curious to know what you guys think are you excited about it because I know it's pretty boring but curious to see where the curses really know what your thoughts are I mean were with Hardware Canucks thank you so much watching make sure to check out some relevant content over here subscribe and hit the notification button so that you don't miss out on a new video I'm signing off and I'll talk to you guys in the next one",

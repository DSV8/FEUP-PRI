    "transcript": "Its 1964. Finally. And you work at RCA Laboratories! Management has told you that we need to come up with some sort of product that would let consumers watch pre-recorded content on their ordinary television sets. How exactly are you gonna do that? Why, with holograms, of course! Welcome to the fourth and perhaps not final chapter in the saga that is the RCA SelectaVision Videodisc, also known as the CED or Capacitance Electronic Disc system. Its been, uh a while since we last looked at this so you may have forgotten a few things. You can, of course, check out this clicky thing to see the playlist on CED or you can find a link down in that there description thing. I will, however, recap the things most important to this chapter. RCA Laboratories had been, for years, a source of angst and envy in the company. They seemed to have limitless resources to do whatever they wanted to do, and it was up to the consumer divisions at RCA to actually apply their science work to produce a usable consumer product. Attempts to make the labs carry an idea from theory to market pretty much never worked, and factions in the labs had formed between make useful things and discover new science things. Having had tremendous success with three successive technologies, radio, television, and color television, but also having learned that these golden eggs were not forever lasting, RCA sought the next big thing, the sequel to color television. And that would be home video. They had no idea how they were gonna do that quite yet, but gosh darnit they were gonna do it. And fast. So fast that it would take 17 years. Spoiler alert. In 1964 there were four different ideas floating around. One involved using magnetic tape. See, this Japanese company called So-knee? Am I saying that right? They (and a few others) had been working on magnetic tape-based video technology that they figured would eventually get cheap enough for the consumer market. But lots of people at RCA scoffed at that idea, remembering the fiasco with the Videograph. Still, there was enough support that a pilot project was started in Indianapolis, chosen because this was where the consumer division was located. Meanwhile, another idea was floating around. This one, at the time called Discpix - thats DISC pix - was the genesis of the CED. To make Discpix practical, a lot of further work was needed. While Thomas Stanleys work in the Systems Research Laboratory had demonstrated the theoretical limits of storing information on a vinyl disc, turning that theory into practice required a ton of incremental work. And this was exactly the sort of work that nobody in the laboratories wanted to do. Remember, the Laboratories was staffed with scientists. They had attracted graduates of esteemed universities, promising that they could continue their work at RCA. Which is what they did. They were excited to discover new things and publish their results! Not to optimize an existing technology. Wheres the fun in that? Building enthusiasm for the Discpix project was thus very difficult. The laboratory directors had figured that the best thing to pursue would be the capacitive pickup approach suggested by Stanleys work. But - and I'm not kidding - the response to this was more-or-less ...mmm BORING. The researchers, quote, viewed this as the least interesting method and continued to work on multiple alternatives. One of these was the Photopix disc. You know those Viewmaster toys? With the little discs with stereoscopic images on film? Yeah, this was essentially that, but with a bigger disc, with way more (and way tinier) photographs, and, if that doesnt seem silly enough, this would be scanned by a vidicon tube to turn that into a television signal. So in essence this was a microscope with a television camera attached to it, and this was somehow gonna be feasible for a consumer product in 1964. Sure. But in fairness this seemed less bonkers than the capacitance setup. Because, as it turns out, this was in fact very hard to make work. Jon Clemens, a newly-hired engineer from MIT had given the Discpix project a boost, but he discovered within his first year that it couldnt work as originally conceived. There were simply too many complex interdependencies that would be exceedingly difficult to reconcile in an expedient and economically sensible fashion he said with tedious phrasing. In 1966 it seemed like nobody wanted Discpix anymore. I mean, did they ever? And work had been somewhat tabled. A few staff shake-ups moved people around, created some new divisions (both literal divisions of RCA and divisions between staff member ideologies) and im gonna skip through all that because now we need to get to the even more hilarious-in-hindsight idea; Holopix. Holopix worked by storing *holograms* on a vinyl disc, that would be hit with *a laser* to create an image which would be read by a vidicon tube and turned into a television signal. Yep. Now, this may sound incredibly complicated and shockingly ahead of its time for 1964, because it definitely was, but this was cool sh**! And people in the labs were like LASERS? HOLOGRAMS? SIGN ME UP! And so work on Holopix moved quickly. I mean, seriously, if you, an enthusiastic graduate from MIT or whatever had just gotten a job at RCA, and you had the choice between make records hold more stuff and use LASERS to stimulate HOLOGRAMS which would you choose? And, even weirdlier, this actually sorta worked. You see, they were able to stamp discs just like a normal record, and they demonstrated that, yeah, you could fire a pulsed laser at the thing, and the interference from the holographic surface on the disc could be read by a vidicon tube and turned into an image on a television. Color me surprised. But, of course, lasers had *barely been invented*, and vidicon tubes werent exactly mass-produced items, so two huge problems needed to be solved for this to have even a remote chance of being economically viable. But like. Lasers, man. And holograms. Neat. But then. Oh no. Out of nowhere, in late 1966, The New York Times published an article on a new thing CBS was working on called the EVR. This electronic video recorder was an oh crap moment, and RCA started freaking out. Of note, CBS was keeping quiet about it, in fact, they denied the reports. But this even got The Big Cheese David Sarnoff worried. CBS was, as you may recall, the arch nemesis of RCA. RCA had been able to put them in their place after the color television wars, but that didnt mean they couldnt pounce out of nowhere. Which is apparently what they were doing. So, in 1967, RCA was firmly in DO SOMETHING! mode. Discpix was back on, Holopix was given more funding, and even Photopix had been revived and turned into Phototape. In fact, Holopix also went from pix to tape once it was discovered that a disc couldnt hold enough information, but a loop of plastic tape could. So now its three competing things, Holotape, Phototape, and Discpix. Youll notice that none of these are using magnetic tape because people at RCA labs were still firmly in the belief that that would never be economically viable. And now we must explain that, in addition to this urgency, things at RCA were to take yet another sudden change. sudden and very tacky muzak ...another sudden change. David Sarnoff was in failing health, and he would step down from his role to be replaced by his son, Robert. The role of the laboratories was yet again to shift and yet another push would be made to make them, like, do stuff beyond fundamental research. And thus begins the next chapter in this soon-to-be catastrophe, the Robert Sarnoff years. Now, Ill admit here, that Im gonna gloss over a ton of particulars. There are a lot of reasons all this was about to go down and I dont want to get into them all, so please accept my apologies if I skip over some of the minutia. In many ways, CBSs announcement of the EVR was necessary for the development of the CED. Support within RCA was falling for a pre-recorded home video format, especially since the research efforts were so disjointed and didnt seem to be getting anywhere. But with CBS announcing they planned to do what RCA was so-far hesitant to do, suddenly the labs were pushed into making Holotape, Phototape, or Discpix work. So RCA needed to settle on one of the three. An effort was made to prioritize, and they settled on Holotape. But also Discpix. At this time, Thomas Stanley was in charge of the techological development for both projects, and he recognized that while there were way more problems to solve for Discpix, if they could be solved, it would make way more sense than Holotape. But at the same time, Holotape presented more opportunities for proprietary technologies, and that of course meant more patents. So he formed two teams, one to work on Discpix, and the other on Holotape. RCA was now in a race with CBS once again. They wanted something to be presented to the public, preferably before CBS was ready, and so they went into high gear. Despite its incredible complexity, Holotape was further along and could be demonstrated before Discpix. And so, in September of 1969, Holotape was selected for demonstration. And it was a bit of a disaster. It worked! That much is true. But the pictures were not great. There was no sound. It was still extraordinarily complicated. And, lets not kid ourselves, magnetic tape was kinda becoming viable. Dont tell anyone at RCA labs yet because theyre still in denial about that. But you know who isnt? The consumer divisions. Remember how I said a pilot program was started in Indianapolis focusing on magnetic tape? That was still going. That would soon be a source of tension, as youll see shortly. And while Stanley had said, \"dont worry, we havent made a firm choice yet between Holotape and Discpix\", the Discpix team couldnt help but see a demonstration of the rival system as a signal that they werent important anymore. So their work, already a bunch of tedious activities related to making this disc system barely functional, slowed in frustration. And this whole time, the old dynamic of labs does inventing, consumer divisions do everything else was still in the background. And now it was even more complicated than ever, as a new Selectavision Venture Group was making decisions about who was gonna do what. To quote Graham, (read the scrolling stuff, silly) If that sounds ridiculously fragmented, thats because it was! And nobody enjoyed being told what to do. Especially the Laboratories. This whole time, nobody was even remotely in agreement on virtually anything at all. It was a disaster. And yet somehow they were shooting for a public release of 1971. Good luck. With that. Guess what didnt happen? And it didnt happen for a huge number of reasons. For one thing, it seems rather silly to remove Laboratories from so much of the technical work. Why put the Electronics Components Division in charge of making a feasible vidicon and laser? Dontcha think the labs should have some input there? But mainly it was just a result of the whole nobody can agree on anything situation. Not even the basic format specifications. How can four teams in four divisions possibly work together if one group thinks this needs to hold an hour, the other thinks it needs to cost less than $3 to produce a tape, and the other is still trying to cost-optimize the vidicon tube? And the fourth one is doing something? But also, lets not forget that RCA was at this time a gi-freaking-gantic company with their hands in many different places. And one of those was computers. Yeah, RCA had a lot to do with computer systems in the 1960s. Their Computer Division was formed mainly to compete with IBM, and they produced a variety of mainframe computers. Indeed, they were the source of a few significant innovations. But they never really had great success with it. And in 1971 they decided to just give up and sell the computer division to UNIVAC. At a huge loss. And by huge, I mean $490 million. This, combined with an economic downturn, did not bode well for Holotape. In fact it kinda killed it. Meanwhile, the consumer electronics division in Indianapolis was still working on their magnetic tape efforts. Those rebels! Ray Warren, who worked in Indianapolis, had seen a demonstration of a new video tape system from Philips in 1970 and thought he could convince his bosses to take another stab at videotape. Now, tape was still really fiddly in these years. One of the reasons Laboratories was so against it was that it required high-precision manufacturing to make the tape transports compatible with pre-recorded tapes. None of RCAs divisions had that capability, and it would be tremendously expensive to develop such prowess, so why bother? But Warren had an idea. How about they farm that out? So in 1971 they contracted with Bell and Howell to produce the real finicky bits for them. And the Venture Group, still making decisions on behalf of everybody else, gave this idea the green light. And so Selectavision Magtape was now in the running. Im sure that will go over well at Laboratoires. Meanwhile, CBS had thrown in the towel. Their EVR system was going to cost just as much as a magnetic tape format, but couldnt record. So they gave up. And another thing happened, too. A European joint venture between Telefunken and Decca had created the Teldec format. suddenly, terribly tacky muzak makes a comeback This was very similar to the concept RCA had been working on for Discpix. And, just as the existence of EVR had created a sense of urgency for Holotape, now the existence of Teldec renewed interested in Discpix, and created that same sense of urgency for their team. Suddenly, Discpix was back in business. And now, a real internal showdown was about to occur. The Venture Group had decided Holotape was dead, and they decided they would pursue both the Magtape and the Discpix system. But there wasnt enough money. The accountants at RCA were strongly suggesting they choose between one of them, and now Laboratories was in direct competition with the consumer products division in Indianapolis. Which is of course great! Because no matter which one is chosen, those two groups are gonna need to work together eventually. And then, for a long time, nothing really happened. Alright, we are skipping forward in time because things get kinda dull here. Most important to know is that the losses from selling the computer division just kept hurting the development of both Magtape and Discpix. There wasnt enough money to establish programming for release. And there wasnt enough money to fix all of Discpixs various problems. In short, there just wasnt enough money. The cost-cutting and budget reductions moved people around yet again, and as a sort of kick-in-the-teeth, Avcos Cartrivision system, an early home video experiment using tape cartridges much like what RCA hoped to do with Magtape, was released in 1972 and sold very poorly. In the end, the entire venture group, once charged with figuring out the sequel to color television, ceased to exist. In October 1974, RCA announced that yeah, were giving up on this whole Magtape thing. The agreement with Bell and Howell had fallen apart, and Avcos Cartrivision was a disaster. It seemed like there was just no point continuing. This was both good and bad for RCA. For one thing it eliminated the in-fighting between the pro-tape factions and the pro-disc factions. But it also meant that they had left the magnetic tape business, a business which was clearly on the rise. Even if RCA didnt want to admit it. But now, finally, Indianapolis and the laboratories in Princeton could be on the same team. And surprisingly they were working together pretty well. Finally making an effort towards peace and harmony, people from the labs would travel to Indianapolis and vise-versa, which meant they could finally understand each others challenges, and they could help one another overcome them. Weird what can happen with the power of cooperation. The biggest challenge to overcome was arguably the mastering method. It was well it was way too costly and... way too slow. Now there was an argument being made that a complicated mastering technique could help insulate RCA from competition, especially since the actual players themselves would be pretty straight-forward to produce, but at this point were talking a mastering process that took about a week to make one usable stamper. So thats not great. But things improved swiftly. It looked like the product could be released as early as 1975. But then things got all corporately political again, and the labs and Indianapolis were at odds once more. Ugh. This story is so frustrating! And then, to make matters worse, in 1973 RCA got wind of Philips and MCAs new efforts on what would eventually become Laserdisc. This was a huge blow to the videodisc efforts. Philips/MCA seemed to have a much superior product, and corporate support for RCAs efforts dried up. Luckily, the R&D teams managed to make a number of significant improvements despite the apparent animosity, and support was regained. In the end the Philips announcement only set back RCAs timeline by six months or so, but this now meant the earliest possible release was 1976. Apparently on the same team again, now the consumer products division and labs needed to settle on how to make the discs. It became obvious that the conventional methods of producing vinyl audio records werent going to cut it. The discs would need to be made in clean-room settings, and injection molding seemed like it might be the right move. This now meant that the research departments needed not only to prove that these methods would work, but they also needed to procure the equipment to produce the discs, which wasnt exactly a run to the Home Depot. And all the while, the divisions needed to periodically drop what they were doing and present their progress to management. Which slowed them down a lot. And none of this was helped by the constantly shifting management landscape. As soon as someone took a leadership role who liked the Videodisc project, they were replaced by someone who didnt. Funding was frozen. Then it was re-issued. And during all this faffing about, Sony was hard at work on their soon-to-be-released Betamax video recorder. While this would ultimately spell the end for the hopes of RCAs videodisc (well, not specifically Betamax but videocassette recorders in general) this had the short-term effect of formally killing Magtape, as there was clearly no point continuing to make that happen. In March of 1975, RCA was ready to demonstrate the videodisc to the public. And a weird thing happened. Though RCA didnt think they were necessarily in competition with Philips/MCA, given at this point their laser-based system wasnt destined for home use, the press found a juicy battle in the making and suddenly RCA had competition they didnt think they had. But for the time being, the press was on RCAs side, painting the laser-based system from Philips/MCA as needlessly complicated and costly. Still, now RCA had to deal with a PR situation they didnt ask for. Now, if youre thinking, well, why would that be a problem?, let me tell you why that would be a problem! RCAs reputation was starting to get pretty bad in the mid seventies. Under Robert Sarnoffs leadership, RCA went from a consumer products manufacturer to a general business conglomerate. They had acquired such wide-ranging companies as Hertz rental cars, Coronet carpeting, Random House publishing, and Banquet foods. RCA suddenly stood for Rugs, Chickens, and Automobiles according to their detractors. And this strategy was not going well, with profits seemingly in a free-fall. Robert Sarnoff was ousted in 1975, just as the videodisc project was getting off the ground, and his successor, Anthony Conrad, didnt exactly care for the videodisc. In fact Edgard Griffiths, in charge of RCAs electronics business and a direct subordinate of Conrad, despised it and urged Conrad to kill it. Sonnenfeldt, the leader of the Videodisc project, made a grand appeal to Conrad. He argued that RCA needed another home run like Color Television, and that CED would be it. RCA had become rather risk-averse in this time, and this put them way behind. Rival television manufacturer Zenith had leapfrogged RCA in terms of quality and sales. Zenith had adopted a follower position and was doing quite well with that tactic. Zenith was able to make a lot of money just by improving on the work of others, and some people argued that RCA should maybe start to do the same sorts of things. But Sonnenfeldt reminded Conrad that RCAs pioneering investment in color television had been recouped many times over. They made their money by being leaders, not followers, and he urged Conrad to continue the videodisc project. By now, the earliest the videodisc could possibly be released to the public was May 1977, and there was still a lot of work to do. Sonnenfeldt convinced Conrad to let him continue work on the videodisc until mid-1976 at which point they would re-evaluate. At this point, the discs were still being manufactured in a multi-step process which relied on a machine called an auto-coater. The procurement of these machines was delayed, and when they finally got them, the videodisc team was dismayed to find that this method just sucked! Discs deteriorated too quickly. The yield of good discs was abysmal. And, at this point, the discs were still naked, so virtually any human contact would render them useless. Already a 1977 release was out the window. But Conrad remained supportive, and he told shareholders in August of '76 that theyd have the system ready for introduction in '78. But then and Im sure youll be surprised to hear this, Conrad was out. He had resigned after admitting to failing to file his taxes for six years. Yikes. Well now. Whos his successor gonna be? And what will they think? His successor was Edgar Griffiths, the guy who didnt like the videodisc project at all. That doesnt bode well, does it? Griffiths ordered a report comparing the potential of the Videodisc against Sonys Betamax. That report suggested that people favored the ability to record on tapes, and their reusability, but also that price was a significant factor. If the videodisc could be substantially cheaper, than it would probably work. The report suggested that RCAs device should sell for less than $400, and if that target could be met it would probably be at least a modest success. But Griffiths still wasnt happy. He was still leaning towards killing the project. He asked all of the managers involved with the project what the impact would be if he shut it down. One argument against doing so was that it would be a very bad look for RCA given how badly they had been performing, and what with the tax evasion by their former CEO. But others were strongly against continuing. They felt it was too risky, and competition from Japanese companies was getting very intense. But at the same time, RCAs dealers were wondering when the hell they would have an answer to Betamax. And the competition from Japan could be seen as a reason FOR the videodisc. In fact, back in 1974, RCA had done something that might have secured the success of videodisc. But it also might have doomed it from the start. *sigh* Yep. I said I didnt want to do it. I said I didnt want to have to do a part five. Heres me saying that; I dont wanna have to do a part 5 Well. Tune in next time for CED Part 5! Where we look at RCAs attempts to convince Japanese manufacturers to license their CED technology. RCA had hoped that they could create the definitive video format and get ahead of both videotape and any other disc competition. But, unbeknownst to RCA, those efforts would result in a betrayal which would force them to rush CED to completion on their own. Well also look at the final revisions RCA needed to make to make the CED just work, and its performance in the market after its eventual release. Thanks for watching, and congratulations on making it this far! As always, Id like to thank everyone supporting the channel on Patreon, with a special thanks to the fine folks scrolling up your screen. And also, another warm thanks goes out to Margaret B. W. Graham for her work on this amazing book. Without your efforts these videos would not be possible. Thank you for writing it. Cue the music! disjointedly smooth jazz Welcome to the fourth and, perhaps not, final chapter in the saga that is the hue, I forgot Philips and MCAs new effort on p pbt pb tpbtpb [gratuitous lips noises] Dont screw up because then youre gonna make it worse and youre gonna youre gonna youre gonna think you could maybe get away with that line, and then youre gonna second guess yourself, and then you really cant. So fast tha so fast that wooh! Thats hard to say. And people in the labs were like LA --- yeah no, Im too [clears throat] Dont like that delivery at all! I mean seriously if you, an enthusiastic graduate from Ehhhh. And also, another very warm thanks goes out to this is upside down. Did you hear about the bus driver that didn't see people waiting at the stop? Turns out someone forgot to install the latest driver updates. That was absolutely terrible but I'm not gonna apologize.",

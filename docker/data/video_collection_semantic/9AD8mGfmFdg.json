    "transcript": "(soft music) - It is 9:21. We are here in Seattle at the University Village Center and this is the brand-new Apple store that is opening up. I am so excited! Me and Jenna flew in last night just to be here for the grand opening. And this store is absolutely beautiful. We stopped by last night to take a look at it before they closed down the Apple store that is right next to it, which was opened in September of 2003. And this one is brand new. They've been working on it for over three years. I think this actually used to be like a parking lot or something? There's also a living roof on the top. There's like bees and flowers and grass. So we have about seven minutes before the store opens. Let's go take a look at the line! Come on! (soft music) First in line! Are you first in line? - Yeah! - High five, yes, I love first in line people! How long have you been waiting? - I've been here since six am. - Oh, okay, that's not too bad! That's good. Yeah, we once slept outside for 56 hours for the iPhone 6. I don't wanna do it again. (laughing) - Hi. - Hi! Come on, come on! Everybody has Apple shirts and hats. Everybody has an iPhone and Apple Watch. This is so great. Hi! Look at this! - Hi! - You've got one of the old school Apple logos. This is so cool. - I love your videos! - Thank you! Hi, hello! Okay, we got a long way to go. I'll wait. - [Jenna] Have you ever been last in line? - Today, today's the day. (upbeat music) (upbeat music continues) Oh my goodness, look what you brought! This is so cool and in front of the Apple store, too. - I saw your Instagram story yesterday, I was like, whoa! We were just freaking out. - [Justine] Well thanks for coming by! - Thank you for coming here. - So we're minutes away before the grand opening and here is the line behind me. I'm signing an iPhone! (gasping) The employees are getting so close to the door! So this is what we're gonna do. We're gonna film them going in, Jen. And then we're gonna run to the back and then we're gonna run in so they'll clap for us. Does that sound good? - [Jenna] I think so. - Okay, good. - [Jenna] A lot of running. - Oh my gosh, it's happening! It's happening, it's happening! (cheering) - [Justine] First in line! (continued cheering) This is so exciting! We're going in! (cheering) Yay! (crowd cheering) - Alright, good to see you! - You too! Hi! (cheering) Oh my goodness! We're inside! We're inside. (crowd continues cheering) You said you've been watching my videos for a really long time. - For ten years. - Oh, my goodness. - Yes. - This is so cool. - I was really, really young. - How old are you now? - I am 24. - Oh wow! So you were like a baby! - I was 14 when I started watching you and no one else was watching YouTube so this is insane. My little town in England, so here. - Okay, you were in England? - I'm from France. - So now you're here? - I was in England in boarding school and now I'm here and I work in tech. - This is incredible. - This is insane! - Small world, high five. - High five. - So we're gonna get a shot of the roof. We have to go up on the Crate & Barrell balcony so we can get a good shot of it. So, let's go. Also, I'm wearing a pineapple shirt because I couldn't find an Apple shirt. So it was the closest thing to an apple that I could find. You get it now? There it is. (soft guitar music) (soft guitar music continues) So we made it up to the roof which gives us a really great view of the living roof which is kind of amazing. Unfortunately we can't go all the way up there. Now let's go through and do a tour of the entire store. We're starting on the other side. You saw us go in on the entrance, so this is the back side of it. So let's go in and check it out. But before we do, there's the old store. It's all wrapped in navy blue. They have such an awesome open floor plan. So it basically is bringing the outside in. They actually have a tree in the middle of the store. This is Jenna's present (Jenna gasping) I'm gonna get her this. - [Jenna] Wow! - And I think I'm gonna get myself this one. I like the white with the black. Oh, I'm shopping. Should I get a new toothbrush? We'll be back for those. The best part about this is when it does snow in Seattle, they said that this is gonna kind of turn into a snow globe. Come on, let's go see what else we can see. So this is where we came in at when the doors opened. So this is the front of the store. I love that they have this open patio area so you can kinda just come sit, drink coffee, have fun. Be with the people. I wanna be where the people are. I wanna see, wanna see em typing. That's good, huh? So today at Apple, let's have a seat. At 11 AM they're having studio hours for all projects. At PM, basics for iPad. This screen is massive, let's put it in perspective of my body. (soft music) So continuing on from the big TV, this is the back of the store. So we basically have just made one big loop. There's a boardroom! Wow is that fancy. Laptops, iMacs, aplenty. I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty. Oh! - [Jenna] Oh, blue! - Look how nice this one is. Whoa. Oh, wow! This is much better than the first version that they came out with. I've got some things on my wishlist. What does he do? Is he an AR bear? Oh my gosh, yes look! Oh, my gosh! (laughing) Okay this is actually really neat. Look at him dancing. Oh, okay. - [Jenna] Well, we'll see ourself out. - I need a bigger tabletop. Well I think I've officially seen the whole store. Let's walk out here to the patio. And now we're back where we started. What a beautiful, beautiful store. It's crazy how awesome it is. Well guys, that is the new Apple store here at the University Village Center in Seattle. This was so awesome. I hope you guys enjoyed the tour. Let me know if you guys ever make it out here. And if there's another Apple store you'd like me to check out, make sure you guys leave those in the comments below and maybe I'll come and visit you guys at your Apple store. Does it really? - [Jenna] No. - Are you serious? - [Jenna] No, I was just kidding. - Oh. - [Jenna] Sorry. - Because there is one in New York that says don't touch. - [Jenna] Oh, no. - Okay well let's go back in. (upbeat music) This is the peach. - [Jenna] I like this blue. - Because I feel like this is too similar. (laughing) So I shouldn't do that. Should I buy the toothbrush? Should I buy the toothbrush? - [Jenna] No. - Noooo. Yay! - [Jenna] Yay! - Here you go. - [Jenna] Thank you. - For you. Oh! But here's the thing, guess what. - [Jenna] It's for the 10! - Surprise! Okay. New case, who dis. All of the new watch bands are all sold out here, already. So we might have to get them online. Here's yours, Jen. - [Jenna] Thank you. A gift. - A gift. One of the really cool store design features is all of the lines match up evenly. Everything is perfect and symmetric. So even these little lines here on the sidewalk, everything matches up. And the inside from the tile floor to the walls, all of the seams are even and match. (upbeat relaxing music) 2003 to 2018. All closed up. Well yeah, but it's over there now. - [Guy On Bike] Okay, that's right there. - That's the new store. - So we've been talking about getting coffee this whole video, well guess what, we did. And now, they've told us that we have to try the chairs. It really is a perfect sit. I am living my best Apple life right now. Okay I guess that's the end of the video now. Bye! (upbeat music)",

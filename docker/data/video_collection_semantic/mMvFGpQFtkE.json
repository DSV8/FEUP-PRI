    "transcript": "- Hello, and welcome to \"This Is.\" It's happened. We thought it wouldn't, we thought they'd hold out, but it finally happened. Xbox has let us down. - How? Did they cancel the One S, Series S? Did they make \"Candy Crush\" a default game on all Xbox platforms? - They already did that with Windows, didn't they? - Did they actually do that? (Austin laughs) - So, no. Microsoft has announced that their first party titles... - [Austin] \"Halo,\" \"Forza.\" - [Matt] Are going to get the price hike from $60 a game to $70 a game. When Sony made their switch, they said, \"Okay, PS5 games, 70 bucks.\" - Yep. - All right. And Xbox said, \"No, we're not gonna do that.\" That was a great move. However, inflation comes for us all, which sucks because no one wants to spend $70 for a game. So here we are. Like, we're seeing everything go up. We're seeing everything increase. We've seen consoles increase. - This change will take effect starting next year. - Yes. - Going forward, you should expect to pay $70 for new first party Xbox game. And I'm assuming that's also going to be on non-Xbox's, right? So if you wanna play \"Forza\" on say, Steam, they will probably jump the price up $70 there, as well. No, there are a couple of things to talk about here. First and foremost is the most obvious, buy Game Pass. Look, that's what they're doing here. They're wanting you to just sign up for Game Pass, 'cause Game Pass, as far as I know, not getting a price hike. - It will be. Phil Spencer has said that it will happen eventually. - [Austin] Well, of course, I mean, everything goes up in price. - [Matt] Right. - You can expect price hikes on gas, on food, on other important staples like your Netflix subscription. - Why is life so expensive? (background music stops) (loud interference sound) - Obviously, Microsoft have an incentive here to sell more Game Pass subscriptions. Fair enough. - And I'm fine with this. This makes- We've been talking about how Game Pass is the better value proposition. If you're on Xbox as your platform, 9 out of 10 players should just be on Game Pass. - Well, especially if you consider, you buy two $70 games in a year, that's covered your entire year of Game Pass. - Yep. - Am I doing my math? - Pretty much. It depends, like if you have to buy like the year up front, like it's 15 bucks a month if you go month-to-month. - Sure, sure. - But even then, it's two-and-a-half games. If you're one of the weird creatures that only plays \"Call of Duty\" and \"Madden,\" then you- - Wait. Did you say \"weird creatures\" when you described 50 to 60% of all gamers? - The key word there is \"only play Madden.\" - Bro, I bet you most people who have a console play 1 to 3 games per year. You're gonna play \"Call of Duty,\" you're gonna play \"Madden,\" you gonna play \"FIFA.\" - I'm the casualest of gamer, and I go through about twenty. - You play \"Bloons.\" - I play like the first 3 levels of a game, I go, \"Oh, this is too hard for me,\" and then I never play it again. Which is what happened with \"Elden Ring.\" Obviously, every Sony fanboy is gonna be like, \"Hahaha, $70? What games are they charging on? They don't have any games. They don't have a single game on that platform.\" - That's not what Sony people sound like, but okay. (Austin laughs) - What does your Sony fanboy voice sound like? - \"Boy, oh boy! I love PlayStations! PlayStations are the best!\" But I do think there's one thing to talk about here. - [Matt] Yeah. - Which, obviously, inflation is a thing, right? And lots of things are going up in price. But think about the historical pricing of games. When I was but a Wii Lad wanting to buy a Game Boy game, they were about 30 bucks. 30 bucks was standard. And I wanna say like PlayStation, like N64 games. I feel like PlayStation games are usually about $40, right? Like that kind of felt like where things roughly were. I remember 40, you started hitting like 50 I feel like in the PS2 generation. And then ever since the Xbox 360 and PS3, $60 has pretty much been the standard for three whole generations. While Matt might have the fancy calculations on what the inflation is, I'm pretty sure the $60 game in 2005 is a whole lot more than $70 in 2023 money. - So I had Kenzie go and look for all these inflated prices. - Can we do a little game here? I don't wanna look at that. - [Matt] Yeah. All right. - Hit me with prices and I'll try to tell you what they were. - I only have a couple of them. - Okay. Let see if I can guess the inflation adjusted price in today's dollars. So an NES game in 1985. - How much was it in '85, dollars? - $45. - Ooh. Okay, so 1985, there was a lot of inflation in the 80s. I'm gonna say $100. - [Matt] It's $177. - People are paying $177 for \"Duck Hunt\"? What? - It came with a gun. - Look, no wonder the video game industry was not doing good in the 80s. You wonder why companies like Atari printed millions of copies. They're making bank! They could afford to put half their inventory on a landfill. They just made 13 trillion dollars in today's money selling you \"E.T.\" - Average N64 and PlayStation game. Just average- - Oh, together. - There was some discrepancies, but the average was $49.99 in 1995, 1996. - Okay, I'm gonna restate $100. - [Matt] Closer. It was $94,95. - [Austin] We were paying 94 bucks for PlayStation One games. - [Matt] Yeah. - United States Freedom Unit don't go as far as it used to. Back in my day, $40 would buy you a whole PlayStation game. Now you get three Fortnite skins and an Apex Legend- - Average Xbox game. - So Xbox/PS2 era. Like 2002? - 2001 we have on here. - 2001. Okay. The games were 50 bucks new? - $49,99. - $75. - $84,17. And then we have the average Xbox 360 game. - 2005? - 2005. - $60. - $60. $59,99, if we're getting- Yeah. - Okay. $60 in 2005 was... $80. - [Matt] $91,54. - So basically we've been paying $60 since 2005 for games. - Yeah. - But inflation adjusted, that used to be $91, and it's basically gotten progressively cheaper. 'Cause every year inflation goes up and the price of games doesn't change. - People don't feel that, you know? - No, of course. - It's like- - How much was gas in 2005? Think about that. - We feel gas inflation- - Wait, wait, wait. (Austin laughs) Matt, Matt, I need you to do that one more time. Inflation on gasoline prices. Go ahead, hit me. - Yeah. You feel the prices of inflated gas. - Yep. - [Matt] I said it again. (Austin mumbles) (Austin and Matt laughing) Games is a little different because, you know, like, oh, if they go up at like 10 bucks, it's like, \"Oh man, we went up 10 bucks!\" But like you don't feel it as much. You don't feel that creeping like spending power. - Well, I think part of the reason is the prices stayed the same for so long, right? Like you kinda got used to it. Now if you think about it from the perspective of what's happened in gaming over the last, what, 15 years. DLC has become a massive partner. In 2005 DLC didn't really exist, which is why- - Might get a little bit, like, you know, a couple maps or like- - That was the very beginnings of that, right? And you think, okay, $90 would fund a very expensive game. So what's happened since then is games have gotten wildly more expensive to develop. Right? You know, the teams are bigger, the tools are- Like, it's just so much more expensive. Especially when you look at games like \"Elden Ring,\" which is like, what, 17 years and 400 trillion or whatever, I don't know, very expensive, right? - \"GTA 6\" was a billion dollars to develop? - There's no way they said how much they've spent on \"GTA 6,\" really? - [Matt] \"GTA 6\" is reportedly having a $2 billion budget. - Boy, they need- - Here's the thing- I wanna- This is a side note. This has nothing to do with game monetization. They don't need to make a game for $2 billion. - [Austin] Okay? - I would pay $60 to see 2 billion dollars. They could just have a room set up, and I would pay money to see that much money. - So games are costing more and more to develop, all the time. Only, in my opinion, the only reason why we've only been paying $60 for games for so long, is because things like DLC, things like deluxe editions, things that will give you added value have come onto the scene. Which is really kinda helped because- - All the microtransactions, everything like that. Which everyone hates, by- - You know, you say that. I bet- Look, everyone. Come close. Let's all be honest with ourselves. Have you ever spent 90, 100 dollars on a game you really like? Just think about it. Between maybe buying \"FIFA\" packs, maybe buying additional cars in \"Grand Turismo,\" maybe playing \"Bloons\" for way too many hours, and buying too many Bloon coins or whatever. - How do I get all my heroes? - We all have spent that kind of money. But there's a difference, because, nowadays, it's sort of split between free-to-play games, which have lots and lots of microtransactions, and 60 and $70 games, which have lots of microtransactions, but maybe will actually give you like, you know, DLC, maps, like other actual tangible things for that cash. But most people, if it's a game you really like, are probably spending more than 60 bucks anyway. - One of the problems is we could say, \"Oh yeah, well, this has been so cheap for, you know, years of it being $60 for games.\" - Yeah. - It's not like they be like, \"Okay, you know what? We're charging an extra 10 bucks, you know, for this game. Because of that, we're gonna cut off these microtransactions.\" That's not happening. - In the context of things, going from 60 to $70 isn't that bad is sort of my thought on it. When you consider, again, the quality of games. And the fact that, \"If you really like the game, you're probably gonna spend a little bit of extra money on it anyway.\" And also, Game Pass exists. - You know what I think, though, is egregious? - Okay, yeah. Hit me. - Is some of the collector's editions that we're selling. Because it used to be, you buy a collector's edition, and it'd be like, \"Oh, here's this merchandise.\" - Art books. Steel books. - Yeah. That merchandise might be moldy and filled with spores. You can see what I'm talking about right here. But you got something tangible. Now we're getting all these, like, super editions that are like crazy more money. And it's just all in-game. - [Austin] Wait, are you trying to say that me buying the super deluxe version of \"Grand Turismo\" to get millions of dollars of in-game credit and some extra cars was a bad idea? I would never ever pay to win- I mean, pay to have more money. He's got \"NBA 2K23\" up here. So, PS4, 60 bucks, PS5 is 70 bucks. - Here's the thing, \"NBA 2K\" kind of rubs people the wrong way a little bit, too, because it is two separate editions. I get it. If you have a PS4 you wanna spend less money. But if you buy the PS4 version and then get a PS5 later, you still playing the PS4 version. - Yeah, I would say Sony feels like the PlayStation side seems worse. - If you want to have both versions in one purchase, you have to buy the digital deluxe edition, which comes with both versions. But then you can also get, for $100, the Jordan edition. Which means nothing because- - What? I'm gonna get Michael Jordan in my game, right? - You get 100 VC and 23 team promo packs. - [Austin] That's a lot of packs. - [Matt] So booster box. Oh, you do get the Diamond Jordan shoe. - This is a great point. We also totally forgot. These are all the same prices for digital and physical games. - Yeah. - And, obviously, everything's going digital. So they also have saved money by not actually having to- You know, obviously- - We been talking about that for years. - I know. They've been trying to like move on from, you know, you had cartridges, then you had discs, then like the disc comes in like literally the most generic little plastic box that has no anything. Now it's not even the disc, you're still paying the same amount. - Coming back around. The value proposition for the Xbox game is still just pushing towards Game Pass. - [Austin] Of course. Yeah. - And like, again, it just makes Game Pass look that much more appealing. And when we think about all the things we're getting with Game Pass, you're getting your Xbox Live Gold, you're getting Cloud Gaming if you want it. That's whatever. If you want it want- - There's lots of stuff that's included if you get it. PC Game Pass Ultimate- - Like all the first party games that they're doing are day one available on Game Pass. - Yeah. So can I be honest with you about my current generation gaming habits? So between Xbox and PlayStation, I own no physical games for my PS5. - I also don't. - I've not purchased a single, physical PS5 disc. - The only physical game that I own at the moment Is \"Spider-Man\" for PS4. Because I bought the limited edition, and it came with it. - I own a fair few digital copies of PS5 games. I own zero first party Microsoft Games, because I have them all on Game Pass. I have not purchased any of them whatsoever in like five years, six years. I'm fully on that Game Pass train, because it's like, even if I'm only gonna play a couple games a year, it's already worth it. Right? So to me it's like, I get it, it's more expensive, that's never a good thing, but when consider the historical sort of context here of how much cheaper games are, even at 70 bucks, than they were in 2005, 2006, when we were purchasing them for 60 bucks each, which was like $90 in today's money. And you consider that you have the ability to download these easily with things like Game Pass, obviously, PlayStation plus, Ultra 5K edition will give you some games for free, and including your subscription. But like, we've got it good today. I think it's worth just kind of keeping in mind. It's easy to complain, it's easy to be bloated, but, it's pretty good. - Let's put a big old asterisk next to everything you just said. - What do you mean? - Because here's what we had. We're talking about, like, we love Game Pass, we love it. - Full disclosure, we have been sponsored by Game Pass in the past, but that also doesn't change the fact that it's a good service. - Yeah. Really good service. But you know what we also used to love? We used to love Netflix. - Oh. - Netflix used to be, \"Oh, I could have whatever movie I want for a mere small month-to-month cost.\" I wanna break down Netflix pricing in the past 11 years. - For context, I've been a subscriber for Netflix since like 2012 or something. - I've been a subscriber of streaming since day one. - [Austin] 2011 Netflix. G0. - [Matt] 8 bucks a month. That is the standard HD plan with two screens. Now is $15,49. - [Austin] So it's basically doubled in price. - Yeah. All this content that's on all these other streaming platforms was on Netflix. If you wanted \"The Office,\" Netflix. If you wanted \"Parks and Rec',\" Netflix. Now we have, in 2013, that's when they introduced the 4K premium one. - [Austin] I remember I signed up for that. - [Matt] Which remember, it gives you no additional content. It's $20 a month. Ugh. It's a lot. - I like 4K. - I do, too. - Would you watch \"This Is\" in HD? - You're doing it right now. (Matt chuckles) - Make sure you're on 4K. Make sure you're on 4K. We are recording in 4K. Use 4K. You guys see every beard here in Matt's face? You'll see it in crystal clear 4K for only $12,99 a month when you sign up for the \"This Is\" monthly subscription plan. You can watch our videos in 4K if you give us money, even though you can do it for free, but give us money. - The takeaway from this is, what happens in, you know, a few years when Game Pass starts creeping up, and they say, \"Okay, well, play your favorite games at 30 FPS for $15 a month, or you can pay $30 a month to play at 60+.\" - Matt, I might vomit. - So like, follow, subscribe. Let us know what you think about this. Is there any games coming for Xbox? (Austin laughs) You'd love to tell us that one. - Supposedly they'll be $70 next year if anything comes out. Whoo! - Like, follow, subscribe, and we'll catch you in the next one. (mellow music)",

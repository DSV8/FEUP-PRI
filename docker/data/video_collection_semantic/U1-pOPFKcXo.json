Hey everyone it's David Bombal back with a very very special guest Angelina welcome. Thank you so much for having me on the show David it's an honor to be here. Angelina you got an amazing story and I really want to use your story as inspiration for others who are interested in getting into cyber security or you know changing careers or just an inspiration to younger people so you got to ask I've got to ask this question unfortunately how old are you? Yes I just turned 18 years old. That's great because I think that's a real inspiration to other young people you got to tell me when did you start coding? Yeah so I started coding pretty young I started in elementary school after taking a basic coding class at the age of seven and from there I've been enamored by the field of both computer science and cyber security and applying that to the Aerospace sector. That's amazing so you started coding at 7 and you got to tell me as well how many languages can you code in? yeah so I am proficient in about 20 different languages I work on on all sorts of projects ranging from like firmware devices that use low-level code like C and Rust all the way up to higher level stuff like JavaScript and typescript in order to make web applications and apps. You you programming Go as well right? Yes in order to make security tools my primary language is Go Lang and I also use a bit of Python. Yes so that that that that gets me to the next question how did you get interested in cyber security because that's a cool story as well? yeah so I got interested in cyber security after taking a cyber security workshop on trading payloads hosted by my now boss Cody Kinsey and during that Workshop we were putting together the Wi-Fi nuggets that is Cody's primary project and that really um enamored me by the capabilities of cyber like how a really cheap microcontroller can exploit an entire computer system and having a computer science background at that point I was really fascinated by the entire field and then from there I got recruited by Ria in order to start making Ed educational content focused on cyber security I first started off by making rudimentary hardware tools so I made a tiny little compact Wi-Fi reconnaissance device that did packet monitoring alongside detection for common Wi-Fi attacks such as deauthentication and disassociation called the Y-Con kit and ever since I created that compact Hardware tool I was really enamored by making open- Source cyber security tools in all Realms of cyber security that I was interested in. It's amazing you've got to let's get a bit of a timeline because that that that's it's a really cool story so you started coding when you were seven I believe you were still a young teenager when you started like doing work is that right. Yes I started working for startups when I was about 14 years old and then I got my first job position within cyber security at the age of 15. That's crazy so you were 14 you were Contracting but you got your first cyber job at 15 years old did I did I hear that right? Yes that's correct. And you also worked for a very special place called NASA I believe. Yes when I was I think 17 well 17 years old I started conducting research for NASA and it was interesting how I got into NASA because I was recruited to do very non-cyber related research in the beginning so I was doing research specifically on meteorites and the chemical composition of meteorites called volatiles in order to study the origins of the universe but then when I started looking at some of the open source programs that NASA releases NASA has an amazing open- Source programming projects the open source a lot of their code and I was looking through and I was just being perceptive of their code base yeah and trying to audit it based off on my programming skill and I noticed that a lot of the languages that NASA was using was really old or Legacy programming languages they were using Fortran alongside very old variants of C and that was that kind of set off a alarm Bell in my head because those y like using redundant coding languages is not a good coding standard and that really incentivized me to look more into the field of space security. That's amazing so I mean I'm taking it you understand Fortran C amongst those 20 languages right? Yes that's correct. What's your favorite languages because I mean that's quite a quite a wide range of languages? I've always been heart and soul a software developer um allot the jobs I've taken throughout my have been in software development so I'm a little biased but I spent a lot of my time coding in TypeScript and I really like it because whenever I'm coding I really like to be Super Hyper organized and methodical about the code base and TypeScript really allows me to do that. That's amazing so 14 you started working 15 you started getting into cyber security 17 you at Nasa and you also met a very famous person from Apple right? Yes so I think that was when I was about 14 I that was when I that was during the stage of my life where I really got into mobile app development especially for iOS I've had an iPod since I was I think eight years old my mom got got it to me as a birthday gift and ever since then I've been really fascinated by Apple products and an Apple hosts an anal International coding challenge called the Swift student Challenge and I applied that year and I was one of the five students that was invited to head to Apple's headquarters in Cupertino and got to meet the CEO of Apple himself Tim Cook and present my apps to him. yeah you got to tell us a story about that um app because I think some people watching will be thinking oh you're you came from a lot of money you had a like a really rich background but perhaps you can tell us a story about that app my background is a little bit um different I was raised in like an immigrant family um from Japan my mom's from Japan and she came here by herself with her three kids I was born in the us but we lived in Japan for a little bit because that's my mom's Hometown and um I didn't have a father growing up he passed away very young so he sorry about that no worries um my mom had to move our entire family here to the US in order to raise us and I think that's what pretty incentivized me to become a programmer because I was always taught with the values of being independent um I didn't have a lot of like paral figures growing up so I I was always taught to figure things out on my own and explore projects by myself and I think that although like it was challenging during my childhood it really fortified me into becoming a resilient individual it made me a better programmer because it taught me to figure out problems by myself and not be completely reliant on someone else or support so some of the applications I submitted for the Swift student challenge included one was lilac which was to help um other people in like the same situation as my mother so my mother didn't really speak a lot of English coming into this country so I like during parent teacher conferences I had to translate on her behalf and that was like kind of a problem because I was like seven years old and I just learned English so I had to like translate between Japanese and English all the time and I really wanted to help solve that issue so that's where the application of lilac came about and then I also created a CPR application as well called pocket CPR which just made for the Apple watch and that idea came about during the pandemic where I took online CPR classes and I had a lot of trouble learning the compression rates because in CPR like usually you have to match like a specific Cadence rate when you're compressing the chest um and in order to solve that problem I created a Apple watch application um that assists in individuals learning CPR either in like an online or even an iners inperson setting by using hatic feedback such as vibration from the Apple watch in order to match the Cadence properly but I love that story right and I think it's an inspiration for everyone that you know you can come from difficult circumstances but like if you use the skills that you've got and just with the right attitude you can do amazing things and I mean your story is amazing I mean you're 18 years old and you've already accomplished all of this I mean 20 coding languages I think a lot of us are still struggling to learn one properly so I mean that that's amazing and you've you've already created these apps so is your love coding or is your love cyber security or is it like a toss between the two I would say my passion is technology in general technology for Progress technology for the betterment of humanity um I believe technology is a double-edged sword in a sense that it can be used for both good and bad and I think the key is to utilize technology with Consciousness in a keen sense of wisdom and a moral compass in order to better others within your own community and also within the world and I I've always been passionate about utilizing my skill set to import change and make the world a better place because sometimes you know with we're constantly being bombarded with news about negative conflicts that are even arising the world and that can make us feel hopeless but I think my message to that would be to take things into your own hands because you have a lot more control than you think and if you utilize your skill set and if you really apply yourself to not making yourself just better but to making other people better and importing benevolent change to not just your local community but also to society itself um it brings a lot of purpose and meaning in your life I love that I I strongly agree it's if you just do your best every day and focus on what you can control and focus on what you can do it can really change your life like simply studying or simply trying things like if you hadn't if you hadn't written those applications if you hadn't submitted your application to uh to NASA I mean yeah you wouldn't have had that opportunity right yeah I think everything is connected and like all like effort you put out into the world whether it succeed or fails is going to contribute something like maybe you're probably going to learn something through the process of it so I would emphasize the outcome I would emphasize the progress um and like trying best every single day in order to improve your skill set and applying yourself and in the end you're probably going to get lucky at some point because before that opportunity um where I got invited to Apple's headquarters I'd probably ridden like a 100 programs and I got no crit for it like no one saw them um a a lot of people discouraged me at that point they were like at school um I didn't really have a lot of friends at that point I was just sit on the corner I would code on my computer and I was like oh when is this ever going to pay off um yeah but then one day I got an email from Apple's headquarters saying you're invited to the worldwide developer conference and I don't think that would have been been possible if I hadn't approved the skill from the 100 previous projects I worked on before that point I mean it's I think it gets lost sometimes I mean you're 18 years old but you've been coding since you were seven right so I mean this is like a decade of coding that you've been over a decade of and I was I think 14 when I got invited to Apple's headquarters so that was six years of coding and those six years I didn't get any like amount of attention it was just like ruling like work I enjoyed programming but um I didn't really get like a lot of tangible success out of it it was a lot more like I don't know skill development but there's not a lot of people encouraging me at that point yeah but I love that I mean it's um I mean some people have been waiting longer I mean right yeah some people wait decades for success to come out but at that point they've already ACR the skill and I think it's also like an intrapersonal thing as well like showing up every day proves something to yourself and it's not it's never about proving your skill to other people it's about proving it to yourself and it gives you a sense of self-resilience and self-confidence um knowing that every single day you put in a little bit of work in order to improve yourself and I think everyone's growing and everyone's developing and that's one of the fundamental concepts of life and it brings a deep sense of purpose I love this I mean I think you're a huge inspiration for people who are perhaps younger starting their Journey that don't let age stop you and it's for older people I can say the same thing don't let your age stop you right just accept who you are and do what you can with the talents that you've got and the skills that you've got yeah definitely yeah I think humans are born thinkers like you have a mind and regardless of your age your ideas have value and they have like physical like weight to it and never like hesitate to like think of crazy ideas in your mind or like visualize things and don't let other people especially if they're older like criticize your ideas always be perceptive I teach a lot of kids and one thing I try to emphasize when I'm teaching these kids is to be expressive like always be willing to show your passion don't let adults or any like authority figure um beat down your passion I've had a lot of problems in school where you know I think I was like over passionate I wasn't really yeah like into the school system so I had a lot of authority figures in my life like either I don't know condom me or like great some of some of my passions because I was like overly passionate but like don't let like PE people like that hold down your dreams or your passions um I I I would just say like be perceptive of other people's ideas as well um and also be perceptive of your own ideas and treat them without judgment but I love that I mean if you had listened to some of those people you wouldn't be where you are today 18 years old but because you were so focused on your vision and your goal and you put the work in look at what you've accomplished yeah definitely I think one thing that sent me apart around my career and helped me a lot is having a strong vision and believing in that Vision no matter what and I think there's always going to be ups and downs throughout your career and I've had a lot of ups and downs and I had a lot of self-doubt especially at some points but I think if you stay true to your vision and if you are honest with yourself and take pragmatic steps to attaining goals in order to make your vision come alive like the sky is the limit I love that I'm going to let's switch gears because I believe you also fly airplanes and you've developed we're going to do a bunch of demos hopefully you developed an application called fly catcher so perhaps you can tell us about your flying and then you can tell us about this app cuz it's really cool sure so I got into flying planes when when I was about 15 I did a program called the Young Eagles which is a national youth program in my school that I'm sorry in America that gives the youth I think seven to about 16 a free flight in a single engine aircraft and I remember the first time like flying in the back of cesna 152 like feeling extremely enthralled by the entire experience and then I subsequently enrolled in a flight school in Santa Monica in order to get my private pilot license and throughout my journey of becoming a Private Pilot I have um worked on a wide range of cyber security projects in regards to Aviation and one of them I'll be demonstrating today and shooting photos of today is called fly catcher fly catcher is a Raspberry Pi based device I created that uses a SDR a software defined radio called um the Flight Aware SDR that's connected to a central Raspberry Pi device and a 10 90 MHz antenna and what this device does is that it monitors a frequency called adsb standing for automatic dependent surveillance broadcast and what this technology allows is for pilots and groundbased um facilitators called Air Traffic Control in order to keep track of planes as they fly so they can see different attributes of planes such as their air speed their altitude um and other details such as their identification number and this technology is widely used within the aviation Community but it has a wide range of security flaws because it is both unencrypted and unauthenticated meaning that any groundbased hacker could transmit malicious signals on the adsb frequency which is the 1090 MHz frequency in order to transmit malicious or nefarious data and one thing they can do is a scenario called spoofing and spoofing is when a ground groundbased hacker can transmit signals on the adsb frequency making it seem like there are airplanes in the sky that don't exist and we call these ghost aircraft so what this device does is that it monitors the adsb frequency using a software defined radio and uses a on convolutional neural network artificial intelligence model that I coded that's invented in this Raspberry Pi in order to spot and track for these ghost aircraft so what I did was I assembled this device I ran a Flight Aware server on it and I put together a artificial intelligence convolution nail Network embedded within the device in order to track for hacker aircraft so here are a few pictures of it and this is the GitHub repository describing the entire um device you can see the materials I used it's pretty simple used a tfd screen a Raspberry Pi 3B a custom case enclosure um some screws an SDR and a 1090 MHz rubber ducky antenna and then the back end uses python with custom code I created and whenever like an instance of a spoofed aircraft occurs it puts a geom marker um at at that location where the spoofed aircraft was spotted so the AI or the neural network is that running on the Raspberry Pi directly yes okay so you're not running on you're not relying on chat GPT or anything like that you built your own neural network locally and you're just cering that locally right yes I created this device when Chad GPT wasn't as widely used so I custom coded the convolution on neural network model using Python and embedded it on the device that's amazing so most of the code is written in Python i' take it yes that's correct okay so you I believe there's a reason why this is becoming more important something to do with new regulations is that correct yes so a lot of the regulations running Aviation infrastructure is old and although the FAA has released newer versions of adsb they also have a wide range of inherent security issues because the these Technologies especially within the Aerospace and Aviation sectors were not built with security in mind and since they were not built with security in mind they have a lot of like open attack points that hackers can exploit Angelina the the point I'm trying to make is I believe the FAA have got some new regulations perhaps with this and and that's why this is becoming a big issue yes this is becoming a more prevalent issue because the FAA is maning man standing adsb out on all aircraft making it so all aircraft are required to be using this technology that has a lot of open-ended security flaws so I'm assuming that applies to airplanes obviously but does it apply to other devices like drones and things like that as well um from what I know it's mostly airplanes drones use unless like it's a relatively large drone drones use another protocol called open drone ID I mean that's amazing you created an AI neural network running on the Rasberry Pi you built all of the software to find out if someone's spoofing their their their details right um this will help people know if there's like real aircraft around or spoofed aircraft right yes yeah this is a device that's for cyber security researchers and also general aviation professionals to monitor the adsp frequency in order to make sure that there are no spoofed aircraft in the near vicinity so Angelina I've got to ask a question right is it just theoretical or has this actually been spoofed in the past yes there has been instances where aircraft have been spoofed in the past in 2007 a cyber security researcher has demonstrated an attack where he was able to spoof various aircraft into different airspaces within a simulated environment by exploiting this adsb technology and I mean the worry is if I boof an aircraft or say an aircraft is somewhere else rather than where it actually is then I there's potential for collisions right yes attacks on the adsv system can cause a wide range of repercussions such as medier collisions because you can change the geoc coordinates of airplanes confusing other pilots and groundbased facilitators they can get very likely to have collisions midair and I mean the scary part is you said it's unencrypted and unauthenticated yes what makes adsp vulnerable is its unencrypted and unauthenticated nature making it so that any groundbased transmitter can transmit malicious packets into the air that makes it seem like there's aircrafts in the sky that are actually there I mean I'm glad you created this and I think it highlights an issue that um FAA and others need to work on right because I mean if this protocol is unencrypted and unauthenticated and it's simple enough to spoof this it's like a real worry yeah definitely so Angelina this is only the first of many tools that you've written I believe you've done one with satellites right yes that is correct I have created a wide range of Open Source tools within the Aerospace community and one of these tools is sentel sentel is an open- Source command line interface tool that allows you to perform ENT open source Intelligence on satellite systems and what this tool allows you to do is it allows you to input any satellite you want to monitor mix fact information in order to track down where that satellite is with an orbit and this is important specifically for um satellite cers security researchers because in any phase of a satellite attack or satellite security research you're going to begin with reconnaissance and this is an all-in-one package for conducting reconnaissance on satellites so here I have sat Andel pulled up and it's a command line tool so here's the banner and it has four menu options it allows you to track down where the satellite is situated in orbit it lets you also display the Telemetry allows you to also predict when and where the satellite is going to pass overhead of you a lot of satellites occur um during a specific time period because since satellites are continuously orbiting there's only a narrow time range where you can actually communicate with the satellite in order to send packets to it and this tool allows you to coordinate all of that so I'll demonstrate how sentel is able to pull orbital characteristics of a specific satellite so here I'm going to pick menu option one and this gives me two options I can select a satellite from a catalog or I can input a nor Rod catalog ID so I'm going to input a nor Rod catalog ID and input the ID of a satellite each satellite has a identification and using a tool like n2o you can track satellites as they pass through orbit and right now I have the International Space Station pulled up and currently the information has presented on the site is pretty limited um sentel provides a more robust analysis of where a satellite is situated specifically so cyber security researchers can sift through that data so we can see here that the space station has it identification code of 25544 so I'm going to input that into the tool and we can see here it prints out the orbital characteristic information of the International Space Station they'll show you the ethic the motional information such as the first and second derivatives of mean motion the checkum lines alongside the klarian elements klarian elements describe where a satellite is situated with an orbit you can also do things like predict when a satellite is going to pass over ahead of you so I'm going to select menu option three and there's two types of passes visual passes and radio passes visual passes or when you can actually see a satellite passing overhead of you so I'm going to pick that I'm going to input the ISS again 25544 and then I can enter my latitude I'll just enter um arbitrary IP um geoc coordinates hopefully this should work zero enter days of prediction I'll put on 100 so this will print out like basic satellite information and when it's going to pass overhead of you currently it doesn't look like it's going to pass overhead anytime soon but you can also reference other examples where it's able to predict both like Visual and radio passes that's great D what did you write this in I wrote this in goang and how's it is it got like a local database or is it quering something online yeah so it references two apis it references n2o which is the site I just showed and space trck and it uses the data and streamlines the data from the two API sources in order to present this information and the advantage of using this tool is obviously it's command line but it's also gives a lot more detail right yes definitely I would say you can sift through a lot of data on both of those sites and it takes a lot more time in my opinion to look through and reference information on both of those API sources alongside the the custom calculations I do in this tool while with sat Andel you can just do it all within your command line and get all that data pulled up instantly and again this is on your GitHub is that correct yes if you want to check out s inel you can visit the GitHub repository here and it outlines how you can use the tool alongside the capabilities of the tool itself and I mean you're making a lot of this stuff open source is that correct a lot of the work I do is open source mostly because I believe in education I've been doing Aerospace education I've been teaching workshops around Los Angeles and I've been also teaching online workshops where we've catered to people around the world and I really believe in educating others about this issue because when I first started learning about these topics there was hardly any beginner educational materials like I had to S through like 30 Page Long PDF research reports in order to learn this stuff and it was really really tricky and hard for me because I felt like the barrier to entry in order to get this stuff was so difficult and I had to talk to a lot of like really smart people in the industry that were willing to explain to me and luckily enough I had access to people who were willing to explain the technology to me but I understand that not a lot of people were in the same position that I was when I first started so I want to make this stuff more accessible especially for beginners who are just getting started because Aerospace security is a very prevalent issue especially with modern technological infrastructure and the risk and inp security risk affiliated with Aerospace security is growing exponentially every year we're having an exponential rate of satellites being deployed into orbit especially with mega constellations like staring and I really see all the satellite infrastructure is not built with security in mind and that's mostly due to education I'm glad you said that because my next question was going to be okay you've shown us that for aeroplanes unencrypted unauthenticated what a nightmare and what's the stuff like on the satellites is it the same kind of like vulnerabilities very open unsecured Etc I would say a lot of the issues surround with satellite security is also Communications related a lot of the attacks related with satellites are either due to things like spoofing or jamming um starlink has had this issue especially with the Russian UK Ukraine conflict where starlink was just flooded with a lot of spoofing and jamming attacks from ground based transmitters that were trying trying to send malicious commands up to the satellites in order to make sure they do things that they're not supposed to do a very common example of this was with the rosat X-ray satellite this was a joint collaboration between the US and Germany um built I think back in the 70s and this satellite was meant to conduct astronomical research and that entire satellite was compromised when hackers were able to send malicious commands to it via its Communications link and it was able to rotate the solar panels on the satellite in order to face towards the Sun and and that rendered the batteries in the power system of the satellite to fail and it came colliding back into Earth a few years afterwards oh wow so they they basically shifted the solar panel so it couldn't get charged right and then it fell yeah so they shifted the solar panel so it faced directly to the sun and the space environment things get really volatile and like one like angle like tilting a solar panel could um over like charge the batteries and cause like an electrical power outage to occur and that's what happened in that scenario okay so they didn't tilt it away they tilted directly to the yeah and it was like too much power rather than no power yeah so I mean is that a problem right because a lot of the old a lot of satellites I take it have been around for many many years yes yes yeah a lot of satellites were deployed in the 60s or the 70s and pro there's two main problems with old satellites one is the code and the second one is the uh physical components themselves so the code itself is really old and old code is not very secure it's written like 4chan and it was not built with security in mind it was built with the end intentions of in mind which is conducting like either scientific research or some kind of communications based task and cyber security wasn't really an emphasis during those days so they weren't built with security protocols um so we can see with a lot of satellites they're mostly unencrypted so you can most often EES drop into Old satellites in order to get access to information that isn't publicly made accessible and you can also send commands up to those satellites that are then processed which you can use to manipulate the satellite itself and also old satellites use old Communications equipment um making it even more vulnerable because the that kind of equipment was not built with high grade encryption schemes Angelina you mentioned drones so I've got to ask you have you got a project or something related to drones I think you mentioned that you do yes so a few years ago I got my hands on a DJI mini2 which is a commercial drone and I really got into drone photography and I was trying to approach it from a cyber security perspective and trying to find ways I could do cyber security research on it and one thing I explored was digital forensics with DJI drones and one project I worked in regards to that was drone extract which is a comprehensive drone forensics tool created in goang in order to analyze DJI file artifacts in order to figure out whether a drone was used to commit a crime or any kind of like suspicious activity such as voyerism so I created a research article outlined here about some of the research I did did specifically with DJI drones and digital forensics and what I did was I flew around my mini DJI 2 and I tried to analyze as much artifacts I could extract from the SD cards from it and I found a lot of things you of data you could extract just from the SD card located on the Drone so whenever this is like a very blue team kind of tool that allows security researchers to extract the SD card of any drone that commits a crime so for example drones are frequently used to drop off Contraband or drugs at prisons they're also used for spying or for conducting reconnaissance in areas that are restricted if these drones are compromised and researchers are able to get the SD card from it you can dissect a lot of valuable information that can help you pinpoint where the crime was committed so this tool is called drone extract and it contains a wide range of features outlined in this GitHub repository that allows you to conduct comprehensive digital forensics on DJI drones so I have drone extract fold up here I'm going to run it using go and this is what drone extractor looks like and what it allows you to do is conduct a wide range of forensic scenarios so it allows you to parse for files that are specific to DJI drones themselves it also allows you to conduct Telemetry mapping stenography and flight and integrity analysis so I'll be demonstrating how you can uh parse for drone files so I'm going to select one and drones use a wide range of file artifacts in order to store information they can use things like CSV files KML files and GPX files in this case I'll be parsing a CSV file and I have an example of a CSV file that was extracted from a drone so every after every single flight a DJI drone will save a CSV file containing logs of what it did and the problem with these is that it's not very human readable can see it's like a bunch of numbers so what this tool does is it allows you to analyze the CSV file so I'm going to copy the path here and I'm going to paste it and it sifts through all the contents of the CSV file in order to plot what the Drone is doing at the specific instant so I'm going to stop running it but you can see here it's able to extract Telemetry from the Drone such as its geoc coordinates altitude speed distance elevator alongside like power regulation and what a investigator can do in this scenario is do what's called Integrity analysis where they can check for V variations or deviations within each any of these values in order to get evidence of a crime occurring so one metric they can use is looking for like voltage regulation because whenever you have something like a payload drop off or like a Contraband drop off you usually have like an influx of voltage usually there's a like a huge up uptick in voltage when a payload is dropped because the weight of the Drone is reduced so the voltage will go up because suddenly the Drone has a lot more power to operate and this tool contains features in order to do that as well so I can run the tool again and I can go to the fourth option which is flight and integrity analysis I can input this CSV file again and what this does is that it looks through each of the different Telemetry readings so it looks for things like height speed dist mileage voltage and it checks for like specific Optics in it and where whenever there's a lot of like variants or there's a lot of like weird things going on with the data readings it calls it out and it shows it to the investigator in order to look for evidence of crime every DJI is writing all of this stuff even though people aren't aware of it so if I manage to get the SD card like the drone crashes or whatever I get the SD card I can I can read basic basally where where where where it flew a whole bunch of details about the Drone right yeah a lot of commercial drone products are keep keeping track and logging a lot of data whether it's within the SD card itself or within the mobile application you use to control the Drone it's storing and logging all this information even if it's made unaware by the pilot itself can you see where the pilot was or is it only the Drone itself yes you can track down where the pilot was located making it really useful for investigators to track down criminals because it'll show off when where the Drone was deployed and a lot of drones are deployed right next to the pilot itself so in that case you'll be able to track down where relatively the location of the pilot is yeah of course so I mean when the person turns a drone on from that point you've got the data right yes from that instant it starts logging immediately so obviously they're going to fly from themselves and then they most likely were trying to bring the Drone back so you can see obviously if it was a previously successful flight you could see where the person was when they when the Drone came back home yes yeah by tracking the beginning and end points of a flight you could readily figure out where a pilot is located I mean that's great so I mean if they flew over a prison dropping stuff that they shouldn't be um or they were flying over a restricted area uh as long as you've got the SD card you can get that data yes exactly so Angelina you said you programmed or you programm in Fortran and c and like lowlevel languages I believe you've got an A a program or some something that you've written that does something along the lines of C is that is that correct yes so NASA does have some programming standards specifically for C itself and NASA's Jeet propulsion laboratory came up with 10 rules to follow in order to write effective and safe C code to be deployed within space applications and in order to popularize popularize the standard and make it accessible for routine developers like myself to code and see safely I developed a tool that audits through C code and runs it through a couple of compilation programs in order to make sure that the code that is going to be deployed onto either spacecraft or lowlevel Mission projects is safe and ready to go and this is called astr guard the code for astroguard is made accessible on the GitHub repository this is the GitHub repository for astroguard as you can see it is a code auditing and profiling tool based on GCC this is which is a compilation program or C that adheres to NASA's jpo iconic rule of 10 and the rule of 10 is as follows um they're a little bit more complicated but this code handles it all for you so you don't have to really worry about the complexity but includes things like avoiding complex flow constructs such just goto incursion avoiding Heap memory allocation using the pre-processor sparingly and limiting pointer use to single d reference and you can see here it's like a generic shell script that contains code in order to audit through C code and I have a repository here of code Snippets I wrote in C for example this is something that models a violation of rule one so I have like multiple cases here where it violates the rule so rule one is saying avoid complex flow constructs such as goto and recursion and I have things here that violate goto um that violates the rules using go-tos and recursion so this program what it does will it will audit through this entire file and call out whenever there is a violation of the uh NASA JPL rule of 10 so in order to run this I can um give right permissions and then run AST guard and this is using the SN bit I displayed before that violates rule one and what it does is it runs through a wide range of compilation programs such as gcov Lov and GDP which is widely used for um NASA developers it calls out all warnings whenever you're writing like safe code you want to make sure it's as safe as possible so that means there's no margin for errors you want to call out all the warnings and you want to be pedantic about it as possible so this tool does exactly that it's a super annoying tool but it was designed to be annoying um because we wanted to make sure security is always at the Forefront and we're not forgetting anything so it calls out all the issues affiliated with it it'll generate all the warnings it'll also give you the code output and then finally it will give you a line coverage report and I can show you the line coverage report that give you a complete code coverage of the code being analyzed using a tool called l C and it'll give you like the function rate coverage alongside a comprehensive like report for all the functions and lines of code would this as an example help like stop buffer overflow type mistakes yeah pretty much um it follows the JPL standards of writing effective code and those standards are pretty um strict about like memory overflows and other nitpicky things that developers might forget about that but when deployed within like a space setting where it's like really hard to re-update code it's really important to make sure that it's safe and secure so this does all of that auditing beforehand before it just deployed it within a space environment but I mean if I was in an Enterprise or a business it would be helpful if I'm writing in C to run this application to see if I've made some basic mistakes right yes yeah if you want to do like General coverage this tool might be a little bit too intense but yeah it can check for little like basic memory overflows and such next up is a another o tool I created specifically for the aviation industry called sky track and this is a general aviation based tool created for plane spotters and growing up I really liked spotting for airplanes and you can use things such as like adsp exchange or flight radar in order to keep track of aircraft as as you fly however you can't really get a complete like coverage report using only those tools so I wanted to make the tool that streamlined all the data processes behind plane spotting and flight tracking into a open- source tool and this conducts a wide range of reconnaissance on aircraft specifically just by providing in one input so this is the GitHub repository for it and it was written in Python and given the tail number of a airplane so for example I inputed like and November 1 ner 5 Papa Sierra I can get an entire flight report about the airplane at hand using a wide range of apis so I used all these data sources here in order to extract the complete flight coverage report and here are assets of the tool um you can see it's a command line based tool and it has three many options you can extract information about the plane you can generate a comprehensive flight information PDF report and also do tail number to iow conversions and using the tool you can extract relevant information about the plane so I put in an example aircraft called 911 ner 5 papaer and it was able to pull up its registration information the manufacturer information the manufacturer name the model type the registration the engines it uses alongside photos of the actual plane and it also shows a flight history report of the plane itself so when it took off and when it landed so the last time it departed was on that date out of the scene Gabriel Valley Airport and then its duration of flight lasted about 4 minutes and it also generates like an accurate PDF report of the airplane itself containing information such as the manufacturer and the Cal number for the airplane so if I'm if I want to know where an airplane is would this help me do that right yes this tool is specifically meant for um people to find general information about a plane so things such as where airplane is located what airport it departed from what airport it's heading to alongside gen general characteristics of the plane itself such as the manufacturer and the engine type so this could be used for oent I'm assuming yes it's specifically catered to O for airplanes it gets a lot of data from publicly open source tools and it streamlines that data um to be used for tracking purposes so that's great I mean your other tool the SAT Intel that's also like an ocean tool but that's for satellites and then this is for planes right yes this is like the airplane version of sat Andel so it conducts um wide range allend on airplanes instead of satellites and the advantage of the tool over like the other tools out there is that it it makes it a lot simpler and it gives you a lot more data more easily right yes if you did not have that tool you'll have to sift through at least 10 different websites in order to get all that comprehensive information about a plane but that tool allows you to get all that data within a few seconds and I mean you are you just leveraging apis on various sites yes yeah it's a Python program that consolidates the data from a wide range of apis and makes it maure for the user the see I love these tools I mean it's I love the fact that it's command line and it's so quick right yeah um and you're making you're saving people a lot of time rather than like I mean guey is pretty and nice but it it takes a lot of time and you're leveraging those apis from all these different websites to literally just give you that information very very quickly it's very nice yeah yeah a lot of these tools were me meant to streamline the processes I had to go through because when I was conducting research I had to spend so much time looking for various data sources and figuring out which data sources were valid and like how I can extract and web script the data in order to automate the process and that took forever on my end and I didn't want other Aerospace researchers to go through that process especially if they're trying to conduct high grade technical research they shouldn't be spending hour hours and hour sifting from data sets they should have automatic access to the data so they can do what they do best which is research Ang jelina AI is All the Rage of the day so have you got like another like cool tool that leverages AI perhaps yes um some of my recent cyber security initiatives have been centered around Ai and how AI can be used both for offensive and defensive purposes and one open source tool I have developed centered around AI for cyber is called payload wizard payloadz wizard is hosted on this website here and what it is is an advanced AI assistant that uses GPT language models in order to interpret and generate cyber security payloads so it has two main features it has generation capabilities and interpretation capability so we can first begin with generation and here we can input any like end goal of a payload so here I have a input of creative payload that conducts intrusion detection on Windows registry access by monitoring Mac ID and IP addresses and here I can select from a wide range of languages I want the payload to be processed in so I selected Python and you can click generate payload and it will generate the code for you automatically and then once the code is generated you can copy the code and utilize it within your own payload so it's before as a developer you have to write hundreds of lines of code in order to create a payload for siphoning data or creating an exploit but this does it for you automatically so if I understand right you're just using human readable language on the left hand side like just talking to chat GPT or something and then it generates it to yeah it's exactly like talking to chat gbt but the difference is that this is prompt engineering this went through a series of prompt engineering attempt so you won't get any like BS results where like you know sometimes chat GPD is pretty redundant or like it doesn't really give you exactly what it does this gets straight to the point for cyber security purposes so it's like a GPT um assistant um completely calibrated to make cyber security payload and is this using chat GPT on the back end yes it's using open API open ai's um API in the back end and calling GPT with specific prompt inputs in order to get the output so I mean the first thing you can do is generate code yes and then can also interpret code is that right yes it this tool can also interpret code so we can do that by going to pad interpreter and here I have an example script that I wrote a few years ago this uses ducky script is an esoteric payload language used by a wide range of hack five tools and hack five has a tool called the USB rubber ducky which is a hid device for keystroke injection attacks and this is a payload I wrote In order to make like a digital rain um animation appear on any computer and like a beginner getting into this who is unfamiliar with the ducky script language or the syntax of the language might have a hard time interpreting what exactly this payload does so this is meant for any like beginner to uh payload language or anyone who hasn't really messed around or like dissected the payload themselves in order to quickly figure out what each of the lines are doing so here the payload interpreter um interprets the payload I inputed here with the ducky script payload and it explains to me step by step what exactly the payload is doing so for example the first line gooey space says it's mimicking the space key on the gooey interface it also explains like here delay 100 is waits for 100 milliseconds because when you're first experimenting with payloads you might not know like slight nuances for example a person might be able to figure out what delay does but 100 what does that mean 100 seconds 100 minutes 100 milliseconds so this like clarifies all the nuances does it only support uh like ducky script type stuff or is it like a multiple languages multiple languages so if I dropped a python script in there' be able to tell me what's going on yes and see languages like that is there any sort of like uh restrictions or like try and see what see I mean it's pushing it to chat gbd so hopefully he'll be able to interpret it right yeah yeah it was especially with a prompt engineer inputs it should be able to interpret the payload if not you can submit an issue on the GitHub repository and I'll get to it have you got any cool examples of this of where this has been used yeah I mean I I've used this for a wide range of like payload interpration so I usually use a lot of payloads um hosted on the hack five like payload catalog I don't know if you've seen it before but usually like sometimes since they're open source and created by other developers I have a hard time understanding what EX does especially if they use this a covert mechanism in order to like siphon or do something to the file system I don't really understand so I just use this tool as an extra step in order to um delineate what a payload is doing and get a high higher level overview of what the payload is doing so I don't spend too much time trying to figure it out I mean that's great I mean I agree it's like there's a lot of cool payloads out there that have been written by some really clever clever people but it's difficult to understand what the action doing half the time if you're not familiar so this is great and jelina when I was doing the research for this and I looked at what you accomplished by 18 it's like wow unbelievable so I mean huge congratulations and really appreciate you know that you sharing this and inspiring others but I got to ask you some questions like career-wise um and like languages so let's start with what you've been coding for over a decade what's your what would you recommend as the first programming language if you were getting into cyber security and want to learn one programming language to begin with I would highly recommend python mostly because it's a highle language so the syntax is pretty easy to read through especially if you're a beginner and it goes over a lot of rudimentary programming Concepts in a very simple and intuitive and readable way and also a lot of cyber security tools and open source tools are written in Python and it also has a huge developer support community so whenever you're having an issue or want to write a tool yourself you can get a lot of support and Community backing behind it mean you're 18 you I'm I'm taking it you don't have a degree yet or you're busy with a degree is that is that right yeah so I just graduated from high school I graduated from high school a few weeks ago um that was a completely mind-blowing experience for me um and now you mean because you didn't think you were going to graduate or yeah it just felt like in the beginning I it just felt like oh it's going to be four years it's going to take forever and you know there was like a lot of bums and Hills along the way some of high school and I got into trouble a few times at my school for hacking a couple of things so oh you got you got to tell us about that because I mean I mean share what you can because that's you know I think what I like to say a lot is a lot of people complain about some of the videos on YouTube that I put out but it's I think a lot of hackers or a lot of cyber Security Professionals start that way they do something at school but I mean the point is now that you've graduated you are producing a lot of Blue Team Tools yeah and you're working in cybercity already so sorry I I didn't want to interrupt but perhaps you can tell us a bit of the stories if you can of what happened yeah so a few of the hacks I coordinated throughout my middle school and high school years were the first one I did was when I was in sixth grade where we would use cahoot in order to memorize terms for Spanish classes and I would just bot create my own bot spanners in order to spam all the cahoot games and that was a lot of fun for me um not only WR the code that was capable of spamming um cahoot games and making all the classmates laugh I always loved pulling light-hearted jokes in class even if I got in trouble for it it was like why not um school's pretty boring for me so I was like I I would I really lik any kind of like humor I could embed within the lectures um even if it was not intended by the teachers um another hack I did was with a digital scoreboard so every year in high school there's this homecoming game where there's a digital scoreboard that gives each um class grade so like freshman sophomore junior seniors their own scores and we would do activities throughout the week during Homecoming in order to like improve our scores and it was using a digital infrastructure and a software so one year um I was a sophomore I hacked into the scoreboard itself and made the sophomores appear on top and um I got a lot of behem responses from the seniors because it was like tradition to have the seniors win every single year but um just the sophomores ended up winning because the scoreboard was hacked so lighthearted pranks like that I would P all the time and it really helped me learn the infrastructure behind the Technologies I would exploit and it was a lot of fun um and most I didn't really have any serious in structure was like silly stuff like homecoming game scoreboards or like a hoot games but it was a great leeway for me to really explore the fun sides like the thrilling adrenaline spiking sides of cyber security I love that so just coming back to my original question you haven't got a degree yet but you studying I think you're you you've just started is that right or you going to start soon yes I'm going to be doing an degree in electrical engineering with a minor in Aerospace at Caltech I'm going to be taking a gap year this year in order to travel the world I want to be teaching kids internationally and nationally about computer science and electronics before I really settle down and pursue my degree I'm also going to be working on a cyber security startup during my Gap year but after this year I'm going to be studying at keltech which is in Pasadena um specifically focusing on creating photonics systems or s transceivers I love that I I think the inspiration there is that you don't need a degree to start I mean you started when you were seven so anyone can start there's nothing limiting you from starting to code and starting to get into cyber security yeah especially with the internet now and there's a plora of accessible um tools and guidelines on the internet for you to get involved so I think the only two things you need are your mind and your passion and those two things will lead you wherever you want to go I'm not sure if you can talk about this but I'd be really interested because I've interviewed other people who have been hacking when they were younger um what did your mom say about all these activities that you were getting up to frankly like my my family doesn't really have a lot of interest in what I do unless it directly affects them um they've always considered me as like this nerdy computer person so they don't really treat me special or they treat me like a human being which is exactly the way I want to be treated um although it might not seem typical Behavior for a lot of I don't know like average households it's the way they've always perceived me as and they like me for real I am and I really appreciate that but there are some moments where they have been concerned or off-put it by some of my Shenanigans for example I created a ESP a266 based deauthentication device that I was um testing out at my house that disconnected all the um devices connected to my House's Wi-Fi that caused a lot of disruptance is and caused my family to point fingers at me um of course and there's been like a few like instances with like Hardware haing or like developing like electronic based tools for example I created a iot based lamp device when I was I think 12 years old and when I was making this um iot lamp device I was soldering it to a relay and I was asking my brother to help me solder it together and I forgot the power source was plugged in to like an 120 volt power source and I was asking my brother to help me um solder together and then he accidentally got electrocuted which was completely my fault um like thank God it was just like a slight jolt but um yeah my family has definitely um been pulled into a few rabbit holes by some of my Shenanigans how old were you when you made the de author I was 13 I love that I mean I think the great thing about the world today right is if you if you've got an interest in cyber security there's no like we said right in the beginning there's no like age thing yeah doesn't matter if you're young doesn't matter if you're all just do it all the information's out there there people like you that are putting out code making it freely available so what's to stop you right yeah definitely another thing is like I know cyber security can have a lot of like esoteric or technical terms that might entice kids to stay away from it because I remember like one of the pain points when I started cyber security was like oh I will never understand this because look at all these words I don't understand what they mean but a lot of these underlying principles Behind these tools are very simple and once you understand the underlying principles of it you can pretty much build any like open source project or any tool that leverages off of those principles so don't let like technical papers or like I don't know people or like guides that use super technical terms disuade you from pursuing your own projects because the espa 266 Steve offer was just a few soldering connections and lines of sea that were not too difficult and I think any 13 year old has the wherewithall to make a project like that as long as they stay motivated do you have any certifications or is it all just selfstudy it was mostly self-study yeah um what I would do was for programming I would purchase a bunch of textbooks off of Amazon and every single morning when I was in Middle School I would wake up at 400 a.m. and just pound those techbook textbooks every single day I would have my laptop on the side and a huge like textbook I started off with like JavaScript and then moved on to Java but every month or so I would go through a book on a programming language I wanted to learn and do projects and that's what really helped consolidate my skill set so let me see understood that right you were waking up at 4:00 in the morning to study before school and then you were spending as much of your free time as you could like studying the stuff is that right yes I was really passionate about the stuff and you know like a lot of the kids although I wish I had more of a social life in middle school they weren't really talking about really interesting stuff like a lot of the girls in my grades were talking about like boys they were interested in or like I don't know what they were doing over the weekend and that wasn't really enticing to me I thought programming was a lot more fascinating and although I did miss out on a few experiences in my childhood because of that I don't think I would have sacrificed my programming expertise for that because I really was passionate about computers and I'll never let any external influences dissuade me from my passion I think it's so important I love to hear it when young people have a a drive and a passion and they follow it and they don't let naysayers or people stop them from doing that don't let other you know people who have no idea from stopping them you know it's your life if you've got that passion then go for it yeah definitely and especially for young people it might be a little bit more difficult to do that because you know like especially in middle school it's all about like what do other people in my community think of me because you go to school every single day with the same group of people so it's all about like what the S person thing it be and what to those group yeah friends think of me but in the wide scheme of things and once you go into the professional world one human ship was like I completely got a huge perspective on like how big the world is because like when you're in middle school or when you're in high school you go to the same place every single day and your perspective of the world is a lot more tunnel vision and narrowed but once you enter the professional atmosphere you actually really understand how big the world is and how many researchers are working on different stuff and it it becomes really interesting and I was very fortunate enough to get a slight taste of that when I was in high school where I was working and collaborating with a lot of researchers um that were older than me and in the professional sectors but it really helped expand my perspectives of the different initiatives so being worked on and diversity of those initiatives and how different people can leverage different skill sets and their experiences in order to build cool creative projects so Angelina we've been going for a while I love your story I could keep you here for hours but I suppose we have to wrap it up sometime do you have any last words or encouragement for people especially younger people who want to get into S one piece of advice I have for anyone entering cyber security or any kind of technical Endeavor is to try to find your own personal Flow State that allows you to intertwine discipline and creativity I think a lot of people especially when they enter cyber or computer science are very limited in regards to perspective like I think the world thinks of computer science and cyber security as very technical you and not as a creative discipline but I think there are ways you can interwine your own personal creativity and your own personal ideas into your research or into programs you right and I think programming is as just as Pro creative as it is Technical and it's about finding that discipline but finding that Nexus between Tech technicality and creativity or Define your Flow State and for me whenever I'm running a program I'm like a child like I think a lot of my programming and a lot of the work I do can be termed as childish because I'm exploring I'm imagining I'm literally doing what I did when I was a kid when I was like building Lego sets it's like the exact same kind of mind mindset and algorithms I going just within a different atmosphere and that really helps me produce my best work because I'm not constantly worried about the technical output I'm producing but I'm always focusing on the the process itself and finding myself throughout the process and I think I'm just as much as of an artist as I am a programmer or a cyber security researcher there is definitely an art to development and an art to cyber security research and it's about a process of discovering yourself as you do your work and finding ways you can embed your own values through the work you output into the world and by doing that you'll produce something novel and that contri contributes a lot more to society and a lot more to research communities than it does um compared to like stale research if you don't have that creative element to you you're just going to produce stale research that isn't really enticing or doesn't get the idea across because in order to produce high-r technical research you need to not only communicate um but also make it enticing for the people who are looking at your research so you you need to find that perfect balance between techn ity and the artistic element behind the technical work that you do and I think a lot of that is missing within the industry and I think I'm going to be trying my best throughout the years to um Express how like technology can be a sign of expression not just a technical means to an nend Angelina thanks so much for sharing and thanks so much for being an inspiration especially to the Next Generation I love that you even at 18 have accomplish so much and can be an encouragement to people who are perhaps 10 years younger than you thanks so much for sharing thank you so much for having me on the show David it's an honor to be here thank you so much",

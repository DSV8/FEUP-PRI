    "transcript": "(upbeat music) - Okay, here we go. (bouncy upbeat music) So here we are, we are with the new Apple Watch. This is the ultra version, it's honestly so impressive. When I saw the event, I was kind of like, \"Oh man, it looks a little big, it looks a little heavy.\" It's surprisingly very light, it's actually made of titanium and ceramic. They have additional speaker, which is actually pretty great because they have this new feature when you press the Action button, which there's a new button right here which will allow you to set different actions when you press it. But when you hold the Action button, it'll actually let out a pretty high decibel sound. So if you are on a trail and you need help, this will allow you to be able to alert the authorities. It also, of course, has our digital crown, which is much larger than the previous version. And it also has a really cool night mode, so when you scroll the digital crown down it'll turn into this nice night mode. So everything will turn red, so it'll be very easy on your eyes and it'll remove all of the blue light from that. Thank you, good to see you. - [Tim] Good to see you. - That's him. So now with the Apple Watch Ultra in the Series 8 they have temperature sensor, which is so incredible, for not only tracking your cycle, but for ovulation. As a woman, this is something that is so exciting, I've been using the Oura Ring for the past, wow, like over a year. And because it has the temperature sensing it has been so accurate to predict periods, so everyone with the period, high five to us. we're gonna now have more accurate predictions which is so exciting. Another thing that I think is cool is this display, is it's a flat display, it's also super resistant and the flat display makes it so much easier to be able to scroll and use. So I feel like if you're out in the middle of nowhere, it's way easier to press the buttons and stuff on the display. The other thing that's also interesting, which I don't think I'll be testing out because I am not a very good swimmer, but this has a dive mode. So basically when you dive, it'll automatically detect that you're diving, and it'll give you the water temperature, it'll show you how far you're diving, and that's pretty awesome. Maybe I'll get scuba certified because of the Apple Watch Ultra. I don't know, it's a possibility. I just thought I would try them on just to see how they look, how they feel. So this is the Ocean Loop band, this is the Trail Band. The crazy thing is like they do look pretty large, but it's light, like it's not a heavy feel, and I think that this Trail Loop band probably fits the best 'cause it keeps it nice and snug. This I feel like is a little bit loose on my arm, so I probably wouldn't go with this one. Thankfully I don't really go in the ocean, so we won't need to worry about that. So it has 36 hours of battery life, which is pretty impressive, especially for a watch like this, which makes sense because it is much larger. There's gonna be a new optimization that's coming out in the fall, and you'll be able to actually get 60 hours, which is kind of cool because if you are out in the middle of nowhere to be able to have that added battery life is pretty awesome. This also has the precision dual frequency GPS, which would be super helpful because even when I'm downtown, it's really hard to sometimes get GPS signals. So if you are out in the middle of nowhere, or you're doing a marathon or something, and you're running in areas where you need precise location this will definitely aid with that. Something else really cool that they added in the new Ultra and the Series 8 is Crash Detection, so if you unfortunately find yourself in a car crash you'll be able to alert authorities immediately to get help, and that's honestly something that is so cool. And during the event they always show these Apple Watch stories, and they're so touching, and it's so incredible to see how this device has helped so many people and it saved so many lives. I definitely think that this is built for the action sports person in mind, but hey, who's to say that the everyday person can't enjoy the Apple Watch Ultra 'cause I know I'm definitely pre-ordering. The Apple Watch Ultra is available for 799, and this was just a first look of it here at the Apple Event today. Thank you guys so much for watching, I will see you guys in my next video. Like, comment, subscribe, and I have more Apple videos coming very, very shortly, if they're not out already. Check 'em out here, here, or here, bye. (upbeat music) - Hey! Hello, hello, how are you? - So nice to finally meet you in person. - I was like, wait, we've met, and I'm like, no, actually we haven't. Looking peachy! - We just saw each other. - Hey. - And I was like, wait, I just saw you like a couple days ago. Just say hi to my Vlog. - Hey, how you doing? It's me.",

    "transcript": "well hello people you know I'm all about dual purpose headphones utilizing them for movies entertainment music and of course gaming you know we review so many gaming headsets that I see so often people commenting why not just get a proper headphone that you get better audio quality most of the time better comfort and build quality instead of a gaming headset that have all the add-on gimmicky features and so that is exactly what we're talking about today because I have the Massdrop Sennheiser HD58X Jubilee headphone and that is a fantastic value that I'm sure will be a great addition for your gaming setup let me tell you why right after this the new t46 caliber ddr4 memory is one unique RGB kit with awesome light spill from each module and the special edition has a cool totem design on the light bar you get lifetime warranty up to 4,000 megahertz speeds and full lighting control through the software check out the t4 6 caliber Ram down below oh man it is hot in here but not as hot as these headphones I love the HD58X Jubilee because the value is absolutely incredible $150 for a pair that sounds this good that looks this good that are so comfortable I mean you know I'm fanboying all over this pair but you know I've been using the HD6XX as kind of like my primary headset I even have the mod mic attachment on here because this is my favorite pair aside when I'm not using actual headsets for gaming but the HD58X index is based off similar design as the HD6XX one of the things I absolutely love about the ear cups is this internal mesh it's super soft so in case your ears do enter all the way inside the ear cup and they do make contact with that internal wall no issues with plastic hitting your ears so absolutely love this design now one of the reasons why I say this headphone is a fantastic value is because many members of the audio enthusiast community are referencing the sound signature of this headphone to be very similar to the Sennheiser HD660S which is a $500 pair and this thing is only 150 bucks so you can check out the drop down below now from a build quality perspective they're mainly plastic which is great because they're lightweight with some metal pieces where they matter but the frame structure here is based on the HD6XX which I have carried in my backpack they've gotten squished with gear and over time they've held up really well no issues so I'm feeling continent in the HD58X Jubilee as well now the thing I love about open-back headphones is the fact that you ears breathe so if you're in a gaming match for six hours you know you have those marathons absolutely no problem with any sort of heat accumulation no sweat whatsoever unless you're like physically sweating but not from the headphone now obviously one thing to keep in mind with this open back nature is that there is sound leak so this is not for public spaces this is for like home use for quiet environment and also you can definitely hear everything that's coming into the headset so something to keep in mind but with higher enough volume it completely shuts everything out audio wise from your external environment and is never an issue so then why would you get something like this for gaming going with the gaming headset you get a microphone but ask yourself how many games have you played in last month that actually requires a microphone sure for some multiplayer games csgo this is why this is here so I can communicate with my teammates but basically for majority of all my other gaming sessions I wear either the 58X Jubilee or my HD6XX for that matter and so it kind of makes me think if you do have already a headset potentially just for the microphone so you can put these on and put the other thing over like this so you can still have microphone but receive much better audio quality from an actually good sounding pair obviously this looks a bit ridiculous but you can fashion other accessories if you require microphone for your gaming sessions but I would say for like 90 percent of the games that I play are in single-player so I don't require microphone to communicate with those BOTS so I choose something like this and so what is it like gaming with the Jubilee it is an audio file pair that is super cheap and they're using sanitizers new drivers which are 150 ohms so you can totally try them with your smartphone I have plenty of volume from the 1 plus 6 for this pair and I normally plug all my headsets and audio stuff directly into my motherboard because onboard audio is becoming so good and I actually did a little bit of a comparison between my lovely the element amp from JD's labs and my onboard audio on my Asus motherboard we can check out that video here so I used both motherboard and my amp to test out these and the results are incredible the open back nature of this headset really delivers that really nice positional awareness of your environment even better than a GSP 500 which is an open back headset and has really good enriched definition and fantastic base with these the entire soundstage is like slightly bigger but without losing any detail and preserving like all the sound cues that you'd want to hear like you know in csgo if if flash goes off on site b-but you're inside a you're somewhere in the middle you can sense that distance if you play the maps it's a really weird feeling replaying some of my most recent games and just hearing the audio in a completely different way because these are just so clean and they have no overpowered bass the mid-range is fantastic they are slightly higher on the mid on the treble versus the HD6XX and I think the bass here is like slightly boosted as well but I would say that's actually pretty decent sound signature for gaming because you want to have enough treble that is not harsh so you want to maintain all the detail you want to have a little bit of body in the bass so that things don't sound too flat and I think the HD58X kind of delivers in that respect perfectly for games like quake champions where there's a lot of vertical movement so if you hear anybody above you you can anticipate their movement if you have good map knowledge and know which corridors lead to where these this whole like audio definition is just like a really good way to give you an advantage in gaming if you are not just after the visual side of things but after you're the audio side of things as well if you have not yet played squad I highly recommended the amount of power in any gunfight and like rocket launchers and just like 50 caliber it sounds incredible here just sounds like something is literally flying right beside you where you are as a character in game and that's something that you definitely need to experience especially when it comes to this like open environment through the HD58X it's so nice and then there's hell blades annual sacrifice a game that has such interesting audio characteristics that I knew about that and I kind of saved it for good set of headphones I'm so happy I did because like hearing voices behind you in front of you and like having this kind of whispering thing that's inside the game but it feels like it's right here it's creepy but it's also delivers such good game design that like really immerses you into that environment and something that I haven't been able to recreate with other pairs with the GSP 500 yes but with the HD58X it's a little bit of a different feeling because it's slightly more open and not there's like enclosed inside the headset there'll be no more stories after this one it's over $150 this is a fantastic pair for games if you want to experience like really clean not too bass heavy not too harsh treble but just enough detail so you can pinpoint everything and like just consume the audio as the way it's meant to be consumed with a little bit of sparkle I would highly recommend the HD58X the thing is you know I prefer like more fun signatures so I prefer my lower and slightly beefier which is why I replaced the ear cups on the GSP 500 to the leather ones so they maintain a little bit more of that bass but it's so refreshing to come back to something like this that is flatter but without losing character so it's a different sounding signature versus what you get with like typical gaming headsets and obviously kind of self-explanatory but if you're not into gaming this is a fantastic pair for movies and music just really clean analytical bright extension that is just fantastic for trance music good for rock you know for hip-hop you probably want a little bit more bass something a little bit heavier in there but they still deliver in that bass Department not to be sounding too flat and still having a lot of character that you'll still be pumping your head so yeah pretty happy with how these deliver not just for games but for the overall genre of audio that might pass to your ears and like I said earlier if you require microphone add an attachment Slyke mod mic is quite popular for headphones of this caliber also going with like an external USB microphone maybe or if you already have a headset potentially just use that microphone and a different pair for your audio needs so you get best of both worlds alright so that's it for the HD58X Jubilee it is definitely going to be staying on my desk as part of my head highly recommended check out the job below also check out this other relevant content don't forget to subscribe to our new boot sequence channel and that yeah I'll see you in the next video",

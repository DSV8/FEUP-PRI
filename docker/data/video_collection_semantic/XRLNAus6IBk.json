everybody what's happening we're gonna be taking phone calls like i said before and we're gonna be talking about the exploding batteries on a note 7 funny enough i'm actually broadcasting it may very well explode here hahaha while we're recording this in the studio but we are gonna talk about exploding batteries whether you c are or not (phone continues ringing in background) we are also gonna talk about the upcoming video in my pants. ok that's coming out we're gonna probably have an announcement here on the no not probably we definitely are having an announcement on i believe the seventh of september's so this week ok now let's let's go ahead let's let some people in I'm gonna let you on the phone lines but make sure to bring the heat ok so here we go I'm gonna go my own accord hello hello hey who's this only from rock this is on box there you have it going my friend how's your cool cool that's right and here you are now your live as well i gotta i just realized i gotta turn off call waiting because it's going crazy here let's get your quick let's get your comment or question real quick you have a question or you want to make a comment on the iphone 7 is coming out or the exploding battery on the note 7 question or comment 0 for my colorful cool Carlos llorca father right yes it is it's very cool everybody's pumped up now to you is this something that you're gonna want to buy are you what what feature you excited about is it the dual camera lenses loculi sorry say that again talking about i know you would definitely buy ok I'm gonna let you go because I have to turn off call waiting on this thing because we're getting some crazy call-waiting you thank you for calling in ok more phone calls in a moment folks I gotta turn off call waiting here real quick and I'm on this this phone years we're gonna have to find a way here hahahahahah have to find a way here to turn off call waiting because a crazy number of calls are coming through now let's just see here how to do that on an iphone before this iphone completely breaks okay settings this is something i should have been prepared for obviously but it's imperative of course to turn off call waiting when you're doing something like this right here we go our general phone okay I'm gonna have this in a moment alright so one second please stop calling me here call waiting area ok so we call waiting is off ok cool so we're not going to get beat like crazy when the next phone call comes through so go ahead call in with your next line let's see what's going on let's see who's here hello ok this is lu han you just for some reason you're not going through bluetooth anymore let me just see something are you still on the line my goodness okay we gotta just all that we break we may have broken you know what i think is breaking this iphone is a pic this iphone is busted from facetime its face time that is breaking this thing here let's try again hello please lay off the facetime let's just go with old-school calls here please oh this is busted this is busted we may need to do a quick switch sim card switch here into another device because I think facetime has broke has broken the poor iphone i'm going to show you the bottom i'm going to show you the top of the display but if I show you the bottom here you can see that i can text this out I can't get out because of facetime facetime broke the show so i'm going to extract this i'm going to extract this sim card here put into a different device something of course it doesn't have while the phone is so hot right now Oh taking calls like crazy okay I'm gonna take this sim card out now a lot of people recommended that i use the burner app man the burner apples was really finicky I was a trying to barter with some calls and having some problems so it's a really unique set of circumstances here when it comes to you know when it comes to doing these mega calling shows because it's not like a usual application where you know where you're getting a small volume of calls this is an enormous volume of calls you're gonna get in here and so I guess it should be expected that your average device isn't really going to work alright so i gotta get a different phone actually I was going to just put it in my phone and I realized how much of a nightmare that would be for my notifications my notifications we just right give me one moment I'll be back I promise you okay one second another device once yeah yeah okay folks I know you're upset and I appreciate that I've got the ZTE acts on over here and we're going to have to make do right now now hopefully with the absence of facetime oh hello there mr. look at that look at that beauty I'm with the absence of face time I think we should be golden now oh one thing i wanted to mention based on the last time that I did this is that a lot of people were upset that they actually missed the broadcast i'm guessing phone calls going to come in like crazy right here a lot of people were upset that they missed the broadcast yeah and so my recommendation here is to turn on your notifications for my channel that little bell on mobile then you won't miss any of these broadcast will be first to know and you can get a shot at calling in and having a chat so this says no service here let's just see what's going on don't worry we're gonna be taking phone calls again in a moment the iphone terrible idea you know why because facetime pretty much broke the it pretty much broke the device that you guys that were requesting facetime you shut this thing down it was completely impossible to answer it now as my father should have had should also had the should have also had to call waiting turned off and that is the first thing I'm going to do on this fun radio we're already getting calls coming in here ok so first things first hi you guys are probably going to kill me with the text and everything as well so let's just get this set to where you at i'm going to do no not airplane i just want to do not disturb where are you at do not disturb okay hold up hold up on the phone calls for a minute haha this is something saying do not disturb you got this slightly different layout over here no call me yet don't call me yet please don't keep calling me yet frequently used sound and vibration do not disturb I don't want to do this update right now ok always do not disturb is now on okay next thing is to turn off call waiting because that becomes a major headache as you experienced khan the last one are ye i hope you guys can hear me ok I don't have any kind of special microphone just speaking into the phone uh you know what let me know on Twitter if you guys can hear me properly at all ok so next up is what was i doing I was a turning off call waiting now that's not a thing that i normally do but where is let's see apologies guys I'm gonna get this down i'm gonna get a system here so we know what works and what doesn't work what you really after do this a few times to figure out the best way if you know what I'm saying so should be called sitting somewhere here mmm course all the settings where you at here we go get trust me we're taking phone calls and I told you we're gonna be talking about the exploding note 7 in the upcoming iphone 7 that's our agenda for today if we have one if we ever get there by I'm telling him try my best here call waiting is in the call settings but where the hell are the call settings here sound and vibration mm alright let's just take a call let's just take a call and see maybe the call waiting will be so bothersome hello hello anybody there hello all that person hung up they didn't expect me to answer it ah yeah well trust me if you call me i'm going to answer it all right here we go hello they hung up to maybe we broke this device as well maybe it wasn't meant to be voc hopefully its person sticks around holy smokes hello oh hey we got a winning color today you have won an all-expenses-paid cruise to the Bahamas how's it going man you have that the last that racket what's happening right now yeah man listen to calls were coming in like hot fire they were coming in one after the other yours made it through was trying to turn off all these different features because i had it set up on the iphone at first and was getting absolutely bombarded with facetime request it the whole phone was catching fire i had to shut that down so now we're on ZTE and things looked to be working working property walking you know I had my macbook already my phone writing my google voice ready all all battling it out one got it well you you sound like a professional my friend I'm proud of you sound like a proper unboxtherapy viewer or I definitely love me although night and hear my question for you what do you think about the new macbook that's coming in a couple months do any thoughts on that oh well I definitely gonna pick it up i have a you know I macbook owner for a long time now currently in in my inventory of macbooks I've got a macbook pro I have loved the 12-inch MacBook i have the old 11-inch macbook air and i got an a- got an old-school macbook pro that i put like my own ssds into so I pretty much get every generation of the macbook and macbook pro so this new one I mean I saw the rumored oled display panel on there and and that looks that looks pretty badass I mean to be honest with you the the the current design is just a little bit stale I mean it's been out for a long time so it'll be interesting to see how they date take a different approach at the Pro and maybe make it thinner maybe make it a little bit more portable so I mean you can bet your boots that i'll be picking one up all right here like a pallbearer the aircraft um you know it's so hard to say if you can only have one if I could only have one I would definitely take the pro just because I do so much video work and having an extra horsepower is just super helpful when you need it but that said if I didn't work in video and it was strictly for productivity it might be a little bit overkill so it really depends on the usage scenario right and-and-and first for some people that are that are just typing emails and using it as a student they might not to speak and they might need to spend the extra cash and carry the extra weight of the pro but for me it will be a pro com alright do you know I don't hold back to other people are waiting patiently crazy and no worries dude thanks for calling in ok so cool I guess call-waiting it looks like call waiting was off by default there because we didn't get interrupted during the phone call which I appreciated that or we have another broken phone no we don't ok cool so it turns out that it looks like the ZTE is the way to go on our call in phone for the calling show hello hey I what is happening my friend you got through oh my god hmm why rush to the phone i have a notification i'll come up it's amazing it's hard to believe here we are after all this time are chatting to one another just like a couple of buddies that's gonna be weird I got your video playing right here because that is weird it's like some kind of weird inception or something about that guy hot guy that was the last guy yeah so there's a bit of a delay it's a very slim delay but it's a but it's a very cool new app new function within the app it's being sort of rolled out in a bit in a very slow way to test it out but uh this is one of the biggest experiment so far so this entire broadcast is actually running off of a note 7 right now now which has been out which hasn't exploded yet and uh and i'm hoping to do this frequently I think it's a really cool way to connect with people in show the world that that you guys are you guys are real you know you're not just like some some view count or something like that but anyways today we're talking about and I at least want to have some sort of a topic here so your choice would you rather give your opinion on the exploding note 7 battery or the upcoming iphone 7 which which is more spicy for you the iphone ok alright so let me know let me know your thoughts what do you what do you think about it will you buy it are you excited are you lukewarm what are your thoughts I personally will not buy it I mean everything i'll probably online a lot of videos about it said that super good are compared to like changes from like five for the 60 the six because it's not gonna be you know they were better than the changes from the success of the seven right I personally don't buy everything life only comes out i have accepted it was like the success from the farm actually that was awesome i had so five shoes all together right the headphone jack alright doesn't want us to confirm thing about what we're gonna come in the box I don't know the last honestly the last rumors that i saw said that the somebody had a picture of a box which had the the contents and it looks like there's going to be at least according to that there's going to be an adapter for 3.5 millimeter and then and then there also might be a there also might be some earpods that use the Lightning port so I don't know if either of those things sort of solve the issue because as you know with adapters is the kind of situation where they never with you when you need them to be you know like you're on an airplane and you're like damn I left that adapter at home so they're there goes using this this last-minute headset but I think I think the agenda here is the kind of push individuals into using wireless headphones and it's obvious it's obvious to see what they're doing but I think you know I think a lot of people are going to share your sentiment but at the same time it's like I think so many people are just used to always getting the new iphone and you know Apple is going to show off some magical thing regarding the dual lens system and I think it's gonna it's gonna get those same individuals hyped up but i agree with you i really don't think I really don't think that at this point in time there's much of a need for your average person your average user of technology to be upgrading to every single device it's kind of it's kind of ridiculous from an economic perspective considering how good so many phones are now I've always you know I've been growing up iphones the first smartphone wasn't iphone and I've never had someone senior your axon videos i loved ones are you just get iphone bird haha smart homes like you and don't look really nice of always look like them you know so maybe this whole break gotta know yeah it's honestly honestly dude I think I feel like the new the new optimal price point for smartphones is somewhere in like the three to four hundred dollar rage what you're like value value for money in that range right now is absolutely insane like I mean the phone that we're talking on right now right now is the new axon and it's like yeah and it's like man you look at the complete package and you start to wonder how it is that the market leaders are selling their products at twice the price somebody's making money and somebody isn't you know that became plate like this it seems pretty obvious but yeah and needless to say obviously these new startup companies aren't going to not start ups but like new to the north american market they're not going to have the advantages of the other guys from a marketing perspective so your average person on the street is not isn't even going to know what these devices are but for somebody somebody who's more of an enthusiast this certainly value to be had in a lot of the cool lifted the emerging budget android devices that are out there for yahoo com ya know you're not gonna see one in the wild anyways dude i love the phone call I appreciate you brought the heat today you you were you were right on the subject matter educated that's what it's about I totally appreciate it and thanks pic yeah thank you very much and we're going to see we're gonna see you on the next call it ok alright later dude how about that what about this caller bringing the heat you know what I mean you never expected that let me just see I just want to ask people on Twitter real quick from an audio perspective can you guys hear the caller well can you can hear the caller hello i love the way that you introduced that you were just like all casual just like you're calling up your body like oh hey Lou how's it going like it wasn't hard to get through anything you're pretty sure waiting my friend actually look like it right now your life I know it's crazy it's it's wild and why is it why does it why does it feel so weird to be connecting like this don't wanna know even now I videos but i know i got don't know but um oh I'm not been here mourning you probably have been flipping my do and it does not doing he taught me how to well you taught me how to love at yeah you need you need some very serious self examination of course you know you need i think you mean I think you need some meditation yeah it's like it's like Brits a breathing thing you know what I mean it's like it's like let's do it together okay three two one i wanna i wanna cup deep inhale and we're going to exhale together okay three two one hold it for a minute and then let it out there you go my friend you're cured alright thanks for the phone call but nature in a phone call haha what what oh what a wide situation you got every day people are more lines just reaching out to the audience we've been live for 26 minutes when is the last time we hung out for 26 minutes all right here we go at what we got another one and another one and another one out they turned down turn down the show in the background yeah yeah hey man what's going on haha it is wonderful to speak to you today and this saturday afternoon how are you doing are you I also i'm also having a good time i'm sitting here talking to people i'm asking people questions I you know what we've been talking about specifically is a some technology we were talking about the nobody so far as has talked about the exploding note 7 have you heard of the exploding galaxy note 7 no okay well this is the issue alright so the new note 7 came out recently and there's been some reports somewhere in the neighborhood of like 35 reports at least that's what Samsung saying is of the new note 7 phone exploding the battery catching fire is this something that's conservative is this something that concerns you know what about the people who do are you worried for them I guess haha alright well they issued a recall so they're asking for people to send back their notes evans in exchange for a new one so at least that's the good part yeah I'm okay so let me ask you one more thing are you what kind of phone do you use right now ah do you know which model no okay well it's worth at least it's working for this phone call right here i'm happy about that but writing out all right going out google hangouts okay that works that's healthy um let me out let me out let me ask you do you have any questions for me before i go on to the next phone call oh there are ok thanks for the phone call my friend talk to you next time how about the ZTE you guys have to tell me whether or not it sounds okay the caller volume audio is good okay thank you very much Twitter folks for saying that because I've been thinking should I put it through a bluetooth speaker something along those lines to improve the quality but this thing does have pretty decent speakers and the are firing upwards so maybe maybe that's helpful okay here we go alright soon as i unlock the phone is another call hello hello yes it's who you called my friend this is who you called operators going to school there are all this year ya I'm not watching the game a to be honest that have followed too much football but you're asking about the Raiders yeah the Oakland Raiders that's a that's it used to be my favorite team as a kid actually cool they play i'm gonna give you I'm gonna give you the insight right now or were they playing alright who are they who are they up against the seahawks ok and how did that go ok alright well listen man I don't Amy I Capcom go ahead with the Chicago girl I don't think that's much of an achievement is it the Chicago Bears yeah okay make your own harbor when look at the pictures ok alright so let me let me let me ask you this is we're on the topic of one of the Oakland Raiders are you are you prepared to go out on a limb in front of almost 30,000 people and and say that they are going to be the next Champions yeah well alright without hesitation thank you my friend for bringing on to it for bringing football into the show today that's what we were missing thanks for calling all right well you hit me on the subject matter that i haven't been following definitely well as we get closer to the elimination games as you know here we go alright hello a turn down your volume in the background hello hello hello how are you doing what's your name hello oh my god oh my god oh yeah did you got to turn down the background right I'll be right out okay you're you're in here dude you gotta turn the volume down no background ok alright so how you doing what's your name they already gave like there with it tarak tarak I've heard that name before where you calling from I'm going on my out okay cool alright no I meant like to put what part of the world from his house watching your video and I'm talking for hours like yeah well let's just let's focus on this conversation is a special moment in our lives yeah yeah alright so what part of the world what part of the world are you coming from what state are you in I'm in for Diana library particularly if it's crazy that no was a hurricane women are ya doing old American army and then it is like do it so we have a car before like it might be for real that's happening right now oh yeah at the moment yeah wow alright oh yeah I see right here hermine hurricane here oh wow brings heavy rains in the Carolinas florida coast battered by I feel like we're CNN right now we're breaking new know i will show you a video but I can't right now oh we lose him we lose 10 you're still anywhere okay let me ask you something while you're sitting there surviving this barricade have you been at you have any questions for me about that well I do I awesome actually I just want to know like you're not very special position or like you know how do you know this and you accidentally fans and you have many people that-that know you and I look up to I mean how does that rabbit our responsibility how do you deal with that and the hatred and all that all the drama happening how do you do with that look at how about tarik bringing the heat on the sentimental question right now unbelievable um let me tell you i don't think it's anything that you ever really prepare for like honestly for the most part I feel I feel a lot like the same guy with the same perspective as long before anybody was paying any attention to what i was doing so I think it's imperative for me to to just stay in that frame of mind that there's really truly no difference from from somebody who has millions of followers and and somebody walking walking down the street now obviously like but obviously there is a functional difference if people are stopping you and asking for photos and stuff like that but but I feel like you you turning to a bit of a weirdo if you really strictly embrace that side of it and forget your actual pre-existing identity that was in place long before that ever was the case so I try to do this in my videos I try to do this when I meet people I try to do it even when i'm taking phone calls from people like you I just try to bring you the realness I try to bring you the guy who existed before all that and I think so long as that so long as I remain focused on protecting protecting that kind of character i think that uh the whole situation just remains a hell of a lot healthier so I keep also keep people in my life that that bringing down a few pegs like humble you know people who I stay connected to a lot of people from back in the day I'm still friends with a lot of people for example i went to high school with and that's a lot healthier to maintain those relationships with people who knew you before anything special was even going on you'd like more like I mean yes I'm percent anything I've done you can do my friend Wow and i remember seeing you like from the first or beginning they don't use your likes long boxing videos and reviews the metal products but honestly if you've been fired so many people and all that sounds clich but I'm just like that in ok alright dude yeah I honestly a nothing cliche about it I mean maybe it's been said before but it's meaningful every time that I hear it inspiration is a delicate thing and I'm happy to contribute even if it's just in a small way so appreciate the phone call I appreciate the question good luck with this storm I'm sure you're gonna make it through my friend and i helped more than you are ok thank you so much thank you so much to all right so listen we're gonna end it there i got to turn this off before million more phone calls come in we're gonna end it there that was a beautiful thing I appreciate all of you those that called in those that participated by watching we're going to have a system here right I'm going to get better audio we're going to have a better feedback i'm gonna find a streamline way of approaching this whole thing so I don't need to run off camera halfway through to address that but we didn't talk all that much about the exploding exploding note 7 for the upcoming iPhone but i think we had a couple meaningful conversations in there and before I take off i just want to remind you guys if you want your chance to call in want to participate live next time just make sure to turn on that notification button on your mobile app there's a notification button on my channel page looks like a little bell hit that button turn on notifications because obviously if you're not here live you got no shot at calling it and hit me with the hard questions while Bobo alright thank you very much catch you on the next one this is crazy welcome to the chaos I later",

I think given a few more days using it I could totally become accustomed... Would probably still come back to my MX Master from Logitech though!

    "transcript": "What's up guys, Lew here back again with another video and today I've got something that I've never seen before This company, Contour, they reached out and they said \"Lew we've got a completely different kind of mouse.\" It's called the \"Roller Mouse,\" \"Red, Plus.\" I was like \"What do you mean?\" I looked at it and I was like, \"That doesn't-\" \"That's a mouse?\" \"What do you mean here?\" I said \"Send it to me, Allow me to determine, if this thing, is revolutionary, in any kind of way.\" Apparently some people are really into this thing, look at this, On the back, it sits at the bottom of your keyboard, And you're like... you're rolling around. Who knows? Maybe you're one of these, carpal tunnel people, maybe you're looking for the future of how you might, \"mouse around,\" and maybe this is it! Nice unboxing so f... OH This thing looks... high tech. Screws.. that's comfy though... OH... very smooth actually. And this guy, slides across here as well. Your buttons, and a scroll wheel, copy 'n paste. And a button here for cursor speed. What are the screws for? If you wanna mount it to a keyboard tray. That's cool. This part here is removable, the padding, those are keyboard risers. Aaah, so depending on the thickness of your keyboard, you'll use a slightly different riser. I've got the \"Das Keyboard\" here. Ahh that fits in easily, okay, I get it. So now... right. I totally forgot that this keyboard has this ruler on the back. I totally forgot about that. For this keyboard I think the long riser is actually better. These two clip together, Short riser, Long riser, action. This is gonna be better I think... YES! Mousing around, clickety clack. \"The roller bar provides 2 functions, pressing down performs the left-click, moving it side to side,\" \"Performs cursor movement.\" \"You're the best! Aroound! Nothing's gonna ever keep you down!\" Wow ho how! Weird... I don't think I really like clicking on it, I'd think I rather click on this thing... \"Who is Jack?\" \"They had one son, Jack. In turn, Jack Schitt married Noe Schitt. The deeply religious couple produced six children. Holie Schitt, Giva Schitt, Fulla Schitt, Bull Schitt, and the twins Deep Schitt and Dip Schitt.\" S-C-H-I-T-T, Does that mean I can say it? Okey, so you got the scroll, right, that's functioning well. Mmmmm You know... I- Given the amount of time I've used it here, I feel like I'm already starting getting the hang of it. ... And from an ergonomic perspective, It's like... kind of a cool spot for my hands. \"Urban Dictionary: Behaving British,\" Do you know what that is? The act of doing something you know you'll regret immediately after. I like having the dedicated... ..Copy and paste buttons It kinda feels like you're on a keyboard, Trying to process the fact you're like-your keyboard is here and your mouse is here. It's growing on me a little bit the more I do here.. Do you know what \"Airplane Mode\" means? This is \"When someone cuts themselves off from the world by not logging on to Facebook or checking their cell phones. This occurs after a breakup or a rough work week.\" Man, you know - what's cool about it is that you can use... two hands. You know if you search Unbox Therapy, the next suggested after Unbox Therapy is Unbox Therapy Jack? This is for... Somebody who is dedicated to their ergonomics, some people they got this carpal tunnel, th-th-they're.. they're messed up. There is something satisfying about it, I will give it that. Other enviroments where you don't have a mousing surface. The racing simulator. where you can have something on your lap and you don't need to be mousing because it's all right here. It's officially the wierdest mouse I've ever tried. If you got aching arms and wrists, and... God knows what else this might be the solution to your problems.",

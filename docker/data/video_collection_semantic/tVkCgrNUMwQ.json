    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine, and today's unboxing is gonna be so much fun. I have a bunch of gear from Columbia. A huge thank you to Columbia for partnering with me on this video. Today I'm gonna be showcasing their Columbia Omni-Heat Infinity technology. Now this is featured in a ton of their jackets, boots, outerwear. So I'm so excited to get my hands on it and check it out. Now, not only are we gonna be doing an unboxing, but to show how this technology actually works to keep you warm, my sister and I are going to be heading into a cryo chamber. I will be wearing some of the Columbia Omni-Heat Infinity technology clothing, and she will not. So, clearly I'm gonna have a very unfair advantage. So hopefully I will be able to withstand the cold and she will not. This is of course, a competition. So, let's see who wins. (chamber hissing) - I'm going in there. (dramatic music) But first I'm gonna unbox some of this gear and check it out. I'm actually so excited about this because my family has been a huge Columbia fan forever. Like, when I told my mom that I was doing this video, she got so hyped because she has so many Columbia jackets. I actually, every time I go home, I always wear one of hers that has the Omni-Heat Infinity technology. So, I already know how incredible it is. So, I'm so excited to check this out for their new fall lineup. (box swishes) Let's go. We have so many goodies. I can't wait to check it out! (packages crinkling) The first item we're gonna be opening up is this. This is the Women's Payton Pass Insulated Jacket. Look at this beautiful color. Oh, I love this. So me and my sister are from the East Coast, so when we go home for the holidays, or even in the fall, or even the beginning of the year, it is freezing. So I'm very excited to really get prepped with this cryo chamber challenge to get us ready for this winter. This is where you're really gonna see the Omni-Heat Infinity technology. All of these gold little dots. Not only is it beautiful, but it's actually functional. This lining is actually thousands of little gold dots that reflect and retain the body heat. This will provide instant warmth without sacrificing breathability. Omni-Heat Infinity is the gold standard in warmth, and in 2022, Columbia is continuing to grow the product line to offer even more options for warmth. (jacket ruffles) Oh my gosh, it's so comfortable. In this hat is comfy. Oh my goodness! Cryo chamber, I am so ready for you. (laid back jazz music) I don't wanna take it off. Let's see what else we have to go with this. Let's take a little look at these shoes. (paper crinkles) I love hiking at any temperature. I don't care what it is. So I'm excited to try these out during my winter hikes. Oh, perfect fit, too. These are nice. Look at that bottom. I love having some extra tread here. Ooh, I love out outdoor gear. To go along with a jacket, I got a matching pair of gloves. These are also touchscreen compatible, which is very important. Not gonna lie. Ready for the winter times. Look at that. (laid back jazz music) We're scrolling. We're scrolling. The gloves have not only passed the fit check they've also passed the scroll check. We've also got a hat. Check this out. It's crazy to think that pretty soon there's gonna be snow on the ground and I'm gonna actually need all of these items. This is another Omni-Heat shirt. (plastic crinkles) I like that they not only have this Omni-Heat technology in their jackets, but they also have it in various pieces of clothing as well. I'm gonna be so prepped for this challenge. Jenna isn't even gonna know. Actually, she kind of knows the challenge is gonna be unfair because she has a few jackets with the Omni-Heat Infinity technology and she's already said, \"That's not fair because I already know how warm it is.\" I've got some pants as well. Oh wow. These are... these feel so comfy. This has the Omni-Shield. So, this has advanced water repellent. I like that these have some little, additional secret pockets to hide all my snacks when I'm out. This one, when I saw it on the website, I was like this is what I need for cozy season. I love flannel so much that I had a problem for a while. Like my sister was like, you have to stop buying it. Like I feel like I wanna go pick some pumpkins now. And we also have another. This is the same as the black one. I like this color 'cause this will match the jacket that I got as well. I can probably live in the cryo chamber at this point with all of this gear. I'm gonna be so warm. So, now that I have all of my gear unboxed, I need to go prep and get ready for the cryo chamber. I hope Jenna's ready, 'cause I know I am. The time is now! So we are heading into a cryo chamber. I have never done this before, have you? - No, absolutely not, because I hate being cold. - I absolutely hate being cold. I'm the worst. I mean, if it gets below like 70, I am full blankets. I've got jackets on. Don't like to be cold. - So what's actually gonna happen? This is a challenge, right? - So, yes. So, we're each gonna go into the cryo chamber at separate times. Now we're not gonna know each other's times until the end. - Okay. - So, we won't know who actually won the challenge. So, the goal is to stay in the longest. And of course this is gonna be kind of cheating a little bit because we are gonna be wearing some outdoor gear but these can get up to, not up to, down to like a negative 120 Fahrenheit. - She actually said it could go as low as negative like 200 Fahrenheit. (Justine gasps) On a good day. - That's so cold. - I said on a good day. That sounds like a bad day to me, but. - Do you think today's gonna be a good or bad day? - Here's where you have the advantage. Yeah, 'cause I have the Columbia Omni-Heat technology in my clothes. So I'm basically, I'm cheating, to be completely honest with you. - Yeah, so, I'm gonna really do my best here 'cause I don't have that. But good luck to you. - The thing is, you actually do have some Columbia gear. - I do! - But you're not allowed to wear it! - I'm not allowed to wear it. I had to leave it at home. I had to wear a competitor brand. - Sorry, not sorry. So, I definitely feel like I already have an advantage but let's try this out. You ready? - No. - Oh! - Yes, sure. - Boy! In we go. Face the freeze. (chill electronic music) Oh my goodness. Okay, right now, it's pre-cooling. So we're each gonna go in one by one. We have a timer here, and then whoever can stay in the longest wins the challenge. - That's, I'm already cold right now. - I know my butt's cold. - This is very intimidating. - [Justine] Oh, I guess, oh, it's ready. - It's ready. - Oh my gosh. Okay, I'm gonna go first. - Okay. - And then we're not, I'm not gonna tell you my score. - Good luck. - Uh! (chill electronic music) So I'm a little nervous, but I'm also not that nervous because even before when I was in my house and trying this on, I was sweating. So I'm fully prepared and confident that I might get a little chilly, but I'll be able to withstand all of the temperatures. (chill electronic music) (chamber hisses) Oh! I'm going in there. Oh boy. (playful orchestral music) Okay, Jenna's gonna do the honors and hit start. I'm going in guys. I'm going in. Okay, I'm in. I'm in. Go for it. - [Jenna] All right. Everything is started. - Okay. - I'm running away. Good luck. - Yeah, you can't know how long I'm in here. So far, I feel nothing yet. My body feels perfectly fine. But the only thing that I feel slight chill is on my hands. But they're not even that cold. This is like a walk in the park. (playful orchestral music) Legs, body feels perfectly fine. I know what Jenna's wearing and she's gonna be freaking freezing. (Justine laughs) Like I could probably be in here for an hour and be fine. The only thing is like my hands are a little cold. It's a little cold on the fingys. (chamber hissing) (dramatic music) - [Adam] You are at negative 112 degrees. - Negative 112. Hooo! At what temperature do zippers get frozen? Look at that, look at that, look at that, look at that. Okay, my hands are cold. This is the only thing that's cold. Feet feel fine. Oh yeah, we're fine. I'm seeing little bits of ice crystals forming on my hands. I do think if this was like a full body with my face in there, I don't know how I'd feel. I'm glad that my face is out. Hands are a little cold. Let's keep it going. Let's keep it going. Come on, we got this. I also forgot to take my rings off, which was a very, very poor move on my part. What a dumb move that was. This is gonna be really unfair to Jenna. So I think the next time that it times out I'm just gonna be like, all right, I'm done. Eight minutes. Hooooo-eeee. - [Children] Hooray! (children clapping) - [Adam] It stopped at exactly eight minutes. - All right, I'm tapping out only because I know for a fact Jenna's not gonna be able to withstand this, so there's no reason to even keep going. How do I get outta here? (playful orchestral music) (Justine gasps) Oh, my goodness. Wait, look, I have ice all over me. (shoe clunks) So, I definitely should not have had my rings on. Like that was a really bad move. These zippers are actually frozen. I have ice crystals that have formed all over my body. Frozen fingertips. If I wasn't wearing this, I would be absolutely frozen. I would be a frozen fish stick and I would be putting myself into the microwave and having myself for dinner. Good luck, Jenna. Good luck. - It's my time to go in. I don't know how long you were in there. I don't know how long I'm gonna be in here but my legs are already cold. It's scary in here, Jus! Here we go. My legs are already cold and it's not active. (Jenna breathes deeply) - [Justine] All right, ready, here we go. Three, two, one. (chamber hissing) (laid back jazz music) - Oh, it's cold. It's very cold. How do people do this without clothes on? Whoa. I know these pants. Nope, my butt is cold. My legs are very cold. My hands are really cold. And my arms are starting to get very cold. Okay, so my pants are so cold that when I move it makes it even worse. (chamber hissing) People do this for fun? I hate losing, but I'm not gonna make it very long. I'm like shiver. I'm shivering. (Jenna chattering) People do this without clothes for three minutes? (Jenna breathes deeply) Even though I might not have the best winter gear on, I have on winter gear. - [Adam] You're only at negative 55 degrees. - You're kidding. I'm only negative 50. Not 155, just 55? I don't like how I feel. My arms are really cold. I'm literally shivering. Like, I actually think my hands are frozen. My butt is cold. My back is cold. - [Adam] If you were a frozen food, what would you be? - Frozen mozzarella stick. I wanna get out. My hands are cold. I'm tapping out. Let me out. Get out. Bye. (dramatic music) There's ice. I'm covered in ice. There's frost on me. Now I know why the word cry is in it. - How did it go, Jenna? - My hands are very, very cold. Can you feel that? - Yes. Wow. - Oh, my gosh. - Feel my arm. I had crystals. - I felt way more cold though. I had like ice crystals all over my body. - Oh, you must have been in there way longer. - [Adam] At the same time, the count of three, say the amount of time that you were in there. - Okay. - Three. - Okay. - Two, one. - Eight minutes. - Three minutes, 30 seconds. Eight minutes?! - Dude, I could've went longer but I was so worried about you because the only thing that was cold on me. - You have fuzzies. - Was like, my hands started getting a little chilly. - My hands were tingling. My legs were so cold that whenever I like moved, the skin would touch the pant that it would, I would feel the coldness again. Like I felt nothing on my body. - My butt. - Absolutely nothing. - Like my butt wasn't covered by the jacket so, my butt was cold. Like my arms started to get real. Like this wasn't as bad. - Yeah. - But like I was still like, I was shivering. Like, I was actually like my arms were starting to go like numb. - Okay, that's when they say you gotta get out. - I did. I was like, I gotta get out. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, that's bad. - So yeah, I was not that warm. - I was so warm. Honestly, I probably could have stayed in there for another like 30 minutes maybe. - It's frowned upon. - Yeah, I know. - Three minutes without clothes, I believe. - Should I try it without clothes? Oh, my God. Okay, I'm going to do this for real. I'm gonna take my necklace off. I took my rings off this time. I'm cold already. I haven't even entered. (Jenna speaks indistinctly) Okay, start me up. (button clicks) (chamber hissing) I'm so cold. And it hasn't even started yet. Okay. Shh. Gotta think warm thoughts. I hate it so much. Oh, Jenna. - Oh, no, what? Oh. - Okay, she said if I start getting dizzy, I should get out right? - Are you dizzy? - I don't know. I'm not sure yet. I don't know if I should get out. I feel a little dizzy. I'm gonna get out. I feel dizzy. Okay, I feel dizzy. Feel dizzy. How long did I make it? - [Jenna] I don't actually know. It says you have 105 seconds left. - I got a little dizzy. - [Jenna] It's fine. I'm gonna try it. - I feel like this is something you have to work up to. I'm gonna try again maybe in the future. - My turn. - I didn't like it. There she goes. - Okay. - Okay, she's going in. - Okay. - Okay. Close it up. - Okay. - [Justine] There she goes, there she goes. She's so Zen, look at her. Look at her. Zen. - It's like when you walk in the grocery store next to the freezer section and you're like ooh, that's cold, I wasn't dressed for the grocery store. But like you take off most of your clothes and walk by it and then get in it. I don't really like it. I think I can make 10 more seconds. Okay, Adam. Can I get out? - Yeah, you can get out. - Can you push pause? I think you have to pause it. - Yes. Pause, okay, you can come out. - I don't like it. My little bones feel cold. Okay, so, that was actually so much fun and I really wanna work my way up to being able to do that for three minutes, for real, one day. - I think it would be good for everybody considering how cold you always are. Maybe you would like build your tolerance. - Maybe. - But now with your new gear, you also, you know, you don't really need to build your tolerance. You can just throw on a jacket. - What about with your new gear? Here you go, Jenna. So this is a gift for you since you were the loser of the challenge and you froze your little buns off in there. - Yeah. - Columbia and I wanted to gift you this wonderful Omni-Heat technology gear. We've got a jacket, we've got a shirt, and we've also got some pants for you. - [Jenna] It's really tied securely. Look, we can match. - I know! - This is nice. Hold it up. - It's so great. - We can match. This is very nice. Are these pants? - Yes, but this... - Ooh! - is the Payton Pass jacket. - [Jenna] Blue is my favorite color. - I know, that's why I picked that one! Unzip. - Okay. - And check this out. It's all lined with this gold. - [Jenna] Ah! Ooh! - [Justine] This is the Omni Infinity technology. - Oh, it's cool. - Yes. I know. Put that on. - Oh, this is like a dream. - [Justine] I know. - And it's finally getting chilly in LA so it's like, jacket weather. (jacket ruffles) - I like the little fluff around it too. - Is this how warm you were? - Yes. - Oh, man. Although, well, yeah. No, I'm ready to go. Oh, they have pockets! - I know. So great. Well thank you so much, Jenna, and huge thank you to Columbia for partnering with us on this video. This was so much fun. And I really, really do wanna try this again and work my way up to be able to do a few minutes. That's my challenge to myself. - I'm just gonna stay cozy in my jacket and maybe work my way up. - Thank you guys so much for watching. I'll put a link in the description if you wanna check out the gear that I was wearing while I did the ColdZone challenge. And yeah, that's it. - I'm gonna check it out. - We are so ready for the East Coast winter now. - I know. Well, even LA. We're gonna do the mountains. Big bear. - Big bear. Yeah, it gets chilly here. - They have snow. Yeah. - Okay. - Thank you. - Bye! (laid back jazz music)",

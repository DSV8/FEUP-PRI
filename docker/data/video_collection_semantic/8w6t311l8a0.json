    "transcript": "so the leaks and rumors were true about Samsung's Galaxy S10 we have three models sharing a lot of features in common including the Infiniti o display a headphone jack yep they still hear guys and a variety of color options to choose from what's up everyone Eber here with Hydra connects and this is my first impressions after spending about 30 minutes with the Galaxy S10 let's get started alright so first and foremost there are three models of the S10 for 2019 the S10e which is the cheapest among the three then there's the standard s10 and the S10+ and here the color options so there's prism white prism blue prism green prism black flamingo pink that's right my friends and the highest spec s10 plus can also be picked up in a ceramic white finish which honestly felt amazing in the hands it's a welcoming upgrade over glass back finishes for sure but it does come at a cost now do keep in mind that all these color options are gonna be scattered across different regions so if you live in Canada you may be unlucky because unfortunately we won't be getting the green the pink and I think a few other color options too so again it's very dependent on where you live now one of the key features of the s10 lineup is the introduction of the Infiniti o display or in other words an all new dynamic AMOLED screen so essentially they've extended the screen size all the way to the top and the bottom giving it well over 90% of the screen to body ratio as well as implementing this in display camera sensor I like to call it the punch hole display and honestly guys I have mixed feelings about it I certainly have to spend a little bit more time to get used to it but but yeah that's that's what it is that's what we're dealing with with the s10 it sure gives the phone a cool concept vibe and you know there's no denying the fact that Samsung loves to push their boundaries when it comes to smart phone design and engineering and I highly appreciate that so the instant eye and the s10 comes with a single front-facing 10 megapixel sensor that can now shoot 4k video which is pretty neat while the s10 plus comes with dual cameras so one of them being an RGB depth sensor that allows the user to play around with different portrait mode thanks and other things while the other sensor is a same 10 megapixel shooter just like its younger siblings the display by itself looks absolutely stunning this is probably the best aching yet Samsung does still take the crown here once again when it comes to display technology it now comes with the HDR 10 plus certification although I'm not exactly sure how users are gonna take advantage of that because content being shot in HDR is still very limited it's not mainstream yet so I'm kind of curious to see how that will play out in the future and you know in terms of color accuracy it's pretty awesome if you're looking for you know that cool vibrant and contrast you look s10 certainly delivers and you know it's pretty similar to what you would experience with other previous Samsung devices I should also mention that they've also increased a screen brightness so visibility outdoors is certainly going to be a lot better speaking of the display I think it probably good time to talk about the security built inside the S10 and the S10 plus so basically what Samsung has done is they've implemented a 3d ultrasonic sensor underneath the glass so every time when you put your finger on it it'll scan a 3d contour of your finger or your thumb depending on which finger you decide to use and it'll store that into the anoxia built inside the device for the best possible security so it's a cool feature and from my quick demo or just testing or playing around with it it seems to be working just fast although I still have to get the unit in my hand to test it out and give you guys my verdict on that technology but it's certainly gonna be a lot better than what you would normally find with the oneplus 60s in display fingerprint sensor because it's still you know not the best in the business so that's definitely something I guess I'm looking forward to testing out now the s10e you're not gonna be getting the ultrasonic sensor because Samsung decided to implement a physical reader on the side of the device which is okay because it's organ ami just a perfect spot to kind of hold your phone and unlock the device and I guess I don't really have anything to complain about that next up are the cameras and Samsung decided to go all out this time by implementing three sensors on the S10 and the S10 plus unfortunately the S10e only comes with two cameras but I think that's still something so the triple camera setup consists of an ultra wide-angle 16 megapixel sensor with a field of you of roughly 123 degrees you also get a standard wide-angle lens which is 800 megapixel shooter and a telephoto lens for that extra reach now an awesome thing baked inside the camera application is the ability to seamlessly switch between those three lenses by simply zooming in and out within the camera app and I things will come in super beneficial for the average consumer now another thing that Samsung baked inside the camera application is an intelligent camera assistant that essentially gives you shot suggestions and when it comes to framing a particular subject and I'm really looking forward to testing that out when I get my hands on this device another key feature of the s10 is wireless power share so this essentially allows you to charge your Qi enabled devices wirelessly on the s10 and that can be turned on through the quick settings app so it doesn't have to be turned on you know pretty much all the time and I do have to mention that it doesn't support fast wireless charging but rather you know it's rated wattage is around 4.5 watts so you know if you're charging your SmartWatch or just regular things that don't necessarily need or require fast charge I think this is a pretty cool feature the last thing to discuss here is performance and the rest of the specs so you're getting the latest Snapdragon 855 CPU across all three devices ip68 water-resistant rating expandable storage fast charge 2.0 there's also support for next gen Wi-Fi six or eight oh two dot eleven ax support which is pretty cool and you can pick up the s10e the S10 and the S10 plus and different memory and storage configurations I think the absolute specta version that you can get on the s10 is the S10 plus with 12GB of RAM and a terabyte of storage so there's that and I'm pretty sure that's gonna cost you an arm and a leg so do keep that in mind now speaking of pricing I think that's probably the most anticipated part that you guys were looking forward to so here it goes the s10 II is gonna start at $749 the s10 is going to start at $8.99 and the s10 plus is going to be $1000 you can actually pre-order the phone today and it goes on sale on March the 8th and there are different trading programs that Samsung does offer so you know that's one way to get your hands on the new s10 so that's it guys that's my first impressions with the Galaxy S10 three new phones from Samsung for the of 2019 I'm sure there's the note 10 that's coming later down the road we're looking forward to testing out this device because for one you know it's priced differently across different models they all share something in common you know some I mean it's but the S10e doesn't get a lot of the features at the S10 and S10 plus have so it's gonna be interesting to see how these phones play out for the rest of the year but stay tuned for my long-term review of these devices and yeah that's pretty much it let me know what you guys think about the s10 you know is it a phone that you would consider upgrading to in 2019 if you're coming from I don't know an essayed or even an s9 well tune your thoughts in the comments also I do want mention that now might be a good time to pick up the s9 because it's on sale for around $500 and actually leave links to those phones in the description down below if you want to pick it up for a really good deal so there's that yeah that's pretty much it make sure to check out some relevant content over here to subscribe to our boot sequence channel I mean both Hardware Canucks signing off and I'll see you guys in the next one",

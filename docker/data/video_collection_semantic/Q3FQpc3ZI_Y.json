    "transcript": "- Alright, here we go. (clapping) Did I clap already? Yo, guys. Jonathan here, and welcome to the Behind the Scenes of iPhone X unboxing. I thought it would be cool to give you a sneak peek of what goes on into a video. This particular shot is gonna be focused on the iPhone X trick shot where, in this case the phone sitting here isn't going to be in that shot. I'm going to reach this way, and hopefully, grab the iPhone X and bring it out here to kick off the video. Yeah. (upbeat acoustic guitar music) So at some point, I'm gonna toss the phone to you since you got a free hand. - [Brandon] You betcha. - And then I'll catch it outside. Yo, guys, Jonathan here. I'm excited, and hopefully you are too, and that is because it is iPhone X unboxing time. This is it. Let's go. - I'm happy. - Cool. So we got the footage inside Final Cut Pro X. We of course have the main talking shot, the second silly shot of the iPhone X. Drew a little masker on that, feathered it off to give it a nice little smooth look, and I think, Rich, if you wanna come make sure we didn't screw this up. We're gonna watch it back for the first time. And we go full-screen. Jonathan here. I'm excited and hopefully you are too, and that is because it is iPhone X unboxing time. This is it. (slapping table) Let's go. Got 'em. So we're moving on to the outdoor shot. This is gonna be where I catch the phone from me throwing it to myself. We got Brandon, Rich. Rich is gonna throw the phone to me. Brandon locking down the camera. - 'Sup. - And, uh... Let's see if we can pull this one off. We got some nice sweet, sweet lens flare. J.J. Abrams, what's up? So, here we have the box with the iPhone X in it. - We have to record that, sorry. I'm an idiot. - You're not an idiot, Brandon. - You like it like that though, just kinda like this? - 'Kay, give me a heave. - Like Jansen last night, getting wrecked. - Who's Jansen again? - Dodgers, man. Sorry to all you Dodgers fans. That was a brutal, brutal game. He was a Dodgers fan. He doesn't look too happy right now. - You want me to get the wide shot of you saying that? - Let's do that one more time. Yeah, we'll do it one more time. - Cool. Uh, wide, or close? - Wide, wide. I think we have enough when up close to cover it. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy there. - Three, two, and go. - So, here we have the box, iPhone X previewed on the outside. We got that pretty, pretty, pretty wallpaper, that notch, which may be for better or for worse, but we shall see. Towards the bottom, we have the flashlight icon, the camera icon, and from what I understand, you can access those by 3D touching, and actually what might be the coolest part about this box, and I'm not sure if you can pick it up, but this outer part, which would be the stainless steel portion of the iPhone X, on the box, actually has this little bit of reflective shine, and is kind of awesome. Now as far as the lighting, this is actually one of the coolest things I've picked up in a long time, the Westcott Flex light kit. This is in a china box, something like that, where this is the Westcott Flex soft box. And they're super portable, you can take these in a suitcase, and just to give you a demo what it looks like, Rich, you wanna kill the right light? And I have this sitting just off to the side here, giving me some fill here, and kinda battling the super bright windows behind us. One light off, second light. There we go, so you can see that should make a huge difference. Back on. Thanks, buddy. So now we've hopped over to the night scene. It's completely dark outside and these lights are really really, really coming through. It's kind of incredible what we got here. We got pumpkins everywhere. So I'm just gonna give you a little sneak peek of the image right now. Pumpkin one. Switch up that light for a warm light, give it a little bounce. We got pumpkins and some sweet lens flare. I'm recording on the iPhone X right now. This is actually a really cool piece of tech from Quasar Science, portable light, you can take it anywhere, it's magnets. Jesse Pinkman would be proud. Not sure again what this little light is called, but it actually will split up color, so that's giving us a little splash in the background. And Rich running sound, Brandon making sure I don't screw this up. And here we go. So with this night scene to give you a little example of what these lights are doing I'm gonna turn this main light off. Rich, do you wanna go hit that other light? Probably looking Halloween AF right now. 'Bout to get creepier in a second. That's a pretty big difference, so main one, overhead, back on. Probably looks pretty good, got a little shadow going on right now, and then we're gonna use this as the fill and it does an amazing job. (beeping) Yeah, I'm a monkey. Rich. I'm gonna break your legs. Aww, I'm gonna sound like an (bleep).",

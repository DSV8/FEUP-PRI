    "transcript": "- I had the fantastic opportunity to interview Eben Upton, the creator of the Raspberry Pi. Eben was very gracious and spent quite a bit of time with me. I interviewed him about the chip shortage. I interviewed him about various topics about the Raspberry Pi. But one of the things I wanted to do is get a bit of behind-the-scenes content. - I'm Eben Upton and I'm one of the founders of Raspberry Pi. (heavy synthesizer music plays) - Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi (music winds down) - Hey everyone, it's David Bombal back with a very, very special guest. Eben, welcome. - Good to be here. - So we are not in my normal studio. Where are we? - We're in the Maurice Wilkes Building. We're in the place we call Pi Towers, just on the outskirts of Cambridge, where we design Raspberry Pis. Sixty years as a fellow of St. John's College. Imagine that. I've been a fellow of St. John's College for three years so I have a little bit of catching up to do. (slow electric guitar plays) So yeah, this is Raspberry Pi. Fairly generic cubicle, and the reality of modern engineering is that it's mostly done at a desk in front of a workstation. Very little of it- Even of what we do, and we are a hardware company, very little of what we do is done with the soldering iron. However, some things are done with the soldering iron. And things that are done with the soldering iron tend to happen in here. This is the lab. This is Roger Thornton, he's the Director of Application Engineering and also designer of Raspberry Pi Zero W and Raspberry Pi 3B+. And, yeah, you know, we have the usual collection of stuff, right, big ovens, expensive test equipment, a lot of soldering irons, a lot of reels of components. I don't think we've ever built a Raspberry Pi product in its entirety here. It would be prohibitively expensive and prohibitively complicated to build even the simplest thing that we make actually in this room so we tend to, even the short run prototyping, we tend to shop out to specialist 3rd parties. Things we might do here, we'll do rework here. So if we have a board that has a chip on and we want to try- A thing you do quite often during a development of a platform is to try what we call split-lots. So these are pieces of silicon which are intentionally fast or intentionally slow. When chips come out of the fab, there's a distribution, a normal distribution, of speed, which corresponds largely to the doping levels and the various dopings that get diffused into the silicone. And there are slow parts which are where the transistors run slowly, but the chip doesn't leak very much. And you might worry about those parts because, will they perform at the target clock speed? And then you have fast parts where the transistors work very fast but they're very leaky. And you might worry about those parts 'cause you might worry they might overheat, they might malfunction, they might consume too much power, they might brown out the power supply. They might generate too much heat, overheat and cook, do what we call thermal runaway. One thing you do during the development of a platform is, you request from the foundry what we call split-lots, fast silicone, slow silicone, sometimes what we call cross-splits. 'Cause of course modern CMOS chips have both NMOS and PMOS transistors in them. They have separate doping so you can actually get what we call a cross-split. You can get a chip where the PMOS is artificially doped to be fast and the NMOS artificially doped to be slow or vice versa. And you kind of worry that maybe some of your circuits won't work well under those circumstances. So you have fast silicon, slow silicon, and split silicone. What you might do is take a Raspberry Pi 4 you get some 27-11 split silicone from the fab. You take off the existing chip, the existing regular production chip, and you put one of these special chips on and you test, use some of this test equipment to evaluate whether the device is still performing the way you want it to perform. So that kind of re-work we can do here. Even low-volume prototype manufacturing, we don't tend to do in this room. Give you an example of what we might do with this oven. USB power supplies. When we did the USB power supply for Raspberry Pi 4, we took a bunch of them and we put them in this oven and we ran them at 90 degrees, ran them under maximum load at 90 degrees for a month. - [David] For a month? - For a month. Now, obviously our supplier has done their own testing, does their own unit testing, has done their own qualification testing. But there's nothing as reassuring as seeing that, say, 50 USB power supply survived an ambient operating environment of 90 degrees for a month to satisfy yourself that the practical environment of 20 degree, 20 or 30 degree ambient, they're gonna survive for 4, 5, 6 years. - Evan and I recorded an interview at the Raspberry Pi offices where I basically quizzed him about the chip shortage and the issues with delivering Raspberry Pis. But then we walked around St. John's College and he explained a bit about the history and the origins of the Raspberry Pi. - So this is Second Court, in St. John's College, Cambridge. The largest functioning Tudor court in the world. Hampton Court may have something a bit bigger. This is the one that's actually used on a day-to-day basis by students and academics, and it's where I spent my undergraduate life from 1996 to 99. And then my PhD from 2001 through to 2006. Yeah, it's kind of a, it's a wonderful place. It's also where I was Director of Studies where we first, well, certainly where I first became aware of the collapse in the number of applicants to computer science. It's amazing, how moderate the vision was, I suppose, you know, that we were... - To what it's become. - Yeah, it's, you know, we thought, \"Well, we'll build a thousand units, and we'll get them into the hands of the right thousand kids. A tenth of those apply to study computer science at Cambridge.\" We wanna find about a hundred kids a year to come to Cambridge to study computing. And we were down to about 200 applicants. I mean, that's incredible, right? And so this is a really simple ambition. Give out a thousand computers, get an extra a hundred applicants. Oh! Now we've got 300 applicants for a hundred places. That's really a material change. We interview school kids, you know, prospective students in December. And I went down to the tutorial office in December 2004 and I went to get my bundle of folders. 'Cause it was all paper back then, right? I went to get my bundle of folders. It was seven, I think, seven folders I had. - How many students does Cambridge accept? - So, Cambridge accepts about a hundred. I think we were looking to accept three or four and I had seven applicants. And so it's down to that kind of two-to-one ratio that we talked about. - Yeah. - You know, it's very disadvantageous, great from the students' point of view, but from the university's point of view a very disadvantageous ratio. - And since those days, now, what is it? One and a half thousand or something? - Yes, one and a half thousand. I think St. John's is sort of 40 to 50. It's about 40 to 50 students. But yeah, broadly the same number of places. I think we've managed to find another one or two places. You know, the ratios are much more the ten-to-one. Ten-to-one, fifteen-to-one kind of ratios that you kind of associate with a popular, healthy course. And I think it's really important to emphasize that we never got to a point where we, you know, the kids, I, you know- I had my seven folders and we omitted three young people and they were absolutely first class. - Yeah. - Absolutely first class intellect. We never got to a point where we had to let anyone in who wasn't good. But I think we got to the point where we were letting in everybody who was good. - Yeah. And you said you wanted to have like, contention for it, right? - Yeah. You wanna have a little bit of contention, you know, you want it to be a bit challenging. This is First Court, and you can see this is a sort of a wonderful kind of historical vandalism that would occur at Cambridge. You have this amazing kind of Tudor, these two amazing Tudor walls. And you can see that at some point they demolished one wall and they built this, which is extremely nice. But it's probably more livable than that. But you know, you can't imagine someone in the 21st century looking at something like this and thinking, \"Yeah, let's knock it down and build something new.\" And that's, kind of, we were talking about Yale, talking about the difference between here and some of the American universities. Everything here is very hodgepodge, very kind of cobbled together. - But it's over, like, hundreds of years? Or... - Yeah, over the course of hundreds of years. And so what you have is this kind of mishmash of historical styles. You know, this is, Liz and I got married there. So this is the college chapel, which is relatively new by college standards. It's, I think, a hundred and some years old. Nothing is planned here, you know. And too, you'll have- And that does occasionally generate these kind of architectural monstrosities, but it also generates this kind of wonderful, kind of hodgepodge, higgeldy-piggeldy kind of feel that characterizes the place. What we'll do is, we'll walk across the Kitchen Bridge so we get a nice view of the Bridge of Sighs. But yeah, a lot of happy days spent. Dick McConnell, my tutor when I was an engineer, had a set up in there. I think the first or second floor, a set up in here, kind of up inside that. - A lot of the early work was done here, right? - Yeah, yeah that's right. I mean a lot of the- Certainly the inspiration for the work was, the inspiration for the work came from the experience of being a Director of Studies here. And I was still a Director of Studies when I was building the very earliest prototypes. I stopped in 2007. And what I came up with, shall I pick this up? What I ended up with was this. So this is a... This is a computer. I stayed on as Director of Studies. So I was a Director of Studies for the last little bit of my PhD. But I really felt that I wasn't giving it my full attention. Very quickly on joining, Broadcom got sucked into doing all this kind of very exciting engineering. And you're kind of thinking, \"Am I really giving these guys a fair crack at the whip?\" So fortunately the college recruited another fellow, Rob Mullins was one of my co-founders at Raspberry Pi. I was able to give up the Director of Studies role. I did the MBA and then I was absent from the college for... - [David] From... - Yeah, this is the Bridge of Sighs. So this is the kind of- this is your canonical Cambridge view, the Bridge of Sighs. I used to have the room, I used to have a room up there, in the the top floor there, looking down on the- you could look down on the noisy tourists and the punts while you're trying to revise for your exams. Used to chuck things out the window at them to try to shut 'em up. You can see 1671, you know, you can see the sort of age of this, Third Court which is relatively new for something on this side of the river, is itself getting on from 400 years old. And if you look this way, I don't like to look that way 'cause this is Trinity College. So these are the enemy, obviously, they are the only college that is older, sorry, is larger and richer than us. And the fact that they're right next door is absolutely maddening. It's Trinity College. And if you look at the building, the building that we can see end on here, the building that's on the river, that's the Wren Library. That was designed by Sir Christopher Wren. We might be able to see a little bit more when we get further along, but you'll see there's nothing on the ground floor. Until relatively recently, the level of the river was not well controlled. - Oh, yeah. - And so, if you've got books, are you gonna put 'em on the first floor? You can actually start to see now, there's an open cloister underneath and all the books are up on the higher floors. Over here is New Court and that's East Staircase, New Court. What you're gonna get to see through the middle there, that's East Staircase, New Court, where I met Liz, my co-founder and wife, my wife and co-founder, in 1997. I can't remember whether I was going up the stairs and she was coming down the stairs or vice versa. But she suddenly got my attention. - And thank goodness for that. - Yeah, right? You know? - Where you created it. - Yeah, that's it. It's quite something. What you're starting to see over here, this is the Cripps building. So this is in the first year. Talk about architectural monstrosities. So I always used to think when I lived in it that the Cripps building was an architectural monstrosity. But actually, they've subsequently- It was built in the sixties. It's not actually made out of concrete. It's made out of Portland stone. It just looks like concrete. - Oh wow. - Yeah. But it's actually really rather nice. It sort of looks lovely in the sunshine now. It'll be 10 years ago they refurbed it and it's come out very nicely. So in the first year, you're in the ugly stuff looking out at the beautiful stuff, but you're nice and warm. In the second year, you're in the drafty old stuff looking at the ugly new stuff. The first years do get the best the best gig here. - That's not a reason to fail. - Yeah, no, no, absolutely not. So you get a nice view of the Wren Library back there. You can see here quite, quite something. You get a nice view of the chapel tower there. But it's, you can imagine what it's like. This is a lovely place to- - [David] Unbelievable. - It's a lovely place to be an undergraduate. - But what I love about it, at the end of the day, is you came here, but that didn't stop you creating something that changes the lives of people all over the world. - A law of unintended consequences, isn't it? You try and build something to, for one... It's back to the power of general purpose computers, right? If you build something which has a kind of an uncommitted feel to it you know, something which could do anything, then you don't know what people are gonna do with it. And I mean, we are just lucky that people- We did accomplish what we were trying to... We accomplished what we were trying to accomplish, but we also seemed to have accomplished a bunch of other stuff as well. And certainly, at 50 million units, what are we, we are four orders of magnitude beyond the sort of scale that we expected to be at. - The number-one selling computer in the UK is the Raspberry Pi, right? - I believe so. So, the number-one selling computer coming out of the UK. I think the Sinclair Spectrum was probably the previous record holder. And I think actually, there are Amstrad fan boys. I think that the Amstrad PCW may have sold eight million. I think when we went past five million. We tweeted, \"Ah! We're the best-selling British computer!\" and you would not believe how many fans there are of the Amstrad PCW 8.5.12, or something, saying no, they did eight million units over a decade. So yeah, so let's say eight million units for PCW. - But you're doing, like, seven million a year now. - What's kind of exciting about this year is we get to find out what our real demand is. Last time we had an unconstrained year it was 2020. So we've had two constraint years, of which, of course, last year was particularly painful. My belief is based on what we can see, we're gonna turn out to be an eight to nine million unit a year business now. We won't really know. And of course there will be a little bit of overshoot. It is one of the big challenges, running the business over the next six months. This nice problem to have is to manage that overshoot of demand. That there will be a period where you look at our second half of the year and the budget for the second half of the year has multiple million-unit months in it. Now we've never done a million-unit month. The biggest month we ever had was actually March 2021, just before we went into shortage, which was 850,000 units. So we've never done a a million unit year. We're planning, and we have backlog to support multiple million-unit months. And really what I've gotta do, the commercial team's gotta do, is to kind of catch. Some of that demand will drop away. 'Cause some of that demand is pent-up demand. It's people filling- There's various buffers in the system filling up. And you know, some of those buffers are very obvious buffers, just, like, the number of units that are available in the sum of all of the approved resellers, and the number of units that are available across all the distributors. Okay. We're now going through East Staircase. - [David] This is the famous staircase, right? - [Eben] This is the famous staircase. - When I was setting up this interview, I heard about these famous stairs. This is where he met Liz, his wife. So together they formed the Raspberry Pi Foundation and obviously a lot of the success of the Raspberry Pi is due to these set of stairs. - And the fun thing, actually, about this was that the room that we were going to and from was actually a chap called Alex Evans, who was one of the co-founders, went on to be one of the co-founders of Media Molecule who did Little Big Planet. So it's like a lot of fun stuff came out of our year, actually, at St. John's. The goal, really, is as you fill those buffers and then demand I think we'll fall away to maybe 700,000 units a month. We've just got to kind of catch that without overshooting, without ending up holding a lot of inventory ourselves and exposing ourselves to financial risk. - Are they not ordering more and more and more? Or do you think they're also just filling buffers? - You look at our backlog, now, our backlog is very actively managed. We do have some comfort that there really is underlying and ongoing demand there, but there's inevitably gonna be buffer fill. There's gonna be buffer fill we can detect, but there'll be buffer fill we can't detect, as well. And so we just have to be very careful about how we manage. I don't wanna get stuck with a million 4-gig Raspberry PI 4s. - No. - It's 50 million of inventory, right? So you've just gotta be a little bit careful as we do that. - I really wanna thank Eben once again for spending so much time with me, showing me around St. John's, showing me around the Raspberry Pi offices, giving us a bit of the behind-the-scenes context about the Raspberry Pi. I also hope that you enjoyed this video. Let me know in the comments below the kind of interviews you want to see. I'm hoping to reach out to lots of people and get behind-the-scenes information about the products that we use every day. I'm David Bombal and I wanna wish you all the very best.

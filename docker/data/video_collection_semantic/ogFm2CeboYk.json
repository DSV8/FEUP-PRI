    "transcript": "What's going on everyone in this video we'll be playing pc building simulator this is part two the second time i've ever played this game now there is kind of a catch here the first time i played it happened to be the day before they released the free i t expansion which apparently is pretty freaking awesome i love that it's free thank you devs i appreciate you not charging us extra money for a dlc like this and uh yeah like i said it seems to be a really cool add-on to an already great simulator so we're gonna give it a shot in this video i'm gonna give you my raw impressions because i have not played this expansion before should be fun stay with me if you're on the hunt for ram or storage check out Team Group's Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales happening this month find great deals on your favorite delta RGB and Vulcan z memory and even ultra fast PCI 4.0 cardia SSDs each Monday a new promotional discount will be running for average savings of around 15 so be sure to click the link below to stay informed happy shopping oh yes the pc building simulator it expansion i am super excited so you can start with career you can see we've already had our career mode going on for a good while here but uh the it expansion is what we really want to try out looks like we had a new space as well so it'll be really cool we'll click new game and let's just see what happens again i have no idea what i'm getting myself into you're now an i.t support contractor for ira tech corporation have you played pc building simulator before the answer to that is yes let's see gameplay settings free postage cash and jet reward we don't want any of these i guess these are like handicaps we're not playing with handicaps this is a pretty cool office i really dig it uh the atmosphere is nice i would love to work here plenty of natural light just looks like a little intro message no big deal i t support technician description salary work will be assigned to you and i guess i'm like being contracted here let's see Timbo 2000 hey just wanted to say good luck on your first day blah blah blah blah blah let's see let's get you on boarded bet you can't wait to get started i need you to reinstall typo sellout and document.document reader okay also gotta uninstall cookbooks and a dmine nice now this system looks pretty darn dirty you can see i think the first thing we're going to do is go ahead and blow out all the dust it's really nasty looking much much cleaner now that's what i'm talking about also this is a fractal design case all right not bad yes love that sound i missed it okay so we can hop on over here we need to uninstall cookbooks and data mine those are the two things we need to remove we'll go ahead and take care of these first since they're the only things on here now if you're wondering what that sound is in the background it's like a fan spinning well that's exactly what it is it's just in the game it's not in this room this room is very quiet so uh yeah blame the game not me now we need to install typo sellout and document readers that should be pretty straightforward add programs sell out so how you spell it ah crap i gotta add my usb drive let's see what's another one typo i know we need that one document reader that's the one all right so we'll add this one now we can restart all three should be there so this first task i imagine is just to get your feet wet again get you familiar with the game if you haven't played in a good while i think we've done everything here we just need to reinstall the side panel which is going to be yup this thing here so we'll take care of that and then we can place a delivery area so we'll power it off everything's disconnected i'll take my thumb drive back and all we need to do is just right click and bring it on over here to the delivery area all right now let's see if we get paid for this i think we do collect oh yeah let's delete all of these since we finished them and i think we're good for the day not much else we need to take care of let's go ahead and clock out okay so i guess this is my tablet now the one that natalia said she was sending me we've got two emails here from folks who need work okay what's this one ira says this should be your top priority I think i'll listen to you so the deadline is January 7th that is like two days from now i strongly suggest you upgrade the available memory to 16 gigs i need to fix the computer the power supply seems to have shorted out i'll leave it to your discretion but i can't promise it won't come up in your next performance review jeez this is being held over my head here okay so make sure that the pc can boot to the operating system and replace the power supply that uh that should be fairly straightforward i could give it to the night shift it'll make it their problem but all right all right let's see if we can get this going so we'll set it over here on our test bed this guy walks pretty slow when he's holding these things oh wow that is way smaller than it looked in the box so we can remove this and i don't really see much let's check it out on the other side maybe remove that all right so she said we need to replace the power supply so let's go ahead and remove that uh we do need to disconnect some things first actually we can remove the top panel too okay all right now let's see unplug motherboard unplug ssd is there discrete power running to the graphics card i don't think there is uh let's see we have one more cable there and whatever this is oh that's the eight pin okay cool now we can remove the power supply and we can install oh gosh do i even have one ah crap i gotta order one okay so we gotta get it here uh we need it we need to get here tonight so we'll add this to the cart and we need to check out uh same yeah what same day gonna cost a hundred bucks oh my gosh yeah i think we'll stick with next day she'll be okay we'll still be you know in front of that january 7th deadline at least so we'll click buy so we'll take care of the remainder of this tomorrow she also wants to make sure this boots to the operating system but of course we can't do that until yeah until we get the psu here the other one we need to look at just need a little help with these forums been trying to find the docs for your onboarding but my drive is so cluttered could you install clean it pro and give it a once over for me yeah piece of cake so that's this one yep and we're gonna bring this over to testbed number two is this the same pc from the same guy i just worked on he wants clean it pro installed which is somewhere there it is and nice so we should be good to go now let's double check and uh yeah we just need to complete the case so we'll install the side panel and then power this thing off package it back up easy done so i am pretty sure that was all we had to do today we are just waiting on the replacement power supply to come in so we can go ahead and sign out for now here are goodies next morning so we'll collect these and we'll hop right on over to the system and get this taken care of so we need to install let's see power supplies the new one and we'll place it right there okay now i think it's good i accidentally clicked on the ap and eps one i should not have so we can click power i think we'll get a post this time nice yeah everything is good to go on this one we can go ahead and power down and install the side panels and uh yeah it's ready to go let's collect on our work we've got email see i want to collect on that one nice and collect on this one hey she paid big bucks for that you know she was oh i forgot dang it i forgot that she mentioned the memory oh i hate myself for that so i guess we can go and discard these emails we've got the tablet email we can also discard we are good to go the queue is clean we can sign up for the day oh my gosh we're getting okay i guess this is going to be a normal thing here must complete job by this date so we have deadlines we need to keep track of that's important especially in this business we've got three packages now wow this is this yeah i can see how this could become overwhelming very quickly what do we have on the email side of things uh matt apparently you don't have an id card i need you to install an image editor for me mugshot cc and then i promise i can start your onboarding my computer might need an upgrade to meet the minimum specs the it support onboarding dock says you can use will it run to check the processor is probably fine because the last it guy upgraded it but i don't know about the graphics card also the printers being a total pain in the you know what again it's not urgent but you got it working last time fantastic i'm just uh yeah this is good stuff we're looking for mugshot there we go so it's graphics card yeah so he needs a gtx 1050 ti his 560 is not gonna do we've got one offering here for 155 a few for 165. uh yeah we're just going to go with the evga options we'll add this to cart and well i guess we should wait see this this is part of the strategy here see if i place the order for this now i and i don't know this for sure i'm just guessing this is how the game's gonna want you to do it if i place this order right i have to pay for shipping it's like 30 bucks or whatever i bet i can get a bundled discount on shipping if i order a bunch of things at the same time so i put three different things in the cart that i need for three different machines so i'm actually gonna have to check on the other two systems in the shop that are in the queue and see what i need for those and then maybe i can get them all shipped at a discount right which will save me money which is the goal you want to maximize profit here so i'll leave that in the cart we'll close this for now and we'll check on this other inquiry let's see uh and a better graphics card that seems fairly straightforward notes i'll let you on a secret i play video games okay yes i may own one of the fastest growing tech companies in the world but i just have to unwind like everyone else and sometimes that means playing games during work hours to make sure i'm rested and ready for the next big meeting okay is there anything that you like needs specifically you just want something better than what you have how much are you willing to pay for this because that'll tell me what my budget is yeah 650 bucks okay i think we can work with that you know and i wonder if this game is picky about the size of the hardware going into a case obviously her compact build is going to require a compact graphics card but if i try to put like a very large card in there will it let me do it probably not this game has been surprising me in more ways than one in in good ways i should say and i think it's important that we stay within parameters so let's remove the top left and right side panels her card is yeah this tiny little thing here i don't know i guess it can kind of sit on top of the power supply the way that it is in there so i have to take this bracket out and we can remove this card yeah there's not a lot of space in there at all it is it does have room for a two slot card but uh it might interfere with some things i'm not sure what the tolerances will be so we'll go to our shop and ah crap what does she have what was her graphics card i didn't see it's a gt 1030 okay so pretty much anything is going to be better than a gt 1030. that that clears it up for me if she's a gamer i mean look i could be a nice guy and give her something really powerful but still within her budget i think i'm just gonna go with like an RX 570 or an RX 580 330 320 i can sort by price let's do that uh even a 1050 will be a much better card than what she has i'll i'll be a little nicer than that though we'll go with this one's gonna ah i don't know gtx 1050 ti is quite a lot of those that's a tough one how much do i want to spend on this person should i impress them okay you know what i'm gonna go with this gtx 1060 here it is a three gig card yes but it is small enough to fit in her case i don't know if we have a six gig option in here do we maybe maybe we do yeah so this is a six gig 320 okay all right all right i'll go with this one instead because yeah because it'll fit and it is a six gig buffer and this is a much better choice for gamers than the three gig 1060 option you will saturate that frame buffer very quickly with any modern game now this 30 million from an employee named mia must have something added to my computer my manager said everyone on the team needs document reader installed oh and this is the last thing i swear please get flipside installed that's pretty much it and if you have a spare time my desk is really dusty so i assume the computer is too please so we need a dust and we need to install two programs that should be fairly straightforward so we'll take this third system to the third workstation we'll give it a quick dusting now this is an nzxt what is this h700 h710 pretty cool always takes a while to blow this dust out there we go we're slowly but surely getting there we'll need to add flip side so that'll be easy and then document you on there it is install and we can restart that never gets old i think that's it for this one we just need to place it in the delivery area we'll click the power button and everything's unplugged it'll take my usb drive thank you very much and we'll just lug this thing back over to the delivery area now we're just going to be waiting on stuff to arrive so we'll go back to our shop here let's see if my theory about shipping is great yep see there it is you can save on shipping by buying multiple items at the same time it's more like a flat rate thing than it is like a weight and size thing so that actually is pretty cool did i need i guess i i guess yeah okay so i needed to buy two graphics cards so uh yeah that takes care of that we'll click buy now and we'll see you tomorrow so this guy needed a gtx what was it we need to power this off first this guy needed a gtx 1050 ti he's only got a 560 in here so we'll remove this and then we'll install the 1050 ti here it is it's not okay it's not that one all right sweet so we'll add that and i think it'll be good to go so we can power on we'll add mugshot cc cool and i think i don't know if this is a requirement or not but i think for clean it pro since he didn't ask for that to be on his system i think we need to uninstall that not sure if that'll hurt us or not and we'll go ahead and restart the system whoops i totally meant to uninstall this one instead i'm not sure if you needed cleanup pro anymore but uh yeah this one needs to go right so the system is good to go it's already powered off we can bring this back to the customer same goes for this one all we're going to do here is install the 1060 that we bought so let's be this one here oh it doesn't are you f freaking kidding me oh my gosh you know what though we have this rx 560 here and this is still technically an upgrade from a 1030. it's not um yeah i mean it's it's not as good as a 1060 but it is an upgrade and that was all she was really asking for so we can recycle parts here it's actually pretty efficient we didn't need the 1060 at all this one fits just barely do i have to remove what's what's not fitting in here i gotta remove this pcie slot cover yeah this thing is oddly like it's oddly specific with what it wants okay so now put that in there all righty and i think we can fire her up fantastic so believe that takes care of this system's checklist yes we are good to go we'll just put the side panels on and package it back up and i believe with that we can collect our rewards let's see here we've got uh yeah collect all right my boss is over the moon i am very glad that uh your boss is that's great let's see this one here was the 1050 ti oh is it not it's not it's not good what did i do pc status incomplete incomplete case did i forget to what what did i forget oh crap what did i wha what did i screw up it's got to be something something obvious i think oh i didn't put his left side panel on well so pc parts there we go okay that uh that makes a little more sense we'll bring this back to the delivery area and now we can collect that reward i'm really curious about ira i i really want to know if thank you just a shame you didn't fix the printer crap i keep forgetting these things the printer yes but the printer okay anyway we still got paid and then uh ira let's see what let's see what she thinks here i see you didn't run a virus scan she asked for that oh my gosh ah yes you're right perhaps the malware immediately just needs more time i'll download a few more okay well hey she she's not complaining about the graphics card so um that's a huge profit i mean we only paid 65 bucks in parts and that was because that graphics card was recycled from another system so we profited 585 from that one account that's awesome so we can discard this discard this discard this and oh we've got another deadline here i'm trying to work this pc keeps letting me down here's what i'm thinking could you optimize my drive please it's been a while good luck with that i've got some other little issues too like it'd be good if you ran clean it as well okay so we need to run clean it and we need to run this thing okay so don't forget about the clean it thing i can't forget i always forget the extras so clean it and that disc byte software should be pretty straightforward so let's click start here this is uh probably just going to clean up the system clean up the drive optimization complete and clean it pro this one's also very straightforward now again i don't know if it's a requirement to uninstall these programs i'm not sure if these people care that they're on here i'm just going to remove clean it just just because it's kind of bothering me that it's still there and shiva doesn't need it anymore who knows she might want it but the game doesn't really specify and i believe that is it checklist taken care of we'll power this off and bring it with us to the delivery area this one also i believe had a hard deadline so i'm glad we took care of it swing by here to the emails again and collect all right 170. that was easy i gotta say i'm really impressed with the way that this game handles the uh the it expansion it just seems so organic the next logical step there is quite a bit of overlap but i do notice that there are some differences between this and the original career mode so if you're into something a bit different you've kind of gotten tired of playing the same old thing over and over i think this revitalizes pc building simulator again for those who have been playing for so long most games will get a bit old and kind of just mundane after a while but this expansion and the fact that it's free is already just gold and then it's actually fun it's the icing on the cake so yeah it was really fun if you have not heard of pc building simulator and we'll have it linked below it's not affiliate link or anything it's just a really cool game that us pc builders can relate to if you have that itch you need to scratch building pcs is just a hobby of yours and you want to continue doing it maybe you don't have the funds or necessarily the time you don't want to deal with the messes then play the game the game is it really is almost just as satisfying i've done the free build and and that's also very fun so if you want to kind of play around with different hardware that's baked into the game that's there for you but the it expansion it just it takes things to to another level and it makes you think outside the box you have to keep track of a lot more and the logistics and everything just kind of piles on that makes it fun it makes it a bit stressful but you know it's a game at the end of the day let me know if you think about the game in the comment section below what you think about the expansion if you want to see more videos like this i would appreciate that feedback as well these aren't very difficult to make editing can be a bit annoying because there's so many clips to go through but it is something that i think relates to us personally in this industry it's one of the few games that has that very clear overlap with pc building because that's literally what it is it's a pc building simulator so that is appreciated if you like the video thumbs up consider subscribing and i'll catch you in the next one my name is Greg thanks for building virtually with me yeah that works",

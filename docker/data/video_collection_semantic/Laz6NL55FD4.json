    "transcript": "Hey, how is it going? Dave2D here So, I like the Surface Pro products. I have always liked them, I think they're one of the most versatile computer you can get on the market right now. Like that whole 2-in-one form factor, super cool But there's a couple thing that kinda bug me with about surface pro First is the price point even the base model It's not particularly cheap And the second thing is that Over the years and we're on the fifth generation of Surface Pro products right now And they have not improved that much I mean incremental improvements every year But it's still the same kind of product That it has been since day one And there's nothing wrong with it But it's a pretty conservative approach to the whole 2-in-one tablet thing This is the Eve V And to explain what this product is, I think we have to go a little bit into story time About a year ago, so like July 2016, I was approach by this company And they said, \"Hey Dave, you know you do laptops we wanna send you this product...\" \"...that's gonna be like this laptop killer. It's gonna be industry changing product.\" And at the time I was like, really? You know, this is like an unknown startup company thinks that they can make a product that can be an industry changer? I mean, I'd love to believe it, but send me the product when it's done and I'll gladly take a look at it But I really didn't think anything would come from it Now fast forward one year later and they actually sent me a fully working prototype Now keep in mind, this is a prototype So I'm not gonna do like a full review on it But there's one to go through some my first impressions of it First the device is very similar to a Microsoft Surface It has a kick stand and the even the keyboard looks and feels like a Surface And I think a lot of people could mistake this for some kind special edition Microsoft Surface Pro It's very similar The material is aluminium, it's not magnesium like the Surface lineup But it's still a very solid feeling and it's very well-made Now one the coolest thing about this product is that the whole concept of it was crowd sourced So they asked a ton of people, I think like a thousand people What they would want in a laptop and this thing was born And one of the things people really wanted was good I/O Because the Surface lineup doesn't has a great port selection So we have two USB A's, two USB C's, one of them actually being thunderbolt 3 There's an audio jack that has a good quality amp in there The power switch also has a fingerprint sensor for logging in with Windows Hello There's four speakers that sound pretty clean, a lot better than I thought it would And the display panel looks really nice It's high res, individually calibrated with the factory so it's color accurate right off the box And it comes with the stylus for pen input and stuff And it's compatible with Microsoft Surface Pens if you want They have a few configurations. They're all running Y processors But these guys have done an amazing job cooling it passively So it's fanless. This one is running a Core m3 and the temperatures stay low even when the boost kicks in I could actually play Overwatch at the lowest possible settings It wasn't amazing. I was hovering around 35-40 frames per second But totally playable, and remember, this has a Thunderbolt 3 port So if you wanna go nuts you can connect to an external GPU for games The keyboard is also really nice. This is actually the first 2-in-one keyboard that I've used That has RGB backlighting, you can switch between a few colors Typing is super comfortable The trackpad is good, it's a glass surface with Windows Precision drivers. The inputs on this device are really good But the best part is you can remove it and this RGB backlit keyboard suddenly becomes a wireless keyboard It's got Bluetooth 4.2 in it and it's got a small battery in it So you can control this thing remotely So if you have it connected to a projector, or for like presentation whatever That's a pretty cool feature Now the battery in the main device, 48 watt hours It's bigger than the Surface Pro 4 from last year, it's similar in size with the new Surface pro from 2017 The Eve V is heavier by around 100 grams or so, I think a lot of the weight comes from beefier heatsink And I'm not gonna lie, I think the extra the weight is noticeable But even if you hold it one handed, it's an extremely comfortable tablet to hold Now, the cameras on this thing aren't as good as the Surface Pro So if image quality on your tablet is important to you then this is probably not the best product for you Another thing the stylus has less pressure levels But for me, these are things I don't care to much in a tablet There's all these features about the Eve V that are pretty cool So, like the fingerprint sensor, the RGB keyboard, Thunderbolt 3 The average guy that walks in the Microsoft Store Like the business guy or whatever that goes in there looking for a 2-in-1 tablet They don't care about these feature So Microsoft isn't gonna put these feature into their tablets anytime soon But these are the features that you guys and myself included, like the enthusiast level guys We like this stuffs And this is the type the stuff that makes this product special. Now, the pricing of it is very fair It starts at $800 which is the same price as the base price of the New Surface Pro But the Eve product include a keyboard and you're getting 8 gigs of RAM instead of 4 So I think you're getting a solid device for the money Now just to be clear, I'm not saying that the Surface Pro is garbage in comparison to this Not at all. I think the Surface Pro is a fantastic product And it's a good fit, a better fit for some people than this But if you're in the market for 2-in-1 I would say, \"Hold off on the purchase on the Surface Pro...\" \"...that's what you can get...\" \"...Let this thing come out in the market, let it kind of proliferate, let the review come out...\" Because I think for a lot of people, this is a better fit than the Surface Pro. You're getting better value for the money, and it's just a more enthusiast level product than the Surface Pro is Okay hope you guys enjoy this video, thumbs if you like it, subs if you love it, I'll see you guys next time",

    "transcript": "hey guys this is why there's a traffic jam on the world's highest mountain climbing Mount Everest is pretty universally recognized as the ultimate challenge that a climber can accomplish along do you ignore k2 again every year hundreds flock to Everest in an attempt to join an elite club of adventurers as we need to be only around 4,800 people who've ever summited the world's highest mountain over the last couple weeks however 11 people have died during their climb making this one of these dead list years for Everest in large part those deaths have been caused by a massively growing issue traffic a couple weeks ago a photo went viral which showed a queue of dozens of climbers waiting to reach the summit all while taking selfies of course for those of you living under a mountain Mount Everest is the highest elevation on the planet located in between Tibet and Nepal its peak ever stands at an incredible 29,029 feet or 8,848 meters no people getting injured or even dying on Everest is nothing new in fact there have been hundreds of deaths since its first official expeditions began in 1922 the deadliest was in 2015 when a 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit Nepal causing a massive avalanche that killed 22 people a year prior 16 Sherpas died in another Avalanche Sherpas really are the real heroes here with a lifetime of mountaineering experience and they're the ones who were carrying the gear setting up the camps and all the rope lines and without the Sherpas CEO Chad certainly is not making it up the mountain the most famous incident was in 1996 when a group got caught in a storm which killed 8 people in a single day and four more of the group died during the descent Jon Krakauer who is one of the survivors of that team went on to write a book about their expedition into thin air which one fact was the basis for the movie Everest in 2015 in his book crocodile attributed the disaster to poor planning severe weather and climber congestion which is pretty much the same story as today the way Everest works is that there are several camps at various points of the mountain where it is relatively safe to rest however after climbers get above around 25,000 feet the reach wood is referred to as the dead zone and that's just not a cute nickname most people who have died on Everest have done so inside that dead zone this is where air starts to thin and oxygen becomes scarce trance cursors to the point where there's not for a human to properly breathe this obviously leads to a number of health issues including asphyxiation which is not fun known as altitude sickness a lack of oxygen to the brain can cause severe dizziness or even hallucinations trouble moving and paired judgment also less oxygen and your blood makes it easier to contract frostbite so I actually did my own climb although August obviously not Everest a few years ago when we did the Highlander with lioness and a bunch of other tech people it was cool but we're all wildly and experienced and honestly we came very close to having some serious issues the weather got bad we were carrying people down I mean people were way way out of shape and obviously is not this same kind of scenario that you find on Everest but it is not something to play with and the issue is that a lot of these climbers who are going up the mountain right now are mildly experienced at best and simply have a big checkbook and a lot of Sherpas to help them up which is a super super dangerous scenario veteran climbers spend weeks acclimating to these types of conditions prior to their expedition but still almost everyone relies on portable oxygen tanks to reach the very top the summit if you will and the problem is that you can only carry so many tanks with you up to mountain climbers reportedly spent hours waiting in line to reach the summit which they obviously didn't plan for when their rationing their oxygen tanks at a point like this you should turn around but the impaired judgment kicks in which says oh you know I mean so far I want to make it and a lot of people feel like they just have no choice but to stand in line as their oxygen tank runs almost empty less you're considering that now that you have to make it to the top but importantly you have to make it back down so how does a mountain even get a traffic jam well there are a few factors well there are 15 total recognized routes up the mountain the vast majority of climbers use just two one the Tibet side and want on the Nepal side Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world and relies heavily on the hundreds of millions of tours of dollars that ever springs then as a result the issue as many permits as possible to hopeful thrill-seekers this year they issued a record three hundred and eighty-one Everest permits on the other hand Tibet requires climbers to have already summited an eight thousand meter mountain prior to being issued a permit they also limit the number of permits of the issue per season something that Nepal doesn't really do as they don't have this restriction they pretty much issue a permit to anyone who provides a clean bill of health from a doctor and somewhere between eleven and twenty thousand dollars how much up to twenty thousand dollars mountain yeah that's a problem in that's definitely a problem there's nothing to do with your lack of elite climbing skills I know the big factor for this gym is the weather in the winter powerful jet streams make reaching the summit extra difficult in the summer there's monsoon season for the most part everest really is only accessible in spring usually making may be prime time to reach the summit because the area around the peak is incredibly narrow it creates a bottle like for the hundreds of climbers that are all riving at once so it's hard to kind of wrap your head around just how small the summit actually is I mean sure you can make it almost to the top but anyone who's put in that much money that much time that much effort into some budding Everest wants to say they stood on the actual top and especially when you're considering that it's like an area the size of a small room it means that there can be a huge traffic jam when everyone is forced to climb on like one or maybe two days per year I mean some climbers were forced to stay put for hours on end and in that dead zone every minute counts which is a huge factor on why this has been one of the deadliest years on record Nepal denies that the number of permits is the cause of the issue and they've gone on record that they do not have plans to limit the number of future permits this is certainly a problem which is not going to go away and likely will continue to get worse until someone decides it's not a good idea let CEO Joe climb the world's tallest mountain with essentially no room for error thank you very much for watching this episode of this is make sure to subscribe and check out some of these other videos here and if you don't ring that the notification bell Matt will be forced to carry my oxygen tanks up to the top of Mount Everest sure",

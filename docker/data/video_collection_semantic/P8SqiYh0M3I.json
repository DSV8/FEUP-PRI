    "transcript": "- Welcome to an updated office tour guys. You've been requesting this for quit some time and I'm basically making this because I am very shortly going to be redoing my office, yet again. Just when I get it to the point where I'm super excited, I love how it's working out, I go and get crazy and make some changes. So right now this is my current office set-up that I have. When you first walk in, this is my unboxing station. So we've got three lights, we've got two light panels One. Two. and we've got this LiteMat Plus 4 which I am obsessed with. This is all future things that I need to unbox. This is fire hazard and here's a little area where I charge a bunch of batteries. So, yeah. Spoiler alert. Here's the electrical tape that I use to tape my microphone to my body. It's pretty painful. Here's a scissors that I use to cut the electrical tape to put the microphone on my body. These are the two cameras that I use to do all of my unboxing stuff here at this desk. These are the a7SII's. So on this main camera I'm using an 18-35 but actually I usually use a 25-70 but I was traveling and I took that one with me and I haven't replaced it. I've been rotating my second camera out with my a7III but I'm filming with it right now. On this one is a 35mm but in most of my newer videos I've been using the 18-105. I've a small HD focus right here. This one is one of their newer ones and I love it cause it is touch screen and it's also super small and tiny for travel. And over here we've got another small HD. I'm recording all of this video live, so I'm kind of filming and talking at the same time that's why it might be a little bit silly. I've also got knives stashed pretty much every place that you could imagine because obviously when you do unboxings you need to have some good knives. Super dangerous. Super safe. As we venture away from the unboxing desk we have my dog, Matty. Hi Matty, do you wanna play some Xbox? Do you want to play Fortnight? Matty, what do you think about Fortnight? This is where I play Xbox. It's sitting extremely close to the couch because I like to lounge here. The Xbox is actually under the couch. I'm not really proud of this set-up but it's extremely comfortable and sometimes I will actually game on my LG TV back here. But when I'm playing first person shooter games I much rather prefer sitting on the couch, lounging and sitting very close to a TV. So I don't have to have my contacts in. It makes sense in my mind. So I've divided my room in to two sections. This over here is the PC side, and this is the Mac side. Over here on the Mac side we've obviously got two of my favorite drinks we've got La Croix, Yerba Mate. This thing is kinda cool it does connect to A-l-e-x-a. We've got an Echo Spot, a nice candle, hard drive with a 3D print of my dog and three of my favorite Lego mini figures. We've got Benny, we've got Steve Jobs and myself. Of course the 18 core Mac which I am obsessed with. This razor mouse pad is probably one of my new favorites. Oops. The best photo ever of me, Jenna and Susie in Hawaii. And there's another hard drive back there of course. More hard drives, original iPhone, Homepod. Play me some music. - Tuning in your personal radio station. - Oh no what's it gonna be? - First up, Taylor Swift. - Oh. Okay. Mophie Wireless Charger and of course each side of the office is quite readily equipped with a Star Wars lamp. These are all Hue lights so I can change these colors very easily with my phone. So in the middle here is just this entertainment console which I don't entirely have set up yet. We've got a printer which I fight with quite frequently. We've got my favorite collectible Xbox 360. This is the Starwars one and it's so cool. Of course the white Xbox console because sometimes my sister and I both sit on this couch and game together. So we set up a duel station. (whispers) Matty. This isn't all entirely set up yet cause I do want to take my Playstation and put this under here. The Xbox that's under the couch will also go here when I play on the TV. We'll forget about that one. More really terrible cable management. Playstation Pro. I've got my surface keyboard, and this actually doesn't belong over here. That's my Mac keyboard. Surface mouse, surface travel mouse. Microphone for when I need to record V.O over here. This is actually really cool. This is one of the Stream Decks and this is a white Stream Deck. It's a concept. Most of the Stream Decks they have now are black. So they sent me this white one and they're like what d'ya think? And I said I love it! It matches my aesthetic perfectly. You guys saw me unboxing the pink razor accessories before in another video. I think it looks so good, like it looks great. I absolutely love the look of it. Oh it's looking for me. Can you see me, I'm looking at you. Do I've to get lower? (singing) and Shawty got low, low, low, low Oh look. (singing) apple bottom jeans So here's the Stream Deck turned on. What do you guys think of the white? I think it looks great. Ya look so beautiful. Of course the lilac S9 to match the pink aesthetic over here. Here's two archive drives that're full of just random goodies. And here's my surface book. This thing, I've been traveling everywhere with in addition to my MacBook and using it to play Fortnight. Shoes. Shoes. And I forgot to mention my mini consoles. Ugh they're so beautiful. When I do wanna play these I just move them right over to here. (Whispers) Matty Hey, Matty. You need to be more excited about this movie that we're making. Did you just wink at me? Oh my god you just winked. Here is my travel backpack. Chairs. Oh, this over here is a future video. This is one of my MacBooks from 2006. One last thing, I have got this cabinet of magical goodness. There's a bunch of random things. We've got tripods, surge protectors, playstation accessories, Snapchat sunglasses. GoPro, hard drive chargers, Nintendo accessories, gaming audio, microphones. Lots of HDMI. Lots. So in here we have also got more cords. My Apple Watch bands, Apple Watches. I love the Google clips. My iPhone 3GS box, lots of power bricks. Phones, phones, phones. Phone cases. Audio accessories. This is also a future video I'm so excited about it. This was a past video, get in to it. More various accessories. We've got travel adapters. We've got gadgets, gizmos, webcams. In here is where we have all of my cables organized by, oh that's upside down. Micro USB, miscellaneous, mini, USBC and under there is some more. Here's some travel bags, backup head set. Wow. That's it. Goodbye. Well thank you guys for watching. I have absolutely no idea what this video looks like because I'm filming it and the microphone that I have on here is extremely heavy so I feel like I have been shaking this whole time trying to hold this tripod and this camera and this microphone up at the same time. Anyway I just wanted to show you guys my office. You guys always are asking about what I have made changes to and what my current work space looks like so this is it. It will be changing very soon but I'm very excited about the changes. Hopefully it'll be sooner than later . (whispers) Hi Matty. Wow, I don't know if you guys heard that but he just let out a huge sigh. I'll see you guys in my next video. Buh-bye.",

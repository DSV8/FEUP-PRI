    "transcript": "- That's right, it's your resident e-ink boy, other than James, the other guy that looks like me, to talk about another e-ink tablet. This one's called the Bigme. I wanna say the model name, but we are unclear as to what the model name actually is. We'll get into that, but the key feature here, that you should be interested in, is the color. This is an e-ink tablet running Android with a color e-ink screen. I don't know if I've ever seen a color e-ink screen in person. So, this is gonna be experience for me and for you. Come along. Oh, just for me? What? This is a weird stylus. Okay, it's thick, it's like thicker. When I did the Boox, I noted that, like the Apple pencil, it was kind of the perfect size, 'cause it feels like pencil size. But this one is thicker, this is like a thick pencil And it's got three buttons on it. I do not know what those buttons do. But, what I do know, is that this stylus has 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity. Which seems to be the only number I ever say for stylus' is, are there other levels? But, now I'm curious, there's a, like a, is that a connector on the end? There's a smart connector there, or a POGO pin, or whatever you call that. It's a mystery hole. Okay, let's take a look at this tablet. Bigme. Once again, just for me. And, in fact, that is me. Right there, they drew a picture. They missed the mustache, and the glasses, and the hair color is off. Okay, so it turns out that a e-ink color screen just looks like a regular screen, but we're- That's a joke. We're gonna turn it on. We're gonna look at all that. But first, I wanna look at the outside. So, interestingly, we have a power button that also looks like a fingerprint reader. Confirmation? It is a fingerprint reader, and it's on the left side of the tablet. The other one that we opened, I was like, \"Okay, this is taking some real cues from iPads.\" This one's like, \"You know what?\" \"We know iPads would have the power button on this side.\" \"We're not doing that, okay, we're different.\" We've got what look like four microphones on the top. On this side, we've got the connector for the stylus. I'm just gonna throw that on there right now. Okay, that is scary. Look at that. I mean, it's magnetic. And there's magnets over here as well, to keep it there. But, oh, my goodness, look at this. Wow. Moving on. On the bottom, we have, okay a USB type C port. And, what I'm guessing is not a sim card slot like I thought last time. - [Bell] It is. - Oh, it is a sim card slot. - [Bell] And a microSD. - On the back, we have, ooh, it's like a frosted glass looking aesthetic. Plus a camera of some kind that, probably, going to be for scanning documents. Now, before we turn it on, there's an accessory box that I already kind of disassembled. USB type C to A. No charger, though, interestingly. You can figure that out on your own. Apple style. It also came with these- Why are there two different pins for the sim card slot? You can put 'em on your key chain. They got little holes. Now, also, in this accessory box, is this little doo hickey that I have no idea what that is. Is it something to do with the stylus? I don't think so. Oh, these are tips for the stylus. This is like a little pincer thing, so you can pull the tip off. - [Bell] Didn't watch the Kindle Scribe video. - Look at that! That's an entirely novel thing to me. You know, you think you've seen it all, and then you encounter a stylus tip puller. Thank you, Bigme, for giving me this opportunity to learn something. That's very big of you. I thought it was big of me. Stop. Documentation. Oh, it calls the speaker \"horn.\" I made a mistake. On the- Hello? On the bottom, or the left side, I guess, of the tablet, we got two, I call them speakers. They're not speakers. They're actually called horns. Magnetic absorption charging port of elec- What? That's what they call the magnetic charging connector. They call the stylus tips \"cartridges.\" And then, this thing is a \"cartridge clip.\" Let's read some books, baby. Oh, and then, lastly, this folio thing. Good E Reader. Oh, it's magnetic. It should be magnetic, but the magnets are on this side, instead of like, an iPad, the magnets are on the back. And then the folio attaches to the back magnetically. But there's no magnets on the back. I don't know how to give you the angle, but there's two little holes in the folio there. It's got kind of like a silky feel. All right, let's clear this, all this stuff off, and I'm gonna turn it on and find out exactly how much having a color e-ink screen adds to your experience after this message from our sponsor. Thank you dbrand, for sponsoring this video, I guess. They're a bunch of weirdos, but they do make some pretty cool stuff. I know for a fact that their grip case is called the grip case because it's kind of grippy. And like, you'd think they'd come up with something like a little bit more creative. For example, it's impact resistant. So, you could call it something like, \"indestructible case,\" or something. Or like, \"the punchable case.\" Or \"punchable company.\" The grip case can also be customized with any of dbrand's skins, including the new pallets collection they just released. - [Bell] Why are you saying it like that? - What? - [Bell] Pallets. - Pallets? Check out dbrand at ShortLinus.com. Maybe you click it 'cause it's funny. What am I looking at here? Is this the home screen? This doesn't look like the home screen. Does it have gestures? What? Home. Is this Android? This looks like the app interface of one of the apps that I used on the other, on the Boox. Okay, I just need to get my bearings here. I don't even know where I am. What is this thing? There's a little, oh. I need that pen. - [Bell] That could be the missing link. - Oh, no, there's not a home button. There's a power button on the pen. And, do I hold it? It's outta battery. What is this, what's this button? This went to- It got rid of the sidebar. This is very confusing, 'cause this is a different brand and they're using a custom Android skin, obviously. But like design of the UI looks very, very similar to the Boox, but it seems like the UI is different than the Boox. Jake brought up that I should explain why the UI is so confusing. Android has a design that is already fairly user friendly. So, when you reinvent the wheel, and try to make it completely different, it better be more user friendly. If you're coming up with something different, make it similarly user friendly, because this is just confusing. I don't know where, I guess this is the home screen. No, even clicking the home button won't take me away from offline books. How do I just go back to the apps? I don't know. That's the end of my rant about the UI, okay? That's all I'm gonna say. So, we got dark enhancement. What? Whoa, whoa. Okay, let's put that back down. Refresh mode, let's go to top fast refresh mode just so I can use the thing. Vivid enhancement, okay, that's a little bit better. Wow, look at that latency, though. I feel like that's worse than the Boox. Color brightness, give it all the way. Give me all the, what, that looks like it got less bright. That doesn't seem to do anything, adjusting the color brightness. Okay, time to go over some specs and stuff that I didn't quite hit the first time. This is a 10.3 inch screen and the resolution, I guess, of the screen, is 1872 by 1404. But that's only in black and white mode. In color mode, which I'm in right now, it's less. It's quite a bit less. It looked significantly, like, fuzzier when I upped the refresh rate. The other thing I should mention right now is that there's a front camera as well. There's a back camera that we saw, and there's a front camera here that I didn't even see the first time around. Five megapixel on the front. Eight megapixel on the back. Which, frankly, I feel like you- I would want the higher megapixel count on the front since it's like, am I gonna be walking around taking photos of other people with this? Can I not switch to the front camera? Okay, I'll just take a photo of you guys. Ready? This is so weird again. All right, wow. Okay, so we are in color mode right now. I wanna switch to black and white. How do I do that? What is this pause button up here? Apply split screen. Oh, that's not a pause button, that's split screen, okay. Oh, it has dual tone as well. Okay, because people got really upset that I had the yellow backlight on the whole time last time. We're gonna have the cool backlight there. There we got full and half, all right? Is everyone happy with this? Are we happy with this color? You let me know. So now, I'm gonna fly through some of the features of the device. I mean, just like, just take the point that the UI of this Android implementation is very confusing, okay? Now, take that, and then we're gonna talk about the more important stuff. Are you ready? Let's go. So, as far as we can understand, this tablet uses a processor using eight arm Cortex A-53 cores, which is kind of an older core, you know? You don't need a crazy amount of power for, to run e-ink applications. Although I could, I wish this thing had some more of something, I don't know if it's processing power. Before I get any more lost in the weeds, I'm gonna open up a book, okay? In the book reading interface, if you tap in the middle, you got your e-ink in controls. At the very least, that came up. In the Boox, nothing came up. I couldn't figure out how to bring up the actual controls. I like the clarity. I mean, obviously, the clarity will depend. I mean, it could be the case of, when we were trying to figure out how to like turn off the color, like you were saying, it could be the case that the sharpness just kind of increases a little bit when you're not looking at anything with color in it, which might be the case here. Let's say, if I bring that up again, everything's to zero. Dark enhancement. Yeah, I could use a little bit more contrast. It's, there we go. I like that a little bit better than the default. No complaints about the actual physical like, look of the text. Let's go to the notes app. I appear, it looks like I've turned on the stylus, I think. I clicked the power button and it it beeped red a few times. And it's got some pressure sensitivity. I'm not getting any- Whoa, I'm feeling like resistance on different parts of the screen. Like, it's smooth, and then bump, bump, bump. Bump, bump, bump, bump. I'm feeling bumps on the screen as I drag the stylus across. This is so confusing. So, we got pen, we got range, which I guess means- Okay, range means select. I can select something to delete. Sure. Okay, we got shapes. Rectangle. Oh, it just makes a rectangle, and then I can adjust the size. Am I on the fast refresh rate? I am, wow, I'm on the top fast refresh rate, and this is really choppy. There we go, we got options to change the type of drawing. Let's go to the brush and we will draw in red. This is what's so interesting to me about e-ink screens. It's like, it can't handle giving me a real time preview as I, of when I'm dragging the rectangle to be a different size. But when I draw, it's like perfectly fine to like give me the input of the pen on screen as soon as I draw it. If someone understands exactly how e-ink screens work, put something in the comments about why the whole screen has to like struggle when I change the size of a rectangle. Why it can just like render the output of the pen right away. Does it have- It has palm detection or whatever? I'm writing notes. I will say that, the writing feel, it does feel more like writing on paper than it does that you're writing on an actual e-ink screen. And I feel like I can kind of put pressure on it. That's like one of the issues with tablets and like using stylus'. Every time I use a stylus with a tablet, depending on the display, maybe they're better at this now, but you feel as if you're gonna like break the display when you press on it. But, with this one, I can actually feel like I can rest my hand on it and I don't feel like I'm gonna like, break something. And, also, when you press on the screen it doesn't give you that like, distortion around the the tip of the pen that you sometimes see with like LCD displays. I guess YouTube is already on here. We're gonna try and run \"Crab Rave.\" (upbeat music) Okay. I hope the viewers pick up on my frustration with this because, you know, watching the video, I will say, that I'm pleasantly surprised at how fast the refresh rate is. We don't know the actual herz number of this because, you know, it's been hard enough to find the actual name of the product. But, I am sort of impressed with like, you know, you can watch- (upbeat music) It's enough to kind of get the gist of what's going on in the video. I will say, the speakers are bad. There's a thing for office. There's voice controls. Oh, and I can scroll, and there's more stuff going on. There's voice translation. Good e-reader, I guess, is their like, store for books. Oh, no, you can buy actual products here. They have a store app to like buy more products from all sorts of, they have Amazon Kindle Scribe. They have a shopping app. Okay, this is a shopping app for- Do you see what I mean? Logo customization. What is that? Help me out here. It's done loading. Oh, nope. The loading bar went to the end, and then it went back. Is this just, customer case. If you have questions you can contact Bigme888 on WeChat, okay? And, there, you have a telephone number. Okay, make me a logo. I'm gonna draw a book. Oh, this is not- I thought this was a place for you to draw, but it's not. This is- This feels like I was having a trippy dream and then I became lucid in the middle of it and I'm trying to like talk to people in the dream, and they're saying things, but the things that they're saying don't make any sense, because I'm having a dream. So, they'd be like, \"Morning, good, and we had, lunch I was having later, to go inside the car?\" And it's, like it could be a sentence, but it's nonsensical. All right, I'm down here because unboxing this product was exhausting. Thank you, Bigme, for sending what we think is, we're pretty sure, is called the e-ink no color. Overall, the, each individual experience in the tablet was okay. Using the notes app itself. Once I kind of figured out where everything was, that was okay. Using the e-reader app was okay. Somewhat impressed with the refresh rate. Speakers suck. But, overall, my takeaway from this tablet is that the UI is horrible and I could learn how to use it, but it would take a long time. I would say, don't get this product, because, unless you're willing to spend a number of hours learning how to use it when it's an Android device, and it probably should be more easy to use. It's $700. So, that's too much. If you wanna see more unboxings of things that make a little bit more sense, on Short Circuit, subscribe. Hey, go watch the Boox tablet that I unboxed, because that one made a little bit more sense. Quite a bit more sense.",

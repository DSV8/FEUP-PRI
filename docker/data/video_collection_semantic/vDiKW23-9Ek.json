    "transcript": "- Nature. - [Man] Tasty, oh my God. Spit that out James. You, no you didn't. - I'm a vegetarian mother (beep). - Valve has given developers access to the beta for Steam Cloud Play. It's unclear exactly what those new services will look like for consumers, but here's what we know. Steam cloud play can apparently integrate cloud streaming services into your Steam library. Allowing you to launch services like GeForce Now from Steam. Okay, but why would you want to do that instead of just using GeForce Now regularly or streaming from your own PC using Steam roleplay? Well the key difference here seems to be that Steam Cloud Play could involve streaming games, not from your own PC or in video servers, but from servers hosted by Valve. Why do I care? It also looks like Steam Cloud Play integration could help services like GeForce Now expand their library of supported games, that would be nice. If it's super easy for publishers to opt in via Steam platform. The news comes just as GeForce Now is actually getting some triple A games from Ubisoft back on the platfrom through the Epic Games store. But lets be real hey guys, no one owns those games on EGS. We all just claim the free games. Thank you Fortnite. - [Man] We're not gonna buy it, if we don't have to. - Okay, we're gonna talk about Trump and Twitter now, okay? But you gotta keep it chill okay. Lets all just (breathing in) This week has seen a tense confrontation between Twitter and U.S President Donald Trump, over a number of his tweets. It started on Tuesday when Twitter pinned a fact checking-link to one of Trump's tweets. In which he claimed that Mail-In Ballots will lead to election fraud. Then on Thursday, Trump signed an executive order directing the FCC and FTC to investigate whether new regulations could be placed on social media giants like Twitter and Facebook, which would effectively turn them into publishers, which are liable and could be sued for the content they host, instead of merely platforms, which are not liable for said content. Currently, Twitter and Facebook are protected from liability by section 230 of the communications indecency act. There's plants in my mouth. Which both Trump and Joe Biden want to overturn. It's unclear what an order like this would accomplish for Trump as Twitter might be more incentivized to remove sensitive tweets if they are liable for hosting certain content. Which is the very thing that prompted this whole debacle in the first place! - [Man] How Ironic! - I don't get it. While Twitter is going head to head with the president, Mark Zukerburg apparently wants to just stay out of it. Robots they don't like drama, Zuckerburg said in an interview that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth, even though the platform has been fact-checking posts about the American election and the COVID-19 pandemic. We'll have to wait and see what the future of social media looks like but on the bright side, at least you can now schedule tweets on desktop again. - [Man] Yay! - Again, not now. - [Man] Later. - Yeah in the future. - [Man] Yeah. - Now for some lighter news; HP has unveiled the reverb G2 headset for desktop powered VR and it might have just knocked the index out of the best VR headset thrown. It's 599 US with a per eye resolution of 2160 by 2160 that's a square. The index panels are just 1440 P. Its got 9 gigahertz refresh rate, and a field of view around 114 degrees. Although, field of view is dependent upon a number of factors so it's hard to describe with a single number. Riley, everybody knows that. (man laughing) But Valve apparently isn't scared of the headset's success, they actually worked with HP to develop it and you can see that in the G2's speakers. Which look like they were taken right off an index. Microsoft also helped HP. They developed the units new windows mixed reality controllers, which come with the headset. The Reverb G2 uses insight to tracking, no base station is required. So we'll have to see whether Linux looks just as silly playing Beat Saber wearing this thing instead of the index. Now its time for the quick pit, brought to you by XSplit Vcam. All the letters It can remove, replace, and blur your screening background without a green screen. And it works with any web cam dammit any one! So there's no need for complicated lighting setups. This isn't film school, its the internet gosh darn it! You can customize the background to anything you want. And it works with other broadcast tools, and even messaging apps like Slack, Hang out, Skype, and more. XSplit promises 24/7 support and life time updates for as little as 3995 for a life time license or 995 for a three months. That's three bucks a month, that's like a coffee or a flapjack. You can also use code LINUSTECHTIPS to get 10% off, so do that at the link below. This is like free in America. Quick base, (clearing throat) What's up. Hey, did you buy this $370 dollar USB stick that promises to protect you from 5G radiation? Well I'm sorry, you're an idiot. No refunds. You see, it doesn't actually use quantam hollographic catalyzer technology for the balance and harmonization of the harmful effects of imbalance electrical radiation at all. It doesn't do anything, because its a 128 megabyte USB key with a sticker on it and you should've known. Shame on you and your country which poorly educated you. And the companies in your country that let you be in a filter bubble. Samsung had officially unveiled a new version of the Galaxy Book S, featuring an intel lake-field processor instead of the qualicom 8CX arm chipset. If it's good, the first lake-field laptop could prove arm doesn't have a future of fit in lights after all. And intel really needs a wedge right now, so come on guys, look into your hearts. I think I saw them last night outside a bar, just sitting on the curb crying into their Budweiser, And they're not supposed to bring the glasses outside. Nvidia has launched Quadro Experience. A Windows app that fulfills many of the same functions for PC's running Quadro graphers cards as the GeForce Experience app does for systems with gaming folk as GeForce cards. So I guess you're not gonna download it either. You just can record 4K footage, get driver updates, and optimize games. But don't forget, you can run games on a Quadro too. You are just if you do that well, you're just spending a lot more to do that. Russians, that's how Hilary Clinton says, the Russians are hacking our emails. The NSA says a division of the Russian Military code named Sandworm, very dune, has been attacking email servers that run the extra mail transfer agent. Its an agent. Which is used in both private and Government organizations. Hopefully, this naming and shaming will get IT managers to issue purchase but you know, the most effective way to kill a sandworm? - [Man's voice] What is it? - It's a spoilers - [Man's voice] I thought you would know dun! How do you kill them? - I can't even respond to that without spoilers. - [Man] Jeeez! - And an app by Yamaha, called Remote Cheerer, will let sports fans who are watching matches from home to connect to giant speakers in the stadium so they can cheer on their teams from a far. But the players won't hear your actual voice. Fans will choose from a preset selection of cheers, boos, and rhythmic claps. That's probably for the best. I host chances this is a recipe for the biggest zoom bomb ever. This is so stupid, - [Man] Come on ref, ooooh! - Like if there's not a good turn out then people in the sound board, are just like turn it up anyway. - [Man] They are like the cheering is on. - They really like you. That's enough of this nonsense, come back on Monday for more Tech news and maybe we'll have a building. Will have to survive on plants! - [Man] Don't do it James. How do you feel? - I'm good, prickly leaf exclusive. This is actually the best leaf I've eaten.",

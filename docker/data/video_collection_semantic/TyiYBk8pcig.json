    "transcript": "it was only a matter of time people one of the most popular gaming minds from logitech g502 gets a wireless upgrade they've been doing such a good job of breaking down the stigma surrounding wireless peripherals and gaming in terms of battery life and sensor performance and their current wireless army portfolio is plenty satisfactory and so this is my experience with the g502 Lightspeed Wireless enjoy after this damn what I provide TX system you run and this is an ATX machine you mean micro idea no no full sized ATX components it's just a small package it can still satisfy the Q 500 l by Coolermaster and affordable and the pretty compact enclosure for all your regular hardware with perforated exterior and PSU bracket the chips up-and-down flexible signed IO and awesome cable management the Q 500 l a compact frame with full ATX satisfaction check it out below alright so let's get the technicals out of the way first among the entire wireless army from large tech this one is a bit on the heavier side at 114 grams with the option to add 16 more grams with these new weight systems keeping true to the original design either adding 8 grams to the back of the mouse and or distributing smaller 2 gram weights around the center balance for people who love a heavier Mouse under the hand this is awesome but I still prefer the lightweight champion the G pro Wireless that is the same price by the way over the g502 Lightspeed and of course this is for all my FPS goodness where as I'm totally fine using the g502 for editing and like some more critical things but aim wise I'm more comfortable with lighter and as usual all the mice will be linked in the description below if you check out thank you very much now despite it looking the same with the side textures and the glossy buttons everything under the hood is actually totally new to make it even lighter versus the wired version so the fan-favorite hyper scroll wheel is now rubberized and fitter with super tactile scroll steps and the same activation for hyper scroll the bottom magnetic plate is smaller to reveal our weight compartment there's also the cover for the USB receiver area and if you have a power-play mat this where you insert the power park that charges the mouse whenever it's on the powerplay mat oh my god that is a lot of power and honestly I would be okay for them not to include the power plate compatibility and lowering the price of it the G logo is now slightly larger with all the same RGB goodness and the buttons are on the right places with dpi up and down browser switches and the sniper button or dpi shift is slightly too forward for my grip style but if we okay for larger hands also by default you can check the battery status with the g9 key that gives us a color code everything is remarkable as usual and you can save your profiles to the mouse itself but that is for some reason inside the gear settings and the DPI shift speeds are adjusted in one increments for really precise customization on that wonderful hero 16k sensor and that's what we've seen on all their flagship wireless mice so far plus the hero ditions or the g pro and the g502 literally there's nothing bad to say about its performance there's no filtering no acceleration zero smoothing so you basically get raw tracking throughout the entire full range of dpi and the only disadvantage here is the lack of any lift off distance adjustment which is not really an issue at lower dpi but it might become a little bit too jerky at higher dpi settings as for battery life this thing is rated at 48 hours of continuous usage which means for my activity I can go for a whole week eight hours a day on a single charge the sensor is super efficient and shuts down whenever it's not in use and so the only culprit here is that RGB illumination logo it's consuming more power than the sensor while in use oh and the cable included here is very nice but giving the deep housing for that micro USB port at the front don't lose the cable and so I remember using the g502 proteus spectrum the original one and you thinking it was my favorite Mouse because I loved the shape I love the buttons I love the scroll wheel and the weight at the time was not really an issue it provided a little bit more stability for my desktop operations but as mice got smaller as my mice got lighter and wireless I've actually never looked back but I can totally see the appeal of the g502 wireless 4 to replace the original for many users and for casual gaming the weight is not really for me but I do feel slightly locked down and less free with my aim versus the total control that I feel with my flicks on the G pro wireless or the original G pro Mouse perhaps I've just gotten totally used to the simplified shape and not really fanned this whole complex design you know some years ago I was totally into that but now with this like the more economic shape and much lighter body and the same price - I would say that for most people if you have $150 for Mouse definitely consider the G Pro wireless instead unless of course you've been using the original G502 and really love the shape want to stick with it and then of course the g fiber - Wireless would be satisfactory but having said all that the launch tech G305 is still my top favorite Wireless recommendation for Mouse because of its shape because of its battery life because what's wait at 99 grams and you can further reduce that by using a lithium battery and the price do it only $60 you cannot go wrong and if the G502 wireless was slightly cheaper to separate itself from the end game that there's the G Pro wireless then I would say you'd have better chances but for now I would recommend the G / Wireless all the way all right I don't mean to disappoint and I know there are many people who love the g502 for exactly what it is it's like your heavier Mouse a bit more complicated shape cool design that hyper scroll wheel button as well but if you could look beyond the horizon especially at that $150 price point then definitely consider other options thanks for watching i'll tell you guys next week",

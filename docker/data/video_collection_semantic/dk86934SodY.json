    "transcript": "- Hello and welcome to 'This Is', Ken - Yeah - What do we got here? - So, we have three X-Box gaming headsets. All of these came out at roughly around the same time and they work specifically, at least in terms of features with X-Box in mind. - Yes. - And specifically the one that I want to draw your attention to today. I mean, these two are really good and all but these are a little peculiar. So, this is a Bang and Olufsen gaming headset it is the Beoplay Portal and it costs $500. - Whoa! No, no! Why would anyone pay $500 for a gaming headset? - That is a good question. - Now, you have tried all of these on the Xbox side, right? - [Host] Correct. - And tell me, is there anything that's special about these $500 pair of gaming headphones compared to the other two that we have on the table. Specifically, the X-Box wireless headset and the, what is this, the razor? - [Host] Razor, Kaira, Keira, razor. - [Ken] Kaira? - I'm going to tell you right now you gotta fix your naming structure because we got the (indistinct high pitched tone) (both laughing) It's all over the place. - [Austin] You're making names up now. - No I'm not! - Okay, so the X-Box gaming headset, $99 and the Kaira is $150, so huge steps - Specifically. These are the pros, there is a hundred dollar model of these, but doesn't have the same features of these, which is why we're looking at the pros. - [Ken] Yes. - So the thing with these headsets is that there is definitely more similarities than there are differences. So the biggest similarity with all three of these like we said, there's, X-Box in mind, they all have the X-Box wireless radio in them, so they can connect directly to your X-Box and they all have Bluetooth as well. Meaning you can get your game audio from your X-Box but then you could also hook up your phone, your computer whatever, and get discord audio in the headphones simultaneously and all three of these do that. And that's the biggest feature. - [Ken] Yeah. - And then it's, it's kind of like minute stuff from there for a hundred bucks, these are really great but they don't have a detachable mic. These guys do have a detachable mic. And then... - This one has some weird bone conductivity one, it's not virtual... - It's not bone conductivity, it's beanforming. Which means it's got the, it's got a mic in there that actually is actively trying to point itself into you into the (indistinct) - They call it a virtual boom arm which I guess in a way kind of makes sense because I think it's supposed to emulate how an actual boom mic supposed to switch sound when it's like in front of your mouth. - In my A.V. installation days, we use a lot of beam forming mics with ceiling installations for trying to get like an auditorium, that way only the speaker at the podium is what gets picked up. I mean, it works great, but again, this is $500! Whereas this does most of what this does for a hundred bucks. - Right. And I think it's kind of tough because there are people that obviously spend boatloads of money on gaming headsets. And I guess if you're on the Xbox side of things having the X-Box radio is cool. What that means specifically for gamers is low latency. So much like how you would pair your X-Box series X controller to the console via that same radio and have that low latency experience. You have that with the headset as well. Okay, so that that's one benefit of this thing, but it's still... - The big feature that this has that these don't is this has fantastic active noise cancellation. - Yes. So, in my own experience, like I don't own many gaming headsets. I tend to actually use normal headphones when I'm gaming cause I don't really care all that much personally but I do have a lot of experience specifically with active noise canceling headphones. So I've used the Sony 1000X Mark 4s. I've used the AirPods Max. I've had various amounts of time with the Bose QC 35 ii. Like I I've tried most of the big players out there and I will say, especially compared to the AirPods Max, which I really do like a lot. Obviously that's a very decisive thing to say. I like how comfortable they are. The ANC is super powerful. Sound quality is not the best for $550 but overall I do like them. They're also obviously if you want to flex on people, that's a huge thing. - Yeah. - These sound really really good. The ANC is not as strong as the AirPods Max, but sound quality is way, way, way up there. - I will say with the ANC on this guy it was strong enough that I didn't realize I had not turned off the audio on the TV. (Ken laughs) - And so I was playing with them with the headphones on completely unaware of that. I took them off and I'm like, Oh wait, the TV's on. The TV wasn't even quiet, it was loud. - No, it's like the ANC works really, really well and what's cool is that it is variable. So you can change the level of how much you want to hear the room ambience versus.. - [Host] There is a a transparency mode. - There is a transparency mode. And the cool thing is that unlike the AirPods Max, or the a 1000X Mark 4s where you can dial in that transparency a little bit. But, you kinda of lose a little bit of the sound quality. The sound is pretty consistent all around no matter what level you're at, which is fantastic. This is the, probably the first pair of ANCs that I've tried, where the transparency and the, like the max active noise canceling actually work all around and doesn't affect the sound, which is great. But none of this really speaks to how they work as a gaming headset. I've only been listening to music and watching movies. - [Host] They do sound really, really, really great as music headphones. - Yeah. - But they sound pretty terrible as gaming headphones. The EQ is really weirdly like the base is scooped out. I barely heard footsteps in like an FPS game. - Yeah. I mean, granted, like I feel like things like gunshots like you'll hear like the highs of it which is great. Like it's going to sound really crisp, but I feel like gamers want to hear, you know, their environment in like almost like a punchy kind of vibe. - [Host] Yeah. That bassy rumble. - Yeah. And that, that's the thing is that these headphones are really meant for multimedia altogether. I mean, I'd say it's more for like 20% gaming and the rest of your multimedia is like what it really services. The Bang and Olufsen tuning works well for everything but gaming. - They all have Windows Sonic support which is their, the surround sound - [Ken] Yeah, the spatial audio, yeah so... - Which the AirPod Max's had with things like what Disney+ had that, right? - Yeah Disney+ and some Netflix, which had it as well. - Which is really great and that's a great feature for gaming but again, $500 compared to a $100 or $150. - Let me, let me, let me just point out the elephant in the room here because I think we've been discussing this just purely as headphones, but you guys are probably really thinking about this and are wondering why we didn't even bring up this point. This cost as much as an X-Box series. (Ken laughing) - Yeah, if you're playing on the Series S these costs more. - It's kind of ludicrous, here's the thing, I think that these headphones for as much as you know, they they bat up the whole, Oh, we worked with Microsoft to make, like, to work on their initiative, to make like more premium products specifically designed for X-Box. Let's be real. These are Bang and Olufsen, Beoplay headphones that probably already existed. And then they just put all of the X-Box stuff around it and called it a day. - You can say yes, you can use these for music headphones and gaming headphones. What you can't really say the same about the X-Box one. - [Ken] Yeah. - Like let's face it, you're going to look weird if you're out in public with a mic on and whatever. However, the razors just pop right off. Suddenly these are pretty decent normal over ear headphones, which, I mean they don't sound nearly as good, but they sound...decent. - They're not, they're not the difference of $350 good, right? - The only point I will personally give these ones, it's just, they look so much better. - So I'm going to lay them down here on D I don't know if we'll get them, but we'll probably have to get it on B roll, but volume controls are a slider, ANC controls to get transparency or to get a chat and game, mix or whatever done with the other slider. If you want to answer a phone call or pause music and play music, it's just tapping the side twice. There's not a lot of room to make accidental, you know, presses or swipes or anything with this, which is really nice. - So that's where I'm actually going to give the I'm going to give the win to the Xbox headset. - Yeah. - Because instead of touch, which like you say there's a bunch of issues, the sides are just dials. - Yeah, which is something that I feel like they brought over from the surface headphones, which is very, very clever. I mean, no surprise. The X-Box material design team and the, you know the R&D that they put into this stuff actually went to work here. - I can't, I can't show you this because it's just a touch thing. But, this dial here is the mix between your game audio and your discord audio. And there's a lovely little notch right there that feels good where it's like 50-50, you can tweak it. I prefer this over the touch controls cause even like.. - [Ken] Oh! Physical controls all the way, all the time - [Host] But, I did still, like, still touch those. - Yeah, I mean when you're, when you're gaming, you don't want to think about, Oh, did I get it just right? Did I get it just right? There's nothing that'll ever beat physical controls. - That's where the Razor falls flat, the controls on here are just bad. - [Ken] Yeah. I mean, it's all physical controls, but in the worst possible way, the most antiquated way, right? - [Host] They're literally identical button layout. - [Ken] Oh my God, you're right! - You can't tell like, unless you have it memorized. I don't, I never knew which one was Bluetooth. Which one was mic? I mean it just.. - I mean, it's not that it's hard to tell which one's left or right. But with gaming headsets, I feel like I always confuse which one's left ear, right ear. I mean, not every not everyone's going to look at the LR all the time, right? - You also can't do that while you're wearing them. - [Ken] Exactly. - So I don't know, like, we're back we're back to though, who should buy a $500 pair of gaming headphones for X-Box? - No one - No one, but like if you have the money to burn, go buy a second X-Box. (Ken laughs) Like, I think that will give you a much better like return on your investment. - Honestly, honestly, go to Best Buy, go to Target, spam the add to cart for PS5, sell your PS5 and then you'll probably buy these with like a $300 discount that you made for yourself. I think that's, that's all that's in the beginner series - And you'll get a series S in the process. - Exactly. - If you need the active noise cancellation, just, I'm saying buy a second console, go set up a shack in the middle of the woods, and there's a complete quiet and that's still cheaper than doing this. - [Austin] Is there a conclusion to be a scalper? - No. - No, my conclusion Mr. Austin Evans is to be a tech reviewer so companies can send this stuff out and we get to try them and ultimately get to keep them for a while. - [Austin] Great consumer advice there. - I would not buy this with my own money but I'm happy that I tried it. - You are happily keep them (host laughs) - I will happily keep them. Look, these are great in a vacuum, if money was no object which there are consumers that are out there that I'm sure this will service. - I'm going to argue that as a whole, this being advertised as a gaming headset and not, not just headphones. I'm going to say in a vacuum, they're still only good, not great because they're just so poor at being a gaming headset, that brings down the greatness. Yes. They, they do sound really really amazing as for music. - Right. - But I don't want to play games, even playing Ori which is just like such a beautiful, like (angelic singing) game, they sounded flat. And that's just, it was disappointing. So let us know in the comments what you think, would you buy a $500 gaming headset? Or, more appropriately would you do with that $500 instead of buying a $500 gaming headset? Like, subscribe, find Austin. - Ring-a-ling that ding-a-ling bell. - Yeah. We'll, we'll give it to you, but we'll catch you in the next one.",

    "transcript": "- [Austin] This episode is sponsored by Storyblocks. With Storyblocks, you have unlimited access to studio-quality stock video. You can check out more in the link below. Hey guys, and welcome to This Is Now! The Switch Lite comes out today. It is expected to be a big, big hit. What about some of Nintendo's not-so-big hits? After selling over 100 million units, I don't think anyone can argue that the Wii was not one of the most popular consoles ever made. Wii U on the other hand, not quite so much. Nintendo only managed to sell around 14 million consoles during the Wii U's five-year lifespan. Within context, that is less than the PS4 sells every year. A big reason for that was the marketing. Customers were confused on exactly what exactly a Wii U even was. Was it a new console? Was it an add-on for the existing Wii? Tons of people really weren't sure. And the implementation of the touchpad didn't help either. For starters, it seemed like a big step back from the full motion controls of the Wii. Dual-screen gaming worked well enough for the DS, but that was when those screens were right next to each other. A lot of people just felt it was a cumbersome thing to try to incorporate, including Nintendo. The only game that really properly took advantage of the game pad was maybe Super Mario Maker, and I guess Mario Party, but-- - [Matt] I kinda liked playing as Bowser on the gamepad for Mario Party, like you could kinda like, you cheated during the game. I thought that was fun. - [Austin] Matt, I'm not surprised that you enjoyed Bowser. That sounds exactly right. On top of all that, the console itself was just plain underpowered. Especially considering that it barely was better than like, an Xbox 360 or PS3, even though it came out right before the PS4 came out. So while there wasn't a whole lot of third party support for the Wii U, it really wasn't even powerful enough to run most of those major games that were on this new generation of consoles, and thus, it failed to catch on with most gamers. Although the good thing is, is that all the best Wii U games are now on the Switch, so, you don't have to go back to play it, you can just play the Switch Lite. The Nintendo DS is another example of a super popular console that was marred by the launch of its successor. But don't get me wrong, after eight years, the 3DS is a very popular console, with a bunch of cool special editions, and a massive catalog of games. However, when it first launched, it was a pretty hard sell. The problem was of true 3D gaming, without the need for any type of glasses was a cool gimmick, but that was just the problem. It was pretty much just a gimmick, and kind of a bad one at that. The 3D imagery was blurry, it made the already low-resolution gaming seem even worse. Personally, I always left it off. In fact, that's one of the reasons why, if I'm ever going to play a 3DS game these days, I use the new 2DS XL, because who needs 3D anyway? I mean, a number of people complained that the 3D was giving them headaches, and just like me, turned off the 3D function altogether. Now, considering that all this happened when the 3DS launched at a whopping $250, especially when you consider it didn't have the 3D, it was just a very expensive DS. Now, the sales in those early days were pretty bad, until they did give it a pretty sizable price cutdown from $250 to, I believe, $170. And then people realized that they couldn't play the latest generation of Pokmon. Although, fun fact, because the 3DS didn't sell well, they continued to make Pokmon games for the DS for several years into the 3DS's lifecycle. Speaking of terrible 3D, how can we talk about weird failed products and not mention the biggest flop of all? The Virtual Boy. It was also marketed as having cutting-edge 3D, virtual reality graphics. While it did have some 3D stereoscopic graphics, it definitely wasn't VR, and it was anything but cutting-edge. In fact, the graphics were closer to those cheap, single-game toys, versus the Virtual Boy's cousin, the Super Nintendo. Most games like Mario Clash even played more like the NES games when you consider that this had pretty much only a single color: red. Yes, my friends, it wasn't like the four colors of the Game Boy, or the 16-bits or the 8-bits, or anything like that of the actual home consoles. This just had red and black. Supposedly, Nintendo looked into adding full color, but that would've brought the already-high price of the console to over $700. So you get red and black in your fake VR headset. - [Matt] It was still really expensive at like 180 bucks. - [Austin] On top of all of that, the Virtual Boy made people sick. Now, VR today, even with its high resolution and high frame rates, can still make people nauseous, but the Virtual Boy caused blurred vision, headaches, and nausea to the point where several games even came with an option to automatically pause every 15 minutes to prevent, ahem, strain. Now, unsurprisingly, a console with subpar graphics and outdated games didn't really sell all that well especially considering that it would make you sick. In total, the Virtual Boy only sold around 770,000 units, and I'm pretty sure all of those units are now being used as set dressing for hip YouTubers. - [Matt] Heh, where do you think I got that one? - [Austin] Now, Nintendo has had some super crazy peripherals throughout the years, and I'm not even talking about the obvious ones, like the N64, GameCube controllers. Handhelds have always been very popular for Nintendo, so it is no surprise they've tried to capitalize even more on those platforms. And while loot boxes in gaming have been a buzz-worthy topic that we've done an entire episode on, it turns out that companies like EA and 2K are way late to the party. Some games might have loot boxes, but back in 2001, Nintendo had the e-Reader. - [Commercial Voice] New e-Reader for Game Boy Advance. Slide the cards to play some of your favorite games. - [Austin] The e-Reader plugged into the cartridge slot of the Game Boy Advance. Now, players could buy booster packs, which contain five e-cards, which then could be scanned to unlock secret levels, power-ups, like special trader battles in Pokmon Ruby and Sapphire, and items for your town in Animal Crossing. And of course, Pokmon trading cards were absolutely booming in 2001, so it seemed natural to start integrating those cards with the e-Reader. For a very short time, Nintendo and Wizards of the Coast, who developed the Pokmon trading card game, integrated e-Reader support on the Pokmon cards, which was kind of cool. I definitely had a lot of those Pokmon cards. But the thing was, even though that was cool, they didn't actually do that much. Like usually, when you swiped them, it would just give you, like a little Pokdex entry or something. - [Matt] Yeah, yeah, pretty much. - [Austin] The cards themselves use a special type of barcode called a DotCode, which actually contained all of the data for the content as opposed to unlocking something already programmed to the game. Now, ultimately, the e-Reader didn't catch on because of how slow and inconsistent scanning cards actually was. I mean, each card had to be scanned twice, once on both sides, and very slowly. Like, I mean, it was properly slow. Now, it was very cool tech, but the e-Reader was also prone to unexpected errors, which just frustrated users, and Nintendo scrapped it only a few years later. At which point I bought it, as well as a bunch of cards for super cheap. Before the NES blew up, it came with a unique little robotic operating buddy, also known as R.O.B., or that one character that you played in Smash that you don't actually remember where it came from. Now, after the great Atari crash of 1983, the U.S. market was not interested in video games. So, in order to sell units, Nintendo marketed the NES as a \"entertainment system,\" A.K.A. toy, as opposed to a video game. R.O.B. connected to the system, and allowed players to interact with him, but it actually only worked for two games: Gyromite and Stack-Up. Once the NES started gaining popularity as an actual video game console, R.O.B. was discontinued, and of course, most people just know him as the weird robot who was really annoying in Smash Brothers. Now, the Power Glove was another ill-fated NES accessory. While it looked super cool in Fred Savage's \"The Wizard,\" the Power Glove was an infamously bad piece of hardware. Nintendo's touted that after you place the bulky sensors on your TV, and manually program the game code into the glove every time, you would have the ability to use motion gestures. Except, none of that worked, like, at all. Nintendo was criticized for sticking with game cartridges for the N64 because of their limited ROM. Now, they had partnered with Sony to create the CD-based Nintendo PlayStation, something I feel like my mom would've said when I was a kid, which you can actually check out an entire video on here. But ultimately, the two companies had a falling-out, resulting in the Sony PlayStation that we all know and love. When the Nintendo 64 cartridges were maxed out by developers, Nintendo released the 64DD attachment, which allowed people to use CDs on the N64. Awesome! Great, right? Well, no. So the DD was actually originally a developer tool they sort of rushed out, and unfortunately Nintendo opted to use magnetic CDs instead of optical, which didn't really hold that much more storage than the cartridges, so it kind of defeated the purpose. In their first attempt at multi-screen gaming, Nintendo released the Game Boy Advance GameCube link cable, which, on paper would use you Game Boy as a controller with a second screen, with helpful information such as maps. Very similar to the Wii U. However, like with all of these products, there was very little support for it. Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles was hyped up as the return of the Final Fantasy franchise to Nintendo. Players were required to have a Game Boy and link cable for each player, which was an expensive buzzkill. Although, I did used to play with, you could trade from the Pokmon Colosseum to Ruby and Sapphire using that cable, which was very cool. - [Matt] That's pretty much all anyone actually ended up using it for. - [Austin] Yeah. Lastly, Nintendo has had some weird partnerships outside of the gaming world, like the Game Boy Pocket Sonar, which was a legitimate fish-finding attachment for the original Game Boy. Like for actual, like, fishing. - [Matt] Yeah. - [Austin] Additionally, there have been multiple attempts to integrate the world of textiles into the Nintendo ecosystem. With the Nintendo knitting machine for NES, and the Singer-Izek attachment for the Game Boy. I can't even believe I'm saying this right now. But both let you design, and I guess, knit patterns, right on your Nintendo console. Speaking of knitting and Nintendo consoles, our sponsor for today's video: Storyblocks!

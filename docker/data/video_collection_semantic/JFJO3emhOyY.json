    "description": "Meet the grandfather of the compact fluorescent light.  This device from GE is really interesting and ahead of its time, but far too weird to gain widespread acceptance.  GE manufactured these adapters to shoehorn the standard circline tube into more everyday applications, and the result is kinda weird.  This video's a quick exploration of this early attempt to bring the energy saving virtues of fluorescent lighting into the domestic arena.  You can support this channel on Patreon!

    "transcript": "This video will be a little different. This is a wonderfully earnest device made by General Electric, and I use the word earnest because its clearly a neat idea, but a far from perfect, and to be honest, weird idea. This is the GE Circlite energy saving lamp from 1991. Many of this products details seem lost to history, probably because these werent so popular. I mean, this box shows you right here. Started at 10.96, went on clearance for $7, annnnd ended up at Goodwill for $1.99 many years later. Quick note--yes this isnt what I said my next video was going to be, Im working on it--I promise!--but I wanted to show you this thing. I had originally planned to showcase this in my last video and had it in the first draft of the script, but it got lost in the basement of my parents house, and only recently could I visit them and find it. So, what is this? Well, its a not-so-compact fluorescent lamp, or an NSCFL if you will. It looks as though GE may have been making these since the sixties in various forms. Really this is a magnetic ballast and starter plug concealed in this, and I hesitate to call it such but, attractive adapter. You can tell its a plain-ol magnetic ballast because its 1) Old, and 2) surprisingly heavy. It drives a 22 watt T9 circline tube, and its meant as an energy saving alternative to incandescent lamps. Really forward thinking, and the box has some compelling data on the back. This unit appears to have never been put to use, as the lamp ends arent darkened at all, and its in the original carton. So, how does one use this thing? Well, a large part Im sure of why these never took off was the fact that installing them in a lamp could be fairly annoying. Youd need to remove the shade and harp, install the assembled lamp, though the instructions say you should put the tube in after youve screwed the adapter in, which is nothing short of asinine, and then the harp would go through the space between the tube and ballast, and youd put the shade back on. Cool. But it wont work in a lamp like this, a ceiling fixture like that, or really in a whole bunch of applications. Not exactly universal. Assembling it is somewhat terrifying because this clip is is rather tight, and I know fluorescent tubes are stronger than they look, but it still seems like its gonna shatter in my hands when clipping it in. Then you put the little plug in and youre ready to run it. Because it uses a preheat starter, it starts erratically and differently each time you turn it on! So thats fun. And after it fires up, youll see the second reason these probably werent that popular. The phosphor formulation in this tube is AWFUL. Really, really bad. White balance is, weird, with it producing a sickly purplish grey light--even though the box assures us it has a warm, pleasing color. Nope! And white balance isnt the biggest issue. ANYTHING under it looks bizarre, with colors being reproduced very strangely. But, this was pretty much standard fare for fluorescent lighting of the time. Lets do a quick comparison. I tend to buy all of my household items from IKEA because Im cheap and boring, so I happen to have three identical lamps. Lets load em up with a standard 75 watt incandescent (what this promises to replace), the ENERGY CHOICE miracle device in the middle, and a more modern 60 watt equivalent CFL. Ready, go! What a warm, pleasing color that middle one makes. Well, lets give it a better chance, then. One of the real advantages this has over a modern CFL is that the ballast is separate from the tube, so we can replace the tube with something a little less terrible. Off to the hardware store. Here in the US, we describe our fluorescent tubes by their diameter in eighths of an inch. Not sure how the rest of the world does it, but true to American fashion, its a rather bizarre numbering scheme. The older T12 tube is 1 and a half inches in diameter, as its 12/8ths of an inch, and the now more standard T8 is one inch in diameter. But this thing is a T9. Nine eighths of an inch. Not sure why thats a thing, but apparently its a standard size for circline tubes. Whatever. Im truly sorry if this is standard convention for the rest of the world because its ridiculous. So, now that Ive got a not-terrible tube installed, how does it look? MUCH better. Its a little cooler than Id like at 3000K, but at least colors look at least somewhat correct. I think Ill leave this thing in one of my lamps here, as it is plenty bright and a neat novelty every time you switch it on. One thing I cant help but wonder is what will happen when the starter fails. It doesnt seem like youre meant to replace it, and truthfully I dont know if this center bit even comes apart, but I imagine it will last for a very long time. In fact the box suggests the adapter should last 20 years. If for some reason it wont start a tube anymore, Ill hack this open and see if its rocking a standard glow starter plug thing or what. Though you can see the starter glow at the bottom of the adapter, so we know for sure it at least has the guts of a standard neon starter plug inside. One interesting note is that because the tube is far away from the center of the adapter, in lamps that will accommodate it, it produces far more light downward than even an ordinary incandescent. This can be useful for lamps such as desk lamps, as it will illuminate the work surface quite well. Thanks for watching, and thank you especially to supporters on Patreon! You can support this channel with a totally voluntary contribution to help keep these videos coming. And with that, Ill see you next time.",

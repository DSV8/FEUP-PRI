    "transcript": "- Whoo! Sports Ball! Man! He homered that touchdown right between the pipes! It's time to celebrate with some tunes and some gamin'. Combining two things you love should be a winning strategy. And thanks to a recent comment, our eyes have been opened to the combination of tech and supporting our favorite sports teams. Just look at all the branded headphones, Bluetooth speakers, wireless chargers, mice and keyboards that you can buy. Can buy. But should you buy them? The short answer is no. The long answer is no. And a fascinating rabbit hole of outrageous markups, skeezy sales tactics, and outright false advertising. And the deeper we went, the clearer it became that someone needed to blow the whistle. (whistle ringing) Just like I'm gonna blow the whistle on our sponsor. - The Ridge. Get rid of your old bulky wallet. The Ridge wallet will keep your pockets light and organized. Click the link below and use code \"Linus\" to save 10% off your purchase and get free shipping. - I guess we'll kick things off with the Kansas City Chief's logo wireless Bluetooth gaming headphones and stand. (Linus chuckles) I hadn't actually seen the stand before we started the shoot. This is truly unexceptional. As for the headphones themselves, they're not the worst that I've seen. Oh. They do the same thing as the Tommy Hilfiger ones where you push on them and you can actually hear the drivers buckle. We kicked these over to the lab to test, though, and shockingly, the frequency response curve is not that far off our target. I gotta hear this. It's kind of mind blowing how good these look on paper. Yeah, they're a little bass heavy, but it's down in the subbase where it should add to the rumble of a bass guitar or a kick drum without making the overall sound boomy or muddy. I wouldn't describe them as having sparkly accurate highs, but they're serviceable. There's some weird electrical sounds when skipping forward and backward though. Even the boom mic is good. Though, that's not to say that it's without bugs. PC gamers will need to plug in this wimpy five foot extension cable in order to use the boom mic because it doesn't get detected. It seems to be a design limitation though, rather than a defect since the PS5 picks it up no problem. Console gamers will probably be pretty happy then, 'cause even if you have an Xbox or a PS4, they include this separate little mini mic to plug into your controller. How about pricing then? Let's check out the product page. We'll just head over to nflshop.com, easy enough to remember, given they never shut up about it. I wouldn't know anything about that. If LTT Store- LTT Store- LTT Store- Hey, lttstore.com. Eight bucks for personalization. That's pretty reasonable. Though I don't know if I could say the same about the price in general. $100 is a lot for these, everything considered. I mean, fair enough, it does have bold printed graphics so you can listen to the game day broadcast. But there's some other pretty questionable stuff here. 100% plastic. That would be impressive if true. And if these are made in the USA, I will eat them. There's supposed to be a label or a sticker. Yeah, that's America right there. That could be a legitimate problem for the NFL if anyone ever catches them. And there's some other weird stuff here too. Some of the product labels make sense. \"Officially Licensed Gear\", customized item, special event item. Pretty self-explanatory. But others are kind of nebulous. What's a \"manufacturer direct item\"? And why doesn't the NFL run its own web store? We're gonna get to that one in a bit. First, we noticed that while the KC Chief's logo appears to be simply printed onto blank ear covers, just because one team has a certain item available doesn't necessarily mean that your team will too. In spite of how easily it apparently could. Though, maybe that's not always a bad thing. Let's see what's up with these peripherals. Ooh! Toronto Raptors repping Canada! And the Bengals. This is an interesting combination. (Harrison groaning) (Linus laughs) What? What? That doesn't sound quality to you? It's the vinyl wrap that seems to be over top of what would be a mouse pad with a Qi charging spot on it. I gotta say, with this textured, partly glossy, partly matte wrap on it though, it would be a miracle if even a good mouse tracked on it, nevermind this one. Where are my dongles at? Oh, there it is. Ah, okay. Black dongle for the keyboard. Oh yeah! And a white dongle for the mouse. That's actually kind of nice. (keyboard clacking) Did Labs test this? - [Harrison] Yes. - Shut up! Even though it's 2.4 gigahertz, given its performance, this thing might as well be Bluetooth. 37 milliseconds of average latency! 50 milliseconds max! I thought this might just be Windows being unresponsive, but this feels like a delay, even opening the freaking start menu. How about the mouse? Oh! The mouse is no better. 30 milliseconds average, 45 max. The mouse apparently has no rated DPI, but what we do know is that it's less than 1,200 because we would've needed that for Mouse Tester 1.4, by the way, shout out r/MouseReview. Does the charging at least work? - [Harrison] Oh! - All right, all right. I guess this is less about performance and more about repping the brand, though. Should we at least look at the print quality? Seems like it's actually pretty good. Bold, vibrant colors. Hold on a second. Hold on a second. What do these keys do? This is an F5. This is just F5? This just refreshes the webpage? That button's right here. Okay, what's up and down? Back and forward in the browser? I mean, I guess if your crappy mouse doesn't have back and forward buttons on it. All right, do maternal time. This mouse is so squishy. That's the best way that I can describe it. You know, if you wanna game badly enough and you're at your sport fan uncle's house, you'd find a way to make this work. You'd be compensating for a lot of slop, though. Both the accuracy and precision were, again, worse than the Tommy Hilfiger set, and that's not even when we're pushing it to the limit. If you try to do a 360 no scope, just whipping this around on the pad, it completely loses its ability to track. Completely. I am not even moving it that fast right now. Oh wow. That's bad. There's one more thing I'm curious about. Before it became a Bengals mouse pad, what was this? Okay. No, see, it felt like it was just a vinyl wrap over an otherwise something product. But actually it's just a vinyl wrap over a piece of cardboard. There. Okay. Yeah, there's a Qi coil and a small circuit board. Total bomb cost for this I'm guessing about $2.50. How much did we pay for it? $60? Oh, now I feel bad about destroying it. Anyhoo. So these are garbage and you should only buy them if you wanna punish your former BFF who you had a falling out with for supporting rival sports ball team club. But there's a much more interesting takeaway here. In spite of the spotty availability of NFL branded merch from team to team, we are now running into duplicate items across entirely different sports leagues. So who exactly is Fanatics, the group that evidently is running the NFL shop? The site looks basically the same as the NFL one, except that you can buy anything here. According to this article from boardroom.tv, they got into the sports gear game back in 1998 and have grown to the point where they claim to be worth more than all 32 NHL teams combined. Not only do these guys have deals with the four big sports leagues, but they also deal in branded apparel for college sports, motor sports, golf, wrestling, the Olympics, and even eSports. To top it off, pun intended, last year they closed a deal to practically take over the sports trading card scene too. Now that we know where everything's coming from, let's check out a couple more products. As someone who's seen a lot of cheap knockoff earphones, let me tell you, if we hadn't bought these from an officially licensed store, I would be pretty sure these are them. Look at the size of this receiver piece. Micro USB charging. What year is it? Wow. Everything from the packaging to the looks to the comfort. Peak wish.com tier. (Linus laughs) Can't believe I bought all this stuff. Oh, that's a cute idea. It's a Bluetooth speaker in the shape of a puck. It has a microSD slot. Okay. - [Bluetooth Speaker] Testing. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3. Testing, testing. 1, 2, 3. Testing- - [Linus] How do I skip the track? - [Bluetooth Speaker] 1, 2, 3. - [David] Why would you wanna skip that? It's a banger. - [Bluetooth Speaker] Testing, testing. 1, 2, 3. - Well, we'll give it a little while. It should theoretically survive half an hour with an IP 67 rating. - [Harrison] And it did in testing. - Oh, it actually survived half an hour once already. Impressive. It's hard to tell with the song that I'm listening to. I'm not super familiar with it, but seems to sound kind of all right. Waterproofness aside then, this stuff sucks too. So what's the deal here? While we don't know much about Fanatics' corporate structure or their other dealings, there are a lot of red flags here. You need to click this tiny link to explicitly opt out of them selling your personal information. Their customer testimonials are few and read as though their VP of marketing wrote them. And they use cringe, high pressure sales tactics to drive you to purchase. \"Oh no, this 65% off banner will shortly disappear forever in just a few short hours. Whatsoever shall I do?\" I'd say don't worry about it, because A, it'll be back, and B, it doesn't apply to winning teams or athletes, player grade jerseys and headwear, any brands that you would actually wanna buy from or, at Fanatics' own discretion, any other brand or product. So basically, it's an artificial discount on crappy stuff that they just applied astronomical markups to ahead of time, or, I guess, their own branded products, which is not fundamentally a problem as long as the quality is goo- Oh. Their satisfaction guarantee says all the right reassuring things, but nobody picked up when we called during business hours on a Friday, and the community response to their upcoming NHL uniform partnership deal has been unenthusiastic, to say the least. So it would appear that our experience wasn't unique. But whatever the quality of Fanatics' products might be, the ones we've actually been looking at today seem to come from someone else. Keyscaper. You know someone actually asked me why we don't do Bluetooth headphones on lttstore.com. This is why. There are enough Bluetooth headphones in the world. Oh my God, there's another microSD slot. Also, these are for kids. Oh no. I'm about to find out how much we paid for these. $80? It doesn't say these are for kids. Some jerkwad product manager just didn't care enough to notice... That these are way too small. I wear a small size motorcycle helmet, okay? If it's small on me, it's flipping tiny. What I'm more interested in is this, more advanced technology, better and stronger materials, more reasonable design. I mean, look. I mean, yeah- Whoa. Oh, they cracked. I wouldn't recommend that. This is the cheapest, genericest crap. Whoa! They are light. What? The left one doesn't even work? They even sound cheap when you drop them on the table. And I can barely get it open. I give up. I can't get these paired, but the reality of it is, I'm not missing out on much. And if I was really upset about it, I could get the same experience for less. Keyscaper-slash-strategic manufacturing is plastered all over the manuals and the webpages for these products, but thanks to the power of the internet, we were able to find some, not all, but some of your favorite sports ball tech products for sale on sites like Alibaba, AliExpress, and even Amazon at much lower prices. The headset that we looked at at the beginning, $130 with a sports team logo, $14.86 without one. These earbuds, 30 bucks with a logo, $2 without. As for our bendy childrens headphones, $20 on amazon.com. If you remember, these were 80 from the official store. Now, branding OEM products like these is nothing new. Corsair's first power supply, for example, was basically a rebadged Seasonic unit. And, believe it or not, I do not have a water bottle factory in my basement. But it takes a certain level of just plain not giving a crap to put your brand on such garbage. I mean, if we were talking hotel freebies, sure, but huge sports teams valued at billions of dollars? It feels downright disrespectful to their fans, especially given the prices. I mean, I don't know, maybe some of it's okay. We got more? - [Harrison] Oh yeah. - Oh God. What year is it? There's an oxen on it. - [Bluetooth Speaker] It's game on. (upbeat music) - It's a lot better than I expected. I could get it onto that. Where else would you have a lava lamp? So here's the thing, it's not my place to tell you what is or isn't okay to spend your money on. If you wanna rep your favorite teams, by all means, but at least consider an alternative way of going about it. For the same price as this Toronto Raptors mouse and keyboard, why not a Logitech G305 and a Keychron mechanical keyboard? Or, as an alternative to the KC Chief's headset, how about these Arctis Nova 3s from Steel Series? They're better in every possible way, and you can even still demonstrate fealty to your favorite billionaire team owner while you game, because you'll have plenty of budget left over for enough stickers to deck out your entire setup. We're gonna have this stuff and some similar suggestions linked down below. But we do have a couple more things to check out, apparently. Oh goodness. Yep. It's the genericest car phone holder ever. Now with 100% more of the logo of that craptastic team that takes up space in our downtown core. Sorry, do I sound like an embittered former fan? Wasn't my intention to sound like one. Or to become one. Okay. Yeah. That'll actually hold pretty okay. Oh! Sorry. Charlotte Hornet's battery bank. Yep, that's a micro USB battery bank. Seriously? Shut up. They didn't even bother to properly license MagSafe? Oh, wow. If you wanna look like you bought your tampon-sized air pods on AlliExpress, even the pairing message sounds horrible. Unlistenable. How much are these? $45? One and a half hours of playtime? \"Secure comfort fit.\" Well... Oh, actually they stay in okay. Why does all this stuff say 100% plastic? That is not how that works. And they all use the exact same copy-pasted description. So little effort. Man, this whole experience was kind of soul draining. I fully understand that companies need to make money. You could certainly get a cheaper windbreaker than ours at costco.com. The difference, is that we go out of our way to make sure that the quality matches the higher sticker price. And I just can't say the same about any of my experiences shopping with Fanatics and with Keyscaper. Unscrupulous companies like these hurt fans wallets and they hurt the image of the teams and the leagues. The NFL makes a really big deal out of protecting the shield. And honestly speaking from my point of view, this is exactly the kind of manufactured garbage that they should be actively distancing themselves from rather than signing long-term partnerships with. But hey, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Maybe it's not about protecting their image or their fans. Maybe it's about protecting their bottom line. Speaking of bottom lines, this is the bottom line of the script. Meaning it's time to segue to our sponsor. Micro Center. Fact, Micro Center has 25 stores. Second fact, it's about to be 28. They've got the Indianapolis flagship store opening this summer and two more stores opening by 2025. Final fact, it's Apple month all month long at Micro Center with some crazy good deals on all your favorite Apple products that you won't see anywhere else. And no, we're not talking Granny Smiths, we're talking deals like the MacBook Pro 16 inch being $150 off MSRP all throughout April. Not into Macs? Well, let their in-house PC building team put together a new custom rig for you that as unique as you are. And if technical difficulties come up, they've got your back with their certified technicians at the knowledge bar. But wait, there's more. As a special treat, Micro Center is offering a fantastic deal to all new customers. Shop at one of their locations and you can get $25 off your purchase of $100 or more in store. How about them apples? So what are you waiting for? Head on over to the links in the description to check out Micro Center today. If you guys enjoyed this video, big ups to all of you who stayed around for the credits. You may also enjoy the time we checked out Tommy Hilfiger's gaming peripherals. We didn't have anything particularly nice to say, but it's a wild ride.",

    "transcript": "- It just feels so black. Here's the plan of attack. I'm gonna try inserting this board, and see if I can get this thing working, today. Oh, (beep) it just totally snapped apart. (electronic beeping) (upbeat electronic music) Hey, guys, how are you all doing? Really, that's just great. You know what, I'm doing really great today, too. In fact, I'm doing better than great, because I've wanted this computer, in my collection, for many years. And, now, it is a reality. And, today, I'm here to share it with you. Yes, this is the Macintosh TV, an Apple computer-TV hybrid, that sold for, I think, four months. About 10,000 units were made, and that was it. That officially puts this computer on the list of the more rare Macintosh computers out there. Not only was it not sold for very long, not only were very few units made, but it was the first Macintosh with TV capabilities built in, and it was the first black Macintosh, as well. So, definitely a special machine, rare, fun. I love the design of it. It just feels so black, yes. Think of the iMac Pro. This was kind of like the grandfather to the iMac Pro. This was space gray before space gray even existed, with matching keyboard and mouse. And, I love the old click sound of that Desktop Bus Mouse II. So, we're gonna have some fun with this, today, and explore what's on the hard drive, explore the features, because I have never turned it on. There is one little caveat, though. This is the board. Well, Krazy Ken, how are you gonna use the computer, if the board's not in it? That's a good question, anonymous tech viewer. I'm not. When I picked up this computer, apparently, right before I picked it up, this board stopped working. So, I got this computer from a little tech shop in a Chicago suburb. In fact, it's a Mac training and repair facility, called Macnician. And, the gentleman I spoke with, mentioned that the board broke, right before I was gonna come pick it up. However, what he did, was he put a Mystic board inside of it. He took an upgraded Macintosh Color Classic board, AKA, a Mystic board, out of a Color Classic computer, and threw it into this Macintosh TV. So, right now, it's a Macintosh TV shell, with a Mystic board on the inside. So, it's kind of a very unique hybrid. However, he still gave me the original board, with the tuner on it, in case I can get it working. And, oh shit, I think I just bent that, the back panel, in case I can get the board back inside of it, so I can put that on there, too. He gave me that, plus the original hard drive. Apparently, it's a LCSI Quantum ProDrive LPS. The original hard drive from the Mac TV, almost forgot that. (laughs) So glad we got that. So, if I ever get that board working, I can put this hard drive back in the computer, and have all the Macintosh TV system software and functionality. And, in case that wasn't enough, he also gave me the Macintosh TV CD, so I can reinstall stuff, if I have to, with a free caddy. So, like, oh my gosh, super-generous. He gave me so many goodies, that's awesome. So, here's the plan of attack. We're gonna take a look at the hardware, explore the hard drive, look at the software, then, I'm gonna try inserting this board, and see if I can get this thing working today. Maybe the Krazy Ken curse will reverse its power, and actually fix something for once. So, come on (tap), let's get started. So, here's the Mystic board, with an ethernet card on it, too. And, because we have a different board in there, that's why this doesn't line up anymore. Hence, why the panel has been taken off, temporarily. Interestingly enough, it looks like this was serviced at one time. There's an AppleCare sticker on here, with handwriting. That's kind of cool, like a little treasure right there. So, we have that, we can easily slide this out, if we need to. We have the hard drive there, again. I can maybe pop this original one back in there, later. I'll try that after I test out all the features, and explore the hard drive that's currently in here. We'll try the other board. Anyone who knows me, knows I have this extreme obsession with dark things. So, I've just gotta say, I already liked the curviness of the Espresso design language, which I actually do talk about on vintage Apple Vault, with, coincidentally, the Color Classic, but adding black on top of that, like, wow. They're combining two things I really like. I can just pet this thing. It's (laughs), oh, I probably should dust it a little bit. I cleaned it a little. I also love how the receiver, the infrared receiver, is on top. That's typically where we'd have the microphone, but I believe that's the infrared receiver for the remote, which, I actually didn't get one of the remotes. I guess I'll just have to get one of those on eBay, later. Yep. So we have that up there, and the microphone Is down there, right next to the Apple logo. And, I also noticed the caddy (laughs) is white, or, I guess, platinum was the color. I don't know why they had a black case, but they left the CD-ROM caddy platinum. It kind of sticks out, but, to be honest, I don't care. It's vintage. In regards to the board, here's the tuner. I (laughs), don't have analog cable, so I don't know if I'll be able to use this, even if I get the board working. However, I can maybe pick up a set of rabbit ears, to try to test the TV functionality on this computer. If we get the board working, and I have no way to actually use the tuner, the next-best bet would be to use the composite video. I can just hook up a VHS player, or, maybe, even an old joystick game console thing, just to play games on here. We can hook up stuff through that. And then, it's kind of dusty, ooh, we've got SCSI there, serial, and ADV. And, just as a quick shout out to Apple's old design, these tracks just slide in and out. When you wanna take a hard drive out, put one in, you just slide it on the tracks, and it just kind of locks in, with this little tab here. Simple, right? Good times. We're about to boot up here, but I must say, one thing I really love about these old Macs, are the Trinitron displays. They are just so frickin' crystal clear, and this one has a 14 inch Trinitron. First boot. Step one. Turn on the PSU. (computer hums) Dah, shit! Okay, what the (beep). Okay, hopefully, it doesn't kill me. Step two, start up. The button is on the keyboard. (computer chimes) ooh Hard drive going. Chime is going. I normally don't run these computers with the back plates off, but, I kind of need to, at least for now. (computer chimes) Oh, it booted up twice. Alright, looks like we have, hey, Mac OS there we go. And, here we are. And, the hard drive is labeled Mystic, probably from the Mystic board. Isn't that color classic? Sweet. Okay, so it is a little bit louder, because the back panel is off, and the hard drive is right near the back. So, we'll just deal with that, for now. But, yeah, wow, this is, oh my gosh, dude. These old displays are just so crisp. Holy cow. So, I believe we're running some version of seven five. Oh, we're on seven six one. Okay. Yeah, it says, \"About this computer.\" Doesn't say, \"About this Macintosh.\" I don't know if system seven six, or Mac OS seven six, just normally says, \"About this computer\", or, maybe it's because there's different hardware in here? It doesn't read it as a Macintosh, so instead it just says, \"computer\". I know this was around the cloning era. (laughs) For some reason, I'm holding down the mouse button, but it seems to close sometimes. I dunno, maybe I'm bad at pressing buttons. Let's see, button finder, do we have our... yep, we have our little mountain screens. So, Mac was found here. Cool, seven six. I don't think I've ever used seven six, at least in my recent memory. Pretty sweet. About the grouch, oh! So that's a thing. Let's clean up the desktop. There we go. It looks like we have Number Munchers on the desktop. If that's what I think it is, this was the first game I ever played in school. (laughs) I remember we had a computer lab full of these Windows 95 PC's or whatever. That was the game we played, sweet. So, I'll have to look at that. Let's see. 2.0 system disk image, Apple extras, applications, ICAD, America Online Version 3. We do have an ethernet card on this thing. Yeah, may have to get back to that, later. See if I can get this thing online. Our system folder, trash, Picture One, Oh, a screen shot, look at that. You know, since we have a floppy drive, and a CD-ROM drive built in, I mean, we can import some of our own photos, too, actually. Let me see. This was the disk I used in the Apple CD 300 test episode. I highly recommend you check that out, too, even though it is labeled Premiere 1.0, it is kind of misleading. I, actually, didn't put Adobe Premier 1.0 on there. I only put the assets on there that I wanted to edit with, in Adobe Premier 1.0. The actual program is elsewhere. It'd be cool to edit video on this thing. I might do that, later, too. I also do want to test the speakers on this thing, too, to see if they're good. Man, there's so many things I wanna test. Oh, we're just getting started. I'm so glad to have you here with me, 'cause this is gonna be fun, and I gotta share it. Alright? Hopefully, the desktop file rebuilds soon, and, this worked on my IIci. Is it not working on the Macintosh TV? Hmm, I'm holding down the button, but it doesn't always stay open. I wonder if there's a little bit of a loose connection, in this mouse, or something. Well, that's interesting. I know the CD drive works. It was demoed at the store I picked this up from, so I know it works. I just wonder if this particular CD doesn't like this computer. Extension manager, which I believe this is the new version, that was released with Mac OS seven six. Oh yeah, this is the new design. Let's check it out here. Apple CD-ROM, it is on, version five three three. \"An error occurred while rebuilding the desktop file. \"Comments from info windows are not preserved.\" Okay, I see the 6100 things show up here, that's the name of the CD. So, hopefully, it works now. There it is! Something just opened, what was that? I saw something launch itself. Anyway, the 6100. Here's the CD. Here's my folder, and yeah, we have some files. We might as well just transfer them. Let's see what's on the disk here, games, documents. I'll just put them in the documents folder, right? Sounds fair. I've got some pictures. I've got some movie files. I think I've even have an Adobe Premier 1.0 document in here. I think that's what this is, but I don't have the program yet. But, that will be coming. For now, I'm gonna see if I can just transfer all this stuff off the CD. There you go, looks like it's working. And, this was back in the day where, if you were copying something, that was it. This was a modal copy window. (computer beeps) Not much multitasking. I know you're kind of seeing some moire pattern. I tried fixing that. I'm sorry, it's just how it is with some of these displays. I'm sorry. So, let's just test the performance, I guess, just doing some simple things. I have some photos. Alright, let's test our performance. Let's see how simple text opens a picture. Good start. There you go, look at that dithering. 256 colors, yeah, boy. Yeah, look at Chicago. Let's also change the desktop pattern. Actually, while I'm at it, I'm just gonna change the desktop pattern. There's one of my favorite ones, right there. Yeah. Is the movie player on here? And, the keyboard's way over here. I can't reach it. This keyboard feels really nice to type on, by the way. Oh my gosh, I like these old keyboards. Alright, we do have the movie player. Let's see, where was it hiding? Apple Extras movie player. Apple Extras, I don't know why it's called an extra? Oh, please personalize your copy of movie player. Sure, just call it Mystic. I'm fine with that. Let's go to file open. Let's see. Untitled movie, boom. This is my little test file that I made in Adobe Premier 1.0, on an iBook G3. There I am. Look at that beautiful postage stamp movie. Oh my gosh. Actually, it plays back, pretty well. That leggy cross dissolve, that was baked in. That's not a performance issue, but look it, it's pretty smooth. That, don't look at that. Look at the movement here. That. That's pretty smooth. This thing handles video pretty well. (laughs) I think editing on here is going to be a lot of fun. Oh my gosh, I'm way too excited. Version 2.5, sweet! Oh, full screen, okay, play. Oh, yeah. Now, it's lagging a little bit. (laughs) That's pretty cool, though. That was pretty wicked, sweet. Apple CD audio player. I should put some of my music on a CD, some music that I've written myself, and test out these speakers. I might get back to that in one second. I saw there were some games on here. Let's actually explore that. That sounds fun. Oh, there's a lot of games on here. Holy cow, Monopoly, Mario Teaches Typing, HellCats, Crystal Quest. Oh my gosh, Carmen Sandiego! We've got Carmen Sandiego games on here. Well, it wouldn't be an old Mac without that, I guess. Oregon Trail, oh, dude, I could spend forever in here. This is dangerous. Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego. Well, what do you say? Shall we open it up? Let's do it. Let's see how loud can we crank this bad boy. (laughs) Oh my gosh, yeah. These old point-and-click adventures, man, this was the shit. (computer vocalizes) So nice of you. Well, I want to give some of the other games some love, too. That is pretty cool though. Looks like somebody made some files, and didn't know what to name them. Anyhoozle, let's see what else is on here, game-wise. I wanna see frickin' Mario Teaches Typing. I think that's another game I used to play, wow, oh, way back when. Holy Cow. Did I play that in school or did I play that on my own computer? I don't remember, but I remember playing this game. I vaguely remember a typing game. (computer vocalizes) Oh my gosh. (electronic music) Oh my gosh. Man, I really, I don't have a good angle here. I'm not quite used to this keyboard, the hub keys are not how they are nowadays. Oh, H, I'm totally not used to this. I remember all these sound effects and stuff. Oh my gosh. (electronic music and clicking) Aah, this is really annoying. I mean, so-- (computer vocalizes) \"Congratulations. Lets-a get a pizza.\" I can type about 106 words per minute, but it's so off-putting, as much as I like this keyboard, the hub keys are not F and J. They're D and K, and it totally throws me off. I don't know why it was different back then, but it totally throws me off. That's crazy. Time for Monopoly. Oh, this is really small. Okay, can we make this biggerer? (laughs) Okay, it starts filling in the screen then. \"Take a walk on the Boardwalk.\" Wait, what? Seriously? I'm already on Boardwalk? You kiddin' me? Should I buy it? (laughs) That's a pretty valuable property, for 400, (beep) yeah. I already own Boardwalk. Now, I just need to get Park Place and I'm gonna own this bitch. I've been ignoring it long enough. I think this is the game that I played, way back in elementary school, Number Munchers. I remembered it. \"Licensed to Boobs?\" What? This is probably a much older version. This looks way more primitive, (laughs) than what I remember. Multiples? Oh, fun. Multiples of nine, okay. How do I control this? Do I just click? (computer bleeps) Guess I just click and munch. (computer bleeps) Troggle, okay. Can I use the... okay, I see what it is. Oh, we have another person coming in. Nine, let's get back to it, then. (computer bleeps) Nah, I didn't mean to walk (computer bleeps low tones) I didn't mean to walk into that. Obviously, I don't know how this works. Since I have a huge rack, of CD's, with a convenient carrying handle, I'm going to burn some music that I made, put it in the caddy, and load it up in the Apple CD audio player, and just hear how my music sounds with these built-in speakers. Ooh, space gray. Alright, back in a jif. Man, burning a CD with iTunes. This is probably a feature I've not used in a billion years. The computer's probably goin' like, \"What are you doing? \"What year is this?\" It actually looks, iTunes look pretty cool in dark mode. Hell, yeah. The question is, \"Is is real, or is it Memorex?\" Neither, it's not Memorex. It's DiGiorno. I gotta say, these new CD's, they smell spicy. They smell really spicy. I don't know what it is. (laughs) They kind of smell good. It's probably just the plastic, or something. I don't know why they smell spicy, though. So, it's in the caddy. Let's boot her up. (computer chimes) That is really satisfying, wow. That's just, it's like inserting a CD and a VHS tape, at the same time. By the way, here's the little tower of CDs I have. And, it has a built in handle. That's (laughs) kind of cute. Steve Jobs should be proud, Because, built-in handle, get it? I'm here all week. (computer plays musical notes) Shit, it just started playing, automatically, what? I didn't give you permission to do that. Okay, so I guess it just starts playing CDs, automatically. (laughs) Yeah, okay. That's cool, I was not expecting that. It sounds pretty decent for early 90s built-in speakers. It's pretty good. The Shenanigans theme song. (computer plays music) It's so funny hearing my voice and Kaye's voice, on these old speakers. It's amazing. (computer plays music) And, the cool thing is, there is a headphone jack on here, so we could actually listen to this with better speakers. And, just because I love the satisfying feeling of a CD caddy, I'm gonna-- Shit, it didn't come out too well. Oh, crap. There ya go. Aah, nice. At the beginning of this exploration sensation, I promised we would try to get the other board working. And, I am a man of my word. We're gonna try that now. I've shut 'er down, and, who knows, if the board doesn't work, maybe we just have to do a part two. Even if it does work, there's a lot of other things I'd like to experiment with, so there's probably gonna be a part two, anyway. (hums) Special. Okay, lets' do some swapping. So, I've never particularly removed the board from one of these computers, before, but I'm guessing it's just as easy as sliding it out. That's one of the cool things about this. Maybe not. Let's do the hard drive, first. Okay, I'm a little rusty. I've done stuff like this before, but let me derustify myself, quick. It just needed a little jiggling. There we go. Slowly get it out of there. There we go. And, there is our Mystic board. There's our processor, ethernet card, and more batteries. I'm guessing you needed more power to run this upgraded board. As a reminder, that board works just fine. This board might have issues, but this is the board that originally was in the machine. Let's try puttin' that back in. There you go. This was back when Apple made opening the computers really easy. Let's swap this hard drive out, 'cause this one has the system software on it. There we go. Come up, there we go, there we go. We got it. Congratulations, it's a boy. Alright, the SCSI and, I don't know what connection that is, it's probably for the power, those are like, guess I got to remove this, Oh, (beep), it just totally snapped apart. Now, this is just to allow the drive to communicate and get power, from the computer, when it slides in there. So, that stuff just plugs in, to the disk, and that just slides inside. When I was removing it, it just snapped. (laughs) Oh, (beep) However, we might be okay, 'cause the contacts still look fine. The plastic, that just holds them together, got a little f'ed up. I'm just gonna reinsert them. It looks like it reinserted just fine. It's just cracked right there. Bummer, but it still holds it together. In you go. (click) There we go, okay. The original board is back in. The original hard drive is back in. All that's missing is our rear plate. It looks like there's some screws that should be there. Interesting. My Color Classic just has a removable back, with the tabs. You don't need any screws, but I guess this bigger computer needed screws. Now, the moment we've been waiting for. The board's back in, hard drive's back in, panel's back on. Will it blend? Just kidding, will it boot? Let's find out. Alright, all back together. Get the power supply. (humming click) Bzz. And, (click) what? Wait a minute. What? By the way, this is way quieter than the other one. I dunno if it's just because the hard drive is quieter, but it could also be because we have the rear plate back on. Dude! What, it works! Are these different volumes on the hard drive? This disk must be partitioned. But, yeah, it-- what? (laughing) I'm sorry, I'm in shock. The owner said the board died, or something was wrong with it, and that's why he gave me the Mystic board. I literally just put it back in, and it frickin' works. Shit, this is pretty frickin' cool. See, \"About this Macintosh.\" It did used to say that, I swear. Yeah, we're running, oh, this is seven one. Yeah, Macintosh TV. Eight megs of RAM. Look at that. Wow. (laughs) So, I guess it works. I think this is our start-up disk. System folder's in there, yep. And these are just some empty volumes, on the hard drive. Wow. This is amazing. Let's see. There ya go. Yeah, dude! The TV functionality, there it is. Oh my gosh. This is (beep) amazing. Alright, obviously it's staticky, 'cause I don't have anything hooked up right now. I don't have any bunny ears, or any analog solution, to actually get a TV signal, but I used to have those plug-and-play arcade games, that you can just plug into the composite video, but I don't know if I have those, anymore. I used to have them, but I think I got rid of them. I also have a VHS player, but I loaned it to someone, and I haven't received it back, yet. I'm gonna have to get some of those things, and do a follow-up, and plug some stuff into this thing, and test out the TV functionality more. Oh my gosh! I'm just frickin' excited that it works. I don't know how to change the input. Do I use... oh, nice! So, just right there, we can just plug stuff into the composite video. Then here, we can use the tuner. This is great, dude. I'm calling this a win. Oh, man, I cannot wait to try other things on here, other games, other software, video editing. If you have any software suggestions, please let me know. I'd love to test them out, and I also cannot wait to test out the TV functionality some more. Subscribe, stick around, because I will be revisiting this thing. You bet your sweet bippy. Thanks for comin' along with me, today. This was, truly, frickin' amazing. So excited about this. Thank you, thank you, thank you, everybody, and thank you, Mac Mission, for selling this to me. And thank you, craigslist. I'll see you guys, later. Catch the Krazy, and pass it on. (classic rock music)",

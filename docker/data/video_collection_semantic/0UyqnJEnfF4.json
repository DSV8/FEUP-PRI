    "transcript": "(upbeat music) - Hey guys, it's Justine and we're back with another Mac Pro video, but this one is not going to be anything too crazy in depth. But I just wanted to show you how I have my setup. This is kind of a real world setup I posted on Instagram and Twitter. It was like an Instagram verse reality setup and this was the setup that I showed you guys. Well I have a video coming out in a few days talking more in depth about the Mac Pro, what I've been doing with it for the past couple of weeks. Showing you a few demo projects that I've been testing with it. Just doing a few simple tasks here on the Mac Pro. No big deal. Oh my gosh, they are going crazy. But right now this is just a very simple desk setup video. And the first thing you'll notice is I have this left screen turned vertical. And this has been so awesome to edit because I've been sorting through so much footage, hours and hours of content. So many different multi-cam clips that I'm working with. I haven't edited with dual monitors in a long time so this has been such a treat. I can scroll through. I can do playback of each clip. I love having this vertical monitor because I'm able to zoom in to clips and really get in there. I can really pinpoint pieces that I want out of a clip and not have to worry about throwing it into the timeline and then being precise. I can actually really see it right here. This is also great when I click over here, my different titles and different plug ins and effects, I can see everything. I'm going to be so spoiled from editing on this Mac Pro when I go home for the holidays on my MacBook Pro. Thankfully that 16-inch retina MacBook, I guess maybe I have a little more screen real estate. Maybe not this much. I decided to put the tower on the desk because honestly it doesn't take up as much room as I thought it was going to. And I already have a Jellyfish server on the floor. So I think that it looks really nice up here. I also like having easy access to all the ports so most of the time when I need to plug something. So these top Thunderbolt ports right here, they get used quite often. And then this is the look that we have. It's a look. I think next on my setup, I need to find a really good USB interface so that I'm able to hook up some cool speakers. If I could control the volume, because right now I've been using headphones or I've just been using the speaker that's built in to the Mac Pro. Now quite ideal and here's why. The audio is coming from one side. If you guys have any speaker recommendations or audio interfaces, let me know in the comments below. I have a few that I've been looking at so we'll see if any of your choices match some of mine. This is sort of a temporary setup since I just recently did an office tour video. My actual office is right behind this wall here. So I wanted to set this up here just because it's close to my server and I still have some projects that are rendering out on my iMac. So I didn't want to completely stop using the iMac until I have all those files transferred over and all those projects closed out. So I think this is just the first look at how I have my desk set up for the time being. This is how I've been editing all of my videos. And I really wanted to show you how I'm actually using this. And how much I love this vertical screen. I never thought that this would be the way that I would do this. But the reason that I did decide to flip it is because I was sitting like this. This is how I sit. It's not that great. It's very poor posture. So that's that. Make sure you guys subscribe because I'll be posting a video very shortly here doing some tests with the Mac Pro testing out some 8K footage, also rendering a massive 3-D project that would take some computers several days to do. So I'm excited to see how long it takes this Mac Pro to complete that project. All right that's it. I'm gonna go. And I'll see you guys later, bye. (upbeat music)",

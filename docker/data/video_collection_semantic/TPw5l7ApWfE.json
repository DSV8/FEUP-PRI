    "transcript": "so I'm in the process of rearranging my personal workspace and that includes getting a new tabletop installing new shelving units and so on but most importantly I wanted to upgrade my existing personal workstation PC that's sitting right over here that consists of an 8700 K and an RT X xx atti now don't get me wrong the GPU is great it's the fastest that's available in the market right now but the cpu and the platform deserve an upgrade but I wanted to challenge myself basically I wanted to cram as much as power as I can into a small form-factor chassis without sacrificing on performance thermals and acoustics so why don't we get started right after this the Sound Blaster x3 is the USB DAC I've been waiting for that brings a fantastic audio experience to your desk when the clean mic input and powerful headphone amplifier it connects via type C and brings a new super x5 sound profile that beautifully recreates multi-channel speaker setup for movies at an affordable price alright so this idea was inspired by AMD's recent launch of the Ryzen 9 3950X this cpu exceeded our expectations in terms of its raw CP performance it even puts Intel's highest 10 core i9 1080XC which costs way more than this processor to shame with 16 cores and 32 threads this is the fastest aim for CPU that's available to date provided you can actually find one because literally this thing is out of stock everywhere by the way if you're interested in our full performance review of the 3950X you can check it out right over here now housing the 3950X is the asus rog Strix x570i gaming ITX motherboard that's right guys I'm going ITX this time and this board offers everything I need for a perfect workstation PC in a compact form factor first of all I love the design of this motherboard everything from the matte black PCB to the conveniently placed power connectors should make cable management easier the heatsink placement is well-thought-out as it covers both the VRMs and the chipset plus it's actively cooled by two fans there are 2 m 2 PCI Gen 4 slots one of which is directly placed above the chipset heatsink and another one behind the motherboard it also has Wi-Fi 6 support and the is loaded with four USB 3.2 gen1 ports and another for USB 3.2 gin two ports and memory speeds can be overclocked up to 48 hundred megahertz seriously this motherboard screams rainbows sunshine lollipop whatever you want to call it it's it's crazy to see so many features packed into a compact motherboard now speaking of memory I'm one with corsair dominator platinum 32 gigabyte kit clocked at 3600 megahertz this kit looks gorgeous and I love the matte black finish as it gives a really cool stealthy vibe and on top of an Corsair escape HELOCs RGB LEDs look fantastic now to cool the 3950X I went with NZXT Kraken X 60 to 280 mm eia cooler you don't necessarily need 8 to 80 mm solution to coldest processor because when we ran our benchmarks it went perfectly fine with an air cooler but since I am going ITX a IO seems to be the better option and the case seems to fit that cooler just fine for storage we're embracing AMD's PCI Gen 4 capabilities with X570 and so I decided to go with the saber and 1 terabyte rocket nvme Drive the name rocket certainly fits this Drive as it's insanely fast claiming read speeds up to 5 gigabytes per second and writes up to 4 point 4 gigabytes per second yep what a great time to be alive now check this out Saban actually includes this dryer with a heatsink and it looks ridiculous it features an aluminum heatsink with copper heat coils and a top heat spreader this thing is legit guys but unfortunately I won't be able to use it in my PC because it's just too big to fit inside the motherboard plus a motherboard does come with a heatsink on top of the chipset so it should get the job just fine in fact I think I might just end up using that heatsink as a display showcase and one of the shelving units that I plan on installing in my office so yeah it'll be cool I've also added an extra terabyte SSD from hynek's this will be my secondary drive for games and for my footage archiving the GP of choice is none other than the ROG Strix rtx 2080 Ti OC I chose this card for a few reasons one its Matlack and I love the aggressive look of this GPU secondly it runs a lot cooler compared to the founders Edition and given that I'm cramming this inside an ITX case means thermals had to be under control and this certainly delivers it's got a triple fan layout and Asus has implemented axial tech fans that shifts more air into the heatsink while maintaining lower noise levels it's also a 2.7 slot card which should fit the case that I'm using for this build and it's also got Asus aura support which means I can sing the colors with a motherboard with just one piece of software now to power the entire build I chose Corsair's SF750 small form-factor power supply this should be plenty enough to power the 3950X and the RTX 2080 TI as well as run efficiently since its 80-plus Platinum certified and on top of that it's fully modular now one of my favorite features of this PSU is that courser includes premium individually slave cables that should make cable management a breeze and now on to the case of choice and this one was definitely an interesting one because cramming all this power inside a small form-factor chassis isn't easy and I had to spend a lot of time looking for the ideal solution and so I decided to go with this lease tiger SM 750 it's roughly a 14 litre mini ith a C that's entirely made out of galvanized steel and then powder coated in black and I love the design of this thing it's minimalistic and it doesn't scream gamer e on the outside although the components going on the inside are I watery I'm sacrificing a little bit on the front IO coming from the define r6 as it only has one USB 3.1 type A and one type C port this case does support radiators up to 280 millimeters at the top so I shouldn't have any issues mounting the kraken X 62 and the side panels are windowed and they attach to the case via pegs so now that you're aware of all the components that's going inside my ITX system let's put it together so the system booted and it's running just fine but it took me a while to get there guys you see I learned a few things from this whole building process one I learned patience because building an ITX rig requires a lot of patience and that's something that I learned secondly I wish I planned it a little bit earlier as in planning the whole process a little bit earlier before approaching the building process because I ended up uninstalling a lot of the hardware and then reinstalling it back just to make sure that the cables routed appropriately things like your power supply cables fan cables all of those things required a lot of trial and error but it ended up working out just fine I use zip ties to secure the power supply cables to the chassis to make sure that they don't make any contact with the fan frames because I don't want them being caught by the fan blades because I'm using two 140 millimeter be quiet sound wing fence as intake and then the two radiator fans as exhaust for the CPU I'm pretty happy with the airflow configuration because it's drawing cool air from the bottom and then exhausting the hunt air for the top one of the things that surprised me the most was the clearance between the PCI riser card and the fan attached to the radiator because it's so close but it all worked out just fine the fan blades didn't catch anything so I'm glad that it's you know working out just fine in fact I'm really happy with the way how this build looks the RGB lighting looks great I love the RGB Dominator platinum memory and the NZXT cooler but at the same time the motherboard lighting the GPU lining all just looks so uniform now I certainly want to improve a few things in the future and one of them is cable management because I feel like I could do a little bit of a better job inside and secondly I do want to replace those two and 60 fans but some knocked off ends because they are bent louder than I thought they would so yeah that aside from that it's it's a pretty good-looking system I love it and now on to performance and hand this thing flies so I'm gonna compare this system to my current workstation PC which features an 80 okay overclock to four point eight gigahertz and an RTX 1080 Ti let's get started now writing some synthetic benchmarks I was completely in shock to see B performance improvement over my Hades sound under K overclocked at 4.8 gigahertz as you can see when Cinebench are 20 or 15 and even blender this thing just flies now I did take our standard 10-minute 4k project and rendered them in results to do on both these machines but interestingly enough I didn't notice a difference between them because as we all know resolve loves GPUs and it just the more GPUs are throught it the faster it renders it out although we are planning on investigating that a little bit later on I'm really looking for a video editing machine as well as a little bit of gaming on the side so both these systems are great but I'm really happy to see that thing run just as fast as this guy so you know that's awesome now I was really interested to test the thermals on my ITX rig and so I took our standard blender test and a rennet on the loop and the 3950X only averaged around 63 see with the kraken X 62 aia cooler but my 8700k overclocked to 4.0 gigahertz averaged or maxed out at 73 c so it ran hotter compared to my 1350 yes that's just that's crazy guys that really is finally I ran some gaming benchmarks on both these systems at 4k as that is my desired resolution when it comes to gaming since I have a 4k monitor and both these systems ran similarly which makes sense because they both Rock RTX 2080 ti's and when you're gaming at 4k it's more taxing on the GPU than the CPU so if you're looking for a gaming system and an ITX form factor you don't have to go for a 3950X you're actually better off with a lower core comp processor and a faster GPU so that's my new workstation PC and I hope you guys enjoyed this one in fact if you have any cable management tips definitely let me know in the comments down below because this is my first ITX rig and I would love to get feedback in terms of improvements for this PC I'm Eva with hurricane axe thank you so much watching make sure to check out some relevant content over here subscribe and hit that notification bell so that you don't miss out on a video I'm signing off and I'll talk to you guys in the next one",

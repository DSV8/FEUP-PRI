    "transcript": "There's one thing I haven't done in a very long time here on the channel, and that's make a video about Beats headphones. Now they're very popular, they've recently got purchased by Apple and that has all kinds of implications and that's the reason for this video right here But in general, these are very expensive headphones and they're not going to be for everybody That said, the Beats Solo3 Wireless are the first headphones available to take advantage of Apple's new pairing process Of course we'll be testing them out as well On the back here you can see wireless bluetooth, battery for 40 hours Five minute charging equals 3 hours of play Thats, I mean that's pretty good Special edition rose gold, look at this Very factory fresh inside Nice little carrying pouch a carabiner when Jack was a kid his nickname was actually Beans so let's bring it back hit the comments section say hello to Beans let's see how many Beans we can get in the comments section. Ain't that right Beans. And then there's a cable you might want to use these with something other than an Iphone i like to use them on the airplane and of course as you know there's no bluetooth to the airplanes entertainment system and every so often you've got you've got a banger on there that you just need to watch. Are you going to get there cheeseball headphones they've got on the airplane or are you going to use your own. Anyway it's in there, unboxing experience A+ as usual, factory fresh smell on another level. Look at that rose gold rep the rose gold folks For now these are the very first ones that have this new streamlined wireless pairing process adjustable, the earcups are on ear style Uh See you got a button there play pause, this is where you connect your cable if you choose to go that route, here's your micro USB for charging it up and here's your power indicator which shows that i've got full battery right now and this guy is starting to flash assuming that it is ready to be paired to a phone so LOOK OH MY came righ- I didn't do- i do anything unlocked to connect ok click there touch ID connecting done shows me the battery life a hundred percent battery life and I'm done It's the little things so now if you're using the same iCloud account across devices those devices now recognize the existence of these headphones if it's a laptop, an iPad, an Apple Watch it all interacts like a happy family. Let's test out the sound do have soundcloud on here yet? Come on Lew man get your act together look at that I got the robocop still on there I told you already Total Recall Terminator, Bloodsport, Van Damme in the day DAHH! I need to tell you I need to do something about the Beats thing here super popular then you got us people on the internet and we're all like: \"There are other headphones in the world in the have you ever heard of Sennheiser and various other German names? Hahaha\" Tech people just chill out a little bit of all right please, because what you're doing is you're putting yourself in a silo and you're isolating yourself from the rest of the world. The rest of the world is complicated just like everywhere else in life. Perception is reality there's marketing there's endorsements this all it's a whole package. You don't walk up to some woman with Gucci bag and slap it out of there and go: \"You could have been carrying a shopping bag\" This is a package deal and in reality if you want a certain image you always pay for that image branding its sophisticated if LeBron James has the headphones on for years it matters. That is going to affect perception maybe my coffee was extra strong today. Okay! I feel like this product, the Beats brand it's not as good as people think but it's not as bad as people think if you know what I'm saying there's an accentuation on the low end. They're expensive that i will agree with you on the ease of connectivity that's going to be meaningful to people it's going to be valuable to people. Stop harassing people who wear rose gold headphones, they're enjoying themselves just like you can get lost in his role rose gold solos. Right leave me alone.",

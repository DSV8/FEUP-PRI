    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and today is an extremely exciting video. I know I say that a lot of videos I make are exciting, but this one is even more exciting because today, I am going to Jonathan's studio and we are surprising a girl name Arielle. Some of you may know of her because he's made videos about her in the past but I'm gonna put a link in the description if you wanna check it out. It's a link to her GoFundMe page; you can find out more about her and her story. So, we're gonna head in here very shortly. So, she doesn't know that I'm gonna be here, so Jonathan set this whole thing up, he has one of her favorite bands performing and we're also surprising her with an iPhone at an Apple Watch! This is gonna be incredible, we also brought Matty too, Matty! We're gonna surprise Arielle! We also brought Jenna too, Jenna's here to surprise. - I am. - And Tyler's here too. - [Jenna] Tyler! - Here, you can do this. (upbeat music) Okay, so we're here. - Yes. - This is so exciting, I mean you've been planning this for a while. - It's been like over a year. - How long have you known Arielle? - So, she's been a supporter of the tech audience forever. - Yeah. - But I've got a chance to like, know her, know her over the past year and a half and she's even cooler in person. - This is incredible. So, walk me through what's gonna happen right now. - So, Arielle is chilling, I'm gonna go get her, I'm gonna taker her and let her know that we're hanging with Terror Jr, which is one of her favorite groups. She can hang out, watch them record an acoustic performance and then by the end of that you'll start walking in and bust in like, Santa Justine. - This is gonna be great, we're getting her and her sister iPhones and Apple Watches. Like, this is gonna be awesome but thanks for making this all happen and I'm so excited to see her face. - Thank you so, let's go. - It's gonna be great. Okay, how many, how many minutes? - It's probably like seven. - [Justine] Seven minutes? - So, check your phone. - [Justine] Okay - Or your watch. (laughing) - So now we wait, so he's gonna text me when it's time, and then we go. Jonathan said to come over in six minutes, it has been like four minutes, we're gonna get a head start just to get there, in case I get lost. Okay Matty, you ready? Jenna's gonna take you. I'm gonna grab the bag of goodies. This is where the real surprise is. Oh my gosh, I hope she's enjoying her first prize. (suspenseful music) - I guess we'll lead the way. (laughing) - I'm so nervous. I can hear them performing. Jonathan said now, he said now, he said now! Hello? - There's a performance going on up here. - Oh sorry, I have Postmates. (laughing) Did you guys order some stuff? - [Jonathan] Yes. - Is this the right place? - [Arielle] Oh my, surely I picked it. - Is this Postmates here? - It's, I only do Uber Eats, I'm sorry. - Hi I'm Justine, I'm your Postmates today. (laughing) How are you? - I'm good. (laughing) - Matty is also here, our dog. - I know.

So his Instagram is DJMiniMatt and he has his own little DJ set and he DJs, so-- - [David] Is he, where do I book? - [Justine] Through his DMs. (laughing) - [Jonathan] Aww. - Cool, can we do one more song for you? - Yes please. - Yes! 95 On the interstate Looking for a dinner plate I'm hungry You called me Say you've got something and it's all me Can you Hold me Down from one night Like I got three strikes I need you To free me It's a prison inside my mind Break me Taste me Roll me up like the Northern Lights Like I got three strikes (applauding) - [Jenna] All right, that was awesome. - All right, we didn't mess up that one! (laughing) - That was so good! - [Jonathan] Thanks for sharing your presence today. - Yes! - I really thought it was Postmates. (laughing) - [David] I did too! I was like, \"ah, Postmates, they never get the message, like, come on, \"we're busy in here.\" - Thank you for making this all happen, for coordinating. - Yeah it's-- - [Justine] You're stressed aren't you? - No, it was, there was a lot of moving processes. - Okay, so we had the surprise and I walked up and I acted like I was Postmates. Did you guys actually think I was Postmates? - Yes, yes I did. (laughing) I literally thought you were like, just breaking in and, oh my God, I'm so silly. - Well, I recognized your voice. - [Justine] Aw, I gave it away! - So I started thinking and then I saw his head. - Oh, then you saw Matty! Matty ran up there to be a part of the show. (laughing) That's awesome, well it was so nice to meet you! - Yeah, oh my gosh. - This was amazing. - It's insane. - It was so nice to meet you too. - You as well. - Well, thank you guys so much, make sure you go check out, all the links below that I will be putting in the description and I will see you later and Jonathan, thank you so much for coordinating all of this! - Thank you, of course. - He could tell he was super stressed, he's like coordinating everything, like trying to make sure we're all here and it worked so thank you. - Yes, thank you.

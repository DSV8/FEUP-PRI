    "transcript": "- A portion of this video is sponsored by Plugable. On the last episode of MrMobile Stays Home. I reviewed the single most important product that kept me sane during the New York City shelter in place order my Samsung the Frame TV. Now new York's become a little more relaxed since April, and I've been able to take some day trips to the country to show up phone cameras and Erie radar towers, but let's face it. Most of us non-essential folks are still spending most of our time at home. And I've collected a new cluster of products to make that time more productive but hopefully cleaner, and definitely more fun. (upbeat music) Let's start by getting cleaner. Ask any junior high biology student, and they'll tell you your mobile devices absolutely gross. One study back in 2017, found that some phones carried 10 times more bacteria than a toilet seat. So for the past six years, a company called PhoneSoap has offered this simple solution. A small chamber with two lighting elements that blast whatever you stick inside with UV-C ultra violet light. Now that C is important, it's the part of the UV spectrum most damaging to bacterial DNA. And it also happens to be the part of the spectrum, the earth atmosphere protects us from. So that's why you can't leave your phone out on the rooftop at high noon on a sunny day and expect the same results. Anyway, 10 minutes later, the light turns off and your possessions come out with up to 99.99% of household germs killed now according to PhoneSoap. To me, that sounded a little too good to be true, so I checked out the US National Library of Medicine who study on UV-C sanitizers found that whoa, yeah, they do kill bacteria. And they cause enough damage to some viruses that those viruses can no longer reproduce. Now I know what you're thinking, and sadly, while that includes the Coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS. According to reporting from both CNN and CNET lab grade samples of COVID-19 are hard to come by, which explains why COVID killer isn't front and center of PhoneSoaps website. The company can't make that claim without rigorous testing, which I guess it can't do, or maybe it just feels like it doesn't need to, even at between 80 and 120 bucks PhoneSoap devices have been flying off the shelf since March, even without that assurance. And even despite testing by sites like review.com that indicates some inconsistency in its effectiveness. I have my own complaints, but they're more usability oriented. I wish it was bigger, so I could fit my earbuds cases in there. And you know, a product that costs this much should probably look and feel a little less plastic-y. But it does have thoughtful features like the ability to charge your device while it's disinfecting. And more to the point, given the choice between rubbing down all my pocketable with alcohol every day, or just tossing them in the PhoneSoap for 10 minutes, I'll take the PhoneSoap, even if I'm not fully sold on its effectiveness when comes to viruses. Now with a home is full of tech as this one is, I can never really find enough solutions to charge them. So here's three more, which are pretty interesting. I know chargers are hardly the sexiest thing around, but what I like about the Aukey Omnia line of chargers is that they use gallium nitride technology, aka GaN, which means the bigger one here can kick out the hundred watts of power my MacBook Pro demands while taking up much less space than Apple's MacBook Pro charger. Now other manufacturers make GaN chargers too, Aukey just the one that's having to send me these. And there are also 60 wide versions. If you wanna go even smaller and still have much more power than your phone could ever soak up. Next step, y'all know I love my wireless chargers and I have way too many in the house. So I almost said no, when some products that's sum offered to send me three of theirs, but I'm really glad I said yes, this first one, their disc is just kind of whatever. It's a nine watt glass and aluminum plate that in my view, doesn't come close to justifying at $60 price point, even though it does look pretty nice. The dial is where it gets cool, It's even price here at a hundred bucks, but it does something I haven't seen from almost any other wireless charger, it twists. So your phone can either lie flat or sit at an angle on the silicone rubber base. So you can keep an eye on your screen while it charges at 10 watt. A sum is also launching a new product called the DROP & DOCK that marries a wireless charger with a portable battery. So you can take a wireless charger kind of anywhere. I've seen plenty of these before, but not in this cool stacked configuration. Yeah, it's minimal, it's clever. And it's live on Kickstarter as this video hits the feet. And I wanna get to the fun stuff, so let's wrap up the charging section. We all have that one device, we just can't let go of that demands an old charging cable. For me, it's the Bose SoundWear I reviewed a few years back and still use literally every day. That's where the universal cable from Nomad Goods comes in. It's a USB C cable at its core, but when I need to charge older tech, I just snap on the micro USB adapter that lives on a small strap near the end. And if I find myself in a car or using a computer with only USB A ports, well, I've got that adapter at the other end. The whole thing is covered in Cavaliers, so it feels like you could pull a truck trailer with it. And at three meters long, I can sneak it anywhere it needs to go. 40 bucks, yeah, it's a lot of money, but in this case it is totally worth it. I know I'm hardly the only person playing Microsoft Flight Simulator this season. But if the headlines are to be believed, I am one of the few people who managed to get an order for a hands-on throttle-and-stick in time to use them with the game. Those controls and the overpowered gaming laptop I'm using to test them after a quick word from the sponsor, that's made my work from home battle station possible. This portion of today's video is sponsored by Plugable who sent over these three USB devices to bring me out of the basement. You see normally if I want dual desktops, I have to go down to my office where daylight is meager, where pluggables docking stations give me all the interfaces I need to bring that set up top side. While my laptop stays juiced up with 60 watt power delivery, I can wirelessly charge my phone, top up my smartwatch, connect to external monitors and use pretty much any other USB peripheral. And this Thunderbolt 3 dock looks sharp enough that you probably won't want to hide it. But if you have a more minimalist aesthetic, they're single display, USB C mini docking station mounts to the back of your monitor to keep it out of sight, keep things tidy. As for that portable SSD, well with two terabytes of storage for the giant video files, I'm constantly running to and from the studio and Thunderbolt 3 transfer speeds, it's as good a companion at home as it would be on the road. Hit the link below to check out Pluggables entire catalog, which is backed by a two year warranty, US-based customer service and a commitment to provide better support than any traditional electronics company. Thanks to Plugable for sponsoring this portion of the video. Now a few thing in this setup, looks like a better match for Star Wars Squadrons than Microsoft Flight Simulator. Congratulations, you know, me, here's the thing. After years of scratching my space combat itch with nineties classics like X-Wing Alliance and equally nineties joysticks from Thrustmaster and Suncom. I finally decided I'd had enough dancing with dongles and ordered a collection of contemporary controls, starting with the Thrustmaster Hotas Warthog. The Warthog is named after the 8, 10 attack aircraft whose flight controls it's modeled after. But while I respect the 8, 10, I'm a long Island kid who grew up down the road from the Grumman plant that built the F-14. So I've craved a proper Tomcat grip since I saw a top gun. Well, as it turns out a company called VIRPIL Controls out of Lithuania, makes a great replica called the VFX and it's compatible with the Warthog base. And while I was shopping for that, well, of course I had to catch a glimpse of the VIRPIL mongoos throttle (laughs) maybe it was the hazard striping, maybe it was the meaty thrust levers, maybe it was the 29 programmable buttons and switches, but I knew I had to have it for my eventual entanglements over indoor. Over the past few weeks, I've used the VFX stick, mostly an X-Wing Alliance, which despite its age still lets you program weapons selection to the stick switch. So you can declare that you're too close for torpedoes, switching the lasers. Now look, if you're buying this stuff, do more research than I did. I didn't realize that the Thrustmaster base doesn't actually support all the VFX grips features like the DLC thumbwheel made to help Tomcat pilots land on carriers or the twist access for rudder inputs. And when it comes to Microsoft Flight Simulator, that game actually has a default profile for the Warthog. Who's added hat switches also make it easier to look around the cockpit and trim the aircraft. Other points in the Warthogs favor and could the heavy metal build, cool to the touch every time and superior ergonomics when compared with the plastic VFX grip. The mongoos Throttle is just as plastic, and frankly it was a bear to set up with software that feels like something out of mech warrior that took me a couple hours to properly configure. But now that I'm settled in, I love the sheer number of controls I can assign from landing gear to windshield defrost, to the hats which I use for a rudder input because I haven't yet ordered a pair of pedals. Combined cost for all this stuff is about $950. I know it was a lot, but hey, it's gonna be a long winter. And finally, all that flying has been done on the latest full-sized laptop to hit my review desk. The ROG Zephyrus Duo from ASUS, normally gaming laptops aren't really my bag, but this is the defacto sequel to the ZenBook Pro Duo I've been using for almost a year. A Duo of course, because of this addictive second display that sits above the keyboard, and the new one corrects one of my key complaints from the ZenBook by mechanically, propping that monitor up when the laptop is opened, which reduces glare and goes easier on your neck. The other reason I asked for this test drive, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 is being called the new crisis because of its extreme system requirements. And this Zephyrus Duo packs one of the most stellar spec sheets you can find in a laptop. With just as important, the twin screens are perfect, because flight simulator lets you pop out different instruments and dialog boxes that you can then stick down there, keeping your field of view clear for flying. Even with the core i9 and an Nvidia 2080 super graphics card, I can only get acceptable frame rates in the second highest graphic setting. But honestly, being able to fly anywhere in the world from buzzing my old college campus at ODU to flying under the golden gate bridge while completely covered in Karl the fog and seeing those places rendered in satellite detail, it's exactly what I'm gonna need when the mercury drops and it comes time to fight off the next round of cabin fever. A full review of this machine is coming soon and I have a feeling I'm gonna have a great time evaluating it.

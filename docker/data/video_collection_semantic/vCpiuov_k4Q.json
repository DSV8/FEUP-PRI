    "transcript": "- Well, well, Mr. Google. (chuckles) You gave us one more phone. Let's see if it takes the cake. Google's been trying to make Pixel phones a thing for, well, five years is how long Pixels have been around. But before that, they were making Nexus phones, I think since 2010? And they just really, they've struggled with what the heck a Google phone is. Is it a really nice Android experience that's built by another company? Is it like an iPhone type thing that's built entirely by Google? But now the Pixel is for the first time more of a Google phone than ever before, right on down to the silicon. They got some sand and they molded it into their little- Look, it's the Google logo. For that reason, I've been kind of excited about the Pixel 6. I have a Pixel 3 because I'm a Pixel boy, and now they're finally here. So, it's time to do it. Are you ready? Are you ready, kids? - [David] Aye aye, Riley. (Riley laughing) - Whoa, it's a pop-up. Google, what are you? What, do you think we're kids? I'm not impressed. Just kidding, that's kinda fun. Let's look at the actual phones. \"Google Pixel 6 for all you are.\" After many years of Google Pixel phones, like the 4, 4A with 5G, and then the 5, and then the 5A, it was just kind of like, they were taking the same phone and just kind of tweaking it a little bit, and it was never really that impressive. So, this is a major change and we are excited. Yes, honey. We are excited. Yes, honey. We stan a Pixel. I would have loved to have the Pixel 6 here, because if I was gonna buy one, I would have probably bought the Pixel 6. The 6 and the 6 Pro are actually pretty different phones: different cameras, different display, some other stuff. Let's unbox it real quick. They took a bite out of Apple. - [David] Oh. - Now Apple is bleeding on the floor. Is there stuff under here? Oh, I ripped it. (box tumbling) Pixel 6 Pro. Black, which is the only proper option. - [David] What? - To get for a phone. - Why? - You're gonna put a case on it anyway, Who cares what color it is, it's in your pocket most of the time. You want to be like using your phone and be like, \"I hope everyone else sees how good this color is of my phone.\" Who cares? It's a tool. So right away, we see the most contentious part of this phone's design. This giant camera bar with like a sharp, can you see that? It's not like there's a smooth gradation to go up from the back up to the camera bump. Like it's a bump. I feel like if you're gonna do a big camera bump, you might as well make it a bar like this because you set it down and it's not wobbly. It's very stable. You could build a house on there. Maybe you can't see it so good on the camera, but like you can kind of see there's an appearance of depth to it. And that's because the telephoto lens, which I think that's the telephoto lens, uses these folded optics. It's like the Periscope camera situation. It's an op - it's an illusion. Magic. David Copperfield made this phone. I wish. It's not a bad width. I'm kind of a one-handed phone guy, and that's why I got the Pixel 3 instead of the Pixel 3 XL. It's still a bit of a stretch, but maybe I could use it, I don't know. All right, before we get too much into that, let's see what else in the box. Not a power adapter, 'cause that's the trend. Apple started it, everyone follows. We got a type C cable, and then we got a type C to A adapter, which is always appreciated. I mean, if you're not gonna have a power adapter, give me a doohickey. And then we've got a SIM removal tool and a manual or something, warranty. I'm not gonna look at that. Oh, there's a case. All right, let's put that in there. Real nice. Yeah, overall I liked the feel of the phone. I mean it's a phone. They did include this like waterfall edge type of situation. Like it's like a Galaxy S7 Edge. And I don't know if I love this, I haven't really tried a phone for a long time with a curved edge like that. But it's there. The Pixel 6 non-Pro does not have the curved edge, so if you're not a fan, that's an option. No headphone Jack, USB type C only, hopefully, the headphone jack is coming in the 6A. Maybe I just wait for that one. I don't know. But it looks like dual speakers on the bottom, but we'll find out once we dive into the phone and start testing out some of the features. - [Jono] Wait - Huh? - [Jono] Sponsor. - Sponsor? (laughing) - [Jono] dbrand, wear this. - (Riley laughing) Why? - [Jono] Just wear it. - I'm protected. - [Jono] Check this out. (items hitting) - Oh God what. - Pastel Orange Pixel 6 Pro back grips skin matte black. Our buddy, matte black. Oh, it's a grip case. I like the look of that. These are racing stripes. Does this make the phone faster? You didn't even hit me that time. (ball bouncing) Come on. Geez, Louise. Alright. (ball bouncing) (Jono laughing) Headbutt. Oh, it almost, am I even doing it right? (ball bouncing) (Riley screaming) - [Jono] Faster. - If you're gonna to put on the skin. if you're gonna take the time to do that, it should look perfect. (guys offscreen laughing) I mean- (item banging). - Oh. - Whoa, ah, my God (Riley yells) (guys offscreen laughing) (item banging) Never. (item banging) (sighs) Braced for that one. (item banging) There we go. Skins on boom. Alright. There you go. Deeper. (mask hitting mic) (balls bouncing) (guys offscreen laughing) (Riley heavy breathing) Alright. This thing feels secure now. And look, everyone will look at my skin on my case and think that I'm very cool. Thanks dbrand. (guys offscreen laughing) Alright, here we go. Let's open it up. One thing that's kind of cool about Android 12 is this new mic access and camera access buttons in the quick settings. So, you can just like turn that off if you're like, \"I don't want, even if my phone does get hacked, it's probably hacked right now. But the hackers can't listen or see me, thanks to these two toggles.\" Alright. But the big thing about the Pixels is always the camera. And with this one, it's the chip as well. Google tensor, but Google tensor is using its machine learning chops apparently to enable some kind of cool machine learning type photo features. And the first one is magic eraser. So, magic eraser is basically kind of like Photoshop content aware fill for your phone. But now it's gonna be like right in your camera app. (camera clicking) Okay. Thanks Jono. (Jono murmuring) You can stay back there. Okay. (laughing) You could, I mean, actually you should probably, can you see him? You're the best Jono. You're the best Jono anyone knows. (ball bouncing) Ah, it wants me to erase the Ellie statue, that's not very nice Google. - [David] Let's try it. Try it? Yeah Okay. Let's see what happens. Ah, alright. Boom. She's gone. (guys surprised gasps) Just like what happened in the game. I haven't played it. (David laughing) Don't spoil it. - [David] Dumbledore. - Dumbledore kills Ellie (laughing). (David laughing) - Well, it's been fun Jono, but you're about to enter the Nether zone, the Phantom zone. - [David] the Nether regions. - the Nether regions. - [Jono] Don't touch me - I'm gonna touch you. (guys offscreen laughing) Don't include that. Alright. It's gonna be- (guys offscreen overlap chatter) - [David] It won't do it Its a shelf with complex items- - [Riley] Boom. - Whoa. (laughing) (everyone laughing) Okay. So like, obviously that's not, that's not what the shelf looks like, but, (everyone laughing) but if you look from far away, you would have never noticed that a man had just died and snapped out of existence. (guys offscreen laughing) I'm gonna raise the shelf. (Riley buzzing) Oh, okay. Now it just looks like there's a bunch of black mold there. What else should we erase? I feel drunk with power. I can erase anything. - Whoa. - See, that's pretty cool. I mean like, okay, I'm a Photoshop guy. I make the thumbnails for Tech Link. I'm well aware of what content aware fill can and can't do. But I know that when I've recently learned about it a number of years ago, I thought that was really cool. And now it's like, we can do the exact same thing on our phone. It takes a second. It's so quick. Plants don't need 'em. There's too many on the Earth already. Get rid of all the plants I'd say. Look at that. (Riley laughing) Oh, did you see that? I was like doing stuff there and Jono on the shelf was like, boom (everyone laughing) Oh, if I just tap and hold it shows the original. (guys offscreen oohing) That's pretty cool. Let's- Real quick, we're gonna erase basically everything we can see and see- (everyone laughing) See at which point things start looking real bad. (speed up reel sound effect) - Whoa dude. - It's taking- (everyone laughing) And done. (everyone laughing) We made art today people. Nice job. Nice job everybody. - [Jono] Sell it as an NFT - (Riley laughing) We should sell this as an NFT. I mean, hey, that was pretty good. I mean, when I saw it demoed on the live stream, I was kind of like, \"Okay, but is it gonna be that good? It's a phone.\" But like I would never have expected a mobile chip could do this this fast and this well. So, that's actually really impressive. Now, there are a couple other camera features. Let's do face unblur. Pretend you're possessed (groaning) Now jump. Jump. Yeah. - [David] Now take off your shirt. - Alright (Riley laughing) (David laughing) Okay great. You're face in all of these photos was perfectly clear. (laughing) - [Jono] Are you serious? - So, I mean, Hey, that's saying something about the camera right there. Alright. Well, face deblur was like the least impressive one anyways. Motion mode. So like, instead of unblurring things, you can add blur to things, and that's supposed to like make things kind of like a, you can make like an artsy waterfall with the waterfall go on, cool. I don't know. So, let's see if it does anything with this. This is probably the best photo I think of you in a while Jono. Tools. There's just blur, which I guess is like, makes it a portrait thing. Oh, you need to take the photo. Wait, what? Use motion mode to take an action pan or long exposure photo. Well, that's kind of annoying (laughing). So like in order to use these modes, you have to activate the mode and then take the photo. From the photos that we took during this whole testing process that turned out not to be that useful. (guys offscreen laughing) The photos looked pretty good. I mean, they're Pixel photos and I think you're gonna need a deeper dive in order to find out whether the photos that this is gonna take is significantly better than an iPhone 13 Pro Max or whatever. I don't want to say that I'm like not expecting this camera to be good because I expect this one to be really good, especially with the new Google tensor stuff. But one of the other things that was pretty impressive in the keynote is the fact that they had Marie Kondo come on and talk about live translate because apparently the Google tensor chip isn't just good for machine learning with photos and stuff. It's also better at doing this live translate stuff on device, I think. I think it's supposed to not use the internet for any of this stuff. But we need someone to- Hey, Andy. (laughing) speaking of someone who speaks a different language. Andy, would you ever consider buying a Google phone? (Google phone speaks foreign language) (beep sound) (Andy speaks foreign language) - Only Apple. Why is that, what's wrong with Google? - [Jono] It doesn't dictate it? - What? Wait. - [Google Phone] I will consider buying an Apple mobile phone only. (beep sound) - That was so confusing. It came up with the translation right away, but then it like processed some more. And then the lady talked (laughing) (guys offscreen laughing) Why do you love Apple so much? (Google phone speaks foreign language) (beep sound) (Andy speaks foreign language) [Google Phone] Because you need to subscribe to messages. (everyone laughing) - [Riley] Okay that's understandable though because I didn't know what Mac Address was. (Google phone speaks foreign language) Yeah, alright, alright. This is frustrating. (everyone laughing) - [Andy] So it works? - [Riley] It works. Are you a big fan of Marie Kondo? (Google phone speaks foreign language) (beep sound) (Andy speaks foreign language) - [Google Phone] May I ask who is horsepower? - Horsepower? - [Andy] What? (everyone laughing) - Now someone's trying to connect. Alright. (laughing) - It works. - We got the idea. (laughing) Thanks, Andy. (laughing) (Google phone speaks foreign language) - Absolutely, I agree with you (laughing) I mean, that seemed like a little bit faster than I've seen it go before, but like it wasn't life-changing. So, the Pixel 6 Pro starts at $899, the Pixel 6 non-Pro starts at $599, which is actually really impressive. Google is trying to do the same thing that Apple is doing with the iPhone, where there is like a regular iPhone for most people. And then there's a Pro iPhone that is more expensive and it actually has a lot more interesting features. Like, there's a QHD plus display on this thing. And there's a FHD, like 1080P to be on the non-Pro. There's 12 gigs of RAMs instead of 8 gigs of RAM. So, the 6 non-Pro has a 90 Hertz display, just like the Pixel 5, but the Pro has a 120 Hertz display which I kind of, I said earlier, I'm not sure if we talked about it, but go it just like scrolling through the settings is, I feel like it's very noticeable. There's also better gorilla glass, but a little bit bigger battery. But other than that, they haven't indicated that the actual processor in the 6 Pro is gonna be any better than the one in the 6. They're not going full Apple yet with like, this is a 100% completely different phone than the lower tier one. But they are starting to kind of get into that territory of \"We're making a normal phone and then we're making a balls to the wall phone.\" Crab rave. (upbeat clacking music) I gotta say the stupidest thing about the bezel on the whole screen bit has been the loss of the front-facing speakers. When phones used to have speakers on both sides of the top and bottom of the phone. That was in my opinion, that was better. Let's keep going. (laughing) (upbeat music) Sounds pretty tinny for this part. (upbeat music) If I put it right next to my ear it sounds a lot better, but like when you put it on a table, that doesn't, bleh. (phone hitting table) Comparison to what, what is this? - [Jono] iPhone 13 Pro. (upbeat music) I feel like that's better, right? (music pauses) (music resumes) Oh, that's way better. (guys offscreen laughing) That sounds a little better at max volume. Huh, that might change things a bit. At max volume, the 6 Pro has more bass, I feel like it's fleshed out a little bit more with the base and mids. But at lower volumes, this sounds pretty tinny, and this one sounds better. If you buy phones solely based on how they sound at max volume, get the 6 Pro. - [David] Hell yeah. We are watching HDR content on Squid Game on Netflix. One second. - [David] No, then we can't see it. - I'll let you see you in one second. Have a determination. This is way darker. - Oh yeah. - That's a huge difference. (guys offscreen oohing) Is that just overall brightness or is that HDR? I think it is overall brightness. The iPhone's just brighter. - [Jono] Has a better screen. - I think everything is just darker here than this one. If you never compare your phone to another phone, it'll look great. (guys offscreen laughing) Also, there might be something with the settings or something. We might've screwed that up. So again, that's LDT territory. This is a short circuit. (Riley banging table) Dammit. Last thing I wanted to check out was the fingerprint sensor. This is the first Pixel phone, I believe with an under screen fingerprint reader, which is pretty standard among a lot of flagship phones these days. So, I trained it on my thumb and that was pretty quick. I mean, not much to complain about there. I still prefer the back mounted one just because it's so much easier to like, take it out of your pocket and unlock it as you take your phone, like to pick your phone up. - No. - Yeah. It's the most exciting Pixel in my opinion. For many years, just because of the fact that we've got this new processor, they've shaken up the design a lot. They've got some really interesting camera features where in the past, they've just kind of been like, \"Oh, it's better. You can take photos of stars.\" But overall, very impressed. And I feel like I'm still gonna wait for the 6A though for the headphone jack. (laughing) Alright. Well, that's it for this short circuit. Thanks for watching everybody. Hey, why don't you subscribe to They're Just Movies. - Yeah. - Just kidding. Subscribe to Tech Linked. (Jono laughing)",

    "transcript": "- So, another video. Do I still have to do the \"what's up guys\" thing? Is it a trademark, if you will? What's up, guys. Lew here, and I'm still making videos whether you like it or not. Today we're talkin' about a lamp. This is a weird one. You're like, \"A lamp? \"Lew, not tunin' in for lamps.\" Well, this is not your everyday average lamp. I wouldn't bring that to you. I would only bring you a lamp if it did somethin' special, and this that lamp. This lamp will charge your phone. I think it' pretty cool, so let's go ahead, find out what this thing is all about. This is a very important part of any lamp. It's a lamp shade. Little wrench. The actual electronic part of the lamp. That's it. That's the cool section for all the cool kids. Now the reason that I like a lamp that charges your phone, I mean there are other pieces of furniture out there like tables and stuff. But the problem with the table is a table is not something that you normally plug in, right? So having to run something down there and plug it into the wall, now your table's plugged in. I mean I guess it's not a huge deal. But a lamp, on the other hand, well, that's plugged in, anyways. Plus it's got light. And if you got one of these, cool Phillips Hue Bulbs, all of a sudden now you got different colors, you got ambiance. You're gonna impress the ladies. Just ask Jack what happened. He put one of these little LED bulbs next to his bed, next thing you know he's got a new girlfriend. He's been buying a new place. He's going on vacation next week. That's the kind of stuff that might happen for you with a fancy colorful lightbulb. Jack, that's staying in the video. I don't care what you say. Should I look at the instructions here? I guess I have to, right? Uck. Oh, wow, there's a USB on the front, too. Check that out. See that? So if your device doesn't support wireless charging, all of a sudden now you still get a fresh USB. I like that, Ikea. Now you know as well if anybody stands a chance at putting wireless charging in everyone's home, it's probably the Swedish. They'll convince you with their Swedish meatballs. This video is off the rails in a way like almost like we've never been on the rails. He's upset, he's got a question. But he calls Ikea and everything's better. All right, wrench time here. Man, check out this, this little wrench here. Bingo. You know what I do like so far about this lamp beyond the fact that it's super high tech? There's a lamp in front. (laughter) What I do like about this lamp, it seems actually like pretty high quality. This braided power cable, that's, that's a good look. Ah, we take that off. Look at this friendly little lamp right here. Bulb, I have a fancy bulb. They go all kinds of different colors. You have an app for it so you can control it from your smart phone. It's a high-tech lamp. Let's give it a high-tech bulb. 25,000 hours. I mean, how long is that even? Is that my whole life? This video's not about bulbs. Well, it is, but it isn't. It's about the lamp. Let's give this baby some juice. This is the moment of truth right here. What do you want me to do? So you want me to just. Oh, how cool. Jack. Just drop it on, you're charging. Now imagine this thing is beside your bed. That's genius. So the next thing is can you just be a lamp, too. Let's see here. Yes, you can. (soothing music) So the lamp is now connected. You can probably, I don't know if you can see this app here. With the Phillips Hue Bulb, you're getting a dimmer essentially, which the lamp doesn't have by default. Whoo, look at that. A little pink for you. Maybe some blue. Match the sweater. Go over to some red there. Green. Look at that. Holy smoke, see? Hello. So now I don't know, we might have the highest tech, you can turn the light back on now. We might have the highest tech lamp on the planet right now. Colorful bulbs controlled by a phone, wireless charging, USB port built right in. High tech for you guys. I'm box therapy, people. You just got it. Coolest lamp on the planet? Quite possibly. Did you charge your phone with your lamp last night? Maybe. After you got this, definitely. Go to school the next day. Guess how I charged my phone? With my lamp. That's right, teacher. Here's your apple. I'l take an A plus, please. Woo! I'm in this. Chase me. Ah! (digital music) He throws the knife at me?",

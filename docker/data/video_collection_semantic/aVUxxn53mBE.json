    "transcript": "Dasung promised that their paper like you would be the world's first e-ink monitor that was actually usable. We felt usable was a pretty strong word. There's supposed to be text up here. You're terrifying here. But nevermind that, they said. We have a new monitor that will be more powerful, more sexy, and more colorful than you could possibly imagine. Okay, wait though, colored e-ink? Now they've got my attention, and apparently yours as well. Here it is. Okay, that's pretty cool. Boasting 3K resolution, the 25.3-inch paper-like color boasts full color, ultra-speed refresh rate, special X-colored filter technology, a multicolored front light, and even a stylish backlight. But is the grass really greener now that the grass is really green? Well, you guys saw the title so you know it's gonna be a little complicated So let's dive into the tech that makes this thing tick and see how it handles everything from The use case that it was designed for to ones that are oh Funnier like this funny segue To our sponsor war thunder you got to admit it would be pretty cool to fly a jet or drive a tank Well War Thunder's gameplay is about as close as you can get from the comfort of home Play for free at the link below E Ink, the Kleenex of electrophoretic displays, works by suspending charged pigment particles in a capsule filled with viscous liquid The capsule gets placed between two transparent electrodes that can send a charge Either attracting the particles to one side or attracting them to the other side of the capsule If you zoom way in and you slow things down a bit, you can actually see the individual particles floating to the surface of the capsule Then you just take a bunch of those capsules, put them in an array, and boom, you got an E Ink display. But how does color work? Oh, okay. One thing you could do is you could add colored pigment to your capsules. But now hold on a second, if all we can have is a positive or a negative charge, well, how do we make sure that it's the colored particles that rise to the surface of the capsule? Well, we can change the size of the particle. If we add slightly larger particles to the mix, . then we can take advantage of the momentum of larger particles. So we can hold the positive charge just a bit longer, and those larger particles will accelerate and smash their way to the top, pushing the smaller particles out of the way. But wait a second, hold the charge longer. . You mean even longer than a black-and-white E-Ink display? Yeah, like two frames per minute longer. So clearly Dasung had to go a different route. Let's take a closer look. Using this handy-dandy USB microscope, we can zoom way in on this monitor and see exactly what's going on here. Would you look at that? Just like the monitor or TV that you're watching this on right now, it uses a color filter on top of the E-Ink layer. But if we look closely here, things get pretty weird. What is this subpixel layout? Okay, we need red, green, and blue in order to make white, right? So here's a triangular pixel with my red, green, and my blue that I need to make white, right? And you know, here's another one. But the problem is that in order to make another pixel that's right in line with this one, I can't go way over here. I'm missing an entire row. Oh, wait. Okay. No, I see it. We can have a triangle here, and then we can have a triangle here, and one here, and one here, and they're kind of offset. And if we look closely at the surface of the display, it's got almost like these denim lines running through it. So that makes sense. Our subpixel layout is these nested triangles. Is what I would tell myself, good job Linus, if it wasn't for the fact that these are not subpixels. Every pixel on this 3200 by 1800 display is either red, green, or blue. To show you how this pans out in the real world, we made this test image that is a 3200 by 1800 checkerboard pattern. Now every other pixel should be black and every other pixel should be A color. I mean if you look at the display it's kind of gray so in a sense this red green and blue are making white-ish but how do they advertise this thing as 3200 by 1800? Well my friends because even though not every one of our pixels can impact hue every one of our pixels does impact the brightness and saturation of that square and the overall sharpness, which is why we need to stop using the word resolution to describe pixel count, but that's a lecture for another day. Let's play with this thing. Let's try zooming in to see how this thing is gonna handle larger checkerboard. Oh, that is cool. You can actually watch the transitions. You can see the particles. As they sloooowly darken, or brighten. Let's see what happens when I move my cursor across it. Do-do-do-do-oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, how you doing there, buddy? There's the little fingies on the hand icon! As you can probably imagine, though, on a display that can only sort of produce white, gray introduces some unique challenges. Let's go ahead and have a look at the no-signal screen. Oh, wow! Those are not supposed to look like that, are they? So, it's trash then? Well, not quite. So far everything we've done has been weird test patterns. What about real-world usage? Well, the first thing I notice about it is that we still have the same issue as last time, where you're gonna see the ghost of whatever it is you were doing last on top of any new content, unless you clear the display and do a slow refresh. Okay, drawing in green. It's like kind of greenish. I can see every single pixel with the naked eye. That is not something I'm used to. This is an LG HDR test video that you guys can go watch on your own if you want to have some idea of what it's supposed to look like. To be fair, this is like the worst case scenario for this monitor. The ghosting on black is way worse than when it's ghosting on white. It's not for watching video, but how does it compare to the non- color one? Do we have the old? Oh, we have the old one? It's right here. You know what? I think the ghosting is better on the new one. Oh, yeah. I mean, that's something, at least. Let's see how they hold up in video, though. So we'll do the classic clear, and then I'm going to go ahead and start our giant movie CD laser disk. Before we do that, we should make sure these are in the same mode. These have five different speeds that they can refresh at. We got fast, fast plus, fast plus plus, fast plus plus plus, and fast plus plus plus plus. Right. Okay. Video mode, with both of them fast plus plus plus plus. I don't know how much I need the color. I was about to say, I really appreciate having the color. Well, I mean, like look here, like you just have these like weird specks of green, like nothing's really filled in, it's all sporadic, and I feel like it looks a lot smoother with the gray. Yeah, but that shot didn't have a lot of color in it. So you weren't really getting that benefit. At least this plant is green. Like look, look here. Oh, at least I can appreciate the, you know, the glinting light off of this laser disc. What even is that? But did you notice that the front light is on? No, I mean, does that matter? Wait, this one doesn't have the light on at all. Okay. Compared to our black and white display, the color filter ends up wasting a ton of light, which defeats the purpose, kind of? 'Cause the point of E Ink, right, is it's supposed to be more like the experience of reading off of a piece of paper with natural ambient light. And on the original black and white one, we can totally do that. The brightness of this to my eye is actually comparable to this one with the front light activated. And we found that so much light was lost that we almost always preferred to have the front light on. You guys can see just how dim it is with it powered off. But maybe there's a use case where it's still worth the trade-off. Let's take a look at word processing and document creation. Oh, this is even great because we have highlights and stuff in here. Yeah, like that's... Ooh, really bad. Oh, goodness. It's really not sharp. Even with a clear, that looks like ass. What if we try changing the mode? Okay, sure. I mean, I should put this one in text mode too, then. Text mode is very, very, very aggressive with... Oh, you want it black. Like look at this, it's blue, let's go up one level. Oh no, that's black now. The sharpness is okay now, but I would never edit text at this size. No. Like I'd be working probably more like this. I think I would rather have my gray lighting over here than this highlighting over here with this low resolution text. Let's say I was willing to accept those compromises though, how usable is this? Let's take this document from roasting celeb and creator gaming setups. And try and make some edits to it. I just hold on. I'm just trying to fix the formatting here Okay, what is happening right now? That's the page break. There's a page break. I can't even see it here You can totally see it on this one. Yeah, but to be fair we are in text mode. Yeah text mode look No, no, no, no if text mode Is not what you need for editing a text document then they'd know. There you go. I just changed the contrast Okay, the rest of it you didn't finagle. I can barely even read this now. You should have finagled more Well, that's okay Now you can press your page break and then you can go like this and change your mode so that it's back to be better, you know there Also, this is supposed to be yellow. Mm-hmm. You wanted me to try to game on this thing Oh, yeah, we're gonna game on this thing, but let's you know what let's do what color e-ink does best Let's look at some comics. Yes I could see that being a legitimate use case for this That's not that great Linus although I tell you about finagling. I'm working on you gotta finagle. I'm working on it. Oh, oh Graphic mode not bad. We can get the other one on this one's also messed up now, so I'm gonna Come around and give this its best shot. If I'm reading text sharpness is everything Yep, and that's way sharper way way sharper on the black and white maybe a newspaper comic strip isn't the best Comparison because I was like what am I really losing in black and white here? But that's because it was smartly designed to not always be printed in color, but that's most comics Here's where I think it actually is probably the best case scenario for it Is this older watchman comic and I think it does look really great it benefits from the incredible coloring of the watchman series And it does get that dot printed cheap dot printed feeling Really well. It nails. Yes, but when you're not looking at cheap dot printed stuff It's just disappointing especially compared to like I don't know any other Display in its price bracket, but let's game in a minute. First I want to talk about the folks who might be considering a display like this in spite of all the obvious downsides and Those are people who are suffering from digital eye strain aka computer vision syndrome now I won't dispute the perceived improved comfort of using an E-ink display but it should be noted that there is still a lack of scientific evidence to demonstrate that blue light or any light emitted from a Display is bad for your eyes and while some of it might be down to poor translation Dasung makes a lot of broad medical claims that they probably haven't tested So if you're someone who suffers from digital eye strain rather than just taking what they're saying at face value Try following the 20/20/20 rule and make a point of remembering to blink If you have trouble with that, keep some saline eye drops at your desk in order to improve your hydration Of course, don't take advice about your eyes from either monitor manufacturers or YouTubers And if you have a persistent problem, make sure you talk to a professional Alright, enough boring medical stuff, let's game Super Meat Boy Challenge Dasung Black and White vs Dasung Color vs Alienware 240 Hertz OLED and you may be wondering. Hey, what's up with that? That seems unfair. It's the same price Well, actually mine's four hundred dollars cheaper Are those the speakers built into this monitor? Yeah, they are not very good. And this is Sammy If you guys lose this and you blame your hardware, that's uh, that's kind of embarrassed. I've never played this one moment Please I'd like to tweak my monitor a little bit. Yes, Sammy. You can also change your settings if you'd like Oh look at that Get that fine-tuning. Okay, so we're just gonna go we're gonna go to the first level so if they get they have to save the lady Okay done Nice, and then just mash 8 against the next level. You can wall jump by like slamming against things. Oh, I can't even see myself Oh, I got a wall here. Are you on the slope? Are you on the- what is- Oh my god. Oi oi oi! How far are we expected to go here? I think someone set a timer for a minute Wait wait wait. Oh, well that wasn't very good. I didn't- I can't see anything. It's all gray. How do I change the refresh rate again? M+? Yeah Yeah, I think so. Okay, you know fast plus plus plus. Dude, I can't I can't see for oh hold on Okay, I turn my contrast down. This is definitely better. Where are you Linus? Don't worry about it. Okay. I'm going this is going way More better now that I can actually see any of what I'm doing. I actually beat Linus. Be embarrassing, right? Yeah, you're not gonna beat me. Five, four, three, two, one. Three, two, one. Alright. No! I'm at 1-12. I'm at 1-9. I don't know what I'm at. You almost were there. 1-11. 1-11. So I was at 1-10. So clearly that's proof that color does improve your gaming performance. Yeah, not just that, but once I was able to tune it, the limited ghosting compared to the first gen one is definitely better. Like this is... very usable compared to what poor Sammy was dealing with over there. With that said, I'm not getting much of the benefit of the color- ness of it at this point. No. Wow! Now that I look at that... - It looks so much better. Of course, no one is buying this thing for gaming, and if you are the sort of person who has a use case that can benefit from it, you know who you are. Say, for example, if what you do is review documentation all day for a living... something like this could be worth the investment. And investment it will be. The color paper-like is worth about 1,650 US dollars, which somehow is less than Dasung's equivalent non-color E-Ink monitor. But with the trade-offs that are inherent to the technology, I can see how they would view these two displays as equal, if not the same. I guess the question now is... Color e-ink, it's definitely a thing. So why hasn't Amazon released a color e-reader yet? With the Kindle brand recognition that they have, they could charge a fortune for a color version. But if I had to guess, I'd say it probably comes down to the lack of brightness and the poor performance in both black and white and especially grayscale. So for the time being, you'll have to turn to competitors like Kobo, who we'll have linked in the video description, along with Dasung, if you're the sort of person to whom this is appealing, and... our sponsor, War Thunder!

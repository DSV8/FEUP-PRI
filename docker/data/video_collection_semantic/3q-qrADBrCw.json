    "transcript": "- Yo guys, Jonathan here and when Tim Cook took the stage today and said this was gonna be the best and biggest WWDC ever I think he was telling the truth. There was so much stuff announced today that if you're gonna buy one of each product on Apple's website with that shiny, attractive new tag, you'd be dropping $34,547, and let me break that down. So, we are seconds into the video and I've already made a terrible mistake. I forgot all about the brand new Apple Magic Keyboard with number pad and that's gonna tack on an additional 129 bucks which brings us to a grand total of 34,676 bucks. So, I'm gonna start with the two products that a, look most interesting to me, and b, aren't available til later this year. This is the brand new HomePod speaker and the oh my God that looks amazing iMac Pro. Now, the HomePod is actually that rumored Siri speaker that we've been hearing about and not gonna lie, HomePod doesn't exactly roll off the tongue. Honestly at this point Siri Speaker might have been a better name because HomePod is almost like they were high Sierra as they were naming it. What can tell you about the HomePod though is it kind of looks like a Mac Pro Mini covered in fabric. I was not allowed to touch it, I was not allowed to listen to it but for your reference here is how it looks stacked up next to an iPhone 7 Plus. There was a ton of talk and hype surrounding the HomePod mainly around it's Siri capabilities and the tech inside it. It's actually packing Apple's A8 chip which is kind of crazy for a speaker but ultimately it comes down to how does the speaker sound because if it sounds bad, none of those cool features matter. At the very least though, I am super curious to actually get my hands on one. So, next up is the insane iMac Pro and no, that is not a mistake. The iMac Pro is a real thing. These start at 4,999 and beyond the super attractive space grade finish, there's actually some serious power packed inside. For starters, out of the box this comes with an eight-core Intel Zeon processor but you can configure it up to 18 cores, and I'm not sure I thought I would ever say 18 cores and iMac in the same sentence. As far as graphics go, these are packing AMD's Vega GPUs and can be configured up to 16 gigabytes of VRAM which is kind of crazy for an iMac. You can also configure these up to 128 gigabytes of RAM which is also kind of nuts and even though this is more of a WWDC video I did get to spend some time with the iMac Pro, so if you guys want to see a dedicated video on that, let me know by dropping a like below. Moving down the list there were two new iPad Pros today, a completely brand new 10.5-inch iPad Pro that replaces the 9.7-inch model and a much needed update to the 12.9-inch model. These come in at 649 and 799. Now, there's some pretty serious power packed inside these iPad Pros. Both of them come equipped with Apple's A10X chip. That's a 6-core CPU 12-core GPU and then you pair that with all the iOS 11 updates specific to the iPad Pro and those look pretty attractive. Now from there there are updates to pretty much every single MacBook across the board starting with the 12-inch MacBook. There's a 1.2 gigahertz, 256 gigabyte model for 1,299 and then a 1.3 gigahertz, 512 gigabyte model for 1,599. Now, as far as the MacBook Pro starting with the 13-inch model, there are four brand new stock configurations. There is a 2.3 gigahertz, 128 gigabyte model but no touch bar for 1,299, and then you can double the storage on that for 1,499. Jumping over to the touch bar 13-inch MacBook Pro is you can pick up a 3.1 gigahertz, 256 gigabyte model for 1,799 or you can double that storage for 1,999. Now, moving on to its bigger brother, the 15-inch MacBook Pro, there are two stock configurations there, a 2.8 gigahertz, 256 gigabyte model for 2,399 or a 2.9 gigahertz, 512 gigabyte model for 2,799. So, clearly there is so much to talk about there that I had to get up out of there and move to a different location but touching upon those MacBook Pros for a second, they're pretty much solely just a Kaby Lake spec bump and nothing more. If you were holding out for a 32 gigabyte RAM option upgrade that did not happen but I guess the good news is if you just bought a MacBook Pro or you own a 2016 model there really isn't a huge reason to upgrade. So, moving on from the MacBook Pro's both the 21.5 inch and 27 inch, iMac's go updates across the board. The 21.5 inch iMac starts out at 1,099 and it's gonna get you a 2.3 gigahertz processor, a one terabyte hard drive, integrated graphics and a 1080P display. Now, if you want to jump up to a Retina 4K iMac those start at 1,299. That's gonna get you a 3.0 gigahertz processor, a one terabyte hard drive but this time you get a bump up to Radeon Pro 555 dedicated graphics. Now, for 1,499 this is gonna be your best bang for your buck as far as the 21 and a half inch iMac goes. That's gonna get you a 3.4 gigahertz processor, a one terabyte fusion drive, something the prior two iMacs don't have and you can jump all the way up to Radeon Pro 560 graphics. Jumping over to the 27-inch 5K iMac, those start at 1,799. That's gonna get you a 3.4 gigahertz processor, a one terabyte fusion drive and Radeon Pro 570 graphics. Now, for 200 bucks more you're gonna get a slightly faster CPU but more importantly you're gonna bump up to Radeon Pro 575 graphics, and lastly, for 2,299 that's gonna get you a 3.8 gigahertz processor, a two terabyte fusion drive but the kicker here is you're getting Radeon Pro 580 graphics with a crazy eight gigabytes of VRAM. Now, if you do want to max this iMac out it's gonna run you 5,299 which puts you directly in iMac Pro pricing. Maybe that kind of puts things in perspective as far as that goes. Now, if we stop there and we were just talking about hardware, that would put us at a grand total of 31,482 bucks but we're not done. Apple dropped a crap load of new accessories. This is gonna be a mouthful but there are eight brand new Apple watches at 49 bucks a pop, five brand new iPhone Seven cases, three of the silicone being 35 and two with the leather being 45. Double that for the iPhone Seven Plus cases but add four dollars onto each of those prices, and then from there there are a ton of iPad Pro accessories starting with the Apple pencil case. Those are 29 bucks a pop, at four different color options. That brings us to a grand total of 116 bucks. Four leather sleeve options for the 10.5-inch iPad Pro is 516 bucks, seven 10.5-inch iPad Pro smart covers is 343 bucks, four leather smart covers for the 10.5-inch iPad Pro equals 270 bucks, the brand new 10.5-inch iPad Pro smart keyboard is 159 bucks. We then of course have the brand new 12.9-inch iPad Pro as well. There are three leather sleeve options for that totaling 447 bucks, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro smart keyboard is 169 bucks, the three leather smart cover options for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro are 237 bucks, and lastly, that brand new Apple Magic Keyboard with number pad is another 129 bucks which brings us to a grand total of 34,676 bucks. Also, if you were curious about iOS 11 coverage make sure you check out Miss Krystal Key, she's got you covered there. Just dropped a brand new Dream Desk as well which I am super proud of. Thank you guys for watching and I will catch you guys later.",

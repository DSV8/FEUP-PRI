    "transcript": "- Now I know that tech news can be scary, but courage is not the absence of fear. Blah-blah, take my hand and we'll be scared together. - [Director] Very loud, Linus. - Microsoft just became a developer of PlayStation games. The company is buying Zenimax media, the parent company of Bethesda, Arkane Studios and Id Software, for $7.5 billion in cash. This means that \"Fallout\", \"The Elder Scrolls\", \"Dishonored\", \"Quake\", \"Doom\" and more are all going to become Microsoft properties. Even more interestingly, it means Microsoft now owns the developers behind a pair of PlayStation Five exclusives, \"Deathloop\" and \"Ghostwire Tokyo\". Strangely, this isn't even that out of character for Microsoft as of late. The company just doesn't seem to give a (bleep) about whether gamers use their products on Xbox or their products somewhere else. I just hope there won't be some software lock in \"Skyrim\" that will prevent us from running that wheel of cheese benchmark. - [Director] I don't know what that is. - TikTok and WeChat have both gotten stays of execution from the US government. They were supposed to have both been removed from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store on Sunday, but at the last second, Walmart of all people entered the deal between TikTok and Oracle, making it, by President Trump's decree, American enough, I guess. As for WeChat, they got a ruling from a federal judge in the District of California keeping them on life support until at least next Sunday, until they can get this all sorted out. Y'know the weirdest thing about all of this is that Bytedance is still gonna own, what, 80% of TikTok? So like, that's American enough. Maybe it's just too big to fail. It's all the rage, all the kids are \"Dude, yeah, just gotta sing, y'know.\" - [Director] Dancing is popular, man. - Even though bots were likely at least partially responsible for the PlayStation Five pre-order fiasco, Sony has actually come out with a mea culpa, noting that the whole thing could have been a lot smoother. That's putting it mildly. Similarly to Nvidia and their short supply of RTX 3080s, Sony is promising that more consoles will be available very soon, if only we had an exact date to specify for you, we don't. The company also promised that more would be available through the end of the year. So if you were hoping to have one under your Christmas tree, don't give up. Or maybe give up, - Or get an Xbox! - 'cuz Amazon has already told folks who have pre-ordered that they may not get their console on release day, which is scheduled for November the 12th. I mean, I suppose you could always go fight for one in person on Black Friday, but given how high demand is, you might not have much luck unless you happen to be Conor McGregor. Now it's time for Quick Bits, brought to you by \"War Thunder\", the free to play online military vehicle combat game. Play on Windows, Mac, Linux, PS4 and Xbox One with cross play and more than 20 million players worldwide. You can pilot an incredible arsenal of more than 1,500 historically-accurate tanks, aircraft and ships in massive combined arms battles on over 80 major battlefields, from World War Two to the end of the Cold War. You've never blowed stuff up like this before. You can also expect major free updates every couple months, adding more vehicles maps and gameplay features. So start playing \"War Thunder\" for free, and you'll also get some bonus items for signing up. So click the link below to check it out. Onto the Bit Quicks! The slap fight between Epic Games and Apple rages on, as Epic is none too happy about Apple claiming that the lawsuit was just a tactic to get people more interested in \"Fortnite\" on iOS. And Apple claims that people just, well, they ain't that into \"Fortnite\" anymore. So Epic has countered by saying that the number of \"Fortnite\" players has actually gone up by nearly 40% between October and July. So somebody isn't telling the truth in court. You know, I've never seen that before. - [Director] But, you swear on a Bible! - Here's some good news if you're looking forward to \"Cyberpunk 2077\" but also missed out on the RTX 3080. It turns out the minimum and recommended system requirements have just dropped, and they dropped before they even dropped! They're not super demanding! - [Director] Before you could drop them! - All they're asking for is an AMD FX 8310, pfft, and a GTX 780, while recommending a Ryzen 3 3200 and a GTX 1060. So you won't need a computer with the power of \"The Matrix\" for a virtual dose of Keanu. Isn't that wonderful? - [Director] He's not gonna look good though. - Sad news out of Germany, as it appears that a patient at Dusseldorf-- Actually, it's Dusseldorf. University Hospital has died as the result of a ransomware attack, wow, really? Earlier this month network problems caused by the attack forced workers to transfer the patient to a more distant hospital. Although the hackers apparently did not mean to target the hospital and reportedly provided the key for free after they realized what happened, they could still be hit with negligent homicide charges. Yeah, for real, that's great. There's also speculation that this is the first time that ransomware has directly caused a death. Yeah, so, there you go, hackers. Y'know, the real world has real consequences, (bleep). Another Windows 10 update is on the horizon as next month we should be getting the 20H2 update. The most visible change will probably be the new start menu, which should look a little less busy, and the new Chromium-based version of the Edge browser is going to be pre-installed. You'll also see more options in the Settings app, as Microsoft continues to phase out the infinitely superior control panel, which has been around since Windows 1.0. I personally will be very sad to see it ride off into the sunset. - [Director] It deserves it, right? - And finally another electronics mainstay is being put out to pasture as Nintendo has announced it is no longer manufacturing the 3DS. - [Director] No! - It's obviously taken a backseat to the Switch, but the 3DS was a very successful console in its own right, selling over 75 million units over nine years. However, the good news is that you'll still be able to buy 3DS games through the eShop and play online for a long time to come, we hope. So don't sweat too much if you don't feel like paying a supply shortage premium for the Nintendo Switch. And that's our show! Come back on Wednesday for more tech news that we would never price gouge you for, 'cuz it's free. Unless you pay for YouTube Premium, or you buy shirts on LTTstore.com. It's not really free, is it? - [Director] The joy is free.",

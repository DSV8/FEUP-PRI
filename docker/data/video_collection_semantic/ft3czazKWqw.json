    "transcript": "- Hey it's Justine, and today I wanna show you guys this new app that just came out, it's called DoubleTake, it's by FiLMiC Pro. You guys may remember at the iPhone 11 Keynote, a FiLMiC Pro was out on stage, talking about how they were gonna be integrating this feature into FiLMiC Pro. - [Narrator] But now, you can shoot with multiple cameras at the same time. [Justine]- Instead of integrating it into their already paid app, they came out with an entirely brand new app and that's called DoubleTake. So I'm gonna show you guys the app, I have it running right now. We're gonna go through some of these settings, and I'll show you guys exactly how this works. So when you click down here on this little lens button, this will take you into all four camera options. So you guys can see you have the ultra wide, the wide, the telephoto, and of course, the selfie. So for this I'm gonna choose the A Cam as my selfie, and the B Cam is the ultra wide. So you can also change your frame rate by clicking on the frame rates. You have 30, 24 and 25. We're gonna shoot in 24 because that's what I shoot most of my YouTube videos at. Let's click confirm, and that will take us into this little setting right here. So this is where the fun really starts, because you've got a couple of options here. So up here in the top right, and so when you click that you can go through all the things that you can record at the same time. You have split screen, you also have discreet, which I love this a lot because it records both camera streams, and you can separately export those, so they won't be burned in like this Picture in picture option. So with picture in picture, that is basically what you're gonna get, you can be editing on the fly. So we're gonna start with picture in picture, so when you hit record, this records your entire screen, so right now, you guys will be seeing me move around this ultra wide screen right here, and that's happening live, on this app. You can also get rid of it. It's gone. Click right here this little arrow, it'll be back. If you want to enlarge that second camera you can. And if you wanna go back to it, there I am! And you're doing this all live on the fly. So you just scoot that right over to the side, it's gone, I'm on screen, you want that to come back, click this little button, it's back. You wanna just full screen this, you can. This is live switching and editing, on the fly, it's pretty cool. Next is split screen. I love this, I actually tested this out with my sister, we were at a Super73 launch event. I was in the front facing and she was in the back, so we were basically having a conversation in split screen just like this. Yeah, there's some things that have happened, so right now we're filming in split screen mode. What's really cool about this is I'm over here, Jenna's over here, Jenna come back over. So here's my hand, and now Jenna's here. - Whoa, it's magic! - I'm gonna change the camera angle really quickly here, so this B Camera, I'm gonna do a telephoto. Now this I'm gonna be zoomed in on my little monitor. So here, we have the split screen, I'm over here on the selfie cam and in the telephoto is my Atomos Ninja Five. Second camera, where are you? You're right there. We're not using you right now, but you're there. You can also flip it, and you can shoot vertical! Here's a vertical option, I'm in the selfie cam. The Ninja is also in it. This is cool, this is gonna be so great for Instagram stories. So now we're recording discreetly. This is using both camera angles, and these are shooting separately. I can use the selfie cam, or I can flip to the front. So, here's my hand, it's going to the front. Hand, front, hand, front. So if you guys can tell, since these are recorded separately, things like concerts, or events, you can be filming your reaction, but also filming the action in front of you. So now that you've shot all this incredible content, where does it go? So in here, there's a little, looks like an SD card, this will bring up all of the shots that you've recorded. So if you want to select them all, you just click that little check box, and these will all be saved directly to your camera roll. So when we go to the camera roll, here's the picture in picture that we shot. Here's the split screen. Here's the split screen vertical. And, of course, here's the discreet. There's the other camera angle of discreet. So this app is really fun, I'm excited to try this out a little bit further. To be able to do that just on this phone is pretty awesome. It does only record 1080p, I thought that it might record 4k, but still the fact that you're able to record both of those streams, and most of the time the 1080p and the 4k versions of these videos, usually things on YouTube you can't tell the difference. But usually I do like to have everything shot in 4k, but this is gonna be really cool, and I'm excited to see the fun things that I can do with this, especially for Instagram stories or TikTok, or now even the new Byte app! If you guys are on Byte, make sure you guys follow me, hopefully by this time I got my username back. But if I didn't, my username is ijustinereal. So that's really me. I'd love to hear what you guys think of this app, and I'd love to see some of the things that you guys shoot with it. Feel free to tweet me any of your video creations that you guys make with it. Hopefully I'll see some of you guys at Vlog University this weekend, it's gonna be so much fun, it'll be here before we know it! I'm gonna go and prep for the event this weekend. Okay, bye.

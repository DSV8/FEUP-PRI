    "transcript": "previously i i've looked at some of the security stuff um like uh security plus and like the books and some of the materials out there and it's like just concept of the concept of the concept it's like after like an hour of that you you like sport out of your mind so i'm really glad to hear what you've done yeah you know that came from me having the exact same experience as that going i cannot stay engaged with this this point death by pub man we've all been there and we've all had to come back from the brink of like going oh i i'm ready to just toss in the towel this is this is not fun it's terrible yeah right why why why can't it be fun why can't it be hey run over to vulnhub grab this vulnerable machine and let's do this stuff that we're talking about here okay so i want to interrupt you right now sorry because you've mentioned vulnhub so i i've heard a lot of guys talk about hack the box uh try hackney can you explain bowling hub and how it's different or better or sure you know what how does it compare to the to the other two which teams tend to be more well-known yeah so uh vulnhub has taken the idea of let's create a of an environment that is purposefully flawed uh a ctf right a capture this is the the general term that we use for this ctf it's basically just a hacking puzzle and make it instead of an online experience where you use a vpn or you come in through a web portal and instead of that you use your own local virtualization or maybe you have like an extra machine and you drop that on there you spin it up you connect it with a network connectivity of some way shape or form and you hack at it you go for broke you try to get what you can get and see if you can solve the puzzle so it's it's actually different to hack the box yeah so it is different to hack the box but not by a ton um hack the box you're running it locally is that right you're running it right hack the box is going to be up in the cloud you get a a vpn connectivity pack you download that you run open vpn you gain connectivity and then you start connecting up in the cloud which is good because then it kind of gives you that more of a of a real world experience right that idea that this is in the internet and it's not sitting here on my local network not a huge deal one way or the other honestly but it does kind of give you some some difference uh you gotta be able to work with that technology where this is gonna be local virtualization i download a virtual appliance i import it into my virtualization technology and honestly you need to be running multiple different virtualization technologies because some of these are all like user created people that are just passionate about industry right okay uh some of them are created by professionals that that do this and have done ctfs and they're all really cool all the stuff like from pentester lab they make some great ctf stuff that's on vault hub highly recommend that stuff um some of them are built to be kind of like um what's the word like um hacking gymnasiums where hey we've got a lot of the typical attack vectors that you're going to see in real life land in here so now you can if you're learning about sql injection there's going to be a sql injection here you just got to find it if you can find it how far can you exploit it so you get to flex those muscles build them up build those skill sets up using these things and then of course some of them are very gamified puzzle like story driven which i kind of really like because it kind of gives it that context that a lot of this can be missing context can be key as far as learning goes to make things stick in your brain have higher retention of those concepts if there's a good context wrapped around it that is something i also try to do in my my one off my my um what i call hands-on series that i created which was let's use context a story to make this more understandable and solidify those concepts that we are attempting to use so that when i build a methodology i have multiple ways in which i have used my skills to go this generally seems to be the right way to to go and every now and then i gotta deviate from the norm and and reach into my uh what do they say go beyond my comfort zone and and try to do some googling or whatever and then okay now i've got a new set of skills and it's tied to something you were doing again you're gonna get a higher retention rate like that so i like to take those certifications build up as much applicable uh content as possible and then on top of that creates this is all practical so whatever you're doing and then come back using things like in my hands on hacking series i grab a ton of uh vms from vault hub and we use those as our as our story right do we use those as well i'm glad you i'm glad you're talking about that so now i'm going to put you back on your island yeah yeah sorry so you've you've got like hack the box try hack me vol hub i don't know if there are any others that you like but you know can you mention if there are any others that you like and then give me the one that gets you off the island so which is your which is your favorite if you're starting out and which is like your favorite if you like more advanced in your career so i would say if you're starting out something like try hack me is probably the best because they are a really great blend of holding your hand and you know your dad teaching you how to ride a bike without your training wheels right yeah they're holding on to you they're showing you exactly where to go and then next thing you know where did dad go he's gone and you're doing it all by yourself so that's great they have a great model of pushing you from i don't i really know what i'm doing i need some help to i've got some skills i'm just going to go after some of these challenges and try to be challenged and see if i'm able to push myself beyond my comfort level and and grow that's right so i think that's a great way hack the box can be it's it's it's probably the more difficult and it seems frustrating because they're kind of like forcing you to you know beat your head against a a wall until you you get it right yeah they they kind of take that oscp mentality of just try harder try harder yeah which which i i mean you and i have both been in training for many years it's it's okay to do that at some point but you know if you're just starting out you you know you've got to at least like i like the idea of mentoring or showing a path you know you know just follow me i'm not going to spoon feed you in the beginning i have to right but i mean i don't if you agree with that but i mean that that like sort of like taking a longer path seems a better a better you know take me like you said the analogy with the father and the training wheels when you're learning to ride a bicycle yeah i think that that that's a better way in for especially if you just if you knew sorry to interrupt go on i i appreciate the try hat that try hug me the try harder philosophy up up to the point to where it becomes useless right so there are there going to be those times where let's say i'm trying to drive a nail into a board and i'm like this is just not going and i come over to a master carpenter and say this nail will not drive in and he goes just try harder so i go back and i hit harder and i hit harder and it's still not going and they go you just got to keep trying harder what they need to do is go you're using a spoon to try to drive a nail into a board you should try a hammer i like that great great analogy right like that that would be better that that's better information that's more helpful then try harder can be helpful but every now and then it would be nice for someone to go oh you're probably just not aware of this you've just missed the boat on that and i assumed you knew it let me fix that here you go here's what you need to know about that now try try hack me takes you along that path sorry is that right yeah try hack me takes you along the let me let me get you up to speed and then as you gain skills of course it's all gamified badges cool stuff everybody loves it because it's fun right it's a lot of great stuff it's a good platform it works well you can go through that you know html5 browser experience and you know you don't have to spin anything up you just log in and go or if you have your own if you're running kali or parrot or whatever and a windows box or something you can just vpn in and gain access that way so whatever your pleasure i like having options i'm that kind of person so i'm a linux person give me options let me do it my way and not tell me this is how you're supposed to do it apple um hey i like apple no no i'm kidding it no i think you're right i mean it's and so vol hub is more than is further down the road that's for like you like more of a more experienced person is that right actually it's it's kind of a blending of the two so because they are user created it's not like an entity by the way vulnerable has been purchased or acquired is the right terminology by offensive security and now they have taken that platform fallen hub's still free still cool they have their own platform now called the proving grounds i haven't had a chance to get into that yet i totally want to check that out but it's great that there's another option yeah right and again i go back to this it's babette's feast for red teamers at this point to play around i mean you've got juice shop from owasp you've got pentester lab you've got just tons of platforms out there for people to play around with uh what is it uh web goats and web wolf uh tons of uh be box and web sploit you've got multiliday you've got dvwa there's just so many things for you to be able to get out there and actually try to put some wheels on your security skills and use them and see you know you ever be in math class when you're in school and it just made so much sense when the teacher was sitting there explaining it to you and then you got home and you tried to do your homework you're like i am dumb i i do not understand this apparently why was it easy then and now it's not easy now that's what we that's that's kind of what we want to be able to do and that bonehub and all these other things are going to be your homework learn the thing and then go try to apply the thing and see if you're able to do it successfully and there's going to be varying levels of that they do show that in vulnerable where someone will label oh this is an easy box or this is a medium difficulty or intermediate difficulty or this is hard that's a bit subjective with them they don't have a standard for what that looks like that's just based off of their own estimation of that sometimes i download an easy box i'm like who the heck thought this was easy that's the problem and i mean that's why i think your your advantage sorry your your recommendation of try hack me is it's the same thing with cisco labs you know it's um if it's user created it's you know it could be all over the place and and that that gets me to this thing sorry to jump around um daniel but i've had this i had this question quite a few times um do you need to get ccna before you go into hacking um ethical hacking or are there any other prerequisite skills that you get because some people i've see it's this whole try harder mentality i've seen on some of the comments on my youtube videos where someone who's very new will ask a question and it's a newbie question but if you're brand new you ask those kind of questions and someone else will exactly and then someone will just slam them um and i don't think that really helps anyone so you know absolutely right i like i hate to see that i i don't see that as often as i used to thank goodness because i think a lot of the people that went through that for for whatever reason like you know the hazing mentality was kind of a was a a tradition so i remember when i you know started that's what really was a big barrier to me when i first got interested in security many moons ago that you know you ask a question someone goes stupid noob rtfm and and that helps no one all right okay and then you you get discouraged and you you give up and you do other things because you eventually you've got to make a living you've got to do something that you can do to to earn money to support yourself so that's what i ended up doing and then when it came when i came back around to it and now i'm seeing a community of just phenomenal people understanding that don't be the jerk right because nobody here likes the jerk and if you are the jerk we're gonna call you out and no one no one's gonna no one's gonna play with you until you decide hey i'm not i guess maybe i'm not being too cool and and that's good right we we don't want you to come in everybody wants to share knowledge nobody wants to keep i mean there are definite like secret sauce things that kind of people keep to themselves as a you know maybe i've got a zero day in my pocket or something like that that can be beneficial to me as a professional in my work but you know you see so many people just giving out information hey learn from me it's just beggars trying to show other beggars where to get bread all the time and i love that that i can go out there we all it's like you said we all started at zero right we all started at zero and i'm gonna tell you right now it doesn't matter how hot you are there's something out there you don't know about yet exactly there's something coming that hasn't even been invented yet that you're gonna need to learn exactly and so we're all in the same boat in some way shape or form we just need to support each other there's plenty of opportunity for everybody to have work so let's let's share the wealth right let's let's have a good time so i mean sorry daniel to get back do you need to have ccna so my original question just to just to to rephrase it yeah are they is there prerequisite knowledge to get into this field or can what level of knowledge is required is it ccna is it network plus is it you know what do i need to get into this field or is there no barrier yeah so i'm taking your question to mean like i i want to be a security person do i need to start at ground zero um i hate to keep telling you this but it does absolutely depend on what your skill level already is if you already know the basics about operating systems you've got a home network going you administer you've built your own firewall you've you know you've employed maybe some like dns solution you're using encryption you're you're playing around things you've got some experience you maybe you don't need that formalized end of thing i never got security plus right i just i kind of skipped that step and and that's fine does that mean i i would never go get a security post absolutely not i get security plus today if somebody handed me a voucher and said go take over heck yeah i'm gonna go grab that put that on my resume it looks good shows that i'm staying current i'm doing things as far as your prerequisite knowledge base this is really the question right yeah like yeah i mean it's hard i know it's hard to quantify it but yeah you know i get some people that think you must go down this crazy long journey like i must become a ccie before i can become a like a pen tester which is ridiculous but now how far do i go through like networking operating system linux you know where do you just decide to go for it so i i've met hackers who are making you know half a million dollars a year and they never had any formalized training ever they have no search they have nothing and they're busting big money right yeah it is absolutely possible for you to do this is it probable is the question probably not right there's a reason we have these formalized steps because if i want to take the analogy and i want to shift it to a different field let's say you want to be an airline pilot can i just get in a plane start pulling knobs and buttons and and hopefully i find myself on the air and then hopefully i find myself on the ground in a way that i enjoy you know and not not enjoy because i'm crashed and not alive anymore you know this why put the cart before the horse why do it in a way that's opposite rarely do you find a person that can work really well that way it does happen but that's not the norm the norm is is there is a you need to understand about operating systems you need to understand about servers and services and networking and how that stuff works and what's going on because you need to understand the basics of how they're supposed to work then you need to understand the basics of what happens when they don't work and how you fix that right that is going to be a major part now does that mean you gotta go get a ccna or whatever that could mean that like if that's the way you got that knowledge that's fine if it was just through a bunch of trial and error and you're building labs and and playing around with stuff and or maybe you got dropped into a position at your job because they said oh you know about computers huh well guess what you're now the network guy enjoy don't kill us you know do a good job and you're just kind of learning on the job that could be it too but there is typically that foundational body of knowledge of i need to know about operating systems i need to know about servers i need to know about services i need to know about networking i need to understand a bit probably about basic security principles i highly recommend highly recommend understanding uh scripting programming especially if you're saying i want to be a pen tester i want to are you talking about like bash or are you talking about yes uh powershell yes or python yes uh but you're not talking about like ceo stuff like that yeah no all of the above everything right so ultimately boils down to what i what i really mean is pick something whether it be bash python c doesn't matter pick one learn how to do it at least fundamentally where you can write a program and it runs and it works you can do the basic functionality of whatever language you're using these are conditional you know statements like ifs uh loops uh working with arithmetic working with creating network connectivity with a program how do i create a socket connection just those basic fundamental things and now it's just learning the language from bouncing from one to the other you're gonna get proficient at one and then you're gonna start applying it because if i'm looking at an exploit that doesn't work because they a lot of exploits that you find on the internet as oh here's a download exploit for x y or z uh vulnerability it's probably not going to work out of the gate by design you need to have that that's to discourage script kitties they can't just download it compile it hit run or just run the script because it's a script you got to go in there and you got to make some modifications if you don't know how to make those modifications i.e script kitties you're not going to have an easy time at being a hacker because to me that's a fundamental thing and here's why not because i think that you need to be a developer to be a hacker is because understanding how programs are built and work gives you such an insight to the systems that you're going to be hacking on extremely beneficial if i don't know how php renders a page or how it works connected to a database and i'm looking at fill boxes and push buttons and that typically i see that in connection with maybe a mysql on the backend or a mongodb or whatever technology maybe it's running in flask and i gotta be aware of some python like these are standard technology javascript how does how does these web pages work how does this application work how do i fuzz it out to create an exploit how do i talk to it what's it doing underneath if it's using a standard set of of commands or language how do i work with that if you don't understand that can you still do it yeah but it's harder so understanding a programming scripting language then once i've gained access what if i have nothing at my at my ready to continue to keep that access and gain persistence other than doing like living off the land if i can't run powershell i'm gonna have a hard time making it do the stuff i want to do and still fly under the radar right so when i say learn how to do some of these things it's not necessary don't don't hear me say it's absolutely necessary but man is it extremely helpful super helpful in more ways than just i can make up a an exploit or whatever it gives me insight and understanding into how all these things work together and the technologies that tie and bind and how i can manipulate them because i understand the language underneath at least fundamentally you",

    "transcript": "this is the gigabyte aero 17 it's been almost seven months since I looked at an Aero laptop in fact the last one that I checked out was the Aero 15 OLED and I didn't have the best experience with that in terms of functionality and performance but that 4k display all the display was absolutely gorgeous it's it's still in my memory now this one over here comes to the new 10gen comet-like processor and in videos RTX Super Max acute graphics but most importantly I've got the 17 inch of variant here so I was naturally curious to see how we would cool the new hardware and of course compare it to intel's ninth gen coffee like CPU and invidious non super max Q graphics the standard one because if you think about it or if you recall both Intel and NVIDIA launched their CPUs and GPUs for notebooks at the exact same time so is this fresh Hardware gonna give us a noticeable improvement over last generation let's find out oh and by the way I am gonna be comparing this to a m-- DS 4900 HS the results are surprising time to pay some bills the X 299 CLX from asrock is the best place to house your new core X processor it features aluminum alloy heat sinks with dr. Mazda 13 face power design for the best overclocking experience it also has Wi-Fi six support 3m two slots along with reinforced PCI brackets learn more down below alright so I want to quickly go over the specs of the Aero 17 the model that I have over here comes with a new core i7 10 875 h8 core 16 thread CPU 16 gigabytes of dual channel memory running at 29 33 megahertz a 512 gig SSD and RT X 2070 Supermax acute GPU and a 4k display and the price you pay for all of that is $2,800 now that's what gigabyte told us but their official site says $2,900 so take that for what it is now of all the notebook brands that I've come across gigabyte is probably the only one offering a million SKUs of their Aero 15 and 17 inch notebooks so you can pick this up from $79 all the way up so a whomping 4300 USD the notebook itself hasn't changed all that much think of this as a super-sized Aero 15 with the same lid the same backlit logo honestly gigabyte hasn't changed anything on the outside the chassis for the most part is made out of CNC aluminum but it's not an all unibody design like the Razer Blade and the build quality is pretty good the hinges haven't stiffened up a bit one of my biggest issues with last year's model was the wobbly screen but I barely noticed that on this year's sample when you open up the laptop you're greeted with a full-size keyboard with pretty straightforward layout now don't mistake yourself thinking that this comes with front-facing speakers that's not the case they're just there for ventilation in fact the speakers are located at the bottom and they sound okay I mean there's no base there's a lot of treble it's not the best sounding laptop speakers that I've come across they haven't changed the sound signature compared to last generation so nothing new here the keyboard is really good the typing experience is way superior compared to my blade notebook this is basically a copy and paste from last year's assignment it's got good feedback the RGB elimination is really nice and bright but unfortunately it does not light up the function keys and that can be a bit frustrating in the dark I'm not a huge fan of the font choice plus the wast keys are bolded it just kills the simplicity or the continuity of the whole notebook in my opinion the trackpad is not that great it's not a glass surface like what you can find on the razor blade series or even the g14 from Asus so it's not as smooth to navigate around with honestly at this price point I am disappointed to see he could bite not improvise on this area because you can get a better experience with the competition I mean sure this come with Windows position drivers but having good software it doesn't necessarily mean a good experience if you have a really poor trackpad or something that doesn't meet up the standards especially since you're being close to $3,000 on a notebook the trackpad does come with a fingerprint reader so if that's something that you're looking into for added security you've got that but I do want to mention something very important and that is the edges of the Aero series laptops are way too sharp to type on especially when you're using it for general purposes the webcam is positioned at the worst possible location it stationary which means I can't if I need to reposition my friend I'd have to physically move a laptop and not the lid absolutely frustrating it seems like gigabyte is pretty adamant about their design choice here and honestly I don't get the point with a Besant less displace I mean what's wrong with having a little bit of space at the top - you know implement a camera it just makes no sense the microphone sounds okay I mean you know it's passable by honestly I wouldn't use this for business conference calls just because it's not your best angle is pointing at your nose and you don't want people looking at the earth and your nose for the most part so yeah it's I'm pretty frustrated honestly get goodbye like why now you may or may not have noticed coil 1 in that recording and the reason I say that is because during idle scenarios in some cases this notebook started to exhibit really bad coil whine I mean listen to this so yeah that's something to be aware of we did confirm with a few other creators who have the exact same sample they seem to experience the same issue too so this might turn out to be a known issue for the new aero notebooks but after speaking to gigabyte about this issue they did mention then you can exchange your RMA the notebook if you are experiencing the same thing the i/o is loaded on this notebook in fact it's one of my favorite things about the Aero series so on the right hand side there's power in HDMI 2.0 mini DisplayPort 1.4 Thunderbolt 3 a type a USB 3 point to Gen 1 switching over to the left you get an rj45 jack UHS 2 carburetor a couple more USB type a ports and audio jacks it's basically a content creators dream come true however I can't seem to wrap my head around gigabytes implementation of USB 3.2 gen 1 which is the flanking bits per second protocol versus Jen - that's tanking bits per second protocol because that was supported on kapolei CPUs so I'm not sure why they have not dated the i/o spec to that I mean my razor blade with the 9 CPU has that so it's kind of frustrating to say he could by not update the specs moving on to the display this is by far the best that I've encountered on a notebook guys heck even better the gaming monitor you see the model that I have here comes with a 4k resolution at 60 Hertz and it's pre calibrated by X right out of the factory and gigabyte claims up to a hundred percent Adobe RGB that's never heard of on a notebook at least I am an experienced one in the past now this thing surpassed our despite quality analysis tests with flying colors honestly I didn't even think about running the display tests in the first place because when I opened the laptop of the first time I was drooling all over it guys the colors are just beautiful with consistent contrast ratios at different brightness levels the screen gets really bright close to 500 nits so you can easily take this thing outdoors plus it's matte I mean what else can you ask for you can count on this display for some serious color work or even if a photographer this is what you should be looking into the 4k resolution scales really well in the Seventeen's form factor it's really really sharp I honestly can't complain about it at all now if you are thinking about gaming on a primarily I would step down to the 1080p 144 Hertz display because yes 4k is great for content creation but not necessarily for gaming so that's something to keep note of now in terms of upgradability you get instant access to two Ram slots and you can upgrade memory up to 64 gigabytes there are two MDOT two slots of which one of them is populated and it has really good read/write performance the battery on this thing is huge guys it's 94 hours which is a little less than the actual legal limit which is about ninety nine point nine one hours and it's really good on this laptop during our light load test we're entering a Chrome web page for 15 seconds our system lasted over seven hours during our heavy load test running real bench on a loop the system lasted for about an hour and 40 minutes finally let's get into performance now gigabyte has added various performance modes on the Aero 17 you can easily access them through their control center we ran all of our tests in the highest setting starting with synthetics the new 8 core 16 thread core i7 10 875 H is a good 35 to 40 percent faster than the 6 core 12 thread 9750 H now keep in mind I'm comparing this to the razor blade Pro which is another slim gaming laptop just like the Aero 17 whereas the Legion Y 740 was a brick running at crazy high clock speeds single core performance has improved and that kind of makes sense since this laptop didn't have a problem maintaining clock speeds at 4.5 to 4.8 gigahertz but under heavy multi-core workload clock speeds dipped all the way down to three to 3.2 gigahertz and the results we're well respectable but not great especially when compared to the horizon 9 4900 HS as you can see from a blender test it just can't quite keep up with AMD the same story applies to a handbrake test transcoding a video doc 4900 HS is wicked fast guides now about this way Noire tests a lot of this has to do with the SSD speeds along with single thread performance and Aero 17 does really well that why sun 40 from lenovo has one of the fastest SSDs and it's clocked really really high so that's why it takes the lead here moving on to adobe premiere this thing certainly favors Intel and that's thanks to quick sync but there is no difference whatsoever compared to the 97 th even with four extra threads on the new CPU I think this might be an optimization thing but if you really think about it it's the same architectures so yeah switching to DaVinci Resolve I think the r-tx 2070 super deserves the credit here since it's got more cores and this program loves GPUs so there's barely any effort put by the new Intel CPU gaming performance on the other hand was outstanding that new r-tx 2070 super max Q is noticeably faster than the non super variant and it almost reaches r-tx 2080 max Q levels we ran all of our tests in 1080p set to the high settings keep in mind if gaming is your priority I get that 1080p 140 for its display for the best smooth fast and fluid experience temperatures are really good and I expected that for a 17 inch notebook so on the CPU it initially spikes to ATC when clock speeds boost to 4.8 gigahertz but over time it averages to about 63 C but keep in mind that clock speeds do take a hit even with really good internal temperatures these surface temps were quite high especially at the bottom doing gaming workloads so I wouldn't put this thing on my lap for any of those GP or CPU intensive workloads the acoustic performance on the Aero series was actually pretty impressive now during idle mind you the system is pretty much dead silent but there is that coil one issue that I talked about earlier that's something to be aware of doing heavy load scenarios it's actually not that bad it doesn't sound like a jet fan so that's nice so to conclude let's go over some of the pros of the Aero 17 and the first thing that comes to my mind is that display it's absolutely gorgeous I think it's one of the main highlights of this laptop the colors are just beautiful its color accurate if you're a content creator colorist or if you're photographer this is what you should be looking into the performance differences or the performance improvements are respectable I mean if I were to be completely transparent if you're someone who's using a program that takes advantage of multi-core workload you will notice a difference with that extra four threads but if you're using 'too Vinci resolve or if your premiere editor there's absolutely no reason to upgrade to the new tension CPUs because there's no difference whatsoever as you saw by those results and the RT 27 a super is really fast it actually reaches r-tx 28 Emacs q level so I can't wait to see what the RT X 2080 Supermax q can offer I think that's something that I really want to get my hands on but what's really interesting is that I never saw this laptop hit 5.1 gigahertz according to Intel marketing slides when they officially launched these processors because the CPU technically can achieve 5.1 but I never saw clock speeds hit that but here's a million dollar question would I spend twenty eight hundred dollars on this laptop and the answer to that is a simple no because there are far more negatives with this laptop then the pros I talked about earlier the first thing is obviously the design it's way too sharp super uncomfortable to type on or just generally use I just feel like gigabyte should refine the design a little bit but they didn't do that the trackpad is really really bad I really wished if they you know were able to offer something the blades here is able to offer with a glass surface but that's not the case especially since you're spending this kind of money webcam worst possible location I mean it's just pointless I wouldn't even use it lastly there is the i/o I really wished if gigabyte it's really weird to see them go with USB 3.0 gen one instead of gen - it's not at a spec even though you can pick up a nine j'en processor on an older laptop with the updated specs so that's really weird so yeah overall I I don't know I can't I can't recommend this laptop it's just you know while the display is great the rest of it just fails to meet the expectations for the price point so well that note thank you so much watching make sure to check out some relevant content over here I hope you guys are staying safe and sound stay safe guys spend a responsibly spend responsibly I'll talk to you guys in the next one guys peace",

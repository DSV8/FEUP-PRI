This isn't a review of what could be a great duo of 2019 smartphones with amazing specs.

    "transcript": "so Samsung just announced a new phone it's called the Galaxy Note 10 has started actually that's in October anyways we have three new phones from Samsung guys that's right three models for the note series starting with a note 10 the note 10 plus and the note 10 5g now isn't 5g really interesting let me know in the comments down below now I got to spend some time with the note 10 and I think it's too early to come up with any conclusions given the price and the features it offers so I'm just gonna spill all the beans every specs features basically everything that you need to know about the Galaxy Note 10 a quick message from our sponsor the razor blade Pro 17 pushing performance to the edge what edge the edge where the snakes live it is now smaller and lighter than previous generations and cooler under heavy workloads thanks to additional fans and vapor chamber cooling the display is also factory calibrated for beautiful colors and impressively thin bezels to please your eyeballs for work and play with high performance max Q GPUs also let's not forget the wonderful connectivity options to future-proof this notebook the Razer Blade Pro 17 check it out below alright so what's new with the Galaxy Note 10 the design does look a little bit different from the note 9 so you're still getting the same boxy shape versus curved on the S10 series they've also reduced the size of the aluminum frame and have increased the amount of glass so durability is certainly a question mark and yes it is a curved display so there's that next up is the display and keyboard warriors prepare those fingers cuz this is gonna get really interesting so the note 10 comes with a six point three inch 1080p dynamic AMOLED display that's right 1080p on a flagship phone let that sink in for a moment you see to give you a little bit of context the galaxy note5 featured a 1440p display with a higher pixel density than the note 10 guys that's a four year old phone so take that for what it is and let's move on the note 10 plus comes with a six-point eight inch qHD plus display and all of these models are HD are 10 plus certified just like the s10 I did wish if Samsung went with a 90 hurt screen but unfortunately we're still stuck with 60 Hertz now you might also notice the camera cut out of the center it actually reminds me of Raven from Teen Titans you guys might disagree on me with that but nonetheless it looks different from the galaxy s 10 which was located on the top right hand side I have mixed feelings about this type of implementation but I'd like to hear your thoughts about this do you prefer this design over the s10 also I should also mention that the selfie camera features a 10 megapixel sensor with an F 2.2 aperture it's certainly a downgrade from the note 9 featuring an F one point seven eight megapixel sensor so I'm really curious to see how this will play out in low-light environments oh and let's take a moment to say farewell to the headphone jack I mean we saw this coming and there's another feature that they took off and that's expandable storage on the note 10 but not the note 10 plus which i think is ridiculous Samson's only offering one variant of the note 10 and that comes with 8 gigabytes of RAM and 256 gigabytes of storage the note 10 plus comes with 12 bits of RAM with users being able to choose between 256 or 512 gigs of storage by the way they are ufs 3.0 the battery size has also been reduced on the note 10 so it features 3500 milliamp hours that's 500 milliamp hours less than note 9 600 less than the S 10 plus but the note 10 plus features a 4,300 milliamp hour battery you see at this point the note 10 doesn't really look all that impressive on paper but it gets worse so pay close attention here so both the no 10 and the 10-plus come with 25 watt chargers out of the box but the note 10 plus supports samsung's new 45 watt chargers and those are sold separately here's another fact the note 10 supports 12 watt wireless charging whereas the note 10 plus can support up to 15 watts the rest of the features except for the s-pen are essentially a copy and paste from the s10 series so you get ip68 water-resistant reading wireless power share wireless charging the ultrasonic fingerprint scanner is supposedly the same from the s10 I really wasted they made some improvements here all right so let's switch gears and talk about the s-pen the most important feature of the note series I actually really enjoyed my time using the s-pen on the note 9 I'll be not as extensively but it was pretty cool to play around with so the s-pen on the note n is slightly redesigned to make it more ergonomic but they've added some more features over the previous generation it can edit your handwriting and they've also implemented air actions which is basically gesture controls with the s-pen you can swipe by holding the button and navigate through the gallery music skip through video you can use that to switch between the three different cameras as well at the back then there's a our doodle and as the name suggests you can doodle with the s-pen on a person and it would track that work which is pretty cool Samsung Dex is also getting a pretty big update so with previous Galaxy phones you needed an HDMI cable and a monitor to get text started up but with the Galaxy Note 1000s B cable that comes with the phone and you can plug it into a noble computer or a desktop PC and Dex would automatically start up essentially it will open a window within windows and you can seamlessly transfer files back and forth but I thought the whole point of Dex was to replace your notebook your PC or your whole computer this just seems to be I mean if you have a laptop on you why would you switch over to Dex because Windows is still superior to Dex in my opinion but I mean I'm curious to investigate this a little bit further on so certainly stay tuned for that now you can also use a regular DisplayPort cable and hook it up to a monitor and pay the note 10 with other accessories and have decks as a standalone setup to wrap things up let's quickly go over the cameras well actually there isn't anything new here the note 10 features the exact same triple camera layout STS 10 so you get the ultra wide-angle lens standard and telephoto no hardware improvements here I do like the vertical style of these cameras over the horizontal on ES 10 but that's just me I should also mention that the note 10 plus comes with a depth sensor that lets you track or scan an object in 3d and then you can do all sorts of creative stuff with it which is pretty cool I'm actually really looking forward to testing that when I get my hands on that but I also want to give a few thoughts between the don't ten and a know ten plus one of the things that I noticed was that the note 10 is actually a little bit smaller than the note 9 so essentially what they have done is that they taken the note 9 and they've chopped those bezels from that phone and they made the note 10 with underwhelming specs but the note n+ feels very much similar to the note 9 in terms of size and it feels about the same albeit that thin aluminum frame is a bit concerning for me I'm not sure how it durable that would be but I guess we're just not to test it out in the long term so definitely stay tuned for our full review so pricing for the note 10 starts at 950 dollars for the base model and the note 10 plus starts at $1,100 and the 5g version is a Verizon exclusive so here's my quick take on the Galaxy Note 10 and please don't consider this as a full review you see I'm pretty disappointed with this announcement because if you take a step back and analyze at what the note series was really known for things like a bigger display bigger battery s-pen headphone jack expandable storage all of those just come to mind it was the phone for super users but the note end does come with compromises and that's kind of unacceptable considering being close to the thousand dollar price tag it comes with a 1080p display shorter battery no expandable storage it just doesn't sound right the note 10 plus on the other hand looks like an upgrade over the note 9 with a bigger battery bigger display and more I think Samson is trying to capitalize on the s-pen with the regular no.10 but guys you don't have to spend that much money to get an awesome flash of Android like experience the Galaxy Note 9 is still an awesome phone heck the Galaxy S 10 is definitely worth its price or its current price right now in fact we've been seeing a lot of inexpensive phones getting really good as well so at this point I really want to know your thoughts about the Galaxy Note 10.1 in the comments down below I'm signing off and I'll talk to you guys in the next one",

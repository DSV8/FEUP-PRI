    "transcript": "The compact fluorescent lamp is, essentially, no more. Weve moved on. In our search for more efficient sources of lighting, weve gone full-steam-ahead towards the glowing computerchips we call LEDs. Im borrowing \"glowing computer chips,\" by the way, from a vehementlyanti-LED commenter who thought that was some sort of a derogatory quip, but honestly I think itsawesome! Glowing computer chips? Yes, please! Now, Im not about to go and make a video about TheSlightly Antique Light Bulb thats Better than Yours because today we are in an objectively better place. I wouldnt for a moment suggest that the CFL was a superior light source to honestly any LED bulb you can find today. Well, OK, perhaps better than the very dubiously-made LED bulbs that folks like Big Clive find on eBay, at least from shock hazards and prone-to-burning-your-house-down perspectives. But while these were flawed, problematic, and aesthetically suboptimal, in hindsight I think they got an unfairly badrap. And in this video, Id like to explain why. Lets begin with why these were a big deal technologically. The reason fluorescent lighting was a thing in the first place is that the technology produces much more light per unit of electricalenergy than is possible with incandescent bulbs. Fluorescent tubes also had a much longer life than the typical incandescent lamp. The efficiency and long life made fluorescent lights more economical, so in applications like office buildings, store locations, and other places where a lot of light was needed for a long period of time, fluorescent lighting made perfect sense. But for manyyears, the form factor was rather commercial. Long fluorescent tubes like these were thede facto standard for many decades. Sometimes wed get a little clever and bend them into a U-shape or maybe even a circle, but that was it. Now, these tubes are filled with a low pressure mixture of various gases and a tiny bit of mercury. When an arc discharge is produced along their length, themercury vapor emits a lot of ultraviolet light. A mixture of phosphors that coat the inside surface of the glass then convert this largely invisible UV discharge into visible light that we can see, makingthe mercury discharge useful for our eyes. Additionally, the glass itself blocksnearly all of the harmful UV wavelengths. It takes special quartz glass to produce UV-C germicidal lamps. Nevertheless many people wrongly assumed that ordinary fluorescent lighting produced harmful UV. It didnt, at least not in any remotely meaningful amounts. This is a bit of a tangent, but the clearest evidence of this is that the plastic lenses of fluorescent ceiling fixtures generally didnt yellow with time, which youd expect them to and rather quickly if the tubes were producingultraviolet light. UV is not kind to plastics. Anyway, you also need a ballastand starter circuit to drive these tubes. First, an arc discharge has to be established - after all, this is a long tube and getting electricity through plasma from this endto that end takes a bit of effort. There are many different ways to do this which arent important right now, but once its struck you have a new problem. Being a discharge lamp, you need a current-limiting device or else it will explode. OK, well maybe not explode, but discharge lamps have negative electrical resistance and without a current limiting ballast they would rapidly enter a sort of runaway condition and cause problems. So, with any given fluorescent fixture, youll have a ballast and starter of some sort driving some number of large tubes. As a result,fluorescent fixtures tended to be large. This is a basic shop light and as you can seeits lar- long. Four feet to be precise. Shorter tubes were available, and eventually you also had fun things like the circline tubes but in general fluorescent lighting was limited to overhead applications where space wasnt at a premium. So shop lights. Troffer lights. Surface-mountedlight strips. Et cetera. Applications that, for the most part, werent found in the home. Andif they were, it wasnt usually in a formal space. But wouldnt it be great if we could have the benefits of fluorescent light - that being longer life and lower energy use - in moreplaces? Heck yes it would. But how to do that? Well, you could build this thing which I made a video on quite a while ago, but thats definitely not the most practical way to go about it. What we reallyneeded was some sort of self-contained fluorescent lamp with an integrated ballast that is aboutthe same size as an incandescent bulb, and with hopefully the same brightness. And so, these things were born. This now iconic curly-q design was the final landing spot after a bunch of different experiments. See, theultimate limitation to how much light you can get out of a fluorescent tube isits surface area. With these long fellas that isnt much of an issue, but if you want toget the same amount of light as an incandescent bulb in the same amount of space using afluorescent tube, it takes some twisted thinking. This 60 watt equivalent lamp has a tube which begins here, travels in a helix to the top, then doubles back down theother side where it ends here. That allows it to occupy a volume smaller than a cube 2 inches or 5 centimeters on each side while the tube itself is roughly 14 inches or 35 centimeters in length. This alone is a huge achievement in manufacturing and design. This is glass, mind you. We needed a way to mass-produce hollow glass tubes formed into this intricate shape, and we did it! But that wasnt the only innovation, here. Thetube is driven at a higher intensity than an ordinary tube like this one. That allows its phosphorsto glow more much brightly. There seems to be an inverse relationship between the diameterof the glass and how intense the discharge is. You see this as we moved from the old T12 tubesdown to T8 tubes and eventually T5 tubes. Im not exactly sure why that is, hopefully one of you will let us know down below. But theres also one more trick upits sleeve. Its electronic ballast. Fluorescent lamps operate on the same AC power that everything else does. Because the voltage crosses the zero point 100 or 120 times per second, lamps run on traditional magnetic ballasts are actually pulsing at that frequency. This periodic dark time limits their output, but electronicballasts get around this by first converting the incoming AC power to DC and then drivingthe actual tube at very high frequency AC. The frequency is so high that the phosphors dont have time to decay between pulses, and the effect is the lamp is constantly litand does not pulse. This not only boosts it output further, but also eliminated the potentialfor eyestrain issues that old-style fluorescent lights could cause in some individuals. I actuallymade a video about that quite a while ago now. So. These were pretty neat little things. I keepusing the past tense but you can still buy them, theyre just very much out of fashion at this point. But they were a big deal. Bringing the advantages of fluorescent light to more places was, I would argue, a great thing. However, they werent receivedwith unanimous praise. And deservedly so, well discuss that shortly. At the same time,though, a lot of the hatred for these things just didnt make sense. At least, not holistically. The biggest problem with these things? Theyre nuanced. And we know how easily the general public engages with nuance. See, I have a pet theory that a large percentage of the aversion to CFLs came from people who really just didnt know that much about lighting in general. I would argue that the CFL was really the first mainstream way to get non-incandescent color temperatures in the home. Sure, fluorescent tubeswerent unheard of in the domestic environment. They found their place in garages and shop spaces, sometimes kitchens had them and linear over-the-mirror sort of deals in bathroomswere kinda common. But prior to the CFL, those sorts of odd applications defined whatfluorescent light was. Fluorescent light was that cooler, gray-blue light you saw at the office or in the store or maybe the basement. And see, heres where my theory comes in, ifthat was how you imagined fluorescent light, maybe you weren't even aware of the CFLs like this that mimicked the light from an incandescent bulb fairly well. Yes, Iknow there is and can even see the difference, but I would put money on there being lots of folks out there who wouldnt know this was a fluorescent light source unless they could seethe bulb itself. Their imagination is that *this* is fluorescent, and when the very idea of color temperature is a new concept to a lot of people, Id bet there was a lot of confusion that led to undeserved and sometimes misplaced hatred of these little fellas. No matter how hard store displays worked to show how warm the light actually could be. Again, this isnt meant to be a love letterto the CFL. They were bad in a fair number of ways. But even I, a really picky person when it comes to quality of light and color temperature, dont have a problem with most CFLs. Some werebetter than others, yeah, but at their peak a nice 2700K CFL in a table lamp like this? No problem. Aboutthe worst thing I ever notice is a slightly pink, occasionally green cast to the light, butits really only noticeable when you have another light to compare it to - if anentire room is lit with the same CFLs, my eyes would acclimate to it and I just couldnt see that color cast anymore. Of course, color rendering index isnt fantastic. Its really expensive to develop near-perfect phosphor formulations so nearly all lamps weregood but not great. But I dont think Ive ever run across a warm white CFL that messed withcolors to the point that I could notice without being hypercritical. I still have some CFLs kickingaround without any intention to replace them until they fail. In many applicationstheir limitations just dont matter so Im not about to bother upgrading them needlessly. But, and this was in my opinion their Achilles heel, the suitableness of CFLs was very situational. They wanted to be andwere sold as general purpose light bulbs but couldnt actually be used as such. Somefixtures were absolutely unfit for CFLs, despite the fact that CFLs could fit inside them. Similarly, some uses for them were impractical, and others would shorten their lifeconsiderably leading many folks to believe that they didnt last as long as theincandescent lights they were supposed to outlive tenfold. And yeah, often they didnt! Butin most cases that wasnt really their fault. Lets start with those untimely deaths. Heres afixture that seems perfectly appropriate for CFLs. Plenty of clearance for the lamps, not a problem. Except yes a problem! This fixture is enclosed. CFLs didnt get anywhere near as hot as the incandescent bulbs they replaced, but they still got hot. Trap one of em, or worsemultiple, inside a glass bowl with no airflow at all and youve made a torture chamber for them. Theelectronic components in their integrated ballasts are only rated to a certain temperature, whichcan easily be exceeded in fixtures like these. And so, premature lamp failure was almost a given in enclosed fixtures, and to be fair the packaging for these usually warned you that they werent suitable in enclosed fixtures (but who reads the packaging?). This is actuallystill something of a problem with LED bulbs, but many of them on the market today have electronics and temp sensors designed to limit their output and prevent overheating which allows them to be used without worry. But even simple orientation could be a problem with CFLs. If a fixture had its socket at the top and thus the bulb was hanging, a CFL would find itself with its ballast above the tube. The tube is thepart that gets hottest, and since warm air rises, well the ballast gets pretty hot. This wasntalways a problem - there could be enough airflow depending on the fixture's design. Butoften enough it was. More premature failures. Another thing that would kill them quickly? Frequent short use. Now, this problem didnt necessarily need to be a problem. But, because wehumans are impatient fickle things, we didnt like bulbs that behaved like this one. A delay betweenswitch-on and light is certainly annoying, but this is much easier on the electrodes at the ends of the tube. This programming allows thermionic emissions from the filaments at the ends to help strike the arc. Its the easiest way to do that, and the most gentle on the electrodes. Thisparticular bulb spent many years in a fixture on a timer and has undoubtedly racked up many thousands of hours, yet it still functions. But to the average person this was just annoying so instant-start ballasts became the norm. These essentially just blast a high-voltage charge right through the tube. And this does make for a delay-free start, but it comes at the expense of harming the electrodes. Each start wears them down a tiny bit, and while a long operating session may help restore them, when used in places like a closet or bathroom where the light is only onfor a few minutes at a time, that opportunity simply doesn't exist. The great irony here was thatthe instant start ballasts made them seem more practical for these short-use applications, but in actuality it made them much worse. The CFL was really best suited for general living space illumination that would be left on for long periods of time. But of course, much of thatcame from ceiling light fixtures like these which would harm the bulbs but in a different way. Where theycould really shine were in table and floor lamps, a lot of outdoor fixtures like these carriage things would do OK also Really, just any fixture where it wasnt upside down and had decent airflow would do alright. But what about recessed cans? Those are alwayshanging bulbs upside down. Well, this wasnt the only style of CFL. In their heyday, we were brute-forcing CFL tech into all sorts of weird and interesting places, like these imitation flood lamps (somewere even made to look like actual PAR lamps) or, my particular favorite, these teenytiny things that IKEA sold at one point (with an intermediate base to be just that extra bit of annoying) Still, even in suitable applications where they wouldnt overheat and die, CFLs still had drawbacks. A big, unsolvable issue was that when you first turned them on, they hadnt yet gotten their Fulbright scholarship. Fluorescentlamps take time to warm up as not all the mercury is a vapor when theyre cold. For generalpurpose lamps like these at room temperatures, this wasnt a huge deal. Theyd be abouthalf their normal brightness when cold, certainly not at their best but not unusableby any means either. And usually within just a minute or so, theyd be as bright as theyd get. But,for whatever reason, most of the specialty bulbs that came about over the years wouldstart out with next-to-useless brightness. Just take a look at this little flood thing. This isat room temperature but hasnt been started in a while. Turn it on and thats barely anything. Infact you can see the pink tinge brought about by the bit of neon in there used as a starter gas. Sometimes this would be purple suggesting argon was the starter gas. Anyway, after a whileit is nice and bright, but this is annoying. In my experience, nearly every non-standard CFL behaved just like this be it flood. Globe. A19 mimics. These weird little things. Really anything thatwasnt the standard exposed curly q. Im really curious about why cold starts seemed to be much worse in these specialty bulbs, especially since these floods, for example, are really just a standard lamp with a special shade. I have no idea why these should have darker starts than these ordinary lamps yet they do. Only thing I can think of is that having the tube enclosed led to higher operating temps thanks to a lack of airflow which required different vapor pressure characteristics which ultimately meant weak, slow starts. And then, regardless of type, using CFLs outdoors was interesting. In cold temperatures, theyd be *very* dim at startup and couldtake several minutes to reach full brightness. For something like a porch light thatll be on all night, well thats not too much of a problem but when it gets *really* cold, well they start to lose brightness. They cant actually reach their operating temperature when it's that cold, and on coldenough days they may not even be able to start at all. Not ideal. And, as you can imagine,their proneness to death by overheating meant that in hot climates theyd be even more at risk depending on the situation. Oh, and of course theres the elephant in the room. Mercury. Its not great stuff! Now, in some senses this problem was overblown. Theamount of mercury thats actually in these is miniscule, and its not like if you broke one youd need to exit the room in a panic and call a HAZMAT team else youll wake up the next day with an extra toe. Accidental breakage was not a four-alarm fire kind of event. But at scale,disposing of these in landfills is not good. They should be recycled, and unfortunately efforts todo this (particularly in the US it seems) were pretty sloppy. Some stores kept receptacles for you to return dead bulbs, IKEA was particularly good at this, but plenty of places left you in the dark on how to deal with a bulb that left you in the dark. You can never get 100% capture with anything, and while estimates for how many ended up being recycled are all over the place, in the bestcase its quite bleak. The majority of these were disposed of improperly. Yay. There are onlytwo ways to fix that problem: make it easier or perhaps incentivize recycling them (shameon policymakers for not getting that together) or eliminate them entirely. And luckilythats pretty much where were at. LED bulbs are still e-waste, to be clear, but they dont have mercury in them and thats a huge plus. In general, the LED bulb fixed all the problemsthat CFLs had (except maybe for RF interference problems) One particular thing that LEDs brought us that really just never got figured out with CFLs was dimming. Sure, dimmable CFLs did exist but in my experience they always sucked. I don't know what was so hard about that - at my old job we had TONS of ceiling fixtures in the lobby that had fixedballasts and replaceable lamps like these, and they handled dimming just fine. I guess it was just too expensive to figure out how to do that in lamp-integrated ballasts. Now, dimmable LEDs are everywhere, and theycome in all sorts of great styles with various features. Some of them are even smart. I thinkthey know algebra. Weve gotten good at designing LED lamps to dissipate the heat they generatewell, and to keep themselves in check when thats not possible. Color rendering these days is generally much better, even in basic lamps, and can be truly excellent in premium products. We are definitely in a better place today. But, these things? They didnt suck. Theywere important. Miniaturizing fluorescent lights into these tiny things was a featof its own, and I appreciate it greatly. CFLs also finally spurred development of warmwhite phosphor formulations that werent terrible. I mean, this circline tube is just horrid! Thatis not a warm and pleasant glow, GE. Its sickly. These were just misunderstood. I bet many ofyou can think back to a few of these that just kept on truckin' in fact maybe yourelike me and still have some going strong. When they were used in an appropriate application, they really werent half bad. If anything is to blame for their reputation, I think its that their abilities were oversold. A lot of them died too young simply because of how they were used, and its not their users fault! Manufacturers just want to sell you light bulbs, so theyrenot likely to help you figure out those details. And again, and I know Ive said this like a million times, its not like I miss these. Even in the best of cases, they would still lose output as they age which often lead to color shifting. They still take time to warm up, particularly when they're cold. Dimmability isstill rare and awful when it is there. But I dont look back on these with pure hatred. In fact,Im quite fond of what they managed to accomplish. The end. underappreciatedly smooth jazz I wouldnt for a moment suggest that the CFL was a superior ligh darnit! I missed a pause. Goin REAL great! ...to produce UV-C germicidal lambs.

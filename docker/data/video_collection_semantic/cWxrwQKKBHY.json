    "transcript": "- Have you guys seen these cases by Spigen? These have the retro iMac G3 theme. They've got three colors, Bondi Blue, Graphite, and Ruby. Those will fit your iPhone 15 Pro and your iPhone 15 Pro Max. And as soon as you put this on, I feel like it is a blast from the past. Before I open these up, a huge thank you to Spigen for partnering with me on this video. Now I unboxed these for the iPhone X, like, when was this? This was five years ago with the iPhone X. And this really takes me back to the days of when I really started understanding computers. I was just at that age where I kind of got it. I mean, I had been using them for a very long time, but leading up to the iMac, it was such a revolutionary computer, not only for consumer computing, but for me as a person. Like oh, so exciting. My family had a few iMacs in the days, but I do remember getting my grandmother her first Lime Green iMac and it was the most exciting thing ever. All right, let's open 'em up. (upbeat retro electronica) I can't believe how good these look. Now I remember back on the iPhone X, like those looked good, but this is, this has taken it to a whole nother level. Like, it actually looks like this, like 3D, like when I look at this, I don't know if you guys can tell, but it really does kind of look like it has like different layers. Like it really does have the feel of the iMac. Ooh, and I love that they even have a cutout here for the Apple logo! Okay, let's put it on. I literally feel like I'm gonna cry right now. Like I actually, like the tears. I'm gonna, I might, I don't, I'm gonna try really hard not to cry. (gasping) And good news! You do have access to the action button right here on the side, so you've got your buttons and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Like look how great this is. I even love that the bezels kind of come up right around the side so that when I drop my phone, it's not landing directly flat on the glass. This is so great, like you can still see the Apple logo in there. I'm so glad I have the natural titanium because it really looks perfect with this case. So beautiful, look at you. Ruby red, let's go! The red looks so good too. It's awesome, this is so exciting. I'm just like gazing at it like with just such delight. Let's put the last one on, the Graphite. Okay, the Graphite is pretty sick. I think this might be the one that I keep on just because it kind of really compliments the natural titanium and it's such a good vibe. These also do have military drop grade protection, which for me is very, very exciting. I've already dropped my phone so many times and I've ruined, I love that this is super durable. So this will be able to withstand all the things that I will probably accidentally put it through. So here's all three of the cases all lined up. Look how good they look. This is definitely taking me back to the future or, well, no, back to the, you know what I mean. If you guys wanna get more information about these cases, I'll put a link in the description where you can check it out. And huge thank you to Spigen for partnering with me on this video. And once again, I'm so glad that I could share these cases with you because obviously if you know me, you know that I'm a huge Apple fan and Apple has been such a huge part of just my being. A lot of my content here on my channel is Apple-focused. And for me, growing up and just finding Apple and computers, like it really did kind of set me on this whole other trajectory, especially when it comes to creativity. Even at a very young age, I've told all of these stories before. My mom was a teacher, so we had access to Apple computers 'cause at the time back then, like the only people that really ever had Apple computers were teachers and they had 'em in the classroom and then they had the availability to be able to bring them home or purchase them. So I'm super grateful for that and that my parents were always very supportive of my weird technology obsessions and I'm just so excited that now I could be here to show you these incredible cases. We're coming full circle here. Like, these cases are really cool, but everything that I've been able to find and do because of Apple, it really has changed my life. And I'm just so appreciative that all of you out there still watch my videos and I love being able to create content for you. So, oh my God, I'm getting like emotional and teary-eyed, like, why are you making me cry? I'm gonna go, I love you guys. Thanks for watching and thanks, Spigen, for making these cases and reminding us all that it's okay to think different.",

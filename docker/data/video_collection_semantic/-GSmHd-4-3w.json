I've always been a fan of Android and Windows; but after today (and for the next 30 days at least), I'm an Apple guy when it comes to portable devices. I spent my own money and will keep the products for longer than the return period for everything purchased, which means you'll hear my brutally honest opinions about Apple products for the next month. Is the buyer's remorse already setting in?    FACEBOOK:  TWITTER:  INSTAGRAM:   Subscribe to our channel!  Thanks for learning with us!

    "transcript": "okay I'm at Best Buy I'm about to buy two Apple products I've never done this before I've never owned any kind of MacBook any Apple computer before so that'll be interesting and yeah it's gonna be a bit expensive but maybe after the 30 days I'll find it it'll be worth that money I highly doubt that I have my reservations I've been an Android slash Microsoft guy for a long time making this which I'm sure will not be easy but uh least I get products that look good right okay just purchased these three things we'll go through it soon but yeah that was a pretty penny I will say okay so I came out spending a bit more than I thought I was going to spend going in I guess that's consequence of going in store but I have the goodies but once again more than I thought I would buy so I have the MacBook it's the m3 processor it's the newest addition the 2016 Edition I bought an Apple sport watch in the space gray color or whatever there that equivalent is because it's not exactly space grey and then I also bought an iPhone se so that's the basically the 6s internals but with the smaller form factor mainly because it was cheaper and I didn't want to spend more than 2 grand speaking of which I almost spent that I spent about $2,000 on all of that so and I also bought one of these which is a USB type-c 2 USB 3.1 thumb drive which I definitely need considering the MacBook only comes with one I guess external port and that's a USB type-c port so yeah I'm already starting to feel the buyer's remorse set in just a little bit I don't know I guess I guess I'll be able to assess how I truly feel about these things once I open them all up and start playing around with them so I guess that's the next part of the video let's go and do that okay so after well a few hours of getting everything situated East have an Apple account with my iPhone 5s that I had before I produced my note 4 so I synced all that up now when I get an iMessage notification or any any message notification for that matter it all goes to here as well and it goes to my new Apple watch so yeah these were the theory things that I purchased they're all synced up I wanted to get all that set up before I started filming so it looked like I kind of knew what I was doing now but there are a few things that I do notice right off the bat that I do absolutely love about this thing and that's what I want to share with you guys in this first little vlog e style video here so first off right away yes everyone for the most part knows this we're looking at a USB type-c port here on the left and that's it so first off this thing has a USB type-c port on one side obviously and then the other side right here boom USB 3.1 so yeah 32 gigs of it's only like 17 bucks so it's better than nothing and this will allow me to transfer files from my desktop to to my macbook which is great so that this is kind of a must-have this is like the bare minimum I would recommend there are like Docs you can plug in here that kind of just add expandable storage ports here USB 3.0 HDMI evens things like that that you can add here on the left side because that is it folks that's all you get is that one tiny little port over there in the corner and not too many things at least currently are using that so that's something you have to consider when you purchase something like this the other side obviously nothing but a single headphone jack this is already really weird I'm just I'm not used to this like the whole operating system is just so so different I I don't I've never owned a MacBook I've never used OS X for longer than like an hour and so yeah I'm having to learn how to navigate how to do everything now this I am familiar with I am familiar with my iPhones I've used iPhones in the past now this is the se so we're looking at iPhone 6s specs so the a9 chip all the goodies 64-bit architecture of course but in the iPhone 5s form factor which I actually like I like the smaller kind of more compact phones much different than my Galaxy Note 4 just somewhere somewhere behind me and again like I've got the matching spacecraft space grey and at the same time the app watches it's almost a matching color it's slightly darker than the than the actual one that's actually in the light it actually is a little lighter so yeah I kind of get all three match in here Space Gray that's my favorite color Space Gray and the these MacBooks and iPhones and all that good stuff so yeah I like the color coordination looks like I kind of what I'm doing so first off I want to address how beautiful this screen is it is absolutely gorgeous I'm in love with Retina displays I love the IPS technology in like insane viewing angles I mean there's like no look at that you know you're not getting into that weird color Distortion you know the lights turn to darks and all that good stuff so that's the lovely thing about inter plane switching screen technology on top of that you get great brightness so right now we have it maxed out you see which down to half brightness here it's still definitely doable I used to use this all the time this is a membrane keyboard so it has a kind of a kind of a mushy feeling to it but it is very responsive there is plenty of key travel so you know when you're engaging the key anyway that's that's something that's important for me and over here we have a mechanical keyboard sums from Aki my review of this keyboard is right right there but this is a mechanical keyboard these riches and they feel completely different than the other two that I just showed you so I have three different keyboard experiences here and I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this is the greatest feeling of all three I mean really the only difference is the key travel obviously you're not going to have very much key travel at all on these very thin laptops so I think these butterfly switches here so it's kind of a like a picture cross pattern when you push the top of the key they kind of just fold in like that that's essentially what's going on inside each of these key switches so I am still trying to figure out this whole operating system deal I know that this down here is where I can find pretty much everything so that's good I kind of can relate this to the windows experience it's really weird having to go to the top-left to exit and maximize windows and whatnot not the top right like I'm used to on Windows but I mean I'm willing to make some compromises for the sake of well extreme portability for one this laptop is super portable super slim 12-inch screen I mean really this laptop is so thin when I do it like when I move it to here the camera thinks I'm trying to trying to focus on stuff behind it I can't even get it to be detected by the center autofocus here but this laptop is very very thin something I was looking for in a laptop I was tied between this and a Dell XPS 13 I know a lot of people who use Microsoft your Louisville windows would have told me that an XPS 13 would've been a better choice but this is this is something different I wanted to change things up that's why I purchased this I don't have buyer's remorse not like I thought I would after spending worth like $2,000 and all three of these things I just really like how they're all coordinated so this is literally almost tied to this in every way and then my my watch is tied to my phone via bluetooth so really everything is just-just coordinated so beautifully and that's that's the perk of going with one company one manufacturer for all of your devices okay so one thing I'm noticing is that geek wench for takes a lot longer than Geekbench three days to finish and I say that because well I don't really know how long this should take but on my editing rig we're looking at 2 minutes and 20 seconds is going to be around 2 minutes and 30 35 seconds by the time this finishes so that's considerably longer than my geek bench 3 required to finish its test around maybe 50 55 seconds with a core i7 6700 K so I here we go I guess we're getting some live results here single core ok these are definitely different scores than then what Geekbench 3 is pushing out so 23:46 and 4663 obviously nowhere close to what the i7 pushing out but I will say this for a laptop that's using a core m3 which is only a dual core hyper threaded like point 9 gigahertz CPU that's really it's really not too shabby I do have something that will actually allow me to edit video clips that's gonna be a lot better experienced than my one over 100 s was now but most of my editing again will remain on my custom PC here so yeah you're seeing kind of a comparison here obviously the single core of this chip is better than the the actual multi-core score of the m3 here on the MacBook 2016 but like what can I say so we ought to see how I have been able to handle blackest applications with the MacBook I am an engineering major so we're you know I'm in the core of my of my degree right now on the senior so I'm taking a lot of classes that require heavy programs we'll see if this thing can can handle a that if I have to do it all on my desktop and obviously I fluent really don't really expect too many problems with that this is sporting the 12 megapixel camera and that's yeah the a9 chip oh I don't really care much more about than that and then the Apple watch that's just something that I kind of just picked up on the spot I said well I'm going Apple here and here so I might as well just get the full package I will say one thing the MacBook speakers in here are absolutely crystal clear I I did not I didn't I really didn't expect to have such good speakers in such a slim device so that's another plus for this there's just other things that I keep discovering about these devices that that I really really enjoy that I guess taking away from that buyer's remorse that I otherwise would have experienced speaking of which if you think that I should experience buyer's remorse be sure to let me know in comments below obviously make a lot of hate for this because I've been switch entirely from Windows to this and from Android as well to Apple OS X and iOS just let me know what you think about the transition be sure to stay tuned for the other vlogs be posting multiple blogs with the course of the next 30 days and then we'll have the final verdict 30 days from now and I guess I'll make up my mind whether or not I'm going to keep these or just sell them off not gonna be returning these products so it's all spent it's going to be spent I'm not returning them so this is just a might are going to eat the cost or I'm going to enjoy the products I've been with their day period but anyway folks be sure to give this video a like if you thought it was cool give a dislike if you feel complete opposite or if you hate everything about life be sure to click the subscribe but if you have already stay tuned for well more of these vlogs and some more tech related stuff I have a good one regarding CPUs coming up tomorrow this is science studio thanks for learning with us and bearing with me",

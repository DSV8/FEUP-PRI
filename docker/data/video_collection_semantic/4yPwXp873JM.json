    "transcript": "- Today we are checking out the Jaguar, Jaguar? Jaguar; the problem is they say it, Jaguar, I say Jaguar, and then I get made fun of. (short beep) Behind me is the Jaguar I-PACE. This is Jaguar's first electric SUV, and we get to test it out today. Last year my sister and I went to Austria for the launch of this SUV and we had so much fun, I got a chance to host the livestream, so if you guys remember this; - I love the way you say Jaguar. - That's how we say it. - You've literally never sounded more American than being right here in Austria. - So let's take it for a drive. (mellow rock music) We're here cruising through Toganga Canyon right now, this is so much fun, I actually have the GoPro up above, on the roof, and everyone is holding on. These canyon roads are a little curvy. But what's great is with the regenerative braking, anytime I take my foot off of the pedal it's braking for me, and that's regenerating power, so I'm actually charging my car. (mellow rock music) Regenerative braking is when the car slows, the energy is created within the car's braking system. In a non-electric vehicle, this energy is wasted, but in an electric vehicle, that energy can be captured and used to give the car more energy for more range. On a full charge, it can go 234 miles. It also goes zero to 60 in 4.5 seconds with 394 horsepower, and let me tell you what, it's so fast. The first time I put my foot to the pedal, I was like, what? I flattened my sister against the seat. She was like a pancake. She puffed back out. - Hey; I puffed back. - (laughing) She puffed back out. Oh my God, I love this car so much. Okay, let's no keys push the start. (ignition system beeping) It also has really great cup holders. You can get an 80% battery charge from empty in 40 minutes using a hundred kilowatt DC fast charger. They're available nationwide through charging suppliers like Charge Point and EVgo. For most of this trip I had been using Charge Point. The Jaguar I-PACE won three World Car of the Year awards. This is the first time that this has been done by a single vehicle. Oh wow, tight squeeze; good thing I'm a compact SUV. (mellow guitar music) Yeah. Aerodynamics are so important in an electric vehicle. To maximize the airflow over the car, there's a gap at the top of the grille for air to enter. Then a scoop in the hood for the air to flow up over the car. The air then flows over the roof and is directed over the rear spoiler, which has a special peak design for maximum aero efficiency. We're going on a road trip. - Whoa! - Whoa! (laughing) So the first thing that we need to do is pack up, I'm actually really surprised how much room is in this thing, I was a little concerned 'cause Jen and I pack pretty heavily. - [Jen] Too much. - I mean, I have an entire suitcase dedicated to Matty, an entire suitcase dedicated to my gear, plus myself. - Don't worry, you got it. Beep, beep, beep, back up, back up. Matty, you want your heated seat on? You want warm butt? - We are off to San Diego; it's gonna take two and a half hours to get there. (Jen gasps in surprise) I'm sorry; we're finally on the road, three and a half hours late, my fault, I have 213 miles to go until I need a full charge, and it looks like we have 104 miles until we get to San Diego, which is an hour and 42 minutes. Traffic doesn't look to be too bad. - Don't jinx it. - Don't jinx it; I have my air conditioned seats on right now, it's so crazy, I've never had these before. It's like, it's really chilling my body. So I charged this for the first time last night, it was about 75%, so it took about three and a half hours to charge, this is great, we won't even have to charge the entire way there, and we'll just plug it in at a spot at the hotel, and be good to go. (upbeat electronica music) Our update for you guys, we have 151 miles remaining on this charge, but I just wanna see how easy it is to find someplace to charge, so in the maps you can search along your route to find a charging station, so, Jena just did that, so Jena, hit that first charging station. (Matty whimpering) - [Car Navigation System] After 0.1 mile you will reach your destination On south Tremont Street. - We're almost there. - [Jen] South Tremont Street. (Matty whimpering) - Slowly; well this is my first time. Give me some juice. Now we charge, and walk the dog. (upbeat electronica music) - [Jen] Oh, hey Jes. - Oh hi, I'm just unplugging my EV. Juiced, let's go. - [Jen] Where you going? - I don't know. - [Jen] No, we exit that way. - Oh really? - Yeah. - Is this enter? Is this enter? - Yes. - This is enter only? - [Jen] It literally said exit. - This is enter only? - [Jen] Uh-huh. - That is enter only. So I got off the wrong exit. - Yeah, I told you. - I know. - It told you. - It told me not to get off here, but it looked like this is where I was supposed to get off. - [Car Navigation System] 50 feet towards California 76 Coast Highway. - It's pretty out, it's very pretty. (laughing together) - It's a really pretty day. It's a really pretty day; okay, so zero, to 60. - [Jen] You stay in this lane. - I'm staying in this lane. So the glass is acoustic laminated, so that reduces the road noise because this car is so quiet. Like, when I'm not driving, you don't hear anything, which is so, it freaks me out, cause you don't ever hear electric vehicles when they're coming up on you. - But it's also quiet while you are driving cause it's reducing the noise that's coming inside. - Exactly. - Like your own noise. I'm into it, this is a good napping car. With you driving, maybe you can't nap as comfortably, but it's a good napping car. - We're turning in here. - Yes, we are, actually, that is correct information. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, this is good. - [Car Navigation System] Now turn right. - She had a little laugh, she goes, (giggling) now, - Turn right. - Turn right. - She's probably laughing at you cause you got lost. - I got a little lost. - That's what you get for not listening to me, lady. (mellow percussion music) - Matty; what are you doing? The Fairmont, look at this; are you hungry? They gave you a dog bowl and a plate. This is for you. Eat your dinner. We finally made it, we're staying at the Fairmont in San Diego, and this place is so beautiful. It's the Fairmont Casa Del Mar, and this, this is so great, look at this. This bathroom is massive, and a note. Oh my gosh, it's so pretty. Look at the flowers; wait, there's Jenna. Oh my goodness. (upbeat electronica music) (upbeat rock music) It is day two, we're still in San Diego, and we're gonna go on a hike now. The I-PACE is kickin', I am really enjoying driving this thing so much, it really is so fun. But Jenna just went up ahead of me, and we're going on a little hike, so let's go. - Hello, it's such a nice day out today. - [Jen] It is so nice. - We're about to go on a trail, I feel bad we didn't bring Matty. - I know, I didn't that dogs would be allowed because usually they're not allowed; guess what, we messed up. - [Jen] It's probably better though, cause there's a lot of children. And a lot of dogs. - He doesn't really like kids. (soft rock music) Have we arrived? - I think we keep going. - Okay, let's go. I have so much stuff in my pockets that I have to go sideways. Oh my gosh, there's a ladder. Probably shouldn't be climbing this with only one hand available. Oh, we did it, we made it. Going to see the sunset I lost the car keys, so Jenna ran ahead of me. You're looking good. (mellow new age music) We had so much fun, this property's incredible. Matty; hey, Matty, Matty. Matty had the best time. Oh yeah, the car is here. Now the real test is is it charged to 100%? This is great, it's officially 100% charged, and now we're gonna head home. Look at that, we have 248 miles to go. Back to Los Angeles. (mellow electronica music) (short beep) So here's a really exciting update; I'm about to go hiking, and there was no parking anywhere, all of the lots were full, except for this wonderful spot that says I can park here because I'm EV, and it just so happens, I need to get charged up. Matty, do you love EV lifestyle? (giggling) Oh now, he's getting stuck on the bullhorns. He had to potty really badly. (upbeat electronica music)",

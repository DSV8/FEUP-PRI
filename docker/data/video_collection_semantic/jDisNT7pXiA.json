    "transcript": "- The Fractal Meshify 2 C is or it might not be the best computer case but it's easily top three for sure. And if building in it is easy today then like top one or two, probably. It's freaking sweet, it looks awesome and it should keep your components cool. What's not to like? Come on. Meshify 2 Compact user's guide. Yeah that's a fine looking PC right there. One of the big things over the last one was before in order to like get that the dust filter in here, it was a terrible time. Now what to do you just pull on that logo right there and boom, dust filter. Oh, oh okay. This comes off. You just pull it a bit and boom. Okay, very easy access to the dust filter. Okay, the top filter is not magnetic, which I actually like I find those always get kind of like misplaced and I believe it's totally toolless. Woo, yeah. So that just comes right off. Let's put that back on for now. Rear I think is also toolless This is gonna be so easy here today. I really like this design in the front. For IO you get two USB 3, headphone, microphone and new for this one is the type C up here as well, maybe around. Yeah, it's a computer case. There you go. Let's start building. I want to do it. I've selected components that are according to the side of the box will fit, but very close to not fitting. I believe you can take off the top as well. Yeah, this just. Heck yeah. This is going to be such an easy build. Accessories, all look pretty standard. If you look on the bottom here as well, it's the filter. You just pull from the front, bring it out like that. Super easy to clean. I am going to remove the hard drive trays just to get the PSU in and then we'll have to put them back on. Oh, there's a first kind of stupid thing. The foot interferes with where the hard drive tray's screw is. Okay, we'll just move it up as far as we can go for now. This also has the power supply, a removable thing, which makes getting your power supply in so much easier. Today we're going with the Seasonic Prime TX 1000. I don't have any good reason besides this is a really thick power supply. That's kind of the long and short of it right there. It smells good too. Those power supplies should just go in, doing it this way makes your life so much easier than trying to like get all the cables in afterwards once it's inside. I do really like that they already have some straps here for your CPU power. So today for a CPU, we're going with a 10900K, it's hot. But most importantly it was at my desk and I already had built this computer. So we don't have to worry about it not working or anything. I also have two sticks of Ram for 16 gigabytes in total. And there's already an SSD in here. I think that's a 970 Evo. Oh, this is so nice with the top gone. I did make what could have been quite a bad mistake right there, because I totally forgot to add in the cooler mounting but this case does have the big old hole in the back so I'll be able to access that when the time comes in a couple of minutes. Building PCU is so easy now. Yeah, back in my day, you had to get a bunch of cuts from the unfinished edges on your steel case. It should be noted that they give you exactly how many screws you need to attach the motherboard and the power supplies. So don't drop them on the floor. You guys get a bit of a bonus here on short circuit 8 two unboxings in one. This is the ARCTIC Liquid Freezer II 280. And as far as I can tell, it's pretty fricking sweet. According to Gamers Nexus the performance on this thing's really good. But at the same time Arctic's performance has been quite good for a while now. My concern is more so just the mounting. Oh geez. She's a bit big. Well, this is gonna be fun. One silly thing about this is they have a little fan up here. That's supposed to cool down your VRMs. I feel like it's not gonna be useful for almost everyone. It's left from that, I think it looks pretty cool. Huge of MX for here. Well I still have easy. Ooh, okay. If you're building in this case, you should not install your AIO before you put power to everything. I would do that last. For a GPU we're going to be using the AORUS RTX Xtreme 10 gigabyte. It's a 3080, and it is fricking huge. I think we have just a couple of millimeters of clearance. Nice, no problems there. Oh geez. This is a very big cooler for this, but it should be fine. So this is where taking the top out is pretty fantastic 'cause now we can drop this down in here. Oh, maybe. It does say up to 240 on the top. - [Jono] Are those 280s? - This is the 280? Okay. Doesn't fit, not even close. So long Arctic you sent us a cooler and that actually was really easy to put in but the one that you sent us is too big. All right, moving on to my favorite cooler in the world the NHD 15, it's big, it looks sick, it cools your stuff really well. No complaints. It's what I use my personal rig. Again I know I've said this like 10 times but this would be terrible if the top was still on. Oh, do you think that I can get in the fan for the CPU cooler without removing the GPU? It is right up against the cooler. I'm going to use this hook. It's in the iFixit kit, maybe. Hell yeah. Did it. Wow, we almost have a computer. So let's get the cables in here. Oh man, we just got so lucky. So on a lot of motherboards, it is possible that the USB headers will be down under where the graphics card is right now. And I totally forgot to connect them. But on this one, they're just up here above the GPU. So we're good. Now it does seem like there's no fan hub included with this. The original one, I think only had one, 120 millimeter fan up in the front. This one you get the two 140s and also a 120 in the back. So that's way more cooling for your components out of the box. Like when you're buying a case in this price range, this one's $110 the old one was 90. You're probably not going to want to spend like 50 bucks on sick knock to a fans. So it's really nice that they have these pretty good ones here stock. For storage. I'm going with a 12 terabytes, Seagate Exos. It's overkill for pretty much anything. The only reason that I have it is because it just arrived in the office. And it's the first hard drive that I saw when I went looking for them. It's got the cage here. Is it only one screw? Nice, and then this I believe just goes right on like that. The hard drive just slides right back in there like that. No, it was very easy. Now we do want to reattach the hard drive cage. I feel like kind of no matter what you want to move it as far forward, as you can, just to give yourself more space for all the cables. Hey Jono, how much effort should we put into cleaning up the back of this case? [Jono] Zero. - Zero? What about you put on a timer for two and a half minutes and whatever we can achieve in that amount of time is how good the back's gonna be. Timer for two and a half minutes. Speed cable management, yeah. This straps are not as good as I originally thought 'cause you can't really tighten them down, but at the same time, way better than no straps at all. Oh, balls. All right, screw it we're just bundling it. Minute 30. Oh balls, It's cramming time now - [Jono] 4, 3, 2, 1. - For 10 minutes and 30 seconds. I think that's a really clean backside of your case. Now the one big thing that you don't get with this case is RGB. There's basically. Yeah, there's none. There's just no RGB at all. You can put the top on now Back panel. This I think came off the bottom. Yep. Are we done? I think we're done, hour and a half? Not too bad. Especially given that we probably could have saved nearly half an hour if we didn't bother with the air cooler there. That was especially for the size of this case an exceptionally easy little PC build. I don't know about you guys but I think that this is a fantastic looking rig. I really like this case. Its biggest competitor is easily the O11-Dynamic-mini but the reason why I'm more inclined to recommend this one is because this takes a full ATX power supply the O11-mini you have to use an SFX L so that gets really expensive really fast. If you're trying to put like a thousand watt or like anything about 600 Watts in it. Heck yeah. Well, there we go. The Meshify 2 Compact is a fricking awesome little case. And I think if you're looking for a case and like, you know about $110, you really can't go wrong with this thing. Hit, like get subscribed, have a great old day. See ya.",

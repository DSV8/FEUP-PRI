    "transcript": "You may have noticed that every time I say its time for a simpler video its a lie. For the record, it doesnt start as a lie its just well, I start writing the script at the beginning. Seems to make sense to do it that way. And so, Ill say ah, this is a simple idea! Itll be simple! Simple! and thenit just snowballs into a five part series. Not today! We are just gonna talk about this thing. Back when I made the humidifier video I showed one of these. Its a basic hygrometer. It has a dial and a pointy bit and what the pointing bit points to is, roughly, what the ambient relative humidityis. Simple. Some of you asked how this works. And honestly, yeah that's pretty intriguing,isnt it? It doesnt take any batteries, and if you look through the back you can kind of get a peek at a coil-like thing. That looks an awful lot like a bimetallic strip! Whats a bimetallic strip, you ask? Its a strip made of two metals. Thats useful because different materials have different thermal expansion properties. Virtually everything expands a bit when it gets warmer, and metals are no exception. But how much they expand depends on the specific material. When you take two metals that are not the same and sandwich them together in the form ofa strip, the mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients between them will cause the stripto bend slightly as the temperature changes. Bimetallic strips are in all sorts of places, from the worlds greatest toaster, to blinking Christmas lights, tothe thermostat of space heater, to, well, thermostats in general. Buta classic and simple application of the bimetallic strip is in a thermometer like these. And lets just get it out of our systems, yes these numbers are meaningless to many of youout there and maybe one day well stop using this temperature scale round these parts but I cantthink in Celsius any more than you can think in Fahrenheit and besides, a zero to one hundred scale that correlates well with the range of tolerable ambient temperatures is a more pleasing way to do it from my perspective and - hold on this is a tangent, now. I want to show you something. Seethis? This is called a search engine. Theres all sorts of them out there thesedays. And most of them let you do this: 70 f to c. Blam. There it is. You have asmartphone, right? It probably has a search bar in a very convenient place. Oh and maybe youeven have a voice assistant you can literally just ask what whatever temperature is in whatever otherscale you like better. It really is that easy. Now, when it's appropriate, Ill continue to provide conversionshere on this YouTube channel because it would be careless of me not to, butwhen I dare to offhandedly tweet something and use one of our silly units I dont wanna hear it. Youll spend way more time composing your complaint to me than youwill just googling the conversion yourself. We are all very aware of how silly the aversion to the metric system is but we cant help it. Oh, and yes I am on Twitter. Its mostly punsand other dad jokes. And snark like this! OK, lets get back on track. In a thermometerlike this, the bimetallic strip is formed into a coil with the outside end secured in place andthe inner part of the coil attached to a pointer. Although the amount the strip bends when the temperature changes is slight, forming a coil compounds thateffect with each rotation. You end up with a coil that contracts as it gets colder, and expands as it gets warmer. Or potentially vise versa. And so, the center of that coilrotates somewhat as the temperature changes. Attach a pointer to the center of that coil, and with a little experimentation and calibration youll have created a simple device which indicates the current temperature. The effect is surprisingly linear. Thespacing between these numbers is consistent through most of the travel, althoughyou can see it vary somewhat at the ends. So, if we take this thing apart through The Magic of Buying Two of Them we see what appears to be two bimetallic strips. One for the tiny, mostly useless thermometer they give as a token gesture, and the other for the hygrometer. But this oneis actually a bimetallic strip tease. Sure, its essentially the exact same idea, but how cantwo dissimilar metals give you a humidity reading? Well, they cant. In factnot bimetallic, but it is bimaterial. Take a closer look at it and youll see that one side ofthe coil appears to be covered in a sort of paper. And thats because it is. This style ofhygrometer, fittingly named the Metal-Paper Coil hygrometer, functions identically to that of a bimetallic thermometer. The key difference is that the salt-impregnated paper changes basedon humidity. This is one of those things that seems puzzling at first but then absolutelyobvious once you know it. Like, you know what happens to paper on really humid days. It gets allfloppy and gross. Same sort of thing goes on here. The paper side of the coil will deform slightly as humidity increases, changing the overall tension on the coil. Thatmakes the needle move. Watch what happens when I put a bit of water directly on the paper. Thecoil quickly deforms and the needle shoots to very damp. And here youll notice that thescale is very much not linear. Low humidities are far apart, indicating that the effect ofhumidity on the paper diminishes as humidity increases. And this clock is why I decided to make this little video. I bought it when I bought the other clocks for the last video because itwould actually be useful to me and I had a perfect spot for it outside. But as soonas I realized the humidity scale was linear, I got suspicious of this thing. Sure enough, itscrap. It agrees with this one around 50 percent or so, but this wont ever read higher than maybe 80percent? This one read 90 and this only read 75. No good. In fairness, metal-paper coil hygrometers arentsuper accurate to begin with. This website I found says theyre only good to about 10%. And its not like I couldexpect the hygrometer in a $10 Walmart clock to be any decent to begin with. But if you eversee a linear scale on a hygrometer like this, its definitely not one of the betterones. OK, well probably not - I havent yet tested this one at the time of filming. Ill pin a comment with the final verdict. This melding of paper and metal isnt the only way to go about it, of course. In fact, it seems to be a rather new-fangled way to do it, presumablyits just very easy to manufacture inexpensively. All you really need to make a hygrometerlike this is some sort of spring thats pulling on something else which will deform basedon humidity. The first hygrometers that worked on this principle used actual human hairs. Thehair would lengthen with increased humidity, reducing tension on a spring or pulley, andthus allowing an indicator of some kind to move. As it dried out, the opposite occurred and the indicator moved in the other direction. This style of hygrometer is still made, but its a rather specialist sort of thing. However, they can be quite accurate when calibrated, withone manufacturer claiming accuracy to within one percent at room temperatures! However, I foundother sources which arent quite so optimistic. The worst thing about these cheap hygrometers is their accuracy. While the hair-tension method might be a little bit more accurate, it may still not be as accurate as you can be with other means. Other means? What other means? Well, the humidistats in the humidifiers I showed you are electronic. The actual component that becomes affected by humidity is simpler than the circuitrythat interacts with it. Typically there will be a polymer or salt of some sort that's exposed to air, and the electrical resistance of this material changes with the moisture absorbed in it and thusthe ambient humidity. Measure its resistance, compare that to a lookup table, and now you know therelative humidity within a few percentage points. These days this rather basic task can be done at the component level, allowing a simple interface between a sensor and whatever device youre putting it in. There are other techniques involving materials which exhibit changes in their capacitance, but the essence of all of them is in the material which changes in some way depending on ambient humidity. It can be something we measure electrically, or it can be something that moves a pointer like a piece of paper or a human hair. What weve done with these devices, including the thermometers, isquite simple but also quite profound. Figuring out how environmental conditions affect different materials allowed us to work backwards and define those environmental conditions using thematerial as a reference. Those humans, so clever! While it may be more technically impressive to do that using electronicals and hook it up to a microcontroller which can beam god-awfulblue numbers straight into your retinas, thats just not as satisfying asthese simple things. Turning the physical properties of something into a, well,turning motion is never gonna get old to me. I told you itd be simple! Now Ill havefun looking at the YouTube studio and seeing my watch time metric tank. Itll be great. Oh yeah, sorry. No music or credits today. Just this. Take a closer look, and you'll see that one of zah elbledebuh be deh. plerh",

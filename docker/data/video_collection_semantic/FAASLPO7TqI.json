    "transcript": "- I love wires and they've always kind of kept me away from, you know, the tiny little of them ear buds. You know you lose them, you don't have them anymore. They fall out. The new Beyerdynamic Xelento wireless headphones kind of have the best of both worlds. They've got wires. Yay! That come down to a little neck thing and you're not going to lose them when you're out and about. This is a new kind of flagship product from Beyerdynamic. It's kind of their, one of the most expensive things that they make. And you know, I've got new types of drivers that I've not really seen before and kind of a very interesting way to interface with your phone. A kind of, I guess like a standard in ear monitor. Box is a bit mucked up I think. I think labs might have tried to open it with their teeth or something. Let's have a look. Oh my god, did he like get in there with it? Pull tab here and this opens up like that. Oh my god, they're tiny. Look at that. Over there. What else we got in here? You know, piece of plastic with some information. We have, I guess, this is a little carrying case. No, this is the neck piece, isn't it? Oh there we go. Might just wear that for now. We've got our connection cables. So you can use these wired, which is great. Maybe you don't have your phone or you just want to use your own preamp or something like that. You don't have to use their driver or deck. Got a USB cable I assume for charging. We'll find out. Instruction manuals. A certificate of authenticity, which is always cool. This one comes with like loads of different tips and things like that. Can't get, the box. Okay, it was glued to the box. Sure, sure. Barron Hammick, whatever. Why? Why would you do that? What is this? A little cleaning cloth? Oh that's cool. It's not even tips. These are like little clip things. I have no idea what those would be useful for. What else? Oh my god, there's so much stuff in here. Look at all of those. Those like hundreds of them. From what looks like extra small, all the way up to XXL, three XL. I can't read today. And look at these little guys. They're adorable. So apparently these are handmade in Germany. Looks like they're all metal. Very nice matte finish on the side there. The connection point for the cables here 'cause we'll have a look at this thing. So yeah this is the Bluetooth interface neck thing and it's a kind of like a really nice siliconized band here. Very flexible with our connection points for the headphones here. And then there's your USB point for charging and we have this also metal kind of volume adjustment, and your music switch or whatever else. You make calls on this too. It's got microphones and here's number two. Clicks in there really nice. These rotate. I like the look of the buds, I like their kind of the two-toned appeal of them with the the matte finish on the back, and the now immediately covered in fingerprints. Shiny side on the the front. They feel really high quality. The connection here is really good. Hopefully they stand out for sound quality. I think the build quality's there. Cable's nice and siliconized and easily flexible. You're probably not going to feel that too much. I'm just noticing the weight of this on my neck, and it's not too oppressive, but I'm definitely noticing it. Certainly touching here. I mean you've got the cold of the metal so if you're using this in like, I don't know, Canadian winters like we have right now, I think these would get cold and press into your neck and that would be unpleasant. But I mean if you're outside wearing them, then you're going to have it around a collar like this. I don't feel it at all. Now putting them in is not a problem. You go up and over, push them in, wrap the cable around the top of your ear. They feel really good in the ear. They just sort of disappear. I'm not going to be able to talk very well 'cause I'm not going to have any of the outside voice. There we go. Seal feels good. Hopefully they have some sort of pass through. We'll check that out in a second. We have an app with it as well. But first I forgot tell you about our sponsor dbrand, they're chaotic (beep), but they make good stuff like this grip case. It has a super grippy texture, it's impact resistant. It can be customized with any of dbrand skins like this new pallets collection that dbrand just released. Check them out at shortlinus.com. I call them nipples 'cause he only comes up to here. We also have a companion app which is kind of always terrifying. Just boop Linus's nose here. One thing I like is, you open the app, and it doesn't ask you to make an account. It just goes connect your headphones immediately. So this little logo here is a button, going to hold it down, see if it does anything. Yeah, it did. We have a little light here, and it's blinking blue and red. Hey, there we are. So I'll connect to these. Let's go back to our app here I guess. There we are. Choose. And we're done. That was very simple and easy. Good job. They do have firmware so we're going to have to update them and see how long this takes. We got a blinking white light here as we're doing the update or is that purple? It's purple. So we got full RGB, fair in dynamics, inspired by Razor. It's going to take 12 minutes for headphone firmware. Okay. Okie dokie, our update is done and we're good to go. Let's have a look through some of the settings here. Yeah, we've got voice prompts. So when you basically press this center button, you can get your assistant, you can make calls, all that sort of thing. Now there is a special feature that beyerdynamics is included called enhancement mode, which changes the sound profile a whole bunch, and we'll have a look at that. I'm not sure if labs measured it with that on and off to figure out exactly how that alters it. Oh we've got some statistics, which is always nice to see, how many times it's been turned on, uptime, all that sort of stuff. We have all sorts of remote stuff, which is kind of nice. It gives you a little manual right in the app of what this button does, which yeah it's got a lot of different features. That's kind of cool. Let's get some music into it. I guess we gpt to try and get them in properly and all that sort of thing. Get our volume adjusted. I did have a quick look at the manual and yeah these cables are supposed to go towards the back of the headphones. Let's play some crab rave. Okay. So, yeah, the first impressions are are pretty nice. The seal in my left ear wasn't quite perfect, and this is some of the problem with these in-ear style buds, is that unless you know, you kind of don't know if you have them in right. There's some tutorials in the manual, which kind of go over like if you have no bass response, you've put them in wrong, so you can kind of move them around and feel how the sound changes. Maybe try out some different tips. I think my ears are different so I might need a slightly different like cup for my left ear compared to the right ear. But yeah, the sound is very good. There's something missing though, and I want to just try it again with this enhancement mode off, and we will get a different impression hopefully. Yes, that sounds very, very similar. I think the bass roll off is a little more and the sibilance kind of high-band is a little bit higher. I mean this is probably a good time to talk about the labs results. Yeah, Sam's given me two charts here to have a look at. One of them is from the beyerdynamics, and the other one is from the Apple Air Pods Pro gen two. And we can see that there's a bit of a dip around 200 and some kind of increases. Looks like, wow, five, nearly 10 DB in the three K range. And that's that's kind of where you're getting that (whispering sound) - Kind of sound from the high hats, at least in crab rave. There is a bit of bass push as well, and it's even more pronounced when we have this enhancement mode on. They're kind of not performing at the level I would expect for pair of headphones in this price range, and their are 1200 US dollars, which is a hell of a lot of money. Now, Beyerdynamics does have kind of a characteristic sound where their high-band is a little bit more pushed. It's difficult to kind of recommend something in this price range when there is so much competition in the high end in-ear monitor kind of space. 500 bucks will get you a pair of Shure 535s, which are incredibly robust and well-built little piece of plastic ear junk. I think for these, you're kind of really getting that build quality. And you're also getting the wireless functionality, too, like the Shure 535s. Yeah, they got a wire. You know, you don't get this this nice little band thing. You're not really going to see like a wireless bud performing like this for any other amount of money. It seems to have a lot of really nice features and kind of gives you the prompts. The app is good. This is one product that's not ruined by the software. They've kept it simple, they've kept it, you know, useful it. It gives you a tutorial right in the app of what it does. It gives you lots of control. Let's have a look at the equalizer setting. Yeah we've got bass boost, warm. Yeah. You know all this sort of thing. If we look at the charts that they've given us, we can pretty much fix a lot of the problems with it by just, you know, picking one of their presets. I really would've liked been able to like choose and then we can use the chart that Sam generated to kind of fix all of the issues and then it's perfect. It's got some high-band that's kind of missing a little bit. So if we smooth out the treble and give another listen. (faint upbeat music) Ow. That last one hurt. Um, no. Okay. None of those are good. They don't improve it at all. Maybe that's 'cause I have enhancement on, but yeah, not too sure. They alter the sound too much. It doesn't sound too even. It sounds like the music is wrong, almost. Like there's too much bass, and it's kind of hurting you, or you know there's too much high band, and it's kind of also hurting you, but in a different way. It's not kind of reproducing what the artist intended, and they're classified right on the box is audio file, Tesla in-ear, and I don't like that term. I don't identify as an audio file, and I know some people do, but it's kind of a nebulous term, right? What kind of gear do you want to buy, to make your music sound good? And music sounding good is a subjective thing. I've already forgotten that I'm wearing them. Even with the kind of few ounces of weight that they have. I'm not worried about losing them. I can take them out, I can just dangle them around my neck because of the silicon. I'm not worried about it kind of slipping off the side. It has a bit of memory, so it kind of holds itself in this C-shape. But yeah, it's difficult to kind of articulate why they're not at the level that I think they should be. And I guess that that's kind of a point for the headphones as well, if I can't properly describe why they're not good. Some of them are extremely obvious what the problems are. I think for me my taste is that they have too much bass, and the high band's too much, but that's kind of a hallmark of Beyerdynamic headphone. Looking at the graph there is a noticeable dip the 3000 Hertz, which again is going to kind of maybe cause the issues that I'm looking at. A lot of singers and vocals and a lot of instruments sit around that band. Air Pods, I hate to say it, but I would prefer to buy like four pairs of Air Pods 'cause I'm going to lose them rather than get these. If I were to class these in what I think the price bracket should be, I would say maybe 300 to $400. That kind of, 300 to $500 range of headphones is where you get a lot of choice, and a lot of really good performing headphones. For these, these sound like $400 headphones, and they look like jewelry. I think that's pretty much where this product is going to be classified. But if they were 400 bucks, I think I would use these as my daily driver, you know, on the bus, on the train. They're cool. I think they look nice. I think they sound nice. They fit really well in the ears. You get a bunch of different ear cups to fit them exactly to you. Yeah, they're good. They're good.

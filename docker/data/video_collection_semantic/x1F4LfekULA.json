    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine. And I am so excited, because today I'm actually at the Microsoft lounge, and we have a bunch of new Microsoft goodies that we're going to check out today. There's two that I'm very, very excited about. Number one is the new Surface Duo 2. The first version of this thing, I was such a huge fan of, and the updates that they've made in this version 2 are so exciting. There's also something new in the lineup. And this is something that looks really incredible, I'm so excited to show it to you guys. It's the Surface Laptop Studio. Come on, let's go check it out. So here's everything new that was announced. This is the Surface Laptop Studio. You've got the Surface Duo 2. This is the new Pro 8. This is the Go 3, and the upgraded Pro X. This is also something that's really exciting. This is their Ocean Plastic Mouse. So this is using recycled plastic from the ocean. It hasn't actually been unboxed yet. So, maybe, I'm getting some nods that I can unbox it. This is something else that they announced. This is the Microsoft Surface Adaptive Kit. So this is allowing for all of these devices and any other devices that you might have at home to become more accessible. Dude, these Surface Duos, I'm so excited about this. I feel like all of the things that we felt were not quite there in the first version, they addressed all of that, including the cameras. We've got the wide, ultra-wide, and telephoto, and there's even one on the inside. Do you guys remember, you had to do kind of like this little weird kind of maneuver to, like, flip this over to try to get a shot. But now, they've got cameras not only on the back, but one on the front as well. One of the things that I really like is, oh my goodness, it's happening. This is a new notification spine. So one of the things that was difficult before is you didn't know what was actually happening inside. But now, I can tell I'm getting a phone call. Hello? Extended warranty. Like, if I want an extended warranty, like, I'm going to go to the dealership and I'm going to get it myself. Anyway, the notifications are so cool. So if I click this, I can actually see the time, and I can see the little phone call notification right there. I also feel like it's so subtle that no one's actually going to know that I'm looking at my phone and checking the time. Can you tell. - [Woman] I can tell. - You can tell? - [Woman] Yeah. You can tell looking at your phone. - Okay, shoot. (Justine laughs) But they don't know what I'm looking at. They've also made the screens a little bit closer, so it does feel like it's more of a seamless experience when you're switching from side to side. I like the new camera as well. So we have the ultra-wide, the 1X, the 2X. And it's cool because this all shows up here on the left side. So I'm able to go in and edit. They have an all-new editing feature here. Aspect ratio, different adjustments, like exposure, brightness. You can pop a filter on there. Look at that, that's art. (indistinct) isn't enough to you. Check this out. This turns into, like, a little controller. I love Minecraft engines so much. This game is so fun. So this is the Surface Laptop Studio, and this is something that I'm really excited about because this really is kind of, like, an all new way of not only consuming content, but creating content and working. So this goes into three different modes. We've got our laptop, we've got our stage, and then we have our studio. This is also running Windows 11, so you'll notice that the user interface is now centered. And there's now even the new slim pen with haptic feedback. And the first time that I tried this, it was wild. I was drawing, but it was actually like I was drawing on some sort of paper. So, like, the pen, it's crazy. It's hard to explain. It's like giving a little vibration. So you can tell that you're drawing. - [Man] Are you saying it feels like a friction? - Yeah. It feels like I'm drawing on paper. You could also use the new pen on the Surface Duo 2, which is exciting. So this is the new Pro 8. And they've got a nice little secret spot here for the new Slim Pen. This also has faster connections with Thunderbolt 4 ports. This actually has up to 27% faster CPU, so this is one of their most powerful Pros ever. So there's only one, and Jen and I are both making a video, so we decided to unbox the Ocean Plastic Mouse together. Okay, Jen. Pull the tab. - [Jen] Nice. - Oh, it's so neat. This is really cool. - [Jen] That's one of my favorite colors. - Yeah, whoa, wow. - What's really cool is that all of these will have a unique design since they are made from recycled plastic. This is awesome. I really like it. I like the size too. I feel this is a good travel mouse as well. Well this was just a quick first look at some of the things that Microsoft announced. I'm so excited, I'm such a huge fan of all of the Surface products. And man am I hype about this Surface Duo 2. I can't wait to actually get my hands on one of these and really get a chance to test it out. If you guys haven't already, be sure to subscribe, hit the bell to be notified when I post new videos, and leave me some comments below and let me know what was the coolest thing that you saw today? Bye. (casual uplifting music)",

    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine. And today, we have got some of the Microsoft goodies that were just announced. I was there in New York for their big press event. So today, we're gonna be checking out the new Microsoft Surface laptop, this is the 15-inch, and the new Microsoft Surface Pro with their new red type color and their new, they're calling it a Stylet, a Pen Stylet. Stylet, that just sounds cute. We'll be checking in with my sister a little bit later because she has the 13-inch Sandstone version, so I would love to do a little comparison of these side by side. But first, let's unbox. Tech-tober is here, and it is great! So this is the Surface Laptop 3. That's 256 gigs of storage and 16 gigs of RAM. You know what I haven't done in a while? Smelled the tech that I've been unboxing. I'm not sure when I stopped doing that, but for some reason it's been a while. You guys know I'm a huge Apple fan, but honestly Microsoft Surface has been doing a really great job at everything that they've been coming out with for the past couple of years. If I'm a fan, you know it's legit. Like their design, like everything. It just looks, like, look at this! Oh my goodness. They're making such a big deal about this design because it's so easy to open, and there isn't a little finger flap, so you just, like, it just opens. (gasping) I couldn't see what this was, I thought it was already on 'cause it has the instant on feature, so when you open it, it just automatically turns on. This looks good, oh boy. One of things I also liked about these is they make them easy to access the internal configurations, so if you do need to get an upgrade, or it needs to be serviced, it's not a crazy ordeal, like, it's something that's super easy. I don't think that, that means that you're supposed to do it yourself, I think that means you have to take it to somebody like Microsoft to do it for you, but if you know what you're doing, have at it. Just making sure there's no other secrets. (sniffing) Oh my God, that smells like donuts. So, it looks like we have a USBC, a regular USB, and a headphone jack. I like that it is super minimal. I mean, that's really all you need. And, of course, over here we have our charging port. - [Computer] Hi there, I'm Cortana, and I'm here to help. A little sign-in here, a touch of Wi-Fi there, and we'll have your PC ready for all you plan to do. - Even though I've done this set-up-- - [Computer] Use your voice or the keyboard along the way. - So many times, it still gets me every time. - If you want me to. - So, I think I'm gonna set them both up at the same time. (upbeat music) (plastic tearing) So, this has a 10th-gen Intel Core i5 Processor with 256 gigs of storage and eight gigs of Go RAM. They have a lot of really great accessories too, like the Arc Mouse, which I had covered in my video that I made before. (paper tearing) Look at that. Okay, we're gonna set these both up at the same time. - [Computer] Use your voice or the keyboard along the way. (gasping) I forgot about my Surface Style. (Screaming) (laughing) I smashed my finger, I smashed my finger. I didn't think that it was gonna close, I was just trying to move it out of the way. Oh my God. The username or password is incorrect, well let me try it again. So, I'm not really a huge fan of the color red, but I feel like this isn't really that red-red, it's more like a burgundy-type color. Welcome to Surface Pen. Look, it's welcoming me. I'm left-handed, are you? Oh yeah, that's beautiful. So, this is pretty great, so if you go faster, it makes the eraser bigger. My gosh, this is so therapeutic. I think, probably, I'll just maybe sit outside and scribble on my Surface when I'm feeling stressed. I'm so talented, I'm gonna print this out. I'll title this, \"Art.\" Your printer needs, it's out of paper! Okay, so I printed one, but then I restarted my computer, and I think I accidentally printed a lot of them. Oh, there's another one. I'm just gonna shut my printer off. I mean, this is art. This is just absolute art, I mean, look at this. Have you seen anything better? Didn't think so. Let's go find Jenna and chat with her and see that Sandstone 13 and a half inch laptop. It looked so good in New York, I can't wait to see it in person. Oh sorry, Picasso. I'm talented. Jenna? (tranquil music) So, back here with my sister, she has the 13 and a half inch Sandstone color of the Surface Laptop, it looks really good. - I know. - I love it. - It's beautiful. - Okay, so I can't turn my neck because I fell asleep on a boat yesterday, and then my neck was like this. - That's what happens when you get old, people! - So, that's why we put you over here. - I'm over here. - 'Cause I can turn this way. (panting) - Do you want me to get it for you? - No, I have it. - I hurt my neck turning very fastly because our friend, Tyler, was in the backseat, and he's behind the camera, and he said something about mac and cheese, and I whipped my neck around, and I also hurt my neck, but I'm better now. I'm healed. - I'm ready to party. - And then, I also just drank a Sprite that was expired from like 2017. I haven't even had a Sprite in 20 years, and that's what I get. - That was the last time you've had one. What are we doing today? - Oh, we're gonna be just chatting about our Surface Laptops, and I also have the Surface 7 with a matching Stylet. - Oh, brag-y. - I thought we would do a little drawing challenge. - Oh no. - It'll be kinda like Charades. - Okay. - Do you remember when I drank this, and it's from 2017. - Yeah, don't drink that. - So, to start off our drawing challenge, Jenna's gonna go first, Tyler's going to text her something to draw, and then I'm gonna guess what it is. - Oh my gosh, this is very exciting. I think Tyler's thinking of what to text me. - I see him thinking. - 'Cause I'm a really, I'm a really bad artist. - No, you're fine. - No, no. I don't know how to draw that. Like what's it look like? How am I supposed to draw that? - [Tyler] That's not my problem. - It's not his problem! - Oh my God, Tyler! - Elephant. - I haven't drawn anything yet. - Macaroni and cheese. Pot, cauldron, martini. - Am I supposed to say things? That's a bad drawing. Oh, I wanna start over. Look at all this space I could've been utilizing. Tracer, if you turn it over, it's incredible. Okay, alright. - Martini. - Shut up! I didn't tell you to shut up, this is part of the game. (laughing) - Oh, that's even, that's the thick boy. - Wow, thick. - Starting right now. - Normally there's a timer, but I think at this point. - Okay, let's start, I'm ready now. - Okay. - Okay, ready? - Martini. Ice cream martini, chocolate martini, Matty martini. - Oh, I need to add a color. - Macaroni martini. - Macaroni machete, macaroni drowning, macaroni, this is-- - Guys, I don't like drawing! - Spider, worms, banana. - Let's see, what do they look like? - They? Meal worms, machete, macaroni-- - Okay, this'll help. - Goldfish. Shrimp cocktail! - Yes! This is like if a newborn just straight came out and you gave it a Surface, and was like, \"Here, draw.\" I'm so bad at-- - You're done now, you don't have to draw anymore. - That was two minutes wasted of our lives we'll never get back. - I can't believe what I just-- - I'm not that bad. It's definitely not the best thing I've ever, I told you I'm bad at this, like this is, I had to look it up a picture. - Shrimp cocktail. - I don't eat shrimp, why would I know what that looks like? - My computer's still updating, so as soon as we update, it'll be my turn. - See you got it, you're like, \"Shrimp cocktail.\" - I was like, \"Yes.\" - I know. I know. - The lines really helped. - It did, it really did, and then I realized that those were eyes. You are absurd. - Do they have eyes? - They have eyes. Oh yeah, they have eyes. - I don't eat meat or fish, so. How do we win the game? - (stuttering) I don't know. My Surface is all updated, and I'm ready to draw for Jenna. - It can't be anything worse than what I did. - [Tyler] Are we still doing the food category? - If you wanna pick a new food, or we can even-- - Do we keep it fair? - Yeah, maybe keep it fair, I guess. - Okay. - Jenna likes food. - [Tyler] Food. - You like, you've been looking for candy. - That's why I drank a spoiled Sprite 'cause I wanted a sweet. (laughing) I wanted a sweet. - It's probably very flat. - [Tyler] Okay, I texted you. - Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. - Oh! - Oh my gosh. Okay. - I hope it's like pizza, but that's way too easy. (screaming) Banana. Circle, oatmeal, potato chip. (clicking) French fry, waffle fry. Potato chip. - Absolutely not. - Pringle. - Oh, that's the wrong color, wrong color. - Is it something I would eat? A pickle, a leaf. - (laughing) Okay, maybe I'm not good at drawing either. - Pea. (laughing) Corn, I see it now. Corn on the cob. Corn! - This was really bad. - It looked like Matty's toy. - It's really not good. - He has a corn. - [Tyler] What the hell? (laughing) - It's really bad. - I can't laugh, I have a pain in my neck. - [Tyler] That's not even on a cob! - Dude. - Yeah, it is. - Shrimp cocktail is way better. - [Tyler] It's still in its husk. - That was really bad. - Okay, but she couldn't get it. What else is-- - 'Cause it looked like a potato chip, without the green, it looked like a potato chip. - It kind of looked like a buttered bun. - No, it looked like-- - I got super hyped about the buttered bun. - If you hit back, it looked like a potato chip. - Cherries. - I didn't do anything yet. - A cherry pie, cherry biscuit, a Triscuit. - So, it's hard to draw 'cause that's white, obviously. We can't draw white on white. - Why are you trying to draw white on white? - Shut your mouth. - Cherry, kale salad, cesar salad, chili, chili stew, pot pie, bacon, skillet, camping, potion, sushi. (cheering) - I was gonna draw a fish. - Those are chopsticks. - Yeah. (laughing) No, you don't. - Yeah, you do. - I'm sorry, how else do you draw a sushi? - Oh my God, Jenna has never had sushi. She's barely even seen sushi. - Yeah, I've never had, you keep getting me with the fish. - Like a little, maybe like a little spicy tuna action. - Okay, now Tyler has to think of another food group. Are you looking on google the food to cheat. - I know what a lot of food looks like, I'm a very cultured world traveler. - Maybe I'll just draw spaghetti just for fun. (upbeat music) Salmon, a hat. - (laughing) This is actually really bad. - A ham, turkey. - I don't even know what it looks like. - It looks like Smokey the Bear's hat. - I should probably stop. - A hamburger, cheeseburger, grilled cheese, tomato soup. - I'll just start over. - We're done, I started over. Okay. - New picture. - Why am I so, I can't even draw a circle. - A circle, pumpkin pie, pie. Pie, is it pie? Is that a type of pie? I'm gonna go with a type of pie. Soup, pot hole, chicken pot pie. (laughing) Yeah? - I can't, it hurts so bad, I can't even move. - Can someone say yes or no? (laughing) - Wait 'til I show Tyler my picture. (laughing) - What is it? - It's a pot pie. - No way! - I'm crying. - Good thing that we can communicate telepathically, or else we would've been here for a very long time. - [Tyler] Justine's crinkly pot pies. - I feel so awful right now, I can't feel my neck. - I don't even know what a pot pie looks like, I've never had one. I've never had meat. - Okay, but you could be a vegetable pot pie. - No, fairly, what does a pot pie look like? - Oh my God. 'Cause that's terrible. - Call the freaking ambulance, I have a problem. - Pot pie! - [Tyler] It looks like a child tried to draw a planet. (laughing) - Oh my gosh. - Honestly, that was like record time, I could have been here a really long time. - I know, I think you probably won. So, Jenna won. - Yeah, I think I won. - Honestly, I mean. - This is cool. - Your illustrations were actually better than mine. So, one of my favorite things about Windows 10 is you can play a lot of Xbox games. So, they have cross compatibility with a bunch of titles, and you can also hook up an Xbox controller. So, the new Xbox Elite Controller came out. I dint do an unboxing of this, so I thought I would tie-in, oh God. I have a pain. So, I thought that I would tie-in an unboxing to my Surface video. (laughing) I'm gonna be in like a physical therapy room for my next video because I'm not well. - At least you could play games and work on your drawing. - I still have tears in my eyes from this pot pie. Like, you're incredible. - No, I'm just, I can read peoples' mind. I mean, no I can't. Don't ask me about my special talents. - So, let's take a peak at this. I'm so excited about this, we saw it at E3. Oh, look at this. Jenna already has hers unboxed. - I know, I'm super brag-y. - That kinda defeats the purpose. Oh, look at this. I love this. So, you can charge it while it's in the case. - I didn't know that. That I did not know, so I'm actually, wow. - Yeah, cool design. - Cool, should I put mine back in? - Oh my God, it looks so great. I mean, the first one was so incredible, and then-- - That makes sense. I took it out of the case 'cause I didn't realize you could charge it in the case. - Yeah, it's pretty cool. Alright, well we're gonna play some games on Jenna's channel for her Surface video, and-- - We're gonna play one game. - We're gonna play one game on Jenna's channel for her Surface video, so make sure you guys go ahead over and check out hers. She does an unboxing of this little Surface right here. - It's already opened. - I keep wanting to call it blush, so I've had to edit out so many times of myself calling it a blush color, but it is Sandstone. - Yeah, it's beautiful. - See you guys later, and if you ever want me to draw something for you, I'm starting a commission page. I think that it's really something that you should get as a gift for your loved ones. Okay, bye. It's a really bad pain, I think I have a bad injury. - You want me to. - Oh, and I even took Advil, so like nothing has helped. Okay, I guess we can stop the video now. Oh my God I'm so...",

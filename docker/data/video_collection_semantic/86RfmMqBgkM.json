    "transcript": "- We're at the Mini's Forum booth at Computex 2023, and I don't know how they keep doing it, but I saw the last one. I was like, this is a Mac Mini Killer. It's cheaper than the Mac Mini. It's faster than the Mac Mini. And you know what? They have another one that is basically the same price as a Mac Mini with no storage and whatnot, but it is even more faster. It's got RDNA3 graphics and Zen 4 cores that turbo to over 5 Gigahertz in a box. It's an eighth of a shoebox. That's how small this thing is, and we're gonna tear it apart. We're gonna see how fast it goes, assuming we can get a monitor from ASUS, shout out to ASUS. The last one we checked out was called the UM773. Well, this is the UM790 Pro. On the front, we've got a power button, two USB4 40 Gigabit ports. Is that microphone? Microphone, headphone, combo jack. There's a little reset button. And then I assume that's a power indicator. On the side, mesh because this is a 54-watt max TDP CPU which is actually the same amount of power as the littler one that we looked at. But it's Zen 4. It's RDNA3. It's going to be quite a bit faster. On the back, the thing that I love about these miniforums things, there's just so much I/O. It's kind of ridiculous. I talked about it in the AVerMedia thing that you could use this as a streaming PC. You seriously, seriously could. 2.5 gigabit LAN, always nice to see. This time, we have two USB HDMI 2.1 ports which was a bit of a gripe on the last one. Hopefully, we can actually do high refresh rate output, but the monitor that ASUS has found now is ProArt. So I don't know if it's high refresh rate. It's probably not high refresh rate, right? It's probably 60 hertz. Okay, well, that's fine. Having any monitor is better than nothing. (laughs) For power, it's a 19-volt power brick. We had a bit of a last-minute tragedy. They don't have the power brick for this thing, so I sent Sasha on a wild goose chase to find a 19-volt power brick which conveniently is a kind of a standard for monitors and laptops. And they did find one, but it's only 90 watts, and they were saying that the usual power brick for this is 120. I'm hoping because it's 55-ish watts, that will be okay, but we're just gonna have to wait and see 'cause there is still storage and stuff to consider. On the side over here, we've got a bunch of 10-Gig-type A ports which is again, awesome, lots of I/O. That's pretty much it on the outside, sleek packaging. The outside of this one is a nice kind of, it looks like a sandblasted, kind of aluminum finish. It feels a lot more premium than the other one and to be fair, there is a bit of a price premium, but you're getting a lot more performance. And there is a lot more interesting stuff going on inside. So why don't we crack it open? It comes off. It's sticky. Oh my god, I said this in the last video. I really think that these shouldn't be sticky. They should have some other way to mount 'cause then you can't reuse it. It's fine. You can buy this thing as a bare bones kit with no RAM and no CPU. This one has 32 Gigs of RAM and 512 Gigs of storage, but on their website, you can configure it as high as 1 Terabyte with 64 Gigs of RAM or as low as 16 Gigs of RAM with 512 Gigs of storage. Oh, look at that. Okay. There's a little cable. Oh, there's two cables. Oh, there's many cables. I guess this thing has two fans, actually. This is the fan on the back, and there's a completely different fan for the cooler. This fan and heat sink is to cool the M.2 SSDs. There's a fan in here and a heat sink, and then thermal pads. Okay, I got the fan cable, but there is also Wi-Fi antennas, but they're underneath the SSDs, 512 Gig Gen 4 Kingston Drive. And what you might notice, there's two Gen 4 slots instead of just one. That means in theory, you could run RAID 0 which would be kind of insane on a device like this. I probably wouldn't recommend that. Or RAID 1, so you could have a little bit of, I guess sort of redundancy in your boot drive, which is always nice. Although RAID 1 is usually not too heavy because there's not really any parody data to calculate, so it's probably okay. Over here, we've got a slot for the Wi-Fi card. Oh my god, this does support USB-C power. Does this support USB power? No. We spent so much time trying to find a power brick. Oh my god. Okay. I don't even have time to be like distraught. That's great though. I mean you can run it on type C. I have 140-watt power brick in my bag. We should use that. Then we can use the high refresh rate monitor, 140-watt, we're good. (calm jazzy music) - Thanks to Sweetwater for sponsoring this video. When we need to upgrade our audio gear at LMG, we can count on the fine folks at Sweetwater to carry the latest and greatest. Whether it's mics, headphones, sound mixers, pre-amps or cowbells, they got everything you need more of. Not sure what products you need? Use the comprehensive resources on their site to help guide you or speak to a Sweetwater sales engineer for personalized gear advice. Sound clearer, crisper, and cleaner with Sweetwater. Check 'em out at the link below. - All right, for RAM, we have our two 16 Gig sticks because this is N4, this is should be DDR5. Let's put it back in. There's two sticks. They're both removable, so you totally can service this thing. You totally can upgrade this thing. Speaking of the CPU, it's a Ryzen 9 7940 HS which is kind of like a mobile laptop SKU. Eight core, 16 thread, base clock of four gigahertz, and turbos to a max of 5.2 which is kind of ridiculous. It is configurable TDP, so 35 watts to 54 watts. They put this little plastic piece on there to protect the antenna connectors. So stupid people don't rip them off when they're taking it apart. This is very smart. Let's start going further. They're all looking nervous now. It still seems very in there. Hmm. Oh yeah, there we go. It's just the ports kind of hold it fitted in there. Oh my god, it's so close. Yeah, I give up. I chipped the edge of the PCB. There's nothing there, but I give up. We have nine minutes to put it back together, boot it into Windows, try to, I don't know, probably not play a game. The Internet's too slow to play a game here, but we can at least run Cinebench or something. Let's see if it still turns on. On the website, it says PDN. Let's try it. It's lit up. Hopefully, this cable doesn't light on fire. It's 140-watt brick, so it should be okay. For some perspective of the performance of this processor and everything, compared to the UM773 that we looked at before, it's 15% faster, single-threaded and around 20% faster overall. Look, it's booted into Windows. Look, just like that. The USB power works and if you wanna compare it to like a desktop CPU, it's about couple percent slower than a 13600K of single-threaded which is kind of mind blowing. I mean, look at this, 13600 K is 125-watt TDP CPU that really runs at more like 200 watts. So this is kind of nuts. Okay, can we get high refresh rate? If we can't, it's definitely not the monitor's fault, I assure you, unless Sasha brought me a bunk monitor. Oh, my god. 1080p 240, no way. Look at that. This thing is tiny. Oh, my God. Why'd you bring me a 1080p monitor? What the hell? (laughs) I'm just kidding. It's actually good because this system is, you would want a game at 1080p if you're gonna game at all. Okay, let's get Cinebench. These downloads are not stressing the Wi-Fi 6E Killer chip in here at all. We're probably getting like one megabyte down for sure. Oh, no, 2.5. That's not bad. And we're downloading Steam at like one megabyte a second. Oh, god. Oh, god. That's not a good sound. That says, we're-closing-the-convention-hall type of sound. We're downloading stuff right now too. This is not a perfect science by any stretch of the imagination. Five gigabytes a second, sick. So it looks like read speeds sequentially. About five gigabytes a second read, 3.5 gigabytes a second, right? You could probably go faster if you put a faster SSD. This is just like a Kingston-OEM kind of SSD. Let's see how fast our memory's running at, 5,600, look at that. And there's our CPU. Look at all those scores. You can see base speed, four gigahertz. And we're running at 4.25 right now, which is pretty cool. All right, Cinebench, let's go multi-core. Let's watch the power, 55. Look at that, 54 watts. It's the full TDP. It doesn't even care. We're barely cracking, like 70-something degrees. Yeah, full power CPU, 54 watts. That's a lot. Lot of power in a little package like this. This is a really hard area to evaluate noise because this, they're playing music like, get the hell out of the convention center. But I'm trying to hear it. You can hear it. You can definitely hear it. It's kicking off a lot of heat. It's definitely ripping. If you look at the core temperatures, the hottest core got up to 76 degrees Celsius, and it still really wasn't that loud. Look at that score. It is as fast as a first-generation Threadripper, 16 core faster than a 7,700K by almost three times that. Literally, these cores, there's half of them, remember? As this Threadripper, they are twice as fast. Given that there is half of them. This is ridiculous. Yeah, look at that. Okay, it's 4,000 single threaded which is about the same as a 13600. It's also about the same as a 13700. The CPU score, almost 31,000 multi-threaded It's very, very fast. I think that's a pretty close to a 12700 K, which is, this is mind boggling because this is so small. We can run 3D Mark, I guess. It's a GTX 780, scores about an 8,000 in this test. This scores about a 7,700, so it's kind of in the the range of a GTX 780 which is an old card, but this is also basically integrated graphics in a tiny PC. So if your 780 could run it, this probably can. I like the last one 'cause it was so cheap. This is still pretty inexpensive when you consider the performance, and it's got a nice aluminum chassis. It's sick. I love mini PCs. I seriously think that with a USB capture card, this could be a sick streaming PC. I'm sure you could game on it, too, RDNA3 graphics. I really did wanna try that. But regardless, check them out on the link of the description. You can buy it bare bones, you can buy it with RAM, you can buy it with SSDs, whatever you want. You can get two SSDs if you want. If you liked this video, like it, get subscribed, check out the course there, or the AVerMedia short circuit. I just did a combitext and yeah, subscribe 'cause we will have more combitext videos.",

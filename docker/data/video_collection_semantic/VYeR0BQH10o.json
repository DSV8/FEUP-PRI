    "description": "This little adapter allows your iPhone 7 to charge while listening to 3.5mm (standard headphone jack) headphones. Yes this is the same functionality as the official iPhone 7 dock from Apple but this contraption allows the iPhone 7 to be handled during charge / listen functionality.  Here is the ILDOCK Kickstarter page -   From the manufacturer -  By now, everyone has seen many jokes and videos made about the lack of phone jack on iPhone 7. You could put a 3.5 mm to a lightning adapter, but that would mean you cannot charge the phone at the same time.  ILDOCK contains a 3.5 mm headphone jack and a lightning charging port, enabling you to listen to music and charge your iPhone at the same time.  Not only is ILDOCK the first to offer you 3.5 mm + lightning port, but it is also the best looking iPhone dock. We use aircraft grade aluminum and precision CNC to create ILDOCKs beautiful look that will match your iPhone.

    "transcript": "So you got the new iPhone7/7 plus. You're feeling a little bit nostalgic. You're missing something that existed on the previous edition of iPhone and every single iPhone before that. And you know what I'm talking about. I'm talking about that 3.5 millimeter headphone jack goodness! But you haven't stopped thinking about that. Every night, you go to bed, you put your head down on your pillow and you think about those better days... The golden years. Legitimately, like, golden.... This guy hit me up and said- I don't know, I think he's got a Kickstarter going on. I have a link to what he's doing down in the description. But he was like, \"I got this little thing for you, Lou. To solve the world's problems once and for all!\" Let's get into this rather rudimentary packaging here. Oh, that's ti- that's much smaller than I expected it to be, that's tiny. The IL dock. \"Ill dock.\" \"Ill dock!\" Like is that \"the\" in some language \"the dock\"? I don't know. Look at this little thing! Now a lot of you are thinking, \"But Lou, inside the box, Apple they included an adapter for once, in the box!\" Well, you're right, they did. There's a problem with that adapter. That adapter takes your lightning port and gives you a headphone jack back, but what it doesn't do, it doesn't give you this. It doesn't give you a lightning port pass through. Let me set the stage, let me give you a scenario. Say you're a kid, you're lying in bed all right, you got your favorite headphones on. You've been using these for years and you don't want to switch. Now you got your phone. All right, this new iPhone 7, you love it. It's got a great camera. You go to do this, and that's not happening, so maybe you reach for the Apple adapter, but then you plug that baby in and then you're like, \"That battery is getting low, because of watching Netflix.\" And anyone who's ever watch video on the phone before-- (phone ringing) Ryan again! So, the battery is the next thing to worry about. Now! You got both with this little guy right here, you're now charging and using your favorite headphones. Look at that! Who's better than you now? Now you're like this hours, days go by. Months! You might grow a beard like this, you start to see a gray hair pop up in there! That could be you! Let me do a little test. Let's make sure this actually works. The moment of truth... Boom! We are now in the magical land of charging and listening at the same time. Another thing that came to my mind when I saw this straight away was: people who sampled sounds off their phones, DJs things like this where you're constantly using this mini jack connector, but at the same time your phone might need to be powered up if you're pulling files from it on a regular basis. Now, granted, I do want to put a disclaimer in here. This little dock doesn't really do anything that the Apple dock doesn't do. Yes, it has a lightning pass through. Yes, it has a mini jack connector for audio. BUT! Only while the phone is docked and upright. Now, what if you want to use the phone while it is connected? You see what I'm saying? Can't do that with the official dock. Let me just make sure the audio functions the way I want it to as well. Oh, there's a great suggestion! Wouldn't want to miss this one! There's a lot of people who use a traditional stereo with their iPhone. Maybe, you got one of these guys. (music) Enough people were talking about it. Enough people wanted a problem solved and here it is! Probably the best solution I've seen: Charge, Listen: Same time! Could always switch to Android, too.",

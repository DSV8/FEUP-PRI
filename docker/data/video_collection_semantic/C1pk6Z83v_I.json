    "description": "Giving away 700 SoundCore bluetooth earbuds HERE:   (Plus 10,500 discount codes.)  Ive tried so many different wireless headphones over the last few years. And with more and and more phone companies getting rid of the headphone jack... wireless is going to be the way of the future. In this video we tear down some of Ankers brand new SoundCore bluetooth earbuds to see if their claim of 'Most sweatproof headphones' is valid.   True waterproofing needs to have a coating covering the circuit board, and the only way to find out for sure... is from the inside. Luckily I know a guy who likes to take things apart. Me.

    "transcript": "I've gone through about 15 different pairs of Bluetooth headphones in the time since smartphones and Bluetooth started being a thing, and not all of the headphones are winners. I normally wear Bluetooth headphones when I'm at the gym or when I'm running. I have run a couple marathons in the past. So I go through Bluetooth headphones fairly quickly. When I'm purchasing a pair of Bluetooth headphones I look for two things: one is sound quality, obviously, and durability...if it can survive my workouts and long runs. Sweat is probably one of the worst enemies of electronics, not just because it's liquid, it's also salty, which is extra corrosive to the fragile internal circuits. And headphones that stop working are the worst kind of headphones. Anker reached out with two of their brand new sound core headphones for me to try out, saying these things are sweat-proof They have 700 headphones to give away to you guys, along with 10,000 discount codes. So stick around to the end of the video for that information. The best way headphones can truly be sweat-proof is with a coating applied directly to the circuit boards. With the right coating, it should be able to survive all kinds of liquids like soda, sweat, water. And if that coating exists, it would definitely support Anker's claim that these are the world's most sweat proof headphones. The only way to check out for sure, is from the inside. Let's get started. [Intro] So I've had both of these headphones for about 2 weeks now. Anker says these are the world's most sweat proof headphones. It's a pretty bold claim considering how inexpensive they are. The SoundCore Spirit is over here, and then we have the SoundCore Spirit X's over here. The X's have that little ring around the back so it wraps around your ear. The Spirit headphones are just the buds, a long strap, and magnets on the ends to keep them from dangling around. They come with additional earbuds for different sized ears, but I just use the standard ones and they stayed in just fine. The over-ear Spirit X headphones wrap around your ear for the more heavy exercises like sprinting. But the ear wrap around part is super soft, and I've worn them for a few hours at a time with no problem. The SoundCore Spirits are the smaller, round, in-ear headphones with little bits of rubber that conform to the insides of your ear. Taking this review to the inside, we find some sealed plastic, which is good for water-proofing. And then we see the internal rechargeable battery. Taking special care not to puncture the little guy, I'll slice through the outer plastics to reveal the blue 50 or 60 milliamp hour (it's kind of hard to tell at this point) battery tucked up inside. So we've seen the earpiece plastics are sweat-proof, let's jump down to the control circuit. The micro USB charging flap is to help keep liquid and dust out. Peeling off the rubberish buttons that are sealed to the controller, we finally expose the circuit board and immediately see there is a coating on top of the board. The whole thing shines uniformly across the surface. When I jump in with a drop of water though, we see it's not hydrophobic. The water still clings to the board. Anker calls their coating a SweatGuard technology a multilayered nano-coating spray that keeps the metal contacts from corroding or shorting out when liquid is present. It resists both sweat and sea water at the same time. Pretty cool stuff. I'll pop out the earpiece speaker before I move onto the Spirit X's. It's a tiny little guy, completely sealed inside of the plastic housing. I guess it depends on what kind of exercise you're going to be doing with these headphones. If you're going to be doing a lot of sprints, you know, high mobility stuff, the ones that wrap around your ears are obviously going to stay on better than the ones that just go in your ear. But I've been able to run normal distances with these ones just fine. The Spirit X's also have interchangeable rubber tips depending on the shape of your ear. The speaker housing is plastic and sealed shut, water tight. But there is a larger speaker inside when compared to the regular Spirits. Kind of interesting. Probably just because there's more room. If I take my metal pry tool to the battery housing, we pop off the Anker logo to find a 90 milliamp battery powering these headphones. And if we slide down to open up the water tight controller housing, which is rather difficult considering the amount of rubber and glue holding it all together, we see these headphones have the same impermeable nano-coating over the circuits. Still not hydrophobic, but thick enough to keep liquid, and more importantly sweat, from corroding the internals. Are they really the world's most sweat resistant headphones? Only time will tell. But it looks like from the teardown, that there is a coating on the circuit boards and they should be able to hold their own. Unlike my Beats headphones which died 3 times in one year because they didn't have any coating at all on that circuit board. For the price, these are pretty incredible. Remember, Anker is giving away 700 of these headphones and 10,000 discount codes. Pretty sure the giveaway is valid in the UK, the United States, Germany, and Canada. All the official rules and details will be in the video description right below this video. If you have any questions, leave them down in the comments, and let me know what your current favorite song is. I need some more music options. Thanks a ton for watching, and I will see you around.",

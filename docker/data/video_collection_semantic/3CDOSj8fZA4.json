    "transcript": "- I just got back from the neighbors and we got the green light! - God. - $100,000 a year. That's how much they wanted to charge us for a 100 gigabyte link between the studio here and the lab, to which I said, \"Excuse me, pardon?\" I'm gonna run my own cable courtesy of Infinite Cables. How much does this bad boy weigh? - Like 100 pounds. - And how many fiber optic pairs are inside it? - I think it's four pair, so that's eight fibers total. - Conceivably then, we could do hundreds of gigabytes per second assuming we had the switching equipment. - Oww! - Sorry. (laughing) - That's metal, dude. - It's a little stiff because it's actually designed for either direct burial or outdoor applications and the length of it is a whopping 700 meters. That's over 2,000 feet for my yankee friends. - 2300. - The good news is that this green belt goes all the way between the two buildings. The bad news is that a lot of the green is pretty spiky. So, this is gonna be one heck of a ride. And it's brought to you by our sponsor! Smart Deploy! Smart Deploy is now powered by pdq.com and offers zero touch, zero headache PC management for IT. You can deploy windows, apps, and drivers from the cloud with no VPN required and get your free subscription worth over 500 dollars at smartdeploy.com/linus. (upbeat music) Just so I understand the plan a little bit better, we've got this braided sleeving here that is covering our terminated fiber optic pairs. These are very fragile. What that means then is we can either pull it by this, which puts all the strain right here or we can pull it by the armored sheath, but not this part in between. This, we need to be careful with because one break and the whole endeavor is wasted. - Pretty much. - Which would be an extremely sad day. - We could get it re-terminated but, it would still suck. - Yeah, not unless we don't know where the break was. - Yeah. - Shout out Infinite Cables, by the way, for sending this thing over. I thought it was gonna be like thousands of dollars worth of cable. What was it, like 700 bucks? - It was less than 1000 bucks. - Yeah. - What?! - Right? Look at this thing! It looks like it should cost like 10 grand in specialty (mumbling). I mean, is this the point where we just start going? Have we figured out a point? - Checking the invoice here. - Have we figured out a point of interest into our building yet? - Yeah. We're just gonna put it through the door. This is just for temporary. - Through the door? Now, obviously, this kind of a fiber deployment wouldn't be, strictly speaking, official. So, we're just trying it as a proof of concept to see what kinds of speeds we can get and also to demonstrate the benefits of fiber optic cabling over copper. There's absolutely a snowball's chance in hell that you would get any kind of copper signal over this distance at any kind of speed, let alone this speed. - [Jake] Wait, where are you going? - Well, I'm going, right? - [Jake] You gotta go in the bush somewhere. - Well yeah, but we're going through the door here, right? So, I don't need to go through the bush and then we'd have to backtrack to the door. - [Jake] Sure! - All right, here we go. So, what, am I just doing this myself? - [Jake] Yes. - Here's a thing. The weight of this cable is going to be so great once it's fully deployed that we're going to have to have a team of people, probably positioned every 50 to 100 meters to help pull it once we reach the final stretch. (laughing) Uh, okay. This is the back door. I'm assuming we're going in the back door? - [Blonde Man] Oh, we're going in the, wait, what? - We're the back door boys. - [Blonde Man] Wait, what do you mean you're going in the back door? - Like, the, your end will go in here, right? - [Blonde Man] Yeah, but that's the other-- - So then, my end needs to start snakin'. - [Jake] Oh yeah, get on in there, little doggy. - Didn't you say you guys cleared this, Dan? - Uh no, were we supposed to? - Are you serious right now? - We walked it. - There's someone that cleared the other end, I believe. But, this end should be pretty clear just behind the tree line. - Should be pretty clear. Are you listening to yourself? - Yeah, it's behind the tree line. You just gotta crawl through there, it'll be fine. Yeah, don't worry about it. - We changed our mind about going into the bushes any sooner than we absolutely have to. Unfortunately, this is the end of the easy path and there are no shortcuts on the next leg of our journey. This could quite possibly be the dumbest thing we've ever done. - Yeah but it's a ridiculous idea and I think that makes it amazing. It's one of the best projects I think we've done here. - It's like when you're a kid and you imagined what it would be like to have a tin can stretched all the way to your friends house who you could talk to. - Exactly. - This is the high tech version of that. All right, in we go. Ohh, blackberries! This one looks delicious. - This is the first hurdle that we found when we walked this. - Yeah, it's a fence. It's not really a hurdle. It's a fence. - Okay, fine. He's being pedantic. It's whatever it is. - A high hurdle. - High gate hurdle. - It's a high hurdle. - There's gonna be a couple more along the way but this is our first one. - Wait, we have to scale this? Can't we just go around? - I believe there's more fence. - Oh my God, there's a different fence. - I'm stuck. - [Linus] Wait a second. Wait, ohh. Uh, that's gonna be a negatory, chief. Okay, so what I'm gonna do David is, I'm gonna leave you here. And then you're gonna watch me bushwhack my way to you. All right, I'm comin' at ya. You ready? - [David] Yeah? - [Linus] We're goin' charging bull style! Gonna clear a path! - [Jake] How to get seriously injured 101. - [Linus] Here we go! (screaming) Oh no! These jeans have holes! I'm adding holes to my other holes! Here we go, I gotta get low! Oh God, I'm not wearing a face shield. (growling) - [David] Oh my God. Hi, are we just gonna pass it through the fence? - [Linus] What's up? Well that was exciting. All right, so now the plan is we wanna cut these boys as low as possible and get em outta here. That's the secret to bushwhacking. You don't wanna scatter everything around. Actually spent a lot of time doing this stuff for the excellent pay of about two bucks an hour for my parents when I was a teenager. Okay, here's the plan. Dan? - Yeah? - You're gonna clip it to my butt. - Not the weirdest thing I've ever been asked to do. - [Linus] So, we're gonna go right here. Is that, is that kosher? - [Dan] Yeah, I think that's gonna work. Uh, it'll protect it a little more, I guess. - Okay. - [Dan] Yeah, let's do it. - [Linus] And then my goal, as I go, is gonna be to clear you guys about three feet so you can micro-trench it. (intense music) Excuse me, Dan? Did you just call me fat? - [Dan] Yes! - What, why?! - [Dan] You're very quick! - Oh, quick. I thought you called me fat. - [Dan] I also called you fat! - Oh my God. Look, big booty's in fashion, all right? Hey! Well hey, that's not so bad, eh? - Good job. - Are you filming vertically? - [Alex] I am filming vertically. It's a lot easier for this space here. - Alex from logistics is helping us 'cause David can't get back here, okay. You gotta go horizontal. - [Alex] You want me to go horizontal, okay. (laughing) - All right, so can I just start walking? - [Dan] Now you can, yeah! - Oh, heck yeah! Don't mind me, I'm just laying fiber here. Just laying a big, fat fiber right behind myself. (laughing) - Figured we'd give you an update on what actual cable this is while we're pulling here. Unlike what we said before, I don't remember, I think I might have said eight pairs. It's actually six total fibers which means you have three pairs. Each pair is gonna have a transmit and a receive fiber and those are gonna plug into transceivers on either end. Currently, we're gonna be using the hundred gig transceivers and we're gonna use two on either end, which are aggregated together to make a 200 gigabyte length along this cable. But on this fiber, we can even run three 400 gig transceivers for 1200 gigabyte, 1.2 terabyte which is mind boggling. This is future proofing at its finest. I don't think our video productions ever gonna use anywhere near 100 gig, let alone 1200 gig, but we could do it if we wanted. Now, inside the sheathing of this cable, it's like a hard plastic, really strong. You're gonna find like a corrugated metal layer. That's gonna be kinda cut resistant. Even if you were to get through this plastic, there's actual metal in there and it's kinda got a ripple corrugation like this. And then inside that, there'll be like a pull cord and some like, kinda insulation fibery stuff and then, inside all of that, you'll actually see the really small single node fibers. Six of them. It kinda feels like a hose. It's got a little bit of like memory 'cause of the steel but it's really, really strong. We've been reefing on it. David, you wanna look down there? Just this run alone is 150 feet. So, wherever Linus is in the bushes, he's been in there for like an hour now. He's probably gotten ya know, maybe another 200 feet. We've got a long way to go. - [Man] Hello? - [Linus] Hello! - [Man] Can I help you? - [Linus] No, I'm good. Clearing some of the blackberries back here. - [Man] You with the city? - [Linus] No, no, no, but we're running a cable. We have a unit in this building here. - [Man] Oh, perfect. Cut away, my friend. - [Linus] All right. - [Man] We tried to shock em but these things grow like (censored) weeds. - [Linus] Oh, I know right? I could see someone was back here not that long ago 'cause some of the big ones are dead. - [Man] Yeah, we tried to stop it 'cause it encroaches over here like crazy. - [Linus] Well, I'm gonna kill some of em. - [Man] Beauty man, awesome, thanks very much. - [Linus] All right, cool man! Sup Dan? - [Dan] Linus! - [Linus] Welcome to my party. - [Dan] It's pretty cozy back here. - [Linus] How do ya like my path? - [Dan] It's horrible! - [Linus] What do you mean horrible? I actually had one of the buddies who lives over here come out and tell me hey, thanks for clearing some of these blackberries. - Oh, what a nice thing for you to oww! Damn it, for you to do. - [Linus] So, how far along am I? I actually have no context for distance here. - We're technically in the final stretch now. - [Linus] Shut up. - Yeah, so that was the last corner and now it's straight all the way to HQ2. - HQ2 is the lab. That's what logistics calls it 'cause they can't not be, arsed to stick to convention. - Well it's changed like six times, Linus. - [Linus] All right so, I just keep going? - You just keep goin'. Got Alex at that corner. We got Jamie and them at the other corner. I'm gonna film ya now. - All right. - [Linus] Okay, am I sliced up? - [Dan] You're not too sliced up. - Oh okay, I thought you said that was wrong. - [Dan] No, I made it a selfie. - It's all about the technique. If you guys want some bushwhacking tech tips here. Even with big, thick gloves like this, if you just grab onto these things, you're gonna get your hands sliced up something nasty. You can see, mine are fine. The reason for that is that it's all about the grabbing technique. You've been watching me on my chest cam just grabbing these things. But you gotta grab with like a brushing motion 'cause it breaks off the tips of all the ones where your hands are and then you just move these buddies around. Little something like that. No damage to the meat paws. How's the radius on the back of the fiber? - [Dan] Looks fine right now. - Yeah, okay. It's like playing a VR game except the tether costs 700 dollars if you break it. Really coming around. - [Dan] All right, I'm coming through. - You found some pricklies? - [Dan] Oww, I'm much taller than you. - How far you reckon we are? - [Dan] Well, we've got a bit of a gap in the buildings now. So, I think that means that we've only got maybe three more to go. - Ohh! - [Dan] And the last one's ours. - Only three more buildings? - [Dan] Yeah. Well, they're connected together, come on. Linus, I was wrong. - [Linus] What? - [Dan] I was wrong. - What? You, wrong, never. - [Dan] I think we're only at lab one. - We're only, what? So how much farther is it? - Yeah, we've made it-- - [Dan] We've only made it like two buildings. So, we have another four, five, six, seven buildings to go, I think. - Seven? - [Dan] Uh, roughly. And these are the small ones. They turn into warehouses soon, like ours. - All right, cool. - This is neat. Check this out. I haven't done anything here. - [Dan] Oh, it's beautiful. - Not bad, right? - [Dan] Yeah. - So, all we gotta do is give it a little, ohh my neck! Not gonna lie, I'm runnin' outta steam a little bit here boys. - [Dan] Do you wanna tag team? - Serge is gonna be back with a weedwacker, I got this. - [Dan] All right. - I'm not gonna give up now. - [Dan] Linus has taken this all on himself. In the wilds of Langley BC, Canada. We have a Linus Sebastian in its native habitat. - We're gonna need some backup here. Look at the density of this. Hey, Serge! (yelling) Hey! All right, Serge is here. We got, the cavalry's here. Give it a, no no, just chuck it up and over. (mumbling inaudible) Oh God! - [Serge] There's one. - I'm ready, sir! (whirring) Halfway along the final stretch, he said. - [Dan] It might be a little bit more than that actually. - Doesn't feel like much of a halfway point. Honestly, I wish we were back to the brambles at this point 'cause these dead bits of tree are so dense and some of the branches are so thick, I don't even think I could cut them with this. It's gonna be extremely slow going through here. (laughing) I am stepping out into the light. Sup David? 100 meters? Oh, you're close Linus. It's only a frickin' Olympic sprint race away. Dan, are you coming? - [Dan] I'm coming. I'm coming, Linus. - What the hell? How'd you find the easy way? I crawled through all that! - [Dan] What? Oh, it's like this for like two kilometers. - Shut up, it's not for two kilometers. It doesn't even go two kilometers. - [Dan] Oh okay. - Sup YouTube? Oh my ooh. Oh I got myself pretty good there, whoops. - [Dan] Yeah, your neck's uh, don't look at your neck. - Oh yeah, battle scars. Oh good. You should've brought a helmet. It's actually made a big difference. - I should've brought a helmet. I'm in a lot of pain right now. - Oh, hi David. - [David] What's up? - I don't know if they want me pulling the cable or not, but I'm pulling it. Found a path. Do you know what I'm supposed to be doing right now? Wait, nobody's pulling cable anymore? How long, when did everybody go back to the office? David, they're done. They're out, they're gone for the day. - [David] Are you kidding me? - Yeah, nobody told me. - [David] Why? - So we're just standing here like idiots. No, no, it didn't come from me. All right, see ya later. Oh my goodness. This shirt is not dark green, David. I am frickin, yeah, that's the color. - [David] That's the dry spot. - Okay, so it's not super breathable. But, look at this. - [David] Hey! - You guys saw what I was doing in those bushes. This is what the unprotected parts may look like. - [Yvonne] Oh my gosh. Holy cow! Wow! - Workshop jacket, lttstore.com. (laughs) And we're here! Okay, I staged the whole being in the bush thing. I showed you guys as like a clear shot over here from where we left off but, that's okay. I didn't really wanna go in and start bushwhacking again anyway. (grunts) This is it. We're through the door. Lab two! Where are we testing this? - [Dan] Keep going. - Keep going, okay. - Keep going. The switch is over here. - Well I don't, yeah, that's why I asked you where I'm going! I asked you, I asked you where I'm going. You say keep going. I go and you tell me I went too far! This is exactly what I'm talking about. - I didn't hear you. - You didn't, bull (beep) you didn't hear me. Why would you say keep going if you didn't hear me? (groans) One thing I gotta say is this experience has given me a whole new level of respect for the crews that run these fiber lines all over our cities. Like shout out. You guys are doing the lord's work 'cause it is not easy. It's heavy and cumbersome. - Oh, that was only part of the journey. We still don't know if the cable even works. - But first, we're gonna show you guys the switching equipment that we're gonna be using to get our 200 gigabyte link between the two buildings. - You know we could do 300 right? - What, really? - We can do three, I mean there's three pairs. - I'm super down. - (scoffs) I only bought optics for two. - Okay, 200 gigabyte link. This right here is the MikroTik CRS504-4XQ-IN and pretty much, that's all it does. Four 100 gigabyte ports and then you got your management port and that's it. Dual redundant power supplies. - Oh, oh, hold on, hold on. Dual redundant power supplies. - The hell is goes power? - It can also be POE power. It can also be powered by - No way! - DC power if you want. - Shut up! POE power? - Yeah! This switch only draws 25 watts max without optics. 25 watts. - It does, what, and it has four 100 gigabyte links? - Yeah, purpose build hardware baby. - How much is this bad boy? - Guess. - Two grand. - 800 bucks. - Shut up! - Yeah. I've seen them on sale for seven too. - Do you know what I would've given for this when we started this company? - (laughs) Yeah. - Like my parts of my soul. All right actually, we haven't even talked about our optics. Shout out FS.com, by the way. These guys have basically made fiber optic networking affordable and accessible to normal people. - Mmhm. - Like it's intercompatible with all this different gear. You don't have to pretty much worry about proprietary, oh, it doesn't work with this one. - You can go on their website and pick any manufacturer you want and there's actually a box you can get to plug these transceivers in and reprogram them on the fly. - That is so cool. - Yeah, these ones are gonna be two kilometer range. Our run is about 700 meters currently. We add a little bit on the ends and maybe we're at like 800 meters. These might be too powerful. So we're gonna have to use a fiber optic power meter to see what kind of output these are doing because if you have too much power, you can burn out either end. - More is not necessarily better. You gotta remember guys, these are lasers and these are highly sensitive receivers on either side. - You don't wanna go using like a 40 kilometer transceiver on a two kilometer run. Now, you won't do that because they're expensive, but this is the minimum we could get while still hitting our range requirements. - Now, can we get something that will tone her down a little bit? - Yeah, it's called an attenuator. - Beautiful. - It just goes in late. But we'll worry about that for later. It'll be fine to run just a test. - Okay. Where did we leave the cable on this thing? - It's just sitting outside. - I haven't been back here for a while. - Just chillin' out there. - I was busy going through the-- wait, it's just outside? - Yeah! - Jake! - What? - We just left it outside? It's been two days. - What else are we gonna do? - I don't know! - Worse comes to worst, somebody broke it. Oh look, it's still there, wow. - What the hell, dude! It's just in, literally just tossed it in the bushes. - Yeah, so? - Ah whatever, I guess it's a temporary install. - Now the question is, do we wanna run this inside or do we just patch it here? - Uh, I think we can run it inside. Just roll it. - Just roll the spool? - Yeah, we'll roll this monster. - Oh, I gotta tape it. - Let's do it, let's do it! - Oh boy. - This is what we call a Canadian wheel. You just carry it. Where are we going? - To the server room, you know? - Server room? - Yeah, well 'cause we wanna hook it up to the rest of the stuff, right? - I guess so. - [Mark] What's this? - It's water, Mark. It's a series of-- no, don't take off that side. Don't take off that side! - Why not? - 'Cause we still need to pull it through stuff maybe. - No we don't, we're gonna go right there. - Not, I mean later. - Oh, oh, oh. - Take off the other side. Yeah here, just let go. - Oh my God. Oh my God, oh, you just whacked it. - Oh, it's fine. - It's glass. - It's like indestructible glass. It's like corning glass. Do you remember what we did to those? - Is this corning glass? - Yeah! - But is it like the, is it like the very good kind? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! - I think you're making this up. - It is corning glass though. - Yeah I know, but corning makes like durable ones and they make like high performance once. I suspect this is high performance. - It's um-- - Whatever you're about to say, you're pulling out of your ass. So there's no point in even saying it. I don't wanna hear it. - Okay, let's go! - We should definitely pay attention to which ones we're using. - And then we got our. - Gotta make sure we plug in the same ones on the other side. - Well, we'll know real quick. - So we got LC1A, LC1B, and LC2A and 2B, all right? - It's plugged into our 100 gig L switch. So we've got connectivity. - To the rest of the machines on our network and all that. I'd like to just take a brief moment and clarify that we would never recommend doing something like this for any kind of long term deployment. - This is just a meme. It's just for the jokes. We wanted to see if we could do it. - And the cable was shockingly affordable. So we were like-- - Hold that. - Oh my God, could this be done? We needed to film in one of our neighbor's fenced off yards. BC Plant Health Care, they do like arborist work and a variety of other things. We will throw their website up here. So, I had to knock on their door and say, \"Uh hey, here's a weird thing we're doing.\" Hilarious. I walk through the door and one of their workers is like, \"Sup, Linus?\" I guess you're here asking about that fiber run you guys are planning. I watch WAN Show. I'm like, \"Don't worry, I already primed my boss on it.\" You know what they asked for? Screwdrivers and backpacks for all their techs. I was like, ya know what, no problem. We got you. (laughing) - All right. - All right, we ready? - Yeah, it looks like it's blinky blinking, so it's at least connected on this side. Oh, that's not good. - Something I'm finding a little bit confusing, Jake, is oh, well this is not a fourth fiber pair. - No, it's the pull cord. - Ohh! - Just wrapped around here and taped and stuff. - Okay and then this guy right here is just what, like a stiffening rod down the middle? - Yeah, might just be stuck in here. Is it actually going in the middle? - Yeah, it goes down the middle. - Plug it in, I'm plugging it in. - All right, plug it in! - Taking too long. - Oh my God. - Holy (censored), did it work? - Oh my God! (laughing) Look at that! Blinky lights! - Oh man, I was worried - it would be broken. - You see 100 gig right there? - Just like that, eh, it just works. Activity and everything. - Okay, let's check here too. - Okay. - Nice! - No way. - Not only if we were able to leave something like this deployed. Not only could we spend zero dollars per month to maintain it but we could actually have double the link speed of what we were quoted. - Mmhm. Ya know, with this fiber, we could do three times 400 gig? We could be 1.2 terabyte. (grunting) - We stole this computer from the keyboard testing robot. Look at this monitor go. Okay, we're good, we're good. This Ubiquity switch has, ah, here we go, 25 gigabyte uplinks right here. To connect these switches then, we're gonna take our QSFP28 port and we're gonna use a breakout cable that goes to four SFP28 ports. The Q is for quad. So this'll do 100 gig and these SFP28s will do 25 gigabyte. Problem is we don't have that cable. But thankfully, ah, perfect timing. Thanks Dan. - [Dan] And thanks to SF.com. - Yeah, this is the thing I was talking about. One of these to four of those. Neat, right? Plugging into our 10 gig card. I know 10 gig isn't 100 gig. But realistically, with Windows File Explorer, we're not gonna be getting more than that speed to a single client anyway. The reason that we would need a link speed this fat would be because there's gonna be anywhere from 20 to 30 people who are working out of this building right from day one. I don't know what the password is though. I guessed it. (laughing) I hacked the mainframe. Hello again, Manjaro. It's been a while. That's fast internet, look at that, it's snappy. - [David] Do a speed test, mm. Definitely won't be 100 meg. - Yeah, okay, so that's 100 megabytes per second. - [David] Hell yeah, brother. - Okay so wait, why are we using the management port? - Uh because-- - What are we even doing sir? - It's not making a link to that switch. A lot of the times when you're breaking up 100 gig, you have to go on and explicitly tell it, you can break up into four 25 gig links. So, we gotta check this switch and see. - All right. - It's detecting the cable and it's good. I was trying a transceiver that's not necessarily MikroTik compatible earlier and it was exhibiting the same behavior. - Okay, so we'll try the other transceiver and then see how it goes? - Well, this isn't a transceiver. This is a cable. It's like a direct to touch cable. - Oh shoot. So, this, this splitter, oh okay. - It doesn't like the splitter. - Man, I love these like beefy frickin cables here. - You just need a couple conductors. Two 100 gig? - Yeah, these are copper. That's why they're so thick. The other, the fiber one, the reason that's so thick is just from all the armor and protection on it. - The actual fiber in there is like so small you can barely see it. - Yeah. - Do we have a fan anywhere? Oh, isn't there a bunch of Noctua fans? 'Cause this will get hot. - Oh frickin A. All right yeah, one moment please. Unfortunately, we couldn't find any cooling fans here and it's a long walk back to the office. But, we did find this leaf blower. - You're not gonna actually, don't blow it at me please. - Oh yeah, do you mind, Dan? I mean, do you deny that it will keep that network card cool? - As long as you don't blow it at me or in my ear. - I wouldn't blow it at you. Oh, that is pretty hot. Okay, one sec. Let's give her a little uh-- (leaf blower blowing) It's cooled! Look Jake, it's barely warm to the touch now! It's almost like fans cool things. Oh yeah, here we go. - Something's changed. We're on Windows now. We've got a ConnectX-6 card instead of a ConnectX-4. And are we connectX-ing right now? - Let's see, let's see. - We're connectX-ed. - This should be 100 gig. Show me the hundred gig. Come on, come on, come on. (cheering) - All right. - Oh, that's frickin' amazing! - Speed test? - Okay yeah, yeah, first thing's first. We just gotta do like-- like internet speed test. Woo! (laughs) Obviously, this isn't our full 10 gig internet speed but, our speed test servers that are fast enough for us to get that full speed anyway. This is all urban fiber had. They did their best. Now, let's go ahead and why don't we just do like a file transfer, I guess, right? We're using a Sata SSD. I was like oh, why is this speed so unimpressive? I'm only getting 600 megabytes a second. (laughing) Because my local storage operates at like less than a 10th of the speed of my network connection. Yeah, so it went from 700 all the way down to three. This poor SSD. - [Jake] This system is like at 100 % utilization. - This system - is crapping the bed! (laughing) Task manager won't even open. - It's like when your SSD is at 100% utilization though. - Yeah. - Are you ready? - I'm ready. - This is ram disc to server, so, we're about to see the limit of Windows File Transfer. - Should we bring up-- whoa, whoa, let's go! - What, .6, woo! - Hey, it hit 1.7 for a second there. Gigabytes a second. - Wow, okay, let's do something more exciting. How bout this? - I guess well in excess of 10 gigabyte. Even if we had a 10 gigabyte internet connection. - That's well-- - Holy crap, we're at 44, 45 gigabytes per second. This is incredible. Incredible! Like the segway to our sponsor. FreshBooks!

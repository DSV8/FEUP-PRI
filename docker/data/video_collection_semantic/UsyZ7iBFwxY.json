    "transcript": "good people on me tree and The Dygma Raise is one of the coolest gaming keyboards I've come across that promises to improve your typing posture and even if you're not in this hole touch typing using all your basically 10 fingers for typing the midsection around the spacebar is my favorite macro layout that is awesome for typing and gaming it is both intuitive and flexible I've been using the Dygma Raise for the past two weeks improving my type typing technique I'm not exactly there yet I'm still using only two fingers on my right hand for finding certain keys but this thing is quite unique in the world of 60% errs it's currently on the second round of pre-orders with shipping in June and this very high price point is kind of in line to other split keyboard offerings but the nature of something this niche and relatively small production scale attracts a high premium price now one thing that tries to achieve here is to improve your posture and typing Plus gaming performance with a really interesting team behind InDesign with history and eSports and really wanting to offer an ergonomic gaming solution that doesn't exist yet so here is my review of the Dygma raise keyboard that feels very well thought out it might as well be worth the asking price say hello to proper airflow would be quiet pure bass 500 DX a compact mid Tower with a mesh front panel and 3 140 moomin are pure wings two fans that are silent and capable enjoy tasteful a RGB illumination a type C port and an easy case to work in check it out below let's start from the beginning as the keyboard because of its unique shape comes in a nice carry pouch with a handle and it's fairly hard to we have extra cables to extend the reach of each side and more on that later some stickers adhesive and washable wrist pads that match the color of black or silver and finally there's a key cap switch puller and this triangular type C module called neuron that makes the split functionality of this keyboard possible Dygma calls the brain of the keyboard where your profiles are stored and to my surprise it is also RGB it splits the signal to left and right with braided type C cables meaning you have the full flexibility on how far and what angle each keyboard side is positioned thus promising a more comfortable typing experience and this means your hands aren't normally crammed into the center of a keyboard and instead flare out as wide as you're comfortable with even shoulder-width apart creating a lot of the center space in the middle and that might be really good for Mouse if that's comfortable for you the left side can act as a game pad if you disconnect the right and given the almost symmetrical right side this should be fine for lefties too once you remap the keys so that's basically the ergonomic element of the raise if you're into touch typing you should find yourself nicely at home especially once you reconfigure this and kind of retrain your fingers and even after two weeks I'm still not a hundred percent there yet I'm only utilizing two my fingers on the right hand and my left is perfectly comfortable being in that section the built-in wrist rest helps to flat out my wrist but the same can be achieved with the wrist rest and a regular keyboard once you angle it but what I find a bit ironic here is that there's no way to actually raise or angle the keyboard so it's pretty low profile they are still prototyping with small legs that can angle the race for more ergonomic fit but your purchase today would most likely not have this as the product still undergoes development and I feel like this is kind of a big deal as you cannot raise the raised keyboard the footprint of the raise on your desk is as wide as a 65% keyboard given how the rest rest flares out but it's still quite a bit smaller than a tiki off format what I appreciate here are the mechanics behind the split you can pull apart the keyboard with a little jiggle as tubes on each side connect with a tight fit and there are magnets to that create a good seal now there's a bit of play in the center but nothing to worry about when the keyboard is flat on the table and they really don't mess around with the design either the under glow spans the entire perimeter of each side with beautiful uniform soft diffusion I think the raise looks fantastic and split mode and as a unit the brushed aluminum plate on the silver keyboard looks awesome it hides all the finger marks while the bottom is plastic to allow that model name shine through making the bottom of the race the prettiest keyboard bottom ever it's not necessary but the detail is pretty cool the key caps here are double shot DBT with a beautiful simple font and a smoother texture that I'm used to with PBT and of course we have multiple options for mechanical switches with cherry and kale options available as the keyboard frame is hot swappable which is a must for product of this caliber letting you customize the keys to exactly what you like I got the kale copper switches because I love tactiles and the shorter actuation point at one point one millimeters just feel amazing and since the 60% layout is standard aside from the space bar area you can obviously swap out the key caps for another set but let's talk about why that mid section is so special so for one instead of just one space bar we get eight separate keys and the very bottom row is using low-profile kale switches for extra economics so your thumbs can be in charge of all types of additional functions I will mention to be careful with the key caps on the low profile switches because I've broken a few on my Logitech keyboard and finding replacement sets for that particular switch type is difficult so for example for that space bar section you can remap enter or backspace so it's easier to reach with your hands on the mouse one of the keys can be delete as that's normally not found as a separate key on 60% designs or whatever else you feel is appropriate to go there as the entire layout is completely customizable with an easy UI configurator you can create layers for different uses and perky lighting designs for example layer one can hold all the F keys and the gaming layout and we have a total of ten layers to switch between in the current build of the software you cannot record macros which I don't really do but that is definitely a value out in the future that they will add but I do appreciate the simplicity of that whole configurator and lastly here's a type test and keep in mind that I'm still a bit more accurate and faster when the keyboard is put back together but when the keyboard is in split mode this is definitely more comfortable I'm just training my fingers on the right hand because otherwise it's a bit unnatural for me and to conclude the race keyboard is a fine package that reaches into the ergonomic space and so the gaming space and to the enthusiast market too with the hot swappable switches and a standard layout it is a very expensive keyboard but I feel like the price does reflect the quality of the product and I'm excited to see digna as a brand grow because their attention to detail is fantastic and they seem to be quite committed to their community and their customer base I'm Dimitri thanks much for watching check out this other relevant content

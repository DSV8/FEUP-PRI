    "transcript": "- PlayStation. Sony has brought to us their brand new gaming headphones, the Sony INZONE H3 and the Sony INZONE H9. I believe there's also an H7 that's in the middle tier. This is the cheap boys. This is the expensive boys. Not only are they for PlayStation 5 and you can kind of tell, 'cause they're doing the whole black and white aesthetic, they're also for PC. You know what? We'll start on the cheap end. There's a bonus box here. Oh, they left us a note. Okay. Okay. (gasp) A shirt! It's kind of see through - [Bell] Even better. - I'm gonna put it on right now. - [Bell] Oh! - I've been exercising for this. - [Bell] Editor, put in romantic music. - Yeah. (romantic music) - [Bell] Oh my God. Editor blur that! Editor blur it! Oh no! - Now let's put on some real merch again. Lttstore.com, new ShortCircuit hoodies. Okay. Let's start with the INZONE H3s. Yeah. So these are $99, which is a pretty good price. That's the same price as Razer's Barracuda Xs, which are their lower tier which are probably the better ones to get if you're gonna get Razer headphones because I would not spend lots of money on Razer headphones. Hi-ya! Okay. A USB-A to, like, 3.5 millimeter adapter. That's chonky. (chuckles) Here's the cable for the headphones. It's just a textured plastic. In here we got (gasp) stickers. Everyone's favorite. They did say on the back of the box that this is a renewable packaging initiative, and like yeah, everything's paper. Sweet, so here's the headphones. These are all-plastic construction. I can tell, except for... Whoa, this is weird. I've never actually felt, there's like that sheen to it. Let's look around. So you can adjust the headphones. It's several points of adjustment, but there's tons of options so you're not gonna have any issues. It's a pretty big headband, but they kind of dupe ya. It looks like it has a head cushion that goes all the way around, but this is squishy and (headband thunks) this is hard plastic. See? So I can squish, squish. And then.... (headband thunks) So that might be really uncomfortable in the seams, we'll have to try them on. A boom arm microphone. Is that has a click? So maybe it has an auto-mute function. Volume up and down. Wow, they have no wireless connectivity. That's kind of disappointing. I get that they're $99, but I feel like you can get a lot of $99 headsets with wireless like the Barracuda Xs from Razer. I think that there's lots at the price point. And even if there isn't, then this, it's still kind of a big missing feature, especially if these are like kind of targeted for your PlayStation 5, because my PlayStation 5 might be a bit further than this away. As long as you have nobody who needs to ever cross in front of the TV, you're good. They say don't plug it into a laptop. It's after embargo. Can't tell me what to do Sony. Plug it into my laptop. Let's put 'em on. Not really great sound isolation, but that's okay, it's like... Okay, let's get some audio going. Let's play some music. Comfort wise, it's fine. This is not an issue on my head, this little lip here. You can see that they stick out pretty far because there is a decent amount of depth. These don't fit super nicely on my head. The cushions a little bit hard for how light these are. They don't really stick on. Like, there's very little clamping force, for better or for worse. Luckily, you're not moving too much when you game. I don't know if you're like me. You just kinda go. (laid-back jazz music) From a music perspective, it's definitely V-shaped still. It's a little bright on the highs for my liking. These are sounding quite good. The stereo imaging, just without any spatial audio, it's decent, especially for closed backs. The audio quality is pretty good for at the $100 price point. You could do a lot worse than this I think. Sinful Caesar sipped his snifter, seized his knees and sneezed. Round and round the rugged rock the ragged rascal ran. She sells sea shells by the sea shore. Does the mic sound good? I hope it sounds good. We have a full eight level equalizer in here. Spatial Sound is available for these. It has dynamic range control to adjust between the maximum and the minimum volumes which can be great if you're in like a noisier area, you can bump up the quiet. Auto gain control, microphone volume. In the equalizer we have some pre-made sound profiles. We've got Flat, Bass Boost. Wow, they crank it up 12 dB, oh my God. (chuckles) Music/Video. Music/Video lowers the high end and bumps up the bass. So I guess they may have tuned this specifically to produce better speech, have a little bit of extra detail, which is something I noted when I was listening, is that there's a little bit of extra detail on the highs. With these headphones, they have a sound personalization app, where basically, you take a picture of your ear and it'll scan your ear and it'll tune the headphones to fit your ear. I don't think those are very reliable. It's kind of an interesting feature that I've seen on a few sets of headphones. I know that, I think Soundcore has done it. I've never been super happy with the tunings that I've received from that. Oh, \"What Was The Greatest Year for Tech?\" just came out on Floatplane. I have a fun answer. You should go check it out over there. - [Bell] Me too. What was your answer? - [Bell] You gotta watch and find out. - Dang, you got me Bell. (Bell chuckles) I'm subscribing to Floatplane. Analyze your ear shape. Pictures taken of your ear- (voice warbling quickly) After 30 days. I trust 'em. - [Computer Voice] Ears. Next, turn your face forward. Turn your head slowly to the right Capture photo. - No, it said turn my head to the right. I turned it to the left like a fool. - [Computer Voice] Next, turn your head slowly to the left. - It's very demanding. - [Computer Voice] Captured photo. - It did not capture the, look at what it did. Look at what it did. The first one's correct. And then the second one, I'm like not even turned. It's a good thing my right ears gross. Okay. So now I have to log into it on here. Spatial Sound personalization failed. Apply. Here we go, boys. Now this is my own personal sound. No one else can have it. Okay. Spacial audio. If it's on, it doesn't sound that much better than just having stereo. Funny how that is. I don't, I don't... Okay, if I turn it off. Um, you know? It makes a difference, I just don't see how it makes a big difference. I'm gonna try again. It sounds worse. Every single time I've tried any app that does, like, ear personalization. It makes the audio sound like crap. For me, it constantly bumps up the treble to really annoying amounts making it sound cheap and tinny and it feels like I've lost the base in this. And I don't really feel like I have much of a better semblance of where things are. Now that I've switched it on and off a couple times I can't really tell a difference, so... Maybe I got dumb for ears, but for $100 you could do worse. Before we get to Sony's fancy pants headphones. We're gonna do something fancy in our pants with today's sponsor, MANSCAPED.

(Adam grunting musically) Ooh, it's a much smaller sticker. It's easier to get into. INZONE H9. It's got acoustic structure to achieve rich spatial expression, a boom microphone with high quality sound and blah, blah, blah, noise canceling function. Oh, with Dual Noise Sensor technology, it's wireless, unlike the previous one. 2.4 gigahertz of signal, (laughs) noise canceling, Bluetooth and Discord certified. I didn't know that that's a thing. 32 hours of battery life with noise canceling off. Apparently it's only 20 hours with noise canceling on. So that's doing some heavy duty processing in the headphones, that's a big gap. But let's get inside. Let's look. Oh, oh, oh, it's a little bit fancier presentation too. We got a Type-C to USB-A cable. We have booklets, stickers, stickers, stickers, stickers! Hey Razer, this is a good way to make a dongle. It doesn't block any ports. Who would've thought of that? Oh, you can go PC or PS5. Easily connectable. There's a button here, that's probably for pairing. Also an LED to indicate the status of your headphones, whether or not it's connected. But let's get to... Ew. (chuckles) They kind of put like ears in it. Okay, wow. These feels so much more durable. They're still an all-plastic construction, but they're just, they have a little bit more heft to them. The plastic feels a lot nicer. Even, even the clicks, the adjustment clicks is sturdier. Is it me or do the ear cups look bigger? Yeah, it's amazing the subtle differences, like the different pivoting actions. Instead of doing this wider hinge they use this like more integrated into the ear cup kind of hinge. You can see that action there. And then also the twist there. So it's like actually a nicer pleather on the top. There's more texture to it. This is kind of very plasticky feeling. This feels much more like a fake leather. Power button, Bluetooth, game and chat, Uh, noise canceling or ambient mode. USB-C port, volume knob. Even the volume knob, it's weird, the good ones have actual stepping. This is just a smooth roll. It's funny. You think that they would want to share more parts to save some money but no, these feel, like, significantly better. Also non-removable ear cups it looks like, which is a shame because ear cups are one of the first things to go on headphones. Like headphones can be good for a long, long time. Okay. Let's get 'em on. Let's do this. Oh yeah. These feel better. It... Oh no, that's ambience? Wait, no. This is ambience. Whatever was just dropped. I could hear very, very well. It did not cancel that noise very well. It's weird 'cause I can hear myself. Why can I hear myself? - [Bell] Hello? - Hello? I can't, yeah, no, that's... I'm like always, oh, that's actually great! It always gives you an automatic feedback through the microphone, which is awesome because then you can tell how loud you're talking which is great because having any sort of delay in hearing back your voice will make you get very confused, very quickly. Noise canceling is on. Noise canceling, I don't think it's very good. Do we...? If we can play some noises. (siren blares) (car honking) So apparently they have noise canceling inherited from the Sony WH-1000 headphone line. Which is so vague as to be meaningless because the, like, their AnC has gotten really good but if it's not the AnC on the XM4s or XM5s, that's pretty middling right now. And that's how I feel it is. It doesn't feel like it's doing that great of a job which is really disappointing, but maybe the audio quality is gonna be there. We're in. It recognized me. Same deal as before. We have some device settings here. Okay, cool. So there's noise canceling. Priority sound quality or priority stable connection with Bluetooth. That's interesting. So the nice thing about having the multipoint is that you can be connected to your phone via Bluetooth and you can be connected to your computer with the dongle. (upbeat electronic music) - [Bell] Adam. He's in gamer mode. No, no. That... No. Pay attention. Don't. No, no, no, not crab. Not crab, look at me! Look at him. Oh, he's dancing. - [Robert] He's gone. - These definitely sound more alive. I don't know. Let's test out another song. (laid-back jazz music) Yeah. These sound much better. Quite good, actually. Whereas those felt tinny and a little harsh in the highs, these feel much more detailed but still reserved without being fatiguing. Like, it doesn't sound like it's constantly attacking with, like, really high-pitched noises. They're just more full feeling overall. Okay, so the sound, I don't know, it's fine. It sounds really, it sounds good. It sounds better than the previous headphones. You get about 30 seconds of it actually functioning before it stops. It changes the noise canceling profiles just fine. But the EQ doesn't work. So I don't really know what's going on. It seems like the app on the PC isn't really working with me. It isn't changing settings. It like changes one setting and then nothing else sticks. We're just gonna ditch this. Sorry, Sony and fans. I would like to spend more time with it but we're gonna move on. Okay. So we were hooked up to the PS5. We are gonna be playing some \"Returnal\" today. I've never played it before. And we got the 3D audio going on my headphones. Let's play some some fricking \"Returnal.\" Like, the spatial audio is quite good. Like, I can hear things around me. I hear things when they're behind me and below me. I'm gonna turn off the spatial audio just to get a quick comparison. Oh, woulda dodged that if I had spatial audio. There's not that much more positional information that I really gained from the 3D audio and I still yet to feel like it really is, and maybe it's tough cause it's like, kind of a high movement, higher action thing. Maybe if I was doing something like \"The Last Of Us,\" where it's like slow and methodical and you're trying to listen for things that are around you. The sound quality? Good. It sounds great. It is very detailed. I can hear stuff. Position, like, for an open-backed headphone, the soundstage feels pretty wide. I'm impressed. Though, we should remember that these are $300, which is a lot. Getting it up and running with the PlayStation was literally as easy as plugging in the dongle, which is great. I'm not sure if you can do it with Bluetooth but if you have the dongle, why would you use Bluetooth? The latency is excellent. The moment I see a sound effect, I hear it. It's great. In terms of their implementation with Sony's products, as well as their overall quality in terms of build and sound, they're not a bad buy. Sony, you did okay. You could have done better. You did fine. Okay, these, I think for $100 you could do better, but they're not a terrible buy. I wouldn't get them for a PC. Also the cable for PlayStation doesn't really make sense so I don't really get what the H3s are for, so... Let's talk about the H9s. $300, you get a lot of features packed into these, but it's hard to recommend over substantially cheaper headphones that are gaming-focused like the SteelSeries Arctis 7s or the HyperX Clouds. For $300 do these really justify for the price? It's tough to say. The build quality's nice. They were very comfortable. The sound quality was quite good. I enjoyed those. Are they better than the Barracuda Pros? Which would probably be a near competitor. (chuckling) Absolutely, they're better! They actually sound good and they were convenient to work with. Even if their software didn't function that well I could actually get into it without having to sign up for anything. This is a good first step for Sony. I think there's a lot of lessons they can learn from these I think as a PlayStation accessory, these are quite good, both of them. They're both decent options. The wire's too short though. Sony, what are you thinking? If you liked this video, keep an eye out for our upcoming video about Sony's new INZONE monitor. That looks pretty good. I wish I was unboxing it, but sadly that is going to Nicholas Plouffe. Well, that's not sad. It's sad for me. Otherwise, if you wanna check out something you can watch right now, why don't you check out my unboxing of the Razer Barracuda Pros. They're probably a competitor because they're only 50 bucks cheaper, baa. Yeah, Sony INZONE.",

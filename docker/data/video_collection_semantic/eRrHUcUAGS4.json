    "transcript": "- Hey everyone, it's Justine. And today, we're checking out a brand new type of drone. This is the HoverAir X1, and I'm so excited to show this to you. As you may know, I'm a huge fan of flying drones, but what makes this so much different, there's no controller and this will fly by itself. It'll take off from your palm, it'll fly pre-programed routes, and you really don't have to do much of anything at all. It does all the work for you. A huge thank you to HoverAir for partnering with me on this video. I can't wait to show you more. Now, first things first, we've gotta unbox. So we have two colors. I've got the white one and the black one here. Oh, look at these. We have more boxes to unbox inside of the box. Battery charging hub and the battery. Here it is. Look how cool it looks. It's so small. Like this is so tiny. Like look at this, I can actually put this in my pocket. I mean, it's smaller than my phone almost. Here's the black one. They both look so good. Have a little carrying case and a cable. I like that they color coordinated the USB-C cables. Look at this tiny carrying bag. It's so cute. What you got in that bag? A drone? We've got our battery. (upbeat music) So I've been outside testing out the new HoverAir X1 here in Hawaii, and this has by far exceeded my expectations. Now, when I first heard about this, I was like, okay, cool. It's a palm-sized self-flying camera. Is that actually gonna be any good? Yes, it is, and it is so impressive. The coolest thing about it is you don't have to really think when you're using it. And the biggest learning curve for me as a drone pilot who's been flying drones for a really long time is learning to trust the process. Normally I'm the one in control. You have to always be on the sticks, ready to control the drone. There's so many little things that I love about it. I mean, look at this. It just folds right out, just like that. And within seconds, you're ready to get a really awesome shot. I've been at an event here in Hawaii and I've just been carrying this around in my yoga pants pocket, and it's honestly smaller than my phone and it's so easy to use. You just press the button to turn it on and then it's cool because it will connect to an app, but it does have these buttons that are right on the top that will allow you to choose the different types of flight modes that you wanna fly. In case you forget what one of them does, it'll tell you. - [Drone Machine] Zoom out. Follow. Orbit. Bird eye. Custom. - And if you wanna adjust the distance on any of these, you just do a long press in that specific setting and it'll let you. - [Drone Machine] Zoom out 20 feet. Zoom out 30 feet. - All of these settings can also be customized inside of the app, but it's great if you don't have your phone or you just wanna get a quick shot, you can do everything right here. (upbeat music) (upbeat music continues) Look at it going. Dude! You're cool. That was awesome. Now, a lot of drones record audio, but the only thing that you end up hearing from those devices is the sound of propellers and the motors. With this, you can actually connect it to your phone so that it'll be able to record the audio of you talking or whatever it is that's happening while the drone is flying. Right now I'm actually recording with a microphone on my phone so you'll be able to get the sound of me talking. One thing that I'm so impressed with is the tracking on this. I went for a run at the beach and it was chasing me and it was so incredible. I was running as fast as I could, maybe not that fast, but it was pretty quick. Time to land. I'm obsessed. I love this so much. (drone buzzing) - [Recorder] There she goes. (ocean waves crashing) Look at her go. Oh gosh, it's going to get me! It's getting me! (upbeat music) So, normally when I think about drones, I think about flying them over cliffs or oceans and getting these incredible aerial views. But with this, this is something that I feel is capturing moments, being able to take photos and videos really quickly of friends, and you don't really have to even think about it. I also love that this will shoot vertical videos. So if you are a vertical video content creator or you'd like to share things to stories, this is perfect for that. The design of this is really cool and it's so small and it only weighs 125 grams. The enclosed propellers make it super safe to fly around other people, and when you're ready to start shooting, if you just hold it in the palm of your hand, press the button, wait three seconds, and there it goes. And when you're ready to stop recording, you just put your palm out and it'll automatically land. Another thing that's really cool about the X1 is it doesn't rely on GPS. It uses something called VIO technology. This allows it to orient itself to a surrounding area and it doesn't have to rely on GPS, especially if GPS signals are weak. This way it can easily transition between locations and you won't have to worry about losing a GPS signal. I was also pretty impressed with how stabilized this was in some windier conditions. Now obviously you don't wanna be flying this if it's super windy, but there were some times that I was flying it where there was some wind and it held up really well. For this being as small as it is, I was really impressed with the video quality. It does shoot 2.7K at 30 frames a second, and you can shoot 1080 at 60 to get some slow-mo shots. I also love inside the app you can get a preview of what you've shot, so you can quickly download it, save it and share it with friends or on social media. I also like that there's two versions that you can choose from. If you want the white or the black, you have that option as well. The battery just pops off just like so, and the battery life is actually pretty impressive and I do like that this comes with two batteries. So if your battery happens to get low, you can pop a new one on and start recording. I had so much fun testing these out. I'll put a link in the description if you guys wanna get more information or to purchase. I'm so excited to be adding this to my travel kit and basically just my everyday bag 'cause I feel like I can put this in my pocket, put it in my purse, and at any point, I can just pull this out and get a really cool shot. And with that, my friends, let's get a shot to end this video. (upbeat music)",

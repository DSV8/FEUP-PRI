    "transcript": "- This episode of Krazy Ken's Tech Misadventures is sponsored by Linode. - Okay, let's holly (beep ) what the (beep) is going on here? We're gonna be here for a while-- - (upbeat music) - Hey guys, how're you all doing really that's just great you know I'm doing pretty great today too because I'm here in the lair and yes 10 stories above us there is a pandemic going on and a lot of other things I don't want to talk about. The world's a scary place but I have friends with me today, Maniac Mike and Brainiac Brent are here. - Hey - Hey yeah. They're gonna help me with a quick little project today and we're gonna be upgrading the SSD inside this MacBook Pro. This is a late 2013 MacBook Pro 15 inch with Retina display and it's been my daily driver for six and a half years but it only has a 512 GB SSD in it which is pretty good but after six and a half years and constantly fighting with keeping the space free it's becoming a little bit of a problem now so we're gonna put a new SSD in it. Brainiac Brent would you do the honors? Thank you for handing me that. So we went to OWC and got an Aura SSD, this is a one terabyte SSD that we're gonna throw in here and it should be pretty straightforward then we're gonna use Time Machine, which is the Mac's built-in backup feature to restore the system that's on the SSD in here currently to this new SSD. Now if you're new to the Computer Clan channel, first of all welcome. Second of all, Krazy Ken's Tech Misadventures is definitely not a dedicated how-to series. We experiment, we tinker and sometimes things go wrong. Again we like to document that stuff for fun. But you can absolutely learn stuff from us too. So let's unbox this boy. So apparently this came with $100 wine voucher. But yeah, so if Maniac Mike or Brainiac Brent if you actually want to take this and give it to a loved one you can have $100 wine voucher yes, every computer geek like me loves to upgrade SSDs and then, oh right in the face. And go out and get some wine. So, - [Brent] It is good for celebration you know. - Yeah - [Brent] Once you have done the job successfully-- - You know that's probably what it is, yeah, yeah exactly. So here we go, I was about to say it's a little bit smaller than I thought it was and now everybody can make dirty jokes. So that actually is a little bit smaller than I was thinking but it makes sense because we're working in a laptop here and I think that's it. Hang on there's a piece of paper in here. Important notice, macOS 10.13 High Sierra or later must be installed on the host computer before installing the Aura Pro X2. These OS versions include an EFI firmware update on your Mac without the update the host computer will not recognize the SSD. Good to know. We are running Mac OS Mojave so we'll be fine. Okay, that's holly (beep). That came out a little bit quicker than I wanted it to don't touch the contacts like I said I'm not really professional but it's okay we have fun. So this is the terabyte SSD. So now I'm gonna set that off to the side and it's always good to have one of these on standby. This is the awesome iFixit I think the tech tool Pro kit whatever it's called. I don't know if any of you guys know. Greg Hrutkay from Hrutkay Mods generously donated this to me so we will use this to open up the computer. So MacBook Pros, well pretty much all Apple products use that pentabular screw, so we need to get a pentabular bit. Pentalobe? - [Brent] Can I see it? - Yeah, it's kind of like a flower it's got five little - [Brent] I call that torque. - But this is called pentalobe. - [Brent] Oh, no it is a little pea. - Yeah, it's a pentalobe, so you need a little bit of a special screw driver but that's okay these iFixit kits are awesome so something fell over there, let's go ahead and what I like to do is just set up a little towel because I wanna treat my computer with the utmost care and I don't want to scratch it off even though it's made of a durable aluminum frame as I say while looking at the two scratches on the bottom. - [Mike] It's already scratched up anyways. - Well on the bottom I mean the top is pretty clean though. Six and a half year old computer guys this thing looks pretty dang spotless - [Brent] The lid is very nice. - Oh, thank you so much I made it myself. - [Brent] By hand, how did you do the Apple logo - I can't talk about that (laughs) trade secrets. All right so let's go and take this apart now. So more specifically I'm actually using a P5 bit so it's a pretty tiny like five-spoked bit to get into these Apple products here. So let's just go ahead and unscrew these and also just as a general note one SSD does not work with everything I mean even the MacBook Pros even though there's some similarities and the models may be similar there are some big differences where certain Mac's will not work with certain SSDs typically a website will tell you the compatibility. All right so we have all the screws out and sometimes this guy's a little stubborn, pop it up, there we go, we got it. - [Brent] Can I have-- - Oh yeah, you can do that, so here's the SSD and I should actually maybe have mentioned this earlier but again this isn't a dedicated tutorial but before you rip the current SSD which is down there out of your system make sure you have your data backed up for a restore and also make sure the backup actually works because the restoration needs to be bootable. Now there's different ways you can migrate your data over to a new SSD but in my case again I'm using Time Machine and that's built into Mac OS recovery mode. All right so let's pop out the old SSD and pop in the new one. Okay ,so while we're in here, we're just gonna dust it off a little bit 'cause it's a little dusty, I don't have any compressed air so I'm just gonna use a cotton T-shirt to wipe it down. (upbeat music) All right so here's the 512 GB SSD Samsung SSD that is currently in the system we are now switching to a Torx bit. Holly (beep) (laughs) - [Mike] That's interesting. - [Ken] That's a speaker, so there's a magnet there - [Mike] Oh yeah. - [Ken] That was a T3 let's try T4. There we go. And there we go, there's our older SSD some dust under there let's grab my professional T-shirt. - [Brent] 100% cotton that's professional. (laughing) - [Ken] So now we'll put the Aura in there. (Beep) (laughing) I do have butterfingers, I really do. So this was a little stubborn I didn't wanna break anything but I just had it like jiggle it back and forth a little bit and keep pushing forward and then it settled in there. Now we'll take our torque screw and screw that back in and there we go. Okay, let's get the bottom case back on and then start screwing in all the pentabular screws. Oh wait I'm still using the torque bit no wonder they're not fitting on the head. I've got a switch and before I reassemble I just wanna remind you that these two screw holes are 2.3 millimeter screws and the rest are three, so make sure to keep those separate. All right let's put that in and that's the last screw all ten are in. So let's flip it over, boot it up, well not boot it up, turn it on, it should give us the blinking question mark but everything else should be operational. (laptop doinking) That's a good sign and we should get a blinking question mark. taking a little while. Anyway while that's loading I just wanna show, oh there we go, we got the question mark, that's perfect. So what we're gonna do, is we're gonna boot off the backup on here because recovery mode has some special feature that works with Time Machine drives and this is a Time Machine drive. So let's go ahead and plug in the Seagate here and reboot the computer. Okay, so I held down option for the boot picker. You know what? Let's just go to internet recovery. - [Mike] You don't have to reboot. You can just select to network - There we go. - There we go. - [Mike] Don't listen to me! - [Ken] No that's okay. So recovery mode is a cool built-in feature but typically it's installed on your SSD alongside your operating system. We just put a fresh new SSD in here and there's no recovery mode on it but thankfully we can just pull a recovery system from the cloud. - [Brent] I'm usually used to Time Machine making a recovery partition on your drive. - [Ken] I thought it did that but I also do have this dual partition anyway 'cause it's also the backup for my raid. - [Brent] They might not have done it. - [Ken] Yeah I might have just messed with it and it was like, can't figure it out but it's fine we have Internet recovery that's really all we need so then we'll format the SSD and then go into Time Machine restore mode and everything will just magically transfer back over and basically we'll pick up where we left off but now with double the space. So Maniac Mike just reminded me that yeah because I don't have the network selected internet recovery actually may not know what network to pull from - [Mike] That's exactly what I'm trying to say. - [Ken] Yeah, I didn't, I'm sorry-- - [Mike] You don't need to do that, wait we actually do. - [Ken] Sorry I thought this system was smart enough to go oh you're need to connect to a network first but yeah Brent reminded me when I do live broadcasts I just have this Ethernet with some conversion technology on the end so maybe it'll just work when we plug it in. Maybe we have to reboot. Oh (beep) What the (beep) - [Mike] Wow! - [Brent] Didn't do that before. - [Ken] It was like right before I plugged it so it must have known what WiFi to pull from - [Brent] I guess so. - [Ken] Okay I was originally concerned that I may not be able to... Oh (beep) this is Mavericks. (laughs) This should still work though I think it should give us all we need. - [Brent] Time Machine backup it might pull your system. - [Ken] Let's go ahead and make sure this drive is formatted. Oh wait, what? - [Brent] It's Mavericks, it doesn't understand. - [Ken] Holly (beep) that's right Let's see, that's what I was expecting to see it gives you a little time remaining. Now it should get a newer operating system on here. All right Brainiac Brent toss me the flash drive Okay so what we're gonna do is we need to get a bootable macOS on this flash drive that's new enough to be able to read the SSD so we can format it and then run the time-machine restoration process. So we busted out a MacBook Pro to be able to download an image and get this drive bootable and as a backup just in case this doesn't work we have the Mac Mini sitting over there which we can use to get an image on here so then basically we just plug the flash drive into the MacBook Pro back here and then we boot off of it. Now should we have had something bootable earlier just in case sure that would have been nice but I didn't really think about that. I didn't think that'd be necessary. The reason why we can't boot up the MacBook pro right now to get something newer is well the the internet recovery runs too old of an operating system and the newer recovery mode is on the SSD we took out of the computer. So we're a little bit SOL there, so now it's time just to download an image and pray Colin dosdude is gonna save our butts again. I really should get more flash drives with macOS installers on there because I have images but they're all residing on an encrypted APFS volume right now. When you encrypt the drive through the finder it converts HFS to APFS so I can't mount any of that stuff on here and just take the image and put it on the flash drive of course. The Apple and backwards compatibility isn't the greatest thing but we're also talking Snow Leopard. So we're gonna boot into Windows 7 which I just happen to have on this computer which has newer browsers. We're gonna get an image, loaded into the Mac partition run the terminal command to restore it bootable to the flash drive and everyone will be frickin happy. Now you may be wondering Krazy Ken why don't you just put this in an external like NVME thing and just plug it in and image the data over. I could have, I just don't have an external like thingamajig to do that. I have a SATA one, but I don't have one that fits this SSD unfortunately But I thought Time Machine would be nice and easy but nope. Totally forgot I have no way to actually access the Time Machine data right now. That was an oversight. Congratulations! Welcome to the Krazy Ken's Tech Misadventure Show. Enjoy your (beep) stay. Yeah we got to do a mirror 'cause the other one did not work. All right so we're downloading the patcher just to get easier access to the actual installer from Apple, we're not actually using the patcher for anything we don't need to. - [Mike] Good news is the patcher will or at least should run in Snow Leopard so we can at least download the Installer. - [Ken] Oh I didn't even think about that is it actually gonna work in Snow Leopard? Snow Leopard's pretty old, you think it's gonna work? - [Brent] Maybe, we're gonna find out. - [Ken] We're gonna find out. This is so much fun. - [Mike] No that doesn't. - Awh - Awh - Oh dosdude. dosdude I love you so much, you're amazing, - [Mike] Command D. - [Ken] Yep command D and download macOS save it to the desktop boom Das dude is (beep) awesome. He's saving our bacon. - [Brent] It downloads directly from Apple. - [Ken] He's saving our ass. Mountain Lion is still going along okay we're putting that on the Mac Mini just as a backup solution. Of course there's an error. Why wouldn't there be an error? It is too easy if there's no error so we'll eject that, throw that in the trash and throw this in the trash and we'll try again on the Mac Mini. But before we continue let's take a quick second to talk about Linode. No matter what skill level you're at or what technology stack you use. Linode makes it easy to give your creations their own personal space on the Internet. If you just need something small, like a simple website, game server or personal VPN, Linode has you covered. If you need to manage tons of websites and reliably serve them to millions of visitors, well guess what, Linode can do that too. Unlike entry-level hosting services that lock you into their platform, Linode gives you full backend access to customize and control your server to fit your needs.

On a new Linode account, you can sign up with the link in the description. All right now back to the Mac. What the shit is going on here we're gonna be here for a while. Oh did we just (beep) time-travel? what happened? Okay, so now the download of Mountain Lion is done and it's performing the installation phase and hope fully we'll be able to use this newer operating system on a newer Mac. And actually make some progress with downloading the image we need and being able to restore that to the flash drive 'cause that other MacBook was just not cooperating well. We'll see. All right we got the bong so the installation just finished we are now rebooting it into Mountain Lion. While that's loading, I'm gonna go ahead and get the Ethernet plugged in. Just to be sure, just in case the WiFi is causing any issues. Okay we are done with the setup assistant and look at that Mountain Lion desktop right there. Okay, let's make sure we're on the Ethernet. Ethernet is connected. Alright let's go to dosdude's website, natively support a machine, we got that download, yes to the desktop boom! Do note how much faster this is going on here we're already almost at like 3/4 of a gig - [Mike] It's much faster. - [Ken] And before, yeah, it's a lot faster and hopefully we don't get a error like we did last time. All right Brent's gonna install, not install but insert the flash drive into the computer. We're almost done downloading the DMG, so then we just need to run a little command that yes we do need to initialize this. What's even on here? What you put a Linux distro on here. yeah so let's format this as macOS extended journaled. I'll just call it untitled 1 because we are original. Okay so while that's doing its thing I'm gonna move this Installer into the Applications folder just because the terminal command is, the syntax is already set up to look in that directory. - [Brent] Again? - [Ken] Yes. - [Brent] You wanna make things a lot more easier rename untitled one. - [Ken] Oh yeah, - [Brent] To whatever the access, I think it's in \"My volume\" - [Ken] I guess we could just do that so we don't have to change it. Let's just call it \"My volume\" and I'll make this big so everybody can see all the fun times we're having. So, what it's doing is, it's running a command inside the application, the Installer application called \"Crate Install Media\" and it's gonna put that on the volume, my volume, which is the flash drive we just inserted. So, let's go ahead and run that and let's see we need to erase, so we're gonna say Y for yes and it's gonna do its thing and then it's gonna basically make a flash drive installer. Okay, the operation is done, so now we can close out of here and eject the flash drive. So if everything worked according to plan what we should be able to do is plug the flash drive into the MacBook Pro, boot off of that, connect the Time Machine drive, unlock it and format the SSD and then restore. What could possibly go wrong? Well let's find out. - [Mike] Everything. - [Ken] Thank you Mike, you're making me saaaaaad, but you're also getting my expectations set so thank you. So we'll hold down the option key and hopefully it shows up I see it blinking. So it's reading something. There we go, install macOS Mojave, dosdude saved our butts, after a little bit of hoop jumping but that was mostly our fault. Anyway Boop we're gonna load in the air we go, that's what we wanted, a white Apple on a black background so. - [Mike] And a loading bar. - [Ken] And a loading bar not the little cartwheels. So that means, we're going into a newer system that will be compatible with the SSD and with our Time Machine backup. Okay now we're in a newer recovery mode hopefully we can read the SSD, if we can't read SSD then it must be installed wrong. Nope there it is, OWC Aura Pro X2 and it looks like it's already formatted as Mac OS extended journaled which is awesome. - [Brent] They gave special icon. - [Ken] Oh (beep) dude that's cool (laughs) that's pretty sweet. It's gonna be APFS later anyway so we might as well just do that now. Let's close out of there, restore from Time Machine, choose Time Machine, then we just have to unlock it and it should give us a list of dates, so we say continue, I haven't done this in forever but it should. Yep there we go macOS 10.14.6 which is Mojave or Mojave I guess and it was backed up earlier today that's when I was checking it and it did work but I only checked it up to this point. Now we do that and we say destination macOS the system will be restored to this disk restore and it'll erase. I had FileVault turned on earlier, it must just realize I had that encryption feature and it's warning me it's gonna be off now but we can always turn it back on later. So now Time Machine is gonna restore from the external hard drive which is plugged in here onto the new SSD we just installed and that should be it. Of course without today yeah, knock on board without today's going I won't be surprised if something else weird happens but I've used like the migration assistant before and Time Machine restore before and it's like usually pretty solid so I think we're okay. Alright we're almost at two gigs we got about 500 more to go so sit down get comfortable. I'm just gonna pause our transmission for a bit since this Time Machine restore is gonna take about three hours Maniac Mike thought it would be fun to bust out as iMac G3 Dalmatian go ahead and check out that bonus video with the Computer Clan channel membership or on our Patreon. You'll also get many other goodies such as these sexy new wallpapers enjoy. Alright let's check back in. Okay, so this has been running for a couple hours we're at 498 gigs restored which seems like a little much 'cause I don't remember the backup even being that big in the first place but that's okay, we're getting somewhere. Okay, so we're back at the login screen, it looks like the restoration was good Let's login and sometimes when you do this stuff you gotta expect maybe like one or two settings that have to be reset like some nuances will occur sometimes an application may not transfer right and it's like hey you may need to reactivate and stuff like that but most the time that doesn't happen and if you use stuff from the Apple App Store it's usually pretty much automatic you may need to resign in with your Apple ID and I wanna run the Blackmagic Disk Speed Test just to see what the speed of the disk is. Now my last one was about 800, 900 megabytes per second. I believe so this should be I think about the same I don't remember ordering anything faster but it's kind of just a good thing to check. Start the test, holy (beep) This is a little bit faster than my last SSD Oh my gosh! Wow, 1346 megabytes per second read time and again this is a six and a half year old laptop. - [Brent] It really impressed me seeing that there was a barely a dip I'm guessing sequential versus random read. - [Ken] Yeah, I'm not really sure how it calculates this stuff but it's mainly for testing like video performance. So if I zoom in here you'll see hey at ProRes 422 HQ at these resolutions you're fine. The only one it gave me a problem with was at 10 bit YUV 422 at 60 frames a second 4K that was the only time the right speed wasn't sufficient but I think we're okay with that because I don't even shoot in 422 HQ. I am a pussy and shootin' LT, which is a lower bitrate but it looks mostly the same. Unless you're doing like crazy effects working like super super high-resolution stuff you don't really need to shooting like 444, 422 HQ or any of that. Okay so there were a few bumps in the road but the SSD is now in here we have faster speeds and a lot more storage. So if I could go back in time and change anything and I recommend this to just have an enclosure so you can just directly transfer the data to the SSD without having to jump through all these hoops but because we had to jump through hoops we needed to have macOS installers on standby. So another thing I recommend no matter what system you use Linux distros, Windows macOS just have a couple flash drives with operating systems on them so you can boot off of them in case of an emergency or in case you need to recover data or something it's always nice just to have quick access to external drives you can boot from. So hey all the lessons we learn from falling forward and making those mistakes failing fast right. So this was fun I hope you learned something too I know I did, catch the crazy and pass it on.

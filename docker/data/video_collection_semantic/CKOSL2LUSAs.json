    "transcript": "today I'm going to build an all AMD mini-ITX gaming system in Deep Cool's new little bebe case which is interesting because despite of its diminutive size it still supports air coolers the size of Hercules's left swimmer sphere but first today's video is sponsored by Micro Center and there is super knowledgeable stuff it says it right in the name and if you're a new customer soaking up that knowledge you can get $25 off your purchase of $100 or more but if you shot there before microcenters got their made desktop deals Madness I guess with these couple of fine examples link below and finally check out Micro Center news with the link down below for a wealth of well-written Tech related articles thank you Micro Center for sponsoring today's video [Music] now in terms of platform I really wanted to do am5 because I've never built an am5 ITX system before and the main reason for that is that for some reason ITX am5 motherboards are absurdly expensive even this B 650i gigabyte board which was the cheapest ITX am5 motherboard I could find locally available was still a lot like like a lot for what it is especially when compared to their Intel counterparts luckily we are starting to see a620 ITX boards on the market but this one was just available near me so yeah this this this is more a me problem than a General market problem I guess either way that motherboard does give us access to this very exciting ryen 57600 X which I'm using because I had [Music] one in all fairness it's not quite like one of those restaurants people use to bribe government official this is a lot of motherboard you can see that it's got more heat sink than PCB which makes cooler compatibility nice and terrible very good touch in terms of IO we get a bunch of very fast interconnects we even get 2.5 GB ethernet ooh now another interesting feature is this front panel card thing I am very interested to see how this is going to be implemented spoiler alert terribly and finally despite all that heat sink it still has a little whiny look looking fan [Music] oh ooh little connector that's always fun okay now it is super important to not remove those bits of plastic cuz you don't want your SSD making any thermal contact with the huge piece of heat sink and then just catch CCH fire underneath that very important that was sarcasm by the way ooh and they've got the little m.2 clippy I like those a lot you kind of pop it open and closed no need to screw it down very fancy now I just need to screw down the four screws that holds the heat sink in place doing 32 gigs of that D ddr5 there we go now I saw a bunch of deep cool pictures of that tiny little case with this assassin 5 in it which I really want to do cuz it's just wild seeing that cooler is stuffed in this tiny little case but I'm not convinced this thing is going to fit on that motherboard so let's find out let's do it now wait there's no way this Behemoth fits in that case there's also no way it fits on that mother and let's see so we're going to kind of oh I I think it may fit although I do think that it kind of hangs over the side so like the socket is too close to the the io so this clearance is going to be an issue but worst case scenario we just remove the fan right wanting to preserve both fans I decided to man the cooler on the other way around which may or may not be an issue later on [Music] oh my God I put the brackets on the wrong way around if only I looked at the the arrows on the clips is that it oh thank Lord It's finally [Music] on oh yeah that looks nice and absur I love it it's so [Music] ridiculous you can oh no way deep cool sent over the case with all of these bags of little pixel thingies which you can use to stick into the airflow bits on the case and make some art and you know what we're going to make with these but putting aside the pixel art which I'm 100% not going to view the little case is very cute there's a whole bunch of ventilation on the front and the top with our cool little handle I like that and then on the side we've got a tempered glass side panel so we can see the inside of the case with some exciting front iio and then there's even more ventilation on the back I'm super curious to see that case swallow all of this girth but I think it makes sense to drop the power supply in first then we use this cable to run the power out the back like that now I don't think I'm a huge fan of having this power cable dangler out the back but I guess you have to plug a power cable into a PC anyway so you're you're going to have summon like this either way I don't know let me know in the comments section down below what you think of this implementation oh um that fan doesn't fit in next to the power supply so I'm going to have to turn the cooler [Music] around okay so it's been 2 years this still doesn't look like it's going to work but let's give it a try it does it's almost like it was designed to fit in there and then while shifting cables around to get some Neer runs something terrible happened I definitely didn't rip the plastic housing around the front panel USB 3ender off the mbone that that's a thing that didn't happen and to fix it I had to remove the motherboard for the second time this build but luckily the pins were still there so I could slip the connector housing back over it without too much fuss oh my god oh that felt like driving a blade into a kitten's face that was wild but I think it's okay I don't know and in this this is the little front panel card thing that we spoke about earlier in the video with the front panel connectors and some SATA on here there's also like a fan header and stuff it's a bit of a weird implementation but I guess on ITX motherboards you run out of space all the time so you got to come up with stuff like this now considering that you also need this dongle thing it it's not a very neat implementation on oh my God this feels so destructive the little PCB doesn't resist much so when you kind of push this connector in place just feels like you're breaking it and then with just some mid tier struggles a motherboard was seated for hopefully the final time so now at this point I'm not entirely sure how the cable Management's going to work with the graphics card in here so let's drop the graphics card in and kind of try and figure something out I really hope the 7700 XT is going to fit in there o oh there we go oh wow this is a wild wildly full case look at look at how like barely the graphics card fits in there although it could have gone much much taller and it would have been fine but now we have the concern of of all of the cables because we do have a glass side panel so this does need to look presentable the cable management was one hell of a process but soon I was reassembling the case rearing to see if I'd broken anything in the process of assembling this bad boy and just like that our little AMD Beast is finished and by just like that I mean a lot of struggle uh there is some fingerprints we need to deal with but before we wipe it down and have a bit of an orle at it let's see if it works oh that's cool the Monitor and the case mats each other nice nothing nothing's happening oh no it's the front panel power plug in thing okay wait give me a second a few moments later I mean it just made a really weird noise a fan somewhere is being trapped by something oh yeah this fan is very unhappy oh oh ah ah oh now it is now it is okay okay I fixed it problem solved and with all the excitement of a PC well finished I was very much in the mood for some [Music] art oh crap it's not in the middle that took me ages either way I was very pleased with my slightly crooked master master piece so I installed some graphics C drivers so that we could game on our all AMD Mini ITX Beast now we're starting off with CS2 at 1080p low settings to get a sense of how we run Esports titles on the system and it's doing it very well we're getting well over 300 frames per second it's nice and smooth our temperatures are low it's interesting our GPU isn't being fully utilized but I mean it's things are going great here performance- wise oh yeah there we go so at 1080p High cyber Punk runs super well on this system I can't remember the last time I saw cyberpunk running like this to be honest usually the game's running at 8K and 1 frame per second on a potato but here we're getting over 120 frames per second and not only that it is a smooth 120 frames per second as it drops below 120 there but this is great this is going very well uh the CPU Cooler is a little bit noisy but we do have quite a bit of temperature Headroom GPU temperatures are very good in this case I mean 56 c that's very good for an ITX case that's very good for an ATX case I then spent ages absorbing the beautifully crafted cyberpunk world to see where the temperatures would top out and the temperatur stabilized pretty quickly uh we're seeing about 70 cius on the CPU which for this kind of ryzen CPU is pretty good and we've got some some great GPU temperatures going here despite about 200 watts of of power draw consistently for the whole time I've been running around so yeah it's just good oh even the last of us at 1080p High settings over 100 frames per second and it drops below 100 as I say that but here outside with the trees and the leaves and the and stuff it's looking very good and it it feels nice it ran the crap out of every game I threw at it spitting out impressive numbers at 1080p with higher presets in some of the games the 7600 X was being pushed pretty hard to keep up with that RX 7700 XT but generally I'm super happy with how the system turned out and I really like the implementation of this little b deep cool case which brings me to the end of the video for the next video I'm going to build a another all AMD am5 based system but with all of the components being the cheapest ones I could find on AliExpress so subscribe to the channel if you don't want to miss that video and until then thank you for watching bye-bye [Music]",

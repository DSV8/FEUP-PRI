    "transcript": "- So you have an extra $1,300 US kickin' around that you were going to allocate to a new Galaxy Note or some other overpriced phone, but instead, no, you're going back in time to the days when you used to just have an iPod or other Zune or some like portable music player device. And that's what this is, except it's not going back in time. This is the latest and greatest flagship from FiiO. This thing's ballin', and it's pretty kick-ass, honestly, it's sweet. $1,300 is a lot of money, FiiO has never made a device that costs that much money. They are actually moving up-market into areas of other expensive devices made by like Astell&Kern and other established players. So let's see if they can do it. This is a cool box. Look at that rainbow, that's pretty badass. Inside this box is another box. And inside that box, yet another box. (inhales) Very fragrant, it's wooden. I don't need this box. If there's a box inside here, I swear to God. Okay, it's a device, finally. (upbeat music) This thing is kind of a chonk. It's kind of a brick. Dual AK4499EQ. That's the DAC that's in here, made by AKM, they're really good at making DACs. They put two in here. The reason you would have two DACs, I guess less like switching noise because you're gonna have a one DAC per channel, for left ear and the right ear. This actually, each of these DACs has four channels on the, badass DACs. Ooh, that's a big screen! Mikey, I think he likes it! Before we turn that on, let's see if there's any more crap in here. There is. It looks like a SIM card removal tool, but again, this is not a phone. It costs as much as a phone, a nice phone, but no, this is for opening up your micro SD card slot. You can expand the storage of this thing from the internal 64 gigabytes, up to two terabytes. However, I'm noticing that even though there's like this tiny little stamp, like there's gonna be a second SD card slot there, but instead they've just written Dual AK4499, like they're just advertising the DACs again on it. Are they using this part from an another skew? Like their M11 or something? I don't know why they have that stamped out, just a tease. And the reason it's a tease is because it's really nice to have multiple expansion ports because otherwise they're making me buy like a terabyte or a two terabyte SD card, which is expensive. Like you're going to spend 300 bucks on that, but I guess they think you can afford it if you already bought a $1,300 music player, so screw you. So you got the tool for that. (upbeat music) Finally, I can get rid of this box. We have a charging cable, it's USB Type-C to Type-A, it seems like pretty quality, I guess. There's no wall wart, that's okay. You probably have a lot of these kickin' around by now. I should say that it has Quick Charge 2.0, so this thing will charge from depleted to full in about three and a half hours. And that should get you about 15 hours of battery life because the thing's battery is huge, it's probably why this thing is so big. This thing has a 7,490 milliamp hour battery. It's basically a battery bank with just some ports on top, that's insane. You've also got a little tiny baggie with a little adapter in it. This is from 3.5 millimeter to coax yellow, and hello, quick start guide. Lots of languages. What is this? This is a screen protector. It's like quite a bit more narrow than the screen itself. This screen is actually kinda nice, the way that it really kinda, it's slightly curved, and then it kinda disappears into the chamfer here, this is, chamfer, the edge, the bezel? The bevel, whatever. So I don't know if I would put this on, and if I did put it on, I don't know that it would protect the whole screen. Alright, let's turn this puppy on. All the buttons are on the side. I'm gonna hold down the power button. (singing high tones) Nothing on this side at all, on this side, you've got power. So I guess that's like the screen lock button, and you hold it down to reboot. Track backwards, track forward, play, pause. And then this one's not labeled at all. That is like a multifunction button that you can actually specify what it does. More on that in a bit. There's also a hold button, which is a toggle, which is pretty cool. It makes it so the buttons don't do anything, but it also, it doesn't make it so the screen stays totally off. When I hit the power button, the screen does still illuminate partially, but you can't do anything to it. Then you've got a knob. (laughs) This is an okay knob. It is a analog digital knob. It has a top and a bottom. You can't spin it freely, infinitely, and it has a blue LED on it that you can actually program. There's a couple of different settings for that. Why don't we look at those now? All right, but before we check out these cool settings, here's a message from our sponsor War Thunder, the free-to-play online military vehicle combat gate, it's available for Windows, Mac, Linux, PS4, Xbox One, all of that with cross-play. War Thunder features an incredible arsenal of more than 1.500 historically accurate playable tanks, aircraft, helicopters, and ships from the 1930s up to the 1990s, before some of you were born. Massive combined arms battles on over 80 major battlefields from World War II to the end of the Cold War. So head to the link below, and start playing now. And you'll also get an exclusive bonus. Alright, I gotta get into the settings to do that. I actually need to unlock it again. Thank you, yes, it's Android, so you can actually just go into the Play Store and download whatever apps you want. There's also some applications that are baked in here. I should say baked in, but they're not baked in, they're here so you can easily download them with one click. I don't know why they're not just on there by default. I guess they don't want you to take up more space than you have to. 64 gigabytes actually isn't that much. Anyway, it's Android, I go to the Android settings. Now the fact that it's Android settings actually kind of makes it harder to navigate than it would be if it was just a proprietary music-player-focused OS. So the settings are kind of all over the place. I wanna talk about the LED light thing. I believe that's actually in Display, which is a little weird. Indicator Light Control, sweet. So when it's charging, you can select it to be constantly on, pulsing or breathing, or just off. And when it's working like it is now, again, constantly on, pulsing, or off. We go into General, and we see that navigation control on the device and the software control, it's Android so you can set it to have the back button, or you can use the gesture control, which is what I do on my phone. So that's how I set it up now. So it's a swipe to go back, and swipe up to go to the home screen and everything like that. Now here's where it gets cool. The hold switch setting. So that hold button that we have here, by default, all it does is it deactivates all the buttons, and allows you to not be able to touch the screen, okay? But that's just by default, you can actually toggle all this crap on it. So basically, you can say which buttons you want to still work when the hold button is on. So you can have it so that only the next track button works. So you can still reach in your pocket and hit next, or whatever, you can turn them all on. I like this level of control, it's pretty sweet. The only thing that you can't adjust is the power button, because that kind of obviates what the whole switch is about, the whole switch is about making it so that your screen doesn't turn on. So I mean, they could have given us that option, but they didn't. Now, this is where it gets even sweeter. The multifunction button, which is that bottom one that has no identifiable marks, it can be programmed with this little list of special features. So you can make it say, add this song to my favorites, which is okay, play next randomly, this is so sweet. It's basically like a shuffle button, just play a random song. I don't like where I'm at, shuffle, but the song that it goes to next is determined by what kind of a folder you're in at that time. So if you happen to be in an album, like you're listening to just Brittany Spears' greatest hits, holy crap, her Instagram is insane, if you haven't seen it. You're listening to Brittany Spears, you hit shuffle. It's gonna go to a just different random track on that album. But if you were listening to all artists and you hit next, it'll just go to any random song from any artist. So the reason that this can be really cool is depending on how you have it set up at that moment, you can be listening to like a soundtrack, just Hans Zimmer \"Blade Runner 2049\" soundtrack. And then you're kinda like, you know what, I'm sick of this vibe. I hit my shuffle button, and boom, (snaps) suddenly now I'm listening to Tool, or Nine Inch Nails, or Radiohead, or other 2000s band that James likes. And you can just switch vibes easily, which is that's pretty badass. Okay, then there's some really weird stuff in here, like delete the currently playing song. And I checked this, there's no like, are you sure you wanna delete this? It just deletes it. I think this is really reckless, some people will never ever use this, but I actually kind of like it, because sometimes you really only care about like three songs on an album, or sometimes you're listening to like a hip-hop album, like Dr. Dre \"The Chronic 2001\", amazing album has a bunch of skits in it that I never wanna listen to. So I could just be sitting there in line for shawarma, and when like \"Pause for Porno\" comes on, I can just like, boom, it's gone off my device forever. And that can be very satisfying and a pretty quick way to like organically clean up your library without having to sit down and clean up your library. So that's cool. Then here's another interesting one. Enter Bluetooth receiving mode. So you can imagine a scenario where you're primarily using this, but suddenly you wanna get a song, or a track, or whatever off of your phone, and use your phone as a source while still using the DACs from this. So what you can do is enter Bluetooth receiving mode, and then this thing will just turn into a Bluetooth receiver. Your headphones will still be connected to here, and your phone will be sending the file via Bluetooth to here, and by the way it sends it really good with a really good Bluetooth chip set. And then you're still getting high quality audio to the headphones, so that's pretty cool. This isn't the only mode though. We were on Android Mode. There's also Pure Music Mode. Pure Music Mode brings this into kind of like iPod mode in a way, like iPod Classic, like you're in a music app now, that is all, all your antennas are off. I think you can turn the Bluetooth antenna back on, but by default it's off, your Wi-Fi is off, so there's just as little crosstalk and other signals coming to device as possible. The circuits are just empty. So that's pretty cool too. Oh, USB DAC mode. So you can hook this up to your computer, then, use that as a USB DAC instead of having to buy a separate desktop one. I never talked about the jacks yet. So you can see actually three ports, ha, your phone doesn't even have a headphone jack, we've got three here. You've got your regular 3.5 millimeter jack, which you could also call a single-ended line. Then you've got two balanced ports, one's 4.4 millimeter, the other's 2.5. A balanced cable is the same as XLR, if you've seen that plug that has like three prongs, and use it a plug in cameras and microphones and stuff like that. So what the heck is balanced, and why is it that when I did this Grado headphones review, we found out during that review that it was like $200 to have the cable terminate with XLR balanced output. When you have a cable like this, the whole audio signal is on this one line, so if you brought this cable close to a fluctuating magnetic field, like a DC power cable, for example, then that DC power cable could induce noise onto this cable. And then that noise would be audible if you have golden ears or whatever, to you listening to your music. However, if you use a balanced output in one of these ports, then that three-pronged cable, it actually has the audio signal on there twice. One prong is a ground, the other two prongs are audio signal, but it's not the exact same, they're out of phase, completely flipped. So the audio signal on one, when it hits a peak, the other signal is hitting a trough. And what this does is it makes it impervious to noise coming in because all you hear is the difference between those two waves. So if both those waves have the same noise on them, that noise is gonna get canceled out. This is called common-mode rejection. You can look that up. That's why it's so awesome to have balanced outputs, and why it's so expensive, and why I don't have an example here. So why don't I plug in these Grado headphones now, and actually listen to this thing? (upbeat music) Oh, this is clean. All right, the final thing I wanna tell you about with this that makes it so awesome to listen to is something they call active servo power. So basically on the final stage of the built-in amp in this thing, they have some intelligence to detect what kind of impedance your headphones you're plugging in has, and will step up the current accordingly. So if you're using like IEMs, earphones that go in your ear, you don't need that much power. So you don't want to ruin the headphones, and you don't wanna ruin your ears. So you can actually switch the mode here. Right now, I'm in over ear headphone mode. And so if you have really high impedance headphones that take a lot of power, this thing will see that and crank it up. And that's when it sounds way better having that on. There's also a low gain, and high gain modes. You can just leave it in low gain, it'll be less noisy, with this over your headphone mode on that ramps up like the high current mode, and it's wicked. Oh man, I don't even want to talk anymore. You guys just leave, just leave me with the headphones! So yeah, this thing is pretty sweet. I don't think it looks as cool as some of the other things in this price range. It does look pretty nice, but some of the other things in this price range were like really bad ass. And also it's hard to tell what button you're pressing. If this is in your pocket, you really can't tell. These buttons are all basically the same shape and size, except for this one's a little bigger, but that wouldn't really be detectable, I don't think, in my pocket. So it'd be nice if they were raised, or have different shapes. That's kind of a flaw. Other than that, pretty cool. I should actually just take this off, because it's kind of fingerprinty. Kind of glossy carbon fiber look. This thing is pretty versatile and pretty cool, and I think it's worth a close look if you're the type of person who wants to spend $1,300 on a portable media player.

    "description": "Lets Drop Test the New iPhone Xs. HUGE Thanks to LastPass for sponsoring this video! Click here to start using LastPass now:  Ever since Apple introduced the iPhone X and iPhone 8 with 'the most durable glass ever on a smartphone' ive been pretty skeptical. Especially after last years drop test when the phones broke after falling just a few feet. Has Apple changed anything with the new iPhone Xs? Is the glass somehow more durable? The only way to find out is with a drop test.  On my channel, I like to keep things pretty standard and realistic. These iPhone Xs drop tests will be performed from 'normal' heights, like knee, waist, and ear height. Which is where the majority of accidental falls will happen.

    "transcript": "Apple has claimed once again that they have the most durable glass ever on a smartphone. Today we're going to put that to the test. My theory is that glass is glass, and glass is still going to break. Huge thanks to LastPass for sponsoring this drop test and making this video possible. Switching phones is a hassle. Every new app needs it's own password, and you're probably like your grandparents, using the same simple password for everything. One app that makes remembering passwords super easy is LastPass. Used by millions of people, LastPass has the ability to generate long, super secure passwords that are encrypted. That means they are secure and you never need to remember what they are since they are saved inside the LastPass app. Since LastPass remembers your passwords for you, you never need to write them down or use the same password for everything. Whether you're on your computer or cellphone, the app itself is 100% free. But if you want a few extra perks, like a gigabyte of encrypted storage, it's only $2 a month. I'll leave a link down in the description below this video. Huge thanks once again to LastPass for making this drop test possible. Let's get started. [Intro] So today we're going to be drop testing 2 of Apple's brand new iPhone Xs's. Apple said they raised the bar with iPhone glass yet again, and we're going to find out how durable it is when dropped completely naked. One phone will be without a case, and the second phone will be covered in Amazon Prime's absolute cheapest case you can buy. It's $5. And we'll see how long each of the phones last with simple drop tests, with starting from the knee, then waist, then chest. And we'll see what happens when they drop from your ear down to the ground. I will be giving away the least broken of these 2 phones spoiler, probably the one in the case on my Instagram. I'll leave that link right here. Okay, so I'll be dropping the phones from right there out of the cab of my truck. And to record the phones dropping in slow motion, I have the iPhone Xs Max that I used for my durability test and teardown. And also recording in slow motion, we have the Pocophone F1, which I also did a durability test and teardown. So hopefully they can catch the drops and all of the slow motion glorious detail that we need. So protecting one of the phones is this case right here, which is the cheapest case on Amazon Prime. It's clear and has a soft rubber around the edges, and a little harder plastic on the back. It should do a pretty good job. Okay, the first drop test we'll be doing the iPhone Xs in a case. And we'll simulate as if you were sitting down and then standing up and forgetting that your phone was on your lap and it's sliding off your leg and hitting the ground. The phone is on my leg, right about knee height. Standing up. [Sad Music playing] And now let's do a the other iPhone that's unprotected. It's on my knee. I'm going to stand up. [Sad Music playing] Alright, looking all around the edge of the phone, there is no damage, surprisingly not even any scuffs along the gold side. It looks like right there along the tip of it we have one little scuff on the corner, which isn't too bad. And, of course, the iPhone inside of the case is probably just fine. No cracks along the back glass yet. Everything appears to be working just fine. Let's drop it from a little higher up. This time we'll be dropping it from waist high. We'll start with the unprotected phone and then finish off with the protected phone...Amazon's cheapest case. Pulling it out of my pocket and then dropping it. [Music playing] Alright. So far no damage on the back glass. There are a few minor little scuffs and dings along the sides, but that's not too big of a deal. And then pulling the $5 case out of my pocket and letting it drop. [Music playing] And it looks like once again everything is still in one piece. Nothing is cracked or broken anywhere yet. And obviously there are no dings around the edge on the stainless steel with the one that's inside of a case. So that's good. Okay, we'll try waist high once more time because I feel like that's the most common drop that's going to happen with people...you know, pulling it out of their pocket, or having it fall off of a table, and most tables are about waist high. Naked phone first. Pulling it out of my pocket. [Music playing] Still no damage done to the display or the back glass surprisingly. And the protected phone the one inside the case. [Music playing] Every time I hear the glass backed iPhone Xs hit the ground, I cringe a little bit. But whenever the one inside of the case hits the ground, I feel like, oh, everything's fine. Both phones are still working 100%. And there is no damage done on the back glass at all yet. Just a few little scuffs on the gold iPhone Xs. So this time around I'm going to be holding it up to my ear and letting it slip out of my fingers and hitting the asphalt. So we'll just be talking on the phone. Oh, that could be a bad one. [Music playing] No way! The back glass is still totally fine all the way around the edges. Okay. I'm a little bit impressed. Let's do the one inside the case. Talking on the phone and letting it slip. [Music playing] So taking a look. Even now there is still no crackage on the back glass. This is actually pretty impressive. Let's take off the case. Yeah, still no damage done. I'm impressed. Let's do that one more time. Okay, the unprotected cellphone is in my hand - the gold version. We're going to go ahead and talk one more time and drop it. Oh shoot. [Bagpipe Music playing] Still nothing. What?! That is impressive. No cracks at all. I remember when I did this with the normal iPhone X - with the very first drop we had a crack up here by the camera lens. Now, literally nothing. One more time with Amazon Prime's cheapest case. No damage along the edges. And no damage on the back glass, or the front. Everything is still working as it was when it came out of the box. Alright, so I'm going to drop it 2 more times, and if the iPhone doesn't break, I'm going to give away both of them on Instagram instead of just one. I honestly thought that they would break by now. Okay, talking one more time. Remember, this is a realistic drop test, as if I'm talking to you on the phone and it's slipping. [Music playing] It scares me every time. Still nothing. I am completely impressed. And the case version dropping from the ear. [Music playing] Yeah, the iPhone is still functioning 100%. No damage to the back glass. Okay, last time. Okay, last time. If it survives this last drop from my ear, Apple wins the drop test and I take back...I don't take back everything I said. Let's give this a shot. Unprotected iPhone. Up to my ear. Dropping. [Music playing] Right on the corner. We'll drop test the one in the case really quick before we pick that up. Up to my ear. Dropping. [Music playing] I just feel so much more secure when the one inside the case drops. No way! It's still alive. That is royally impressive. Both of the phones are fully functional with zero damage. Okay, fine. Both phones survived. The back glass did not break. I was proven wrong a little bit. Is having a case a bad thing? No, it's not. Should you have a case? Probably yes, because what I did here is not indicative of every single drop situation that can happen. I've heard of people complaining that their phone dropped off a desk and cracked...fell in the parking lot and cracked. Now it makes me want to take a Samsung phone and drop it from head height 3 times and see if it can survive. Because in my mind, glass should break from head height. Not really sure what to do with my life right now. Am I going to switch to iPhone? Probably not. I'm still kind of annoyed that these back glass pieces cost $500 to replace. Because even though it survived 3 drops in my particular test right here, doesn't mean that it's absolutely invincible. And glass will break eventually. Either way, as of right now, I am super super impressed with the iPhone Xs. When I drop tested the iPhone X, it broke on the first and second drops. So, Apple might have done something new this year...who knows. Over on my Instagram I will be giving away both of these phones. Right here is my Instagram handle. Go check it out. I'll have all the instructions over there. And I will be giving away a Xs Max on my Twitter like I promised on my durability test video. Thanks a ton for watching. Multiple drops from head height with no damage is very impressive. Apple is still probably not my favorite, but they definitely won this round. Thanks a ton for watching and I'll see you around.",

    "transcript": "- Hello there! (laughs) I'm James and today, I'm looking at (beep) at work, or I'm gonna try anyway. I'm gonna set up Cloudflares new 1.1.1.1 for families DNS resolver, malware and adult content filter thingy. We're gonna find out just how good at blocking the (beep) this stuff is. So join us, as we try to look at the kinkiest stuff possible on an LMG computer, on an LMG network, during LMG hours cause Linus isn't here. (laughs mischievously) Okay, I'm gonna set it up in the few seconds it takes me to explain what a DNS resolver and content filter actually is. So Cloudflares 1.1.1.1 is simply a DNS resolver which is the service that translates your human readable domain name, like linustechtips.com into an internet understandable address like 10.30.192.6, an IP address! With 1.1 for families, Cloudflare has added in basically a middle man that looks up whether or not that domain name has been categorized by third party providers as adult content or malware. All we have to do is type in 1.1.1.2 here if we want to block just malware or .3 if we also want to block adult content. Okay. We should be set up now. Now naturally, you want to test this and I don't want to just navigate to some site that has malware to find out whether or not this worked, but there are sites you can use to help you do this safely. So one of them is called fishing.testcategory.com Fishing.testcategory.com, this site cannot be reached. Its working! (shouting) Its working! There's also a similar test site for adult content This ones called nudity.testcategory.com That isn't working either. That's great, but how do I know that this test site isn't just broken crap. I need to test this in the wild. It's time to pull out the big guns and try going to something more organic, real life? Wait what other funny names... Gonzo? (laughs) - I did some research, I got a list of popular porn sites. I've heard of one called (bleep) hub.com The pride of Montreal It's not working. (bleep) g.com Nothing, okay? (bleep) hamster.com I hope this one doesn't work 'cause I don't want to know what's on it. Hamster is one of those words where you think does that have a p in the middle? (laughing) He's always hamping, he's hamping around. Okay no hamsters today. Is there like a hentai streaming site? (Andy laughing) Celebjihad.com (bleep) the fap(bleep) That doesn't work! I remember that from the early 2000s. Suicidegirls.com Yes this is working! Showing. Browser(bleep).com, Classic. Right? I can't get to it. This video is just a guy (laughs) how to watch porn if your dad blocked it. Okay, speaking of sites that I'm unable to access. When forfamilies just launched, there was a bunch of false positives. People weren't able to go to LGBT resources and also some sites related to reporting hate crimes and stuff. So Cloudflare released a statement and they said that they rectified it and I think that was all in the first day. But lets try some of these sites to see if I can get to them. Stonewall, how about that stonewall. Is that stonewall.com? This is just a random placeholder website. LGBT Foundation This is also not a real website (laughs). Why don't I start at google.com brokenrainbow.org.uk the heck? Is this real? Is this a real site? This website looks so bad it is looks like the type of website you land on when the website it doesn't exist. Well I'm glad this site was created because it looks like it has important resources. Lambda Legal lets try that one. That works too and it looks like they use Squarespace or something semi-modern, thank you. Okay, now lets try to get some erotic imagery just not on a blatant porn site. Like how about, a not safe for one, google image. What should I type in Andy? Boobies? How about boobies? - Artful boobies? - [James] Is this a cake? I think that's a cake. Yeah I think boobies in general is just too nice. Tits! Yeah, okay here we go, lots of boobs. Lots of boobs are coming up guys. We're gonna have to blur the whole screen. This can't be real, those are two. Is there sexy Minecraft? Is that another thing? Oh my god, sexy Minecraft Thanos (Andy laughing loudly) He's not even wearing a glove What the (bleep) Oh, this world. Cartoon dong, that's homosexual cartoon porn with dogs. Okay I gotta get out of here, this is just on google! This is google images. This is insane. All right, so we defeated families already. Okay. If I'm like a 12 year old kid images are just fine It's way better than a Sears catalog. How about a subreddit, right? I have a friend who says, \"Why would you go to pornhub \"when you could go to r/reddit(bleep). \"Its so real and cool.\" I mean its images mostly but I guess but reddit.com are gonna block notifications, yes I'm 18. And there's a vagina. (Andy laughing) Even the banner of this subreddit is pornographic like if you were trying to get your kid to not, I can't stop scrolling Goddamn it, if you're trying to get your kid to not look at porn then this is. There's so many ways around it. Like a kid doesn't even have to like one-up you like you might think its an arms race where you're like look here, I'm just trying to make it a little harder for my child so its just not so easy and my kid has to do some research and may have to install a VPN and maybe they make their IT dad a little bit proud, a tear comes to my eye. But no, this is as easy as ever. How about twitter. Oh, I mean this is blurred out 'cause this is kind of Japanese but okay yeah, here we go (groans aggresively) that's a big peepee. @Ittstore.com Well, kind of works should I be trying to go to different types of malware sites and seeing how, like this is brutal. I would rather my kids be looking at images and like scrolling through social media looking at short videos than having access to an unlimited library of high definition streaming pornography that they could... The problem is that you click through like fifty different videos and that's just bad for your brain so at least it mitigates that. To that capacity, it would work on your phone too, 1.1.1 for families is supported by the app. So thanks for watching Short Circuit today I think it's my lunch hour, you're welcome. I gotta go.

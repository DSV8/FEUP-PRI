    "description": "The Razer OPUS active noise cancelling headphones are here but this isn't the gaming headset people might expect.  These are ANC THX certified Bluetooth headphones that are meant for an active lifestyle rather than just gaming.  They're also meant to compete against the Sennheiser PXC 550 II, Sony WH1000MX3 and Bose Quietcomfort 35 II.

    "transcript": "you probably recognize Razer because of their gaming Meister gaming headsets the Razer blades and a toaster of course but now they're venturing out into lifestyle audio so this is the Razer Opus ANC wireless headset and it's pretty damn good it is going against the Sony MX threes the Bose offerings the Microsoft options the Sennheiser options and this really is Razer's way to trying to cater to their maturing fanbase and they're doing a really good job aside from the Razer text on sides for example there's nothing else about the design that there's really Razer related it doesn't even come in green only midnight blue and black but I feel like they're onto something here I like this design separation between lifestyle and gaming products but is this thing actually worth it let's check it out after this corsair dark rock R to be pro is the mouse for every type of gamer with 50 million emraan switches lighting bling two side grips for better comfort a type-c connector with 50 hour battery life and the three week operation mode with Corsairs a slipstream hyper fast wireless technology check it out below alright so the first thing I want to get out of the way is the price and 199 dollars I think it is quite competitor versus the Sony flagship or Bose offerings while still looking super stylish and part of the pack - the midnight blue has just enough color and the lack of any additional branding I think is intentional as to not distract from the three very important letters on the side that give meaning to the sound properties of the Opus and so this THX certification means you technically don't get bad audio the 40mm where drivers are tuned to not have any distortion at high volumes and generally are supposed to sound neutral balanced and pure and more on the sound later but yeah it's good and despite Razer's affiliation with thx as they own them we are told there is no influence in the certification process we'll trust them some value add duties include a short type-c cable with the USB a adapter a headphone cable for Wired listening with an airplane adapter which I so appreciate and actually a pretty decent carry pouch to with this middle divider for accessories but with a really awkward fit that requires an unnatural fold now comfort wise the headphone is light enough to simply disappear on your head with perfect clamping force and beautiful soft ear cushions I find the opus insanely comfortable and a much better travel companion versus my momentum Wireless and they fold into a compact package too and the ear cups swivel in words for a nice low-profile fit around the neck really nothing is compromised and all the attention is given for maximum comfort I appreciate that even the internal padding has some depth to smooth out any potential contact the driver underneath and they're also perfectly fine to wear with glasses no issues here the controls are well laid out with different height volume and multifunction buttons on the right side that are easy to find on the left we have the anc and ambient mode switch a power button plus the 3.5 millimeter audio port and USB C for charging so it takes four hours to fully charge this thing and battery life with a and C enabled you get twenty five hours of runtime which I would say for me is perfectly acceptable I have asked about if you disable noise cancellation you get about an extra hour of runtime but you buying this for the ANC anyway so keep it on now the crappy thing here with the battery is that there's no way to tell exactly how much battery you have left neither in the app as it just shows up as this icon without a percentage indicator and the power LED is either green for fully charged or red when battery is low it is honestly quite frustrating not having precise battery indicator on a wireless pair of headphones that you're most likely will be taking with you to travel whereas my son has a pair you click it three times and it actually announces how many hours of playback you have left versus here neither in the app no the headphone has that functionality now if you're running this on Android you get an actual percentage indicator in the Bluetooth settings which is awesome but they don't exactly aligned to what I get in my iOS battery status in the actual application so I'm not exactly sure how accurate that battery reading is and finally let's talk audio quality and noise cancellation and their whole slogan about forget the noise is 100% fitting here so using hybrid active noise cancellation meaning their to external and to internal microphones that work together to eliminate ambient noise plus the ear cups already have such good passive noise isolation so the end result is a complete blackout of world audio as you listen to your music with noise cancellation enabled and volume about 50% I cannot hear my finger snaps which is pretty impressive it's a bizarre feeling but also one that leaves me satisfied especially when I need noise cancellation for external environment what I'm travelling somewhere or using just a blackout and listen to music while outdoors I have experienced a virtual flight with these and the cabin sounds a lot more muted than my Sennheiser Momentum Wireless which is nice I do appreciate that we have the ANC toggle on or off in case you don't want to use it and when it is enabled it's like a smooth curve instead of the sharp activation they're also very faint audio cues when it is enabled when disabled and aside from the audio you cannot actually tell when ANC is enabled neither on the headphone there's no like light indicator nor in the app you can also enable ambient mode by pressing and holding the ANC ambient switch and this way it activates the microphones on the outside so you can hear your ambient environment and so you don't have to necessarily lift one ear cup while this one is blocked you can simply hold this button and everything around you is audible just like you are not wearing the headphone and probably my favorite feature here are proximity sensors inside each ear cup that have auto pause and play functionality for example if you have music on playing and you lift one ear cup it will pause the music it's pretty instantaneous you don't have to wait for it to activate when you put it on your neck that also does the same thing when you put them back on your head the music starts to play back and that is automatic without need to actually click on the headphone or on your smartphone and this feature is actually app specific so it works with YouTube Spotify all the major music apps as well so far I haven't experienced any issues so comfort is good ANC is fantastic what about that highly claimed THX certification and well it doesn't disappoint we've got plenty of power in here at the hundred percent volume it's a bit too much that I'm comfortable with I'm about like 70 to 80 percent the balance and the thx sound profile sounds excellent with good amount of detail and foreword presentation the bass is a bit too neutral for my taste but I would still categorize as fun leading that phone sound signature I will say my son has a pair have a more full body approach to the sound with deeper bass and more texture on the high end but enabling the amplified preset in the app gives me the the sound signature that I prefer with warmer bass and overall more character and this last point about the actual Opus app I'm a bit conflicted for example you cannot create your own EQ presets you can only change them through the app and not with a button combination on the headphone and all other presets actually sound pretty terrible it almost feels intentional so that they lock you into the THX or the amplified preset that sound much better than the rest but why the vocal boost for example sounds like you're enabling surround sound the bass boost is just like this mudbath and the clarity preset moves everything back with the slight expansion in the soundstage but too high we are told that they're still tweaking the profiles and making them better but they clearly sound nerfed thx is kind of the way to go alright so this is what the internal microphone sounds like on the Razer Opus and for phone calls I would say it's acceptable but it is quite disappointing I sound quite distant and in a busy loud Street which I am NOT at currently I think your voice would just get lost so keep that amount really the app features and the presets are clearly the weak points for the opus as literally everything else is well designed and executed they're extremely comfortable foldable there's a Type C noise cancellation is scary good battery life should survive for a while at all it sucks we don't have a precise battery indicator and they sound like a good $200 a and C headphone I'm excited to see this lifestyle category grow with the Razer and I hope you are too thanks much for watching check

    "transcript": "- Hey guys, so today I'm gonna be unboxing some new cases that my friends at Nomad just recently released. This is really special because these are cases that work with Moment lenses. This is a Moment case that I've had on my phone ever since I've been getting really into these lenses. I am such a huge fan of Moment. I love their brand, I love their photography that they post on their Instagram. Everything about them is awesome. And everything about Nomad is also incredible. They have a lot of really great products, much like this. This is a little AirPods case. You guys know I did a massive AirPods case haul with some really hideous cases. This is not hideous. This is high-quality and awesome. So Nomad did a collab with Moment to make cases that will house the lenses. We're gonna check those out, and also some of my little Moment gear that I had purchased not too long ago. I was working on my session for Vlog University, talking about different mobile options, and this is really one of the highlights, because you're able to take these really high-quality lenses, attach them to your iPhone case, and just increase the quality of shots that you can get on your phone. Just as a little refresher, here's the Moment case. It's been through some things. They also have these little straps that you can get. There's little holes right here. So this has been really cool to be able to just hold on to my phone. And this actually isn't a Nomad strap. This is, it's from an old Canon little PowerShot camera, but if it can hold a small little camera, then yeah, it can hold my phone. Let's check out the cases. I'm probably gonna go with this black case. Though the brown one looks really good too, and these are all leather. When I figure out how to open it, everything is, great. Oh, yeah. I unbox things for a living. (chuckles) Ta-da, (chuckling) there it is! All of their stuff is really high-quality, and oh that's really soft. It's uniquely rugged. Day one, day 100. And if you've ever had any type of leather products, you obviously know that it does wear differently. And I'm pretty abusive with everything that I have, so my day 100 will probably be here a lot quicker, like day 20. Oh, that's nice. Look at that. Look how gross my camera is. Oh my lenses are disgusting. Guess what Moment has. Lens cleaner, and then over here on the other side, look at this little thing! (chuckles) It's so cute! It can clean your lenses. And this is mostly made to clean their lenses, but guess what, it also cleans your iPhone lens. (brush swishes) And it's cool because this case is designed to have the lenses just screwed right into it. So that's why you have to have a specific case to use the lenses. So that's the black version, let's check out the brown. Oh this looks good too! Wow, oh Tyler's hype now. What do you think? This looks, this definitely looks like more your vibe. - [Tyler] Dude, that is, that's the juice right there. - (chuckling) That's Tyler's juice! - [Tyler] Bring it in. - Look at that! - Oh my God! - I like that it-- - Oh I love the gray accents. - Yeah, this looks good. Okay, I'm gonna put this on, just because we need to see what it looks like. You know what else is great, they also replicated the bottom design so you can use those same sort of straps on here, which is amazing. Ooh, I feel kind of sophisticated. Hi, iJustine here, welcome to my office. (quiet upbeat music) I don't answer my phone. Okay, do I need to get into this brown leather? That looks so freaking good! - [Tyler] Closer! - Can I get closer? - Yeah. - Yes I can, whoa! Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah. And that's not all. We also have an AirPods Pro case to match. Oh my goodness! (package squeaks) I also have this for my old version of my AirPods. Let's see what we have, check that out. Black looks really good. So let's put this on. You'll see there's a little dot right there so you'll be able to see the charging light. (gasps) (case squeaks) Oh that's beautiful, honestly, nothing says you're a CEO like, (chuckles) like this. Hello, yes, yes this is the CEO of iJustine Incorporated speaking. Oh you wanna talk to the president? Oh you're also talking to the president, yes. Yes I will close on the deal, please. (chuckles) I'm gonna have to take this call and transfer to my AirPods, please hold. Gosh, see, being a CEO is really, (chuckles) CEO lifestyle. (quiet upbeat music) I can't hear anything. Nomad makes really awesome stuff. I also have a really cool Nomad keychain that Nomad wants sent to my sister, but I thought it was for me and I opened it, and then I kept it, and then they asked if she ever got the package and she said, \"No,\" and I was like, \"Weird.\" A lot of times things are shipped to me and Jenna, but they will just put a J. Guess what, we both have the same initial. So J Ezarik, we are both J Ezarik. I think that this is the case that I'm gonna use for now because I want it to match my AirPods case, but I also, oh my gosh, what am I gonna do? Either way, these both look awesome. So, I think that I'm ready to carry on. Let's test out some of the lenses. First I'm gonna give this a nice little clean. Ah, look at that. Ugh, so clean. These just screw right onto the top lens. Now there are other cases, obviously for other phones, but this is the one that fits for the iPhone 11 Pro. Look how good this looks! So this is the telephoto lens. They have a bunch of different ones. I even love this little case. I can carry all of my little lenses with me. This is a little travel one if you just wanna carry two lenses, which is probably realistic. There's an anamorphic one, which I showed in one of my other videos that I made. And this is still probably one of my favorite is the wide-angle. And what's cool about this is you might think, well there is already a wide-angle on the iPhone, but, this will get you wide-angle night photos. All right, there we go. So that's just a really quick look at some of the lenses. Now I'm gonna take these outside and get some cool shots. And of course, some B roll of my new classy lifestyle, ugh, wow. (relaxing hip hop music) Testing out this Moment lens, this is the wide-angle lens. It's pretty cool. The sun has just set, so we're slowly losing light, but this is the perfect time to take photos and video 'cause the light looks awesome. Look at these little ducks! Hi little ducks! Hey, hey you guys! (clicks tongue) (relaxing hip hop music) Well that was just a quick little look at some of these Nomad cases that now will work with Moment lenses. I like this because it's a little bit different than the standard Moment cases that they have on their website. So now, you have another option when trying to find cases to use with your Moment lenses. Make sure you guys subscribe and hit the bell so you guys will be notified when I post new videos. And if you guys enjoyed this video, be sure to give it a thumbs up. And if there's anything else that you would like to see me make videos about, leave it in the comments below, and let me know what you guys think of these cases. And which one do you think that I should ultimately go with? The brown or the black? Hmm, I don't know what to do. (relaxing hip hop music) Everything is so small (mumbles)",

    "transcript": "- Hey guys, how's it going? This is my sister Jenna. And today, we are going to spiralize some vegetables. My friend Nick here, who is actually behind the camera, we all went to dinner once and he ordered a zucchini pesto pasta, but the pasta was zucchini. Not spaghetti. But right now, we're not making anything. We're just going to spiralize a bunch of things that I have in my refrigerator. - New show idea. Will it spiralize? - (gasps) - What if I spiralize you? Or skin this arm? That's not nice. - [iJustine] Are we building a computer or a space station? - Is there a link in your description? - Of course. Wow look at this! Look at all the things that we can do! So different blades do different things. - This is what we would want for the spaghett Spaghett wanna be. Curly fries? Oh. This says angel hair. - What just happened? Did I stick it in wrong? - Are you reading the instructions. - I have not looked at them at all. Body lock. Jam this in here. - Make sure it's firm. - Okay, I'm making sure it's firm - Okay - So I ordered produce on Amazon and I thought this was the zucchini that I was getting. But this is the zucchini that I actually got. This is very small. I wanna make a zucchini pasta in my future. So one of the... most important things is, is you gotta cut of the sides. You should probably wash your vegetables and frutas first. - Did you put the blade on there? - Isn't this a blade? - Was that just the slicer? - Oh god, You're gonna slice yourself. - Oh god! (metal clanks) - Oh. - Oh. Okay, give me that thing. - Let's go little. - Little. What is this? - That's a turnip. - What! - No it's a parsnip (chuckles) It's a parsnip! (laughs) - What's a parsnip? - I don't know. - Do we need like a bowl to catch our... - We do. - [Jenna] Is something happening? - I'm very happy with the results so far. Okay, so now it's getting tangled on the little nub. Look at that little nub! - I... Hate it. - (makes comical sounds) - It looks like a worm. - Oh I don't like it at all. - Wait but... It looks good. Turned out nice. Nice results . - I just wish that this was like a little easier to get outta here. (clanks) - Alright next up, curly fries. Did you get a potato? I wonder what's it's like to be smart? (creak) - [Both] (exclaim) - Do I just jam it in there? - You just jam it. - [Jenna Voice Over] Whoa! Wow! (whirring) Now I've never seen curly fries so thin. - See you're asking a lot from this machine. - Wow! This looks like your hair! - Leave me alone. I'm beautiful. So we're gonna try to spiralize some cabbage. Here it is. - No! (clunk) It's so big. You're going the wrong way. Yeah no you were. - Man, cabbage stinks. This smells gross. I just wanna say, I think you're all great. And I think healthy eating is very important. My god, what am I gonna do with all this. - [Both] (shrieks) - What would you do with that now? How would you cook it? What's your recipe? - I would probably put this in-- - The trash. - I would eat this in like a salad. They always put nice little cabbages in salads. I want you to hand spiralize this parsnip. - What's cabbage? - It's a fricking vegetable! - What's the point? (clunk) Food has to be at least an inch and a half in diameter. - So this isn't gonna work. - That makes way more sense than what I was trying to do. Get this gross... - (laughs) - Alien food outta here. (crunch) (happily exclaims) - So it works. - This looks way better than this one. How 'bout a pepper. (exclaims in disgust) - What about the seeds? - We pick em out! - So what would you do with that? - I put it in the salad. (pop) - [Both] (exclaims) - Smells like a carrot. - This smells like Pepsi. - Have you ever had a carrot before? - Yeah I don't like carrots they're gross. - So we're gonna just fry up these potatoes and see what happens. - You know, I've never seen potatoes look like spaghett. - I... Okay... So put it down. We've only got a tiny little small pan here. (thumping) - No! - Geezum man! - Why is this purple? Is it a yam? - (sings) Don't touch the pan. - (sings) Don't touch the pan. - [Both] (harmonizes) Don't touch the pan. Don't touch the pan. (clanking) - (gasps) Wait too hot. Hot to touch. - Oh wow. This is really good. I can't believe I made something. Well guys, thank you so much for watching. This was the first episode maybe the last episode of will... - [Both] it spiralize! - So if you guys have any recipes please tweet them to me. Because I would love to see them and I will experiment before I actually make the video. So I can make sure it tastes good. - If you have any suggestions for will it spiralize, let us know. - Leave those in the comments below and we will.. Get! - It! Going! - Spiral... No. - (laughs) (calming music)",

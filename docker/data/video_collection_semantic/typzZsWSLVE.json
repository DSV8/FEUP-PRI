    "transcript": "- The past couple years, we've seen a lot of virtual reality companies pivot to the metaverse, and today we aren't going to talk about any of that. (upbeat music) Later this month, Sony is releasing its PlayStation VR2 headset, a follow up to the first PS VR from 2016. The PS VR2 is the first VR system we've reviewed for a while that's pitched as almost entirely a gaming device. If you want a plug-and-play headset that supports graphically intensive virtual worlds with cutting edge features like eye tracking and something called face rumble, there's not really anything quite like it. But at launch, we're still waiting for Sony to take advantage of what it's got. Sony's original PS VR was an odd gamble. The gaming giant was going up against the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, a pair of expensive high-end VR headsets that often required buying a whole new PC. Its strategy was to go low where they went high. The PS VR paired a just good enough headset with a lot of hardware Sony already made, like the PlayStation camera and the Move controllers. It plugged into the PlayStation 4, a console lots of people already owned. Its promise was in its relative accessibility and ecosystem backed by a major publisher and the fact that it was surprisingly comfortable. The PS VR2 is a very different device. It's a completely new package of hardware built for the PlayStation 5, launching February 22nd. It includes custom design motion controllers, head-mounted, inside-out tracking cameras and internal eye tracking cameras, a feature that's not yet standard on all VR headsets. It has a vivid OLED screen with 110 degree field of view and 2,000 by 2,040 pixels per eye, and a 90 or 120 hertz refresh rate. And at $549 plus the cost of a PS5, it costs a lot more than the standalone Meta Quest 2, its biggest competitor in the field of VR games. Here at The Verge, we've had three people checking out the PS VR2, me, senior editor Tom Warren, and senior editor Sean Hollister. Our experience so far is that the headset gets a lot of things right, but that we're still figuring out how much Sony will give people to do with it. Sony's first headset required setting up a complicated cable box and an external tracking camera, as well as deciding whether you are going to buy its optional Move motion controllers. There's none of that with this headset. When you unbox the PS VR2, you'll get a headset with four built-in front-facing tracking cameras and a single USB-C cable that you plug into the PS5. The setup process requires starting on a TV or monitor and then switching over to the headset, but other than that, it's nicely seamless, at this point, better than the experience on Meta's Quest. Thanks to a feature that maps your walls and automatically suggests a play space instead of making you draw one out. Sony is apparently one of the only headset makers in the world that thinks you might wanna play a video game without everyone in a 10 foot radius hearing you shoot zombies, so the headset comes with a set of snap-on earbuds instead of the current convention of little speakers near your ears. That can introduce problems if the buds don't fit you, but there's a standard 3.5 millimeter headphone jack if you wanna substitute your own headphones. The Sense controllers use a layout roughly similar to Meta's Touch controllers. Each hand gets two triggers, two face buttons, an analog stick, a menu button, and a PlayStation button. It goes without saying that they're vastly superior to the 13-year-old PlayStation Move, but they also feel a little more solid than Meta's controllers. They charge over USB-C like the PlayStation 5 controller, and we got five to six hours of playtime between charges, not as long as controllers powered by AA batteries but not bad for a VR gaming session. Also, like the PS VR, some games can still use a standard game pad. We found a few pain points in our time with the PS VR2. The headset's easy to put on, just like its predecessor, and it's actually lighter than the original PS VR at 560 grams compared to 600, but although it's relatively comfortable, it's not as dramatically uniquely good as the PS VR seemed back in 2016. It's tracking generally performed well and it's way, way better than the original PS VR, but we occasionally saw issues like controllers drifting slightly. The screen looks great when it's perfectly in focus, but we all had to keep adjusting our headsets to hit that sweet spot. And most of all, that wire. Meta and HTC have sold me on wireless headsets, and although Sony's made that cable as easy to use as possible, it still literally trips me up. But Sony has laid the foundations for a solid VR experience. It's planning to launch around 30 PS VR2 games in February and March, and it says it's got over a hundred in development. One of its early flagships is \"Horizon Call of the Mountain,\" a spinoff of Guerilla Games' robot-dinosaur fighting simulator \"Horizon Forbidden West,\" but the launch lineup features several re-releases of familiar VR titles like \"Pistol Whip\" and \"Pavlov VR,\" or VR modes for non-VR games like \"Resident Evil Village,\" and we got access to a tiny fraction of that lineup. So we're still waiting to see how it's overall ecosystem pans out. How do the games we did check out feel? I'll let Tom take you through it. - I spent most of my time in \"Horizon Call of the Mountain.\" It's the PS VR2's flagship title. And while it starts off slow like a kind of Disney-like ride in a boat where you're appreciating all the beautiful scenery around you, it soon moves into combat and climbing. And I think this is where it really shows off the haptic system and just what this headset is capable of. There's a high amount of detail in the plants and the trees that surround you in the early stages, and everything looks really well lit. There's even a bit at the beginning where a Tallneck steps over your boat and you're just free to sit there and splash your hands in the water. Just check out these ants chilling out on a rock next to exactly where I'm climbing. This level of detail I think really helps with the immersiveness in VR, but I didn't always feel fully immersed when I was traversing rocks or going across wooden beams. And I think a lot of this was down to the PS VR2's hand tracking that didn't always place my hands down correctly. I also noticed some occasional issues with tracking during the bow and arrow combat and even times when a warning would pop up about bright lights. Still, I think \"Horizon\" does a good job of showing why the PS VR2 headset needs to be tethered to the PS5. We're still in the very early stages of this new VR headset, and I think we need to see a bunch more games to really understand exactly how the PS5 is pushing this hardware and to see some more flagship titles really take advantage of Sony's powerful console to really make the PS VR2 headset shine. I tried connecting the PS VR2 headset directly into a USB-C port on an AMD graphics card. Now, Windows picked it up as a second screen and limited the resolution to 1080p, but SteamVR just kept asking me to plug in my VR headset, as it couldn't recognize the PS VR2. Now, someone might just get this all working eventually but there's no official support from Sony just yet and no real sign that the company will support PCs in the future. I think that's really disappointing because at $549, this would be a really interesting alternative for PC gamers looking at VR headsets. - Sony is trying some interesting extra features. I mentioned face rumble a while back and it's exactly what you might guess, a vibration that shakes the face mask on your headset. Face rumble is a theoretically cool idea, but it can be distracting when it's harsh, although fortunately, you can turn it off. And when it's gentler, I kind of tune it out, which might mean it's a really intuitive, seamless part of the VR experience or it might just not do much for me yet. What Sony has sold me on is eye tracking in games. It's easy for eye tracking to feel either gimmicky or ignorable, but \"Horizon\" uses it in subtle, very natural feeling ways. When you're in a conversation with a character, for instance, you can look at a dialogue option to select it instead of turning your controller's analog stick. Eye tracking is also supposed to enable foveated rendering, which lets games render at a higher resolution right where you're looking, but it's harder to see the effects of that so far. Eye tracking isn't the kind of thing you should buy a headset just to experience, but it opens up new options for developers and makes the PS VR2 feel just a little fancier. The headset isn't just a VR gaming device, Sony also has something called cinematic mode. I'll let Sean talk you through it. - If you're looking at that $549 price tag and thinking it's not quite worth it, here's one thing that might help: cinematic mode. I am currently looking at a gigantic virtual flat screen television I can use for anything else I do on PS5, including PS5 games, PS4 games, Blu-Rays, Netflix streaming, and I think it could actually be useful for somebody who doesn't have room for a big TV in their house. You can even kick back, lie down, point the virtual screen up at the ceiling. And though you have to get fancy with pillows 'cause the PlayStation VR's adjustment tile leaves quite a lump under your head, mind you, it's not perfect, it's only 1080p resolution in this mode. And between that and the graininess of trying to look through VR lenses, I found that PS4 games, like the original \"Horizon Zero Dawn,\" were a little bit too muddy for me to wanna play, but PS5 games like \"Returnal\" work pretty well, and so do Blu-rays and streaming apps, though I did run into one issue when I tried to play HDR on a 4K Blu-ray threw me some error messages. - If you came here wondering, \"Is the PS VR2 better than the PS VR?\" yes, it definitely is. If you're wondering, \"Should I buy a PS VR2?\" that's a little more complicated. The PS VR2 catalog overlaps with the Quest's and PC VR's and it's probably gonna be smaller than either of those for a while, particularly because it's not backwards compatible with original PS VR games. You're in Sony's lockdown console ecosystem, so you can't check out new experimental projects like you can with PC or Quest sideloading, and VR is still a new experimental medium. And okay, I said we weren't gonna talk about the metaverse, but some people are using VR headsets for social spaces like VRChat, and those can be slow to come to consoles like the PS5, if they show up at all. That might change if you can get the PS VR2 to work with the PC later, but out of the box, the system probably won't have the flexibility a lot of other options do. But if you want easy access to great looking games, the PS VR2 is in a uniquely good position to deliver it. The Quest 2 is an excellent mid-range gaming machine that's fighting limited computing power. The Quest Pro has advanced features like eye tracking, but it's aimed at professionals. Valve set a solid bar for PC VR with the Index but that was almost four years ago, and we still don't know how some newer SteamVR options like the Bigscreen Beyond will perform. So if Sony brings a lot of PC VR games to the platform, it's position will get even stronger. Mainly, it's code for they need to bring Alyx to it. \"Half-Life: Alyx\" is so good. Sony isn't trying to reinvent the computer with the PS VR2, but it's made something that feels worthy of being called a next-generation headset, if it can back it up with games to match. what PS5 game do you wanna see Get a VR mode? My final answer is the \"Dead Space Remake.\" I played that thing like four times. I will play it again.",

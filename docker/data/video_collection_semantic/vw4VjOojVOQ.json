    "transcript": "What's up guys, Lew here back with another video and today, It's a comparison. I've got the entire family of Galaxy S6 in front of me. I've got the whole galaxy. This is the edge. This is the standard S6 and over here I have the new S6 active, and I'm pumped for this device for a couple of reasons. I started out Attempting to use the S6 Edge as my daily driver. There were a couple things that were bothering me with it It's not the most comfortable device in the world to hold. Oh... My phone is so slender, the edge is so sleek. Eventually what happens is you're just sitting there trying to use it Maybe your finger will creep over the \"edge\"... Inadvertently tap the screen, Trigger the haptic feedback, so on and so forth. It's just not the most comfortable or Thought out device in my opinion. There's just not enough. Plus, when it comes to having this glass wrap around the sides. So I moved over to the standard S6 Which is in the center here. That was a lot better. It's a lot comfier to hold sitting back on the couch lying in bed, so on and so forth. I wasn't having those inadvertent clicks, and now I had a solid place to rest my... fingertips. These fingertips. I just said fingertips Trying to make videos here. God damn it! But that said not everything was perfect in Galaxy land this thing is barely getting through a day of usage. I'm playing with phones. I like phones I'm on Twitter It comes to like, I don't know, seven eight o'clock at night, And it wants to be plugged in. It's a consequence of having a very sleek in glass looking phone. Fine. So be it, but the S6 Active... Improves the battery life... Significantly, what do we have here 3,000... Is it? 3,500 Milliamp hours of Power. That's a thousand more, roughly a thousand more than the standard S6 and as you can see the form factors not all that different. It's also waterproof. it's rugged, It's more damn manly if you look at it. Military spec, IP68, 1.5 meters of water for 30 minutes. We're probably going to test that in an upcoming video because that's fun. So you're getting a more rugged device and a bigger battery power users are probably gonna be happy about that. But you're getting some other things, too. You've got a sim. Tray that you can remove with your fingertip instead of a sim tool I'm changing phones all the time and having to search for those little... Sim tools... Just pushes me over the edge every so often Also, you have a really big tactile and grippy buttons you have a grippy foam! When you hold on to that, You know you've got it. You can do like we've done here, You can put some skins on your devices to make them a little bit more grippy these are from D- Brand of course, link in the description if you want to check it out. With this device. You've got that nice, rubberized, confident, manly grip. Other specs you're dealing with essentially the same device as the Standard S6, and that's a good thing. You've still got that great camera a really quick processor, so it's snappy. You're not Gonna. Have to sit around and wait now There's one more difference on the S6 active, and it's one of my favorite features as well, You have this little button here. They call it the active button. That button is yours It's yours to own in love you. Can do whatever you want with it. It could be an app It could be a webpage. Buttons are good. I love buttons. physical Buttons. On the front that carries around too, you have physical buttons for multitasking Home and Back. Now not everything is fine and dandy on the S6 Active side though. You're going to take a bit of a hit... When it comes to the speaker. It's on the back of the device, so if it's on a tabletop or even if you're holding it it's Going in the opposite direction of your ears. That's never optimal. You're also giving up one other thing, The fingerprint sensor. This fingerprint sensor is a leap in the right direction for Samsung from the previous version. But it's still not seamless. There would be times where it would miss Every so often. Not having the fingerprint sensor on the Active was not such a huge deal to me. The S6 active answers The-the questions that I had about the other devices, the things that I was a little bit... lukewarm about, it pretty much conquers those. This is a Confident device, something that I think is going to be really comfortable in my pocket. Form factor that you're looking at is the form factor You're gonna get. Essentially wearing a very slim case around the regular design. As you can tell I'm pumped up about this thing. I'm making the switch. This is going to be in my pocket. The Active is not gonna be available to everybody. Unfortunately, it's an AT&T exclusive, So I've sat here and said all these things that I like about it, And you might not even be able to buy it. I really wish that this device was more available. Maybe if we make enough noise, Maybe if this video is popular enough, maybe Samsung is going to make some alterations. I know a lot of you would love to have this device on your network. This is a beauty. So there you have it, the S6 Active compared with the standard S6 and the S6 Edge. I hope you guys enjoyed this content, if you did, make sure to leave a thumbs up down below, leave a comment If you have a question, or hit me up on Twitter. That's probably a better way. I'm @UnboxTherapy. Thanks again, and I will catch you on the next episode, later guys.",

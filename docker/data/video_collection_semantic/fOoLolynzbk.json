A dream to have shoes that do more than house his stompers. Shoes that work FOR him. After trying the Shift Moonwalkers, he felt that maybe we were close to having electric shoes that actually could be usable, but today a new contender entered the studio -- The RollWalk eRW3 Pro. Will combining the controls of a boosted board with the style of a sandal be the solution we've been waiting for? Probably not, but let's take a look.   Want us to unbox something?

    "transcript": "They keep getting me to do these damn things. Okay, so the company's called Rollwalk and these are called the ERW3s. But look at that, 32 kilometers an hour. I don't even know if I wanna walk that fast. That's pretty fast. I'll be impressed. What is that? You wanna go fast? There should be another picture where he has his arms out. That's how you really cruise. What else we got in here? These are the shoes themselves. They're pretty heavy. I feel like they're lighter than the Moonwalkers. But this is a different form factor, more of a platform, like they're taller. The Moonwalks had the wheels kind of more integrated. The radius of the wheel wasn't as great, so they were just flatter. These are a lot more like roller skates. And then a simpler strapping mechanism as well. Oh, you actually get a handheld remote for speed and stuff. Acceleration and brake. That is confidence inspiring. And then you've got your big fat charging brick. Now, of course, this is the pro model. There's a non-pro model that has less battery capacity as some smaller charger. And then some parts. Oh my God, I don't want my shoes to come apart. Oh, you can switch it up. It would match my jacket. That's cool. What's the USB key for? Oh, just charging this guy, I guess. Oh my God, it's Micro B. It's a Micro B. I haven't seen that on a new product in like four years. Oh my God, there's decals or decals. Yeah, that's funny. These look like they just stick on here. You know what? I'm gonna do a couple. Why not? Oh no. It's gonna wrinkle. Ah, it's still brutal. You know what? Don't look at me. All right, so let's look at the shoe. So it's got like a soft rubber kind of pad here. Pretty robust. Your sole, your shoe goes on. Be weird to wear no shoes with this thing. Very simple Velcro. That's it. A small amount of padding here. A heel stopper. That could be uncomfortable. No padding there. Okay, so you don't have to mess with the nuance of the super granular and continuous adjustment strap every time you can just, because it has that stretch, go and click it in. Is it almost magnetic? That is kind of sick. Look at that. That is pretty cool. Oh, and then you go this way to take that off. That is pretty cool. Then you've got presumably an on button and a little waterproof gasketed charging port. There's a charging port on each one. So you can actually take this charger, which is split and charge them both at the same time. I don't know what red means yet. We're gonna have to go back to our Literature. Pre-driving preparation. They call it driving. Synchronous remote control technology makes the two skates the same speed. That seems useful. Boom. Wow, look at the screen on that. That is like a Tamagotchi. That is low res, baby. Hey, but you want the battery to last in this thing. They want you to start on low, but I'm gonna become a pro today. I'll tell you that. You know what? I'm ready to walk and roll. Let's just wing it. Right after this message from our sponsor, Antlion Audio. You probably know them for their versatile mod mic, which is a great mic to add to any headphones or VR headset, but now brings that same level of adaptability to in-ear monitors. Finally. They work with almost any standard two pin or MMCX IEM, or you can grab their duo package, which comes with a pair of resin monitors. The simple design means no big mic in your face or headband messing up your beautiful hair. So check out Antlion Audio at the link below or at their website directly. You don't need us. You got Google. Go. Use our link though, please. Boom. They're on. I bet you could get pretty fast. As you can see, I'm an X-Man now. They actually sell all this gear. Be safe, you know. You're gonna be going 30 kilometers an hour. Got knee pads, elbow pads, wrist pads. The lanyard on the remote already broke when I was trying to put the lanyard on over this wrist pad. So your mileage may vary there. So far, my mileage is zero. Oh God. Okay. Whoa. Okay. It's like wearing rollerblades. Holding this with the wrist pad on is less than ideal. I'm gonna try to accelerate. Oh my God. Oh God. Okay. Later b****es. I don't know how to turn. The thing with the Moonwalkers was that you actually were skating and that kind of made it more intuitive. Whereas when this is kind of driving itself, I guess you can still do a skating motion to turn. Can I just lean to turn? No, don't do that. You got, oh, that's why they tell you to go forward. Okay, this is actually something that's useful now. And you kind of can turn by leaning. Oh my God. I feel powerful as hell. Yes. Power. I feel like I could probably get a lot better at this over time. And not look like such a liability. Hey, what's up, Jake? How you doing, man? Oh, this is regular. Hey, I'm gonna come over and brake. Holy. Oh God. I feel like these actually kind of deliver on what they promise. How fast am I going here? 21. Whoa. Okay. I think I could get reasonably good at moving around quickly on these. I don't know how fast you can stop. You can stop within five seconds, but I don't think you can stop in terms of like, oh no, there's a car there. Like fast, kind of scary. At first, I feel a little stiff, like I'm like, you know, whoa. But over time, it feels more fluid and natural, like more athletic. You can move through it kind of like skiing. Turning seems to be easier at faster speeds. On low, it was a bit iffy, but when you're going faster, you can kind of steer around things similar to roller skates, I'd say. And you definitely have to lean forward, especially when you start getting going, otherwise you'll fall backward. So I found that I preferred to have my left foot forward and kind of, I mean, the Naruto arms are just for fun, but you do need to be leaned over like this. But I think that as I was more comfortable, I would switch which leg was forward. One of the issues with these is the fit onto the shoe. I definitely feel like my foot can roll off. I'd rather this toe strap was up here, but I don't really feel like I have a lot of ability to shift that. I wear a size 10, usually, 10-ish, 10 and a half. I wish I could slide this forward or slide that back. Some ability in this plane to adjust them so I could have the straps at the strongest part of the foot, like covering my midfoot would be great. What are these? These are too cool for you, losers. We made it back alive, barely. Obviously that was a bit of a flail show, but I am confident that within like a day, I would look a lot more graceful out there. Definitely was happy to have these pads though, even though I was talking smash earlier. That said, the whole like five seconds to get set up thing when you have to put all these pads on, it's more like five minutes. So should you buy these things? I will say that I'm less likely to wear these indoors, like at the grocery store, like they advertise, pushing your car around with these. I'm less likely to do that, given that A, they don't have that intuitive walking motion, like the Moonwalks, where you just walk like a normal human and then the faster you walk, the faster they travel. Rather, these are just motorized shoes, really. So you're standing still and at low speeds, it's just more awkward. Secondly, you gotta hold this in your hand. How am I gonna push a shopping cart with one hand while my other hand manipulates this thing? Third, stairs. Doesn't seem like a good idea. These just free roll all the time. They don't have a lock feature, as far as I'm aware, so that I could actually press my toe down, like this is the only thing making contact with a stair and it's not gonna roll. Yeah, limited utility to wear them beyond your like commute. As for the commuting part though, they're faster. If they fit your foot well and you're confident in them, you could get places, but why not just get a scooter you can hop on and off? I don't know. And you probably pay less. How much do these things cost? These are 600 US dollars. The non-pros are 500. That's a lot. Scooters are also pretty expensive, but probably more versatile and resellable. And there's competition in that space. Hey, these are cheaper than the Moonwalkers, that's for sure. Those two products are kind of on the same hierarchy. So since these are like a third of the price, then that's great. Oh, they got their work cut out for them getting people to try to buy these and wear these and use these all over the town. So they advertise a range for the batteries, about 15 miles, and these can go up to 20 miles per hour. So if you were ripping at the highest pro speed, I guess you could get about 45 minutes of battery life and they charge in one hour. So just considering what kind of commute I would want if I was the ideal customer for this. I don't think it's worth it if you have a 20 minute walk to work, that's a short walk, but if you had a 40 minute walk to work and maybe no good bus service and this could cut it down to 20 or 15. I just don't think there's anywhere that these can go where you can't use another more normal, possibly cheaper and more versatile means of transportation like a bicycle or a scooter. It's just weird that you can't hop off and just be safe on your feet and like chill. You can do that with almost all the other ones. So glad I experienced it. I'm just not convinced there's a future where these are mainstream. So thanks for watching guys. If you're interested in this and you want to see other hijinks, watch me try the shift moonwalkers on ShortCircuit. That was a time. Survived that one too. I was doing more jumps.",

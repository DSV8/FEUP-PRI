    "description": "Autonomous drone flight: THE FUTURE IS HERE! Today we are taking  the newest drone from DJI, the Phantom 4, and programming it to deliver a package using something called 'waypoints'.  These allow the drone to follow a specific set of instructions using GPS, and the BEST PART is that when the flight plan is set! No pilot is needed! It is purely autonomous.   TO WATCH THE DRONE DELIVERY VIDEO CLICK HERE:   Here is Ellie and Jareds channel:   Current pricing on the Phantom 4:  A good carrying case:   DJI has apps that can be downloaded on both iPhone and Android.  So its the best of both worlds.  This is the same type of software that Amazon would use for their drone delivery system... just on a much larger scale.

    "transcript": "So Im headed out to fly drones with my buddy Jared. Hes a big YouTuber who lives close by me and has one of those new Phantom 4s. Ive had a Phantom 2 since about when they came out. And its been pretty fun to fly. Im not as good as I wish I wasI dont know everything there is to know, I mean, matter of fact last time I flew a drone this happened [classical piano music] [Brutal crash] [painful silence] So I might not be the best flier of drones but this guy, Jared, hes pretty good. (Jared) Ive flown once or twice, so. (Zack) Hes going to teach us today how to deliver something special. What are we doing? (Jared) So I have a little gift for my wife and were going to use some of the drones special features to deliver it directly to our house. (Zack) Alright, lets get started. (Jared) Lets do it. So weve got the DJI Phantom 4, the remote, and the little gift in the bag here. The Phantom has a pretty unique system called waypoints where you can actually control a set pattern, they call it a mission, where you tell it where to go, how high, how fast. And were going to set up those different waypoints to direct the drone where to go and drop off the gift. And you do it all through the remote control on the ipad. Its really easy; you just hit a couple buttons as you fly the drone. Its probably one of my favorite features on here. (Zack) So right now we have the Phantom 4 turned on and whats going on here? How do we set up those waypoints? (Jared) So this is like the main screen that you see at the beginning when youre about to take off, and obviously were not taking off yet, but that button right there, that will take you into different fly modes that you can go through. Were going to go to intelligent and then waypoints. Now obviously were not in the air just yet, but thats the path that you would take. And were going to take off right now so we can show you a little further. Just as simple as slide to take off. There you go. Now again to get back into the waypoints were going to hit the different fly modes, intelligent, waypoints. We have athey call them Missions, and so were going to tap new mission and its going to give us a few different options here. We can see how many waypoints we have, the total distance of the mission, delete the waypoint, and record the waypoint. Now you see C2 and C1, those are actually going to be the buttons on the back here. C1 and C2. So its really easy to fly and record at the same time. So Im going to hit my first button here. I just recorded that one waypoint there. Im going to fly forward at least 25 feet and Im going to hit record again. And I can fly wherever I want now as long as I fly 25 feet away from the previous one and Im 9 feet high in the air, itll be able to record the waypoint. (Zack) So Jared, is there a limit on how far away you can set these waypoints? (Jared) So I believe the max path link is 5,000 meters, so I think thats as long as your mission can go. And the biggest radius is 500 meters, there, that gives you your limits. And again you have to be 25 feet from the last point and at least 3 meters high above the ground. So once you are done with your mission set up theres a few different options you have here. You can have it Head to: Consistent with recording, consistant with route, or free. Consistent with recording means that the drone will fly in the same way that you had flown it, whether its turned or anything else when you created the waypoint. Consistent with route means its going to point to the direction of the next waypoint. And free means you can, like, yaw the drone throughout the waypoints. When youre done with the mission you can have two options: you can have it hover where it ends or you can have it return to the starting point of the very beginning when you flew off, the home point. And you can also adjust your speed from very low, all the way up to 5 meters per second. Once youre all ready to go hit apply and then youre good to go. (Zack) So right now its uploading those waypoints that we just set to the drone. Is it actually starting the mission right now? (Jared) Its starting. Its going to the very first point and once it gets there its going to start its mission. (Zack) Cool. (Jared) So now its starting. (Zack) So when you set the waypoint its setting how high the drone is and the location, like where its facing and stuff. (Jared) Exactly, yeah. Now if I was pitched or yawed a different way, I have it set to consistent with the recording, so its doing the exact same thing that I did on the drone. If it was a different point, it would point to it as its flying too. So there are different settings that you can have to get different looks as youre flying the drone. Were going to make it go a little faster. (Zack) Alright Jared, so now that weve learned what waypoints are, how to set them up, I think its time that we actually set up this mission for the delivery. (Jared) I think we should too. I think my wife is ready to receive this gift and Im ready to give it to her. (Zack) Ok, lets do it. So right now what were hoping to accomplish is Jared wants to deliver this gift to his wife without actually having to fly the drone to her. So were going to use the automated system to take the gift, fly it up into the air, all while no one is controlling the drone. And then drop it off on his front door step where his wife will be waiting for it. Lets see what happens. So were flying the actual route right now that the drone is going to fly autonomously by itself. So we started way down there at the end of the street, were going to fly the drone around this round-about, and then up the street over there all the way to his front step. And the drone will follow each waypoint as we set it. (Jared) So this is probably the trickiest part of the whole thing. Were right by the town homes that we live and were trying to navigate through all of the trees and brushes and everythingmake it look cool while staying safe. So were down the driveway but weve got to go that way. (Zack) It looks like weve got 20 waypoints set up already. (Jared) Yes, and were at a distance of 242 meters so weve got plenty of room to go. (Zack) You said it went up to 5,000 or something? (Jared) 5,000 length, yeah. So the biggest thing is getting around that corner with the waypoints. So Im going to go down here a little further. Now you can see here, this waypoint is too close to the one I previously just did, within 5 meters. So Ive got to go this way a little bit. So it gives you a little warning: waypoint altitude is below 32 feet. Maintain a steady speed and fly with caution. So basically its saying, dont be an idiot. So Jareds lining up those final waypoints; making sure that the cameras positioned right towards the front door. That way when he delivers the package, the camera will be focused on his wife, and positioning it so the package will be ready for her to grab. (Zack) Alright Jared, do you think its going to make it? (Jared) Im hoping it does. Weve set it up to do so. So I think with our powers combined we can make it work. (Zack) Alright. So weve learned how to set waypoints, weve actually set the waypoints for this specific mission. (Jared) Check. (Zack) What are the chances of this actually succeeding? (Jared) You know I want to say that weve got at least an 85% chance of this going through exactly how I want it to. I dont doubt the drones going to go through and pick the right way and everything. I think that that drones going to make it just fine. Where I have a little hesitation is in the actual package, if thats going to hit like a tree or something I dont know. But Im so excited to see. Im very anxious and I think its going to do well, but theres a small chance of something terrible happening. (Zack) Hopefully you dont hit any kids or trees. (Jared) Right! Exactly! (Zack) Alright, so if you want to watch the actual drone delivery for the very first time that weve ever attempted this, go ahead and click this link in the center. Ill also put a card in the top corner and in the video description if youre on mobile you can go find it there. Im looking forward to it. (Jared) Its going to be awesome. (Zack) Thanks a ton for watching. Hope to see you around.",

Factor in LGs first AMOLED screen in ages; the latest version of the companys super-wide-angle camera; and wireless charging and a Hi-Fi Quad DAC on every version  and you might start thinking that the LG V30 is the most competitive phone to come from the company in years.

    "transcript": "- [Michael Voiceover] I'm Michael Fisher, and I'm soaking up the scenery in Germany with the dual cameras of the LG V30. This is a first look. (upbeat music) Three things. First, this video comes to you from the IFA Technology show in Berlin. Second, it's brought to you by dbrand, and third, subscribe to The Mister Mobile on Youtube if you wanna see more. If you thought the V30 might look like it's predecessors, join the club. I was expecting another steel-sided monster from a key-grips tool box with gaff tape patching the scuffs. Instead we get this. A spit-polished glass sandwich of a smartphone that's much lighter in the hand than you expect. It bares a closer resemblance to the LGG6 than any of it's V-Series forebears. In fact if you put this phone in my hand and told me it was a G7 prototype from the future, I'd probably believe it. LG stepped up the industrial design, smoothed out some of the G6's rougher edges, and stepped it up on the specs front. Yes of course I'm talking about the usual stuff. The higher end processor, the fact that every model now has wireless charging. But more importantly, this is the first LG flagship in a long time, to ditch LCD for AMOLED display technology. The result is a brighter more colorful screen that should be more power efficient as well. The V30 also builds in a very subtle, almost undetectable curve to the glass, and it ditches the dedicated second screen of the V10 and V20. Building that functionality into a software feature called The Floating Bar. The strange part of me that's all for weirdo things like second screens, mourns it's passing, but let's be real, this is probably a smart move. Despite that victory for conformity on the front, I'm happy to say that there's still a party in the back. LG's dual camera setup is still the only one to blend standard and super wide angle fields of view. You can turn shots like this, into shots like this. This is probably a good time to tell you, the unit I've been testing is non-final hardware running incomplete software, so don't judge the output quality at this point. But, you probably can see that the wide angle photos don't have as much of the fish eye distortion as the pics from the G6 did. That's one of the big changes LG made to the steel side of this camera, and when you flip it over to camcorder, bam! Features galore! The V in this brand always and formally stood for video, and that continues to be the focus for this one. LG gives you 15 different color grading options out of the box for quickly applying a scenic effect. If you wanna go full manual, you can even shoot in log format, which is something professional videographers use, it's a means of preserving more dynamic range and tonality. Probably the coolest feature in my book is point zoom. You tap on a subject and start zooming, and the zoom will follow the subject as it crops in, instead of just punching in on the center of the frame. Naturally I can't render anything close to a final verdict after just a few days with a pre-production sample, but you don't need to be Nostradamus to see that the V30 is about to become the very best Android alternative to Samsung's Galaxy Note Eight. This time, it's in a package that's actually pretty. I mean it's beautiful, it's accessible, and it's still water-resistant and durable as well. In the Android world it's tough for anyone to take the spotlight from Samsung, but if any LG phone can do it, it's the V30. Pricing and availability are TBD, and a full review is coming soon, but I can tell you today that not many colors are coming to the US, at least not at first. So if you want your V30 to stand out, or you just wanna protect that gorilla glass five from your gross Dorito fingers, consider a premium vinyl skin from today's sponsor, dbrand.

Until next time, thanks for watching, and stay mobile my friends.",

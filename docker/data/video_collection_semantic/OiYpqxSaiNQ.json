TCL had two new prototypes to show off: a trifold foldable that can unfold from a 6.55-inch phone into a 10-inch tablet, and a very early concept for its sliding, rollable phone that had leaked back in February.

    "transcript": "(instrumental music) - Folding phones are boring. Look we've had the first wave of foldable devices and they're neat, but you've seen all that already. This is about what comes next after the current generation of foldables. Sling like the tri-fold from TCL, a wild new concept, folding tablet, phone thing. (techno-music) Unlike most foldables the tri-fold has two hinges, which lets it fold up into thirds . You can use it as a phone, you can unfold it once to use as a bigger screen or fold the unfolded into a full size tablet. It's not a half way compromise like some of the other foldables that we've seen which basically turn into just slightly wider phone displays. This is a full blown tablet. It's nearly as big as an iPad, but you can still fit it in your pocket. The screen folds from a 10 inch tablet down to 6.65 inch phone. You could also open it two-thirds the way and ya know prop that up it'll auto rotate so you can use in whatever orientation you want. There's a lot of weird use cases that you could probably use this for. The screen on this one is a 3k panel, but again that's just this prototype. We have no idea if the finished version will have that, but the tri-fold shows just how hard it's gonna be to turn these ideas into reality. I've gotten to play around with the prototype for a bit and it's really rough to use right now. It is incredibly heavy for a phone. It's got those big metal hinges and there are three separate batteries to power all those displays, it's basically three phones. And even though it's really thin as a tablet the phone mode is super thick and that's before your worrying about things like the software, which is basically non-existent. Durability which is a huge question or price which who even knows. (techno music) But looking even further into the future. TCL also had a very early mock up of a rollable phone. This is really cool idea that's a phone that has a fully flexible display that slides around the side and behind the phone. And it could roll back out and become a larger display when you need more space. The way it will, in theory, work is that there's gonna be motors on the inside of the phone and you'll press a button and it'll expand out from a 6.75 inch display to a 7.8 inch screen. Now that doesn't sound like a lot, but your actually getting almost double the screen space it's almost twice as wide. The whole system is actually pretty similar to the rollable Oled TV that LG's been showing off for years. Now again this is a really early concept, it's not even a functional device, just plastic and a screen that's literally just a sheet of paper. Is this a good idea? Who knows. It does avoid some of the issues of current foldables, like those easily breakable hinges and the creased display which is cool. But it's almost guaranteed to have issues of its own. Moving parts they're tricky. Now the tri-fold is just a proof of concept and the plastic sliding one even more so. You won't actually be able to buy either of these devices and it's not clear if TCL's actually gonna make products based on these concepts in the future. So why should you care. Well, first of all, because it's cool. I mean look at this thing it's a phone that unfolds into a giant full size tablet. And it actually turns on and runs android, it's like a science fiction prop. But it's also important, because TCL is planning on eventually making foldable and rollable phones that might actually look like these. Possibly as early as next year. The company says that it's experimenting with dozens of different form factors right now. So it's possible that phones like these, could be real one day. Look phones have basically been the same for the last decade. Black boxes with touch screens. Devices like the tri-fold or that sliding concept, even if they're not here yet, show off what the future phones might one day look like. And that's really exciting idea. Thanks so much for watching.

    "transcript": "the wireless game for mice options is strong this year and know my friends this is not a logitech g502 hello good people I'm Dimitri and this is the Razer basilisk ultimate a wireless mouse clearly influenced by the popular g502 light speed and g6o for light speed mice with similar overall shape like the angular front buttons glossy streaks adding complexity to the top area some support on the left side and similar weight and feel however this thing surprised me with a few interesting innovations that would make me pick the basilisk basilisk and I can't say that word over the g502 Lightspeed the NM xt 50 acts air cooler now comes in this gorgeous white finish with an addressable RGB high-pressure fan along with a patented air guide grille to increase airflow the vortex differential fin design helps increase air convection around the heat pipes so the your CPU can stay nice and cool learn more in the description down below so first let's get the basics out of the way the mouse only is $149 while the bundle with the mouse dock is 169 and that is a much better deal as the dock by itself is $49 the basilisk ultimate is slightly lighter versus the g502 lightspeed at the hundred seven grams and it fits perfectly and not slightly heavy Wireless segment as razer already has a lycra champion the Viper ultimate at 74 grams I really like the dog design not just the illumination but the entire convenience around it so you plug in the tiny USB receiver that is slightly smaller versus the Logitech dongle by the way the cable can be unplugged from the dog and into the mouse with micro USB in case you want to use the mouse with the cable that by the way is excellent it's perfectly flexible and light and spends 1.8 meters but if you do get the dongle you'll quickly get into a habit of placing this on it whenever you leave the PC so you'll never have to worry about charging this thing or using it with a cable I like this implementation the USB dongle can be housed in this bottom compartment where they cover it's a lovely implementation and a secure hold with the cover removed here we see charging points a power button and the profile switcher and the feet are 100% PTFE with a smooth glide no complaints here the main surface texture of the mouse feels good but it immediately leaves finger marks while the textured sides are rubberized and secure the grip the belt quality overall is pretty good my only complaint is slight rattle with the scroll wheel and the two buttons behind it take a listen in typical Razer fashion illumination is gorgeous wonderfully uniform on the logo the scroll wheel and the two side strips and they set my brightness to 30% and this thing looks fantastic all right so now on to some cool features and you scroll wheel with adjustable resistance and a new optional paddle button so the scroll wheel this one is my favorite the texture the lights I clicks the wonderful middle click but then we also have the option to remove resistance aka remove the scroll steps or add resistance for really distinct scroll actuations so at maximum resistance we have really defined scroll steps gives you a lot of control actually quiet loud too while at minimum resistance the scroll wheel becomes incredibly smooth and quiet too great for quite environments libraries etc don't get this confused with hyper scroll with large stick offers with that continuous endless looping until you stop the scroll wheel that is not possible with the basilisk but I love the fine and almost granular control of how how the scroll steps feel so you can have something in the middle so not super hard something like this or slightly harder I love that implementation and you have a pretty wide range of resistance to choose from now the paddle button by default is covered by a rubber flap into which you insert the paddle itself the mount is magnetic and it sits right in front of your thumb so for me Henry adjustment is necessary to reach but if you can comfortably use it you can program it to act as whatever macros specific dpi levels or whatever else now the primary switches are Razer optical rated at 70 million clicks they have a little bit more travel distance than my g5 or two they are also slightly louder but no complaints they're fast super responsive great tactility and nice sound too shape wise this thing is pretty comfortable great curvature of the primary clicks and nice slant on the right side it does feel slightly bigger in the hand versus the slimmer g502 light speed but the lighter body for me is significantly easier to aim with having said that this isn't my mouse for gaming as it's just too heavy target tracking and Cod for example is much easier with the vibe for ultimate or something lighter but the basilisks technically is an excellent performer with raisers best sensor yet called the focus plus up to 20,000 dpi with up to 5 DPI stages with precision and 50 DPI increments with surface tuning and lift off distance adjustment there's also this new sensor feature called a symmetric cutoff so for example liftoff distance can be set to 2 millimeters but if you lift anything higher than that the mouse will only resume tracking back at 1 millimeter I still haven't figured out where this asymmetric cutoff would be useful I'm the type person to set the minimum liftoff distance possible because I do lift my mouse quite often but it is quite cool to have tracking if you lift a mouse and you're like just around 2 millimeters but if you go higher than that it will stop and it will not continue tracking again until you're really low about 1 millimeter so yeah I know we all love to complain about synapse but so far I haven't had any issues of like it not remembering my settings with the basileus ultimate you can save all your dpi and your profile settings unfortunately for some annoying reason all your lighting is not saved on the memory so if you're using this mouse on the computer that does not have synapse you're just greeted with some rainbow puke at least your dpi and profiles are safe but like come on the mouse does hold a charge of about a hundred hours without any RGB in my testing with brightness as 30% I lasted about 40 hours and that is pretty impressive and especially if you get the dog addition you really never have to worry about battery life and that is why I would choose the Razer Basilisk ultimate over the g5 or to Lightspeed even though they're the same price point for the mouse only the hundred $49 the $169 price point for the mouse and the dock on the Razer side is just a better value if you go in the wireless direction I also preferred the scroll wheel on this thing better and it's also a bit lighter than the g5 or too light speed so for productivity and desktop use this thing is amazing for me personally and the game wood lighter mice but I'm sure many people will love this for gaming too alright everything is linked below thanks so much for watching how heavy is your mouse now that I've been using all the light mice around like the 50 to 70 gram range using something that is over 100 grams just like whoa a little bit too heavy but yeah how heavy is your mouse let me know in the comments make sure to check out this other relevant content subscribe for more I'll talk to you in the next video man I cannot launch Red Dead Redemption 2 PC they want problems",

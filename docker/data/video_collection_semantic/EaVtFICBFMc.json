    "transcript": "Welcome back guys, here's some tech news to put in that old Easter basket. It might not be chocolate, but at least it's better than Peeps! You ever had Peeps? Dennis doesn't know what Peeps are. Woah! Apple's gonna release new iPhones in the fall? No Way! Okay, that's not surprising but what might be is the fact that they'll reportedly be launching Four new models! Except I just told you that so you won't be surprised when it happens. Anyway, the news comes courtesy of a Bloomberg report based on info provided by People familiar with Apple's plans who also say the two higher-end models will bring back the flat, stainless steel edges last seen in the iPhone 5 and iPhone SE. The phones will reportedly have a similar module to the new iPad Pro compete with a Lidar sensor and you can also expect a smaller and cheaper Homepod speaker, which I know, we're all very excited about. If only just to give Siri a home for herself. Maybe she just sucks 'cause she stuck in the airwaves. Ya know, I think that's how Siri works. Hey, remember the Steam controller?! Ha-ha! Yeah... Look, I don't mean to bash it. If you have one and you enjoy it, that's great. But most other people didn't really, so it's a bit surprising to see a patient recently published by Valve that describes another Steam controller, but this time with swappable modules, so you could have one of those thumb trackpads that are infuriating, or you could switch it out for an analog stick. I mean it's not a completely crazy idea, I mean Sony and Microsoft both released attachments that could modify and add extra buttons to Xbox and Playstation controllers, so maybe this new Steam controller will take off. If Valve actually releases it. OOH! And what if the new controller brings a new wave of Steam machines with it? That would be not good. Please don't. And Chromebooks have had the ability to natively install Android apps for a while, but now Google appears to be phasing them out. Some core apps like Twitter and Youtube TV are now being replaced on Chrome OS devices with Progressive Web Apps (PWA's). While you still install these from the Play Store, they're essentially shortcuts to webpages that look and act like an app that's installed on your system. But don't worry Chrome OS fans, if you do in fact exist, this probably isn't a sign that Google is throwing Chromebooks in it's rather large, \"Cancelled Projects\" pile because this is actually a plus! PWA's require very little storage and use less system resources than installed apps. So, Chrome OS is probably doing just fine - until Google decides it isn't. Stadia's going strong though, huh Dennis? You playing lots of that huh? You're not. He's-no-he's not. Now it's time for QuickBits, brought to you by the Massdrop (DROP.com) X Sennheiser HD6XX headphones. Have you ever heard a sunrise? Well, these babies can get you there. They are one of Drop.com's all-time best sellers, with almost 60,000 pairs sold! They are based on the HD650's which delivers balanced mids and natural-sounding bass. There is a detachable 6-foot cable in place of the original 10-foot one and it comes with Sennheiser's dependable long-term support. So, what are you wait-just join the drop today! Link below! (Bad Singing) It's time for quick bits! Ah, it's so annoying how desktops and phones are like separate things. Well, if you have Windows 10 and a Samsung phone, now they are slightly more linked. You can drag and drop files between them with the \"Your Phone\" app on Windows 10 and the \"Link to Windows\" app on your Samsung phone. There is a size limit of 512 megabytes, but that's more than an email will take! Welcome to the future! We made it! LG is hyping up their next flagship phone codenamed \"Velvet\" saying it's the start of a range of new products that emphasize distinctive designs and tactile elegance. It will have a 3D arc design with a curved display. This is just a phone - this is just describing a phone. Why did I put this in today? Oh, to laugh at it. HA-HA! The Folding at Home army has now reached a combined processing power of more than 2.4 exaFLOPS! As the PCMR Twitter notes, that's more than 16 times faster than the world's fastest supercomputer, Summit, which can only muster a measly 150 petaFLOPS! I think we can stop arguing which next-gen console is going to be faster because the answer is us. Together. Instagram started as a phone app and had resisted transitioning into a full, web-accessible service regardless of the platform. But now it looks like Instagram had finally started to embrace the desktop. Last week saw the expansion of DM's to every user and starting this week, you can view Live Streams! You know, I just posted an Instagram like a week ago. Did ya see it Dennis? And I haven't checked in on Fallout 76 in a while, but the game is getting an expansion this week with new MPC's. The problem is those MPC's need places to live. And so Bethesda is telling players to consult the new map, to see if their C.A.M.P Site is using the same territory as the MPC's will use and if it is, they have to move their Camp Site or they will most likely lose it. This is such a Fallout 76 way of doing this that I actually kind of like it. At least they are consistent with their nonsense. And this is consistently the part of the show where it stops. So now it's over. Come back on Wednesday for more tech news, I promise you...it'll be eggscelent. I had to...I had to..WHAT?",

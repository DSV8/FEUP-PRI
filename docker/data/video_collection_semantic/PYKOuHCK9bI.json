    "transcript": "- Now, it's no secret that a lot of social media platforms tend to share features from other platforms and then kind of make them their own. Now, Instagram is obviously no stranger to this, and they just came out with something called Threads. Now, I feel like this is a direct competitor to Twitter, and to be honest with you, I'm not mad about it. Twitter, for me, was always about the people. It was about my friends, the people that I was following, random strangers that I would be able to interact with, celebrities, political figures. And everyone was kind of on this same kind of plane, like you were on Twitter to share and interact with people. So if you guys haven't already, be sure to follow me @ijustine on Threads. I look forward to seeing you guys over there. Now let's take a closer look at the app. Now, already when I'm on the Home feed, it's kind of populating a bunch of users who I've either followed, interacted with, I'm friends with. And since I just signed up, I haven't really started following many friends yet. So far I'm only following two people, Laurdiy and Mark Zuckerberg. And I love that this ports over your actual Instagram handle, so you'll have the same handle as your Instagram as you will have on your Threads. So, it's super easy to find all of your friends. So, the first thing that you'll see is the Home feed, and this is where you'll see all of your updates from your friends. Next, you have your Search field, which for me, this is populating a bunch of people that I've already have been following on Instagram. And it also looks like there's some suggested people to follow as well. Now in here we have our Activity. Can see my replies, mentions. Nobody's mentioned me yet. That makes me sad. We gotta fix that. And here's updates from Verified. Now when I click here, this takes you to your profile. I've only tweeted one single thing so far. (beep) Tweeted, oh my God. Do we say post? I've only posted one. Do I say I threaded? What do we call a Threads post? Like, \"Oh, I just tweeted that.\" Okay, I posted it. Oh my God, my second post. This is exciting. So, you could also copy a link to these posts, which kind of makes it seem like it's also a mini-blogging platform. It could also be a little rival to Medium as well. You can like, you can comment, repost, or you can quote post. I mean, if this isn't basically a Twitter clone that I think that we've all been waiting for. Yeah, it is! You can follow, invite your friend by WhatsApp, SMS, email. This is something that I really like though. In the Settings, you can take a break. So, you can get a reminder to take a break every 10, 20, 30 minutes or never. I think we might need to like add an hour on there maybe. Oh, somebody just commented back, said, \"I just yarned.\" I think I like that. I don't know, maybe that's weird. I'm not sure. You can also post photos. I haven't posted any yet, so let's test it out. Okay, posting. Can I edit? Because I meant to post Southwest PA. Can we not edit posts yet? We can't edit posts. (gasps) What if I make a mistake? You can edit your profile, you can share, and you can also go and check your replies really quickly, which I actually really like. That, my friends, is Threads. That's Instagram's new potential Twitter clone, Twitter competition, Twitter killer. If you guys want to, you can follow me @ijustine on Threads. And let me know what kind of content you'd like to see there and let me know how you plan on using it. I'll see you guys on Threads. Happy threading?",

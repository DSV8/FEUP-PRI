    "transcript": "A few days ago as of time of filming i posted this tweet right here essentially asking if anyone local wanted their pc restored and or cleaned for free now the idea was to show you guys kind of the before and after the transition the cleaning process figured be a cool like relaxing video series we could start on the channel because a lot of tech right now is either out of stock or just way too expensive to entertain and recycling the same few components that actually are available and are a decent value over and over on the channel just gets old and i feel like a lot of tech tubers are in that rut right now so i figured this would be a nice change of pace if you want to see a very dusty very dirty frankly sorry Courtney disgusting pc being restored in a video you've come to the right place this build right here is actually from a viewer her name is Courtney she also gave me another case so we're going to take everything out of this one we're still going to clean this case up so that she can resell it or do whatever she wants to do with it later she also gave me an ssd she wants me to move her operating system to that it is currently on a hard disk drive and we all know how slow those can be so without further ado let's get to cleaning hopefully this is a pretty satisfying process to watch play out to get rid of that annoying activation watermark hop on over to vip std key and purchase a windows 10 pro OEM key for fractions of the price of retail just use the secure payment method like Paypal receive your key in seconds and activate your os here bye bye watermark and be sure to use our new offer code skgs for a sweet discount now i don't i don't normally do this but seeing as though this pc is worse than i thought it was and i know this isn't like bad okay i i know that there are a lot of pieces out there that are much worse looking than this this is the dirtiest i've ever worked with and uh i'm gonna wear some gloves just to yeah play it safe and we're going to start by taking everything out of this case we'll tear down the graphics card we'll clean that we'll try our best to clean the internals of the power supply i don't usually like to open those uh we will definitely clean this stock air cooler it has seen much better days and then we'll clean the case remember we're going to transport all of this stuff in here into her new case which is actually pink so let's get right to it how long can we make this go all right so we're gonna clean up the graphics card first we've taken everything out of the system except for the cd drive which we can't transfer into the new system so i'll just leave it in there but uh this card here actually don't know the system specs i'm kind of learning this as i go uh r9 390 a gig of course so it's a fairly old graphics card it does run very hot r9 390s were notorious for running hot even in the aib forms so this dust buildup especially the small little dust bunnies we've got in the heatsink itself are not helping that problem at all in fact it's making it worse so the back plate um itself is pretty dirty as well this isn't really gonna affect performance very much uh we want to clean this up as well i'll show you guys a shot of the front um not too bad i mean considering um the cpu cooler looks much worse than this but yeah we're going to take this apart first we're also going to re-paste the gpu which should also help temps in the long run don't break away don't break away if i hope it gets better with time yeah i hope it gets better with time but does that mean that you're not there back to when i saw you it's a beautiful time in a deadly think i'm stupid but i get it now how long can we make this hurry up and spit it out baby don't break away i'll never be fine does that mean that you don't care and all right it is day two i finally finished cleaning up everything i ended with the power supply i didn't take it apart i don't like taking apart power supplies there's a lot of stuff in there that could either hurt you or just get screwed up and then the whole system could get you know nuked so i just cleaned the exterior of that kind of just blew air into it try to get some of the larger dust bunnies out of there but it's really not that bad it was facing down to begin with everything else has been pretty much dissected down to bare pcb i even took off the VRM heatsinks and the motherboard clean those you guys saw i stripped the graphics card down to literally just the board we've got like six or seven different pieces to reassemble for that alone the cpu cooler is totally deconstructed so this is a thoroughly cleaned build we just need to reassemble it so that's what i'm going to show you right but i get now now how long can we make this hurry up and spit it out baby don't break away if life and this here is the new case we'll be moving all these clean components into this is Courtney's pink pc case she wanted either pink or white she bought this herself she asked me to move everything from the old case which is obviously fairly old so this is a much more modern i think diy pc case i've never built in a pink case before this will be the first look the whole point of pc building yourself DIY-ing is that you can pretty much do whatever you want you can customize things however you want at the end of the day if you don't like a pink pc do whatever you want with your build i'm sure she's perfectly happy with the way this thing looks uh diy pc really knows how to torque on these thumb screws well the whole point of a thumb screw was so you didn't need a tool anyway i'm gonna get this left panel off you've already taken off the right panel now we were also given uh an intel ssd uh Courtney purchased that as well and asked me to transfer the operating system to that and i asked her if it was okay if i just reinstall the operating system from scratch she said sure no problem she only has like Skyrim and maybe like one other thing on the only other drive in the system which is this one terabyte wd black which was actually pretty clean i think this was added much later than the remaining components in the system but nonetheless we're going to set up the m.2 NVMe in this system we're going to install the operating system we're going to activate it for her using an OEM pro key from our sponsor std key and then we are going to run a few tests to make sure that this system is running fine and not running too hot maybe you know there was an issue with the reassembly we're gonna check on those things before we get her system back don't look back when i call you but does that mean that you don't care go back to when i saw your beautiful so a bit of a problem if you haven't noticed this case has four included fans which is nice for a cheap DIY pc case problem is they're all powered by molex and molex only like what the heck so um i i was just gonna plan on plugging in you know connecting molex power and just letting them run as is but the power supply that she has which is cx650m from corsair the semi-modular power supply does not have the molex modular power cable connected it wasn't included in the previous build and that's because the previous owner realized that molex wasn't needed none of those drives or peripherals he was using uh had or needed molex connectors so he didn't include it and i'm not sure if Courtney was given that cable probably not so i'm gonna play it safe and i'm just going to go ahead and upgrade her to a c or i'm sorry a v 750 gold we actually use this power supply from cooler master many times but it's an 80 plus gold unit it's a higher wattage than the one she's currently using a bit newer a bit fresher all black cables and everything but uh we're just gonna do that that way i know for a fact the system will run when she gets it i don't want her to turn on the pc and not have any fans running and then complain about overheating later on i don't you know that's obviously not what anyone wants to deal with especially when they give their pc to a stranger and have them fix it for them so fresh power supply going in here and uh we'll tidy up cables i let it control well we've got everything set up it works fine but it runs super hot and you were probably anticipating this anyone familiar with intel stock coolers knows that the stock cooler is no good especially for a 4790k even running its stock which is what this system is using a 4790k i'm going to give her a cpu cooler upgrade how about a be quiet dark rock four now this is what i'm talking about these temperatures are night and day different that stock cooler was just choking that 4790k with a dark rock four our temperatures are actually significantly lower than our gpu temperatures which wasn't the case before we were thermal throttling before we were at literally 100 degrees celsius and now we are chilling in the mid 60s which isn't bad nida64 is not going to heavily stress a cpu i mean it's still a stress test but it's nothing like say prime95 at the end of the day i wanted this to be stable enough for her for gaming for whatever she's going to be doing content creating the like and this system checks out in my book well here she is finally after two days and it was a pretty long two days i mean the first time here cleaning up the system fully down to bare pcb took a bit longer than i expected but this has really been a transformation i mean considering what it looked like to begin with especially in that older case just being able to clean everything seeing the before and after is just so satisfying cleaning everything was super satisfying it's like therapy for me and that's one of the reasons why i wanted to clean viewer pc pcs that it also gives me a different you know sort of content sort of video for you guys all to see so that we're not just doing the same things over and over if you guys like this style video by the way let me know in the comments below i do plan to do more of these i have many emails already from people who want their systems clean who live in the Orlando Florida area so if you want your system clean and you are willing to drive to Orlando or around Orlando Florida message my wife her email is in the description and she's kind of filtering through those asking for pictures be sure to submit photos of your build make sure it's dirty and that's kind of the point uh if the cable management's pretty bad that's also something i can fix up but um shouldn't take me longer than a few days to fix your system up i usually like to you know plan out a week but in this case here i finished in about three days she'll have it before the end of the week so uh this was super fun thanks again Courtney for letting me build this system or rebuild the system for you and clean it up now i have not installed the tempered glass panel yet the reason why is because the plastic is still on there and i want the plastic to stay on there i want Courtney to be able to do the honors and pull the plastic off it's her build uh that should be something that she gets to do so if you guys like this video if you enjoyed the process the transition be sure let me know in the comments below and by giving this video a thumbs up i appreciate that consider subscribing if you have not already and i will catch you in the next one my name is greg thanks for learning",

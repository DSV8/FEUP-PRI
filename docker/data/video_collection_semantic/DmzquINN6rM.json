    "transcript": "- Did you know that every day, at least eight tech stories happen every day? For more fun facts, keep watching this video. Google Apps usually get updated for security purposes and added features all the time, which is why it's super weird that in many of the tech giants' most popular apps on iOS haven't received updates in over two months. - [Man] Oh. - Like okay, maybe there just wasn't many security issues over the holiday, you know. The hackers went into hibernation. They need a vacation too. And you might think that's true, until you learn that the iOS versions of Gmail, Google Maps, Search, Chrome, Drive, Photos and more, well not more, no, and more, had their last update on December 8th, the day that Apple started requiring iOS apps to show privacy nutrition labels on the app store. Coincidence? - Oh. Developers are supposed to use the label to divulge how their app uses user linked data for tracking purposes. And it certainly seems as though Google isn't quite comfortable doing that. iOS users have run into error messages inside the un-updated apps telling the user to update, but they can't, they can't update. Google made a statement to press outlets saying, \"Ah, don't worry about it, it's just a bug, ah, Annie.\" Ah, shoot, dang bugs. I hate when they muck up software and draw attention to the fact that your personal data is being collected and sold, so annoying. - [Man] It happens all the time. - But who wants an ad that's unrelated to them? What is this, Boomer TV? (man laughs) I love avocados. Speaking of data collection, the hackers who accessed CD Projekt Red systems and made off with the source code for Cyberpunk 2077, The Witcher 3, and most importantly, Gwent, claim that they've now auctioned those assets to undisclosed parties on the dark web. And while there is evidence that the data was leaked on various forums, some analysts are remaining skeptical. Emsisoft threat analyst, Brett Callow, notes that in ransomware situations where the victim has refused to pay the hacking group may simply claim to have sold the information, even if they didn't really. - [Man] You know they sold it! - [Man] It's so gone. - [Man] They're good hackers. - And even if they did, as many of our astute viewers pointed out on Wednesday, it may be incredibly difficult to use that source code to craft an exploit that would put actual Cyberpunk players in danger, more danger than just having a PS2, or whatever it is that they've launched it on that it sucks! (men laughing) Gwent players on the other hand, are definitely screwed. It's all about Pokemon right now, guys. And the chip shortage that has affected everything from game consoles to cars has gotten so bad that American chip makers have asked freshly minted President, Joe Biden, to do something about it, Mr. Joe- - [Man] Wake up! - If that is your real name. A letter signed by executives from AMD, Nvidia, Intel, Qualcomm, IBM, Micron, and more asked Joe Biden to stop bidin' his time, and put money towards domestic chip manufacturing and research. Because a big reason why stock shortages have become so dire is the fact that most chips are manufactured in Asia, which was hit hard by early COVID, as well as US China trade war. And I know it's more complicated than that, but the takeaway is that the White House is apparently looking into helping US chip makers out. I mean, it's so hard to buy a graphics card that Nvidia may reportedly bring the GTX 10 50 Ti back in circulation, you know? It's rough out here, and that's sad. Like, you sold your RTX 2080 to buy a 3080, but those are all gone, and at this point, you'll sell it for anything that'll run \"Among Us\" at 1080p. - [Man] Please. - Now time for Gooligans, but brought to you by my good friends at Seasonic. When I think of the way that Seasonic's power supplies deliver ultra efficient, clean ass power to a PC, ooh, it makes you just wanna uh! - [Man] What are you doing? - Nah, I'm vibrating power, 60 Hertz. The Seasonic Prime Ultra Titanium power supply is fully modular, has Fluid Dynamic Fan Bearings, with hybrid fan control to mitigate noise, and comes with a PSU tester in the box. Like, come on. It's got a 50,000 hour life expectancy, and a 12 year warranty. So just be honest with yourself, it's okay to admit that you want this. Buy it today, the links in the video description today. Oh, really? You expect me to believe that these are quick bits. (blows a raspberry) - Uh, well, oh. (blows a raspberry) - Some large tech companies, including Qualcomm, are objecting to Nvidia's acquisition of Arm, which was announced last year but hasn't completed just yet. Qualcomm licenses Arm technologies to make its processors and is concerned that Nvidia would change existing agreements to favor their own chips. Microsoft and Google are also working on their own Arm-based chips and have voiced similar concerns. But honestly, I think we can trust Jensen on this. I mean, the guy probably wears that leather jacket to bed, or at least a vest. Apple has removed the remote PC streaming app Shadow from the iOS app store for the second time. Presumably because the app allows users to access other app stores through Shadow, which goes against the app store guidelines. But you can do that with literally any remote PC streaming app on the app store. Making me think this is probably about the gaming thing again. Look Apple, can we just stream games on iOS? Huh? If we play your Frogger game, it's a deal. I love Frogger anyway. Would that make you happy? I'm sure it's fine. Bitcoin is having a bit of a moment. Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey, and rapper and title founder Jay Z have announced, BTRUST, BTRUST. - [Man] B B BTRUST. - (laughs) A fund meant to kickstart development using the cryptocurrency in Africa and India. And MasterCard has announced that they'll support payment with cryptocurrencies, but only the ones that meet strict stability, privacy, and legal requirements set by the company, which basically none of them do. But I'm still holding. So actually I guess cryptocurrency is still kind of a mixed bag, but like imagine if cryptocurrency wasn't that. - Wow. - [Man] Cryptocurrency could be really cool. - Engineering samples of Intel's unreleased Core i9-11900K and Core i7-11700K have leaked, and received full previews with benchmarks by Romanian site LAB501, and Chinese YouTuber... I actually don't know how to say the name. But Google translate says it means two loaves self-control, which I'm sure is accurate. The takeaway is that neither processor looks particularly impressive given the hype around Rocket Lake, but hey these are early samples and I can almost guarantee watching the four of you when it comes out will be more worth your time. So subscribe to Carpool Critics. - [Man] And (indistinct). - And I have to admit, I'm tarting to love Xiaomi for their wacky designs. I just like the balls on these guys. - [Man] We will not be denied. - (laughs) The Mi 11 Ultra which was reviewed early by the YouTuber TechBuff, has a huge camera bump on the back. Like it's just swollen, okay. Partially because it has a little display in there that mirrors the phone's home screen. I guess you're supposed to use it to preview selfies but it's so small and dumb. - Yeah. I love it. They just Chuck stuff at the wall. Kind of like Amazon's hardware approach. Wait, what are you still doing here? That was eight stories, there won't be anymore until Monday, but if you want we can just stay here a while. I don't mind, it's Friday. - [Man] Yeah. - (blows raspberries) I don't wanna go back to my desk. - [Man] How are you feelin'? - A little warm. (man scatting) - [Man] Now we have to go.",

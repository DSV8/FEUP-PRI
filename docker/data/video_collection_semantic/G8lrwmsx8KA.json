    "transcript": "(upbeat music) - Hi, everyone. It's David Bombal, back with Neal Bridges. Really excited about this video. Neal is bringing all of his experience to teach you how to do proper pentests. So not theoretical stuff, proper pentests. And there's some surprises here because Neal, when we were talking off camera, you were saying you don't bring a huge backpack of equipment, do you, to a pentest? - No, no. That's exactly right. I kind of have a different feel, different take when it comes to doing, you know, physical onsite penetration testing, you know, internal penetration testing. It's, you know, and again, remember for folks who are new to the channel or new to talking to me, I've spent, you know, a decade in the military, you know, doing offense cyber operations, you know, for the National Security Agency, you know, and other agencies and things like that. And, addition, I've spent time in the area of operations doing real world combat. And so I've learned a lot in terms of how to prepare for missions. And so when I got out of the Air Force and started building red teams on the outside and started doing penetration tests for numerous companies, I never built. Like, I see some of these videos, some of these pictures, of people who have got like rucksacks with like 50 pounds worth of gear that they take on them with these internal onsite pentests, and literally most of the stuff that I've got fits into little bags like this that I can fit into my backpack, you know, when I go do a penetration test. And so I kind of wanted to walk through that methodology that I had so that so that you understood kind of what the thought process was as I go about preparing for an onsite penetration test and then kind of show off some of the gear that I keep in that tiny little bag that has been nothing but incredibly effective for me in 99% of the pentests I've ever done. - I think that's really important because firstly, if you starting out, you don't have like thousands of dollars just to go and buy random stuff. You wanna use your money as efficiently as possible. So it's brilliant that you're just gonna show us the stuff like you said that's really, really important. And Neal, I have to ask you this question just to set the stage. You told me off camera previously. You've done how many pentests, approximately? - I've probably done over thousands, 5,000 or so pentests. I mean, when you-- - 5,000, yeah? - Yeah. When you look across my time in the military, when you look across the several fortune 100 companies that I've worked for, when you looked across the big four consultancies that I've worked with, the MSP that I helped build, you know, out of the Midwest, the US, and even to date, you know, with my current, you know, work that I do on the side, yeah, I mean, it's probably up into that area. I mean, it's something that I was doing every week, multiple times a week for well over seven plus years. So yeah, it's easily between that or any real-world operation, you know, it's pretty significant. - And Neal, we can't say this on camera because I mean, there's confidentiality stuff. But you were telling me off camera, you did some really scary stuff in the NSA. So basically what we're gonna try and do in this video, once again, is take all that knowledge of 5,000 plus pentests and NSA / military experience and try and help someone. And let's assume like I'm that person. I'm just starting out. So you take us down the path like you've done so well in so many videos and tell me which gear would you recommend I get and how would I approach a practical pentest? Take it away, Neal. - Absolutely. Sorry, this is David. David, here's the deal. Neal, go. Awesome. (laughs) - That's what I like, yeah. That's why I talked to you. Go for it. (Neal laughs) (David laughs) - I'm gonna ask you the dumb questions 'cause that's my role. - That's right. That's right. That's right. I love it. So preparation is key. Preparation is key. I can't say that enough. Whether you're doing an internal pentest, whether you're doing an external pentest, whether you're doing a web app pentest, social engineering, it doesn't really matter. Preparation is key. And so I am a huge, huge fan of doing my prep work. Now that prep work comes in a lot of different forms. Specifically in this case when we talk about what do you bring into your bag when you go for an onsite pentest? You know, this is where this concept of OSINT or open source intelligence gathering comes into play. Now, David, you and I could do an entire lesson on OSINT and go-- - We need to. We need to. - Yeah, that's a huge rabbit hole that we can get down into. But, you know, when I go to OSINT a company to do a pentest, I read all sorts of stuff. Like, I pretend like I'm gonna be an employee of that company. If they're a public company in the US, I read what's known as their 10-K, which has all their financial statements, understanding how many employees they've got. I will look at all of their company locations around the globe, see what all their buildings are. And I wanna share my screen really quick. You know, I wanna share a screenshot from an actual pentest report that's obviously gonna be, you know, kind of blurred out for the sake of this video. But I kind of wanna show some of the OSINT that I do and that I actually ended up putting inside of a pentest report. And so when I talk about mapping the physical location, you know, of a facility prior to going to it, I'll actually use something as simple as Google Maps. And I will, you know, just take a look at the facility that exists. I'll take a look at all the roads that come in and go out. In this particular case and this particular building that we were mapping for this particular pentest, you know, I was able to quickly identify that this was the guard shack. I was able to quickly identify that this was probably some type of smoke pit or some type of gathering place out there. You know, this is the building. You can kind of see parking is all the way around, which meant that there were multiple doors of entrance. You kind of see the loading zone over here based on the location of, you know, some of the trash cans and things like this. And so getting a feel for this building, understanding what this building layout is, really does kind of give you an idea as to, okay, how many people are at this facility? Where are some of the points of entry? This helps you kind of with what we refer to as pretexting, right? Now, sometimes people get confused and they think pretexting in the sense of doing like an email social engineering or a phone social engineering where you're like, \"Oh, am I a credit collector? \"Am I offering you free, you know, Amazon gift cards?\" Like whatever the case is. Pretexting when it comes to some of the stuff, when it comes to doing physical onsite pentesting is also being able to understand just the area of operations that you're gonna be operating in so that you know who you might encounter, the types of personalities you might encounter, where your entry points could potentially be, where your exit points could potentially be. Yes, you do need to understand where you might need to get out in a hurry just in case something were to happen. And just kind of mentally preparing for that. In other pentests that I've done. I did a pentest for an organization in downtown Boston one time where I strategically picked a hotel that I was going to stay in based on where it was in relationship to my target. And when I got to the hotel, I already knew that they had windows facing the side of my target and I knew that I was going to be doing some form of wireless pentests on that target. And so what I ended up doing was I ended up social engineering the hotel when I got there to get a room that had a window that faced my target. And I did that kind of as part of my pretext as part of my pre-planning for my engagement, because I knew that I would need that window access for any of the wireless type of activity that I would do. And so that planning piece is incredibly important. And I think that that's something we don't talk enough about in the pentesting space is the amount of planning that you need to do into doing an operation or to do a pentest. And so when you do that type of planning, David, that's how you get to understanding that you don't need a rucksack full of gear to do an onsite pentest. You probably only need a handful of things if you've done your planning appropriately. I actually viewed that if you took a rucksack full of gear, you haven't done your planning. Your planning for everything when you haven't done proper planning in the first place. - Would you, however, like leave a bunch of extra stuff in the back of your car or something like that, if you could. - Depending on how far you had to travel for the engagement. And this gets to the logistics of how you're conducting a pentest engagement, right? If you're getting on a plane and going somewhere and weight is an issue, right, during your travels, then you can kind of take into Neal's kind of top three, right? Good, better, best, right? Good is if weight's a concern, travel restrictions are a concern. You know, you're already loaded up with laptops and, you know, everything else that you need. You know, you take the minimum with you on the plane, and then obviously you scale up from there and then yes, you can leave it in the hotel or you can leave it in the, you know, in the car if you need to. If you're driving to a pentest location, then obviously it makes it a lot easier because then you can throw a whole bunch of stuff in the back of your car. I've never personally run into that. I've never personally run into a scenario where I got to a site and I didn't need anything more than an ethernet cable. Like, right? Like an ethernet cable goes bad and I got to go get an ethernet cable. Or I run out a USB dongles, right? And I need to go get a USB dongle. That's like the worst case scenario that I've ever encountered. But I've never gotten anywhere and said, \"Gosh, I wish I had another, a Hak5 Pineapple. \"I wish I'd brought my 50 other that I had at the house.\" Right? I knew exactly how many I needed to bring. - So that's really interesting after like 5,000 plus pentests. Because you did the preparation, you had the right tools for the job. - Yeah. Yeah. And that's something I'm a huge fan of is bring the right tools for the right job, right? Know what you're getting into. - So, I mean, Neal, I mean, I don't know if you wanted to talk more about that, but I'm really keen to see. Okay, so what are these tools? Can you give us some examples of like the top? And I'm gonna spring a surprise on you. At some point during this, I need to know your top three tools. (Neal laughs) - 'Cause we do everything in threes. - We do. We do everything in threes. So I wish I had one of those top view cameras 'cause I'd lay out everything that I had here on my desk. - Don't worry, I'll (indistinct). - All right. Good. All right, good. 'Cause I've got quite a lot here. Now, everything that I do have here does fit into this bag. I didn't take everything out of this bag and I'll kind of show some of the... You know, the only thing that I've got left in this bag are really things like extra cables, you know, extra USB dongles and things like that. That's really all that's left in the bag, so that people don't be like, \"Oh, well, what else does he have in the bag?\" It's things like you know, extra ethernet cable right on a ribbon that you could like pull. - It's a Hak5 one? - Yeah, it's a Hak5 one. That's that's super helpful, super useful to do that. So that's all that's left in the bag for the most part. - It looks like, you know, Hak5 seem to be... And just before we continue, Hak5 is not sponsoring this video. - No, no, Hak5 is not. - But we'll have to get some sponsors, but Hak5 isn't sponsoring this video. It looks like the Hak5 stuff is like a necessity almost because you're using a Hak5 bag, you've already got one cable at Hak5. All your top tools like Hak5 (indistinct). - I'll show you some stuff that's not Hak5. There is quite a lot. Here's the thing. Hak5 has come a long way over the years. And again, to your point, right? Hak5 not sponsor this video. I'm not hocking anything Hak5 related. But I have watched them grow over the years and I think that they have put together a lot of really good, you know, really good tools. And so there will be a lot of Hak5 stuff here. And here's why. Here's why. And you've done a video on the Rubber Ducky, right? I think the Rubber Ducky is unequivocally a perfect example where Hak5 took something that we all love to do and put it into something that you can buy with a swipe of a credit card and have it delivered to your door in a few weeks, give or take, you know, supply issues and whatnot. And that's genius. That's genius. They're obviously not the only one and there's other vendors out there that have done some really good stuff and put together some really good hardware, but I definitely give credit to Hak5 for commercializing, you know, commoditizing some of this physical hardware. And so, yeah, I mean, as a pentest or as an advocate, 10 of 10. Get my support for making something that I, as a corporate pentester, when I think about the needs who go swipe a credit card and buy gear that I can spread out across a pentesting team or that I can have in go bags so that I can, you know, quickly use to do multiple pentests in an organization, absolutely. I know the pentesting director for a very, very large consulting company. And when they were expanding their pentesting team, they didn't buy all Hak5 stuff. It was some of the other stuff that I've got here. You know, I'll be able to demonstrate, kind of show you some of that stuff as well. But yes, a large portion of their purchase was going to Hak5 and buying 10 Pineapples, 10 Rubber Duckies, 10 LAN Turtles, right? And things like that, that they would put into bags that they would then give to their pentesters before they headed out into the field. - Yeah, I mean, I'll make this point, 'cause I've seen Darren from Hak5 say something along these lines. Sure, you can create your own products. So you could create something like the Rubber Ducky. You can create your own versions of these. And if you wanna do that, that's brilliant. But for a lot of people, especially when you starting, you know, the level of knowledge required to create something that's useful and small to use in the field is hard. It's much easier if you can afford it, just like you said, for like a company just to buy it. It's pre-made. The tooling has been all done. It's a small package and you know it's gonna work. So it's much easier (indistinct). - Let me piggyback onto that with a, just a different perspective, a different flip of the coin, right? - [David] Yeah. - Your time is worth something, David. Your time is money. - [David] Sure. - And let's talk about the first tool where I can really, really articulate that, right? So the first tool right out of my bag that I carry with me everywhere is a Proxmark. Now this is one of the newer generation Proxmarks. This one's... That was probably not gonna show very well, right? But you've got these extra cards here for it. Got a Proxmark RFID reader. And so, you know, if you've ever seen, I'm sure most of you have seen, and David I'm gonna ask you to sensor these out just to make sure I don't disclose anything here, right? But we've got various types of cards that we've collected over the years. When you look at the back of these cards and I'll trust you to find some B-roll or something like that, down at the bottom of this card, you'll have HID, which is one of the major brands of RFID card producers that are out there. Proxmark is something that I have in my bag all the time, 100% of the time for various types of RFID badge reading and cloning. Well, so I got in my early days of pentesting, I got this fancy idea that I was going to take on the Bishop Fox challenge of building a backpack with the massive RFID reader in it, where you take like an RFID reader from a parking garage, you take a huge battery pack, you put it in the back of the backpack and then you attach Proxmark to it and you sit outside of a building and scan badges all day long. A, that was not an easy thing to build. And I don't mean that in like a old, \"Hey, I like a challenge.\" There's only one set of directions. Imagine building a Lego, David, where there's only one set of directions of how one person built it and nobody else has ever built it before in your life. And so if you don't build it exactly the way that they build it and you have the first problem with it, you're literally troubleshooting it your first time, right? So that's kind of problem number one. You get this thing out there. And I had done this on a pentest in Midtown New York, right? And I was like, \"Oh, I'm gonna go. \"This is gonna be fantastic. \"This is gonna be where I'm gonna do this pentest. \"I'm gonna do this in Midtown New York.\" And I knew that I was attacking a hedge fund company that was in like the 80th floor of one of the big buildings in New York. So I stood outside that building with my backpack, with my RFID reader in it, and I was just scanning cards left and right, right? When I got back to the hotel to look at it, you know what I didn't realize because of poor planning? - What? - I couldn't tell which RFID was to the floor that I needed access to. (laughs) - I think you mentioned this previously when we spoke about it. You just had numbers. Is that why? - You just have numbers. You just have numbers. It's not like when you swipe this card. Or actually I shouldn't. When you swipe this card at a badge reader, right? It's not like it says, \"Oh, this is person a ABC. \"They get access to building 123, you know, \"and boy, they got security clearance level 4,000.\" Right? \"To do it.\" Right? That's not how... I'm sorry. I dropped dropped a piece of equipment. That's just not how those numbers come across. When you swipe that badge, it's literally like a 16, 32, 54 string of numbers and that numerical number then ties into the badge reader system that then determines whether that numerical number has access or doesn't have access. It's a very binary type of thing to that badge reader system. So you get back to process literal tens of thousands of cards that you've scanned as you've walked from the hotel to the building, and then stood in front of the building and then walked back, you've realized that you've got more data than you know what to do with and it's completely and totally useless. - How long did it take you to build a thing? - It took me about three months to build it, to get it right, to build it, yeah. But this gets back to my original point, right? Your time is worth something. Your time is worth something. And so when you're conducting a pentest, do you have time to build three months worth of a piece of equipment that seems really, really cool on the internet, that seems like a fun, cool project that people built on the internet, that legitimately has no practical use whatsoever? And so that's the part that I encourage people to do is like, yeah, it may seem fun to build your own Rubber Ducky or to build your own backpack, you know, facing RFID cloner, or build your own anything else, but is that necessarily how you need to spend your time? Is that the best use of your time? And is there something else that you could better be doing to hone your trade craft? And that's something you'll hear me talk about as we do more of these videos, David, is honing your trade craft. Building an RFID reader in your backpack doesn't do jack for your trade craft. Doesn't do Jack for your trade craft. - So getting back to that device, the Proxmark device, can you, just for people who don't know, 'cause let's assume I know nothing, what does it actually do? Just give us a little 30 seconds. - Absolutely. So you would take this Proxmark. So you take this little device like this right here. You would hook it up to, you know, a laptop. You'd pre-program this one. You could hook this one up to a battery source so that it would run, you know, kind of in the palm of your hand. And there's a couple different ways you do it. And this is where you have to get into this idea that this doesn't get you access to the building, right? This doesn't get you, this alone, right? Because you can't just simply sit up there and be like, \"Hey, let me scan your card. \"Hey, let me scan your card.\" You know, that doesn't work like that. You've got to have, back to our planning, you've got to have what your pretext is. And so if I go back to the example that I used before with that one building, knowing where the smoke pit was, right? I took my backpack, had my laptop in there. I had a USB cable that was coming out of my backpack into a reader like this, that I had my hand. And then you'd have the Proxmark software running on it. I stood at the smoke pit and it's really simple, David. It's really simple. I have badges around my neck. So obviously I belong to the company because I've got badges around my neck, just like everybody else at the company does. So I look just like everybody else there. And so as part of having badges around my neck and as part of my pretext, I said, \"Hey, I'm working with security. \"We're testing the door locks here on this building. \"I need to check your badge \"and make sure that you have the right access levels.\" And so most employees are like, \"Oh, absolutely. \"Whatever security needs.\" And so I'll take this in my hand, I'll do like this. I'll nod my head up and down and be like, \"Okay, it looks like your badge is good. \"You should be able to walk into the building now.\" They'd swipe it, get into the building and they'd walk right in. And I've just collected a known good badge by standing outside of the smoke pit. - You weren't at the door. You were just in the smoke pit. Is that right? - Just in the smoke pit. So if I go back to that picture, just inside of that little covered building, just inside of that smoke pit. Because the smoke pit typically isn't behind any type of fencing. This is where people are out there chilling anyway. They genuinely wanna be left alone. Remember social engineering is about the psychology with people. And so, you know, they're not on their guard. They're used to communicating and just BSing and talking with folks that are in the smoke pit anyway, and so their guard is down. And so it's really easy to walk up to them with almost any pretext that you've got and be like, \"Hey, \"you know, \"I need to swipe your badge \"because we were having some problems with \"the door lock mechanism \"and I wanna make sure you're not gonna have any problems \"getting back in when you're at the end of your smoke break.\" Think about it this way. If you're at a place that does manufacturing and you've got factory line workers who are taking their smoke break, right? Those folks are often on very, very tight time schedules. Their managers watch them very, very closely to be like, \"Oh, you go take a 10 minute smoke break, \"but then you got to come right back in.\" Right? And so they don't wanna be bothered with having to not be able to get back into the building. And so thinking like that goes, okay, my pretext is gonna be, \"Hey, I don't want you to get locked out of the building. \"I need to double check your badge \"because we're having issues with the badge reader system. \"Can I check it real quick and make sure everything's okay?\" \"Yeah, absolutely.\" Boom. Now you've specifically targeted somebody and you specifically recorded your badge. Now what happens is on your laptop... Man, I'm dropping all sorts of crap these days. I got desk full of stuff here. So now on your laptop, you've taken the unique number of this badge and you've recorded it on your laptop. You can now go back to your car and you can take one of your cloner cards, which these guys usually give you some type of cloner card or you can get these pretty cheap on eBay. And then you can do, basically, a process whereby you take that number that you just recorded here, use the Proxmark software, write that number to this type of card, and now you have your own card that you can use to swipe to get into the building anytime you want. So that would be how I would do it is I would go out there at social engineer a bunch of people, get their cards, and then I would take their card, clone it, and use that to get into the front door. And so now you think about this from a pentesting perspective, we wanna be able to tell the story on the report that we cloned the badge and then we walked right in the front door with a badge of our own, walked right past security at the front door and got into your building through cloning a badge. - Yeah. I mean, we will have to do a whole section on this but like, I think you've mentioned it before. Social engineering skills. Would you say social engineering skills are as important or more important than having a bunch of tech? - Oh, more important. More important. We forgot to do this analogy in the opener when we talked about this, but that's a fantastic lead in. There's a great movie out there. You know, it's Spy Game with Robert Redford and Brad Pitt, right? And there's a section of the clip of the movie, you know, Brad Pitt is this aspiring CIA agent. And he's thinking he's gonna be all James Bondy, 007ish. You know, he's gonna have gadgets and twisty watches and all this other stuff when he comes out of this thing. Robert Redford being the seasoned, you know, expert at the CIA. So, you know, Robert Redford says at one point in time to to his trainee. He goes, \"Technology changes all the time and that's fine. \"Oftentimes all you need is \"a packet of chewing gum and a smile \"to get into most places.\" Right? And that truly is what I think the core of pentesting is like all this tech is fantastic, but at some point in time, you're gonna need some social engineering skills to use most of this tech on an onsite pentest. Otherwise, listen, when you do an onsite pentest, if you walk in the front door and you're talking to security and you're like, \"Hey, I'm here to do an onsite pentest. \"Can I see your director of cybersecurity?\" And they come up there and they walk you around the building and be like, \"Hi, this is Neal. \"He's here to do an onsite pentest.\" \"Hi, this is Neal. \"He's here to test our onsite security.\" You know, and then I sit down there and I'm like, \"Cool. \"I'm going to take this device. \"I'm gonna plug it into the back of your computer \"and, you know, it's gonna give me \"a shell out to the whole world.\" Anybody who's ever had to debrief a non-technical person is gonna go, \"Well, that would never happen \"so this test is completely invalid.\" - [David] Yeah. Yeah. - Right? And I think that that's what people forget is like tech is fantastic but the non-technical person is gonna be like, you would never get access to my facility to be able to use that tech and so this test is completely and totally invalid. And so by social engineering your way into that building and building that into your statement of work, you show to them that not only can you social engineer your way into the building to use said tech, this is exactly why a holistic security principle and methodology is incredibly important. So back to your original question, social engineering is ridiculously important. - Yeah, I mean, it's all about convincing people to do something that they shouldn't do. - We should... There's a concept called the pyramid of pain and it's oftentimes referred to when it comes to cyber defense. But on the pentesting side, physical access is king, right? When I get access to your card, when I clone your badge card, when I call on your badges and I can get physical access to your building, I can do anything I wanna do. Period dot. Right? That is like you're gonna get domain admin when you get physical access. I probably shouldn't say that there's no definitive answer to whether you would get domain admin, but your chances of getting domain admin or getting to your crown jewels, getting to whatever your objective that pentest is is up exponentially when you get physical access to it. Right? And so all these tools are fun if you can get physical access. But if you can't get physical access, then all these tools are pretty much useless. - So, I mean, the first tool that you showed us was like, how do you get past the door? What's the next the tool? What's your next tool? - Absolutely. So let's put this off to the side here. So we're in the door. We're in the facility. We have a lot more at our disposal once we get in, obviously. Now once you get in, let's go back to methodology, right? 'Cause I also wanna make sure that we're teaching people what mind space that they need to be in when they get past the door, right? So, I showed you the picture of doing your reconnaissance. You know, what the building looks like on the outside. It's very, very rare that you're gonna be able to find pictures of what the building looks like on the inside. Maybe you'll find it on social media. Maybe you'll find it on LinkedIn. Maybe you'll find it on some of these community spaces. Maybe you will. Maybe you won't. It is totally a mixed bag as to whether you'll find what the inside of the building looks like. And so you have to instinctively know in your head, you know, types of things that you're looking for when you get in there. So put yourself in the mindset. Again, remember pentesting is about thinking like a hacker, right? Thinking like a criminal. You walk in that door, you need to have it in your head that you're going to get caught. And so the first thing that you need to do is you need to find a place where you can set up shop that is gonna reduce your likelihood of getting caught. And I'll tell a story from, I'll go back to that pentest that I did in Boston. It was a military facility. This was while I was a civilian doing a pentest for military facility. You know, they did missile type of research at this facility. It was a research facility. They had man traps that I could see when I was doing my reconnaissance, when I was doing my onsite reconnaissance. They had man traps with the little spindles. I forget what they're called, right? The little twisty things like you got at amusement parks, right? That's an official technical term, a twisty thing. (David laughs) - I didn't know what was past that, right? But I knew that I needed to go somewhere. I knew that it was an eight story building so I knew there were elevators somewhere. And I knew that if I triggered an alarm at the beginning of the entrance, I needed to get to an elevator or to some stairs, and I needed to put some distance between me and the front desk. And so when I got to the other side of that turnstile. That's the word, turnstile. When I got to the other side of the turnstile, my immediate thought was where are the elevators? And it worked out for me because in this particular pentest, I noticed that there was a pressure plate on the turnstiles and what they were recording was as you swiped your badge, you stepped on the pressure plate and that's how they knew that one badge equals one person, turn the turnstile. Well, me, my method for getting into that building was I was going to fake swipe a badge, push the turnstile forward and step over the pressure plate. While I did that, it actually triggered an alarm, but there were enough people going through the turnstiles that I was able to rush to the elevator bank. And it was one of those. If you've ever been in a big building where the elevator is constantly open and closed. You don't have to push a button and wait for it. I was immediately able to walk into an elevator as the door was closing, get into the elevator and ride my way up to the eighth floor. But it's about having that mentality that says, all right, where do I go next once I'm inside? And you gotta be thinking about that move two or three steps ahead. So I got in the elevator, I headed upstairs, and this is where we talk about what do we do next? Now we have a lot at our disposal about what we can do next. First thing that I typically wanna do is I wanna look for a network port that I can plug into, right? I wanna go straight for the juggler, right? Physical access first. And so I'm looking for a network port that I can walk into. And so it may seem crazy, but I've mentioned this before. This is gonna floor your viewership so much. Make sure you've got a network adapter for your laptop. (Neal laughs) (David laughs) - This needs to be in your bag. Make sure that you have it network adapter for your laptop. Because I have indeed been on a pentest where I have gotten in and realized that I have no way to connect to the network. - [David] Ooh. (Neal laughs) - So surprise, (indistinct). So there's that one. So, jokes aside, jokes aside, you know, you know, getting access to the network is key and we wanna use our laptops. We wanna get access to that. But let's also say that we want to build in some redundancy, right? And this is where I think about some of the next tools that I've got at my disposal is where we build in some redundant connections. There is no greater joy in a pentest than to be able to go in, plant your hardware, leave the facility, and go conduct the pentest from your hotel room, right? That way you don't even have to interact with people. You don't have to interact with the customer, right? You just go do the pentest and you go back to your hotel room when you get there. Back to our Hak5 thing, I think Hak5 has created something ingenious with the LAN Turtle. I utterly love this thing, right? Because, you know, and likewise, we'll talk about the Rubber Ducky. I feel like it's been over-saturated, you know, from a content perspective, but I'll give it its nod. But this is also why I love LAN Turtle. Again, this doesn't come through as a removable storage. And so most computers, DLP systems, data loss prevention systems, that prevent you from plugging in a USB thumb drive recognize this as an HID or human interface device. And what this does is this actually installs itself as an HID, typically a keyboard or a mouse or something like this, that you plug into the back of the computer. And then you plug an ethernet port or the ethernet cable that was naturally into that desktop into the back of this thing. Now, what you can do with this, and this is actually completely capable just like the Rubber Ducky is, of having a (indistinct) reverse shell programmed into it. And so when you plug it in and it gets power and you've got an ethernet cable plugged into it, it will automatically call out to the C2 infrastructure, the command control infrastructure that you have set up in your pre-planning for the engagement, so that immediately you get access to a computer, you plug this in, you plug an ethernet cable in, and you should have a C2 shell hanging out, waiting for you on your infrastructure, ready for you to do your internal pentest in the form of an (indistinct) shell. - So would you rather plugged directly into network switch, like using a shock jack, or would you rather use the LAN Turtle and plug it in back of a computer? - A back of the computer is gonna be easier for you to find, right? If you think about most buildings, a switch is usually in a comm closet, and, you know, most comm closets are locked. You know, we've gotten really, really good about teaching, you know, building security that most comm closets are generally locked. I'm not gonna say all of them, but most of them are generally locked. It's real easy for you to bump into a conference room where you've got a computer that's running the conference room business, right? Whether it's projecting stuff, whether it's, you know, there for presentations, whether it's there for, you know, somebody to work in, whatever the case is. So you can bump into a conference room and have access to a computer right there, and so this is really easy for you to have access to a computer. Back pre-COVID, it's probably still the same in a post-COVID world now, but definitely pre-COVID, right? Where there were a lot of desktops in most corporate environments, nobody's gonna see this in the back of a computer, right? And so you can pop into a cubicle, pop into an office real quick, get down on all four, get down to your hands and knees, get underneath a desk, do some quick shimmying and on the back of a computer and nobody will ever see this at all. Versus like on the side of a laptop, this is pretty obvious on the side of a laptop. And so this has got a much, much higher success rate when you're talking physical access to a location, you know, 'cause it's easier to get access to a desktop. - What about why WiFi or wireless? Did you use LAN turtle or would you do like a WiFi connection using Pineapple or something like that? - So wireless is interesting, right? - And Neal, I don't wanna take you off your path if you've got another tool to show them. - No, no. No, no. This is why we make such a good team, David, is you pull on threads and I love threads. So wireless, I have a lot of things in my bag. Let me kind of walk through what I keep in my bag for wireless, and then I'll walk you through some use cases, okay? - I hope if you got like a real-world example you can show us, yeah. - I've got tons of real world examples. I got one you're gonna love. I got one you're gonna love. - Great. Great. - So let's start with the smallest, right? 'Cause cause form factor is everything, right? Super easy. Super easy wireless card. It's a TP link Whiskey November 722 November, right? Super easy. This plugs into your laptop. Super easy wireless card for you to plug into your laptop, right? So if you think about, you know, also something else that you could plug into a desktop computer to give instantaneous wireless access. This is something that you can plug into a desktop computer that you got on site and instantly turn a wired computer into a wireless computer, pretty easily. Something that you can use it in your laptop if you need to connect to wireless pretty easily. So I always recommend in my bag always keep one of these tiny little TP links, super, super resourceful. Now, from there, you can kind of expand upon it a little bit and get kind of crazy with what you do with wireless. One of the other things that I always keep in my bag is an Ubertooth, right? Not really easy to see but this is basically USB, plugs into a USB. You can see, I don't have any fancy cover for this Ubertooth. But the Uber tooth is used for intercepting Bluetooth transmissions. And so if you think about some IOT devices that you've got in some manufacturing sites. I've done a lot of IOT hacking through my career. So Bluetooth is huge for that. You know, early, early days of cell phones. I say that jokingly obviously, but Bluetooth was a fun thing to do. Intercepting Bluetooth keyboards. Some of the older Bluetooth keyboards, you can intercept as well and sniff keystrokes with a Ubertooth. So definitely on the wireless spectrum, I do keep an Uber tooth in the bag. I also keep one of these. Now this is a little bit on the overkill side, right? It's a HackRF One from Great Scott Gadgets. These things are awesome, but this is definitively like taking a bazooka to a knife fight, right? Type of thing. This thing is very overkill. I will keep one of these in my bag just... This is one of the few just-in-case items. And the only reason I keep this one in my bag as a just in case item is because it is tiny enough when you take this antenna off, you take this antenna off, when you look at that, it's pretty easy to fit that into a bag so it doesn't take up a whole lot of real estate. So this will be one that I kind of take with me as well. And plus, you know, you can use like some extended antennas. So like I'll use like an extended antenna like this to try to increase my range of something like this. So I've used this to listen in on radio communications with security guards, right? When you think about some of those cheap Motorola two-way radios that they use, you can use like the HackRF One to listen in to those security transmissions so that you know whether they're looking for you or not. And then of course we've got everybody's favorite, right? Which is the Hak5 Pineapple, right? Now, this is one of their latest models so it's much bigger than, you know, some of their earlier versions. But I definitely take one of these with me in the bag. And then on the smaller scale, right? If the HackRF One is the big version, there's a tiny version of the SDR. So both of these fall into the category of software defined radio, HackRF One being kind of like the bazooka, this being more like the scalpel, right? This one does receive only, whereas this one allows you to transmit, which don't do this at home because it is against the US Federal Communications Commission guidelines to transmit using a HackRF One. But with this one you can do receive only. So those are-- - Is it Bluetooth or is it like all kinds of frequency? - It's all kinds of frequency. So that's what I'm saying like when you look at something like this, this will get you across the spectrum, right? But it's very hard. Like from a practical execution standpoint, this is very hard to take on a pentest, right? There's no power in this model so you have to hook it up to your WiFi, right? Antennas are incredibly important to you, right? And so you have to carry lots of various types of antennas with you. And then, like I said, it's very, very overkill for what is trying to do. When we talk about needing power to run this, this is where we can get kind of freaked. So this, same device, exact same device. But these guys called are Shared Brain Technology. Shared Brain Technology have created basically an LCD screen that kind of goes over top of this. And you can plug in a battery pack down here on the back and it'll allow you to do the whole thing basically manually by hand with this key pad that's down here on the bottom. So it makes it a little bit more usable when it comes to on-site pentests, but that's why I very much equate this to like the bazooka versus being very, very targeted with things like this, things like this. And then last but not least call me a dinosaur, I don't really care, but I will still never go anywhere without a tried and true Alpha in my bag. At the end of the day, the Alpha is still-- - That one's discontinued. But I mean, they're the same kind of models that can do something similar. Alphas are great - Alphas are great, yeah. I mean, yeah, this... Again, call me a dinosaur, but Alphas are fantastic and I still don't go anywhere without an Alpha. - Okay. So that's tools and on. The problem I see a lot in the hacking community, Neal, is people say, \"Get all these tools.\" And then like, the next question is, \"Okay, what do I do with them?\" So can you give us a practical example, I think you said you were going to, of like where you use some of this stuff? - Absolutely. And in this example, we're gonna primarily be talking about the WiFi Pineapple. The WiFi Pineapple is interesting, right? And let's call a spade a spade when it comes to wireless hacking, right? Wireless hacking isn't what it used to be, right? There aren't 9 million companies out there running around with WEP anymore, right? It's, you know, wireless hacking was the thing that everybody wanted to do back when it was easy, but it's not easy now, right? Organizations have gotten better. Technology has gotten better. Heck, even your home routers have gotten better when it comes to, you know, randomizing, you know, long string passwords for your PSK on your home router, right? - I will still say users use dumb passwords. - Users do use dumb passwords. - But I agree with you. It's much harder now. - It's much, much harder now. And so like this old tried true methodology where you're like, \"Oh, I'm just gonna come in with an Alpha. \"I'll set up WiFi or something like that \"or Aircrack-ng or anything like that \"and I'm just gonna sniff.\" Especially corporate wireless passwords. - Yeah, corporate. - Good luck. You're wasting your time. Like, here's... And this was... When I made this switch, this was 2016 when I made this switch, I actually stopped charging clients separately for wireless pentest. I stopped charging clients separately because it's you realize that a wireless pentest, and this is why this is probably more of a conversation we'd have on my stream, David, when we talk about real conversations with real people, right? But I've seen people charge 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, $50,000 for a wireless pentest where they literally spend 15 to 20 minutes unpacking all of their gear only to find out that it's completely hardened up from a wireless perspective, right? And corporations would pay that because we've set a standard in the pentesting industry that \"a wireless pentest is its own separate pentest\" and it requires \"so much work\". And that's just, we have bamboozled companies with that. Sorry, small tangent, small tangent. (laughs) - No, I think it's... Neal, what I love about talking to you is you making it real because, you know, we gotta make it real because if someone wants to do this, they want the base knowledge and the best equipment. So I appreciate you, you know, saying exactly how you feel. - Yeah. - There are very few people that can say they've done 5,000 plus pentests. So, you know, let's help the next generation take all your experience and knowledge and, you know, from day one know what to do. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So getting back to getting back to what you said earlier about how important is social engineering, right? I started reframing all of my wireless pentests just to be an extension of social engineering, right? And so when you think about wireless in organizations, let's pick on a hospital, just because I think hospitals are easy targets, especially on the wireless side, right? You can use a Pineapple for social engineering, through karma attacks. We can do a whole section on karma attacks, but basically this rogue access point, your cell phones, your laptops, right? Every time you connect to one of those free WiFi things at the airport is source that SSIID, and it will constantly beacon out and look for that SSIID ad infinitum. If you never remove that SSI ID from your phone or from your laptop, it'll look for that SSIID ad infinitum. And so you can use something like a WiFi Pineapple doing a karma attack, and what'll happen is it'll literally sit inside of an organization and it will basically be listening for all of those devices that are like, \"Hey, I'm looking for AT&T wireless. \"Are you AT&T wireless?\" And it will respond and be like, \"Yes, I am AT&T wireless.\" And then you can set up a captive portal on the WiFi Pineapple to make it look like, and again, if we were to pick on a hospital, make it look like the hospital's, \"Hey, if you wanna access our free WiFi, \"you need to log into this captive portal \"with your Google email address, \"or your Hotmail email address, \"or your Outlook email address,\" whatever the case is, and we will get you access to that. And so that's where, you know, I'll usually take like a hotspot like this, right? So it's like a mobile hotspot. It connects to WiFi. (indistinct) connects to cellular and provides you with a WiFi signal. I'll double side sticky-tape that to like the top of my WiFi Pineapple like that and I'll stick this inside of an organization with a karma attack and I'll harvest usernames and passwords all day long. Now, listen, when you think about that, you have to ask yourself, is that a wireless attack or is that a social engineering attack? Because it matters when you go to write up your report. It is a wireless attack because if you've got like a Meraki or something like that that should be detecting rogue access points, this is effectively acting like a rogue access point in your organization and you should have some type of identification and detection mechanism in your corporate wireless environment to detect rogue access points to use these types of attacks. And so it's still a wireless attack, but you're using social engineering to facilitate the attack. And so that's how you have to start changing that methodology in your head is you're still attacking the wireless, it's still on the corporate side, a wireless mitigation technique, but you're using social engineering to target the wireless systems and break into the wireless systems. Now I've got another example for you as well, David. This one, I've actually got visual yummies to kind of show you as well. - Good. I like that. - So this one actually did happen in a hospital, that's why I use this one as an example. You can obviously tell that this is an older model of a WiFi Pineapple that I had. But I had done my pretext. I had done my recon on the hospital. I'd walked into the hospital and I had found that they had an entire wing of this hospital that was under construction. I had found an abandoned office, and this is me taking a picture showing that I had found the abandoned office. This was my (indistinct) here. You can see that in here, they had wireless jacks. So obviously one of the first things that I talk about, right, when I talk about getting access to a location is to check those fiscal jacks, to see those fiscal jacks have port security enabled on them. 99.9% of the companies don't have port security enabled on the switches because it's an administrative nightmare, you know, to enable port security and have to disable it every time somebody wants to move a computer around. So I found a jack like this inside of this office and I set up my WiFi Pineapple inside of that office and set it next to a window. And I just set it up in there basically as a WiFi repeater. And what I then did... In this little red circle up here, this was the parking garage. This was the parking garage. And so I drove my rental car up there to the top of that parking garage, David, and I connected to my WiFi access point. (indistinct) the Pineapple as a WiFi access point. And you can kind of see that this that I've got highlighted down here was my access point that I had set up in here. I was able to connect to it and have access to the corporate network using a WiFi Pineapple right from the parking garage. - But the thing that strikes me always with what you're saying, Neal, is it's always social engineering. You had to get your way into that building somehow. - Yeah. - And then you were able to plant something in the building that gave you remote access. Whether it's a remote shell from a LAN Turtle, whether it's a WiFi Pineapple that you piggybacking off, or whether you doing something, it's always, you get into the building somehow. - That is correct. - And you make sure that people don't try and put you in jail. (Neal laughs) - I got stories for that too. I got stories for that too. But it is. Listen on the pyramid of pain, at the very tippy top, physical access is king. If you gain physical access to your target, if you gain... This is why when we talk about hotel made attacks, right, on diplomat computers, you know, who are overseas, right? Once you have that physical laptop in hand, then you can do some of those, you know, cold boot attacks and things like that on computers to try to defeat, you know, physical disc encryption and password lockouts and things like that. Because physical access is king. Physical pentests, right? The hardest part of any \"on-site pentest\", where, you know, you have to social engineer your way in is the social engineering or your way in. There are so many tools that you have at your disposal once you get inside the door and they're all 100% effective in most cases that I've seen. But social engineering your way in is still the key. And listen, let's be real, when you read the Verizon data breach report, when you read Stuxnet, right? When you read about how Stuxnet got into the nuclear... Yeah, the (indistinct) reactors, right? When you read how that stuff happens, it all sources from social engineering. It happens. And so it is the vector. It's why ransomware is so successful today is because they can get somebody to click on an email. Listen, you know, they arrested somebody. They arrested somebody who was working at the Tesla factory in Nevada because they found some hackers who were trying to bribe somebody into taking a USB into the Tesla factory to install ransomware on Tesla. - [David] Yeah. Yeah. - It's not sophisticated. Like I love the fact that we use that \"I'm an ex NSA hacker\" on all of our promotions, but when you look at anything... I can tell you definitively, I tell you definitively. A lot of the hacks that we used were either because we had HUMINT from the CIA give us passwords, we intercepted passwords, we cracked weak passwords, or we had HUMINT from the CIA install a thumb drive for us. Like we had, when I was there, we had 12 zero-days. And they were like in 19 levels of locked vaults and special access programs and things like that... Think the worst of the worst, that was when you pulled out a zero-day at your disposal. But that is the same thing that cyber criminals use on us on a day-to-day basis. It's the same thing that state sponsored actors use us on a day-to-day basis. I think we've seen more zero-days used in the last 24 months, and I would probably attribute that to COVID because there hasn't been as much opportunity for HUMINT, you know, as much as there would be, but we see more zero-days used in the last 24 months than I think I ever saw my entire time working in the military. - Neal, I just wanna get there term. HUMINT? Human interaction, yeah? - Human intelligence. Human intelligence. Yeah, human intelligence. If I... Real-world example, not from the military. I did a pentest for a collections company. In the US, for those who need some history, right? In the US we have these companies that literally make money if your American Express or Visa or MasterCard, or something like that, and you're behind on paying your credit card bill, will turn over that to a collections agency and then that collections agency will call you and pester you until the day that you die to get that money from you. I did a pentest on one of those organizations one time and we wanted to test how susceptible the employees were to bribery, social engineering, human intelligence. And so I did that. I gave... Went out to the smoke pit. See, the trend here, when it comes to smoke pits. - Yeah, I was gonna say, there is a recurring theme here. Don't smoke. Ban smoking. - Go out to the smoke pit, right? And I literally, I took $100 of petty cash out from the company. We knew we were gonna do this, right? I took $100 out and I literally put $100 in one hand and a USB in another hand. And I went out to the smoke pit and I found one person who was out there by themselves, not in a crowd of people so there was no social stigma or anything like that. And I said, \"How'd you like $100?\" And of course, they looked at me funny. They were like, \"Well, boy, what's in it for me?\" And I said, \"If you take this thumb drive in, \"plug it into your computer, I'll give you $100.\" I gave him the $100, gave him the thumb drive. They went in, they plugged in the thumb drive, gave me access to their network for $100. - In their own computer? - In their own computer. - Mad. - Right? - For 100 bucks. - For 100 bucks. It will happen. It will happen. And you see it now. Ransomware operators today are offering people percentage of share of the ransomware that they get from a company to install their ransomware. Social engineering is key. It happens. It is the way that people are getting into networks. And so yes, back to your original point, I'll show you another one. I did this exact same approach. This was a little bit more brazen. I took my laptop into the hospital that I was testing at the time and I sat down at a computer that I saw was empty and pretended to be help desk working on a computer. At one point in time, I used the used the tool to disrupt network traffic on that local switch that I was at, which I knew was gonna disrupt the traffic of the people around me. And at one point in time, I came out and said, \"Hey, excuse me. \"Are you having trouble gaining access \"to the network for any reason?\" And this individual was like, \"Yes, yes. \"As a matter of fact, I am.\" I said, \"Huh? \"Yeah, I'm seeing some weird behavior \"coming from your computer. \"I need to check some stuff on the server. \"Can I get you to write down your password for me \"so that I can verify it with the central server \"and I'll let you know \"if there's something I can do to fix it.\" And I kid you not, this individual, as you can see this screenshot, literally took a Post-it Note, wrote their ID down and wrote their password down on a Post-it Note and handed it to me. (David laughs) - I was already in the building. I had a laptop. I sat down at a computer and I started working. The levels of trust that I had just by physically being there meant that I was authorized to ask him or her for that information. - [David] Well. - Furthermore, we can continue to go on through this report. This was another case. You can see on the backside of this wall, there was a conference room. And you can kind of see on the right-hand side here, I had physical access to this. You can see here, I had my Alpha out at the time, was doing some wireless testing in this particular location. And I proceeded to social engineer my way into this office and then I noticed that this conference room wasn't being used. And so I took my trusty Pineapple, put my trusty Pineapple up into the window, plugged it into the LAN jack, went right back out there to the parking lot and proceeded to hack the entire organization from the parking lot, with my trustee Pineapple. And in every single one of these engagements, every single of these engagements, employees were encouraged, encouraged that if they saw anything suspicious, they should report it to the IT help desk. And at no point in time, when you look at a picture of that Pineapple and you see how big and brazen it was with a big, huge sticker on it, at no point in time did employees report it to the help desk. It gets better, David. I mean, look, if you wanna get me on a soap box. - [David] I love your soap boxes. Go for it. - I sat... This was Neal years ago, many, many pounds heavier. This is Neal sitting in the cafe of a hospital and I wished that I had gotten the person to take the picture, but obviously it was hard to convince somebody to take the picture of all of my suspicious activities. But I did want to have somebody take my picture in the cafe. And so I asked a random stranger to take my picture in the cafe so that I could show my mom, of me sitting in the cafe. But over here on the right hand side, you can kind of see I've got all my hacking gear, all my WiFi hacking stuff, plugged into the side of my laptop. There is a WiFi Pineapple that is plugged into an ethernet jack over here behind the port. There is a security guard directly behind me and I'm sitting here with \"HACKER\" on my laptop. (David laughs) - And nobody-- - You're hacking for charity, so you're okay. - But I'm okay, right? Nobody, at no point in time, not this security guard behind me or any other patron of this cafe is watching me in this hospital, and you can see from these pictures, this is a pretty busy hospital, says anything to me, not even ask me what I'm doing. People naturally assume that once you're inside the building, you are trusted. This is where we get into that security concept, where once you're on the inside, you're trusted. That's why all these tools are fantastic. All these tools are great, right? We could talk about all these tools all day long. They're all awesome, right? And they all do great things. That's because they're all trusted once you're on the inside, once you're physically on the inside. And this is why like, circling this all the way back around, David, why we don't carry a rucksack with 50 pounds of gear on an onsite pentest, is because the organization trust this device. And so why do I need 50 pounds of gear when I can do most of my work with just a handful of devices? - Are they any other devices that you've got that you think are really good? Or have you covered what you would take with you? - I've covered the devices that I think are key. Obviously you should carry spares of things like, again, this is another Hak5 device. It's a little mini switch right here that allows you to have access to that. You know, again, I always encourage folks to take extras, right, of cables and antennas. I carry, you know, you can see I've got an unopened Rubber Ducky here, right? Because I always carry an extra just in case one breaks on you, right? There are things like that that I always encourage folks to carry. But in terms of core critical equipment, something for wireless. In my case, it's a Hak5 Pineapple. Take something like a hotspot that you can use for, you know, getting access to the outside world. Pretty much everything that is Hak5 related. So LAN Turtle, Rubber Ducky. We also have the Bash Bunny here. - [David] Bash Bunny? - Yeah, the Bash Bunny. We've got the Packet Squirrel here as well. Listen, the Packet Squirrel like, you know, when we talk about the value of packets, right? And I'll pick on hospitals again. Hospitals are very, very notorious for this, right? Packet squirrel is incredibly helpful. So hospitals typically have a centralized EMR, electronic medical records. I couldn't think of... EMR, electronic medical records system. The most common one that's here in the US is called Epic. An MRI machine that takes your MRI data has to send it to the EMR system, in this case, Epic. Believe it or not, that transmission is 100% un-encrypted. They send your PII un-encrypted across the wire because there's no standardization between somebody who's MRI machine and the Epic system. And so that protocol is vastly un-encrypted when it sends those medical records. And so I've definitively used tools like the Bash Bunny. I've used, just packed intercepts on like a (indistinct) shell to basically intercept raw packets and pull PII directly off the wire in a hospital through the Bash Bunny. So Bash Bunny is huge for things like that. Ubertooth for Bluetooth. Where's my Proxmark? I set my Proxmark down. I can't find my Proxmark now. There it is. A Proxmark. Right? Those would be the tools that I think are critically important that you have in your bag and they're your Swiss army knife. They will help you through 95% of the scenarios that you will ever encounter in most modern pentests. - Okay, Neal. I come from a networking background so I'm gonna push you on the networking side. Yeah? - Go for it. - A lot of people when I create videos say, \"The networking stuff is not important.\" They wanna do like weird other stuff. But every example you've given me is like a networking example. You're trying to connect to a network and then get remote access to the network. So it sounds to me that networking is extremely important. Is that right? - Networking is incredibly important. And listen. So I know we talk about my cyber side pretty extensively but when I joined the Air Force in 2003, one of the first certs that I got in the Air Force was CCNA back in 2003. And so when I came out of CCNA, I was like, \"Networks are awesome and they're impenetrable \"and everybody designs networks \"exactly like they're supposed to, \"the way they teach you in CCNA. \"Everybody, everywhere, every network.\" - Of course. No one uses dynamic trunking protocol or anything like that. (Neal laughs) - Oh, VLAN? VLAN? Listen, hold on real quick. This is gonna hurt some of your networking students right here. Hold on. VLANs are the coolest thing in the world. VLANs are the coolest thing in the world. You know what most network administrators in most corporate environments use networking for? To extend their switch. (David laughs) (Neal laughs) - They use VLANs that way they don't have to buy 50 more switches. (laughs) - [David] Yep. - They don't do proper VLAN routing. They don't add ACLs in between their VLANs. They don't do any type of VLAN isolation. It's like port security, right? I could tell you that of every pentest I've ever done, I'm trying to think if I can get this number close to accurate, I could probably count to you on two hands how many companies I've actually ever done an onsite physical pentest for that have implemented some level of port security that has stopped me. And when I say port security, I'm talking like switch port, you know, disable, enable port security. I'm not talking about NAC, right? NAC is not port security. NAC is because your network administrators are too lazy to do port security. I'll totally make some people mad about that. I'm very cynical on NAC, right? And so, yeah, I could probably count on two hands how many companies I've actually ever seen do true port level port security out there. Because it's too complicated. Because it's an administrative nightmare, just like VLANing, just like doing inter-VLAN routing, and just like doing ACLs on VLANs. And so even something like, listen, I've seen people, not Cain and Abel. Listen, Cain and Abel to date is still the only tool that does true remote desktop protocol man in the middle. How are you gonna bash something that you can sit on a switch with network administrators and truly intercept their RDP traffic? Because you know that they don't have an internal CA. You know that they're gonna accept that self-signed certificate and you're gonna be able to intercept those already RDP credentials right there off the bat, with a tool that runs in windows, that's well over 15 years old. - I mean, Neal, I love talking to you because after 5,000 pentests, you still make the point that what people should do and what they actually do, are vastly different. - Vastly. Vastly. And listen, as long as that happens... Dude go learn zero-days. I've taken multiple exploit development classes. I've written one true zero-day in the civilian side in my entire career, right? I have never, ever actually done zero-days for pentests other than the one, one time that I did it. And I've read the exploit. I've done exploit development. I've written exploits before, and it's all cool. It truly is a crap ton of fun. Bleep that one out, right? (David laughs) - It really is fun to do that stuff. But so long as there are people on a network and they are doing stupid stuff by taking your Bash Bunny or taking your Rubber Ducky and plugging it into a network for a 100 bucks from the smoke pit, your time is better spent focusing on where the weaknesses are. - Yeah. I love it. Neal, I really wanna thank you for sharing, you know, not just techie stuff, but like real-world stuff and your wisdom. Because after so many paintings and so much experience, you know, people I think get enamored by the shiny objects. The shiny objects grab the attention and they forget that's not where it's at. - My biggest advice to people, and this is why I started to take the stance that I've taken when it comes to pentesting and red team operations, right? What's your learning out there in the world right now, from Udemy, from YouTube, whatever the case is, it's all great and it is all fun and it's all very foundational knowledge. Be careful that you're not confusing knowledge with wisdom, right? You're getting tons of knowledge by what you're learning out there. David and I are gonna bring you wisdom about how this stuff gets used, what reality is, and what's really happening out there in the real world, because you're not writing zero-days for pentest on a regular basis. And I know that that's what most of you think that it is that you're gonna be doing as a pentester. I know most of you think that you're just gonna be churning away at pop and shells on 500 million boxes. Small high horse on this, right? If any of you wanna know what real pentesting looks like, go sign up for any of the bug bounty programs, start smashing your head against some web app pentests, not being able to... You know, most of you will go, you'll learn that, you know, SQL injection, 1=1, or cross-site scripting alert boxes, and then go out there and do like a pentest with one of these bug bounty platforms and realize that none of that stuff works, right? That's because that stuff works great when your test environment is damn vulnerable web app, or, you know, something like that, and it's designed to teach you how easy 1=1 is from a SQL injection perspective. But finding a company where you can do 1=1 and get into their credit card database, so small. It's just not reality. - Yeah. So what would you recommend people spend their time doing, Neal? So like if you take all your knowledge and all your wisdom and experience? Should they invest in buying the Hak5 tools? What would you, you know, someone wanted to do pentesting as a career, what would you recommend they start? Is it like, watch our previous video? Do Hack The Box? Stuff like that? You know, what's your starting point. - So I think mentality is everything, right? And I've said this before, right? I think, you know, you and I, David, are huge fans of being honest with yourself when you go into this process, when you go into this mission, right? And so I'm not trying to discourage you from going to Udemy, or I'm not trying to discourage you from going to YouTube. I'm not trying to discourage you from, you know, one course or another or anything else like that, right? That's not the goal. The goal is to be honest with yourself, right? And realize that on the pyramid of things that you need to learn, you're definitely down here on the foundational knowledge, right? You're getting a ton of knowledge and I want you to get a ton of knowledge. I think there's a lot valuable knowledge we've covered in numerous videos, David, where I think you can get some of the best knowledge that is out there, right? And so I'd encourage everybody to look at your videos, come to my streams. You know, there's lots of great knowledge that's out there. There are things that, and you know, again, let's call a spade, a spade, right? You know, when you're done with knowledge and you're looking for wisdom, when you're looking for practical, you know, experiences, there's no substitute for tenure, right? David, you've been in this business for 30 years? - Way too long. - Way too long. (laughs) Right? I've been in this business for over 20 years, right? Right? There are some people out there who are teaching on Udemy, and this isn't a bash against Udemy and I think some of those instructors are fantastic from a knowledge perspective, but they're barely in the pentesting space. They've been doing it for a year. They've been doing it for two years. They've been doing it for three years, right? Now, they may have some good experience after one year or two year or three years but take that into consideration when you're receiving knowledge from them and understand that what knowledge you may be getting may not necessarily be indicative of the real world stuff. And that's what I would encourage you to look at is weigh the knowledge against their bona fides and say, \"Okay, how does this actually work in the real world?\" - So, Neal, the biggest problem is there's not a lot of that up there. So I'm gonna expect you to create some courses or something. - You know, you can give your audience a teaser, you know, but I think there's some cool things that you and I are gonna do that's coming. - That's right. I mean, the problem is there are not that many Neal Bridges around, and there's not that many people that are willing to share what they know. So, yeah, Neal, no pressure, but you better get cracking because we need you to share that wisdom. - Every week, David, you and I. Every week. Let's share some wisdom. Let's share some wisdom. - Great, Neal, we better wrap it up. Thanks so much. - Not a problem. (upbeat music)",

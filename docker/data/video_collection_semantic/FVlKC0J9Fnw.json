    "transcript": "hello good people I'm Dmitry and recently I did a silent system and the Silent base 801 enjoyable experience I had six fans in there the total DBA at load was under 35 which was amazing but today we're gonna try to do something different and so in that system I used all be quiet components to silent loop 360 with silent wings 3 fans and silent wings 3 fans for the cases well overall very happy with temperatures and noise levels and the pump here is practically inaudible but people recommending hey if you want to go with silence why not try Noctua and since I have this nice collection of coolers over here including the nhd 15 which is this massive Tower lots of cooling capacity for the 9900K and the new NF 812 fans that I'll be replacing inside the case so I'm really exited to see how quiet we can get the system to run all on air cooling gotta get those accessories well looks like all the components are here let's start the build right after this so you're saying this is the most colorful way to cool I'm telling you the master liquid ml 360 our RGB is the way to go cooler masters new three sixty millimeter all-in-one liquid cooler is all about performance in style with a custom low resistance radiator and dual chamber pump wood sleeve tubing for that premium look while being totally flexible the fan strike your balance for air pressure and airflow with transparent blades to perfectly match the colorful combination of the pump then you can sync via its own controller or through various addressable and 12-volt RGB connectors alright perhaps you should check it out in the scription below alright so the interesting thing about these two enclosures is the silent base 601 and 801 are basically an identical frame like I could literally just swap out this glass panel for here and it would fit perfectly fine but the 801 is slightly larger at the bottom because of the included case feet so you can take them off and I actually forgot about this in my review you can pick it up by the bottom versus the keys feed on the 601 are kind of built into the frame we still have the push button to release the side panel I love this approach it's to us and like I said I could simply put this panel on the 801 and it would fit and the other difference would be as the price so the 601 is $30 cheaper so this guy sells for $130 versus $160 for the window version of the 801 now the internal is very similar both support eATX motherboards the 601 as you can see slightly smaller because the 801allows you to invert the motherboard tray so there's a bit more height clearance over here we also have an additional intake fan on the 801 versus having only a single one for the 601 and a single exhaust the power supply shroud is also different so this one is fully metal with only the front modular pieces that you can move here through mount a fan or here to insert that your radiator verses on the 801 so we have four modular pieces the front and this plastic piece so it is slightly different and I do prefer like the fully built-in power supply shroud on the 601 things of the back also look pretty similar but the 801 has a fan control for six fans whereas the 601 does not and finally the i/o is pretty much identical with two USB 3 power reset buttons audio jacks a single USB port and a little fan control over here but it is controlling the included fans and you cannot add to it it is powered by SATA and we have no pwm fan control and as for noise reduction we have this really thick 10 millimeter noise absorbing foam on the rear panel and on the front panel everything is dust proof protected so a nice giant dust filter for your front fans and removing the bottom dust filter from the front nice and convenient there's also the noise absorbing material for the top that is kept clear of your ventilation space at the back as for a fan and radiator mounts you can do a 360 or 280 up top and the same thing goes for the front so pretty good water cooling and airflow options alright so now that we are familiar what this case is all about the 601 is basically an 801 with a slightly shorter power supply shroud and less height above the motherboard for all your radiator stuff I think it's time to do our side all right so I think that would be a first for me you know having that classical relaxing music for a building montage computer but that represents my mood perfectly with the silent bass 601 say what you will about the brown Noctua offense but once they're all together in the system and it's not just like one cooler it's all the fans in the system it makes total sense and they kind of like bring it all together I didn't have to replace the front fan on the CPU cooler because the RAM modules are slightly too high for it and yeah you got five fans in there let's make sure that this thing is running silent as for cable management as you can see everything is perfectly clean I'm not running multiple drive so I just stashed away my SSD right in here I secured my 24 pin and the PCI cables right behind here also connected the eight pin so yeah everything is clean the side panel closes without any force and we've plenty of space over there for more going to need to close the mister window because of that lovely construction noise outdoors I'm probably gonna have to wait for after they're finished to do my DBA measurements but for now let's actually go ahead and set this thing up and configure all the fan profiles so they're just whisper quiet but also give me the enough cooling because of that hot hot hot 9900K a few moments later oh all right so after some tweaking I'm happy with everything that I've configured here all my fans are running about 1200 rpm and they're incredibly quiet I'm impressed Noctua well done except for the middle large fan that's running around a thousand rpm because that one gets slightly louder if you push the rpm higher now my target DBA for anything silent for my own sort of preference would be under 35 DBA at load and so this system right now is running about 34 DBA at load this is with the GPU at 44 percent and the CPU running at 4.7 gigahertz so very happy with the result it is slightly just a tiny bit louder than my silent base 801 system and I think that is because all the noise in this system is coming from back so all that exhaust air and if I reduce the RPM of the rear fan the system is basically completely silent but then we kind of lose on cooling because that is the only way to exhaust air versus on my silent base 801 machine I had three fans exhausting hair and I think the noise was there a little bit more distributed versus here where it's all kind of concentrated in that rear section as for temperatures the CPU ran at 80 degrees Celsius this is the 9900K at 4.7 gigahertz so it's bit hot I could tweak around with the voltages to reduce that temperature there the GPU was running at 76 degrees Celsius without 44% fan speed so the system is practically inaudible but it is slightly hot inside of course I can increase the speed of the front fans and that definitely pushes a lot of that air out it helps with intake as well but interestingly when I removed that front panel so when I remove this front panel you can hear a lot more noise is being escaped from the front but we dropped our CPU temperature by 10 degrees so it looks like there's always that balance of trying to make a machine silent while also perform good with airflow and you know 10 degree drop with a simple panel removal yeah I guess that is our direction when it comes to silent cases now for all of you who are saying hey that brown color scheme on the fans is absolutely ugly and I was one of those people as well but Noctua makes black fans and when they're all together they can't make sense and they look pretty good but if you're brave enough to maneuver yourself into the RGB direction definitely check out color orange that I think complements the brown very well I'm not going overly crazy but here's an example with the Lian Li streamer cable something that is becoming a lot more popular with those individually colored 24 and 8 pin cables so that's something to keep in mind alright so that concludes my second adventure into the silent territory I'm happy with the silent base 601 of course cooling is a big compromise especially when you remove that front panel not even the best filter leave the dust filter in but that front panel is a major hindrance for air flow so you got to balance out certain things when it comes to making sure that your system stays silent all right guys I'm Dmitry hope you enjoy this content there's more right over here our new boot sequence channel is over here to snow is here the main and we'll see you in next video I guess I will conclude like last time as always stay quiet my friends",

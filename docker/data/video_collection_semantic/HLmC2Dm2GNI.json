    "transcript": "Ready, Aim, fire. So the other day I get a call. Tom gives me a call. He says, listen I'm out, I'm at the store and I see something you need to know about, not just you Lew, but the audience. The world needs to know, that this thing exists. And I'm like, Tom, what could it possibly be? He responds. The Scuderia Ferrari Black Fragrance Spray hard case for iPhone. It's shocking. I know. I told the man to buy it, so I could bring it to you. There are big announcements that happen in the tech and gadget world. And then there's other things that fly under the radar. It's not a new phone, it's not a new laptop, it's not a drone it is an (coughs) an unbelievable achievement. This case that goes on your iPhone gives you access to cologne when ever you might need it. What kind of what kind of person has gotta have Listen, I'm not here to judge, but if you're the kind of a person that needs that potential I've never I mean I've looked all the weird cases that exist on the planet. This might be Jack, is this the weirdest probably the weirdest. I've looked at cases that have weapons in them, tools, case with headphones built into it, case you could light a cigarette with, or anything else for that matter This is the WEIRDEST! Not only that but its Ferrari too! (laughs) So, somehow this thing goes on your phone and sprays cologne, and it's refillable, and it's Ferrari, and that's what happening here, and you can thank Tom for this video. \"An official Ferrari licensed product\" Look at that, it's got the badge on it. Now it is refillable, also, 'cause I know that's another question that you had. You were like, \"But Lew, what happens \"when I'm all out of my fragrance? \"People around me, they start to expect that fragrance. \"How do i get it back in my case?\" I can smell it already. Oh my goodness! (laughs) (sniffs) That's kind of heavy, too, and fat. So this entire place smells like this right now. I can hardly breathe. It's not a bad smell. I guess you gotta take it easy, though. See, my problem is I assume if you've got a case with cologne in it chances are you- you- you're a little abundant with the application. So you press [click] Oh! Wait a sec, is there some already in here? Look at that! \"Made in Italy\" You didn't expect to see that, Jack. Ahh! So they give you two. You've got two different little packs, 25 millilitres each The phone will clip on. I've got an iPhone 6 here. This one is for 6 or 6S. Just (clicks) I mean I just I don't really get it! Do you need the cologne on you at all times? I mean, this is bigger than, like, a Mophie battery case. You're like you're always loaded up with cologne? Like, how what level do you need to keep it at? I feel like I'm getting nauseous right now. I'm gonna you're gonna smell this, brother. There you go. This whole place is gonna smell like Ferrari cologne now We'll never get rid of it! and like I don't think it smells bad, but like isn't this the kind of thing you spray in the morning? I gotta be honest, I don't wear cologne, so I'm obviously not the target market. It smells like uh It smells like waiting in line to get into a club. A couple of shots, \"Ayy, ayy!\" Look it how recessed the camera is. I find it hard to believe that's even gonna work correctly. Let me check. Works just fine. Let's try the light, though. Alright, it functions still. The phone still functions it feels really bizarre holding it. It is the fattest case I've ever put on a iPhone and for the weirdest reason 3... 2... 1... (Sprays) Boom! It does fire pretty far, though, I do have to say. This thing is inside of stores right now. Humans are buying it and you have a responsibilityas a humanto be aware. The dangers that are out there. Lemme give you a little shot on your way out Here you go, this is for you. I apologize. This is as close as you'll ever get to smelling it. I don't actually want to spray it on the lens. I'll never get it off!",

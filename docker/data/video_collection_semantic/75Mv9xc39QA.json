    "transcript": "I bought 64 cores of CPU power from eBay for just over six dollars a core surely this is gonna go fine right [Music] now I think these are the CPUs and then I think these may be the coolers and this is the motherboard that'll house all of the madness so let's open this up first [Music] oh yes shenzen [Music] oh we get a rear IO Shield of not the worst quality at least it's got the like squidgy stuff on the back and some sort of cables very nice thank you [Music] finally getting there oh wow oh no way we've got like a Ziploc anti-static bag I don't think I've ever seen that before look at that oh look at that monster now the first thing that punches you in the face when you see this motherboard are the two gargantuan sp3 sockets which house AMD epic CPUs they are complex inducingly massive sockets look at them next you'll notice that each socket has eight Ram slots giving us a total of 16. oh there's some useful information down here always populated Doom X1 first so I'm assuming that's this one and this one oh there's a whole bunch of jumpers down here which I'm guessing of like various bios and startup settings and is that that looks like a Micro SD card slot that's fascinating oh what are these connectors I've never seen those before CPU one SATA zero to three oh that's cool when it comes to rear IO we've got Mesozoic period port and a whole bunch of ethernet they've really they've really gone all in on ethernet here with that let's see what epic CPUs we got to fill them sockets oh never mind this is a different box oh the coolers are also in here I see [Music] wow that's quite a beefy looking cooler we've got five heat pipes a decent bit of fin stack and a powerful looking fan but the most important part is that this cooler actually has enough girth to satisfy an epic CPU something that not many consumer coolers can say so yeah I got two of these [Music] finally we have our massive CPU I'm really excited to see this thing let's kind of do that oh I wonder if this was Factory packaging or not it really looks like it's not but it's not a consumer grade product so I guess you never know oh it's also got a little Ziploc anti-static bag I really like that oh a tour and that's our CPU so this is a ryzen epic 7551 a 32 core 64 thread monster from 2016 which at launched cost almost three thousand dollars and I bought two of them for 400 off of eBay so they're like definitely gonna work right foreign so now comes the fascinating part where we see what it's like mounting the CPU in here we've got these three bolts that we need to undo I wonder if the iFixit kit will have that bit this actually kind of looks like it no way that's it okay so this is number one that we undo oh they just screwed one of them down okay very good oh covers the socket now as far as I understand it we just kind of oh no no wait there's this bracket ah there we go okay slide through like that and then and in this one and then I think we just [Music] cool and then just like that we have a mounted epic CPU so we've just got one more to go and then we have huge amounts of power foreign [Music] and then when it comes to the CPU Cooler I guess it just kind of goes on like that right obviously you need to do thermal paste I think I'm going to do like a cross and then some dots so we'll see if it catches on fire it clearly isn't enough and then we just pop this bad boy on [Music] next I just kind of want to see if it works so I'm gonna drop a single stick of ram per CPU in hook this up to a power supply and pray to Thor that it turns on and men will worry about populating all of the ram channels I I don't know where I'm gonna find another RAM for this thing now for the first boot I'm gonna try some of this jadak Rams that Patriot sent over just to see if it works with like non-ecc memory I can't see why it wouldn't but you never know with this kind of stuff [Music] and after very not precariously removing the m.2 standoff so I could Mount some storage in this bad boy and dropping in a CMOS battery I was ready to test fire this monster go so now I just need a graphics card to drop in here I think I'm going to keep it in the family you know uh so I'm going to use an AMD GPU oh oh what because of how long the graphics card is it hits these and then won't suck it that's stupid hopefully it works in this bottom one let's give it a try ah yes that fits very good oh it looks promising things are lighting up in places I just need to figure out how to oh I think this is the front I oh that's under the graphics card very good after spending quite some time trying to jump start this Abomination it became clear it wasn't jump starting yeah I don't know this doesn't seem to be working oh it's not responding to power at all even with no Ram in it I don't know if server Hardware is different or not but that's not a good sign but with a bit of research I identified a potential solution ah okay so big problem uh I didn't do enough research going into this video which is quite normal that's usually the case except this is server stuff so the the problems are much bigger than they are with consumer grain Hardware apparently but the problem here could be potentially that this motherboard may only support ECC Ram so none of the ram that I have will work in this motherboard and the problem is kind of compounded by the fact that each one of the ram slots is a channel so for me to run these CPUs that they're like full memory Rebound with I'm gonna have to buy 16 sticks of ECC Ram so this cheap mini core setup is turning ruinously expensive real fast now I don't know that that's the problem I feel like even with no Ram in it we should at least get fans spinning or something but it's not a consumer motherboard so I don't know and either way I am eventually gonna need the ram anyway so yeah with that let me go bankrupt myself buying ECC Ram quickly [Music] yay the massive amount of ECC Ram has finally arrived I'm not 100 sure it's actually going to work in this system because it doesn't have specific listed compatibility but so let's give it a try [Music] can't believe all of this this is going into one system [Music] I don't know I feel like they need to start putting just a little bit RGB on This Server crap I don't know what do you think okay so that is what 256 gigs worth of ram looks like in 16 channels very nice I really hope it turns on now now I've also swapped a smaller graphics card and this is an RX 5700 XT off of AliExpress uh just so that I can have easier access to like the front i o connectors and stuff because this one actually fits in the top slot oh it still doesn't work oh I think the graphics card out uh uh desperation growing I even consulted the manual like some kind of loser but I still couldn't get it running so I decided to go through the definitely not tedious process of removing all 700 sticks of RAM and CPUs and stuff to see if I could figure out what wasn't working oh no wow I clearly need to rethink my thermal paste application that is not ideal although that wouldn't be the reason why the system wasn't booting it would just make it catch on fire while running cinemage but let me remove this CPU and see if we can get it running with just one the CPU looks okay aside from like a little spot over here but I I don't know I can't tell oh but it still doesn't work let me swap out the one remaining Ram stick no that doesn't work either okay so that still didn't work so I think the next thing I'm gonna do is swap the CPUs in this socket oh I am real worried to see what the thermal paste application situation is going to look like under here let's a bit better than the other one actually now not wanting to drag this out too much I spent the next couple of hours trying every combination of CPU socket RAM and socket I and I just couldn't get it working I I didn't make a bit of progress we got some fans spinning at a point but that was it but it did help me come to the conclusion that one of the CPUs is definitely dead the other one is just maybe dead and the motherboard is maybe dead after that I decided to take the whole setup to a local recycling shop where the owner and I spent a while trying all of his various ECC RAM sticks in here and we also couldn't get it running so Kevin and I came to the conclusion that this suspiciously cheap server Hardware that I bought off of eBay it just isn't working it's it's broken so that's that's all I got for you today now I am in talks with the seller who insists that it is working uh so they're sending out a special kit of ram which they say will definitely work with it but once I see that not working I will still make a concerted effort to get a setup like this running from eBay parts so subscribe to the channel if you don't want to miss that video which will come out over the next couple of months when I can get that going but for the foreseeable future this did not work out so with that thank you very much for watching another pointless video and uh yeah until the next one bye [Music]",

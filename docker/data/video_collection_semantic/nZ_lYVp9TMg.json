    "transcript": "after the terrible experience with the cheapest gaming branded pre-built system from Amazon I decided to see if physical stores were any better so I bought the cheapest gaming pre-built from Best Buy to see if it is in fact a Best Buy or a worst buy but before we get to all that good stuff let's have a quick look at today's video sponsor which is extra extra has a great selection of very well made smart wallets the one that I decided to go with was the Parliament in this nice brown leather color and it just feels very premium and well-made just listen to that leather sound the Parliament is an RFID blocking card holder and it's been working really well for me over the last couple of weeks and the coolest feature about their wallets is the fact that you can get it with this GPS card tracker in certain thing and basically what that means is you can track your wallet if you're the kind of person that leaves it all around the place and it's also solar-powered so it recharges itself if this sounds good to you use my affiliate links in the description below and the code stay home to get a 30 percent discount on one of their products [Music] now first we need to determine what is the cheapest gaming branded prebuilt that you can buy at Best Buy now this is quite difficult to do because every location has different stock and considering the current human malware situation you can't actually go and browse the physical shops you have to order it online and then go pick it up at a specific location so how I ended up deciding on the PC for this video was looking for the cheapest gaming branded prebuilt that a location near me had in stock for a quick pickup another thing to bear in mind is the fact that I'm actually buying this at a Canadian Best Buy so it means they have slightly different stock and the pricing will also be a bit different I did go have a look at options at u.s. Best Buy locations and it seems like they actually have only more expensive pcs in stock in the US so I think this is actually a best-case scenario and with that quick disclaimer out of the way this is the PC that I got it's an Acer nitro 50 that I spent a thousand Canadian dollars on which translates roughly to about 710 US dollars which is a lot more expensive than the cheapest gaming branded prebuilt on Amazon but I think it's gonna be a lot more powerful so let's have a look at the PC that I got so I got my hands on this bad boy which is an Acer nitro 50 will discuss value later on in the video but right now let's cut it open and see what this little beast looks like it's got a pretty aggressive looking monobrow I wonder I wonder if it lights up straight off the bat we're starting with a disappointment because yeah this monobrow definitely doesn't light up although it does come with the DVD Drive so you can watch your pirated version of Wayne's World or whatever it is that people use DVD drives for as far as front io goes it's not that bad we've got a USB port I'm not sure if it's USB 3 or 2 doesn't really say anywhere and then we've got a type C port and an SD card reader and a microphone and headphones around the back we've got a fairly dodgy looking power supply it looks like it may not be allowed within 100 metres of a public swimming pool we've got a disabled HDMI port some USB ports an Ethernet jack some kind of audio connectors and then pretty dated looking rear i/o for a graphics card you've only got a DVI port and HDMI that's interesting considering the generation of graphics card in here but we'll have a closer look so now let's open it up oh wait there's there's no fan in here as well so I'm curious to see what the whole airflow situation looks like inside so with that let's open it up now unfortunately the inside of this PC isn't quite as hilarious as the inside of that cheapest Amazon prebuilt the wiring seems to have been done by a human being with two hands as far as the power supply goes it's actually an FSP unit which is 80 plus bronze rated so it's a reputable company I wouldn't be too worried about there being an arrest warrant out on this power supply over here we have a one terabyte Western Digital WD blue drive so that's nice for like a game drive or whatever there is also an SSD in here so I like the fact that they include both what's actually pretty hilarious about this system is they have this like pretty pretty rad looking red front ventilation but then it it leads to a solid metal panel this there's no room for airflow here like why is that there now as far as components go we've got a very generic looking gtx 1650 in here with yeah that's an interesting looking shroud we'll have a closer look at that just now as far as the cpu goes we've got an i-5 90 400 F which is a 6 core CPU it's ok it's not amazing for $700 but it's not the worst and then over here we've got a single 8 gig stick of RAM again 16 gigs really would have been nice [Music] now aside from the obvious challenge this is actually quite an interesting GPU design it's got a pretty huge fan on it and it's got a non standard PCB height it should be fine heatsink wise it's a pretty lame looking heatsink in there but it is a gtx 1650 it's a very low-power GPU so I think it should be fine we'll do some thermal tests later in the video the rear i/o of this gtx 1650 is slightly cut down compared to other retail versions of the graphics card that usually also come with the DisplayPort so they cut that out to save costs on the OEM version of this card I guess although it's not really that big a deal so with that let's put the whole thing back together and see how the system runs after digging around in this little Best Buy pre built thing I met a couple more whirring discoveries about it it doesn't actually seem to have an SSD in it I'm not entirely sure why I assumed a $700 gaming system in 2020 would have an SSD in it but apparently it doesn't if you're buying a new system please make sure that it has an SSD in it it just makes a really big difference when it comes to day to day usability if you want to see a video along those lines I've got one linked in the description below although I did make one fairly exciting discovery the monobrow does in fact line up so now we've got an all Acer bad ass gaming setup swag for the fortnight's I'm not sure if that's how you appeal to the younger audience before we get into the gaming performance and thermal tests and things like that I just want to quickly show you all of the bloatware that the system comes with because that's one of the biggest problems with buying a prebuilt or a laptop from a big company like Acer is they really they really crammed that bloatware in there and as you can see there's a long list of of terrible rubbish that you're probably gonna have to spend some time uninstalling in fact if you buy a prebuilt I would kind of recommend reinstalling Windows on it just because there's so much needless crap on it and then on a quick side note about the peripherals they are terrible I think it's the same stuff that they give with their standard office pcs so if you don't have a decent mouse and keyboard I would factor that into the cost as well because I've been gaming for the last day with these and it it really is an unpleasant gaming experience so now talking about the gaming experience let's have a look at some benchmarks of popular games that people may want to play on a system of this of this caliber [Music] [Music] as you can see when it comes to eSports titles realistically you don't need more performance in this system offers with games like dota csgo and Rainbow six fortnight is decent you're getting above 60 frames per second at 1080p although you do get occasional pretty bad stutters and I think that's down to the whole ramp issue the fact that you only have 8 gigs of RAM in the system is a pretty big letdown for me when it comes to a $700 system and that on top of the fact that you don't have an SSD again very salty about that the lack of RAM really shows in a game like escape from tarkov here you can see with 8 gigs it's really starting to push the limit of your RAM capacity and then when you throw 16 gigs of RAM in here you can see that escape from tarkov actually wants to use about 10 gigs of ram so it stutters way less than with just the 8 gigs that the system comes with and at $700 that's not really a sacrifice that I want to make and then finally let's just have a quick look at how hot all of the components run in this little case while gaming it's actually not that bad as you can see here after a long session of playing escape from tarkov we're sitting at the low 70 degrees on the CPU and the GPU but bear in mind the ambient temperature was 18 degrees Celsius in the room so yeah it could get pretty hot if you live in a hotter country so in conclusion let's have a quick discussion about value around this cheapest in store Best Buy gaming system I really wanted to like it the fact that it's only got a gtx 1650 in it and an i5 90 400 f i think would have been forgivable considering the convenience of a prebuilt however the fact that it doesn't have an SSD in it does make the day-to-day usability of the system more frustrating and not having 16 gigs of ram in a $700 gaming system that's just a sacrifice that I don't think you should be making at this price point I mean the RAM that they used in this system would have been embarrassing to use in a build 15 years ago how much could it possibly cost them to just add another stick in there and with that let me know in the comment section below what you think of the value of this cheapest best buy pre-built and also subscribe to the channel if you want to see a quick video where I make two small changes to the system to make it significantly better for for the price point you know just turn it into the system that it should have been in the first place if you enjoyed the video subscribe to the channel like I just said like the video share it with your friends check out all my social media in the description below and until the next video bye bye [Music]",

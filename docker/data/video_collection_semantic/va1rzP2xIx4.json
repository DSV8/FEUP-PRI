    "transcript": "As we reach the end of November, many of us get out the decorations and fa la la la la and whatnot. Im certainly no exception, especially when it comes to lighting. Why exactly do we litter our homes with light bulbs round Christmas time? Dont know, but its probably marketing. Bygolly it worked on me, though, and as a lighting enthusiast generally the opportunity to put hundreds of little light bulbs on railings and windows and shrubs andtrees and stuff is just impossible to pass up. But as you may very well know, I havea problem with the Christmas lighting industry. And that problemis LEDs. Dont get me wrong, I love LEDs! The light emitting diode is oneof the most important inventions of the last however many years. And some LED Christmaslights are great! But multi-colored LED Christmas lights usually arent. Ratherthan look festive and cheery and bright, modern LED Christmas light sets usually make itlook like a gaming PC exploded on your front lawn. If that aesthetic tickles your fancy, I will judgeyou but I wont get in your way. Have fun. But for the past several years I have been on a foolish quest to determine the best way to make modern LED Christmas lights look like old-fashionedincandescent Christmas lights. Luckily, some much-more-commited-than-me folks startedup Tru-Tone and now manufacture incredibly excellent LED versions of C7 and C9 bulbs. They are virtually indistinguishable from their energy-sucking incandescent counterparts and if thats something youre looking for, you should check them out. Theyre not payingme to say that, I bought these with my own money but they are exactly what Ive been hopingsomebody would do and if you live in North America (and are the same kind of weirdo I am) I think youll be more than pleased with them. However, Tru-Tone has not yet made inroads on tackling the mini-light problem. So here we go again. To explain what my problem is, in ye-oldendays we made light happen by making tiny bits of tungsten wire very very hot. Hot things producelight through incandescence, and when its hot enough a whole bunch of wavelengths of light willbe emitted which together look white. When we wanted to make that look a color other-than-white, wed add a coating to the glass of the light bulb which acted to filter out most wavelengthsaside from our target color. The result was a sort of blend of wavelengths that produced apleasing (if reduced in brightness) appearance. LEDs, on the other hand, only emit a singlewavelength of light which depends on the materials used to create it. That monochromaticlight has an incredibly intense color because it is literally pure as can be - its likethe color wheel picker on your image editing app. A perfectly pure hue. Some of youmay like this. Even I like it at times. But for Christmas lights? Its just wrong. Especially greens and blues - that is not a warm and fuzzy looking festive display, its atacky storefront with those chasing LED strips around the windows letting you know they haveCBD oil. Im sorry, thats just the truth! If the blue and the green could be toned down abit, Id probably be a little less grumpy about this. A large part of why LED multicoloredsets and incandescent multi-colored sets look so starkly different is that the filament inan incandescent light doesnt produce a whole lot of the green-to-blue wavelengths (that wouldrequire getting tungsten into melty temperatures and those bulbs wouldnt last long at all). So, through pure physics reasons the blue and green will appear quite a lot darker than reds,oranges, and especially yellows. A multi-colored LED set that just mimicked those relative brightness ratios would be a huge improvement. There are reasons thats difficult, though. Something something voltage drop, gallium nitride, et cetera. But theres another way: throughlots of innovation involving phosphor coatings excited by blue to near-UV diodes, weve madeextremely good and reasonably broad-band white LEDs that are quite cheap. So, why dont we justmake a whole bunch of white diodes and put a colored cap over them a la the way we used to doit? Then we could have the best of both worlds! Just to make sure that hasnt happened yetand, side note, somebody please just do it so I can end this! I went to a couple of bigbox stores to see what their big boxes had in store. The first thing of note: Europe isinvading! Traditionally, light sets over here just have raw mains voltage going through them. A set of 100 mini-lights will actually have two runs of 50 bulbs wired in series. The bulbsare rated for somewhere near 2.5 volts and with them all in series that adds up to 125 volts (the bulbs actually fail as a short circuit which keeps the rest of the strand lit usually sothey build some margin in for that). C9 and C7 sets supply straight line voltage to each bulbsocket which, fun fact, is why those sets have polarized plugs and mini-light sets dont. Thisis a note to editor me, make sure you put that little asterisk in there about how some olderC7 and C9 sets were also in series. Did you do it? Good! Now, though, LED light strands that come withlittle power adapters that make some flavor of not-line-voltage are starting to become available. And new form factors, too! Most LED sets have been mimicking the shape of incandescent lights butnow we have so-called rice lights - and these have some built-in chasing functions to makethings interesting. And then theres these ribbon lights which seem to be a play on LEDtape light but with diodes in little blobs. Both of these are intriguing, though I must saythat ribbon light doesnt look too durable, but sadly the multi-colored sets still look like something a unicorn threw up so I had to pass. Also interesting, some of the traditionalLED sets for sale are starting to come withnon-replaceable bulbs. To be honest, thisannoyed me at first. But Ive come around to this probably being better. Until this year,every one of these sets Ive seen has technically had replaceable bulbs but they were made justlike the incandescent sets of the past. In fact, it was often the legs of the LEDbent around the bulb holder just like the tiny wire leads of the incandescentmini-lights. Corrosion was a major problem there, plus the bulbs could sometimes end up fallingout which would kill the whole strand, so sealing the whole thing up is likely going to make the set more durable in the long-run. Alas, when it came to the colors, everythingwas either decent warm white or shield your eyes multi-colored so its time yet again totry my luck at figuring out how to make these less awful. Heres a summary of things Ive triedin the past. Sharpies: worked great but quickly faded in the sun and/or rain. Spray paint: didntwork at all. Acrylic craft paint: didnt work at all. Transparent acrylic craft paint: workedsurprisingly well! Durability testing didnt happen, though, because I forgot. Nail polish:another surprise hit! Probably the easiest of all and durability was probably decent but againactual testing didnt happen because I forgot. But thats all Ive tried so far. At least Ithink. Wait - I forgot about the Rit dye: That also didnt work. The heat from the dying processmade the lights get all bendy, too. Surely theres something better out there. And for your viewingpleasure and my sense of ennui, its time to once again test some light bulb painting techniques. Onthe docket today are epoxy resin and dyes for said epoxy resin, then we have a twist on acryliccraft paint involving some water and glue, and finally we have a mystery third thing. Stay tuned for that one. It worked pretty good! I started this years shenanigans with epoxyresin. I ordered some and some dyes for it and thought this might work OK. But athought is not the same as an experiment, and I dont have room for thought experiments. Anyway so I mixed some up, added some dye to it, and hoped for the best. I started with bluebecause this is the trickiest color - I want a nice deep blue, so it needs to have quite a lotof dye. But go too far and it might be black. Turns out that wasnt a problem here. Despiteadding quite a lot of dye to the resin, the mixture added hardly any color in the thinskim-coating that I knew Id need. And this is something that I need to touch on - in all myattempts here, people are (quite helpfully) suggesting things I should try but a lotof the suggestions Ive received turn out to have nowhere near as much color as I need. Things like stained glass paint or colored heat shrink tubing just arent dark enough - the glass of an unlit incandescent set looks nearly black on all colors but yellow or amber. So if this was gonna work, Id need way more dye. After adding way more dye, I was starting to getworried that there would be too much dye for the resin to cure properly. But there was only oneway to find out. After making the concoction so dark as to appear black, things looked promisingat first but then quickly became the opposite of that. Test-dunks revealed just how tricky thebalance is here between too dark and not dark enough - the light goes from hardly visible to just right to too pale in a matter of moments. Add to this the general difficulty of gettingthe coating thickness I wanted (this resin was extremely runny and even after waiting over an hour, despite thickening quite a bit,it would still run off eventually) and epoxy was ruled out completely. My next trick was to try the milk glass coating I stumbled upon through sheer dumb luck. I got these table lamps from the Swedish meatball placelast year and while they are pretty cool looking, having bare light bulbs in your peripheralvision kind of sucks so I wanted to frost the glass. But not frost it likethe translucent kind of frosting, but the opaque white kind of frosting, andthere werent any good guides on how to do this so I just tried equal parts (by weight)water, white craft paint, and PVA glue and by golly it worked perfectly! The lamps stilllook great, no cracking or yellowing, and if youre interested in learning more about this process you can check out the video on Connextras. I thought I would try this techniquefor Christmas lights but using colored paint instead of just white. So Imixed some up, dunked the bulbs, and thought that perhaps I had crackedit! But then the coating cracked. Yeah, not sure if its because it was on plastic or what but the coating shrank and cracked and generally didnt hold up. I also tried just half glue andhalf paint (the water made the mixture a little runnier than I think I wanted) but this alsodidnt dry well. Again, I started with blue and since both of those two techniques didnt work Ipromptly gave up. Even if this had worked well, it still had that frosted look which I would haveaccepted but wasnt exactly what I was going for. So, back to the drawing board. The absolutebest end-result I have gotten so far came from transparent craft paint. But, it was fiddlyand annoying to apply. I mean, lets be real, this whole endeavor is objectively ridiculous. I am a ridiculous person who is committed to the bit, but if Im gonna keep doing thisI want something just a little bit easier. But then I noticed that one of my bottles ofpaint - the yellow one thats been sitting on the shelves behind me for what, two yearsnow? - says Airbrush colors on it. Now, Ive never had a need for an airbrush (usually I use a comb) but if thats what its designed for maybe anairbrush would help. So I got one! Did I just search on Amazon for airbrush kit andbuy the most obvious one? Yep! Do I really know how to use an airbrush? Nope! Did that stop me? Nope! But having the airbrush is only one part of the problem. The other was how to hold the lights tomake airbrushing possible. Now, as Ive discussed previously, I really dont care for many of thecolor combinations on offer today. My preference is a simple four-color palette of red, green,blue, and yellow. I will accept amber or orange in place of yellow, but teals and purples and pinks are completely unacceptable because those are Easter colors and that comes later. Those colorsdo not belong in Christmas light sets! Capiche? As luck would have it, the very four colors Iwanted were available in a set of transparent airbrush paint. I bought new paint justin case the old paint was going bad, and that yellow bottle was already separatingtwo years ago so its much worse now. And if for whatever reason I were tochange my mind about color preferences, different colors could be made by mixing these primary colorstogether. Just ask your kindergarten teacher! So, knowing that Id be spraying a strand of onehundred mini lights in my objectively correct preference of red, yellow, green, and blue, I took a spare piece of cardboard from one of those Amazon boxes and used a single hole punchto make 26 holes along its edge. Then I taped over one of them because I only needed 25. AndI meticulously poked every fourth light through those holes and then taped some printer paper tothe edges of the piece of cardboard to protect the rest of the set from overspray. Then I picked this gravity-fed airbrush from my airbrush kit because that would probably work, shook up the blue paintbottle, put some paint in the cup, and went at it. And by golly, it worked! It worked greatly! The blue paint was actually a perfect color, the airbrush made applying it nearly effortless, and after a couple of coats it was exactly what I was looking for. Of course theonly thing left to do was let it dry, clean out the airbrush, then pullout all the now blue bulbs and shove another quarter of them through the holesto prepare for the next color. Then repeat. This was still a pretty fiddly process, but itsdefinitely the least fiddly of any Ive tried. In fact the primary fiddle factor was dealingwith the light-holding rig while untangling and wrangling and retangling the rest ofthe strand. If I were to do this again, I would try to find a better way to holdthem. Maybe a large piece of cardboard with holes made by a drill press orsomething could tackle five strandsat a time - though how to keep themorganized would be quite the question. And the end results, while pretty great, still reveal a few flaws. For one, I had forgotten that the last time I used these paints the yellow was very much a highlighter yellow and it benefitted from adding a bit of red to warmit up. I should have done that again. This red is also not quite transparent - interestingly I found the same thing last time with this different brand of transparent model paint so my guessis its an inherent issue with red pigmenting. Another thing to consider is thatapparently this paint benefits from heat treatment. Whether that can be safelydone without melting the plastic caps I dont know. I didnt try and Im not goingto. This year, I am going to actually put this strand outside where it will be exposed both to the Southern sun and the just lovely weather we get around here. Ill report backon its durability on the second channel - so maybe subscribe there if you havent. Illtry to do one of those community posts too. Now, you might ask, why are you doingthis to yourself? and my response would be thats an excellent question. Broadly, Ijust want to show that this can be done! Yes, maybe Im just a curmudgeon whos out of touch, but I really would like to use LED multicolored lighting round the holidays because incandescentlight sets use a stupid amount of power! Last year my power bill doubled for the month of December merely because I had two C9 sets and I wanna say six runs of twinkling lights running for 8 hours a night. Thats ridiculous, especially considering I have an electric car! But all the multicoloredstrands on the market today still look like gamer vomit and thats just not something I want all over myhome at any time but especially not the holidays! And theres good news out of the UK! A viewergot in touch and sent me pictures of a light strand that is EXACTLY what Im asking for. Its a set very much like this one but where the diodes are all a nice warm white andits coloring comes from the plastic caps that define the shape of the pseudo-bulb. Inthis case, I think the coloring might not be quite as strong as Id like - I worry thisis more of a pastel color theme than the rich colors Im looking for. But it showssomebody could make this if they just tried. So, one of you in charge of ordering all thoselights from whatever factories overseas make them, maybe try and steer things in this direction. And to the folks at Tru-Tone - you could be those people! I will be incredibly happy if I can just...buy these and not go through this nonsense just to get some semblance of the things Im looking for. And if somebody finally manages to make this a thing I can get in stores with all the otherholiday stuff... you all had better buy them! Ok? I dont want to find out that the gross blue-greenlaser beam lights are actually what you people want! I will be so disappointed and youll neverhear the end of it, I promise. Happy holidays! Unexpectedly Christmas Jazz But, multicolored [ ] LED I should have them ready to demonstrate. Modern LED christmas light sets usuallymake it what happened there? What did you get caught on, you terrible thing? mimicked the relative brightness ratios would be crap. I changed the tense of something for no reason [clears throat] Different colors could be made by mixing these primary colors together. Justk ask your [ppfttah!] Different colors could be made by mixing these primary colors together. Just ask yourtche why am I struggling with that? [a jazz rendition of We Wish You A Merry Christmas fades back in] Now look at all those pretty twinkling lights. Devastatingly, I think Menards has discontinued them. Now I don't feel so bad about hoarding them these last few years.",

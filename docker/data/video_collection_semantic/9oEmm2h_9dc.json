    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine! As you know, I'm a huge Apple fan and many of you guys have been like Justine, talk about the gates, talk about beauty-gate, talk about charge-gate. Uh, I'm gonna talk about it, I'm not sure what you want me to say about it other than my front facing camera makes me look beautiful, and I don't have a problem with charge-gate. My phone charges perfectly fine. Now I'm not saying that these aren't issues. What, at least my phone isn't exploding or catching on fire, that's all I'm saying. Crossing our fingers that that doesn't happen to anybody no matter what type of phone you're using. Anyway, it's been about two weeks since I got my phone and I still love it. I also am a huge Samsung fan, I love my Google Pixel. I love phones, I love technology, and I tend to gravitate towards Apple. I am a big iPhone fan, but that's not to say that I don't enjoy other phones. I like Android. I prefer iOS, and guess what? So do a lot of other people. The thing is, Android is on so many phones that it's kinda hard to get one sort of experience on it whereas iOS is only on one device, so. I don't even know where I'm going with this. I just like trying to get all the Android fanboys all fired up and angry, and leaving angry comments because I think it's funny actually, the fighting in the comments that happens about Mac versus PC versus Android versus iOS. People can use whatever they want, it's not really that big of a deal. There are preferences. If everyone liked the same thing, this world would be incredibly boring. So a few weeks ago, I also filmed a photo test video and a video test video, which I never even ended up posting. I got so overwhelmed shooting so many iPhone videos that by the time it came to start editing the photo and video review video with the iPhone X, the iPhone XS Max, and the Note9, I was like I can't do this right now, so I just didn't. And I figured that I would take some of that footage and content and put it into another video, so that's the video that you guys are watching right now. So I'm not sure if it's safe to say that beauty-gate is a filter, because I don't think anyone has really come out with what exactly it is. I read a few articles. There's one that it saying that it's the noise reduction, but when I initially took that photo, I was kinda thinking it was the smart HDR because basically what it felt it was doing was it was pulling out all of the shadow, so it was kinda just making a very evenly lit photo. Okay I wanna show you a difference between selfies. - Oh, you look bad there! - Hey, that's my face! - [Jenna] You look beautiful there! - Well no, 'cause the super HDR - No, the lighting. - 'Cause it brings out the contrasts and everything. - Wow. - Like look at that. - [Jenna] That looks really good. - Right? - [Jenna] Wow. - I'm impressed. - [Jenna] I'm very impressed. - [Justine] Me, too, very neat. - [Jenna] Yeah, it looks great. - Which one looks like more in person? Don't answer the question! Do you guys wanna go to Buca di Beppo tonight? - [Jenna] Oh my God. (laughing) - Would someone please go to Buca di Beppo with me? Anyway, let's carry on with the camera test. Today we're going to be testing out the photo and video from the iPhone XS Max, the Note9, and the iPhone X. We're at the beach. It's really, really hot and really, really bright, so hopefully we can get some photos. - [Jenna] Test out the water resistance! - They did say that they have tested out the new iPhone XS is salt water conditions, but I don't want to do that. (upbeat music) Gotta get the mobile rig setup. So we have these little tripods, these little mobile clamps. Jenna has got all three phones and she's about to do the first photo test. The first thing that we're gonna do is we're just gonna take straight, normal pictures. Nothing crazy, no portrait effect, no live focus on the Samsung Note9, just a normal freaking picture. - [Jenna] You sure that's what you wanna do? - Alright, no, I'm not. Now do a portrait mode one. - [Jenna] Okay. - And live focus on the Samsung. I feel like I'm gonna fall over. Now I'm gonna test out the backlight, so I'm gonna have you get in front of me here. We'll have the sun facing my back. There's bugs! Flying all around me! Oh, they're crawling through the cracks in my shirt! So I'm just gonna take a few pictures of just the scenery and we can compare those. - You look like an angel! This phone is a lie. (gasping) - I don't even know if I can all be in all of these shots at the same time. - [Jenna] Oh my God. - Okay, just for my on reference of editing. This is iPhone X, this is XS Max, this is Note. So hello. Can you see me Jenna? - [Jenna] In which one? - In all of them! - [Jenna] Yeah, I can see you. - We've got all three of our cameras here. Uh, maybe move around a little, see what it looks like. (chill music) Wowie. (Jenna laughs) Okay. - [Jenna] How about this? - Wow, it is. It's so bright. I think that I'm in all of the frames, so we're just gonna take a slow, slow walk over here. Move around a little bit. Well that's our front facing test. Another thing that I've noticed is it does auto-focus way faster. So we're gonna see how long it takes to focus on the bag. This is a bad test. - [Jenna] We're gonna have to take your word for it. - And if you don't wanna take my word for it, hey there's still more to this video, so let's go take some more pictures. So now we're testing out the rear video in all three of these phones, so let's get up real close, real personal. iPhone XS Max, Samsung Galaxy Note9, and the iPhone X. iPhone XS Max, Samsung Galaxy Note9, and the iPhone X. Which one looks best? Which one looks the best? Record, record. Hello everyone. This here is the iPhone X, this is the Note, and this here is the new iPhone XS Max. The stereo, let's try that out on the iPhone XS. So here I am, the stereo recording. (singing) Alright, so which one do you think looks the best? iPhone XS Max, the Samsung Galaxy Note9, or the iPhone X? What do you guys think? Think about it. I'm gonna put a poll right here, or maybe it's right here. Wherever it is, which one do you think looks the best so far? So a lot of you guys have been asking me if I've been affected by charge-gate. So charge-gate is affecting some phones where the display isn't on, so the phone is asleep. And you plug it in. And normally that should start charging, but it's not. It's just not doing anything. But it will start charging if you tap the screen, turn it on, wake it up. I don't have that problem. I'm gonna just double check. Let's try it just to see. Cord is here. (upbeat music) Plug it in. (phone beeps) Okay, it's charging. Let's try it again, phone is off. Plugging it in. (phone beeps) It's charging. Phone is locked. (phone beeps) And it's charging. Okay, well I don't have charge-gate. The thing that I've been most freaking out about is getting used to the big phone again. This phone, it's huge, like the screen is massive which I absolutely love having this much screen real estate. The one thing that I do miss is the previous version, well the iPhone XS and the X, a perfect sized phone to fit in yoga pants. My sister and I do a lot of hikes, so this phone is just slightly a little bit too big for the pockets of my yoga pants. So it keeps just sticking out of the top, whereas the previous version was, it was the perfect size. So really that's been the only issue that has been a little bit of a struggle for me is trying to figure out do I want to keep the bigger phone, or do I want the smaller one? But then I went back to using the smaller phone, and having this much screen. Like this thing just looks so beautiful and so crisp that I don't really want to switch back to the smaller phone. I know, these are dumb iJustine first world problems, but this is my channel and this is my video, and you guys know that I'm an Apple fan, and I make a lot of videos about iPhones! So I don't think that I need to justify my issues. Do I? I've definitely noticed that my battery life has been a lot better. Usually by like five or six o'clock, I feel like my phone was completely dead, and I would never leave the house, not even to walk to dog without having a mophie with me, so I do feel like I can probably make it until about nine or ten. Well I just wanted to make a quick little video because all of you guys have been tweeting me and freaking out about the beauty-gates, and the charge-gates, and all of the gates. And I just thought that I should probably address it because I honestly have just been super busy doing other things and I have not had time to make a video about it. Here it is, I'm talking about it. I think beauty-gate, I love beauty-gate. Maybe it was the iPhone X that wasn't realistic. Maybe this is what I really look like. I'm not sure. But either way, the photos and video that I have been getting from the iPhone have been so amazing. I did an entire vlog traveling to London. If you guys wanna see that, I'll put a link in the description and an annotation so you guys can see the full range of what this camera is really capable of doing on a daily basis. A lot of you guys have said Justine, is this phone something that I can vlog on? Yes, it is. The audio is even really good. I shot half of that iPhone XS video in stereo and the other half not in stereo so that I could kinda do a test. It was more a test for myself, but I don't think I even mentioned in the video that I did that. So if you do go and watch that, watch with that in mind and see if you guys can tell when I turn the stereo off and when it was on. Well thank you guys for watching. If you did make it this far in the video, I appreciate it. I had so much fun making all of the iPhone videos during iPhone week. My sister and I spent a lot of time shooting those and I spent so much time editing that I felt like at some point I was like oh, I gotta stop, I've posted so many iPhone videos, I just need a small little break. So now that that break is over, hello, I'm back. I do want to make a small little promise to you guys that I will start posting more vlogs. Not like a lot, maybe more than once every three months. I felt like there was a point where vlogging wasn't fun anymore, and it became a forced activity. So since I've taken some time away from it, when I went to London I was like wow, I really actually missed vlogging, and telling a story, and editing vlogs. I will see you guys in my next video. If you guys aren't already subscribed, please do so. And hit the bell so you'll be notified when I post new videos. And I would love to hear from you guys in the comments below: are you an Android fan, are you an iOS fan, do you not really care? I can't even tell you how much Jenna and I have been using walkie talkie. (watch beeps) Hey, I'm just telling the internet how much we love walkie talkie. Okay, well I think she's unavailable. She really this video segment. Okay, I'm gonna go. I'm just rambling at this point, so I'll see you guys in my next video, bye! (upbeat music)",

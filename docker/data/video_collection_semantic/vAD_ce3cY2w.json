    "transcript": "- [Riley] Tech news never sleeps. But it should think about napping or something, cause it's been kind of cranky lately. And then I have to deal with it. YouTube disabled the public dislike counter a month ago, and people are still ragging on the platform about the decision because, it sucks. It's super dumb. Time to change the subject. So YouTube just released its first ever copyright transparency report, which reveals the platforms Copyright Claims process isn't as broken as it looks. Apparently more than 2.2 million or about 60% of disputed copyright claims are resolved in the uploader's favor. The report also says 99% of claims were auto-generated by YouTube content ID and less than 1% of those were disputed. So I guess we should thank YouTube for being so good at maintaining a social platform we all love. Hey, wait a second. This report was released days after Ludwig, a top Twitch streamer that defected to YouTube had one of his first YouTube streams stopped by a copyright warning for playing 'Baby Shark', Andy's favorite song. And before YouTube could explain what happened, he went on his second channel and said he was suspended. Everyone disliked the video obviously to try and say he was wrong, but they all started singing the song together, and that's the worst. You might want to hold off on sending any pixel devices to Google for service, at least for a little while. A recent report indicates a video game developer had her account compromised after it was sent to Google service center, presumably by a worker there and that private photos were accessed in an attempt to, you guessed it, find nudes. Was the internet out that day or what is wrong with people? Whoever the perp was also disabled security alerts, in an attempt to cover their tracks. And this comes on the heels of a similar report, last week. Google is investigating the issue, but the timing is ultra ironic considering Google Photos is rolling out a locked folder feature to securely store private photos on your device and off the cloud. Ooh, might want to consider switching to iPhone, the privacy focused device, where all your photos are being scanned. No come on! They can have your photos? - [Chase] Yeah. - [Riley] You want them to have your nudes? - [Chase] Yes. - [Riley] Chase that's. And there's been another major crypto heist as exchange Bitmart is out nearly $200 million worth of cryptocurrency, including Ethereum and Shiba. Bitmart has since frozen withdrawals for the time being until a review can be conducted. But the theft underscores the inherent risks of leaving your crypto on a public exchange. Which kind of goes against the whole idea of the block chain, no? For, maybe for a technology that is supposed to protect against theft by giving everyone a copy of the ledger, there sure have been a good number of crypto heists lately and even stranger except for the right clicker scurge. No one's stealing actual NFTs. Huh? They're worthless. Now it's time for quick bits brought to you by Build Redux, the PC builders striving to bring PC gaming to the masses with no price markups. You'll pay the same price for components that you'd pay, if you bought them yourself. Just with a flat $75 fee to have your PC built by a PC building expert. With a huge brain and, and capable arms. Just want them to hold me. Just select your budget, pick your games that you want to run and see how they perform right on the website and let Redux take care of the rest. All builds come with a two year warranty. So click the link in the description and start creating your PC today. Oh, the quick bits have decided to stop whooshing around so fast for a second and give us a visit. We love them. The Oculus name looks like it's going away for good as starting early next year, Meta is going to start dropping the brand for its VR lineup. And instead, just go with Meta. So we'll be talking about the Meta quest, instead of the Oculus quest for example. I guess we'll just ignore how Meta quest sounds like some kind of super low budget tabletop game, that I do want to play because sometimes those are the best. So. If you buy your PC games through the Xbox app on Windows, you might see a notification telling you how a game should perform on your computer. The feature is currently in testing and doesn't support every title. But it should be a quick way to know what to expect. If you're confused about hardware requirements, which I imagine probably isn't a unusual situation with an Xbox game or playing on PC for the first time. They don't, they don't know anything. Twitter suspended the accounts of a dozen reporters and researchers after they were reported themselves for violating the site's policy on private images. But those reports were false, as they were apparently made by extremists, trying to silence their critics. The accounts have since been restored, but I wonder how Twitter made such a mistake. If there were only a dozen accounts to review. It's almost like it's all just computers in there. And if you live in New York, you might be able to get your groceries faster than ever as DoorDash is trying out a 15-minute grocery delivery service in Manhattan. At first, it's going to be based out of just one location in the Chelsea neighborhood between 7:00 AM and 2:00 PM. But the plan is to expand to more locations in the near future. DoorDash is even hiring dedicated employees instead of using contractors for this. So here's hoping they'll actually deliver on that 15 minute time limit instead of always relying on Spiderman to pick up the slack. - [Chase] Riley where's my bread? - [Riley] It's pizza time. We're doing Spiderman this week. Spiderman 2. And I think I've used about as much slack as they can give me. So this episode's over, come back on Wednesday for more tech news, and I assure you, I will give you some.",

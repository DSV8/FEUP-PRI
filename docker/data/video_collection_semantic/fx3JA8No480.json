    "transcript": "today's video is gonna get a bit stupid the crazy thing is I still need to add six fans to this monstrosity which was all made possible by be quiet and their awesome new silent Wing Pro 4S sponsoring this video all of it the whole thing is a nice gaggle of fans look at those beautiful silent Wing Pro 4S by be quiet behind today's experiment which feels like a bit of a grandiose turn for what I'm doing here to be honest is can we get more performance from an air cooler by stacking a whole bunch of fans onto it and at what point does it stop benefiting from it and considering that be quiet sent over 14 of their amazing silent Wing Pro 4 fans we can take this experiment pretty far today and now we're gonna start off by just getting a baseline we're gonna Mount this pure rock 2 FX onto the I5 12 600k with one Majestic silent Wing Pro 4. let's just ignore the brand of thermal paste we're using very nice one hour later okay so a bit of a problem I may have slightly lost the LGA 1700 mounting hardware for this pure rock 2 cooler uh which means we're now gonna have to use an AMD CPU instead little bit of a whoopsie now again we just need to ignore the thermal paste brand there we go very nice be quiet silent Wing Pro 4 number one foreign look at that bearing nice in terms of run I'm going to use this very bare and slightly indecent 266 megahertz kit because it's the lowest profile Ram I have available with this naked kit we won't have any clearance issues later on when we very professionally staple on a whole bunch of fans to the scooter for our control we have our single silent Wing Pro 4 and we're gonna run Ida 64 for about 10 minutes because it's just an air cooler and then once we've taken the temperature we'll start adding fans and build the fanasaurus Rex now at 10 minutes it's been stable for a while and we have a tea die of 72 degrees Celsius which is the temperature to beat now first off we are going to do a very reasonable upgrade we're just going to add a single pull fan on the other side of the cooler and see what that does ah there's nothing quite like having a big juicy pile of be quiet silent Wing Pro 4S to work through okay well this is the last time this whole thing's gonna look normal so at 10 minutes adding a fan in pull has made about a two to three degree difference which is not nothing but now I think it's time to move on from this pathetic two fan setup and get serious for the next couple of fans that we're going to be adding it's not going to be quite as straightforward as just clipping them to the cooler manufacturers don't really make facilities for adding more than two fans to an air cooler because why would they and the problem is slightly compounded with these be quiet silent Wing Pro 4S because if you look at the edge of the fan there isn't a gap between the two mounting points like there is on a lot of other fans which means we can't just mount it using the one side and then use the other side for zip tying because well there's a solid bit of plastic in the way again because why wouldn't there be right now I have a couple of options the first one is to use clamps to just clamp the fans to the cooler which could work you know we've got lots of variability meaning we can potentially clamp quite a lot of fans to a cooler but clamps are big and cumbersome and metal and heavy so it doesn't feel like a very good idea but ugly I have a second idea using an age-old David mounting method that we've not seen on the channel in a while duct tape now the first fan is gonna Mount Connor like that uh but actually wait a minute I kind of want to use a less chunky graphics card just so that I have easier access to Fan duct tape now I'm gonna see if we can get away with just using duct tape on the sides because I don't want to ruin the aesthetic of the whole thing here no that's very important now with the first bit of stacking that we're going to be doing we are running into a bit of a problem with the clip but again luckily the duct tape is gonna help us seal up nicely on the pool side we are running into a little bit of a clearance issue because of the rear i o so it does mean that on this side initially we are going to have a bit of a skew match hopefully that doesn't impact airflow too much like that wow that is already looking really badass let's see if it makes a difference now at 10 minutes the temperatures are pretty much identical which is a bit disappointing but I guess it means we just need more power quick side note be quiet stuff really lives up to their name it is so quiet I can only hear the graphics card actually this is getting pretty wild foreign girth is starting to make me feel a little insecure the crazy thing is we still have six beautiful be quiet silent Wing Pro 4S to enter this monstrosity but before we get to that let's see it's made any difference to the temperatures that is the same number it was before it's not getting any better but I think the problem is we don't have quite enough be quiet silent Wing Pro fours so let's fix that foreign so that gives us space for six more fans now we just need to download some unspecified software so that we can get the additional six be quiet silent Wing Pro 4S to run at the same speed as the other be quiet silent Wing probe Force and now we just need to add the final Crown Jewel to this amazing be quiet silent Wing Pro for creation and it's done but it's about a degree better than it was before and all it took was adding 12 extra fans very worth it",

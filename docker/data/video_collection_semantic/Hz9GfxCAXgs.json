    "transcript": "(Crab Rave music overlapping) - Oh man, (laughing) I am friggin stoked to unbox this thing, because... Well, at least if HP's claims are correct, it is very light, obscenely powerful, it looks beautiful, and... It's just got all of it. Everything. Every single thing you could want in a laptop, (hand smacking) is in here. Apparently. And, I'm really stoked to try it out. In here, we have the HP ZBook Studio G8. (cardboard sliding) Longer name, but it's a professional laptop, but it's also kind of a gaming laptop. It's a bit weird, but very, very, cool. - [Andy] Can you game professionally? - Yeah, professionals wanna game to. You wanna be able to expense your gaming PC. (laughs) (grunts) Let's get into her though. (cardboard scraping) Very nice box, I do have to say. Ooh. Very nice looking laptop, I do have to say. What else do we have in here? Oh, it smells good too. We've got a power adapter. It's not Type-C which is a bit unfortunate, but it's also 200 watts, which is way more than you can do over Type-C currently, so... That's cool. Like I said, this thing's a friggin beast. And, that's it. (laughs) First impressions, this is a fine looking machine. It's just... It's basically just aluminum, but at the same, it's basically just aluminum, and it looks sick. We have what looks like diamond cut finish along the edges. And, aside from that, it's pretty much a bog standard looking laptop. Although this Z on the top does look pretty fancy. Prio, on the side, we only have a Type-A and a 3.5 headphone. Other side, full size SD card. Love to see that. Mini display port for some reason, and two thunderbolts, and there's your DC input. Yeah, kind of like I said before, this is one of the most laptop looking laptops I've seen in quite some time. Like, there's no way to fault it, but at the same time, there's not a whole lot special going on here. But, I kinda think that that's a good thing, 'cause like I said before, this is the gaming laptop that you're able to expense to your work. So, I guess, do we just turn it on Jono? - [Jono] Yeah, but before that... - Yeah, before that... Thanks Eufy, for sponsoring today's video. Get the security you need with the Floodlight Cam 2 Pro without the monthly subscription. The camera has 360 degrees of movement, with tilt, and almost entirely eliminates blind spots. Their built in AI automatically locks onto human movement, and then tracks and records the footage. Eufy Floodlight has an impressive 40 foot range to light up a wide area for better camera recording when it is set off. It works with Alexa and Google Assistant. Eufy has an exclusive discount so check it out at the link in the video description. (hip hop beat) There's lights on now. There we go. So, (laughs) this has what HP is calling the first commercial RGB keyboard. - [Jono] What does that mean? - It's the first professional... RGB keyboard? I don't know. First impressions, this screen is fan-freaking-tastic. Yeah, I confirmed we have the 4k OLED model here, and it looks just so good. Like, it does have... I've complained in the past about OLED displays, because they have, kind of, this weird, grainy texture. And, this one does definitely have it. Like, if I get there, I can start to see it. But... Damn. That is a fine looking display. Oh, so this is really cool. So, this little... Squares thingy here is actually a macro-key that you can assign to do different things if you hit like, ALT, that thing, CTRL, SHIFT, And, you're able to do stuff like opening an application, normal macro executing a key sequence, or just, you know, a text here. So, I could be like, you hit SHIFT, the macro button, and it puts in your mailing address, let's say, for an email. - [Andy] Or, you could just map it to Lttstore.com. - Yeah, (laughs) let's do that right now. Press it. Enter text. Lttstore.com. Apply. Press that. Lttstore.com Boom. Done. Easy. (laughs) Wow, and that's very colorful on this display. (laughs) - [Jono] There are a lot more new lanyards. - And, we also have this GPU T-shirt, which I really like. Why do you wanna Linus plushie? - [Jono] They look cool! - I just... I find it weird. To have just like, (ominous music) a Linus staring at you in your home, what about that? - [Jono] If we sell a lot of them, maybe we can make you one next. - I don't want a plushie of myself. I don't know what people are doing with those. You know, we're just going straight to Crab Rave. That is a good looking Crab Rave. Let's crank it. I imagine the speakers are great, 'cause it's an HP laptop. (Crab Rave plays) Look at those blacks. Okay, that's pretty good. We need to do a... More scientific tests here to figure out... I don't know if it quite has the bass of XPS. (Crab Rave overlapping) Wow, that sounds terrible. Um. (laughs) (Crab Rave plays) Okay, so they have the HP right here. Is that at full? Mmm. (Crab Rave continues to play) Calling a winner is gonna be difficult here. The HPs got a bit more in the high end, but the Dell definitely has a bit more down low. Like, that's really clear. It's like, snappy. They're both great. I don't want to call a winner, 'cause it's (laughs) so similar. And, looking at the displays, side by side, you can't really tell here. To my eyes, they look essentially identical, which makes a lot of sense, 'cause we have two color accurate displays that are accurately displaying colors. (chuckles) So, unsurprisingly, they look the same. Going back to the specs though, they are just obnoxiously good on this thing. Like, we can say it's a draw with the screen and keyboard between the XPS 15 and this guy right here. But, as far as performance goes, this thing just... I'm trying to think of an description that's not explicit, but like, (hand smacks) this guy's got a 3070. That's just... (smack) Absolute beat down on a 3050. (laughs) - [Jono] Damn. - Yeah. And, this thing's available with up to a 3080. Given the size of it, this is, like, not a portly laptop, I feel like you're not gonna get the full experience of a 3080 in it, because like, the RTX 3070 and 3080 on mobile uses the same DI. The 3070 just has a couple CUDA cores chopped off. So, in my opinion, you should probably just go for the 3070. Save yourself a couple bucks. Well, save your boss a couple bucks. And, you'll have a very similar time. Also, for the CPU, we have an i9-11950H. That's eight cores. I think up to 5.2... 5.3GHz. It's real fast. 32 gigabytes of RAM. I've got a two (chuckles) terabyte SSD. Intel WiFi 6. It's... Yeah, it's just as fast as you can get in a laptop, pretty much. What's, maybe, the most interesting though, we have the OLED option here for the display. But, they also have a 4K 120Hz model, which is just so friggin good. Now, like we can't really do proper performance testing here on Short Circuit, but I want to get in the 120Hz model of this, and just see if HP's... Engineering creator laptop could potentially be the best gaming laptop also. - [Jono] Better than Razer? - Everything's better than Razer. This thing's... (laughter in background) This thing's professionally certified. It's not gonna blow up. (laughs) (laughter in background) Speaking of better than Razer, let's try out the keyboard. (laughs) (keys tapping) This is an interesting keyboard. I think I'll be really fast on it, but it is going to take a little bit of getting used to. It's got way more snap than what I'm used to on a laptop. It also has quite a bit of travel. It feels like, really good. This is like Blue switches if they were in a laptop. The track pad, also, is exceptional. It's not quite as big as I'd like. I personally prefer having, you know, the speakers along the sides, and then keyboard moved up, more space for the track pad, more space for your palms, not that that's an issue here. That said, this is more than large enough for what you're going to be doing, though... Um, here we go. I'm gonna say it. Just, Valheim's a fantastic game. Okay. We're getting like, 18 FPS in here. That's not really 3070 performance. Yeah, I need to do a bit more investigating. It seems like that this isn't as fast as it should be. I feel like I should be getting more like 40 FPS, given what's going on, and actually, as I say that, I started getting 40 FPS. But... It's mostly below 30, which is like, not great. Now that I'm moving out of the forest, it is increasing, because like, my house is stupid. Yeah, now I'm up to like 90 FPS. Will it tell me what the GPU temperature is? 69 degrees. Nice. Um, the fans have a really interesting sound. It's um... It doesn't really sound like a laptop if I'm honest. It sounds kind of more like the fan in your bathroom. It's more of like... A low whoosh, as opposed to the normal whine of a laptop. One thing to also note is that this isn't HP's most performance orientated ZBook. So, they do have another one that's... It's a bit chonkier, but I'm a lot more confident that it can cool a 3080 than this guy right here. This is more of the like, middle of the road, you know... It's light. This thing is legitimately quite light. It's lighter than the XPS 15 and has a freaking 3070 in it. So, that's why it's not quite what I'd expect from a gaming notebook I'm guessing. I'm in customize and buy. How much do guys think this thing is, how we have it here? - [Jono] It'll probably be under 3,000. - [Andy] 2,700. (chuckling) - [Jono] Oh, no... - Okay, so I wasn't able spec exactly what we have here. I have the 1080p one... Here. The price for this config is $4399... - [Jono] 43? - Three. (laughs) So. (chattering and yelling in background) So, $4400. Ooh. (laughs) That's rough. (laughs) - [Andy] Can I use that as my work laptop? Maybe, Andy. Uh. Hey, HP. Can Andy use this one as a daily driver? He wants it. You're not buying this laptop. You are taking this laptop, and getting your company to buy it for you, if you are so fortunate as to be able to do that. (laughs) But, anyway, I've seen enough of in here. We are, without a doubt, doing a full Ltt review on this, so we'll look more at the performance then... But, I wanna take a gander inside. Alright, I'm excited to have a look in here, 'cause I imagine it is great. Wow, there's not a whole lot you can see from the get go. So, right here, we've got an 83 watt hour battery, HP claims that you can get 20 hours of battery life with it, which I am taking with a grain of salt, but you probably can get like, 10 hours of battery life with it, which given the power of this thing, is exceptional. Now, as for the cooling system, you actually can't see a whole lot of what's on the go here. It's basically just one massive vapor chamber, so all... Of right here is just vapor chamber. That's what allows them to pack so much power into something that's... Well, this thick. So, it looks like you can upgrade your storage. So, here's our wonderful two terabyte SSD, and... I think that's about it. It appears that our RAM is soldered on, or at least very not accessible. It looks like even our WiFi card is directly soldered on. You can't even swap out that. So, yeah. For upgrade ability, you get storage and that's it. On a laptop like this, I would really like to be able to swap out the RAM. That said, this thing is so freaking cool. This is, maybe, one of the best laptops that I have seen this year. And, I can't wait to check out the 120Hz model on Ltt, and really put it through its paces. So, yeah. If you're interested in picking one of these guys up, take a look down below. Well, if you're interested in expensing one of these, take a look down below. And, just have a fantastical day. Hit like, and subscribe, and so long. - [Andy] And, we love you! (laughs) - Yes, and Andy loves you, HP.",

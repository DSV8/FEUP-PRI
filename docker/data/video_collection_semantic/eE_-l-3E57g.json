    "transcript": "- Whoa! Jesus! (glass shatter sfx) I like how that box is so light it basically like floated itself onto the desk. Is this one of those things I've seen on Instagram where it's like those lenticular, like, pieces of plastic? - [Matt] Missouri boy over here with the $20 words! - [Alex] Why do you have these discussions before you open the box? - Because, here's the thing. I'll let you in on a little secret from Mystery Tech. The items are always lame. It's the banter you come for. (island fail music) Wow! (epic reveal music) It's so clear I can't even see it! It's so clear, it's - - [Ken] We should've got him a green cloak. (glass shatter sfx) - [Matt] See? Sounds an awful lot like something fell out of there! - Oh my god. (laughter) You just took it out of the box to make fun of me, didn't you? - [Ken] Yeah. - All right, is everyone ready to find me to be invisible? Can you see me? - [Matt] Okay first off, you're holding it the wrong way. - Oh, sorry. Is that better? - [Matt] Nope. You're vaguely, your head... - No, you know what? It's a distance thing, it's a distance thing. So literally stand - like... - Ooh! - There we go, look at - oh look at... - [Austin] Ooh-ho! - [Matt] Yo! Yo! - Austin come out, come out. (audience applause) Yeah! - [Matt] It's working! - [Austin] Okay! - \"We appreciate your order and your review. \"I was able to hide from my wife and kids with this.\" So if you just do this, he'll disappear. I'm made of plastic It's fantastic - Rage! (glass shatter sfx) - [Austin] It's got this weird like suction to the table. - [Matt] It looks like wet. - [Austin] Yeah! I don't know why we're so enamored by this. - [Alex] 'Cause it's magic! - Hello! It's me! - [Alex] Yeah. That's great! - But if I get closer I start appearing, right? Hi! - [Matt] Like you're just like kind of like a smudge. - Excuse you! - [Ken] Wait, actually? I think it works best with like - - I'm behind here! - [Matt] Wait, wait, wait, wait! He's gone! - [Austin] I'm actually still here! - [Ken] It almost looks like we're censoring the fact that you're not wearing any clothes right now. - [Matt] Yeah. - What? It looks like you're holding a weird mirror. Anyway! Invisibility cloaks! They exist I guess. I just want that to be foldable so I can like throw it on myself and sneak through the library in the restricted section. Invisibility! I'm just saying like if you had like any type of vague color. Other than black on. Okay, okay! - [Alex] Oh my god, no! - [Everyone] No, no no no, no. - But this is fun! See? Is that better? - Can you please go tanning? - Ahh! - [Matt] Okay. - He can't get married now. (heavy thud sfx) - That's heavy! That was a little bit of a thud! I have nothing to go on except this is a quite heavy box. - [Alex] Good! Stop trying to guess things before you open them. - Everyone loves Mystery Tech when I don't open the tech. - [Matt] We literally cut every one of those segments out. (fail horn sfx) - Aww. (wet fart sfx) - [Ken] What is that? - [Austin] It's an Ayaneo! - [Ken] Oh mother (duck quack sfx). - So Ayaneo have made a lot of handheld gaming devices. Now some of these have been good. In fact, Ayaneo were kind of doing the whole like ROG Ally thing before ROG were. The problems are that first of all, they come up with a new one every like two minutes. And the last time we took a look at one, it was a supposedly like $300 Steam Deck sort of competitor. And the experience on it was, put simply, awful. Wow, that's a lot of Ayaneo stickers. That's so many stickers. More stuff. (glass shatter sfx) Did we pre-order this? Like why did it come with so many things? - [Matt] We sure... Maybe. - The Ayaneo Retro Mini PC. This is not a handheld. This is a mini PC that's... Retro? It is powered by a Ryzen 3 3200U. Wait. What? (laughter) Wait, I thought this was a screen. It's actually just a PC that's meant to sit like that. You can't even set the computer like that. 'Cause you're blocking your ports on the bottom. You gotta lay it like that. We have a rainbow square. You know, the famous rainbow square. What's the, like, sales pitch? Like are they really just trying to pretend like this is like a great retro gaming PC, or... - [Alex] There are other versions of that. We got the base version. - [Austin] Okay, so this is the cheap version. Got it. - [Alex] This was an Indiegogo thing, so by the time that that fulfilled and everything, and they sent it over, it's been a few months. There is another Indiegogo now. - [Austin] Yep! - [Alex] And I will say that this next version does have a touchscreen. - Really? Hello! Wow, our CPU is 100% pegged. So you're gonna play a bunch of like emulators from like, I would guess like maybe like Dolphin and earlier you're probably okay. Now importantly, you do have 16 gigs of RAM which I will give them props, that actually is a really nice amount of RAM. This is, honestly, probably like $200 worth of hardware. - [Alex] You can buy this retail for 200. We did an early bird for 150, so. - Oh wait, oh! Oh, this is dramatically better than I thought. Oh, okay. Considering we bought this for $150, I'm actually kinda about it. I wanna be clear. You're not gonna wanna do a lot. Like yes, this will technically play a lot of modern games, but like not well at all. You'll have to turn settings all the way down. You know what? I was gonna be very very negative and complain a lot, but now that I know it's so cheap, I'm actually pretty okay with it. This is actually kinda cool. - [Alex] And they gave you like $30 worth of merch. - Okay, well - - [Matt] Yeah, think of the stickers. - I don't have - - [Matt] Think of Joanna's happiness. - [Austin] I saw the stickers for five seconds and they were just stolen immediately. - It's just priceless. Okay! Okay! - [Austin] Wow! - [Matt] Why you gotta censor me? - [Ken] You just improved that framing by a lot. - Ayaneo! Imagine that! A whole little mini PC. Incredible. Why is that so warm? Ew! Touch Me! Uh-oh. - [Ken] Oh! I'mma be real, this thing looks like it came from Temu. - [Austin] Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Oh no! That's a lot of things. So we've got ourselves a PCB with what looks like some contacts here, a chip. So it's got a bunch of musical notes, so we've got C-D-E-F-G-A-B. \"This is our homage to Memphis Group. \"A design architectural group founded by Ettore Sottsass.\" There's a sticker. It's like the famous like finger touching sticker. You know. - [Ken] The what? - [Austin] The finger toucher. - And the Lord uwu'd Adam into creation. - There's no instructions. No? - [Matt] Are you sure about that? - [Alex] Nope, nope, nope, nope. That goes into a computer. - Oh no! Okay, all right. I've been instructed to go to synth.playtronica.com. Open up Dotpoiano. It's gonna load. Am I about to listen to what a plant sounds like? - [Matt] Sure are! (jungle noises) (lion roars) - Okay, so I'm gonna clamp this. - [Ken] No! Oh my god. - [Austin] Through this, guys? - [Alex] Through the holes! - Okay, so I'm gonna clamp this side. No, I think I'm gonna like just gently caress it. Wait wait, I got something, I got something. (piano melody) - So I'm gonna put a water cup here and a water cup here. - [Ken] Also kids, just in case you weren't aware, this is also how you jump a car. - Everyone ready to hear what water sounds like? (cricket chirp sfx) - [Alex] That do anything? - All right, I gotta do the thing. I just gotta... (piano melody) - [Ken] No! - [Alex] Try it on a screwdriver. Somebody tried it on a screwdriver before. (buzzing melody) - [Austin] Whoa! Ah! (buzzing melody) (Alex laughs) - But do we differ? - Okay, you go ahead. What does your soul sound like? (buzzing melody) - [Alex] It kinda does sound different. - [Austin] Matt, what do you sound like? Let us know. (buzzing melody) - Yours is so sad. (buzzing melody) - Oh! Wait! (buzzing melody) Ooh, oh, I got something here. (piano melody) - [Matt] This is a dumb futuristic instrument from Star Trek. - Yeah. - [Alex] Pretty much. - Beam me up, Scotty! (laughs) I'm sorry, wrong version of Star Trek. I'm sorry. - [Ken] Force be with you? - No! No, Ken! - Stop quoting Gandalf! (Austin laughs) - Uh-oh. Oh god! So we got ourselves not one, but two mysterious boxes. They're different, but the same. Much like we all are different and yet the same. You know that you share 90% of your DNA with a banana? What? Controllers? CRKD. Crooked. Did they send this, or did you just buy every color? - [Ken] They sent it to us. - [Matt] They sent us everything. - I will say the Classic Clear Edition looks cool. And there's also the Blossom Edition. So I'll say that the thumbsticks feel pretty nice. The D-pad's all right as well as the face buttons. And it's got very deep shoulder buttons. It does have a headphone jack on the bottom as well as USB-C on the top. What's the claim to fame here besides just a nice controller? - [Kinsey] It is 50 bucks. - Why don't y'all take a look at this. I'm gonna open up another one and see. I'm a little sus on $50. I'm not gonna lie. I'm not sure that that's the move. - Those analog sticks feel nice. - This might be a little nitpicky. 50 feels like a little too much. - It doesn't feel as premium as like an Elite 2 or the DualSense Edge. So like it has the remappable. (glass shatter sfx) - It's like something's missing. It's almost there. Obviously I'm not like fired up, but just. I think 'cause I try so many controllers from Temu and whatnot, this doesn't feel that different. It's a little nicer, but like there's a lot of controllers I've bought for like 12 bucks that feel kinda similar. Hold on a second. That's, uh, that's! - [Ken] That little sakura one. - I will say I'm not a massive fan of controllers that have like, you know, like the little control attachments for your phone like the Backbones and Razors and whatnot just because I feel like it's not super ergonomic. And it's really difficult to kinda carry. So I actually am a fan of having a dedicated separate controller and just set your phone wherever, or your tablet or whatnot. What is in this box? Is it 17 more of these things? Oh, oh, oh, I know this one. I think Kev Kenson did a video on this. So this is a Switch Grip, but it actually does a lot more than that. So it does have the Hall Effect Joy-Cons, but one of the main things is I think this is the version that has an actual HDMI on it. Hang on, I'm seeing something I don't like. Why does it come with an HDMI to USB-C dongle? I thought it just did HDMI directly out. You need the dongle? Oh that's less cool. So you just slot your Switch in like this. It clicks into the USB-C. Actually it clicks in quite nicely. And then you got yourself a much more ergonomic, I will kinda say Steam Deck sort of feeling grip for your Switch. I will say I kinda like this sort of chrome-y purple, and like the smoked sort of finish. It does have a kickstand on the back which is very firm. Like holy! Now there's no battery in this I don't think. They didn't say anything about a battery, so you're not gonna get extra battery life. (deep sigh) The fact that, especially if I'm going to like a hotel or whatever, I gotta not only carry my dongle. I might also have to carry around an HDMI cable too? I will say, my Switch is definitely dead right now. So let me charge this. Yay charging! So I'll be right back after this is done charging. (bell ring sfx) So with a perilously low 6% battery, let's give this - oh my god, there's another update? I'm gonna talk about this in the theoretical 'cause I'm tired of waiting. So the good parts about this, the sticks actually do just come off, so you actually can swap them off really easily. So the kickstand is definitely a highlight. The fact that it is so firm. You can really put it in any direction you want all the way up and down. But my big question about this that's really gonna determine is the price, right? Like how much are they charging for the Nitro Deck? - [Kinsey] So the black version without carrying case is currently on sale for 50. - I actually, you know what? I'll give this a thumbs up for 50 bucks. It actually feels pretty solid. Yeah. I just wish they would've put a full-sized HDMI on it. That's the only thing that I feel like I'm missing here. - [Matt] Okay. - You know what? That was a little bit more dramatic than it needed to be. Welcome, my friends, to Piano Gloves! \"Each fingertip plays a different note.\" Same. Watch this. (bones cracking sfx) So eight different musical instrument tones. You can demo with six prerecorded songs such as \"Row Row Row Your Boat\" and \"You Are My Sunshine\". - [Joanna] Sick! - Those are some of my favorites. So I tried an app called Piano Vision on the Meta Quest 3. And it was cool because you could actually use a real piano, and it would basically give you like Guitar Hero style vibes with it so you actually see the keys coming down. It was really fun! This is probably gonna be a lot less fun, but probably a lot goofier. Let's see how the Piano Gloves work. So I'm gonna turn it on. (piano notes ringing) - [Alex] Oh my god, that's... - [Ken] Wait, wait, I like how clever this is though. Okay, so - (piano notes) - [Alex] Oh my god. - [Ken] So. (erratic piano notes) - Go ahead. - [Ken] Matt. - This is the sound of me putting my gloves on. - Why are you yelling at me? - Do something! Get him to stop! (piano notes get louder) So if you've never learned piano before, right hand is treble clef. Left hand is base clef. And so all the notes on the right side are higher. All the notes on the left side are lower. - I feel like I'm like some (duck quack sfx) member of the Blue Man Group or something right now. - The White Man Group? (laughter) (off-key piano notes) It's almost Ode to Joy. I'm having the worst stroke watching you right now. Okay. - Oh wait, hang on dude. My gloves aren't on fully straight. I think that's actually kinda part of it. - [Matt] Okay, try going one finger at a time. Or just keep doing all the notes. Okay. Palms base. - [Ken] And then fingers. - [Alex] This is the worst recital I've ever been to. - [Matt] This is painful to watch. (piano notes) - Oh no! I'm low health! I need a potion quick! - I'm just gonna do this for you. I'm gonna hit demo. (\"Oh Susanna\" melody) - [Matt] Damn, you got so much better! (off-key notes added in) (laughter) - You can't turn it off! Mystery tech The show, the show, it is for me - [Austin] All right, show me what you got! - [Alex] Oh no, I thought we were done. (piano notes) (loud slap sfx) - How much was this? - [Alex] $32. - Oh Jesus Christ, that's $31 too expensive. - Yeah. Okay, this is going in the garbage where no one can try it ever again. - This seems like something that your aunt, your great aunt who you see once a year at Thanksgiving and always has something a little bit sus to say, but you don't really wanna get into it 'cause it's gonna extend the conversation would get you as a Christmas gift every third year when she remembers to send you something. Thanks! Aunt Bertha. - [Matt] You still like music? - (whispers) This is the part where you throw a box my way. And then I unbox it. And I go. Mystery! Tech! This is getting awkward. I'm gonna have to start begging people to like, follow, subscribe, and ring ring the ding-a-ling soon if you don't give me a box. Otherwise, I'm gonna do an interpretive dance of my life story. (loud moan) (glass shatter sfx) - Oh boy, that almost went poorly. - [Alex] All right, so you've been making a lot of noise. This item might help. - Ombra Soundproof Mask. Long time Mystery Tech viewers will remember. There are a couple of unique masks that we have tried over the years. This is I guess the next in the line of Austin's questionable mystery decisions. \"Because whispering is not an option.\" \"Because playing in silence is no fun.\" What the hell? Is this like keeping someone quiet in your trunk of your car? Is this more like - - [Matt] Why is that the first thing you went to? - \"Because playing in silence is no fun.\" What's with the whole playing thing? Is this meant for like gamers who are screaming obscenities? Uh-oh! - Oh god. - Oh no! (laughter) - [Matt] I feel like we're not wearing enough leather for this segment. - No, I actually agree. Oh! No, no no no no. No no no! No no no no no! Okay. (nonsense babbling) Oh good lord, is this the mic? It's got a headphone jack on it. Okay. So we've got aux, so a microphone/headphone splitter. Oh, here are the straps. Okay, well. - [Ken] (accent) The straps, tell me about the straps. - \"Inspired by the pure love for video gaming, \"Metadox presents The Ombra, a comfortable \"easy to breathe through voice dampening mask. \"Allows you to play games anywhere, anytime.\" I understand the idea that you don't want to shout and yell when you're choking again in League, but I don't know that this is gonna be a better solution. - [Ken] My dignity would say I'm just gonna use text. - Okay! Stop! Okay! - [Austin] What's the safe word, Matt? I need a safe word. - [Alex] Shouldn't you pick the safe word? - This is too - oh! - [Alex] Oh. Oh that immediately started working. - You know, here's the problem. It just keeps covering my nose which means I can't breathe. (muffled scream) How do I sound right now? - [Ken] Wow. - [Alex] Very muffled. - [Matt] The best I've ever heard you sound. - Cool. Okay. This is now a test (audio drop) using the microphone. (audio dropping in and out) This is now a test - - Oh geez. - Oh my god. - Using the microphone. - [Matt] That sounds just like the (duck quack sfx) in a Call of Duty lobby. - Okay, so I'm gonna try to whisper. So I'm just curious. Can you guys hear anything I'm saying right now? - [Matt] Barely. - I'm gonna (audio drops in and out). This is what it sounds like without the mask! And now (audio drops in and out) - [Alex] Yeah, okay. So it's just insane peaking. (laughter) - [Ken] It sounds like you're getting shot. - What do I have to say about this mask? I think it's probably better if you plug it into something that has better audio capabilities. But I guess it kinda works. I just question how much you need this in your life. - [Alex] Well how much would you pay for something like this? - $80. - [Alex] Oh, I'm sorry. (laughter) - [Matt] At least we won't be able to hear him yelling at us. - [Alex] It was $139. (Austin screams) (loud explosion sfx)",

    "transcript": "this is my gaming system and it's really stupid there's nothing wrong with the performance it's a beast but it draws over 500 watts from the wall wall gaming which in winter is great it's like a two for one you get a heater and a gaming system at the same time but it's very much not winter right now and at the moment it feels like I'm gaming next to the surface of the Sun this thing has a considerable impact on the ambient temperature of my apartment while gaming and that's just unacceptable so in today's video I'm gonna see if I can build this system with similar-ish performance that draws way less power but first today's video is sponsored by the monolithic dark Power Pro 13 a power supply designed to outlive you which I guess depending on your diet may not mean much but anyway honestly the only thing you really need to know about the darkroc Pro 13 is that the switch on the back brings me to orgasm without fail oh so if you're in the market for an heirloom power supply with huge amounts of future proof connectors braided cables except for the pcie51 and a bunch of awesome accessories check out the dark Rock Pro 13. with the link in the video description [Music] thank you first let me walk you through the specs of the system when it comes to the graphics card I've got an RTX 3080 in here a real Beast of a graphics card but I'm convinced it utilizes fission in the process of rendering frames considering how much heat the thing dumps into a room it has an official TDP of 320 Watts but it feels more like 800. the thing is the graphics card isn't the only problem in here in terms of CPU I've got an I9 11900k you know that CPU everyone was real pissed about when it came out well I have one of those in this system and while gaming it pulls 150 watts which I feel like is way too much for an 8 core 16 thread CPU especially one that isn't overclocked that's just what it does when left to its own devices now the rest of the stuff in here is just a bunch of PC crap they're not nearly as responsible as the CPU and the graphics card for setting my apartment on fire in the summer now my goal for this video is to build a new system that has about as much much gaming performances this system at 1440p which is the resolution I game at but while drawing significantly less power and once I'm done building that system I'll test what impact both the systems have on the ambient temperature of a room they're gaming in but before we get to the testing let's build the system [Music] now when it comes to the CPU I decided to go with this ryzen 7 5700x because there's a bunch of charts online showing that this is one of the more efficient 8 core CPUs you can get and you can get one for a couple pennies and a Brisk fondle these days okay ah good old am4 [Music] now as you could probably tell from the ITX motherboard I am building an ITX system but luckily the ITX case that I'm using supports a 240mm radiator so I'm going to use this NZXT Kraken 240 that NZXT sent over a while ago [Music] thank you now I'm going to be honest I have no idea how the motherboard mounts in relation to the radiator in the case so we may have to reorient this but we'll see and I think on that note let's get the case out now I'm using a meshalicious because well I've been using it as a light stand for the last year and a half and I thought yeah I may as well wow I feel like meshalicious is an appropriate name for what's going on here oh okay I actually think I mounted the AIO the right way around because the motherboard is going to go in here and then we can route the tubing down to the radiator over here I think it should work let's give it a try [Music] I've done a test fit and I'm pretty sure that our best bet is for the radiator to go in like this and we just kind of need to squeeze tubing out the way for the power supply to go in but luckily uh this AIO tubing is quite flexible so yeah I think we'll be okay [Music] thank you okay so now that we have a semblance of cable management in here which feels a bit weird to say considering how it looks but it's a mini ITX system there's really only so much you can do actually before we drop the graphics card in here I do want to see if the side panel fits on it requires a little bit of finangling but we're good and then in terms of graphics card I'm going to drop in this pretty losery coolered version of the RTX 4070 now say what you will about the 4070 and there's a lot you can say about it but from what I've seen online it seems to perform similarly to a 3080 but has a TDP of 200 Watts which is a pretty crazy efficiency and hopefully we can also under Vault it and stuff I'm I'm curious to see how this goes now as you can tell the mesh if I can support a whole lot more girth and a bigger cooler would be better but this is what I had lying around because you know terrible Amazon pre-built and all that foreign [Music] yeah I'd say that looks fine I don't think anything's sticking in any fans and um yeah let's fire it up [Music] well it's way smaller so that means it has to use less power right okay so we finally got our pretty much worst case gaming power draw scenario going here Battlefield 5 with 1440p high settings and the system's drawing way less power we're hovering at around 310 ish Watts from the wall down from over 550 that's pretty huge and here's the real kicker the performance between these two systems at 1440p high settings is pretty much identical in Battlefield 5. that's pretty cool so with my goal pretty much accomplished I decided to see what this power draw difference meant for impact on ambient temperature so I cooled my 760 cubic foot room down to 20.5 degrees Celsius measuring the temperature using a thermometer on the opposite end of the desk I then turned all the lights and AC off and then gamed for 40 minutes after which I recorded the temperature change so it's been 40 minutes of Battlefield 5. I just put the lights back on and I can definitely feel the temperature change and as you can see here we've gone up from 20.5 to 23 degrees Celsius I then fired up the original system following the same procedure and the results were fascinating so it's been 40 minutes now with the toaster oven system and we've hit 24.8 degrees Celsius up from 20.5 and that's just up to 40 minutes I then spent another 20 minutes benchmarking off and on and the room hit 26 degrees Celsius that's in just under an hour worth of Gaming [Music] I started by undervolting the graphics card where with just a couple of clicks managed to drop the power draw to 280 Watts from the wall down from about 310 and I didn't even lose any performance if anything the system was running better the efficiency here is super impressive in terms of CPU I played around with the voltages a bit which didn't do much but then I found the Eco button which dropped the power drill from the wall to just over 260 Watts while still giving us the same gaming performance so it's just a teeny bit of tinkering I got a significant reduction in power draw bringing us to less than half the power draw of the original system with no performance penalty and with that hopefully this new system won't set my apartment on fire while gaming anymore I'm really excited if you enjoy this kind of content let me know in the comment section down below and subscribe to the channel and until the next video bye-bye [Music] thank you [Music]",

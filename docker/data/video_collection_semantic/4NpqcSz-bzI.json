    "transcript": "now I didn't just assemble you all here today to show off my hairdresser's most recent terrible mistake I actually have some other problems I need to solve namely in regards to this 100 plus terabyte Nas I built in a recent video which after I built it I immediately ran into some massive networking bottleneck in fact according to this data transfer calculator the process is going to take 6 and a half days and today I'm going to try and solve that problem with some of the cheapest 10 gbit networking I could find and I also need to just generally deal with some of the networking issues in this office because I've just been ignoring them slowly since I moved in kind of like global warming so um yeah let's let's address some of that [Music] today now the only couple things that have changed since I did the video where I built the nas was I got one of these Ikea cxes to put it on which is some real professional server grade Furniture the building of which went very well yeah I'd say that whole looks cable and I've also added this WiFi 7 TP Link router which is mainly for VR purposes but it's been fine yeah it's it's worked the main problem has been because of the absurd amount of data that I need to move between this Nas and my editing system my gigabit Network infrastructure is really struggling to keep up with it oops so what I ended up doing was buy some of the cheapest 10 GB Network infrastructure I could find I think it's a really good idea I'm sure a brand like LM LM LM spum I'm sure a brand like LM spum is well-renowned in the networking industry but before I install all of this stuff and see how that goes there is a bit of a general networking issue I need to deal with within the office first now there were some pre-installed land cables which you can see kind of runs along the walls here and it's sometimes in tubes which also carries power you can see these are how the outlets kind of run around the walls and then the cat 6 cables terminate like this at various points along the wall which is very useful infrastructure to just find pre-installed in a new space but there's a little bit of an issue with it this is what the Nexus of all of these cables look like who whoever used this space before just cut off whatever bit of thing it was they used to terminate the ends of all of these cables and because the routed cables have been castrated what I've been doing in the meantime is just run my own land cables along the floor next to them like some kind of animal but luckily all I have to do now to rectify my savagery is terminate these cables myself and there are two potential ways I can go about that now option number one which was suggested by the person who came and installed our internet here which is actually a viewer of the channel hello Colin uh but he suggested that we use like a patch panel to terminate all of those cables and he was actually kind enough to even give me a patch panel panel uh to terminate all of these cables with which seems real professional you can see that you kind of terminate the cables on here and this definitely seems like the kind of thing used by somebody that knows what they're doing the thing is though because I'm going to have all of my network switches and stuff right here I don't want to have to run another bunch of landan cables from here straight into the network switch that feels a little bit wasteful to me so what I'm going to do instead is terminate those cables and plug them straight into the network switch which makes sense to me I feel like that should be fine and that way I have to terminate slightly fewer cables I guess I don't know we we'll see how it turns out now to do this I bought an RJ45 crimp tool which not only comes with the tool but a whole bunch of connectors as well so pretty much everything I need wow this looks like a thing I'm not qualified to use okay so this is starting to feel a bit more real now that I'm actually looking at all of these cables the first thing I did was UNC conjoin the clump of cables separating out the cables going to the two halves of the office this was in an attempt to make it slightly easier for me to trace what goes where but in the process I made two very important discoveries okay so I followed the cables along the wall and the white one I shouldn't worry about because it goes into the office next door and I don't really want to connect them to my network oh but they're numbered so this is this is is 8 76 oh so this may actually not be that difficult to do oh these are also numbered yay okay that's very good then came step two figuring out how to make RJ45 happen which I decided to just figure out on the job look like [Music] that wow stripping cables is so much easier when you're not just using a knife next I'm not sure if I need to strip the inner cables or not so uh let's give it a try and see how easy that is to do a few moments later very difficult is the answer okay so I'm just going to give it a try without stripping it and see what happens okay so there there is a little plastic core which doesn't need to be attached to the connector so I'm going to cut that off there are like a lot of different diagrams here and all of them use use naming schemes that I don't recognize well I mean I know what RJ45 is I then tried to match the colors of the cables I had to the ones on the diagram eventually just gave up and chose the bottom diagram for some reason I got to like straighten them out this goes into the cut bit for some reason so orange went on or like orange stripy no don't fall out okay like surely this is something a robot can do solid blue wasn't cooperating for a while there but it's come around I then spent ages struggling to get little cables through little holes with the occasional screw up oh oh that one's not in the correct spot oh they're in the wrong holes but I got there eventually yay oh no I forgot to record the first [__] but um I mean either way that looks like a land cable to me so let's plug it in and test it so I figured out where eight goes and it's reasonably useful but it's by all my camera crap why do laptops even have batteries they're always dead hey it actually worked first try even so I'm clearly some kind of land cable making Prodigy all I had to do now is repeat this process like five more times stripping rubbing squeezing and cutting at nauseum but eventually with my fingers tired and dehydrated I had a functional Network so now that we've sorted out all of our cables it's time to selectively upgrade to 10 gbit m now considering that we have a bunch of cat 6 cables about the place which does technically support 10 gbit ethernet I could go that route but it's not cheap enough a much cheaper option is going with fiber optic 10 gbit these two LM spum SFP cards for example only cost me $5 58 Canadian dollar each and besides fiber optic is always cooler and asign from cost I also went with the LM spum because it's got an Intel chipset in it which means it should have good support so let's open it up and have a look oh yeah there it is what a beauty we've got quite the heat sink on it and then this is our fiber optic 10 GB ethernet connector and as you can tell it's it's quite a chunky connector because there's there's a lot of connector that needs to go into it there's dacks and all kinds of stuff that needs to happen there but I'm hoping this should be a fine solution so I got two of them because well I need one in my editing system and then one for the actual Nas so that they can communicate between each other at super high speeds but I'm not going to connect them straight to each other because I still want the nas connected to the rest of my network so I decided to go with a trend net six Port multi- gig switch because again it was very inexpensive and this switch has two of our 10 GB connectors and then it's got four standard ethernet connectors which I think support up to 2.5 GB and there it is it looks like a network switch uh so with that I'm going to drop these cards into the systems and take it from there now first thing I am going to have to move the gt710 down into the slot where the uh the gigabit network card is in because well we need a fullsize PCI Express slot for the 10 GB network [Music] card oh that is super annoying because of the orientation of the power connector on the wall wart it's real Annoying to implement on a power strip you're either going to have it take off up a whole bunch of ports or you have to have it at the end hanging over so I'm going to use that to connect it to the Wi-Fi router and then this one M cable is going to go between the uh the switch and the nas wao these are such serious connectors look at that you've even got some DAC modules in there oh yeah that's a nice connector and then this 3M cable is hopefully long enough to reach my PC I I hope [Music] okay oh please be long enough oh it's so close that is that is tragic what in the world okay um I guess I'm just going to have to Route it not behind the sound panels wow that is just about long enough so now comes the moment of truth power up this system a few moments later okay um that's not a great start but all I had to do is replug in my old ethernet and download some drivers for the card yay success look at that okay well now I need to see if I can find the nas on the network I found it immediately the LM spum was plug andplay with the Nas and copying files from my PC to the nas went from this to [Music] this wao that's so fast now this is straight from this system onto the nas I'm not using the the like toaster hard drive thing which I'm sure will be a lot slower cuz that's going to be the bottleneck but still that is a lot faster than I was expecting and that kind of use case is how I'm normally going to use it but let's drop a toaster Drive in there and see what that does it's basically exactly the same speed I mean it's a little bit faster it's gone from hovering between 100 and 110 to hovering between 110 and 130 so um yeah I guess the hard drive cadd is a huge bottleneck although I potentially have a way around it so I'm going to cancel this so what I'm going to do here which isn't super ghetto at all but I'm just going to plug the drive in like this I feel like we should put the drive flat on the ground so that it doesn't fall over mid transfer okay well the plot thickens apparently the drive is the issue and not and not the the toaster oven so when it comes to initially copying the uh the like archive footage onto the nas I'm going to have to spend the rest of my life waiting for that to happen unfortunately but then something interesting happened it started copying faster wait a minute I've left it for a bit and it's like it's spun up its warp drive or something but look at that it's almost twice as fast now it does drop back down to about a 100ish every now and then but that's significantly better wow I'm so much more excited about this now although I was already pretty excited but yay even the archiving is going to take a little bit faster which is good because I did put this off for like 3 weeks so it could have been done three times over by now but still now it's going to happen faster which means it's better that's a way to end a video [Music]",

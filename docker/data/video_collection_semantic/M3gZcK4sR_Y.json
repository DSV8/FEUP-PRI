    "description": "AMD has launched their RX 5700XT and RX 5700 based on the Navi 10 and RDNA GPU architecture.  It looks really promising.  The prices for these cards will be $449 for the RX 5700XT and $379 for the RX 5700 which puts them up against the RTX 2070 and RTX 2060 respectively.  But will performance and framerates actually line up to make these the best new graphics cards of 2019?

    "transcript": "everyone Eber here with Hardware Canucks and I'm here in LA attending E3 and I just finished my briefings with AMD about a bunch of stuff including Zen to the you know Ryzen 3000 series processors and the upcoming navi based graphics cards now i will be covering Ryzen 3000 and a separate video because we do have a lot more information regarding the architecture and what AMD has brought to the table with the new offerings so definitely stay tuned for that but right now i think the most important announcements are the graphics cards the RX 5700 xt and the RTX 5700 which will be available to buy later this summer but will they be enough to give nvidia some competition well we now know a lot more information about these new GPUs so let's take a closer look but first a quick word from our sponsor excuse me please explain is easy to systems fully powered by a single power supply just like me and you two bodies powered by a single mind just imagine the good we can do the revolt X by fantex a high-performance unit for multi CPU GPU and dual system configurations with 80-plus platinum efficiency with entirely silent fan mode and twelve year warranty and clean cable management explore the opportunities with the revolt XPS you buy fan tax links below okay so before I get into the specs of these new GPUs I think it's important to understand the underlying architecture of these new GPUs and that's Radeon DNA or RDNA and for those of you are wondering it's based off a brand new 7 nanometre manufacturing process the name RDNA actually gives a good hint at how AMD's approaching this generation of graphics cards so instead of being the jack-of-all-trades which are great for everything from deep learning algorithms to gaming there's you know focus laser focus on just gaming this time meanwhile the Vega architecture will stick around for you know high-performance computing tasks and machine learning algorithms basically RDNA is meant as a solution for an entire product stack that will include you know everything from graphics processors to pcs or smartphones to notebooks to consoles and a lot more so the first thing that AMD went about doing is optimizing power consumption versus performance you see valve a did provide relatively good frame rates it was super power-hungry and it produced a lot of heat of course the seven nanometer manufacturing process helps with overall efficiency but there's some extra special sauce added to RDNA as well so there's reduced latency across the entire core which increases bandwidth for better use of resources and pipeline optimizations which generate pretty big performance per clock improvements those will eventually lead to each chip providing better performance than Vega but at lower power needs when all of these items are combined things start to look pretty impressive AMD has also designed a new computer unit which theoretically doubles the instruction rate since two of those CEOs can be combined to work on the same task in parallel within each compute unit are 64 stream processors that means a full Navi 10 GPU with 40 compute units will have 25 60 cores which is much lower than the 4096 found on the Vegas 64 so what is that result in well from an apples-to-apples comparison RDNA and the Navi architecture will have a 25% improvement over Vega when compared at the same core layout and clock speeds meanwhile the full Navi 10 GPU found on these new cards will have about 14% better performance than Vega 64 while consuming much less power that's actually pretty interesting since Vega has a lot more compute units than Navi 10 but maybe the most amazing thing is how small the Navi 10 GPU actually is instead of it being 495 square millimeters it's just 251 which is really really impressive so now let's get on to the actual specs of these cards and yes there will be two of them let's start at the top with the RX 5700 XT which uses the full Navi 10 core it has 2560 stream processors and operates with a base frequency of 1605 megahertz and a game clock of 1755 megahertz now the game clock is basically what aim D expects will be achieved while gaming while the boost speed of 1905 megahertz now seems to be a target that very fruit applications will hit there's also 8 gigabytes of gddr5 a DP lluvia a 256 bit interface that hey 14 gigabits per second of raw speed meanwhile it has 256 texture units and 64 our Opie's and according to AMD it has a board power of 225 watts or about the same as an overclocked rrtx 2080 founders edition the RX 5700 uses a cut-down Navi 10 core with a slightly lower amount of stream processors compared to the XT variant and lower clonk speeds of 1465 megahertz and 1625 megahertz for the base and game frequencies other than that it has the same memory texture units and ROP layout as its bigger brother personally I think this will be a sweet spot even though it's 180 watts of power puts it even higher than the RTX 2070 and both of these cards will be launching in July so now let's take a look at the card itself and there are a couple of things that jumped on to me personally first of all it is a blower style heatsink which makes me think right away of these super loud reference AMD cards from the last 5 years or so there's also 8 plus 6 pin power inputs and connectors for DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.0 the radio team also made a big deal about the PCI 4.0 interface but they're likely won't be any practical uses for that in the foreseeable future I think it's just simply a marketing checkbox that they wanted to take now as for the overall performance honestly guys don't expect flagship frame rates here what AMD showed was a bunch of charts that tended to raise more questions than actually answering them so starting with this one which compared the rx 5700 XT to the Vega 56 and considering AMD spent most of their time talking about Vega 64 seeing Vega 56 was a bit odd but well at least it's Navi 10 with its 40 compute units that can easily up form a Vega with 56 compute units that's progress I guess moving on AMD did show some very straightforward performance numbers as well now these show that the RX 5700 XT outperforming me RTX 2070 by an average of about 6% at first glance that's good news but it also points towards the Radeon lineup slipping further behind Nvidia since they're not even close to competing against the RTX 2080 not to mention the 2080 Ti not only that but we can't again that the RX 5700 XT has a board power of 225 watts whereas the reference RTX 2070 is about a hundred and seventy-five watts and I guess that makes sense because AMD is targeting a larger market with the rx 5700 XT and the 5700 and if you think about it most people aren't really particularly interested in the higher-end GPUs like the RTX 20 80 and the 2080 TI but rather you know they'd lean towards the RTX 2060 and the 2070 and most likely the GTX 1660 TI as well personally I'd love to see more competition in that area compared to some of the extreme ends that's just my take now the RX 5700 could be the new budget King if these results are anything to go by as you can see they're supposed to be the RTX 2060 in literally every test and even though it consumes more power I'm getting more and more excited about what it can offer but what do you guys think do you think this card is for you now what about ray tracing honestly that's a question less and less people are asking and AMD is taking a pragmatic approach to it right now their implementation is simple shader based ray tracing without actual hardware acceleration but as you probably heard in yesterday's Microsoft presentation the next generation project scarlet console will include a Navi GPU and hardware based real time ray tracing acceleration when it launches in 2020 that means it will use the next generation RDNA and Navi architecture that will not only include hardware acceleration but will also leverage cloud-based resources to optimize ray tracing performance speaking of those next generation of RDNA you can expect to see RDNA to launch alongside next-generation consoles in 2020 and it'll use a refined seven nanometer process there's no word on what that will mean for the PC market but I wouldn't be surprised to see if it makes an appearance in 2021 or very late 2020 remember guys that's more than a year from now so anything could change by then so I guess it's time to wrap this up and guys what amy has shown isn't super exciting but these new cards do look like they will hit very important markets you see the RTX 2060 and the RTX 2070 don't have any competition right now so you know any alternatives will be a welcoming addition but let's get this off the table right away at this point AMD has no plans to launch a GPU that will compete against the best of what Nvidia is to offer you see they're focused with RDNA RDNA 2 and Navi is to offer you know console and smartphone manufacturers and efficient GPU architecture that will fit their needs so they'll take that design and scale it upwards to create you know entry-level to mid tier graphics cards for the PC market so while aim D claims that their focus is on PC gamers Navi's DNA is obviously rooted in the console space and I don't think that's a bad thing either so overall I think there's a lot to look forward to when these new GPUs launch sometime next month so definitely stay tuned for the reviews but in the meantime let us know your thoughts about the rx 5700 XT the 5700 Navi man it looks like every year or as generations go by the naming scheme just gets even more complicated so yeah let me know what you guys think I mean we're with horican axe thank you so much for watching make sure to check out some relevant content here subscribe to our boot sequence Channel I'm signing off and I'll see you guys in the next one",

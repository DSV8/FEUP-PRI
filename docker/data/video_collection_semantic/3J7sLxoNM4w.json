    "transcript": "(upbeat dance music) - The new Sony RX100 Mark 7 came out. And the Sony RX series has been one of my favorite lines of vlogging cameras for the longest time. But this one finally a microphone input jack. And I've been experimenting with a lot of microphones. And this is a little $25 one that I got from Amazon. So right now, I am not using any microphone, this is the onboard microphone audio. Trick to finding a microphone that works. It's been interesting because there are some that do work and there are some that don't. And what I've found is the TRS microphones work really well. And those are the ones with only one little ring right here. There's TRRS. There's all kind of different versions but if you're looking for it, make sure you're searching for TRS or you're going to have to use some sort of adapter. So now let's switch to this little guy and I'll let you see what this sounds like. But first, Jenna say something. - [Jenna] Hello, how are you doing today? - That's what Jenna sounds like. - [Jenna] I'm behind the camera. - She's behind it. - [Jenna] You're in front of the camera. - I'm in front. Okay, let's plug this in. So the microphone is now plugged in. It looks so silly because it's so small and tiny but it's perfect for, sort of, having a compact look. Because I didn't want to have any mounts. I didn't want to have anything. I just wanted to have a microphone. And so far, this one has worked and it's only 25 bucks. Jenna say something. - [Jenna] Hello, it's Jenna. I'm back here. I'm behind the camera. - But what's cool, is you could do one of these. So if Jenna's talking, I can actually go, hold on a second. - [Jenna] Hello, it's Jenna behind the camera. Or even if you're behind the camera, wow. - If I'm behind the camera, I can just flip it. - [Jenna] Look at this. Look at this. I'm still behind the camera. I'm moving further away from you. Now you say something. - Hello Jenna. Cool, now let's flip this end to it and go back over there. Turn this way. - [Jenna] I ran out of hands. - Hello, hi Jenna. - [Jenna] Hi. - Hi (animal noise) - [Jenna] Oh. - The next test I'm going to do is - This is just a long microphone. This is one of the Senheiser microphones. Again, this is the TRS input here. There's so many version of 3.5 millimeter jacks. So not all of those will work so it sometimes may be a little bit of trial and error to see what will work. This is where you look super silly. But for simple vlogging, this is incredible. And no one else can see how silly you look, well they'll see how silly you look in real life. Just not on camera. This probably isn't the microphone that I would use on a daily basis. But it's all that I had right now. So here you go Jen. Okay. Hello, testing testing. So in this one, it's only picking up one channel of audio. Ugh, ugh you can't go to far. Again, here's what it sounds like without a microphone. And now we're going to switch to this little Senheiser microphone. Jen and I shot an entire vlog like this. Like I was walking around the zoo and going to all the places and this is what I looked like. (girl singing) - [Singer] At least I look cool. I mean in real life, I look crazy. But for you guys, you got great audio. So look, see, see. Great audio. How does it sound? You can also adjust the audio levels in here as well. You go into the function and then, I have it on level 15. So basically when I was talking, I didn't want it to peak. When I was watching my video from the zoo, I realized my audio was peaking a little bit. So about 15, 16 seems really good as long as it's not going to the red. Any way, I'll be doing a full video of this, but I wanted to give you a little test of the microphone input because a lot of you guys were asking some questions. So look for that video here in the next few days and I don't know, I can't wait, maybe I'll start vlogging again. Because this makes vlogging easy. Got the flip up camera. - [Jenna] Screen - Screen. The only thing is they don't have a place to mount the microphone so you have to get creative. There's a bunch of different brackets that I got so I'll show you guys in those vlogging set ups. But for now, let's finish the seg Jen. Ready? Let's go. - [Jenna] We still going? - Yeah we still going. Look at that. Silly, silly, silly (upbeat music)",

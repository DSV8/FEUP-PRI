    "transcript": "a month ago i bought two tvs off of aliexpress and um i've only received one the second one was apparently delivered in ontario which is a bit weird considering that i live in vancouver so i don't think we're getting that one uh which means straight off the bat we've only had a 50 success rate buying tvs off of alien express but luckily we did get one of them so today we're going to open it up and see what kind of abomination we received and then i'm gonna compare it to a tv that i bought locally for about the same amount of money oh oh it's falling out but before we get into that it's time for a word from today's video sponsor lenode today's video is sponsored by lenode a company that's been awarded by me is having the best name to save just give it a try it feels good doesn't it lenode is a linux based cloud computing and web hosting service that offers multiple products to manage cloud storage websites databases game servers kubernetes and they can even handle whatever computational load you can imagine and regardless of what service you decide to go with you will get access to award winning customer support if all of this sounds good to you sign up to lenode using the link in my description below to get a 60 day 100 free credit thank you lenode for sponsoring today's video apparently the tv's all screen which is great compared to those loser no screen tvs wow these little plastic feet feel like a part of a toy that you get in a kinder egg that is that's some sturdy plastic right there oh it's so light holy crap oh it does smell like it's from aliexpress that standard industrial dumpster plastic smell it does feel a bit like it was made out of melted down bits of blockbuster but at least the zombie tv does have a vase amount on the back which is pretty nice for ports we've got two usb and a single hdmi but i do like that we still have crustacious period analog video in which makes this a good pairing for an old console now while i'm down here one of the big advantages of this tv's theater caboose is that there is quite a lot of space for uh speakers in it so maybe this tv will have decent audio let's see if that pans out it's so light oh there's a nice peel incoming i can just feel it oh the bottom lip did almost come off but still that was amazing it looks good i know what they mean about all screen now but yeah let's fire it up and see what the picture looks like and what kind of caboose sound we get from it and what kind of gaming experience it offers because that's the most important bit whoa in 2011 this tv would have been sick oh there we go hey those are some real uniformity issues but luckily i do have a spider x so we'll be able to get some real professional measurements to see how this tv really stacks up hey look at that we've got the little the little smart tv interface going let me see if i can figure out how to change it into english okay now i'm actually going to be really big brain about this i'm quickly going to see what the chinese symbol for language is and then we'll be able to find it right language looks like that oh that's it that's it so that's language so here english yes i am a genius hmm not sure i want to connect this tv to the internet but aside from that this does seem to be a perfectly usable tv which is pretty cool so let's plug a console into it and see what kind of gaming experience we get it doesn't look too bad it's relatively bright and it's crisp enough i guess for like normal sitting away from distances uh this is a 1080p display so it's not 4k but you don't need rich people nonsense like 4k at 32 inch with a tv unless you're sitting like this which then you can see that those pixels are actually pretty massive let's try the speakers yeah no never mind they're not very good there's not any obvious ghosting uh so that's actually good i'm impressed by that i was expecting there to be ghosting but the way that it renders motion isn't great it's quite blurry let's see what options we have here so picture profiles uh standard movie picture okay let's try game maybe game deals with the blurriness actually maybe a little bit maybe a little bit although i feel like we've given up the motion blur a little bit and we've replaced it with a pretty just weird looking motion rendering generally movement doesn't look great but other than that this is a surprisingly usable tv with that let's check out the best buy tv now the thing with this best buy tv is for roughly the same base price as the aliexpress tv you're getting 43 inches of viewing pleasure in 4k as opposed to 32 inches at 1080p which means things are already looking pretty grim for that aliexpress tv but then you take into account all of the shipping prices on top of it and things get wild but we'll we'll get into that later in the video let's let's have a closer look at this high sense first just now the first thing that i notice about this high sense tv is that it smells way better than the aliexpress one did and it also has analog in so that's pretty cool uh other than that it does have a whole bunch more hdmi and just generally a much better assortment of io now i'm not sure but i think the tv from best buy is a little bit bigger but in the words of my wife trying to console me every day size is not the only thing that matters so let's fire up this high sense and see how the image quality compares to the little xiaomi when setting up the high sense i noticed a couple of key differences between it and the little xiaomi the first is when it comes to picture profiles you have a lot more tinkering settings available but for the initial gaming tests i settled on just the standard picture profile and the second thing i noticed was that the high senses caboose sound is a definite step up however when i launched into alden ring i was not impressed no way is that max brightness this tv is so dim one hour later i've played around with the settings a bit in fact i think i just put the default color space back on and then switched game mode back on and now the brightness is better i've also played gears which looks way better than eldon ring on this tv and yeah at this point in this state the brightness isn't that bad it's not nearly as dull as it was earlier and it's it's usable in this room with a bunch of lights in it but if you have a living room with like a bunch of sun in it and stuff it's not going to be great because the brightness on this tv is surprisingly low even compared to the little xaomi but having said that i think now is a good point to do some measurements to see how these two tvs actually stack up oh that is a very interesting result starting with color space coverage where the high sense tv is a bit better than the xiaomi basically meaning it can show a bigger variety of colors but when we have a look at the color accuracy results the xiaomi is actually better which means the high sense tv may be able to show more colors but they're garbage colors honestly that high sense results proper poutier now moving over to brightness uniformity the result is roughly the same it's not great but it's not terrible either however when it comes to actual brightness and contrast the xiaomi is a lot better than the high sense tv it's almost twice as bright in fact which really shows the high census is a very dull tv having said that before we get into the final pricing for these two tvs where things get pretty wild let's see what anna thinks of them okay anna so what do you think on first view i think that i prefer the larger size but that's just because you know we've gotten used to large screens yeah bigger is always better is always better i mean not always the blacks between the two are very different really nothing i didn't want to do anything so like the blacks on the xiaomi are way way darker the saturation on the zombie is better and the high sense is actually quite dark for a screen or a monitor like you can see that there the difference between the colorful wood like this one's not overly bright at all but this one is quite significantly duller or dimmer than this one physically i prefer the matte legs of the high sense and the gray accents but i do also like the top bezel it kind of has a bezel-less feel of the xiaomi but i don't like the shiny black plastic so overall if these two cost the exact same which one would you get it would depend on the size of my apartment to be honest whoops um but i i don't know okay that's her okay now the base price for both of these tvs was pretty much identical it was 380 canadian dollars but that's not what you pay for stuff right you have to take into account all of the taxes and additional hidden costs with all of that taken into account the best buy tv cost a total of 450 canadian dollars whereas with the aliexpress tv initially i paid a total of 440 canadian dollars for it including shipping and stuff which is again surprisingly similar but then i got a message from the aliexpress seller on whatsapp going hey uh thank you for buying a tv it's a bit weird but i appreciate it on an unrelated note the shipping that you paid for isn't real shipping basically how it works is we put the tv on a plane and then fly it into rural british columbia at some point we then throw the tv out of the plane and then we send you the gps coordinates of the plane the moment we throw the tv out and then it's up to you to go and hike into the mountains and woods to go and find the tv but considering that the tv would have been in the woods for a while there's a good chance bears would have found it and they're most likely gonna hold it for ransom so once you find the tv you'll probably have to also pay bear ransom uh is this something you'd like to deal with no i don't want to pay bear ansem in the woods for my tv what kind of question is that and then he responded with okay well then your only option is to pay an additional 240 canadian dollars for shipping which kind of explains what happened to the other tv i guess it's just in the bear mountains somewhere but anyway that meant that the total amount that i paid for the aliexpress tv was about 640 canadian dollars which is 250 more than i paid for the best buy tv and if i paid that amount for a tv at best buy i would have been able to get a much better tv which means the basic takeaway from all of that is if you have other options don't buy a tv off of aliexpress but if you live in turkmenistan and it's your only option at least you get a serviceable tv right which is pretty cool which brings me to the end of the video thank you for watching like and subscribe to the channel if you enjoyed the video and maybe consider watching another video a suggestion will pop up in a second and yeah until the next video thank you for watching bye you",

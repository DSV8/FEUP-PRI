    "transcript": "- Hey guys, this is Justine. And today I thought I would do a little rumor video. It's been a while since I've done one of these and I don't really like to do them because it's sort of just promotes more random rumors. But it is kind of fun to go and see what people are talking about and what people think is going to be released next. And this kind of really hit home for me. This is a render of what potentially could be the new 2021 IMAX. And this was released by Jon Prosser and he's obviously has quite a track record for releasing a lot of rumors and leaks. And why this got me kind of particularly excited is because when these color IMAX were released, this was at a time where Apple was kind of struggling financially and a lot of things were up in the air and this sort of vigor-rated Apple, it's sort of got people interested again, I guess added the fun back into the company. And then these computers were wildly used in schools and you saw them everywhere and it really kind of was a game changer for Apple. And for me personally, like these colored IMAX, they do hold a very special place in my heart. So let's go and see when were these released? This was the lifespan of them were from 1998 to 2003. So this was kind of for me at a point where I was actually in high school kind of just graduating, trying to figure out what I wanted to do. And at that point in time, Apple had such a huge influence on me. I was doing book reports on Steve Jobs. I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do with the rest of my life and where my interests lie. And mostly I was very interested in graphic design and photography. So seeing the success of these IMAX and seeing them basically everywhere that I went was really, really cool. I do remember we went and got the lime iMac for my grandmother and it was kind of cool to sort of introduce her to this whole world that was something that was so near and dear to my heart and then to kind of teach her how to use it. And now my grandmother is so tech savvy like you guys don't even know, like she makes full on scrapbooks of all of my adventures, she does them all in pages, she prints them out and it's so fascinating to see how far she's come from that lime iMac. We actually did recently get her a new iMac for Christmas so she is all up to date. So I feel like the color scheme of these potential IMAX are really not that far off because these are all the colors basically of the last iPad Air and the colors of the new AirPods Pro Max which I've been loving. My AirPods Pro Max, I just recently got back from a three-week kind of COVID safe, social distancing road trip where I basically saw less people in three weeks than I saw on a single walk around my block in Los Angeles and my sister and I were doing podcasts. And my sister and I were doing podcasts basically in the back of a Chevy Tahoe and we've been using the AirPods Pro Max for our main headphone source. I edited probably 35 hours in the passenger seat of the car with them. Even in the car when we were kind of having conversations and I was editing, I actually would forget that I had them on because I would just turn the transparency mode on and I would be able to hear everything perfectly, like it's kind of weird to think about and I'd be like, wait, I have a headset on like, this is strange. But anyway, going back to these IMAX, I'm very excited because the performance of the M1 in that 13-inch MacBook Pro, I'm not gonna lie, it's basically been my main editing machine since it came out. Now, I obviously had traveled a little bit for the holidays and this past three weeks, the three week road trip was really a test for me because I pushed this thing to its limits. Now, the fact that it only does have two ports is a little bit hindering because it doesn't have enough power to power two of my four terabyte solid state drives, I'd run into a few issues with that but it's like this machine is not a pro-level machine. And the things that I have been doing on this laptop are just, it's mind blowing to me. I'm editing 8K footage, I'm editing externally. I've been powering our entire podcast. I basically have been doing everything on it and it's been performing amazing, and I have few issues that I've run into where some plugins didn't work and things weren't working properly. But I feel like that's kind of to be expected because of the whole entirely new architecture. And a lot of apps have not completely got on board with M1 yet and also Big Sur. And for me, I usually never update to the latest OS until like six to eight months later just to make sure everything works. But this year I did update to Big Sur on all of my machines. And there have been a few instances of things that haven't worked. I know a lot of people who do a lot with audio, they have not been able to use various plugins and things like that. So I think it is kind of hit or miss depending upon what you're doing but for me that M1 and being completely kind of engulfed in the Apple ecosystem editing and final cut and compressor and everything that I do. It's so powerful. I mean, it really does rival my Mac Pro back there. Now the differences though obviously with the Mac Pro, I have so much more power. I can attach so many more things to it. I have 1.5 terabytes of RAM in it. So it is kind of hard to put them kind of side-by-side in a comparison kind of in that scale but the amount of things that I've done on that Macro Pro I just, I'm so shocked. The future of these chips that Apple is creating is, I'm so here for it. Like the next whatever they release, whatever it is if it's gonna be a 16-inch MacBook Pro, I don't know, I'm so ready for it. But that's also why I'm very excited about the potential next gen desktop. So John also showed this, this is a potential render of what the new Mac Pro would be like. So I don't if you guys can see, well, you know what the Mac Pro looks like. But it's over there. It's a big boy, it's beefy, it's powerful, it's incredible. So the fact that this is saying that it is gonna be like three to four Mac minis stacked on top of each other, like that's what it's gonna look like. And it's like processing power here, heat sync up here, what's that top look like though? I wonder if it's gonna kind of look like the grill of the Mac Pro. Would be pretty cool. So who knows if it's real but either way, I think these colors do look beautiful. But what's difficult is if this is on my desk, I'm really only going to see the screen and kind of like the bottom of it. So I don't really see that much of a reason to have all the colors but I do know that I would definitely be getting the pink one. No questions asked, what is the question? What color do you want? You don't even need to freaking answer it. It's answered already. The thing that I don't like though is my only sort of complaint is this color of the AirPods Pro Max like I don't like this it's a little too orange. Like this is nice. I feel like this should have been more of like a muted kind of color 'cause it doesn't really match anything. Like it's I'm not sure. I don't it's too, it's just, it's a miss for me. That's all I'm gonna say. But like this color pink, like this is nice. Look at that, look at this. Nice, but this color pink on the iMac is probably gonna be more like this kind of a color which is nice. I like this, this I like, this is orange. This isn't even pink. This is nothing, this is not even, I don't, I just, I would love to hear from you guys though like what are you looking forward to Apple this year? Have you seen any other rumors that I should check out? I'm just very excited about the future of what the M1 chips are going to be because seeing the power and the potential, just in these lower-end Macbooks, it has me so excited for the future. I'll see you guys in my next video, feel free to leave me some comments below. Don't forget to like and subscribe and hit the bell. So you're notified when I post new videos and that's all, I'll see you guys in the next one, bye. (mellow music)",

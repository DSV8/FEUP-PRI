    "transcript": "what's up guys Eber here with Hardware Canucks and I want to make this quick video regarding Intel's upcoming 8th generation CPUs the reason why we wanted to post this video is to clear some misconceptions about these upcoming products but also explain to you guys what the difference is between 8th generation CPUs versus Kaby Lake or seventh generation products now quick disclaimer we still have no information regarding intel's upcoming Coffee Lake cpus we might share a few information here and there in this video but we just have to wait for the specs and all that kind of stuff later down the road but as of right now this video is just going to go quickly over intel's upcoming 8th generation cpus into ultrabooks and guys i have to admit the specs are really and I mean really interesting so let's dive in right after this cool master master keys keyboard line-up is now available and three sizes to fit within your space with large medium and small boards with either beautiful RGB or pure white LED illumination it will something for everyone make it yours with a master keys Pro by Cooler Master so let's have a quick refresher about what until a generation course series involves since things are pretty different this time around it used to be that each generation was tied together with specific architecture for example the seventh generation held exclusively Kaby Lake chips while the sixth generation was skylake shifting beyond the 40 nanometer manufacturing process has been proven to be a challenge so basically we now have an architecture change following optimizations on an architecture without switching processing nodes that means skylake kaby lake and other refreshes are all the same 14 nanometer manufacturing process basically Intel's a generation will include three different refreshes new Kaby Lake processors coffee lake and even cannon Lake expect to hear more information about coffee Lake in the fall and we'll be covering that architecture in depth very soon this release follows their new naming scheme while introducing a new set of Kaby Lake processors for the slim and light ultrabook range intel is calling these newer 8000 series processors kaby lake are and honestly i'm pretty excited for them but why is intel targeting ultrabooks with this refresh well the simple answer to that is the majority of consumers heavily rely on these products students professors business professionals use these devices on regular basis to get work done in fact I use this LG gram 15 every day to log benchmarks write scripts consume content and in some cases even edit videos our day 1 RX Vega coverage back in LA is a testament to that since it was all edited produced and rendered on an ultrabook that weighs a bit more than a soda can also over the past few years we've only seen a minimal improvement in terms of performance from one generation to the next in fact we did test out the ultra low voltage u series skylake vs Kaby Lake cpu's and notice roughly 9 to 15 percent increase in ROM performance so it wasn't really worth upgrading from Sky lake to Kaby Lake unless if you really needed that extended battery life because Kaby lake chips were known for having better power efficiency if you're interested in that comparison video I'll leave a link to that in the description down below so what exactly are these new a generation mobile CPU is called at least the low-end SKUs that we're discussing today well you can address them as Kaby Lake refresh or like I said Kaby Lake are because they're essentially using a refined and matured 40 nanometer manufacturing process compared to Kaby Lake there's also some minor design changes that allow for better performance per one Intel says that the new notebooks will feature CPUs based off this 14 nanometer plus technology that means a more powerful node that allows them to jam four cores onto an ultra-low voltage package without increasing its GDP versus the dual core seven generation processors basically these new i7 and i5 series CPUs will have up to four cores and eight threads while boasting a TDP of around 15 watts that's really amazing since it could really enhance performance without sacrificing battery life it's like a dream come true I don't know but let's take a look at some specs just to be clear all four SKUs that we're looking at today feature four course and eight threads starting from the top we have the i7 8650 you CPU that comes with a base clock of 1.9 gigahertz and turbo boost up to 4.2 it also comes with eight megabytes of cash so that's doubled up compared to last gen however it still seems to be using the same integrated graphics except they have renamed it from HD to UHD implying these new CPUs can easily playback 4k content without breaking a sweat I'll have to test that for myself of course moving down the line we have the I7 8550 you let's collect at 1.8 gigahertz for bass and boost up to 4 gigahertz it still carries the same amount of cash from the 8650 you the i5 8350 you is clocked at a base of 1.7 gigahertz and goes all the way up to 3.6 gigahertz so the blue frequency is quite lower compared to the i7 and a cache has been reduced to 6 megabytes they still feature the UHD 620 graphics but they are 50 measures under clocked last but not least we have the i-5 8250 new CPU sporting a base clock of 1.6 gigahertz with a turbo boost after 3.4 and the rest of specs are identical to the a350 you what's even impressive is that the TDP on these new processors remain at or slightly above a 15 watts so regardless of those two additional course Intel claims up to 10 hours of battery life like everything else we'll have to validate that when we get our hands on the new ultrabooks so stay tuned for that one thing I have to mention is that Intel has achieved their excellent TDP and battery values by drastically separating the speeds achieved by single and all core performance on the desktop we're used to seeing a few hundred megahertz but in this case the Delta is several gigahertz basically int'l is prioritizing multiple threads over raw frequencies when an application determines all eight threads are needed but what about availability of the products well Intel claims it will see over 145 designs in September and coffee Lake will be coming to the desktop very soon as well we can't wait to see what Intel has to offer especially with rising putting on some pressure lately so what can we take away from this announcement from Intel well there are a few things one the specs on paper look very promising for users who are looking to upgrade to two or three or even five-year-old notebooks even our mini editor-in-chief mike AKA sky mt l has been using his five-year-old veil z as his notebook and so you know CD specs would perhaps make him upgrade to a newer notebook very soon I really don't know also remember that quad core CPUs were launched into mainstream networks ever since Intel's the second generation Core Series so it's you know it's awesome to see them finally implement those quad core chips or not those chips but quad core teacher into ultra books and I'm really excited for that this is also an excellent glimpse into what a generation desktops EPS are going to look like and I'm just gonna leave it right there so I wanna hear your thoughts on Intel's upcoming a generation you series processors are you excited for this over the desktop or even the processors getting into the mainstream notebooks this fall let us know in the comments down below i'm Eber with Hardware Canucks thank you so much for watching make sure to save subscribed to the channel for more upcoming content and we'll see you in the next one",

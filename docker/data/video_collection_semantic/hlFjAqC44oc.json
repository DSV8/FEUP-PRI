    "transcript": "- Oh wow, my Venus, my fire, my desire. no, we're not unboxing a waifu but there is a beautiful waifu on the front of it. We're unboxing Moondrop's Venus, their planar magnetic headphones from- (beep) From Moondrop, the lauded in ear monitor producing company that came onto the scene in 2015 and has continually been shaking up the IEM world at pretty much every price point by releasing lots of really, really cool headphones at really, really cheap prices. Like their $20 Moondrop CHUs, which are like, okay, they're fine but they're still $20 for what you get. It's pretty good deal. Or their Blessing2, which was a huge huge price proposition being at $330 and was competing with like $600, $700 IEMs. But now they're trying to make their transition into headphones, which is not a transition that many companies have been the most successful at. You think that it should be pretty easy. If you can make a good earbud then you can probably make a good headphone, but that's not the case. Look at Sennheiser. Sennheiser is famous for making some of the best headphones of all time and they have like one good in ear monitor. What's the deal? Well, it turns out that they're actually a lot more different than they are the same. But that didn't scare Moondrop at all because Moondrop's actually releasing three different headphones. They're releasing their lower end Moondrop Void a dynamic driver headphone. They're also gonna be releasing their high-end Moondrop Zero a electrostatic headphone and they're releasing the Venus, a planar magnetic headphone. But the question is, are these ones good today? We didn't even look at the box we didn't look at the outside of the box. Let me don't look here. Stop looking. I don't know if you can like buy these in a storefront release. So the box design's kind of interesting 'cause usually if you're gonna be shopping for expensive headphones you'll see the models out on the floor as opposed to like in their boxes. But they do always go above and beyond when it comes to putting a girl on the box. On the back, there's this cool breakdown of the actual structure of the drivers. You can see there's a diaphragm, there's frames, the staters for the magnets as well as a frequency response graph that isn't really the most easy to read or detailed, but it's cool that they're actually reporting what they've measured it on as well as their response and then they just say Target and we don't know what they're actually targeting. They could have just been like, hey this is a target that'll make our headphone look good. But it's fairly harm and shaped. The inputs to the headphones are 3.5 millimeters. I really appreciate that because that means it's easy to replace cables. The plug. So the other end of it, they have a 3.5 millimeter single-ended plug and a 4.4 millimeter balanced plug. Six hertz to 80 kilohertz. What they really mean is 20 kilohertz to 20 kilohertz and even then they probably don't go all the way down to 20 hertz. Impedance is 18 oms, which isn't the easiest to drive, but you should be fine with pretty much any audio player. You might not be able to drive them at their full volume. But I didn't have any issues driving these with basically any computer I plugged them into. I plugged them into two different computers like a laptop. I plugged them into my desktop at work. I didn't plug them into an iPhone. I think that the iPhone adapter should be able to cover 18 oms, it's not too bad. And then sensitivity one decibel. It's cool. Let's get it outta here and let's get this in. Now the Venus is competing with some fancy headphones so I'm expecting a decent unboxing experience. Not terrible. They got like some foam and some velvety material. We got QC005. I don't know if that means that we got the fifth ones. We probably didn't, we're not that special to them. For such a big box, yeah, there's nothing else in here which is a bit disappointing. I would've liked to see like maybe a carrying case or something. Maybe even just like a bag. Maybe this does this come out and makes a bag? Yo, it's the Tesla logo. Whoa, no, this just comes out I guess. Before we talk about this, what's in this? Inside we have, is it is like a tiny postcard? We got a manual, in here we have our, ooh, a nice braided, oh and they even have the the little twisties. This is very much a IEM thing, the twisty cable. I like it. I think it looks nice. So we got our... We have our 3.5 millimeter adapter and then we have our balanced output. It's also doing that braided cable thing that I think looks really nice. There's a split right here in the middle to go to the two inputs. I kind of worry about the stress relief here. There's not much in terms of strain relief kind of just goes into the plastic. I would've liked to see more rubber coming out or more silicone coming out to actually I don't know, relieve the stress. While the connector is quite large on the three and a half millimeter the stress leaf seems a little bit better especially on this end and as long as they don't introduce too much sound which we can check, they should be just fine. And let's look at these things. First off, holy cow, are these things ever heavy? It's a hundred percent solid metal. There is, the headband here is metal. The entire side of the ear cup is metal and this texture's actually like it's sharp. I run my fingers along it and I'm worried I'm gonna get like a paper cut or I guess just a normal cut when it's metal but it looks really, really cool. Also, look at the size of the ear cups on these. Look inside, look at how much space you have in there. You could live in there. You'd have to pay rent if you wanted this much space in Vancouver. Roomy, this is a fake leather for sure. This isn't real leather. Same with on the headband. It's two different, it's different textures on the headband though, they go for elastic instead of a cushion. I find that this works pretty well for me. I know that some people have complaints about this style of a headband because if you're somebody who wiggles around a lot or you have a smaller head what it can do is that if it's too tight it kind of starts slowly like kind of moving up your head and then it's gonna be bothering the bottom of your ears. I know Jake Tie has complained to me about that before. Even here we got like six hex screws like these are built like a fricking tank, six on each side just for this headband. I guess if you really wanted, you could probably just replace the headband on these 'cause there's no wires or anything going through the top. I do feel like this kind of disrupts the look of them. It's just like, it's a beautiful circle and dun. Oh they also have like you can see on the inside of this ear cup, there's like a, some breathing holes for that ear breath. These are open back, so don't expect any sort of isolation. You can basically see through them at this point. The ear cups, they are, hey look at that. They're removable. So funny story, I had these a little bit earlier and I dropped them and that's how I found out that you can do this, you can just take them out. I was very worried when I dropped these because this whole thing fell out and I thought that I had broken them for good, but then I realized that this is all the electronics you need. This is just a headband. You can see the diaphragm the metal that just goes all the way around. So here's the thing this is a 100 millimeter driver. This whole thing is the driver. That's the cool thing about planar magnetics is that unlike a dynamic driver where you have a coil that you have a small coil that's surrounded by a magnet that then pushes a large diaphragm with planar magnetics, you have magnets that go along the entire plane of your diaphragm and then when an electric charge is put on each side of it it wiggles the diaphragm and that produces a sound. So instead of having the sound focused kind of from the center of the woofer at the back you have this whole thing producing sound. So it's like that as opposed to like a cone. And part of that is what gives like their unique kind of sound. Like people often talk about like the speed or the precision of the base response in planar magnetics. It's not, and that's because you're not trying to have one small magnet move a big diaphragm. You have all of this diaphragm, all of these magnets working together to move a lot more air. On the other hand that does tend to make these more expensive to manufacture than a typical dynamic driver. Also, they're just not as popular. So there's less people focusing on making really cheap planar magnetics but it's getting better and better these days. If you're interested in trying out the planar magnetic sound but don't think it's like gonna change your life it's not like, wow I've never heard my music like this before. It's like it's minute differences but I think it's, I'm partial to planar magnetics myself. Other than that, there's nothing on these. There's just the three and a half millimeter inputs no buttons or any of that other fluff. This is pure audio. Let's weigh them. 572 grams. I think they actually go over, I think they reported to be 600. Yeah, maybe with the cable you're right though it could be 30 grams. So if I go like 615, yeah, so I mean this part's not gonna be carrying too much weight, but that's a lot. That's half a kilogram. That's like a jar of peanut butter putting on your head.

No as I said, these are open back headphones. There's something about planar magnetics that makes them particularly bad is open back headphones because it takes very little to make them very audible. I don't know, can you guys hear it? Yeah, it's surprisingly not loud, but the thing about these planet magnetics is that they leak so much of those really high end frequencies that it makes it very noticeable for anyone around you. This is not an office headphone. Also, when you don't have music playing you can basically hear the whole world. What that does do is it provides 'em with a little bit of a better sound stage. Though I'm not amazed by this headphones sound stage I find that it is adequate. I find that these headphones sound tend to sound very clear. They're a little brighter. I don't find it to be an issue but you could argue that they're on the brighter side like when listening to Scatman's World by Scatman John, you really do hear those like high pitched high hats, (sings) Scatman, and they can be a little peaky. I found that listening to Aja by Steely Dan you can really hear this like kind of bell, or, it's not a triangle, I don't know what it is. I don't know percussion instruments all that well but there's like a really really high pitched like ding that is just so noticeable on these headphones. But in terms of timbre, these things sound awesome especially with like string instruments. I find that like acoustic guitar violins all sound really really lifelike. Like Tamacun by Rodrigo y Gabriela, it sounds so good on here. It's immaculate. It's like you I could like see the guitar strings vibrating even though I'm just listening, in terms of base response, at the very, very low end. It's a little bit lacking. There's a little bit of a roll off but you still have that kind of precision that you get from a planar magnetic headphones that makes things like double kicks and metal sound really, really really punchy and precise and tracks like Born in Winter or From the Sky by Gojira. The base kicks feel powerful but also like not muddied they're not ruined. It's really, really great. This is a funny enough, this solid metal headphone is a solid metal headphone. (boo sound effect) But we got labs to measure them so we can take a more objective look at what they actually sound like on our fancy new head. Here we go. In a previous video about the Focal Bathys, we talked about frequency response. One thing to note is that that graph in that video is not gonna be comparable to the one that we have here today because it's measured on a different system. It was measured in a different location and we're measuring on our brand new BNK 528. It's the kind of the gold standard, but it means that things like the Harmon target are less relevant because the Harmon target was researched on different equipment and so it's not directly applicable. We're working on developing our own target that will be used as a simple very low level guide as to is this headphone generally good? So use the measurement for the Venus in the green. That's the measurement of this headphone. The dotted line is our target. It's not finalized or anything. It could change in the future, but as you can see the base response, especially the very low base below 40 kilohertz is a little bit lacking. It's a about seven or eight decibels lower than where our target is, the mids it follows the line pretty well. It's pretty close and we can see a pretty steady bump over in the upper mids in the treble. But here's where you can see kind of some of the peaks like look at that peak way at the top right around the 14 kilohertz region. That's where stuff like really high sibilance, so stuff like Ss and Ts can get a little bit out of hand. I found it only in very specific scenarios to be a little too much. Other than that, it's not a terribly bright headphones. So if you're somebody who doesn't like really bright detailed sound, you're not gonna be overwhelmed by these. Now we can compare them to say the HD 800S's. You can see that this has more base presence than the HD 800S's and it tends to be less bright. In the five to eight kilohertz region, the HD 800S tend to be a lot more louder so there's a little bit more brightness to them. Some people find it a little fatiguing. It tends to be a little bit less peaky. You can see that there's fewer lows and highs and it's more kind of control and a steady curve. But that's also a headphone that is literally triple the price of these. And that's where these are really interesting is that this is a $600 headphone, which puts it in an interesting place in terms of headphone pricing. There's a weird chasm between the enthusiast headphones where you see stuff like Sennheiser, HD 600s, the like flagship where you see like $1,800 headphones, like the HD 800S's. These are kind of going somewhere in the middle there for better or for worse. That's a good thing because in a lot of ways especially when it comes to like build quality these things are built like a tank. But then you have to think about like what can you get for a better price that has a very similar performance. And while these are I think, great sounding headphones there's a lot of competition even within the planar magnetic space. You have the Hifiman Sundara, which are planar magnetics and have rightfully earned their place as a great enthusiast planar headphone. They're like half the price and they also sound pretty dang good. I don't think they look as good. I found that when I listened to these, when I spent some time with these, the weight didn't bother me. But it is something you really have to consider if you're just gonna be sensitive to heavy headphones. These are very heavy. Personally, I had no issue, because it's a circle and it's not a crazy, crazy size. It leaves you open to options of getting custom ear pads or replacement ear pads, which can change the sound drastically. Especially if you go for something that's more open you can lose the base or if you go for something that's thicker you can really enhance the base response on these. It's a admirable entry and I think a really really good first attempt, which makes me very excited to see where Moondrop takes their headphone line up from here. If somebody decided to purchase these headphones they would be absolutely happy with them. I think it's a great product, so well done. They're a great product just to be aware that there's other options that exist for slightly cheaper. You can do that with them and you can subscribe to Short Circuit. If you like this video, why don't you watch my video about the Focal Bathys, another really great pair of headphones that are, you know, within striking distance of the same price, but they're wireless.",

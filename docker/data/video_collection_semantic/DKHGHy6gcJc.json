    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine, I'm currently in Hawaii. And I just got my hands on the new Samsung Galaxy S20, this is the pink version. You guys know when I was at the event and I saw that they announced this, I was honestly freaking out because the color of it is just so incredible. I know you've seen it already but now it's here in person, in my hands! I just can't believe it. It looks really, really good. Obviously, I like to color coordinate my outfits for the phone that I'm unboxing. So, I'm sure at this point, you've seen everyone unbox a bunch of Samsung phones. This is the S20, there's two other versions, there's the S20 Plus and the S20 Ultra, which is the highest end line of phone that Samsung currently has. And I'll tell you what, the thing looks really great. I still just wish that, that phone came in pink. I mean, really, you guys should think about it. So this model starts at 999, it has the same triple camera setup as the others but it is lacking the depth vision camera. Got a 10 megapixel selfie camera, 12 megapixel ultra wide, 12 megapixel wide angle and a 64-megapixel telephoto. It also does 8K video, it has a smaller 6.2 inch amoled display and it's cool because all three of these new models of phones do have a have 120 hertz display. If you've never really seen 120 hertz screen before, I recommend you go to a store that has these, I know Best Buy has them. Just go check it out, just look how incredible it looks. I definitely have my fingers crossed that Apple will be integrating 120 hertz screen this year, I feel like that's gonna be a pretty common standard in most phones going forward. This also has 8K shooting capabilities, which is really, it's kind of crazy just to think about, being able to have something in your pocket that does shoot 8K. The only thing that I've seen from some people who've done reviews already, and that have shown some test footage, is the 8K crop. So I think for most people that are getting these phones, I don't really think that they're even going to be shooting in 8K. You can choose to shoot however high of the quality that you want and of course, if you do shoot something in 8K, you can downgrade it to 4K, there are onboard editing apps, which make that super simple. So that does bring up a point of storage, if you are shooting a lot of 8K content, it will eat up your storage a little bit faster but you can expand this storage up to one terabit with a Micro SD card. It has a 128 gigs internal storage, 12 gigs of RAM and a 4000 milliamp battery. So, normally, I have my iPhone and then I have a secondary Android device and usually whatever the newest one is at the time that I'm testing out, that's what it is. And I have had my secondary phone as the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip recently. I did plan on making a follow up video to this thing and for some reason I never got around to doing it yet. I've been super busy and traveling but it's been very interesting to see the reaction that this phone has had with people. As I'm visiting my parents, and my dad, we were sitting at dinner and he was on his phone, just reading about the latest news and this was maybe, like, two or three days after this phone was released. And he's like, \"Did you guys hear about this folding phone?\" And I'm sitting there, this phone is sitting right next to my plate and he had no idea at all. I was like, \"Oh.\" And I just handed it over to him, I was like, \"Hmm, hmm, hmm.\" It is a cool phone, it's great. I don't even know what else to say about it, 'cause this video's supposed to be about this little guy. I think Samsung did a really great job with this Flip, so just, you guys, thumbs up. Let's see what else is in the box. Oh, charging brick, AKG headphones, (whoops) USB-C. What's this? Nothing, trash. I totally missed the case for the flip phone when I first unboxed it. So I'm gonna go get this charged, and set up, and I'll take it out for a spin. (gasps) I gotta be very careful. I can not be trusted. I just finished my unboxing and now we're gonna head to dinner and then we're gonna go for a little walk. Like I said before, we're in O'ahu, this is one of my favorite islands in Hawaii, it's just beyond beautiful. So it's kind of unfair when you bring a smartphone here to do camera tests because everything looks amazing. But first, dinner. - What a lovely evening. What are you doing? - [Justine] I don't know, I'm testing. (upbeat music) Wow, Jenna did park very close to this car. Yeah, maybe you should just move over. - I'm gonna just move over. - [Justine] Yeah, move over, yep. Jenna just told me to not take a selfie in the middle of the road 'cause I'm gonna get squished. - If I saw a person taking a selfie in the middle of the road, you stupid idiot. - Do they know that I'm doing a phone review, probably not. I feel a little rain sprinkle. - [Jenna] That was me, I spit on you. - [Justine] We've got our wide angle, 1X and 3X. What's really cool about some of these newer phones is, they're obviously enhancing the zoom lens. The S20 Ultra has 100X zoom. I feel like it's a little gimmicky, 'cause obviously the 100X zoom does not look that incredible but the fact that you can do 100X zoom on a cellphone and still be able to actually make out what you're taking a picture of, is still pretty cool. So the S20 has a 30X zoom, so let's take a few photos and let's see what that looks like. (upbeat music) All right, I went through all of the zooms, the 30X looks pretty cool, it's kinda crazy 'cause look how far away that building is. I mean, it's all the way over there. Time to eat. This is one of my favorite restaurants, there's a few of them on the island, so, I've actually never been to this current location, but hey, let's do it, let's just go. Hi, everybody. Jenna. So here's my salad. I got the fish salad so it's basically a salad with fish. It's a salad with fish. Did you like that one, Mom? (laughing) It's raining. - [Jenna] A little bit. - [Justine] A few drops, bye (mumbles) - [Jenna] Assaggio's. - Assaggio's. We still gonna go for a walk? - Yeah. - Okay, the sun is slowly setting. (casual music) Oh, no, it has started raining. We're gonna miss the sunset, well, it's currently setting right now. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Jenna shattered her iPhone here last year, she just got it, it slid all the way down here, it was so traumatizing. Look at Jenna over there. It is raining very hard. - [Jenna] We should go. - [Justine] We probably should. There's the sunset through the trees. - Ow! We gotta go. - So I guess we're gonna go now. I think it's raining pretty hard. The sunset is so pretty though. - [Jenna] Keep goin'? - [Mom] I don't care. - [Jenna] Oh, does Dad care? - Oh, no, I can't breathe! Oh, there we go, there's the other side. - [Dad] There you go. - Where'd you get this bag at? - [Jenna] What about me? - [Justine] What about Jenna? - [Dad] Well, if you can fit in there, go ahead. - [Mom] He was supposed to put that on. - I don't want it. - But I'm fine. I don't need it. - Poncho. - I got a poncho now. (casual music) So pretty, it's still raining. - [Jenna] Do we take my pictures? - Yeah. - [Jenna] Even though there's a wet mess? - Yeah, do you want my plastic bag? - [Jenna] (laughs) No. - Okay. I don't know if this is helping or making it worse 'cause now the water has run down all of my entire body, that was on the bag. (upbeat music) I guess that concludes my Samsung S20 vlog. We've run outta light, which means the vlog is over. I'm heading home to edit. I'll see you guys later. I look forward to making some more videos here in Hawaii. I have a couple other fun tech things to unbox, so look for those soon. Also, go follow me on TikTok because I'm obsessed. Find me on Instagram, Twitter, don't forget to subscribe, like, comment and do all of the things. I'll see ya, bye. (upbeat music)",

    "transcript": "What is love Baby don't tech news, no more - After being threatened with antitrust lawsuits from basically every government ever, Google is finally getting sued by the US Department of Justice. The case centers around Google Search and it's completely dominant position in the search engine market. But being dominant isn't enough to justify an antitrust lawsuit. The government is using the fact that Google pays billions of dollars a year to companies in exchange for pre installing Google Search on their devices and preferring it over competitors like DuckDuckGo, which only further solidifies Google's powerful position. So it's about distribution. To be fair, there's a reason Google has become synonymous with online search. It's that, Ask Jeeves sucks. And so does Bing. It's unclear what will come of this legal conflict, but similar cases against Google in the EU have resulted in fines and changes to the way the company bundles Android services. Although the EU has a lot more teeth with antitrust. So maybe this is just election prop like, posturing, I don't know. We could also see absolutely nothing happened. What are the lawyers using to search for evidence against Google? It ain't Yahoo, buddy. The library, Riley. AMD saw the way NVIDIA's RTX 3000 series launch was knocked completely off the rails by scalpers, so they've set out a set of guidelines for retailers to follow, so all the RX 6000 cards don't end up on eBay for like three times the price. These recommendations include using realtime bot detection, purchase limits, queue based reservations, and more. And, if you're like these cards aren't even gonna be good, James, yer numpty, well, I resent that. And you might be so wrong. Because leaks are pointing to at least one card in the lineup being able to achieve 2.5 gigahertz boost clock. That's pretty high. Is it high enough to unseat Nvidia from its throne at the top of the GPU hierarchy? Almost certainly not. But we'll find out for sure, when AMD unveils the cards next week. And Apple is removing the custom browser app that some tinkerers were using to play Stadia on iOS. Because, of course they did. Developer Zachary Knox had made the Stadium app to get around Apple's restrictions on game streaming services. But the charge that Apple's levying against the app isn't even related to that. Stadium is being taken down because it breaks Apple's guidelines for connecting Bluetooth controllers. This might be bad news for Stadia, but it might also make people search it up and try those new free demos of services offering, which might convince some people, even game streaming skeptics, to sign up and love it and play Stadia forever. Probably not, bring us to the quick bits, Riley. - Now, it's time for quick bits, brought to you by OneProvider, the data center services consolidator. They're One Cloud service makes it easy to roll out your personal blog, database, or storage instance in any of its 39 occasions in just a few clicks. And they've got all your other web hosting needs covered as well, no matter the budget or project type with dedicated servers in 140 locations. Once you set up, you can manage all your servers, dedicated and virtual, in a single place with the One Panel dashboard. So click the link in the description below, to deploy today. - Thanks Riley, but I'll take it from here. Quick bits, yeah! Twitch streamers have had a large number of videos deleted after Twitch sent out a sudden wave of copyright takedowns. The takedowns are apparently in response to an influx of DMCA claims the site received in June. But only processed, just now. It doesn't really explain why they had to delete the videos first and send copyright notices second. Hey, but this is Twitch. There's no time to discuss, we're live. Speaking of Twitch, the platform got a bit of a boost yesterday, when US Congresswoman, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez streamed Among Us with some popular creators. The stream reached 439,000 viewers at it's peak. Granted, there were probably a few people watching just to see AOC's avatar ejected into space. But regardless, having a sitting US representative play the meme game of the year, well, fit perfectly into the 2020 chapter of future history textbooks. If there are textbooks, after everything gets burned. Microsoft has announced that all Minecraft players will have to switch from using a Mojang account to a Microsoft one, drawing parallels to the whole Oculus Facebook situation. But Microsoft seems to be clearly explaining why they're doing this with the promise that absolutely nothing will be effected for the end user. Plus you get a cape. I'm sure if Oculus users just got a cape, everything would be fine. They weren't promised anything. Short form video service Quibi, is shutting down after launching just six months ago and the jokes write themselves here, people. It looks stupid, and I guess it was. The shutdown is also happening one day after the services apps launched on Apple TV, Android TV and fire TV. Wow, see you later, Quibi. We hardly knew ye. No one did, you didn't have enough users, wow. And it's time for our wacky tech moment of the day brought to you by, these weird wrist mounted controllers which provide haptic feedback in VR, by having a little motorized ball extend from your forearm, your forearm, I got one of those, two act little motorized ball extended from your forearm up to your hand when you grab something in game. This will almost certainly not be how haptics work in VR in the future, but Hey, we can have some fun with the completely, ridiculous thing right now. We deserve it. 2021 is gonna suck too. And you deserve a video that doesn't overstay its welcome. So, come back on Friday for more tech.",

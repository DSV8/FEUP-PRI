    "transcript": "- Hello and welcome to This Is. Austin, why are you an Apple fanboy? - Because clearly Apple products are the best things that I can possibly imagine. Matt, you can't see me right now but I'm holding up my Microsoft Surface Go 2, the superior choice for this particular video. So we have a very thorough tier list of pretty much every single Apple product and service so let's go through starting with the MacBook Air. I actually think for the first time since like 2013, 2014, the MacBook Air is not only a solid laptop but I think a really easy recommendation. We did a video on the main channel where essentially they fixed all of the major issues. It has a much better keyboard, still great trackpad, pretty decent specs now, and it's seen a price cut which means that for I would say, 11, $1200, similar to what you would get an XPS 13 for or something, you can get a really well spiked out MacBook Air. I think the MacBook Air is not only a solid product, but for me we're starting out with a firm A tier on this one. - Yeah, I mean, it's clearly the college student special. Like, that will get you through all four years of college no problem. It's a really solid laptop, yeah, I'll give you A tier. - Next up we have the MacBook Pro, and specifically the 13-inch. This one is weird to me. So previously the MacBook Pro always had a major advantage. If you think like a few years ago, The MacBook Pro had way more ports, it was significantly more powerful. But now though, the MacBook Pro is while, yes, it has a little bit more power than the Air I would argue it's not a huge amount and certainly nothing like the 16-inch. And the problem is it's expensive. - I don't know who the 13-inch MacBook Pro is for now that the Air is out, I'm gonna I'm gonna say C tier. - I was thinking between C and D but I'll give you C on that one. It's just, if you want a 13-inch MacBook, if you want more performance than the Air you should pick the next product which is the MacBook Pro 16-inch. So as someone who does own a 16-inch MacBook Pro it is an excellent choice for us still fairly thin but powerful workstation. So compared to the older 15-inch, you get bigger screen in the same size chassis, it's slightly thicker which means that not only were they able to fit a bigger battery, but you have the full eight core processor, you have the upgraded graphics, and on top of all of that you're getting what I think is probably the sort of best trade-off between performance and battery life in a laptop that you can get right now. Honestly, it's expensive but if you're a person who needs a 16-inch MacBook Pro you know you're a person who needs a 16-inch MacBook Pro. - I'll agree with you on all of that. But the thing that I can't really overlook with that is just how expensive they make these upgrades. When you're talking like thousands of dollars to jump up with SSDs, if we're talking like a buy list I'm giving it a B. If I look to buy a Windows laptop I'm expecting it to last me like maybe two years. If I'm buying a Mac laptop I'm expecting it to last maybe three, four, five, years. I mean, I've been using the the 2018 i9 MacBook 15-inch and I have no plans to upgrade that anytime soon. The problem with that is my hard drive's filling up. My RAM is looking a little dated right now. So because everything is soldered down, knowing that this is gonna be kind of outdated a little bit, and that's where I'm gonna give it the B. Because again, you can't you can't change any component and it's so expensive to try and future-proof this for yourself. For that $3,000 bump or whatever for the SSD you might we'll just go buy another laptop at that point. - [Austin] I will agree B tier the 16-inch MacBook Pro. - So the regular iMac, not the iMac Pro, this, I mean,, how do you want to tackle this one because there's the 24-inch and there's a 27-inch? - [Austin] No, it's a 21-inch. - Oh, that's right, the 21-inch and 27-inch. they feel like two completely different computers to me. If you were gonna look at the 27-inch, honestly I would say A tier. - What, what? Wait, really, dude, hold on. - I had the 27-inch iMac for years and the only reason I stopped using it is 'cause my dog broke the screen when he threw a toy at it. - [Austin] Nibbler. - It's a gorgeous screen, it was plenty powerful, everything that I needed to do for it. I mean, I wasn't doing super high-end stuff but I was video editing. And then you look down at like the 21-inch and the CPU was pretty bad, the GPU is even worse. I mean, it is a mobile GPU in both of them. If we're looking at iMac as a whole I think the 21-inch drags it down really significantly, I'm actually gonna say it's C tier. - I will, agree iMac as of today in mid 2020, C tier. Speaking of the iMac, the iMac Pro this is a weird one. So, full disclosure, we have a couple of iMac Pros as edit stations here at the office. However, we've had these iMac Pros for two and a half years now and the problem is is that the iMac Pro really hasn't seen an upgrade since then, right? It's still using those same, older Xeon processors, it's still using the Vega graphics, and to be completely fair, there aren't massive upgrades short of going to something like Thread Ripper. But the iMac Pro was pretty much brought out as sort of like a stopgap between the standard iMac and the Mac Pro and then it almost feels like it's been abandoned. - Yeah, because again, I don't know who it's for. So, I mean, it starts at $5,000. So right away it's out of reach for most enthusiasts. But then if you do have that kind of money chances are you can probably afford to jump up and get the Mac Pro. - I really struggle to recommend a computer that is two plus years old with zero updates. I feel like it's D tier. - [Matt] Yeah, I completely agree. - Well, speaking of the Mac Pro, let's talk about the brand new late 2019 Mac Pro 'cause this thing is ridiculous. So when it comes to the current Mac Pro this is a ridiculous system. It starts at $6,000. - That's not counting the wheels, the wheels are a little ridiculous. - There is so much to like about the Mac Pro and if you're the right person, that's great. But I think the right person is MKBHD and all of Hollywood. Besides that, I don't really think they're selling a lot of these Mac Pros. - It's not meant for the everyday user. And a lot of people don't get that. - I'm not gonna hate on the ability for Apple to sell a very expensive computer. Just like with the RAM from the MacBook Pro, I don't think there's any problem with selling something that's super expensive. I'm not gonna buy one, you're probably not gonna buy one. - I paid $5,000 for the Mac Pro that we upgraded back in like 2011. But again now here we are eight years later and that computer, we were running that and we upgraded it and it ran just as well as that iMac Pro according to Jimmy. I'm gonna give it a B. - I 100% agree. I think it's a very nice product, but the Mac Pro deserves B tier for me. It's funny, we have so many Mac's on this list, however we're missing one which is the little baby Mac Mini. I'll be real, I like to Mac Mini. It's a weird computer because obviously it's a desktop, it does not support any dedicated graphics so you're still getting sort of low-end sort of desktop components with like a quad core or a six core processor, a little out-of-date, at this point it's probably what, a year and a half old, maybe closer to two years. - I love this thing. You know, we used it as an editing PC for a while. You know, just hooking up an eGPU to it. - Yeah, and essentially our setup with the Mac Mini is a core i7 with 32 gigs of RAM and then we plug into an external graphics card through Thunderbolt and then we actually get sort of similar performance to something like a iMac or even a little bit similar to what you would get on like an iMac Pro in some cases on the lower end before a significantly cheaper price. I would like to see him an upgrade, but I feel pretty confident calling the Mac Mini C tier. - C tier, I would have given it a B. - It needs an update and it does run a little warm, but the fact that it has like 10 gig Ethernet as an option is really killer in such a tiny little PC, so I'll say C. - [Matt] I personally woulda gone B but I see where you're coming from with the update. - Matt, what are your thoughts on the Pro Display XDR? - I mean, it's the same thought I have on the Mac Pro. It's not meant for you because if you're in Hollywood you're probably using a much better color accurate display. - The thing I don't like about the Pro Display XDR is that it's very expensive and while it's good for most people I don't think it makes sense, 'cause you're right, if you are on a crazy high end of production you're probably looking at something like some like Sony reference monitor, which is probably going to make a little bit more sense. And if you are not on that crazy high-end, I personally really like something, especially inside the Apple ecosystem, like the LG Ultrafine 5K which is one fifth of price and it's still an excellent panel, 5K resolution, that's what I've been dailying for years. - I agree, I agree. The Apple Magic Mouse. - Boo, F tier. F tier, F. - Yeah,, I'm gonna say the same thing for the trackpad. - Magic Mouse, of course F. Trackpad I don't think deserves an F, I think the trackpad actually is obviously the best trackpad Apple makes sort of in the business and the fact that you can use it with like an iPad or with like a Mac or something, I'm okay with trackpad, I'd be willing to give that like B, C, something like that? - B or C, I was gonna give it an F. - Why, what's wrong with the trackpad? - I hate having a trackpad on a desktop. - Yeah, but some people like trackpads. - Fine, fine, you like it, I'm giving you a C. - C, okay Magic Trackpad, gets a C. The iPad pro is excellent. - S tier. - Wow, you're S tier already, I wasn't even-- - Yeah. - Why is it S tier? 'Cause I would argue it's closer to A tier. - It is easily one of my favorite devices that I've ever owned, period. I do a lot of drawing with it. It's replaced my drawing tablet, in fact, the only reason I'm not using it right now for this video is because we went to go speed my iPad was dead because I forgot to charge it. - I mean to be fair, my Surface was dead so I had to plug it in while I'm recording too. - I use it so often for most of what I do. - Yeah, so for me I have actually switched over to the iPad pro as my main computer. I still do use the Surface sort of alongside it for some things, but generally speaking the iPad Pro is what lives with me all day long, it's what I do pretty much everything on. I would say this is A bordering S for me, I really love the iPad Pro. - I'm sticking with S, I'm sticking with S, man. - Okay, I think a lot of people are gonna disagree with us but the iPad Pro, S tier. Alongside the iPad Pro, Magic Keyboard, it's a bit of a weird one. So if we take price out of the equation Magic Keyboard, A plus plus, S tier, killer, great, it's nicely weighted, it has that very cool floating iPad look. You have a good keyboard as well as excellent trackpad which is to be fair a little bit small. It completely transforms the iPad. The only complaint I have, short of I wish it had a little bit more of a tilt angle, is the fact that it is $300, or $350, if you're buying the 12.9 inch, which to me is ludicrous for a keyboard for a tablet. - I 100% agree. I personally decided not to get one, mainly 'cause of the price. But again, with me doing all the drawing that I do, the fact that it can't tilt back more than like a 45-degree angle or whatever. - C? - C, yeah. - Speaking of accessories, this is actually something I feel like you're gonna be much more knowledgeable about than me, is the Apple Pencil. - I'm gonna give this one an A. I struggle to even use my iPad without it. Now, to be fair I don't, like I said, I don't use the Magic Trackpad so I haven't like had the same experience as you, but I mean, for drawing it is wonderful. Especially now with Catalina having Sidecar, you can turn your iPad into a drawing tablet for something like Photoshop and whatnot and the Pencil has been completely invaluable to me for making like our thumbnails, being able to do those fine details with using that is super helpful, I'm going with A. - Okay, I'll go with that. Next up we have the iPad Air. This is F tier for me for one very simple reason, it's old and the base iPad exists. We need an update for this thing, it feels out of date, it feels way too expensive. - [Matt] I wouldn't be surprised if it just goes away completely. - I think there's room for a mid-range iPad but right now that doesn't exist because there is the base model iPad. Matt, I have obviously been sort of very much on the iPad bandwagon lately, but the base iPad is the one to get. Technically this is a $330 iPad. However it is often on sale for as low as $250, and for that you are getting what is honestly a real laptop style device. Obviously if you want to use this an iPad, great, and most people do that, but you do have the ability to do more with this if you spend a little bit more money on something like the keyboard. I'm gonna just go straight out and say it, I think the base model iPad is S tier and in fact if there was an SS tier I would put it there. I love that base iPad, even though it might not have the most powerful specs. - I won't argue with that at all. Like, I completely agree. If this had existed when I went and looked and got the iPad Pro I probably would have gotten this over the iPad Pro just to save the money. - Well that leaves us with the iPad Mini, which is a weird one because this was kind of dead for a while, it wasn't updated for years and years. And it was updated I believe last year with an upgraded processor and I believe Apple Pencil support. The thing with the iPad Mini is I used to love the iPad Mini, that was like my first real iPad way back in like 2012, 2013, but to me phones have gotten so big and stuff like the base iPad exists which is cheaper. I struggle to place this one, I don't know, what do you think it lands? - Honestly I'm just gonna give it, I want to say like a C or D. - I would lean toward D. Next we have Air Pods Pro. Matt, are you wearing Air Pods Pro right now? - Now these are my favorite headphones, period. Like hands down. Now, I don't think they're particularly great sounding but the convenience of them is through the roof for me. Me, personally S tier, but I get why they wouldn't be S tier for a lot of people. - I'm in total agreement there, I think Air Pods Pro are, while they're not amazing sounding, they sound decent, but importantly they have excellent integration with all of your Apple devices. Sort of moving between is sort of second to none besides maybe some of the Sony stuff. And they also have what I would consider to be good active noise cancellation for a fully wireless headphone. I totally agree, A Tier on that. - So then we have the regular Air Pods. So there's one feature on here I love way more than the Air Pod Pros, and it's the ability to hang up a call. I would give these a B. - I'll agree, I think that most people would be better served spending that little bit of extra money to get the Air Pods Pro with the wireless charging case and everything. But, these standard Air Pods 2 are, especially when you get them on sale, so B tier. Now we get into a tricky sort of place because now we have the iPhone 11 and we can sort of lump in the iPhone 11 Pro as well. So these are phones which are very, very good. But these are phones which I am almost like allergic to recommending right now, simply because we're filming this in June of 2020. We know pretty much for a fact that there are iPhone 12s with an all-new design with 5G that are just a few months away. So while I like the iPhone 11 and really recommended it when it first came out, and I still use an iPhone 11 Pro on a pretty regular basis, if you're trying to buy an iPhone today that is crazy town. - I agree, if this was list strictly on how, ranking the products in a vacuum without the new phone coming along, I love the iPhone 11, it's been great for me. But no one should get this right now, you should wait a couple months, get the next model. - My thought is, if you're going to buy one of these phones I would recommend the iPhone 11 so I would say maybe the iPhone 11 gets D tier. No, I think they both need D tier 'cause it's so tough recommend. - [Matt] It's very hard to recommend these. - You know what's not hard to recommend? The iPhone SE. So this is a brand new device, in some ways, and yet it's a very old device in others. So it has the iPhone 8 design, which is the same as the iPhone 7, which is similar to the iPhone 6s, which is based on the iPhone 6. So obviously very dated bezels, you've got touch ID, but on the flip side for $400 you get these same specs as that iPhone 11 or iPhone 11 Pro, you get an upgraded camera which is not too far off, not quite as good but still pretty impressive, and you get the wireless charging, the water resistance, you get a lot of those high-end features for a budget phone from this company called Apple, which I think is revolutionary. I really, really like the iPhone SE. - I mean the chip, like the processor, is literally the most powerful you can get right now for 400 bucks. - A tier? - I woulda said B but I'll give you A. - Okay, I think that's fair, A tier to me feels right for the iPhone SE. So the next up we have a product, Matt, which I sometimes forget Apple still sells which is the very last of the iPods, the iPod Touch. - No one should buy an iPod Touch because it's only for a kid, you know, like someone who's not quite ready to have a phone. But let's face it, if you have a kid you have your old iPhone, give 'em that, take a SIM card out of it, don't buy the iPod. - Or even better if you don't have an older iPhone you can really easily pick up slightly older model iPhones either refurbished or you can get them on some like no contract carrier and boom, you've got yourself something which is as good if not better than that iPod, has full capabilities if you want them, and is likely going to be cheaper, I agree, F tier. Unless they really rethink the iPod Touch I don't think it needs to exist anymore. - So we all use Apple Watches here, this is the only Smartwatch that I ever really liked. I'm inclined to give Apple Watch A tier. - I really like the Apple Watch, I've liked the Apple watch since day one, I think Apple's done a very good job of recognizing that there's a market for a wearable which has all this functionality and continuing to make it better and better and better and better, right? Like they had a good starting place with some clear flaws and every year they make the battery better, they give it LTE, they give it Wi-Fi, they allow it to work better by itself. You get maybe not necessarily better app support but even the ability to have the always-on display, which to be fair still kind of kills your battery but they've done a very good job of consistently adding really good features. I would say this is a very clear A tier. - Next up we have the Apple Home Pod. Unless your name is Ken Balito I don't see much reason to buy a Home Pod. My main issue is it sounds great but it's incredibly expensive and even though it's seen some price cuts I don't really love Siri and I certainly don't love the idea of 200, $250, spending that much for the Home Pod. - Yeah, I agree. I mean, I got the IKEA Sonos lamp that looks exactly like a Pome Pod but it has a lamp on it, it sounds great, it does all the functionality, it's way cheaper. - The Apple TV 4K is an interesting device. I really like the way that sort of the Apple TV seamlessly especially if you have something like an LG OLED, it seamlessly transitions in and out of HDR modes, it is sort of a very cohesive experience. For me I think it's a pretty firm B tier, it's probably in need of an update with some newer specs at some points, it's getting a little bit old. - I haven't used one mainly because now they offer the Apple TV app with something like Roku. Like I said, I haven't really used one so I'll give you the B. - [Austin] Okay, yeah, that's a very good point. - Now we get into their services. So first we have Apple TV Plus, which we had done a video on where I claimed that it already failed and you know what, I'm sticking by that claim. I don't think anyone really is talking about how great Apple TV Plus is. One, I don't think anyone's actually paying for it 'cause everyone got it free when they bought an iPhone. - Dude it's too competitive, right? We have Disney Plus, we have obviously Netflix being a juggernaut. Apple TV Plus, man, I cannot sign up for that as is. I feel like there's probably improvements coming, I feel that they will likely have some kind of bundle, it's rumored to have sort of Apple TV Plus included with like news and like arcade and all this kind of stuff and Apple music which we can talk about in a second. I think it's D tier, I think it has some potential but man Apple TV Plus, it's D tier when it's free. - I would give a D if it wasn't currently free. Lastly we have Apple Music. - Yeah, look, there's nothing wrong with Apple Music, right? I mean, you have similar sort of libraries but the thing is for me as far as I'm concerned, I'm very happy with Spotify, C tier for Apple Music. There's nothing wrong with it but I don't see a lot of reason to actually pay for that service over something else. - [Matt] I completely agree with you on that. - With that we have our final Apple tier list. So take a look at this and let us know in the comments, do you agree with our tier list, are we wild idiots for putting two iPads on top every Apple product that they make? Let us know in the comment below, make sure to subscribe, and until next time, Matt, what mistake are we going to make next time? - I think people wanted a PlayStation tier list. - I mean, PS5, F tier obviously.

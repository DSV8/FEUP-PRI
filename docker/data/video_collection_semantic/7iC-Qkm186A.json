    "transcript": "So you've built your first pc nice or maybe you've built dozens of PCs by this point also nice you know what your pc is pretty much useless before setting a few things up including installing an operating system and in this short or maybe not so short video we'll show you how to do exactly that and while we're at it i'm also going to show you how you can activate windows for a little over 10 us dollars thanks to our sponsor vip scd key now assuming you've built your pc correctly everything should fire up for the first time without issue you should see all of your LEDs all of your fans should turn save maybe the graphics card if it's idle and that's how you know that nothing is inherently broken well maybe something's still broken but at least you know things are receiving power so your power supply is not screwed up anyway you'll probably be prompted into your bios for the first time if you don't have an operating system already installed and while we're in here we can optimize performance and sound but we'll circle back to this once we're ready to install windows now despite what you'll hear Microsoft windows is by far the most popular operating system for desktop and laptop computers not only is it relatively attainable and easy to set up with most hardware it also sports a widely understood user interface with a very shallow learning curve relatively speaking windows 8 is kind of the only exception but windows 8 was like mega horrible so i you know exception but according to stat counter windows 10 has blown up as the most popular operating system for desktop computers on the planet surpassing windows 7 as of january 2018 and becoming the os of choice for 77 of windows users in 2020 so we'll be showing you how to install the latest version of windows 10 in this video to get started you'll need access to another computer with a usb port and internet access i know it seems a bit redundant to need a second computer to set your first computer up but that's just how it is so maybe a laptop or something like a school computer those are fairly easy to access from there click on the link in this video description titled windows media creation tool this link will take you to microsoft.com you can click the blue download tool now button and then save that file i'd like to save things like that just to my desktop because i know where they go then you want to open it allow it to set a few things up and accept the license terms now again wait a few seconds then select the create installation media the recommended settings should be fine click next then ensure that the usb flash drive option is selected then click next again and at this point you'll want a thumb drive preferably eight gigs or higher this is a cheap 16 gig drive from team group and i've used it for dozens of windows installs but we'll assume for the sake of demonstration that nothing is currently on it connect it to your system and click the blue refresh drive list button at this point you should be able to see the flash drive if you don't see it you probably need to reformat it fat32 is the way to go go ahead and select it and click next now the tool will begin downloading windows 10 and installing files on the drive which will take several minutes and by the time it does finish you should see this window here confirming that the flash drive is ready to use select finish safely remove the thumb drive and connect it into a usb port at the back of your freshly built pc now some motherboards will automatically boot into the thumb drive if they can detect any other connected boot device but just for good measure i like to hop into my bios and at this point maybe tweak a few things including boot order that's one of the things we're definitely going to want to make sure is correct so when you push your computer's power button and it starts up for the first time just start spamming the delete key when the splash page pops up and you should very quickly boot into something that looks like this here this is your bios if you're new to the bios uh yeah bios meet viewer from here you can confirm that your storage drives are detected in the boot tab and select our usb drive as our primary boot device for now you can calibrate your fan curves in the hardware monitor tab by choosing from any of these presets or manually defining an rpm range for a given cpu temperature i also recommend enabling xmp profile assuming your cpu doesn't activate finicky when it is enabled and this can usually be done via the main tab it will give your system a bit of added performance especially in ryzen's case and will push your ram to rated frequencies well above the 2133 base for ddr4 keep in mind that this ui and the accompanying nomenclature will vary between motherboard vendors but the general points i'm outlining here should still stand next let's click save and exit confirm our choices and click again to reboot now at this point you should see something similar to this here followed by a bluish screen and a windows install prompt select next and then the install now button now at this point you'll be prompted to enter an activation key i want to stress though that it is not required and you could totally click this button here if you prefer to enter one later now you don't even need to enter one at all windows will still run just fine but if you don't want to see an activation watermark and you don't want to pay outrageous sums of cash for a retail key consider using an OEM Key from our sponsor in this video scdkey these oem keys are considerably cheaper and will activate your windows version without a hitch people seem to occasionally doubt the validity of these but i've used them for years without issue i wouldn't promote something that didn't work and many others have told me that they're they're thankful that they were introduced to the sponsor you can buy keys via the link in this video description can be the top link and you can use a secure payment method like paypal and use this video's unique offer code this one's important skgs for a 25 discount that's the lowest price of the year for this OEM key then input said key into this box here this will activate the applicable windows 10 version once you've established an internet connection at which point you may proceed with the os install accept the license terms then select the custom install option this will list all available storage drives connected to your pc in our case we only have one but it has multiple partitions because it was it previously had a windows operating system on it so i'm going to delete each of these to retain a fully unallocated volume onto which i can install windows if your storage drive is brand new it should already look something like this and if you have multiple drives make sure you select the one you want as your primary boot device before it moving forward you don't want to install this on like a super slow hard disk drive say this will typically be the fastest drive in your system that you select when the unallocated volume is highlighted click next and at this point windows 10 will begin installing this could take several minutes depending on the speeds of both the drives connected to your system as well as the ports being used but once things wrap up your system should automatically reboot you'll see your post page yet again maybe like an Asus or gigabyte logo something like that and then a few spinning circles when you see this that's a good sign things will get ready for a few minutes and you may notice a reboot or two do not interrupt this process finally you'll see this screen here running through these prompts is pretty self-explanatory i'm not gonna you know hold your hand through these but once you've finished you should end up on your a nice empty desktop by the way if you haven't already activated you can always retroactively do so by hopping into settings clicking this button here then this button here and entering your product key if the key is for a different version of windows you'll be prompted to update the os but this shouldn't harm any of your files so that's it that's it's really that simple i mean sure it's a bit time consuming but uh navigating through the steps is something that you really shouldn't be afraid of it's not a reason why you shouldn't jump into building your first pc so hopefully if you're new to pc building this video has clarified any concerns you've had and if none of this is news to you then i especially appreciate you watching this far end of the video nothing like a quick refresher i'd again like to thank our video sponsor scd keys for supporting us on this one and be sure to check out their oem windows keys via the top link in this video's description and remember don't forget to use our offer code skgs for 25 off of that oem key if you guys enjoyed this one or found it helpful consider giving it a thumbs up i would appreciate that click that subscribe button if you haven't already and i'll catch you in the next one my name is greg thanks for learning with me people seem to occasionally doubt the validity people people seem to occasionally people seem to occasionally doubt the validity of these people seem to occasionally doubt the validity of these i've had to tell so select the unallocated so select the amount select the allocated so select the analogy when the unallocated volume is highlighted click next when the unallocated volume is highlighted click next",

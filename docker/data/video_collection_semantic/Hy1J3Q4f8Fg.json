    "transcript": "- Today we are checking out a new mophie charger. This was just released fairly recently, but what makes this special is unlike most other mophie chargers, this one has an AC charging port. So things that you would normally plug into the wall you can now plug in to this guy. (knife opens) I probably don't even need this knife to be honest with you, but what kind of unboxing would it be if I didn't have it? USB, USB-C, and AC devices. Wow wee. (gasps) Oh my goodness! This thing is massive! (laughs) I am shocked! Geez, I don't know what I was expecting. I mean, this is kind of a heavy box. (gasps) Holy crap, this is actually massive. It's really big. Thank you. So this comes with two cables. Normally it usually only comes with one, but this comes with, actually they're both USB-C. So this is USB type A and then C, and this one is just two USB-Cs, which is quite exciting. You can never have enough of USB-C cables. So here's our 30 watt USB-C. This is a fast charging port. Here's our USB-A, it's a high output charging at 2.4 amps. Right here is our LED monitor to see how much batter life we have left, and it looks like we've got a half charge, which is excellent. And here we have what makes this mophie so special. This 110 volt, 100 watt AC output. This looks like it's just a little fan, which I assume this thing can probably put out a little bit of heat because it is a massive battery. It's got like a nice fabric finish, which, to be completely honest with you, I'm not a huge fan of this. While I don't like the fabricy texture of it, that's my personal preference because I don't like this feeling, but beside that, I do like it because it doesn't slip around on surfaces like this desk. It does give a little bit of grip, so it doesn't move around too much, which is nice. So it looks like this button will activate your AC plug, so unless you push this button, this isn't gonna be activate unnecessarily. (charger slides in) (phone dings) I'm shocked that it's charging. Like it's doing its job. It's not something that I should be surprised about. But you can see here the light is on, so that signifies that the AC is producing an output. And with that being said, we've still got two more ports that we can definitely use to charge other things. So with this mophie being 22,000 milliamps, this will give us 15 hours of laptop life, eight hours on DSLR cameras, 21 hours on large tablets, and 100 hours on smart phones. 100 hours? Do you believe it 'cause I just, you know, I just don't know. Well this looks absurd. I can't imagine this is something that most normal people would carry around, but let me show you what I do normally carry around, and mind you, I almost always have a large purse or backpack, so I'm always fully prepared with my batteries. The little baby brother or baby sister to this one is this guy. This was one of their USB-C versions. This was meant to charge laptops. But can you tell the size comparison between the baby, this is more than double this little guy. What I liked about this one is it had a USB-C charger, so this was basically made to charge USB-C laptops. Not just laptops, anything that was USB-C powered like most phones, other than iPhones nowadays, but it's okay. I'm not mad. So you have 22,000, 19,000. The one that I was using before this was actually 20,000. This one is fairly old. I think it's maybe about a year old. The only thing that I didn't like is it was kind of big, but I did get a little bit more life out of this, and it also has three USB ports, whereas this one only has two. It has one USB-A and one USB-C. Now before this one, I was using this one, and this mophie right here is still one of my favorites. Even though I think this one is about 15,000 milliamps, I love the slim form factor. This thing has went all around the world with me. And what's great is I could always slip it right into the front of a seat pocket. It fits in almost any laptop bag, any of my purses. And for whatever reason I love this one, too, because I felt like it always charged my devices a little bit faster, even though these ports are basically all the same ratings as all the others, still just felt like it was charging very, very quick. Also super reliable. Sometimes I feel like when I use one of the newer mophies, they don't always seem as reliable as far as like the battery goes. This'll say it's three bars, but then sometimes it'll just drop down very quickly, but this one has never failed me, ever. (device clinking) Except for, like that sound. That's definitely not something that you should ever hear. I don't even think they sell this one anymore, but it was still (gasps) oh my favorite. Anyway, these are my current mophie selections, and yeah, this is excessive. I don't think this is something that I will carry around on a daily basis, but if I am at something like CES or if I am going out to fly my drone, I can charge one of my smaller drone batteries off of this thing. Some of the newer drones you can charge just using USB, so this is great, too, because I will have so much extra power. I am extremely excited to try this out. I'm sure I will do a follow up on this, maybe not a specific entirely dedicated video, but I'm sure I will mention it at some point in a vlog or something or on Twitter. I don't know. I just don't think I can see myself, well, I could see myself making an entire other video about updating you on this thing. I'll put a link in the description where you can check out this one and some previous mophies. There are some other mophies that I do use that are a little bit smaller. They have a lot of them, oh let me see if I can find one for you. Ow, I hit my head! Ow, I hit my foot! I was supposed to be ending this video until I went into my mophie drawer. Now, full disclosure, I have been a mophie partner for a while, so they have sent me some mophies in the past. This pile, they've never sent me. Usually they send kind of like their special edition one, like this Supreme one, which I know a lot of you guys were into. They also sent me some of these, the iJustine ones, which I basically only gave out to some of my friends when my book was released. But these ones are so much smaller, which is probably better for most normal users. Like you don't need this, but I feel like I'm always charging something or somebody's always asking me for chargers. Why bring this out, is I just wanted to show you this, too, because these ones are great because you don't have to have another cable. These have the cable built in directly. So this has a lighting adapter, and it will change to a micro-USB. So depending upon which type of phone you have or what device you're trying to charge, this is already built in, which is very, very nice. And this one looks like it is 12,000 milliamps. 12,000? That's actually quite a lot. That's a lot more then I thought was in here. 'Cause if this is 15 and this is 12, and you're 15, wow wee. This one I actually broke. Although, it says it's still working, but I'm not sure if I believe it. This has wireless charging built into it. So let's see if it works. (phone dings) Voila, okay, well now it's actually working, so now I'm shocked because for a while this plug wasn't working 'cause I dropped it, and some things happened. (laughs) (phone dings) I'm actually quite excited that this works now. How many milliamps are you? This is 10,000? I'm shook. I just reorganized all of my gadgets. This is not a mophie. This one's by Belkin, but I did an unboxing of this before. This has a built in Apple Watch charger, so you just place your little Apple Watch right there and this also charges. This one is only 6,700, so you're not gonna get much of a charge, but I do like this because it does have the Apple Watch charger built in. So as for my suggestions on chargers, this is probably one of my favorites as far as portability and packing a lot of power. This one is incredible because it does wireless charging. So glad it's working. Oh my goodness. I love portable power so much. Like I'm so prepared for the apocalypse. Well I'm not actually, this might only get me through like a week. Plus some of these aren't charged. I've got to do some charging. It's Friday night, and baby, I am at home hanging out with my mophie chargers. Like what is happening? Sometimes when I just like stop and think like what did I do in my life to get me to the point where I'm making videos about my love for portable power? Some people have hobbies like running, knitting. This is mine. (laughs) (upbeat music) Well thank you guys so much for watching. Let me know in the comments what chargers do you guys use? Is this a little bit excessive? Should I get a new hobby? Should I go outside? I think I probably maybe should go outside. But not right now 'cause it's late and it's dark out, so I'm gonna go edit this video. Bye! (soft music)",

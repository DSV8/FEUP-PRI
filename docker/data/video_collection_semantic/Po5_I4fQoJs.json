    "transcript": "- Hi, so this video's a little bit different. Yes, there will be an unboxing, but this is something that is very special. It is custom, it is handmade. I saw this TikTok and I left a comment. It's a custom iBook with an iPad with a keyboard and it actually works. He had made this one for Meghan Trainor and I was like, \"Whoa, if she doesn't step up, let me know,\" and I was so here for it that it took me seven days to see in the comments that he had actually made me this. He was like, \"Letting you know that I made you a custom iBook.\" I just can't wait to see it. I don't know what's in here though, this is another little tiny package. So a huge thank you to SkipperFilms for making this and sending it to me, this is such a fun little treat. He makes a bunch of custom ones, you can actually buy these. So without further ado, let's get into it. This is really in there. Oh, my God, this is so great! Okay, alright, here we go. We've got a little USB cable. Very nicely packaged. Oh, my goodness, we get a little sticker too? Look how cute! This is so exciting because I don't even have an iBook. I've got a lot of other old, vintage Macs, but, oh, and this one is custom, and pink. I could not ask for a better today. Look how incredible this is. This is definitely gonna be a set piece. (gasps) (bright music) So here's the different ports. So this is for the iPad charging and this is for the internal charging. I charged it all up, we've got the magnets on. I love this little detail. He even bought the Kondor blue, the pink iJustine cable to go with this. (laughs) He did say because this is a higher quality cable that it was a little bit difficult to get in here. No worries, we will be able to do it. Oh, it's so awesome. Look at this. There it is! Oh, my gosh, look how cool! I mean, can you even? Like, I'm actually speechless. Okay, let's turn on the keyboard. Look at this! And the final iBook iPad conversion is complete. I mean, this is so creative. It looks so cool, and it's pink. What? There's a light? Oh, that is a treat. Oh, wow. (laughing) It's so cool. So here is the bottom, all custom pink. And I love that this has a little light on it, like, that's so freaking cool. One of the things that I always thought was so interesting about this particular iBook design is the Apple logo is facing you, but then when you open it up, it's facing down, so that's something that Apple has changed in some of their more recent devices. You'll be sitting at coffee shops or you're at work and the Apple logo will actually be right side up. I definitely think that was a smart move on their part. We just need to see it again, I need to show it to you. Look at this stuff, isn't it neat? Okay, we're not done yet, 'cause we have one more little item. Oh, my goodness. Oh, this is so cute. It's a little tiny iBook. Look how cute this is. This is so incredible. It's even got like the little keyboard. How perfect. So hyped. If you guys wanna get more information about this and all of his creations, I will put them in the description below. Now this needs to find a perfect place in my office. I think I found just that. I can alternate this in between my old 1984 Mac. It's gonna look so, so good. Thank you guys for watching, if you haven't already, please hit Subscribe, and be sure to Like this video if you enjoyed it, and leave me a comment below, and let me know what color iBook you would want. See you guys in the next video. Bye. (bright music)",

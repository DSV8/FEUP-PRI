    "transcript": "- Hey, guys, and welcome to This Is Now. Pokemon Sword and Shield come out on the switch today and while it should be one of the most exciting days of the year for Pokemon fans it's more than a little bit bittersweet thanks to some, shall we say controversial decisions on Game Freak's end. Look, for me my love of Pokemon goes deep. I've been playing Pokemon literally since I was like six years old and while the games have been incredible and the games have been great there's no doubt that things have gotten a little stale. Right, I mean there's a very rigid formula in the games and I understand that over the years Game Freak has tried to shake it up and introduce new forms and new, ideas, I don't know, I mean, Mega Evolutions were cool. What was the other thing, what was it after Mega Evolutions? - Z-Moves - Z-Moves, those are dumb. - Yeah, I don like Z-Moves. - Z-Moves are dumb. But now we've got mega-giganto max. You know, I would talk a lot about this right now however I think Pokemon's had lots of really weird, like, some Pokemon, like the way like they evolved and all kinds of stuff or like trying, do you remember try to catch a Feebas? - [Jimmy] Yeah. - That was like the most infuriating thing of any Pokemon game where there's like one tile that changes once a day in one, ugh. But to understand it all we have to go back to the beginning where Sword and Shield were announced back in February of this year. Fans were excited because to combat a negative reaction to the very simplified remake of Pokemon Yellow, Let's Go Eevee and Pikachu, Game Freak wanted to make sure to let everyone know that hey, they're also working on a brand new main line follow-up to Pokemon Ultra Sun and Moon which will be coming out this year. Now that turned out to be a pretty smart move since while the Let's Go games were fun, they end up cutting out a lot. Things like random battles in the wild were removed to make way for a Pokemon Go esque catching encounter, the Pokedex was slash down to the original 151 and there Alolan forms and the entire game was made just generally easier so younger people could find a new entry point into the series. Personally, while it was nice to play realistically we've been to Kanto many, many times and I kind of enjoyed it but I also made it about halfway through the game and haven't touched it in the year since so, it's cool but I don't know, I guess I'm a hardcore Pokemon fan, I'm an old-school Pokemon fan. I wanna actually battle wild Pokemon. I wanna go get my eight gym badges in what's the new region, Galagar? - Galar. - Galar. - Yeah, england. - England! But of course as we all now know things pretty much went downhill for Pokemon Let's Go. So the first controversy to come out of the Pokemon Sword and Shield reveal in February came down to graphics. Now with the jump to new hardware almost three years into its lifecycle fans were rightfully expecting Sword and Shield to be a big leap forward for the franchise. Similar to the jump between Black and White and X and Y. I know while obviously the DS games hung around for quite a while, when you jumped up to 3DS it was like, whoa, look at those graphics, this is revolutionary, it was good. So when the reveal trailer dropped and it made Sword and Shield look like a slightly uprezzed Sun and Moon fans were not happy. So the main meme being used to represent the graphical updates, or rather the lack thereof, was a screenshot of a tree taken from the early area. Now at first people putting it side by side with a picture of a tree from Breath of the Wild and then they put it next to a tree from Ocarina of Time. Yes, putting a tree from Pokemon game released in 2019 next to a tree from a game released in 1998 was an actual comparison people could make. Now to be fair, of course graphics aren't everything and at the end of the day it's gainfully that really matters. But one of the key criticisms against the Pokemon franchise for a long time now is that the games are slowing on adding new features and genre trends. On top of that, most new features like having a Pokemon follow you or Mega Evolutions don't really impact gameplay in a meaningful way and they only tend to be included for one or two games before being replaced with something else. For example instead of Mega Evolutions or Z-Moves, Sword and Shield features Dynamaxing which allows you to battle with a giant hologram of pretty much any Pokemon you want. Now, Nintendo probably made the smart move and didn't really offer much of a response to any of the criticism so it generally died down until around E3. Turning the Treehouse Live presentation of the game Nintendo revealed that like Let's Go, Sword and Shield wouldn't support all 800 plus Pokemon that have been created since Red and Blue. Now this really was the final straw for fans who expected to take advantage of the upcoming Pokemon Home app which is supposed to allow you to freely transfer your Pokemon between games all the way from the digital versions of Red and Blue all the way up to the most recent generation. I mean, that's always been one of the major strengths of the mainline Pokemon games. You've had literally all the Pokemon available. And even though, yes, certain generations such as third gen didn't allow you right out of the box to import older Pokemon, there was at least all the Pokemon data in the game, you could trade them eventually with things like Pokemon Colosseum and Leaf Green and everything but this time around short of some like firmware update the games straight up do not have the data for many of the older Pokemon. between Pokemon Go, Pokemon Let's Go, as well as Sword and Shield all having different sets of usable Pokemon the app really is a holding cell for whenever the games start to support all the old Pokemon again. Now according to Game Freak, the reason for the reduced Pokedex is that the higher graphical fidelity of the Switch allowed them to create a new battle and idle animations which of course takes time to do, especially when you have eight hundred plus Pokemon so they made the sacrifice so that the game will be ready for launch. Or at least so they claim. Of course, fans were immediately dubious of this and in early July a user posted a thread contradicting it. First they showed a clip of the main character speaking with their rival matched up with an animation of the rival from Sun and Moon which is identical. Isn't that slightly suspicious. And then they showed a video of a new Pokemon using Tail Whip which was again the same animation from Sun and Moon. They also compared the Tail Whip animation from Sword and Shield to the original Pokemon Stadium game on N64 and, yeah, it doesn't look great. Now the Dynamax Pokemon also have these same animations as the smaller counterparts but that just slowed down. Now, at this point the internet, not too pleased. And if you can believe in things continue to get even worse as outrage tends to do. On November 4th the Reset Air user Joeski posted a grid featuring every single Pokemon in the National Pokedex with the returning Pokemon highlighted in green. As it turned out Game Freak was absolutely ruthless when deciding which Pokemon they were going to cut. Pretty much every starter aside from Charmander, because of course, didn't make the cut on top of fan favorite legendaries like Mewtwo, Ho-oh, Lugia, all of the legendary birds, even Dragonite didn't make the cut. Man. Now, if we get a little bit deeper into speculation there were a lot of rumors in the early part of the Switch's lifecycle that Game Freak we're going to be remaking the Ultra Sun and Moon games for the Switch, mostly because they're afraid that the Switch wasn't actually going to sell. Now when it became very obvious that the Switch was a big seller it seemed like their sort of strategy got moved around a little bit so Pokemon Let's Go showed up which were admittedly pretty fun games but they're very, very simple. And instead of doing a Ultra Sun and Moon remake they start working on Sword and Shield. Now it makes sense if they had already started prepping sort of moving the 3DS game over to the Switch that they would wanna renovate or reuse a lot of the same models, a lot of the same moves, a lot of the same animations from the Ultra Sun and Moon games. I mean, yes the Switch is obviously much more powerful than 3DS but these games are fairly complicated, remaking 800-plus Pokemon is a lot of work but the downside here is that, yes, it's great to have a new Pokemon game every year but is it really worth it to have something which by all accounts seems to be a little empty? There's lots of cases of like buildings that feel like they totally should be fleshed out, dungeons which are like five minutes long. Like there's so much for this game that seems to be a little bit cut short, it seems like Game Freak just had to rush it out the door. And well it's great because some parts of the game do seem to legitimately be solid, but a lot of the game just seems to be not quite there. That brings us to today, the reviews of Sword and Shield have dropped with some of them calling it the best Pokemon game yet and others calling it a hollow shell of what the franchise once was. But overall to be fair, the scores have been pretty solid with the current Metacritic score of 84%. Game Freak didn't get much time to rest on their laurels though as the game is officially out in the wild now and because of that it has found its way into the hands of data miners. So the statement from Game Freak about the models and animations in Sword and Shield being built from scratch is starting to come back to bite them once again as the data miners were able to pull out the exact models of some of the Pokemon in the game and after comparing them to models pulled from the 3DS games it looks like they are functionally identical. To really drive the point home, here's a video of Scorbunny's third evolution using Double Kick. Not only is it a kind of terrible animation but it's the same one we've been seeing for the past few games in the series. Now all of these videos of course are making their way through Twitter as #GameFreakLied has been the top trend on the platform lately and it's like, man, it's a mess because obviously the internet gets salty, they get upset sometimes. Although to be honest, I actually kind of feel like all this criticism has been pretty similar to a lot of other releases of other Pokemon games. So what exactly makes this so different? Well probably this is because this is the first time we're supposed to get a flagship Pokemon game on a full console, not just a limited handheld. Now, it is good that Game Freak has made some strides like being able to skip the awful tutorials or having an open world when you compare the scale of Pokemon Sword and Shield to something like Breath of the Wild Matt can't help but feel like he was cheated out of his money. I'm curious, do you think the internet is overreacting with this stuff and also let me know exactly how old I am in the comments below by letting me know what your first generation of Pokemon was. Anyway, thank you so much for watching, make sure to hit the like button and subscribe and you can check out some of our other episodes here and here. If you don't actually check out those episodes I'm not sure what will happen because Matt's not here today so he didn't write an outro for me. Although you coulda just given me an ending, everything else is here. I don't have to do without Matt, it's weird. Matt, I miss you, come back, please.",

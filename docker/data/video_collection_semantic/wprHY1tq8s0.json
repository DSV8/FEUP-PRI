    "transcript": "okay oh this this is a little too intense let's turn it down I think this this yeah this looks a little better sweet what's up guys Eber here with Hardware Canucks and it's been a while since I've done one of these vlog series or behind the dam episode at least I feel that for myself because there are a few reasons for that one I've been working on a few projects and number two I've been looking for a perfect camera that can give me a good balance between vlogging and of course exploring the photography side because ever since I switched from my 5d Mark iii to the Canon c100 I've sort of it's I've almost sort of demolished exploring that part I haven't really looked back into photography I mean sure you could capture great stills on your smartphone but I really do miss shooting with my 5d so yeah after spending countless weeks doing my research and watching a lot of YouTube reviews I finally settled on this guy the Canon 80D I've been using this camera for about two months getting a feel for itself and of course shooting a lot of video and photos so you may notice a few mural shots some on previous reviews in the last few months some of them are actually shot on the 80D and you may or may not have noticed a difference between that in the c100 but so far I'm actually really impressed with what this camera is is able to offer so let me walk you through my experience but most importantly my reasoning behind this pic R after message from our sponsor finally an ultra slim body keyboard with mechanical red or blue switches designed and perfected for work and play that the Sorel Graham XS evolved to fit right in check it out below okay so I think it's time to step back for a little bit and talk about the Canon c100 because I've been shooting with this camera for about three or four years and it's been serving me really well I absolutely love this camera it only shoots 1080p video not 4k and for those of you who haven't noticed pretty much all of my hardware connects reviews have been upscaled to 4k and publish to youtube so if you haven't noticed a quality difference between you know my videos and Dimitri's videos let me know the comments down below I'd definitely love to hear your thoughts on that but the problem with the c100 is that it's primarily a cinema camera and not a photography camera so if you're someone who wants to explore both photo and video you won't be able to do that with this c100 but you would be able to do that with a DSLR or mirrorless camera because those type of cameras can shoot both photo and video and coming to think of it I've actually always been passionate about photography and it has been my passion ever since high school but it eventually have liked me to shooting video for hard-working acts and it slowly led me into picking out the c100 and I sort of explore I've started exploring the video settings but I've always wanted to go back into exploring a photography because it is definitely a great way to explore your creative side and a lot of things actually apply or a lot of rules and you learn from the photography side applies to the video side of things and vice versa both of them are not different they're they're kind of exactly the same once you start applying your creative thoughts on both fields are you definitely able to come up with some great results now my camera history is actually a little bit interesting and a lot of you guys might find surprising as well so my very first camera was the Nikon d50 100 and back in the day I used to compare the d50 100 to the Canon t3i I did a lot of research into both cameras and it looked like the t3i was a great option for video while the d50 100 was a great option for stills because it had an it had a post processing center that can literally just take a raw image and process it to a certain effect so if you want selective color or a miniaturized in effect the camera can do that in body without having to do that on a computer which was great so I decided to pick that camera because back in the day I was super passionate about photography but it eventually led me into video and so I was sort of not impressed with the video capabilities D5100 it just had terrible settings you really weren't able to explore the full video side of things especially when controlling was things like shutter speed and aperture it just wasn't that great so I sold my D5100 and I picked up the Canon 5d Mark iii and boy it was it was quite the experience I was able to explore both the photo side of things and the video side of things both feels the camera was just great you were able to control pretty much everything you possibly could with that camera especially on the video side of things and it was the camera that I was Ben I was using in the early days working with hardware connects all the bureau that was shot on my side was with that camera in fact Dmitriy was super jealous because he was shooting with the 5d mark ii fast forward about a year later and I picked up the Canon c100 and it was a whole new game in terms of exploring the video side of things so built-in Indies excel ours zebras Peking and of course getting to explore the super 35 sensor and grading si log was definitely a learning experience I still haven't mastered that part but you know either way I still I still have shooting with this camera but over time as a channel grew we decided to implement a few vlog style segments here and there to add a little bit of dynamic to our personalities and Dimitri has been a master at that himself I'll actually leave a links leave links to a few blocks in the description down below if you want to check it out he's done marvelous works with his GH5 but the c100 is not really ideal for vlogging because if you think about it it's a pretty bulky system and when you add a lens on top of it you're definitely gonna add a lot of weight to the overall system and it just isn't ideal for handheld stuff there's also a lack of shooting slow motion it only shoots 1080p up to 24 frames per second which still looks great by the way you know when you're shooting b-roll but but yeah it for slow motion stuff it just isn't it isn't up for that task another reason is the lack of a flip-out screen so the c100 screen flips odd right about over there so it's pretty hard to review your composition when you're shooting on camp segments so basically what I do every time is I go back to the camera and I flip the screen all the way back and I review my composition and then once it's done I go back to the camera and start recording so it's a two-step process and it is a little bit frustrating but have you I'm used to it already another important factor was the lack of a continuous auto focusing system so the model that I have here doesn't come with the dual pixel motor but Canon does offer a service or at least they did back in the day it was quite expensive was pretty expensive you have to take it you had to take it to a service center to get it upgraded but I just didn't have the time for that and I'm not exactly sure if they still provide that service for the c100 enter the canon 80D it doesn't cost you an arm or a leg like the gh5 but it has one of the best auto focusing systems that you can find on a DSLR body and it's actually one of the reasons why I ended up picking this camera is just for its auto focusing system because I don't have to worry about that when I'm doing the behind the Dan episode and of course when I'm shooting outdoors especially when I'm taking stills I can completely rely on the other focusing system without having to worry about you know making sure my subject or is in focus which is great I also love the lightweight body it's a lot lighter than the c100 that's for sure you can quickly you know pick this up for handheld stuff and once you throw a wide-angle lens I think you're looking at a perfect setup and of course this accepts native EF lens so I don't have to worry about getting adapters of whatnot and that's actually one of the reasons why I skip the gh5 or another system because I'd have to spend another thousand dollars on an adapter to adapt the native EF lens I have right now and of course you'd lose a few more features like you know a good battery life and of course this top little LCD screen because this is something I've always been wanting on a DSLR it's actually a great feature that I'm sure a lot of photographers might miss because if you're shooting in low light or if you're taking if you're going outdoors in the night this is a great way to monitor your sayings like ISO shutter speed and of course are just quick settings this this little L City over here is a fantastic addition and this is something you would definitely miss when you go for something like the gh5 or another mirrorless system lastly I have to talk about the flip out screen because it is an important factor when it comes to vlogging because you want to make sure that your composition is intact and you want to monitor yourself to make sure that you're in focus this is an absolute must-have for a vlogging camera if you're you know looking for a blogging camera in general but also just if you're trying to explore photography so if you want to take a low angle shot so you can flip the screen and you know look at your composition without having to you know completely Bend yourself and do that and it's a it's a lot flexible then you would expect it to be and it comes in very useful in every situation I've taken advantage of this and a lot of times over the past few months especially no exploring outdoors with photography and of course video so yeah definitely a must-have for a vlogging camera no lack of shooting 4k is a bummer but in all honesty that shouldn't hinder you from creating content I'm very happy with the image coming out of the 80D but the c100 is still supreme dudes insane low-light performance and the internal downscaling that takes place so it's basically a 4k sensor down scale to 1080p in camera hence a sharper image and so that's the Canon 80D guys I've obviously done a few modifications like you know masking V branding because I like to keep it as stealth as possible that's just my way but I obviously want to add a few add-ons to make it to sort of build the perfect vlogging setup so first of all foremost I have to get a new lens because I'm thinking of the Canon 10 to 18 millimeter with image stabilization it's it's a 4.5 25.6 lens it costs around $350 Canadian so it's a fairly cheap lens but it should get the job done I did test it out at the local Canon camera shop here in Toronto and it looks like a great add-on for the 80D another thing that I want to get is a proper microphone for the 80D for vlogging I obviously can't rely on a shotgun microphone because it just doesn't work out that well but yeah I'm definitely thinking of picking up a proper microphone so let me know if you have any suggestions when it comes to you know proper lens selection for vlogging of course a microphone setup in the comments down below I'll definitely make sure to check out some of them so I hope you enjoyed this little behind the damn episode and honestly I'm actually really happy with the 80D and I really can't wait to share my or just more vlogs in general with this camera and you know if I'm working on a shot with a scene 105 I want to share my experience you know creating that shot with you guys and talking about the you know the work that goes into it for example lining and whatnot I can now do that with the 80D because I don't have to worry about you know shooting that shot and then talking about that in camera it's a little difficult to do everything with one camera it's always good to have an extra body to you know take it from a different angle so I think that's an excellent option and I think the 80D is a perfect camera in that regard also for those of you wondering I did get my hands on the samsung galaxy s9 overall I'm having mixed feelings about this device I've used it for about four days right now and I'm not impressed with the battery life I've also tested the camera I'm planning on doing some in-depth tests comparing this to the Google pixel - that is sitting right over there and of course compare the cameras because this guy's featuring that variable aperture and you know I'm not sure if it's if it's a big deal but but yeah stay tuned for my long-term review of this device so guys that pretty much wraps up this behind the damn episode let me know your thoughts on the canon 80D and is this a perfect alternative to something like the gh5 or another mirrorless camera and if you want me to do a full extensive review on the Canon 80D once again let me know in the description or comments down below on Ebert with Hardware Canucks thank you so much for watching and we'll see you in the next one",

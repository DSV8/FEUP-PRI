    "transcript": "- Hello, testing, testing, one, two, three. We have a new MacBook in the house. Also a new mic because mine is still packed and I didn't feel like unpacking my gear. I just got back from traveling and as I got home, UPS arrived at the same time. It was such a beautiful moment with my new space black, fully specked out M3 Max MacBook Pro. So let's open this up. Check it out. I know I already did an initial review, but I wanted to just show you guys the 14 inch in comparison to the 16 inch and oh, I'm just so excited because this is my personal device and I can finally set it up, edit and get going. (box bangs) (tapes screeching) Oh you beautiful, beautiful machine. You are so sweet. I can't wait! The space black is so beautiful and I'm so excited for this new look. Did I hit record up there? She did. (tapes screeching) Ugh, I'm so excited! Like, it's exciting opening up the review units, but when it's my very, very own, so much more exciting. Here it is. Beautiful little MacBook. (plastic cover rustling) Check it out. Oh yeah. It's so light. It's so powerful. I cannot wait to plug everything that I possibly can into this, until it yells at me and says, \"Sorry, you have maxed it out.\" Got our charger, matching MagSafe. Now let's open it up. (upbeat music) So beautiful. Man, the space black, this is just, it's like a whole vibe. So I have another little something to unbox. I unfortunately left my fanny pack in a car in New York when I was there for the Apple events and my new USB-C AirPods were in there and I'm so sad. So I ordered another pair, but I'm hoping to get them back because the guy said he's gonna return it to a hotel today that my sister happens to be staying at New York. So, fingers crossed that he actually does, 'cause I did pay him money up front before he dropped the bag. So I'm hoping that he follows through on his promise. But just in case AirPods are life. So I ordered a new pair. These ones I got engraved. I actually forget what I engraved, I think I did a pig. We're gonna find out. Can you guys imagine how sick matte black AirPods would be? Think about it. - [Bot] Use English as the main language. Press the return key. - I wasn't ready for you. I'm doing something else right now. Oh, it is, it's a little pygmy emoji! Oh my God, it's so cute. Look at it. (laughs) Yeah. Super cute. Ooh, new USB-C cable, we love that. I forgot that that comes with it, so thoughtful. Swap out those ear tips for the extra small. It's still so wild to me that I have not been able to use any AirPods until they made this extra small ear tips, like, finally, they work in my ears. It's truly a magical experience now. That'd be really funny if I ordered the wrong ones and I didn't order USB-C, but I, 2nd gen, I hope you are USB-C. (laughing) Oh gosh, I ordered them in such a panic, I didn't pay attention. I'm a liability. Shining, shimmering, absolutely splendid. (upbeat music continues) Oops, she stepped on something, she's back. We've got our space gray previous Mac and we've got our brand new 16 inch M3. Look at this family! You need a little light on you there. It really is pretty wild how light this is compared to the space gray, although in this light this looks exactly the same because this light is very, very bright. But when we take this to the top down, you'll see the difference. This poor MacBook, like, it's not even a year old and it has been through so much. So, here they are, next to each other and then we've got the big boy. Like, look at that. You are having trouble focusing, I've noticed. What is your problem? Manual focus, you're in. The 16, so you can see the size difference. I mean that's a significant chunk. Like, that's like a small Olive Garden breadstick right there and Olive Garden breadsticks are a pretty decent size. But I would say that that's about a breadstick-size size difference. That is a scientific measurement if I've ever heard one. So this is kinda just a short little video unboxing and showing you kinda the size differences between the 14 and the 16 and the color difference with the space gray. Let me see what else I have. Do I have anything else for you? I thought this was silver, but this is also a space gray MacBook. This is the blue and we've also got the gold. I need a silver. I return with another Mac. This is super old. This one's so old that this still has the light-up logo, but that's kind of like a little silver reference. We've got a lot of stuff going on here and it's also very hard to see in this lighting. So you can see if I lift this up, you can see the blue color (upbeat music continues) and this gold looks very silver to me. Simply hold this over here in this realm and this is a starlight, actually. Gang's all here. I'd love to hear from you guys though. What is your favorite color that the MacBooks come in? I am a huge fan of the space gray, so I'm very excited, this has now joined the family. Although now I've got like, all this titanium, I just got the titanium aura ring, I've got the titanium Apple Watch and they do look really nice together though, so that's great. Well, thank you guys for watching. If you wanna watch some more videos, I'll put them here on the end screen and of course, if you wanna check out my M3 review with the iMac and the new space gray MacBook, I'll put that here at the end as well. And if there's anything that you'd like to see me test out in a future video, because I will be doing a follow up, doing some more testing and of course, once I get all of my apps and projects on here, it'll be really fun to see how fast this really is in comparison to my previous M2 MacBook. I'll see you guys in the next video. Bye. (beeps) (gentle music) Oh, you're, okay. You're like stuck solid. Who are you? I'm confused. Nothing, I just don't even know anymore. What have I gotten myself into?",

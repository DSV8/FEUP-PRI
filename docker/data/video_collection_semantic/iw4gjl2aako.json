    "transcript": "- Is it just me? Something looks a little different today. - We got new camera! (Austin woots) (Goku screaming) (production beeps) Hello, and welcome to \"This is\". Is streaming finally coming to gaming in a way that replace a console you can't get your hands on - Wait, wait. Wait, no. - because even though consoles have been out for several years now, and I'm talking about next-gen consoles and not just regular consoles, but finally gonna be able to do it? - This is not the video, Matt. This is not the streaming video. - It is the streaming video because I wrote it! Or actually, Kinsey wrote it, but I'm gonna take credit for it because that's what happens when you're the boss! - I am the boss. - Oh, God. - (laughs) You fell for it! - I did. I didn't walk, I ran. I ran into that one. - Mm. (production beeps) In the news recently, we've seen a lot of rumors about a brand new piece of Xbox hardware. It's the Series Stream, after literally years of speculation that Microsoft is going to create a streaming stick. - So the form factor for this would be a little Roku-style stick. I imagine it's gonna be like Chromecast where it might have one of those kind of combination power plugs that might have a wired jack. - And I think that actually would be important because I think when it comes to streaming games, good wifi is fine, but any kind of latency, any kind of extra complication you can remove from the chain is always gonna make it better. And it would be very surprising to me if they sell a streaming stick that does not have at least the option of using wired internet for that better latency and that more responsive experience. - We often get comments like, \"My internet is too slow for this.\" We are here to tell you that your internet is probably just fine. You know, someone's watching this video in 240p and screaming at the phone right now, right? (chuckles) - Yeah, because look, look. I'm not gonna sit here and pretend streaming gaming is gonna be a better experience than playing on a console at home, if not. The reason I think this is so important to the gaming industry is not because it's gonna replace having a console, but because it's one, supplemental. This would be a great thing to travel around, throw in your bag. The other part is this is gonna be cheap. I could see this being 100 bucks tops. - I mean, you can find Rokus and Chromecasts typically in that 30, $40 range pretty easily. - Microsoft has said time and time again, they don't care how you play Xbox. They just want you into the ecosystem. This opens up a lot of options for gamers who couldn't afford even the $300 Series S. - Of course, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it makes sense, right? There are a ton of ways to do this, but the whole in the market right now is if you do not own an Xbox console of any kind and you still wanna play on a TV, you wanna play games as they were meant to be experienced. - Yes. - And for that, I think something like this makes sense. Will it be a massive, huge hit? Probably not, but my main question with this is why does Microsoft have to create the custom hardware? Why could this not be an app for a Roku or for a Chromecast or even for smart TVs, right? That would be my first sort of question because unless Microsoft has some secret sauce built into the actual hardware that would help to cut down on the latency, if there's something like that, this hardware I think could make sense. But it does seem to me like there's no real reason for Microsoft to create a piece of hardware, unless maybe it is like an actual set-top box, and it could completely replace your Roku or your Chromecast or whatever, and you watch 4K videos and everything like that. This conversation made more sense in 2017, when the hardware was potentially coming out and whatnot, but now- - You mean when we had this conversation and everything I said would happen is happening, and that's why we're doing this video again? Yeah, you're right. Why can't it be an app? - Yeah. - Well, it can, and it's going to be. So Samsung TVs are gonna be making an app on there. - For specifically for Game Pass Ultimate or for the streaming side of things. Well, that makes sense 'cause I mean GeForce Experience for example is on LG TVs and whatnot. This is already becoming a thing. - But to answer your question, why do we need a streaming stick? Because I do think they will have a little bit of that secret sauce in there. - Okay. - So I think that one, if you have a dedicated video encoder, well, I guess decoder, you can get a little bit better video quality out of this versus something that could be built into a TV. I know they're experimenting with H.266 video codec, which is a fraction of the size of a typical video right now, even on YouTube. So right now, it's around 20 megabits to have a decent experience over there. - That's 1080p, 60 is what they recommend - Yeah. for 20 megabits. - But with H.266, that could be something four or five megabit without losing quality. However, it's a very CPU-intensive decoding process. - Yeah, lot of bits you gotta unpack and repack. - Yeah, some devices are still having trouble with H.265. So H.265 is still kind of being spread out. - Yeah. - for video codecs, which is great quality for low file sizes. With H.266, they've been experimenting with it, it's astronomically low file sizes for how much quality you're getting. So if you have a streaming stick that has a dedicated chip in there or something like whatever video codec they're using, - Yeah. - you can get a better video quality than what you're gonna get in a standard smart TV. Will it actually be 4K? Probably not because I mean, - Well, it could. - we're not even getting true 4K in a lot of games locally. The big challenge when we talk about latency, it's how far away are you from the data center. Disclaimer, we live pretty close to one of these Xbox data centers. There's one in LA. When I'm playing these games, I don't really have latency issues. However, someone who lives far away from them, your usage will vary. - Yeah. - People are like, \"Oh, I VPN into it. It's not available in my country, so I've VPN into it. And it was trash.\" The reason it's not available in your country yet is because there isn't a data center there. I've been saying this for two years now. Streaming is good enough for a decent experience for a lot of people. - Sure. - Do you wanna go play \"Call of Duty\" on this? Probably not. You're definitely gonna be at a disadvantage with latency because again, it's always gonna be a little bit behind. But for single player games, this is a really good experience. I played my entire \"Halo\" campaign laying in bed. - The thing about this is it does seem like there's gonna be some Xbox streaming stick, right? And obviously, a big reason why you would want to subscribe to Xbox Game Pass, specifically the Ultimate version, is that not only do you get all kinds of games for your PC and for your Xbox, but you'll also get the access of playing those same games and all your synced saves and whatnot on mobile device or wherever you are, right? But as with all these things, it needs to contribute to the bottom line, right? - Yeah. - Microsoft's whole goal, really it feels like with Xbox and gaming, is to drive subscriptions of Game Pass, right? That is what they care about probably more so than how many Xboxes they sell. - Yep. - Probably more so than how many studios they have or whatever. The more people who are paying them 10 or $15 a month, that is an investment in the future for Microsoft, right? They want to build up that gaming ecosystem. And if this is part of that sort of nexus of different options, I think it makes a lot of sense. For me, when we're talking about Xbox, one of the things that's a little bit more exciting, because while cloud gaming is great and it definitely has its place, it is certainly not the way that I typically choose to play games, right? - No. - Would be the Series S side of this equation. I still firmly believe that people are sleeping on the Xbox Series S. One of the biggest complaints I think that people have with the Series S isn't actually the performance. It's the fact that you can't play physical games. The physical game side on Xbox is really important. You can do a lot with your old discs. - [Matt] Yeah, and especially after a couple weeks ago when the authentication servers were down and people couldn't play their digital games, that was a massive problem. - Yeah. - And that's gonna be definitely something that Xbox is gonna have to kind of to work to rectify. - Mm-hm. - Now there is a lovely little patent that they've submitted that would allow for physical games - Yeah. - to be authenticated digitally. So what the patent suggests is that you'd be able to link another Xbox with a disc drive. Basically put your drive in there, - Right. - and then use it as a disc drive to authenticate it. It's just a patent, so we don't know all of it, but the fact that they are thinking of ways to do this- - Well, also, I think it's important for the future 'cause obviously, Series S is the console that does not have a disc drive today. And they did briefly sell the Xbox One SAD, the all-digital edition back before the new Series consoles were out. But I would be very surprised if the next, next generation, whether it's the Series X Mark Two or whatever, I'll be very surprised if they are still using discs in any meaningful way. They may have an option, but I feel it'll mostly be digital at that point. - Again, this is a conversation that keeps bringing up, and people are like, \"I like having my physical disc. I like having my collection.\" But- - Just get a USB disc drive. It's not that difficult. - Yeah. - Sell the PS5 all-digital or PS6 all-digital, and then instead of spinning another $100 to have the disc drive built in, charge me 50 bucks or 80 bucks to have an external drive. I plug it in. I, if I want to use my physical disc, just plug it in like no problem. - The argument for having physical disc is just becoming, for me harder and harder to justify. It's a totally valid thing to say, \"I like having my discs.\" - Sure, of course. I own Nintendo games. Nintendo games very rarely, even with the Switch, do I download them because Nintendo turns off their servers. - Switch is a little different because a lot of Switch games are on the disc. But on Xbox and PS5, most of the games not on the disc. - Well, I, generally speaking, trust Sony and Microsoft to run a competent online service where I can purchase and download my games for a very long time to come. I don't trust Nintendo for that. - Is this streaming stick a solution for everyone? No, is someone who's looking at the streaming stick cross-shopping maybe a Series S? They're definitely not cross-shopping a Series X. - Yeah. - This would be something that I can afford 300 bucks to get in, which is a large chunk of gamers. - Mm-hm. - So what Xbox would need to do to make this work is expand their data centers. A lot of the market that wouldn't be able to afford this are in countries that don't have data centers already. - Mm-hm. - Of course, internet is always gonna be a problem, but I don't think it's nearly as much of a problem as people tend to think it is. So we have some stats here that is gonna shock and appall some people. 88% of households - In the United States, specifically. - have access to gigabit offerings of internet. I'm gonna qualify that. I think that's in general. So one thing I had said to you was something that we could start implementing 5G rollout in homes immediately. - I mean, this is becoming more of a thing. It's still I think very much niche, and would be surprised if it's more than a couple percent of people who use 5G as their home internet. - Right, but in a very short amount of time, internet speeds have sped up astronomically - Yeah. - across the board. Now obviously, your individual speeds, we can't talk for everyone, - Mm-hm. - but across the board where people have access to, has gotten astronomically larger in a really short amount of time. So if you were able to play xCloud on your phone and have that be your main form of entertainment, you have access to good internet on your phone. - If you can sit around and watch TikToks and YouTube on your phone for six hours a day, this internet streaming of your Xbox games would probably take up less bandwidth than that. - At 1080, 60, this is in fact less bandwidth than watching 4K YouTube, for the record. - Oh, by a lot. Yeah. - By almost double. if you're sitting here watching this video, you definitely have enough data to play xCloud. - And if you're watching this at 144p right now- (audio crackles) - Is the streaming stick a replacement for anything? No, but again, it just opens up new opportunities for new gamers. You say it's not gonna be that popular. I think it's gonna be more popular than you think because according to Xbox, 10 million players have been streamed games through xCloud. - What percentage of those players actually try it once versus actually regularly use the service? - We don't have that data, but 10 million is way more than I would've expected. - Matt is so excited about cloud gaming. There are a few topics on \"This is\" that Matt gets- - I'm excited for people to have access to things. I don't know why people are so against new things. - New things? Matt, everyone knows new things are bad and old things are good! - \"The only way people can enjoy games is the way I enjoy games, which is on a $3,000 PC. PC master race! No one's allowed to have fun on games, except the way I wanna do it.\" No, some people wanna have a cheap gaming experience that's casual. Streaming services are a good option for a low-cost investment. - I apologize that you just had to sit through however many minutes of Matt ranting. But thank you very much for watching! Make sure to subscribe to the channel to help support Matt's incredible enthusiasm. And until next time, we will catch you on a even more happy special episode where I drink another BOSS Coffee inevitably. I'm out though, so the video's over. (catchy music)",

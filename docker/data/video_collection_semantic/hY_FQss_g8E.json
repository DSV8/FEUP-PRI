    "transcript": "[Music] in this box is an Alienware laptop so massive it comes with its own gravitational feel and in today's video we're gonna tear it open to have a look at its insides yeah oh and then we're gonna game on it [Music] that is very interesting packing material it's just like Savaged sheets of cardboard that's pretty cool I've never seen that before and then there is some laptop already look at that under that hidden in some more Haystack we have the power brick which oh it's a big boy this Titan of a power brick pumps out 16.9 amps clearly the mothership is hungry for power oh this Behemoth is the Alienware m18x in combination with its mild depth an 18.4 inch display dwarfed on all sides by bezel it makes a 15.6 inch laptop look like a toy for babies and a lot more practical I mean surely a PC built into the side of a mountain would be more portable than this thing it is obscenely massive for a laptop oh wait actually I think the official term is desktop replacement obviously the most important question we need to answer about this laptop is can you open it with one hand I'd be really surprised if you couldn't because it doesn't really have an excuse for you not to be able to but let's have a look yeah you just about can wow putting your hands over this keyboard makes you feel like you're a child but an interesting keyboard it's got a surprising amount of travel but I guess it makes sense considering that the laptop is three miles thick now of course with a laptop of this immense size it does come with a numpad so you can role play as a data enterer the huge size of the laptop makes the trackpad seem comically tiny and by modern standards it is very small even by much smaller laptop standards hinting at its gamer pedigree we've got some macro keys on the side of the keyboard I love how the 18.4 inch display manages to look tiny on this laptop amongst all the bezel wow there is a strong smell of car interior cleaning chemical in here now as you've hopefully been able to tell up until this point with a combination of the weird Farmhouse packaging combined with what seems to be several pounds of person cheese on the keyboard deck the 17 feet across bezels and the dents in the top metal plate this is not a new laptop I bought it refurbished off of eBay and it not being new means it has fascinating specs starting off with IO which has dated it quite a bit we do have an HDMI port but next to that is a firewire port with two USB ports and a just full plethora of audio jacks that's pretty cool on this side we get two more USB ports an ethernet port a DVD drive which again dates it quite a bit and an SD card slot on a side note back in 2013 this base model cost almost 3 000 US Dollars new which adjusted for inflation is almost 4 000 in today's money for the base model and then eye watering price doesn't even include the cost of the mule you have to rent to move this thing around for you around the back there's a whole bunch of heatsink peeking out which makes sense considering that this has two graphics cards in it which I think means we should open it up and have a look on the bottom there's this small plug with some alien on it that's quite a nice touch wait a minute is that a glory hole on a Dell product um that's all there's like three screws that you undo and then you can very easily remove this bottom plate and then you get access to the SSD which you can upgrade the RAM where we actually get dual Channel raminus configuration very excited but you also get access to the battery [Music] you can just lift it out like that look at that that's so exciting and then over here you can even remove your DVD drive and replace that with something else once it's broken and then if you want to go deeper it's pretty easy to do as well you don't even need to undo any screws you just kind of pop it out with a thing and then you have access to all of your fans all three of them which are quite easy to replace as well it's just three screws holding them in and then under here we also have access to an SSD slot which I don't think that's m.2 the spacing in the connector looks wrong at this point as you can tell from my wildly flailing hands I went on a long unhinged rant about what is it with modern laptops that you need to undo 7 million screws and break the fabric of the universe to get access to the inside which is just filled with a bunch of solder down crap what happened to the upgrade glory hole and how have we gone this far backwards in 10 years but I'm sure you're not interested in that so we'll move swiftly on before I tear Down Deeper I do want to test it because we're gonna have to do some pretty major surgery to get the motherboard out and stuff and considering that this is a refurbished eBay model I do want to test it and see if it's working before I potentially break it so I'm gonna reassemble it now test it and then I'll do the deeper tear down later on which through the power of time travel you get to see right now oh we've got some mxm peeking through under there which has gotten me inappropriately excited and after removing the rest of the fans and the Blu-ray Drive I started on doing all the screws I could find and then flipped the laptop around to try and penetrate through the other side which went well oh nothing there we go oh so this is the the keyboard base this is our track pad both of which is replaceable and they connect to this bit of PCB which is like a Fan Hub but for keyboard and trackpad basically this is our SD card reader so I think this is our power button and on this side it's like the LEDs telling you if it's powered up or not so that's what all of that does and then down here is the insides of it which are pretty spectacular quite frankly for the slide GTX 765s that we have in here they each have their own cooling solution and they are action actually on mxm boards so these are upgradable if you want to do that which very very cool and I think the CPU may also be socketed now I'm going to start off by removing one of the gpus so I'm going to start off with this one for no particular reason interestingly I think this ribbon cable is the SLI cable that connects the two gpus that's very cool to see in a laptop it's like an SLI bridge but for laptop gpus and with just a medium struggle it popped free and that is the back of our GTX 765m module this is some of the two gigs of video memory and above that is the mxm connector this teeny bit of heat spreader looks like it's contacting the back of video memory or maybe the power delivery and then this little chunk is our cooling for it on this side you can see that it makes more contact without power delivery and stuff so let's remove the heatsink and have a closer look at the actual PCB oh yeah that just clipped out of the way and then there's a little graphics card oh that thermal paste is Sahara dry this is a pretty cool solution to GPU upgradability in a laptop it's a shame it was abandoned in a McDonald's playpen at such an early age the power delivery and the tiny SLI connector are just so cute it's crazy that this is just one of two Kepler gpus in this laptop [Music] compared to the GPU removal the CPU heatsink required just a hair more shouting look at that heatsink not only is it physically huge for a laptop CPU heatsink but it's also copper look at that wow this is like my retirement right here this bit of heatsink and that's used to cool our i7 4700 HQ I think and it is socketed which again is amazing for a laptop let me remove that and have a closer look [Music] can see on the back it's PGA because the pins are on the CPU as opposed to the socket thermal paste is very dry going by what the thermal paste application looks like on this side I think this is the factory application from like nine years ago so no wonder it's a bit dry so now that we've seen how lusciously modular the inside of this old Alienware laptop is let's see if it works and then try game on it [Music] I am very curious to see how this thing is going to run considering that we have slide graphics cards in here the power button is weirdly hot yes it works very good I really don't know what kind of driver compatibility we're gonna have for the two graphics cards so let's see ooh The Last Driver is from 2019. luckily the geriatric driver installed with little effort and it seemed like turning on SLI was pretty straightforward so disable SLI is on by default so I guess maximize 3D performance SLI enabled oh okay so it's as easy as just pressing a button but let's see if that actually translates into more performance I am very excited about the whole SLI in a laptop thing I think that's pretty cool currently we have it turned off so we've just got the top GPU running and this is with GTA running a 1080p normal settings and with that this is actually a surprisingly similar result as we got from the Apu in the previous video so that's quite interesting I mean they they pretty much exactly line up in terms of performance it does not have that standard laptop symptom of SpaceX rocket at takeoff yeah it's surprisingly quiet actually but it makes sense it is a physically huge laptop with not a whole lot of power draw happening but yeah with GTA 5 let's turn on the second GPU and see what it does [Music] whoa that's pretty much doubled the frame rate okay well now that I've set off it is a reasonable amount less than double now oh that's not the best performance scaling going from one to two gpus if I'm honest in fact according to the standardized Benchmark we just got a 56 increase in performance which only got worse with the other games but it wasn't all bad as far as I can tell we don't have noticeable like micro stutter issues and stuff like that uh which is something that is apparently also very common with multi-gpu setups now granted we do just have a 60hz monitor so maybe I can't see any of the issues now with cs go at 1080p competitive settings uh the frame rate is kind of all over the place at the moment it's very high but at certain points it does dip down quite a lot but here it feels good although the display isn't very good gaming laptop displays have come a long way in the last nine years since this laptop came out okay um so with cs go it's not making a very big difference is it it really wasn't turning on the second GPU only added about 39 more performance oh the single GPU Battlefield 5 at low settings 1080p is not having a great time we're actually getting a worse performance than the igpu in the AMD system from the previous video but maybe adding a second GPU will help so now that we have full power activated it has led to um ex exactly the same gaming performance in fact when I did the standardized Benchmark if anything with SLI enabled it actually performs worse because of the one and 0.1 percent lows that's not very good so at the end of the day this old Leviathan may have a magnificent Hardware configuration 10 years after its launch depending on the game it struggles to keep up with a hundred dollar igpu isn't progress amazing aside from all of the soldering down antics you know what else is amazing subscribing to this channel an act that's guaranteed to increase your system's RGB Luminosity by at least 39 give it a try and until the next video bye-bye [Music] foreign [Music]",

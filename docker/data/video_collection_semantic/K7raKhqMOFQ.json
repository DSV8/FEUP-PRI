    "transcript": "- If tech news is like coffee, then this show is like a caramel macchiato. I will not elaborate, that'd be such a latte thing to do. AMD has confirmed reports that its graphics tuning utility, Radeon Software, has been overclocking some users' Ryzen CPUs without asking permission. - [Crew Member] Rude. (host blowing) - If you're thinking that sound, (host blowing) free performance with even less work on my end sounds great, well then, you probably should catch up on the whole consent thing ASAP. (crew member laughing) But you should also be aware that while every Ryzen CPU supports overclocking, actually doing it voids the CPU's warranty, what about the 5800X3D, that doesn't support overclocking? - [Crew Member] Well, I guess that one doesn't. - Not to mention potential system damage if your hardware doesn't have suitable cooling. Radeon Software has had the ability to automatically overclock CPUs for over a year but it was an opt in feature. Thankfully AMD has confirmed that the forced overclocking is due to a bug that will be fixed shortly, not an intentional change, they're not like Microsoft. Until the patch comes through though, you might wanna disable any active GPU profiles in Radeon Software, unless you like living dangerously like me, I overclock everything. Speculation about what effect Elon Musk may have on Twitter ran rampant when the world's richest man bought a 9.2% stake in the social platform on Monday, but we didn't have to wait long to see the first fruits of that decision. On Tuesday, Elon was added to Twitter's board of directors and was welcoming tweets by the company's CEO and its founder Jack Dorsey. The day before, Musk had tweeted a poll asking if users wanted an edit button to which the overwhelming answer was, \"Uh, yeah.\" (crew member laughing) - [Crew Member] Yeah, we do. - And right after he was added as a board member, Twitter confirmed that their April Fool's Day tweet about working on an edit button wasn't actually a joke, obviously, (host blowing) you felt for that? - [Crew Member] Come on. - Interestingly, the platform also rolled out a change causing deleted tweets embedded in news articles to disappear, before, this was a way to preserve them, maybe Elon had nothing to do with these changes, but what if he did? What's next? To keep your Twitter account, everyone must repost one cringe Reddit meme a week? - [Crew Member] You're required to participate. - You must make your eyes laser eyes. (crew member laughing) And Epic Games officially launched Unreal Engine 5 at their State of Unreal Keynote yesterday and naturally showed off all sorts of fancy looking demos that made me sad when I looked up from my monitor, realized I wasn't actually piloting a spaceship. - [Crew Member] This time. - The whole earth is a spaceship and I'm not piloting it yet, very much not, that's Jeff Bezos. Epic pointed out some easier to use developer tools like the RealityScan mobile app which lets you bring real world objects into Unreal Engine by taking a bunch of photos of them with your phone, can you scan yourself in? Scientists still aren't sure, it's a grandfather of paradox. Epic also confirmed that Square Enix and CD Projekt RED will be using Unreal Engine 5 for the next Tomb Raider and Witcher games instead of their own game engines and well, knowing Epic, that's probably due to being paid wads of cash and not because the engine is great, it could be great though, and then meta humans are looking nice, especially those matrix ones, I like the leather and the 90s glasses. - [Crew Member] That's so James. - Can't wait to get in the metaverse and meet them all. - [Crew Member] Probably really nice. - If Keanu's in the metaverse, does he know he's in the metaverse? - I've been waiting for you, no, you're breathtaking. - Now, sorry for the quick bits brought to you by Vessi, maker of footwear known for being lightweight, ease of pack, comfortable, and most importantly waterproof. I put mine in the washing machine, imagine that, Vessi's Everyday Move shoes are perfect for those on the move whether that's over regular old ground or more moist terrain. They've got enhanced breathability, added support, a convenient pull tab, vegan-swayed lace cages, extra midsole cushioning, and of course the same waterproof Dyma-tex technology that's gonna make you wanna wear 'em every damn day, even inside, depending on your household's indoor shoes policies, Americans, huh, Seinfeld, huh? So keep your feet dry and save 25 bucks with our offer code techlinked at Vessi.com/techlinked. Gotta keep the bits quick, they do not like waiting. - [Crew Member] Hey. - Vevo, the music video hosting company that you see on YouTube all the time was hacked yesterday by Spanish-speaking, criminal group, (speaking in foreign language) who replaced videos from big name artists like Ariana Grande, Drake, Eminem, and more with a video of Paco Sanz, a Spanish man who lied about having terminal cancer. Vevo managed to regain control, wait, is he behind this or is this just a meme? - [Crew Member] No, I think they're making fun of him. - Okay, Vevo managed to regain control and restore the videos but the reason for the hack is still unclear. I think Pelaos can mean something like butt bald and Paco is bald, so that's funny. - [Crew Member] Nice one. - Maybe. - [Crew Member] We get this. - In other Eurocentric news, Germany's central office for combating cybercrime AKA ZIT, ZIT, and the country's federal police said they had seized the servers of the world's biggest cybercrime forum known as Hydra, you can't make this up unless you already did in the 60s because you're Marvel, 80s? The dark website has been operating since 2015 and have been involved in laundering around $5 billion of stolen funds. No doubt another Hydra head will grow back eventually, that's what they do but for now I think ZIT is justified in feeling a little Herculean. - [Crew Member] Do you get Herculean? - Who be soft? Ubisoft has announced they will release no more updates for 2017's Ghost Recon Breakpoint. Months after announcing the title as this sole game in which the company's quote NFTs could be purchased and used. (crew member laughing) - [Crew Member] Whoopsie. - And those last forever, but don't worry crypto gamers, Ubisoft says Quartz is still happening we swear, and it'll be implemented in future games, maybe even a new Ghost Recon and maybe you can bring those NFTs you bought into that game, you might not have wasted your money, we got our fingers crossed for you. - [Crew Member] Hope, maybe it'll turn out for the best. - A couple more here, there we go. In other crypto and also Jack Dorsey news, he tweeted out an image of what many are assuming is the hardware crypto wallet being developed by his company, Block. Along with the photo, Jack simply wrote, \"Rocky,\" probably because the wallet kind of looks like a rock, if you're interested though, you might wanna hold your horses, 'cause Block just confirmed that an ex-employee got away with downloading user data. For me, I'm gonna say, \"No, thanks to Rocky, I'll take Bullwinkle instead.\" This is a stupid joke. - You like that one? - You should be blocked. - [Crew Member] 'Cause it's a fun cartoon. - OpenAI announced the second iteration of its DALL-E text-to-image generation system which creates stunningly coherent images based on text descriptions. So you can tell it to create an image of an astronaut riding a horse in space or doing literally anything and DALL-E will do it in various artistic styles, the styles of Salvador Dali, even? Surrealist, ah, the latest version allows you to replace individual elements of a scene, so you can be even more aware of our limits as fleshy water bags, I can't do that. - [Crew Member] Try. - Racers don't work that well, they always leave a mark. I can tell you to come back on Friday for more tech news, we'll have a much better analogy for non-coffee people then. - [Crew Member] \"TechLinked\" is like- - Tea, now we recorded at four o'clock and then comes out a couple hours later.",

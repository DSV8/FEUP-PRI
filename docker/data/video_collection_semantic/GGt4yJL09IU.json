    "transcript": "Okay the office tour that no one asked for hey How's it going Dave2D here and this is a tour of my office now? This isn't my studio. This isn't where I shoot my youtube videos normally It's actually my home, and this is like the office space in my house now. It's a very small space This isn't like glamorous or anything like that and it's very functional I didn't curate this scene to make it look extra cool or anything. This is literally how I work Originally this room was meant to have two setups one for my wife one for myself But because I just have so much crap it ended up being my office so right now, we have two set ups Let's start off with this one over here this is the Mac setup, I would say that this is the one that I use the most frequently when it comes to working on YouTube stuff just because I like the Mac OS System for just my personal use so we have the ten core Mac Pro. This is a 2013 Mac Pro I would love to use the iMac in here but it's just way too expensive to really justify the cost for myself and The big reason for me is I much prefer the widescreen stuff when it comes to content creation It's really difficult for me To switch from something wide like this to a regular sixteen by nine panel that you see on the iMac Pro this is running a ten core CPU 64 gigs of ram and we have your standard kind of Mac input devices the Apple keyboard Apple trackpad and actually this is not the Apple Mouse. This is the Logitech MX Anywhere 2 s great Mouse And this is something that is just really clean really simple gets the job done now in terms of the accessories that I uses this thing I Don't have speakers on this thing so this monitor the LG 308UC99 Fantastic monitor it has speakers built-in so I often use that but if I need something that's a little more private I use air pods with this particular setup, and we have a boost ball for people that know anything about adidas boost and then we have just a standard four gigabyte backup Drive that I use This is a Bluetooth speaker from Nixon not particularly great, but I got it for free I like it so I use it and that basically wraps up this area. No. There's one last thing it's the Belkin wireless charging pad, which I use if I'm using the ten in this area the Tables are desks. Whatever you want to call these things. They are from West Elm. I forget the name I'll find the link and put it in the video description I'll link all the stuff in the video description if you guys are interested okay moving along we have the PC setup now I purposefully chose to Cripple my PC set of people that follow my channel know that I lack self-control when it comes to playing games So this thing is a powerful PC for video editing But the thing is those devices are often very good for playing games. I feel like I've had gaming peripherals this thing would not be used for work very much I would just be playing games all the time so What I've done is actually have wireless keyboard and a wireless mouse and these peripherals are actually great for just regular work and productivity But they're not ideal for playing games and when I do play games like I don't try to play competitively on these so this is the drive Oh caliber keyboard great wireless keyboard RGB Backlighting with switchable key caps and these are the cyan key caps from GM k and we have the MX master 2 SMS so these Devices are great for a Productivity just what I want to do with this thing but they aren't perfect for competitive gaming so the mousepad is a SteelSeries white mouse pad and The pc itself if you've seen my older video on the hype beast supreme pc This is that machine, but I've stripped the red paint because it was just getting a little too obnoxious and again I did that PC for fun. I'm not like huge on supreme, but it's cleaned up a little bit There are some parts that I couldn't remove the paint as cleanly But I really like this case it's the Loki ghost s1 case And I just decided to use that for this particular setup ok the monitor is an alienware 34 inch curved screen the reason why I'm using this monitor is it's 120 Hertz g-sync, it's a fantastic gaming monitor But it's also one of the few gaming waters that are Super super color accurate this thing's basically is color accurate as any monitor that are own for content creation so to round up this area We have a backup drive. This is the Seagate 8 terabyte drive. I really like this thing one cable no, AC adapter the USB C plugs up right to your PC or your laptop or your Mac whatever and single cable backup Ps4 which I occasionally use input into this thing and this is I've never actually done a video on this thing But this is the MIDI fighter 64 from DJ tech tools You've probably seen videos from like Sean sabe that have done some crazy stuff with this I picked this up to just have fun with it and potentially make some music for intros and stuff like that But I haven't gone round to doing much with it Yes, okay, if you'll notice neither of these setups actually have speakers, so I'm actually running wireless headphones on both So you saw the air pods on that and this one I'm running the B&O wireless headphones what you use for video editing and some Casual gaming. It's some nice wireless headphones. Okay moving along. I did it for you anything here, No okay moving along backpack I'll probably do a video like a what's my backpack video in the future but Moving on to this side so this area here is where I do like charging, I guess It's not really a charging area But I just place my phones here and other devices that need to be charged so the phones I'm using right now we have the pixel to excell the 1 + 5 t and the iPhone 10 if I had to choose one that I use the Most frequently right now is probably iPhone 10. Just goes my family and friends most of them are on, iOS We have batteries so the battery packs that I'm using right now are Ankur battery packs. This isn't sponsor or anything They're literally the ones that I've purchased both of these they're both pretty beefy ones 20,000 milliamps the others 10,000 milliamps And the bigger ones it capable of charging laptops and stuff because it has power delivery which is pretty cool We have Nintendo switch which to be honest. I don't use that much for your often the last thing this room I guess I think this is the last piece. It's the Google home Mini So this is something that I've grown to like more and more over time it's just a really simple 50 dollar device that gives you home automation and just Assistant features and stuff like that. It's pretty cool. That basically wraps it up I should know what to chairs, so there's two chairs in here these are There okay, I got to be honest. They look really cool, but they're not for everyone because they are very stiff They're not like super comfortable chairs these are from a company called pentatonix, and it's called the air tool But what makes these chair special is that the entire chair is made from recycled materials? So I kind of feel a little bit better about myself using them and that basically wraps it up. This is the office tour of My house ok. Thanks for watching. Hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs. You liked it subs of you loves it See you guys next time",

    "transcript": "[Liquid pouring] [Music playing] -[Jerry] What do you think? Should we drive straight over that mountain? -[Zack] Nah, I think on this first trip we should keep all four tires on the ground. [Music playing] -[Jerry] Wow, pretty nice view. -[Zack] Yeah, it's alright. -[Jerry] Want to grab a drink? -[Zack] Yeah. -[Jerry] Think they figured it out yet? -[Zack] I mean, probably. -[Jerry] This whole time everyone thinks there's one of us. -[Zack] When in reality there are two of us. -[Together] Teamwork. -[Jerry] Zack, did you forget the ice? -[Zack] I thought you were supposed to get the ice. -[Jerry] I'm in charge of the cooler. -[Zack] That's actually perfect though because this cooler is the world's first portable, battery powered, refrigerator freezer that instantly makes its own ice in 12 minutes. -[Jerry] Prove it. -[Zack] Let's get started. [Intro] -[Zack] When EcoFlow first reached out and said they had a battery powered cooler for me to check out, at first I was like...but then they said it instantly makes its own ice in 12 minutes, and then I was like...that's something I gotta see. Inside the cooler today for lunch all we have are drinks and a few apples. There is room for about 30 cans inside of here. Kind of convenient because this divider turns into a cutting board and allows this all to be one space instead of two. Since it has the ability to split in half, we can have a fridge and a freezer and the halves are interchangable. Or you can just have one big giant open compartment that is either of them. And the cooling is accomplished by an almost 300 watt hour battery pack in the back, which I'll show you in a sec. First, the ice maker. Inside the ice maker are 18 cylindrical rods. All made with food grade material of course. The metal rods get so cold that ice begins to form instantly when it touches the surface. Water normally starts freezing at 32 degrees Fahrenheit, or zero degrees if you live somewhere with a functional form of measurement. In order to get water to freeze instantly though we have to drop those temperatures down even farther...30 degrees below freezing. The water turns from a liquid to a solid, layer on layer, until we have enough ice to make a cube. Or ice cylinders in our case 18 of them. -[Jerry] I mean that's cool and all, but what if we were to make ice cubes out of Mountain Dew? -[Zack] That's a pretty dumb question. No one is ever going to... [Liquid pouring] We have a normal ice cylinder and then a Mountain Dew ice cylinder. It's got like a pink hue to it with bubbles on the inside. If you can see it, like the bubbles froze in place. Super cool. Did not freeze any of the flavor with it though. I'm going to have to say that one's a fail. Not terrible...but not good. Mountain Dew can be made into ice cubes, it just doesn't taste like Mountain Dew anymore. To get the excess Mountain Dew out of the machine we have a drain right here. When it comes to the walk around, we have a handle on this side. You've already seen the interior compartments as well as the ice maker with its removable ice tray. Over here on this side we have the wheels as well as the plug. The EcoFlow Glacier can be plugged into a wall, plugged into a 12 volt car outlet, or plugged into 240 volts worth of solar panels. And those solar panels can charge up the whole unit in just about 2 hours, making this portable refrigerator truly off-grid. -[Jerry] I guess it would be pretty convenient for our RVers, campers, or the entirety of civilization when the solar flares knock out the power grid. -[Zack] Don't listen to him. Let me show you the battery. The battery is in this compartment right here, and can be used as a portable power bank with the USB-C out. And this singular battery can keep the fridge cold for up to 40 hours. EcoFlow is super good at making batteries. Their systems have been powering my barn for the last 2 years. And, of course, there's a retractable handle that can fold out and be used to carry this around, because any cooler fully loaded is going to be fairly heavy. And they did tell me very specifically that the EcoFlow Glacier is built for off-road scenarios. So the refrigerant, or whatever technology is making things cold in there, can handle a few bumps like we gave it today. All the features like changing the temperature or starting or stopping the icemaker can also be accomplished through the app. Overall I'm pretty impressed. It is a very specific piece of hardware for a very specific group of people, but for that group it's incredibly useful. I'll probably end up using it in more places than just my Hummer. So I won't bolt it down anywhere just to keep it portable. I'm excited to see where future technology takes us. You can grab your own EcoFlow Glacier with the link in the description. Thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around. -[Jerry] He drove off without me.",

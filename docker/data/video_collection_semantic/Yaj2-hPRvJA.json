    "transcript": "would you look at that I finally got my grubby Little Mix on a 40 series GPU this is an RTX 4070 TI and in today's video I'm gonna test it in five games that have been on steam's most played list for as long as I could remember to see how this performs in games that you're playing and then I'm gonna put it against a significantly cheaper but also very powerful graphics card to establish just how much more gaming you're getting compared to a good value from the previous generation for its frankly obscene asking price thank you the 4070 TI in question is some p and Y variant that I've not been able to find for sale anywhere but I got it through one of corsair's build kits that Anna put together in the last video the card comes with an overcompensatingly massive triple slot cooler on it with the now very trendy through backplate airflow design the cooler shroud is a bit plasticky for my liking but at least you get a metal-ish backplate and at the end of the stubby PCB we have a 16-pin power connector all in all it's a pretty basic version of the 470 TI but it's got it where it counts having said that let's do a quick teardown before we throw this card at some of the most addictive games on Steam so this is going to be my first Peak under the hood of a 40 series GPU and I'm not gonna lie I'm pretty excited let's check it out foreign yes that just pops off so there's actually no contact between the back of the PCB and the back plate but I don't know how much contact would do considering that we have this like plastic coating on the bottom of the back plate now on the back of the PCB you can see that we've got some some ectoplasm all over the place that's not the kind of thing that I'm used to seeing on a new card this kind of spunky residue all over the back p and Y was clearly real excited all over the back of these other than the excretion all over it this is such a tiny little PCB look at that it's like it's so small and then that says no tearing up on it for some reason I don't know what they mean by that oh the rear i o Shields keeping things in place and then this should just pop off yes now I think we can finally get around to popping this off yes that was really easy to do now oh I despise those fan connectors I really do but it's okay they've only been mildly mutilated there is a lot of fin stack going on and we'll see what the temperatures are like later on there are six heat pipes running through the length of the cooler they're not the fattest heat pipes ever but there's a reasonable amount of them the PCB is Tiny and adorable there are some power phases all over the place there's also 12 gigs of gddr6x on here with our RTX 4070 TI die in the middle oh let me clean it off and have a closer look yeah it just looks like any recent Nvidia die not entirely sure why I'm disappointed by that but I was expecting something a bit more exciting under here like a xenomorph scrotum or summon and after that very reasonable disappointment it's time to see how this Beast runs some steam Esports titles so lost ark is taking its sweet time to launch for the first time that's not the graphics card's fault I assume that it's just been busy installing Amazon malware on my system in the process now I'm not going to be testing any of the games at 1080p today because frankly if you're buying a 4070 TI for 1080p gameplay your money should take a restraining order out on you so I'm going to start all of the testing at 1440p and for lost Arc I'm gonna have the rest of the settings cranked and just a couple of moments into my first lost Arc experience my brain was struggling to process it our armor Gunner but after choosing a very agile lady character I was ready for some testing okay well straight off the bat were pegged at 120 frames per second and we're just using 45 of the GPU at 37 Watts this 800 graphics card really is putting in some work here it doesn't even seem to notice that a game is happening at this point oh I need to be mashing more buttons I see that was the mistake I was making so that's how you play the game so I swiftly swapped the 4K to wake the GPU up a bit hey there we go the graphics card is actually having to do things now we're sitting at about 80 utilization but still pegged at 120 frames per second but despite the higher GPU utilization we just lost 0.3 of our average FPS so basically a rounding error worth of performance loss going from 1440p to 4K so I had to figure out how to unshackle the frame rate to get any kind of useful numbers okay so now I've actually managed to unblock the frame rate so we're not just stuck at 120 frames per second now we're now getting over 300 frames per second which I think is kind of a minimum requirement are you really even gaming if you get less than that sarcasm aside this time we got a more reasonable performance impact Boeing to 4K but we were still getting over 120 frames per second this is some very fluid lady running in circles action we've got going here wait a minute I may not have played pubg in a while but I have hundreds of hours in this game why is it forcing me to do AI training matches and while I slept my way through the mandatory basic training let me quickly tell you about the settings again I started off with 1440p but this time with everything set to high settings so at 1440p high settings we we are getting lots of frame rates although when we do have lots of distance in view it actually drops to about 160 frames per second I think that maybe more of a game problem than a graphics card problem considering that we have about 40 utilization and we're barely drawing 100 Watts on the GPU now moving over to 4K uh when we're looking at the big scene it's running about the same although this time we are getting roughly a hundred percent utilization so the GPU is having to work harder but that is a 140-ish frames per second while looking over the expanse of the map but when it comes to a more varied Benchmark run the 4070 TI does curb storm pubg at both 1440p and 4K even at these much higher than competitive settings the first thing to bear in mind with Apex is that it has a frame rate limit out of the box of 144 frames per second but at 1440p very high settings that basically doesn't use the RTX 470 ti so I've uncapped it and again we're well over 200 frames per second at 1440p so basically this card is a monster the 13700k in here is also putting in work it is feeding the 4070 TI frames very effectively yeah it's changed over to 4K and see what happens changing to the native resolution of this display we're still getting almost 200 frames per second so we're well over the refresh rate of this monitor we're actually getting a surprisingly similar ballpark of frame rate for all of these games and even with the higher than normal settings I've been testing with for any of the three games I've tested so far unless you're running a 2 140hz 1440p display or 120hz 4K display the 470 TI is mostly an epine purchase at this point but maybe the next game will change that oh nope never mind Dota 2 is not the game in this lineup to change that speaking for personal experience is somebody that's played quite a lot of Dota 2 you'd be hard-pressed to find a system that wouldn't run this game well you could probably dig out the command computer of an Apollo 11 Rocket from 1969 and it would still be able to run the crap out of this game even at 4K came on Steam by far CS go is the most convincing argument I've seen for this 800 graphics card in the Roundup so far at 1440p you can see here we're getting well over 500 frames per second and in terms of GPU utilization we're sitting at about 50 percent that is higher than some of the other games yeah I I guess that means that csgo is worth buying an 800 graphics card for uh that's a joke by the way it isn't although maybe things change when we switch it over to 4K wow that has barely dropped um although we are getting slightly higher GPU utilization so that's worth it I guess anyway with that I think this is a good point to throw in our cheaper previous gen competitor to see how much performance we lose no I get it this is a slightly unfair comparison but hear me out for a second because at the moment you can consistently get 6700 xt's for under 400 and the last time I checked aside from some of them occasionally breaking this is a fire breathing monster of a graphics card and I was just curious in games that most people play how much more performance are you getting paying more than double for something even more beastler how much graphics card do you really need oh yes we are getting very very many frame rates here on this 120 hertz monitor you really miss the 280 frames per second of the 4070 TI actually Jokes Aside let's set it over to 4K and see if the 6700 XT is still saturating the monitor now there's a whole bunch of explosions and death going on here but this is actually the first time since we've started testing for this video where we haven't gotten a surplus of frame rate for our monitor like what is this unplayable garbage we're just getting 90 frames per second at 4K very high settings what an outrage oh okay well with pubg at 1440p high settings indoors we have lost over a hundred frames per second compared to the 470 TI but looking into the distance we're getting about the same frame rate although this time it's not because of engine limitations it's because the graphics cards maxed out which I don't know it feels like a bit of a technicality to me switching over to 4K again we're descending into the depths of unplayability with a mere 80-ish frames per second at high settings that nobody uses I don't know what that does but it's scaring the crap out of me and it is kind of tanking the frame rate a little bit at 1440p very high settings with Apex we're getting quite a lot of frame rate with the 6700 XT and it it feels very stable like look at that frame time graph it's looking good although of course the 4070 TI gave us a lot more performance we were averaging over 250 frames per second at 1440p with that card now at 4K while terrible things are happening to my team we're getting almost half the frame rate of the 4070 TI but with more reasonable settings for a competitive shooter the 6700 XD should still be able to saturate our 4K High refresh rate monitor now with both DOTA and CS go it's basically not worth testing with DOTA there was very small fluctuations in frame rate and even if 4K very high settings as a keen player subjectively at 4K I just couldn't tell a difference between the two graphics cards with cs go there was a bigger difference in frame rate between the two graphics card mods but at 4K we were still getting almost 400 frames per second with the 6700 XT so my main takeaway from this video is why would you buy an 800 plus graphics card if a 350 one performs like this especially considering the monitors we all have but then again that's only based on a small sample size of very popular games and isn't taking into account things like future proofing anyway with that until the next video subscribe for some more arbitrary comparisons",

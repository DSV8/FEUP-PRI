    "transcript": "- You guys, WWDC is gonna be here before we know it. I'm so excited. It's next week. It is gonna be here so so soon and with that comes more rumors. And one of the big things, obviously, that they talk about at WWDC because, it is a developer's conference, is software. So IOS 13 is gonna be the next release of IOS and the thing that I'm most excited about is dark mode. All of the apps that we have, especially Mojave, now with their dark mode update, it's been a long time coming, that iOS needs to have this option. What I have actually set up, I will do a triple click and just like inverts all the colors. It's like fake dark mode. So we'll triple click, and it takes us back to normal. But an actual dark mode, is something that is it's gotta be, it has to be. There are some screen shot links we have over here. So here it is. Dark mode iOS 13 will include dark mode for the first time. I remember when they originally announced Mojave with dark mode, that was a huge deal and I don't think I've ever turned it off. I've had dark mode on since I installed it. Let's take a look and see what else Mac Rumors is rounding up here. They always such great round-ups. So the first thing, obviously, was dark mode. Here are some linked screen shots. Home screen will look similar to the Home screen in light mode, though the dock will be darker. An updated volume control? That is so something that they should have done a long time ago! It always drives me crazy because the volume is over top of whatever it is that you're watching, so that takes up so much screen real estate. Oh, iPad tweaks! This is something that I'm excited about. They're gonna be improving the multitasking. And actually this is down here. Here it is. Mouse support on iPad Pro. You would think that's something that they already had by now, I mean, the iPad pro is really powerful, so this will just make it even more powerful. So that's exciting! New gestures. iPads are expected to gain new undo gestures for text input. Cross-Platform iOS and Mac apps. Oooo! This is interesting too. Messages will be more like WhatsApp so you have like a profile and a picture. A new Find My iPhone app! Oooo! How many times have you guys used the Find My iPhone app? Just I would like to see a show of hands. You can put your hand raises in the comments below. I have used it so many times. I use my Apple Watch so many times throughout the day, (dinging) to find my iPhone. It says it's working on an all new app that combines Find My Friends and Find My Phone into one. The app is expected to be called \"Find My\" which will include a new \"find network\" feature. Be tracked down even when not connected to Wi-Fi or cellular network, oh wow, by leveraging other nearby devices. That is actually really, really incredible. What that means, is if your phone is in airplane mode, or not even connected to Wi-Fi or cellular, you'll be able to find it. My sister had her laptop stolen. It was in the airport and she was getting a massage at one of those like airport massage kiosks and somebody just came down, swiped it. We tried to get security footage, but nothing ever really came of it, unfortunately. But what this means, is if you do lose something like that and it is lost and it's not connected to Wi-Fi, using other devices around it, you'll be able to find that missing item. It would be interesting if somehow Apple ends up buying Tile, if you guys are familiar with Tile. I did a video on this so long ago, but I have Tiles in all of my things, all of my back packs, all of my luggages, suitcases, everything. The only downside to Tile is it's not GPS but it does rely on it's network of other Tile users so using blue tooth, they're all constantly connecting to each other. So if you do mark an item as lost, that item then goes into lost mode and then it's continually pinging, looking for other Tiles around it to help you locate that lost item. So I feel like that's something that Apple is -- It's so easy to do. That would mean that if blue tooth or something isn't on on your phone but it is lost, when you put it into lost mode, blue tooth is automatically turned on, and then it's constantly using other devices to find your lost phone. I like this! Oh. Well, I kept reading the article. It said Apple is also said to be working on a related hardware product described as a Tile-like item tracker. Oh! I like this! You can attach it to any item and paired to any user's iCloud -- There's no word when Apple might debut this accessory but it could come in the fall alongside new iPhones. Updated maps. Updated reminders. Books, Home, Health. The Health app will feature an improved view of daily activities and more comprehensive tracking of menstrual cycles. Hmm. I wonder if they have like an option, you could share your cycle with your friends. I mean, I don't know. I think that would be useful in some cases. I don't wanna think about it. Speed enhancements. Keyboard, Fonts, Updated Share Sheet. What is a Share Sheet? It's -- sharing photos and web links. Screen Time: new feature limiting who kids can and can't contact at specific times. I like that. Revamped File app. We definitely need a revamped File app. New emojis! Flamingo, otter, waffle, sloth, white heart, people holding hands, ice cube, snorkel, orangutan, juice box, falafel, and more. What the heck is that? Well thank you guys for watching. I just want to talk a little bit about some of the iOS 13 updates that I saw because I'm getting so excited for WWDC. It's gonna be here so soon. I will be there. Be sure to follow me on Twitter and Instagram because that's where I'll be posting most of my first updates and then of course some YouTube videos so be sure to subscribe and hit the bell so you'll be alerted when I do post new videos. And I think that's it. Let me know what's the one thing on iOS that you guys are looking for. Also, what are you looking forward to at WWDC? What do you think they're gonna announce? I'll be probably making a follow up video talking about some WWDC predictions, but for now, I'm gonna go and I will see you guys in the next video. Bye! (upbeat music)",

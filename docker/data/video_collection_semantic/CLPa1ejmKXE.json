    "transcript": "good people for $100 this is the best gaming headset experience you can get and treat yourself with and if you've come here with a similar budget in mind well look no further we have received so many requests to check out the Philips SHP9500 and see what all the fuss is about and thank you to everyone who has pointed us towards this wonderful inexpensive gem based on countless user reviews it's like the best 69 dollars you can spend on a pair of open-back headphones but combine that with the boom pro microphone from V-moda you have yourself incredible sound for your ears and for your voice to the new cooler master master mouth 710 a weird name but damn this thing is good with an ultra lightweight body at only 53 grams for excellent flick control and aim correction the ultra weave cable is awesome for Wireless like feel the ambidextrous shape for me personally is super comfortable and then like the shorter body plus the glide is smooth thanks to white PTFE feet enjoy the domination with an excellent optical sensor and despite the funky name the cooler master mm 710 is legit check it out the low all right let's run down the basics for the headphones first the SHP9500 is a lightweight at 320 grams it is size adjustable to fit all head sizes with numbers on the headband to remember your profile the build quality is mainly plastic with metal mesh covering the driver with a good amount of resistance on those swivel joints they're not playing around and conform to the shape of your head the pattern here is enough for my preference I don't make contact with the driver wall and the clamping force is pretty light there's no way you'd have any pressure or fatigue after hours of use but some might feel this thing is a bit too light clamping force wise the cable is removable it's too long in my opinion tow at 3 meters but at least it's rubber so the cable noise is not that significant and it's because of the removable cable we're able to convert this into a headset so meet the $35 boompro by V-moda one of the best microphones I've tested in its class which is why it's so easy to recommend so as long as your headphone has a 3.5 millimeter jack you'll be able to use the blue bro with it it carries both the headphone and microphone signals there's an inline remote for volume and mic mute plus the low profile nature of the mic is just a bonus I initially wanted to run this pair with the mod mic Wireless and that is a great microphone but that would just skyrocket our total value for this contraption that we're creating and then boom Pro is just a better value overall plus it replaces the default cable therefore we're not adding any bulk and that's for the microphone test this is what the boomPro sounds like we have done a full comprehensive analysis and comparison with this mic and many other gaming headsets make sure to check it out and that will give you an idea of how this thing compares and just how good of a value it is for $30 now the clarity is there it sounds natural and doesn't sound nasally it has beautiful bass and fullness to the vocals unfortunately or fortunately it does not have any noise compression and noise cancellation of the background so you can say it's kind of negative if you're typing on the keyboard it will pick that up if you're using a mouse it will pick that up if you can hear Michael typing from a different dimension it will pick it up as well and the reason why this thing sounds so good is because we don't have any noise compression characteristics and no noise cancellation built into the microphone capsule and for me that is a positive but let me know what you think now in terms of sound quality I can describe it in three terms open sound clear detail and smooth playback the open nature of the drivers plus light clamping force delivers a type of mellow and non aggressive listening experience the clarity is impressive especially with any vocal playback but at the same time pushing through with that smooth high end it really interesting combination that keeps the detail without any harsh elements the low end is present so the signature is a bit fuller but just don't expect anything too deep with regards to the bass my only complaint with the sound signature would be the mid-range as it's not so forward making some elements sound a bit too distant and this is already an open-back headset therefore the mid-range is like little bit too far now in the gaming environment like red that too it gives me nice environmental expansion so the sound is open with good definition of raindrops mosquitoes in the forest and the of the wind the footsteps and the speech all come through very well the mid-range could be slightly more forward to give you even more definition in the entire spectrum but this thing is fantastic for competitive genres so like in modern warfare 2 it's a great example where audio cues are crucial as those footsteps are just so loud and help with directionality the open style and good clarity is that perfect combination for shooters like COD and having that quality mic in there is just a massive bonus for online play I do have a few complaints about this pair and even though it's $69 let's still mention them the clamping force for users who prefer a tighter seal even with an open back design like the HD58X or 650 or whatever from Sennheiser you might be disappointed because these are quiet light on the clamping force the cable well note this one but the original cable is 3 meters which is way too long for mobile use the left and right distinction on the ear cups is just a bit obnoxious sure it's part of the design element but we already have the left and right distinction inside the headband so why are they repeated and number 4 the little confusion that is caused by the 9500 versus the newer 9500s which is significantly more expensive at $99 and that also comes with a 1.5 millimeter cable instead of 3 meter cable so that's a positive and a slightly different frequency tuned on the drivers and that is the main difference but it's like they're practically an identical pair let's get some more opinion Sieber what are your first impressions first impressions I am actually really impressed with the Philips 9500 I mean for 70 bucks this thing when I when I just had this I I do not expect you to be $70 because you I didn't know the price was so as soon as I tried them on for the first time I'm like wow this it's great really oh thank you I appreciate that it picks up your hair every time when I when I when we when we switch headsets good I mean I can still see your hair on it because the material is yeah it's definitely difficult to keep clean so that's something to keep note of but other than that I can't really complain anything about this headset especially since it cost $70 that's that's my take on it peace out mics in the hot seat working first impressions when it comes to comfort comfort I find that they're nice and light the only problem that I have is that the clamping force for my head just isn't enough they feel like they're moving around a little bit too much and even if I go to the smallest setting they do feel a little bit like they're actually writing on the top of my ears so the mic I absolutely love the quality my issue is that it's a little bit too malleable so if you bump it it's gonna get all bent out of sorts and you're gonna have to reposition it the cable itself the braiding is well done enough that you don't have to worry about inking or anything else but I do like the rubberized cable on the original headset a lot better well from a price per force perspective I can't think of anything else that comes anywhere close to it especially in the gaming headset market that's considerably overpriced these days and having said all that this is a great combination for around $100 that gives you fantastic vocal clarity and a really nice sounding headphone to that will make a killer gaming combo I'll leave links for all types of headsets including this and the microphone and other options that you might consider in the description below thanks much for watching let me know if you've experienced this pair and what are your thoughts is it worth the hype and the $69 price point I mean that's a that's a really good price point thanks for watching make sure to check out this other relevant content I'll talk to you next",

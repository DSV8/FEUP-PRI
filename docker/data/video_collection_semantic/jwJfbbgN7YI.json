The cycle usually goes something like this: product launches; product arrives; video goes up; video gets forgotten; on to the next product. It's a fun hamster wheel, but it's still a hamster wheel.  So I thought Id take a second before the spring smartphone season to share with you some of the tech Ive reviewed that's been good enough (or just weird enough) to find a home in my everyday life. No sponsors, no BS. Im MrMobile and these are the surprise hits from two years of reviewing: the Tech That Stuck.

    "transcript": "- [Michael] Tech YouTube is great, but it's so easy to forget the good stuff. I mean, think about it, product launches, product arrives, video goes up, video gets forgotten, and onto the next product. So, I thought I'd take a second before the spring smartphone season to share with you some of the gadgets I've reviewed that have been good enough to find a home in my everyday life. No sponsors, no BS. I'm MrMobile, and this is The Tech That Stuck. (upbeat music) Okay, let's begin with the predictable and work our way to the weirdos. Number six, the Microsoft Precision Surface Mouse. This came to me alongside the Surface Book 2 review device, and it inspired me to ask for a whole bunch of mice from other manufacturers so I could make a mobile mouse shootout video. Well, a month later, most of those mice are still in the box, and the Precision Surface Mouse is still my go-to. I promise, that video is still coming, but the Microsoft is probably gonna keep its place on my mousepad. Soft-touch paint job, all the right curves, a big, heavy scroll wheel, about the only thing I don't like about it besides its size is the price, this will become a theme. Number five, Moment Lenses for the Pixel 2 XL. These guys have been back in headlines recently with their new anamorphic lens kit, but I'm still rolling with the glass I covered last year, and I break out these lenses all the time. The phone case is super ugly, and yeah, the lenses are big and heavy, but they're nowhere near as heavy as my studio camera. Anytime I can leave that behind, we're having a good day. The wide-angle lens, for a moment, has helped me out on the Tesla Model 3 test drive, all that cramped airplane shooting needed for the Planet Gemini review, and more Instagram photos than I can count, while the macro lens gave me that extreme closeup of the Snapdragon 845, which in actuality, is smaller than a pinky nail. Full disclosure, Moment does have a commission program for influencers, but I never set it up properly, so I'm not getting any bucks for saying that. Stupid maybe, but it's the truth. Number four, the Motiv Smart Ring. Even though it's yet another thing to charge, and even though it, until recently, required an iPhone to sync with, this little fingertip Fitbit has found itself on my finger more often than not. I'm sure Motiv doesn't like me calling it a Fitbit of any kind, but what better way to describe a device that fits on your finger, tracks your steps and heart rate and looks pretty great in the process? Sadly, my usage has tapered off in recent weeks because I managed to lose the special Motiv charger. I'd call it another argument in favor of charging standards, but for one thing, what were they gonna do? This is a tiny ring, you can't put a USB port on it. And for another, maybe I should just start losing stuff less. Number three, the Fonesalesman FurniQi. If you've got a phone that supports wireless charging and you can get over that brand name, you will not find a more minimal Qi charger than this, because it's literally a table with a pad build into the top. It's only five watts, so it's a little pokey, and it can be tough to find the sweet spot by feel. But it's such a beautiful piece, that I have been forgiving it those failings since I first installed it as my bedside table back in 2015. If you're still with me folks and you're wondering where all the phones and laptops and holsters are, well you might be interested in the Everyday Carry video I made last fall, which is still mostly accurate, and covers most of that conventional stuff. And if you missed that, make sure you don't miss the next one. Subscribe to the MrMobile on YouTube. Back to the grind with number two, something that hasn't actually been featured prominently in any MrMobile video, despite it hanging just outside the frame in almost every shot. This is the UE Roll 2, my favorite Bluetooth speaker of all time. I don't remember how it came to the studio or who sent it, I just know it's been here keeping Mr. Justice and me entertained for, well, as long as we've been here. It's got incredible sound for its size, great Bluetooth range, solid battery life, a large assortment of colors, and you can link it with other UE rolls for stereo, and it's IPX7 waterproof. Just a wonderful product, through and through. Closing it out at number one is most definitely one of the strangest things I've reviewed, and one I only reviewed under duress. See, CrackBerry Kevin suggested I cover the Bose SoundWear last winter, and when I balked at the concept of a wearable speaker, he gave me so much guff that I was essentially shamed into buying a set to review. Okay, well that was in December of 2017, and I S you not, I have used the SoundWear at least every other day since then. Yes, it still looks like a weird toilet seat, and it can't replace headphones in public, because you'll bug everyone around you, but it's also expensive. Because Bose. I said all this in the full review, but I also said that for a guy like me who's always on the move even when I'm at home, the Soundware is very convenient for flitting between rooms and going to the basement and back, doing the laundry, going anywhere and never leaving my music behind, and never missing a doorbell or a shout from across the room, 'cause I'm not closed down and confined in some headphones. Plus, the sound is amazing because, Bose. Make fun of me all you want, I know it looks like a weird neck pillow, but I love the Soundware. And if your life sounds at all like mine, I'm pretty sure you will too. (uplifting music) All the items I just listed folks, are down in the description if you want to pick one up for yourself. And, there is one item that didn't quite make it to the list, not because it wasn't good enough, but because it was so good, it deserves its own standalone video. To make sure you don't miss it, when that review comes out, which will be soon, subscribe to the MrMobile on YouTube. Until next time, thanks for watching and stay mobile, my friends. (upbeat motivating music)",

    "transcript": "it's finally that time of the year again for our annual AliExpress gaming pre-built purchase this time around I spent about a thousand one hundred Canadian dollars on this system that's including tax and shipping by the way and I'm really excited to see what kind of weird and wonderful creation we get for that amount but first today's video is sponsored by the node which is slowly being absorbed by Akamai to form the most powerful Linux based cloud computing service the world has ever seen kinda like it already is just look at this long list of Linux based Cloud Computing Services they offer hmm I can tell you're impressed and this combined with their competitive pricing and award-winning customer support makes Le node a no-brainer Choice sign up using the link in the video description to get a 60 day hundred dollar free credit thank you now the first thing that I've noticed about this system aside from the couple of bruises on the box is that we don't get the prestigious work of box tape man but I think the reason for this is that I didn't buy the system from the AliExpress gaming pre-built kingpins IPS i instead bought it from a seller called MXZ and they probably still need to earn box tape man's Trust okay oh well what we lose in box tape man effort MXZ makes up for in Spades with a box slathered in the gameriest shape and the box has a red undercarriage MXZ you spoil us on top of the box we get a power cable and some Wi-Fi antenna in an unnecessarily fancy bag although interestingly they did send the wrong power plug and we also get a quick start guide important wow that is a very nicely printed and clear quick start guide good job the foam situation is a little bare there's not a whole bunch of it but at least the bit that is there is nice soft foam I do want to put this thin piece of foam back for when I remove the PC foreign interesting looking system first off it is in a gigabyte case that I've never seen before which has three RGB fans in the front that are a greater risk of choking than a three-year-old in a Lego factory because the closest thing we have to front ventilation is this obscenely dense slat paneling but at least we have that RGB ping going and at least again we have some top ventilation with actual fans populating it these are set up for exhaust though I do want to test what turning these around will do later on for the temperatures but we'll worry about that when we get to the testing phase it's back and then up here we have some very usable front I O with a dedicated RGB button which should make you the Envy of all your 12 year old friends and around the pack we have a perfectly serviceable looking i o some exciting looking graphics card action with a Wi-Fi card and some power supply which we'll have a closer look at later but with that let's open her up this is stupid mouth oh very good we've got an expanded foam insert which is a great way of protecting a PC while shipping although they are a bit of a pain to get out oh and they've added even more foam for good measure although I feel like this is a placebo bit of foam at best and under all of that is our reasonably snazzy looking system the first thing that I notice is that shiny dual Channel Ram kit very good this is a 16 gig kit of Kirkland brand Ram it seems like running at 3200 megahertz and next that we have the good old stock AMD cooler I can't remember what CPUs under there presumably an AMD one but we'll figure that out later we've also got a 500 gig gigabyte nvme drive and a very basic looking gigabyte b450 motherboard which should get the job done but it's really nothing fancy and then in terms of the graphics card we've got an MSI Ventus RTX 2060 super which may be a bit of an older graphics card but it's still very capable I think we'll find out a bit later on closer inspection of the graphics card there seems to be a cable that is very very close to doing some terrible things to that graphics card fan we'll see what happens when we start it up and in terms of power supply we get this DK 5.0 premium power supply that I've never seen before so let's open up the back and investigate oh that's a loose panel nice nothing like a good old Molex centipede always great to see other than that cable Management's pretty solid back here although I do want to get that power supply out and have a closer look at it somehow again we managed to get a power supply that I've never seen before after like four years of doing this I don't know how that keeps happening but apparently it's a 500 watt 80 plus bronze rated premium power supply what more could you want with that I'm gonna stuff its guts back in and then we can fire it up to see what kind of venereal disease we're working with exciting stuff we get to see if it actually powers on whoa that's a unique color palette and it's very much alive with Windows 10 on it nonetheless in terms of VD there's basically nothing which is kind of standard for these AliExpress systems the CPU in here is a ryzen 540 500 a chip that I've never had a look at before so I'm curious to see how it keeps up with that 2060 super oh no they forgot to enable the xmps that's real naughty MXZ which I think means we should see what kind of gaming performance we get out of this system but first this is another day another time I drive out of Franklin's house here at 1080p High settings the system is um not not doing a whole lot we're hovering about 40 utilization for both the graphics card and the CPU although what that does mean is we are seeing very good temperatures I mean we haven't even hit 50 degrees Celsius on the GPU yet the system is also nice and quiet despite the fact that we have 8 million Molex fans going they're not the noisiest Molex fans you know that's very good let's try a different game uh the the CPU is struggling a little bit to keep up with the RTX 2060 super in here but we are getting when it's not stuttering but that's standard Battlefield 5. we are getting about 120 frames per second and now that we have actual utilization happening the temperatures have climbed quite a bit especially on the CPU we're getting close to 70 degrees Celsius which isn't bad it really isn't with that let me play for a bit more and see what the temperature is top out so I've been playing Battlefield 5 for a bit now and the temperatures are exactly the same so what I want to do next is enable the xmps to see how much of a difference that makes and then we'll try some real soul-crushing new games foreign I think it's running a little bit better when we look at the standardized benchmarks you can see that the main difference is actually the one percent lows so you know you don't have as big dips in terms of the frame rate basically turn xmps on is the point we all have ingrained into our eyelids at this point the same goes for Battlefield 5. it's not a life-changing Difference by any means but at least we're getting some higher one percent lows which always makes the game feel a bit better and besides it just took one press of a button basically oh I forgot that I wanted to swap those top fans around to an intake to see if that helps the temperatures let me do that before I try and ruin this species innocence with Last of Us and other game you can just tell these are some Primo quality fans oh okay well we may have shaved off about three degrees Celsius of our CPU but it's just moved on to our GPU I don't know if that's worth it it's getting hotter as well it it keeps climbing now it's also definitely noisier so I I have clearly made a bit of a whoopsie oh wow this system runs the crap out of cyberpunk this is 1080p medium settings so it's not super cranked in terms of settings but it's over 80. sometimes it's good let's actually see if we can pull off high we're getting a very similar frame rate in fact oh here's the fancy car again found it yeah the system is a little beast although uh cyberpunk isn't necessarily the creme de La Creme of system crotch punchers anymore so let's try some even newer games at 1080p high it's not going super well but for a game like the last of us this is pretty playable and these are high settings so you can drop them down a bit if you if you feel the need to oh very very reflective hole down there it does feel a bit heavy if that makes sense but this is very much a game that's running and then finally we have it's too dark I can't see anything the video game running at 1080p 4 gig High I think we are getting over 60 frames per second it's running nicely it's actually running better than the last of us was running although we do also have some stuttering going on but yeah the graphics the bit that you can see of it does look very nice and yeah the system's running it well which brings me to the end of my slightly more than annual look at an AliExpress gaming pre-build considering the price I think it held up well although I do want some context so I'm gonna go and buy a similarly priced system from Best Buy so we can do a bit of a pre-built shootout sub to the channel if you don't want to miss that and until then thank you for watching bye thank you",

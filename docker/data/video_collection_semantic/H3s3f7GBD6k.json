    "transcript": "self-isolation sucks guys it really does the streets are empty it's affecting everyone but it's the responsible thing to do at this time and I hope you guys are doing the same thing right now but getting back to the video you see over these past few years I've upgraded my PC my smartphone a lot of the household items tech items but one of the things that definitely needs an upgrade is my current Wi-Fi setup i've been using the asus RT66U it's a really old router in fact it was handed down by Mike when I moved here to Montreal it's not an AC router so it's really really old and it's been getting the job done but I've been experiencing some dropouts especially when I'm upstairs so the Wi-Fi signal strength isn't the greatest and now that I'm spending a lot of time at home working on multiple projects doing a lot of uploads on YouTube and of course downloading steam because gaming is definitely a priority it's it just needs an upgrade so our friends over at ASUS hooked us up with their latest Zenwifi 6 routers and I'm just gonna try and eliminate the bottleneck that I'm currently experiencing and see what this whole deal about wifi 6 is so just to give you an idea my router is sitting behind this closet as you can see it's right over there my modem is behind that box or sitting inside that box and I've channeled the ethernet cables and all that stuff to the router and yeah this is this is what I have right now this is my existing setup so what I'm gonna be doing right now is running a few tests on my notebook to see what kind of performance how fast how reliable my existing Wi-Fi router is all right so I'm on my five gigahertz Network right now I'm just gonna quickly run my speed tests okay we're getting about 150 down and then our uploads are about 54 ok so my next test is basically downloading four episodes from ozark that's on Netflix highly recommend is a great show so let's just do that I'm gonna hit the stopwatch it took three minutes and 20 seconds to download four episodes okay so our next test is to hop into a Skype call with Mike and I'm gonna go through video because we're trying to use as much as bandwidth as we can technically I shouldn't have any issues because I've been pretty successful with video calls in my living room but I have experienced drops when I'm outside or when I'm upstairs so it's yeah what a quality like it looks pretty good for a notebook and I can hear you love clear so yeah that's good alright guys so I am outside about a hundred feet away from the Wi-Fi router and I'm gonna run a speed test on this laptop the signal strength is really really bad ok so we got about 52 megabits per second download and about 23 uploads so yes it's significantly slower for sure I expected that but let's move on to our next test next up we're downloading Ozark for episodes I am gonna start my stopwatch and the speeds are roughly yeah it's like 40 41 guys we have a problem there is no internet connection I think it dropped the Wi-Fi dropped so I guess that's a fail I haven't moved the laptop whatsoever it's just that the Wi-Fi connection dropped alright so now it's time to give Mike a call hello I know okay so just to let you know the Netflix download failed you can't hear me can you alright so with our baseline tests complete on our existing router it's time to upgrade to the ASUS Zenwifi ax now this is the 2-pack variant which is essentially a mesh system but I'm gonna be running these tests again with just a single modem to see how much stronger Wi-Fi 6 actually is and then maybe in the end of the video I'll walk you through how to set the mesh network which should be pretty straightforward so let's go ahead and quickly unbox this ok what do we have here let's go through what comes in the box having trouble there's a toll-free number that he can reach I've got a quick Scots QuickStart guy here I'm definitely gonna need this when it comes to setting it up and then we have our two systems here so this is our look at how beautiful that is this is one beautiful looking router I've never seen routers as pretty as this one right here good job isus the next thing of course is another module which is right over there I think that's about it very very straightforward packaging you know what this reminds me of this one when to me of unboxing a motherboard but it's a router it's just a router we have the power supply for both of our routers and anything apart and that's pretty much it now one of the main reasons to consider a mesh network is to increase signal strength or network coverage throughout your household say for instance you're living in a 6000 square feet or larger house a single modem is just not going to cut it it just won't be able to cover those spots where you typically find Wi-Fi very very poor in terms of signal strength or not even be able to connect to the internet that's where a second node comes in because you can place this a little further away from your main router and this would create its own Wi-Fi hotspot covering those weaker areas within your household where you typically not get the best Wi-Fi signal now if you're living in a smaller apartment you wouldn't necessarily need to invest in a second node you'll be perfectly fine with a single router especially if it's within 1,500 square feet so with that of the way let's move on to setup guys I really have to get credit to Asus for providing a very simple and straightforward QuickStart guide as you can see there's not a lot of junk you need in fact you just need a single app to get this thing started so the next thing I need to do is replace that router right over there with this beautiful think so let's get this set up the next step is to properly set the router and in order to do that you have to download the Asus router app on your phone whether if it's iOS or Android you can download it through the Play Store or the App Store keep in mind it would be a good idea to download before you switch everything to the new router because then you would lose your Wi-Fi connection so that's a quick tip right there but nonetheless it's pretty straightforward as you can see I'm gonna choose as in Wi-Fi right over there it's gonna ask me to enable location services and all that stuff it's gonna start searching for the router and hopefully it should be able to find it and it looks like it did so I'm just tap that okay so now it's asking me to set up my note which is the second module that did come with the 2-pack but I'm gonna skip that option because like I said earlier I do want to rerun the test with just a single modem to see how strong that is so I'm just gonna skip that and yeah I just get started so I'm just gonna fill out my Wi-Fi settings here I don't want you guys sneaking in so let me do that and I'll get back to you right right in a moment so we're in we're in the Wi-Fi is functional I am connected to the network all right so now comes the moment of truth I'm gonna rerun all of those tests on the Zenbook 15 with this new router and see if there's any improvement keep in mind that that laptop does feature a Wi-Fi 6 network heart so it will be interesting to see how we can leverage Wi-Fi 6 okay so we have speed test loaded up moment of truth my friends let's see if there's an improvement I literally just want to go outside and cry because I that is exactly what I paid for that's beep 450 down 50 up this is crazy alright now let's do the Netflix download cuz this is more this is getting even more exciting one minute and 17 seconds okay that is definitely a noticeable improvement so next up let's let's hop into Skype you sound perfectly fine I think the I guess a million dollar question is when I test all of this outside alright so I'm running in a speed test outside with a new router about a hundred feet away and as you can see that is really fast guys I have connected this laptop to the fastest hobby Hertz channel downloads faster uploads faster let's move on to the Skype call test so can you hear me well I can actually hear you perfectly - we're not skipping there's no audio video lag and you can hear everything that I'm saying there that you're not hearing like five words over a thousand No Wow well there you have it guys Skype conference that's a success it worked just fine okay so the next test is to download the Netflix episode so I'm gonna hit the stopwatch and quickly hit download guys it's downloading all those episodes at close to a hundred and ninety two hundred megabits per second what's really fascinating about this upgrade is the fact that the Wi-Fi signal hasn't dropped it's still downloading so it took three minutes and 36 seconds to download all four episodes that is basically the same time it took for me to download when I was inside my house with the old router Wow alright so let me explain what Wi-Fi 6 is and what it's actually doing to help me out here let's start with what you need to look out for a product that supports Wi-Fi 6 might have a label like one of these and in the specs area there'll be 802 11 AX or in this case of routers it could just use AX and its name the evolution of wireless technology really highlights how our lifestyles have changed and why Wi-Fi 6 might be really important you see these days we have everything from our smart phones to home security systems to thermostats and even some home appliances hooked up to our home network but all of those online devices are fighting for the same connection and I'm sure some of you might be experiencing Wi-Fi issues at home especially during this quarantine period as everyone in the household is trying to connect to the same network at the same time so think of these as multiple data streams trying to access the internet like a bunch of people all trying to fit through a small door or the door is your routers wireless network sure some of you will get through but there's still a bottleneck preventing smooth traffic flow putting this as simply as possible Wi-Fi 6 can add more doors by opening up additional access points and making sure that each one of those doors is bigger to let more data through I hope that made sense so about that bigger door Wi-Fi 6 is rated for up to 10 gigabits per second of bandwidth but there's a catch it's a theoretical speed that can't be hit by a single connection or even under perfect conditions I'll use the issues router that I have here as an example some boxes show AX followed by number like 6600 here on the Zenwifii AX XT8 technically that means 6600 megabits per second but if you look closely at the specs you'll see it's coming from a combination of speeds from Asus is three Wi-Fi 6 channels in this case you can see that the 5 gigahertz second channel will offer the most performance it's super important you run your most bandwidth hungry devices on that band so the focus on Wi-Fi 6 is to really increase the number of devices that can access the network without experiencing any slowdowns they were also rolled improvements to increase performance and maximum range and I was clearly able to experience that with a new router about a hundred feet away from it and you just have to make sure that you have clear access if your neighbors are also using Wi-Fi the last point that I want to touch base on is efficiency supposedly these new wife access controllers are much less power-hungry compared to previous generations so that could help increase battery life on notebooks and smartphones alright so before I wrap things up I do want to quickly walk you through how to set up an AI mesh node so this is the second module that came with the tooth pack so all you have to do is fire up your app and hit up the AI mesh node over there and it's going to start looking for the second module which shouldn't take too long so we're just going to click on that select device location and yeah hit apply and that's it the second node is already paired it was a simple two-step process and it was perfect for a noob like me when it comes to networking the app itself is pretty amazing and there are a bunch of things that this can do like show the status of your mesh network or if you want to add a third node you can certainly go with that option if you really need to and control network settings let's just say the options from the routers main control menu are all here I'm really happy with this Wi-Fi upgrade guys I mean the speeds are super fast and consistent throughout my house I just can't be even more happier now I do need to mention that you might not see a huge difference moving to Wi-Fi 6 unless if your current household is maxing out on your current network so that's it for me guys that's pretty much been my upgrade pad to Wi-Fi 6 I'm very happy with this needs let me know if you guys are happy with your existing Wi-Fi setup and if you are actually looking into upgrading your Wi-Fi routers would you consider Wi-Fi 6 or a Wi-Fi 6 router let me know the comments down below I me both how it connects thank you so much for watching stay safe and I'll two guys in the next one",

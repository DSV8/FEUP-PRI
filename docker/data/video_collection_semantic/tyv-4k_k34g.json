    "transcript": "in today's video i'm gonna try and beat the most efficient graphics card on the market by clumsily tweaking a less efficient graphics card but first today's video is sponsored by be quiet and their new fx series of products which is basically like their amazing standard products but with rgb be quiet has rgbified their pirok 2 air coolers pure loop 2 aios and purebase 500 cases and considering that they use non-proprietary rgb connectors that should minimize the rgb struggle and the best part about it is to celebrate be quiet's 20th anniversary they've got amazing discounts on these products until the end of september so check the link in the video description for some discounted be quiet goodies thank you be quiet for sponsoring today's video the graphics card that i've tested that gives the most frame rate per watt consumed is this little guy the nvidia rtx a2000 which is a very impressive but very expensive quadro-ish graphics card now basically how nvidia made this graphics card was they binned some rtx 360 dies and then they changed the core configuration a little bit undervaulted the crap out of them and then they were left with the most efficient graphics card on the market today which got me thinking the rtx 3060 isn't a super efficient gpu and under vaulting it aggressively led to the most efficient graphics card so what happens if we under vault the graphics card that is the most efficient graphics card in the world today aside from the little a2000 which according to tech powerups reviews was this graphics card the amd rx 6600 how we're going to start this process is i'm going to drop the a2000 in our testbed back here so that we can see what our target is for this test now with battlefield 5 running at 1080p high settings we are getting almost two frames per watt here that's some crazy stuff i just quickly want to point out here that this multiplayer map gives a much higher frame rate than the single player bit of game that i use for the benchmark runs so if you see a lower average in the benchmarks than you were expecting after this footage that's why and the reason i do this is because the single player gives extremely repeatable results in terms of run to run variants whereas the multiplayer is all over the place oh and i'm not only going to use battlefield 5 because amd and battlefield 5 have quite a hot romance going on and it would be very unfair to the a2000 to only use that i think i'll use gta 5 to balance it out because that seems to have the hots for nvidia so with all those asterisks out the way let's drop the rx 6600 in here in its stock configuration and see what that does but before dropping the rx 6600 into the system i had to do some maths to determine how many frame rates per watt we were getting from the a2000 now i'm no mathematician but on first impression the rx 6600 may be drawing more power but on this more demanding map are we are we getting a high enough frame rate that it's already more efficient than the a2000 let me let me quickly go do a benchmark and see and after furiously crunching the numbers i came to a terrible realization so it seems like with battlefield 5 the rx 6600 is already more efficient than the a2000 which may make for a very awkward and short video but maybe that amd battlefield 5 love affair is just more powerful than we were anticipating so let's try gta 5 and see if that's any different and after doing the gta 5 benchmarks two things became clear first off we still had a video and two game optimization is extremely important to the results we get having said that let's start tweaking the rx 6600 to see how efficient we can get it oh interesting amd's drivers have an auto under vault option let's give that a try oh now um i don't think that's made a whole lot of difference we're still in the high 90s in terms of wattage and the frame rate also looks the same so let's quickly do the oh tank oh tank tank tank uh so let's do the benchmark but i don't think auto overvolting's done a whole lot and no unfortunately the auto under vault didn't make a difference or at least as far as msi afterburner can measure power draw i then tried to manually undervolt the card which also didn't seem to make any measurable difference to the power draw the only thing that happened was when i went under a thousand one hundred millivolts the card would just crash so i set the voltage to a thousand one hundred millivolts and then moved over to the power limit slider which unfortunately only lets us drop the power limit by six percent which is quite disappointing but let's see what difference that makes that's quite an underwhelming drop in power draw but it's less and if we haven't dropped any performance then we would have gained some efficiency on the 6600 yay look at that we did actually get some more frames per watt now unfortunately we can't reduce the power draw anymore it seems like the car doesn't want to use less than 94 watts so instead of reducing the power draw i think our next option is to overclock the graphics card to see if we can get more performance out of that 94 watts so let's let's do that but unfortunately the previous result was the best one i could get if anything overclocking the graphics card just made it run worse no matter what i did to the sliders i couldn't replicate it benchmark after benchmark i was just going backwards and there was no way for me to squeeze additional frame rates out of that 94 watts of power drill which putting the dramatics aside is actually still very impressive because with that little bit of power draw reduction the rx 6600 is a decent smidge more efficient than the a2000 in battlefield v but again that's with battlefield 5 a game that seems to have inappropriately romantic feelings for the rx 6600 and it was already more efficient even before the power draw reduction so let's see if the rx 6600 was able to close the gap with the more demanding use case gta v now in stock configuration with gta 5 the efficiency gap is pretty huge between these two graphics cards because the a2000 and the rx 6600 get about the same frame rate but the a2000 uses 30 watts less power so dropping six percent of the power draw on the rx 6600 isn't going to make much of a difference but hopefully gta 5 takes to the overclocking a bit better okay so fiddling with the lame slider has dropped the power draw the expected amount and if anything we actually gained a bit of frame rate so we get a decent bump in frame per watt but still not nearly enough so let's hope overclocking helps now over the last while trying to overclock the rx 6600 it seems like the core frequency slider doesn't actually change the core frequency in game i think the graphics card is pretty much running as fast as it can in that regard the only thing that's made any in-game difference has been playing around with the memory slider so i've maxed that out and hopefully that'll help us catch the a2000 let's see and with all the sliders maxed we've gained a very impressive three frames per second which means the rx 6600 is still quite far behind the a2000 in terms of efficiency in a game like gta 5. so aside from a very impressive showing from the much cheaper rx 6600 unfortunately i wasn't able to do much tuning to the little card which i'm gonna blame on quite a locked down walkman to be honest regardless it was a much closer race than i was expecting and depending on the game you're playing you may actually have the most efficient graphics card out at the moment which brings me to the end of the video thank you for watching bye foreign",

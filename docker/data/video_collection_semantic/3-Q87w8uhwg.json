    "transcript": "Ive been struggling with a video script for awhile that's suffering from a massive case of scope creep and its bothering me so much that I decided to shelve it for now. But, when one doorcloses this thing might be why! This is a door closer. You see these everywhere in commercial buildings and theyre pretty simple devices. But theres one thing about them not enough people seem to know: theseare adjustable! You can change their closing speed and speed them up to help a door whichisnt latching properly or, get this, slow it wayy down so the door stays open longer and it doesn't slam. Especially if you work in a hotel which is full of these and also people sleeping, that's areally good thing to know! All you need is an Allen wrench or screwdriver and someone to tell you howto do that. And Ill happily play the role of that someone. Ill also talk about why these are there in the first place, how they work, and probably some other stuff. First, let me show you how to adjust these. Luckily, I have one installed on the door to the warehouse. Wait, you have a warehouse? Yep! wwwhy? For storing two of them, but thats not importantright now. Were talking about door closers. So, this door, if I open it to 90 degrees thenlet it go, does this. Its a nice and smooth swing all the way to the end and then, becausetheres no latch hardware in the door right now, the door closer is the only thing holdingthe door shut. Which Im pretty sure is a problem since this is a fire door but Ididnt do that so dont look at me. Now, if we look at the door closer body were going tofind that there are two little holes on the side with an Allen screw in each one. Sometimes there's a cover over the door closer body so if you don't see it right away, you might have to take that cover off. The holes arelabeled L and S. And of I tighten the one labeled S, watch what happens. Now, the dooris closing very slowly. That is, until its almost shut. Once its at about 15degrees, suddenly it speeds up. Whyd it do that? Well, thats kind of the whole point of thoseadjustments. Most door closers like this have two separate speeds: a swing speed (sometimes called sweep speed) and a latch speed. Thats what the Land S stand for (though theyre not always marked the same on every door closer). The swing speed,which is what I just adjusted, is the speed at which it will close the door over the majorityof its travel. You usually want this to be fairly slow to help people with mobility issues orjust to make getting through the door easier when youre holding stuff. And in many jurisdictionsthe swing speed is actually codified. The Americans with Disabilities Act requires that the door take atleast 5 seconds to close from 90 degrees. But when the door is about to shut, youmight need it to speed up a bit to ensure it has enough momentum to successfully engage the latch. Andthats what the latch speed adjustment is for. Right now the latch speed on this closer is prettymoderate. But if I loosen that adjustment screw, the door shuts with a pretty significant thudregardless of how slow the swing speed was. [THUD] And if I tighten that screw, well the door no longer slamsat all. Instead it shuts very gently. You can even adjust these so that the swing speed is fasterthan the latch speed. I dont think theres much reason to do that but if you did, the doorwould swing closed quickly but then slow down right near the end of its travel for a gentle close. And heres what Id really like to youto know: So long as the door will successfully latch under all conditions, you can have these beas gentle as you like. They do not have to slam the door, and in fact the whole reason thisstyle of door closer exists is to keep that from happening! So if you install one of these and dontactually adjust it to the door it's on, youre making it very sad. But lets back up a bit. Why do we wantthe door to close on its own anyway? Well, I already mentioned that this is a fire door and thats one of the main reasons. Fire, it turns out, is bad. There are some placeswhere fire can be ok. Like for instance a fire place. Its really just called fireplace, huh? Er, but where we dont want it, and especially when we dontexpect it, fire is really dangerous. And if a fire breaks out in a building, firedoors are incredibly important for life safety. They compartmentalize a building and keep fire from spreading to other areas, both by being a physical barrier and by restricting the supply ofoxygen to the fire in progress. True fire doors can withstand the intense heat of a fire happeningon the other side of them for more than an hour. But fire doors only work if the door is actuallyshut, so rather than let us forgetful humans forget to close them, we put door closerson them so they always close by themselves. Fun fact, in situations where we want there to be a self-closing fire door but we also want it to stay open during not-fires, electromagnetic doorholder-openers can be installed alongside a door closer. When powered on, these door holders attract a small metal plate attached to the door to hold it open. This is useful in situations such as abuilding with a long hallway that you ordinarily want unbroken for an unimpeded flow of people butwhich should be compartmentalized in the event of a fire to reduce spreading. The electromagnetsare tied to the buildings fire alarm system, so they can be released if it detects a fire inprogress or someone activates it manually. When the system cuts power to those electromagnetsthroughout the building, they all let go of whatever doors theyre holding open and the doorclosers close the doors. And of course this system is fail-safe - the door closers are always trying to close the doors and the door needs to be actively held open, so if the holdingsystem fails for any reason, the doors close. There are, of course, other reasons to keepdoors shut. One of which is security. When theres any kind of restricted accessto a space, even something as relatively low-security as an apartment buildings lobby, you generally want doors to lock automatically and require a specific action to unlock themfrom the outside. But any automatic lock, even something as simple as a keyed doorknob which is always locked from the outside, is pretty useless if the door can be left open. Soyou slap on a door closer to make sure that door always closes behind you and always locks. Of course you can defeat a door closer with a doorstop or... like, a brick but that takes aconscious effort and for people casually coming in and out throughout the day, the doorcloser ensures the building is secured. Actually, quick note about doorstops. They are the enemyof a secure building and also fire safety. The temptation to use them is the reason those electromagnetic door holder opener thingies get installed. When the need to keep the door open isobvious but the need for it to close in a fire is safety critical, theyre a great choice. Butthere are always going to be random situations where you need a self-closing door to be heldopen, so certain people would like me to tell facilities managers about delayed-actiondoor closers. They exist! They act like any other door closer except when you openthe door completely. When opened all the way, an internal mechanism is tripped which holds thedoor open for a minute or two. And then it will close. This is a great compromise for situationslike helping workers who need to move bulky tables into an event space which has criticalfire doors that cannot be left open. Alright and then the last major reason to keep a door shut besides safety and security is energy. It costs moneyto keep buildings heated and cooled, and were not paying to heat the outside! So exterior doors often have door closers to make sure nobody leaves them open and makesDad angry. However, theres a dual-role there in that case. Exterior doors, when left open, can be a lovely supply of oxygen for fires so self-closing exterior doors are not strictlyfor energy saving purposes. But they sure help. Fun fact, the reason revolving doors exist isbecause they are functional airlocks. High-traffic buildings in areas where it gets real cold havethem almost as a rule because the four panels of rotating glass mean the door is never actually open sotheres never a blast of cold air coming in as people enter and exit the building. Just littlesections of air get exchanged. Of course there are accessibility concerns there so generally thereare also standard doors with powered openers for those who need them, but you often find signagethanking you for using the revolving door if you can. Vestibules with a door on each end are another way to achieve air locking - though in order to be truly effective both sets of doors should never be open at the same time. And when the doors are automated, uh that happens a lot. Id kind of like there to be a mode you can turn on in extreme cold which forces people to wait inthe vestibule until the first door has closed but that would be confusing and potentially unsafe so I can understand why Ive never seen that. OK, so with all those particulars out of the way, how is this thing actually closing the door? Well, the answer's simple: With a spring. In fact a simple spring is all you need to keep adoor shut. If you put one somewhere such that it gets compressed as the door opens, then the springis gonna push the door shut once it's let go. And this here is a spring hinge! This is technicallya door closer. Look, it even says UL listed door closer bod. Body. These are fairly common inhousehold environments thanks to building codes. I have a couple on the door between my garage and the rest of my home because that wall is afirewall and you really dont want that door left open in case theres a car fire. Which can happen. These simple hinges containa spring which is compressed as the hinge opens, meaning the hinge will always close unless someone is actively pushing the door open. These work mostly fine but they slam doors. Realbad. When the door is fully open and then let go, it consistently picks up speed as it travels and by the end of its travel its moving quite fast. So when it meets the frame [SLAM] theresquite a bang. Thats of course annoying but also can cause injuries if people get theirfingers in the wrong place at the wrong time. That has even caused lawsuits when they wereused in public places and public fingers got publicly pinched in public. And besides thatlittle issue, these dont always latch the door. The spring in these isnt very strong. I mean itseems quite strong when this isn't attached to a door but with the massive amount of leverage adoor provides the spring hinges dont push back with all that much force, so if you let a door gowhen its already close to its closed position, these will hold it mostly shut but they may not have enough oomph to actually engage the latch. So eventually we got these things! Thesealso have springs, but theres a twist. A second mechanism is fighting the spring to regulate thespeed at which this closes the door. There were several different ways that was accomplishedover the years, and some of the alternatives to this one still survive. But this hydraulicmechanism is by far the most common we see today. The actual closing force is provided by a springpushing on a sliding rack. That rack engages with a pinion gear which this arm is attachedto. When I force the arm in this direction, the rotating pinion slides the rack such thatthe spring is compressed. And when I let go, the spring pushes the rack back in the other directionand the arm returns to its original position. But the rack the spring pushes on is also attached to a piston inside a hydraulic cylinder filled with oil. And thats where the speed controlcomes from. When you push the door open, a check valve opens which allows the fluid topass from one end of the cylinder to the other, thus the piston can travel through the hydraulic fluid mostly unimpeded. But when it starts moving backwards via the force of the spring, thatvalve closes and now the piston is stuck. The hydraulic fluid has locked it in place. But there are two additional paths oil can take to move between the two halves of thecylinder. And those paths each have a valve inside which can restrict the flow of the fluid. And guess where those valves are? Here and here. The latch and swing speed adjustments are in fact valves which, when turned, increase or decrease the speed at which fluidcan flow through them. And that in turn restricts the speed of the closing mechanism. When youtighten these valves, you restrict that flow more which slows the mechanism down. In fact you cancompletely close them and, well, the door closer then becomes truly stuck. Or you can completelyopen them and then the spring is basically free to close the door as fast as it can. Careful,though, because you can remove these plugs and thatll let the hydraulic fluid out which is A)unpleasant and 2) will break the door closer. Actually, on that note, if you ever see oneof these on a door with streaks of grossness coming down from it, the seals inside have probablyfailed and the hydraulic fluid leaked out. That door closer needs to be replaced ifyou dont want it to slam because, well, its damping mechanism is effectively gone. But anyway, the two different closing speeds are achieved by the differing paths of the oilbypasses. During the bulk of the doors travel, the latch speed bypass doesnt actually do anything becauseboth of its ports are on the pressurized side of the cylinder. But once the piston gets past thispoint, those ports are now on either side of it so they become a second bypass with its own dedicatedspeed setting. Pretty simple and pretty clever. But its not actually that simple. I want to makeyou aware of some particulars which are important to keep in mind both when making adjustmentsand when installing a door closer. For a start, these come in different sizes which reallyjust means different spring strength. The spring inside here is the only thing that actually produces closing force so you need to make sure it provides the appropriate amount. Wider andbigger doors need stronger springs than smaller, narrower doors. And when you encounter a doorthats heavy - its likely got a door closer on there thats just too big for it and you cantexert enough leverage to easily overcome the spring. Then again, some models - including thisone - allow you to adjust the spring tension so this is sold as sizes 1 through 4, appropriate forany interior door up to 3 feet six inches wide. Now, while the spring is the only thing directlyproviding closing force, thanks to our old pal momentum the doors speed as it closes willaffect its latching force and thats why the latch speed adjustment exists. If theres a doorwhich needs a bit of a shove to positively latch, this will give it that shove. If the latchoperates smoothly and the door fits well within its frame, that shouldnt be necessary, though. Thespring force alone will shut the door, but theres a weird extra thing to consider which is easyto miss: in modern buildings, HVAC systems can produce air pressure imbalances between rooms orbetween the inside and outside. If those pressure imbalances are significant enough, they can overcome the spring force and keep the door from completely closing. This means that a door closerwhich gently and successfully latches a door in some conditions might not latch it when the HVACsystem is running, and in that case you have to adjust it for the worst case scenario and therewill be times it closes with a bit of a slam. And by the way, I have not touched the adjustments on this door closer and watch how it behaves out of the box. Yeah, this would absolutelyslam a door without adjusting the latch speed. But when you consider that the manufacturerof this is most concerned with its products doing their basic job in as many situationsas possible, it makes sense that theyd sell them with the latch valve pretty wideopen. Theyre counting on the installers to make that adjustment when its possible, but lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of people just never touch it. Askanyone who has ever stayed in a hotel. Fun fact, I used to work in the hotel industry andone of the first things I did at a new property when I had some time on a slow day was go aroundthe building and adjust all the door closers so they didnt slam anymore. Almost none of them hadbeen touched at all since the hotels were built, so almost every guestroom door slammed shutwith quite the bang. Same with the stairwell doors. And thats pretty annoying in the middle of the night, so I simplytook the time (which wasnt that much time at all) to go around, open every door, and adjust theclosers. I slowed them down as much as I could while making sure that they latched properly, and thenI sped them up just a tad to account for varying conditions. Some doors had trouble latchingand I had to leave them slamming somewhat, but I was able to silence the vast majority ofthe doors. It wasnt much of a task, but nobody had thought to do that, and this is why you needa weird obsessive nerd somewhere on your staff! Now, to be honest, this bugbear of mine is themain reason I made this entire video and mostly Im concerned with people knowing how to adjustdoor closers which already exist. But I would like to briefly talk about mounting these to a door because thats way more complicated than it seems at first glance. Youll notice that the piniongear which actually turns the door closer arm has attachments coming out on both the top and the bottom ofthe body. Thats because some doors are hinged on the right, while others are hinged on the left, sowhich way you need the arm to swing will change. But also, you may need this installed onthe push side of a door or the pull side of the door. And sometimes you need to mountthe closer body to the frame of the door and other times you need to attach it to the dooritself. And youll also need to decide if you want the door to only open to 90 degrees orif you want a full 180 degree swing. All of those factors change how you need to mountthis, which linkages you need, and how long those linkages need to be, and how they behave, and its confusing. These arethe instructions for mounting this door closer, and while its not rocket surgeryits more involved than youd think. And as with any rabbit hole you go down, it just keepsgoing. This is by far the most common type of door closer but there are many, many more. Someare installed in the floor so they can operate frameless doors, others are concealed withinthe door jamb which provides a sleeker look. Im sure many of those are adjustable in the same way as this but Im gonna leave that to you to figure out. Oh right, and also many door closers havea back-check adjustment. Often labeled BC, that provides some speed restriction as you openthe door. It generally only kicks in at the very end of the doors sweep to slow it down before itopens completely. This can be a necessary thing, especially on exterior doors which mightfling open if the wind catches them, but it also prevents door flinging humans from damaging your doors by stomping out particularly angrily. Then of course there are powered door closerswhich also open doors, often activated with a button near them. They use an electric motorto open the door and hold it open for a short while before letting it close again, whichmakes entering and exiting a building easier for wheelchair users or anyone who might needhelp with a door. You dont often see those as much as you used to, at least in my area, since mostbusinesses have chosen to have fully automatic doors which respond to motion sensors, butthey stick around in lots of places where traffic volume doesnt justify going thatfar yet which require disability access. Ive mostly been focusing on commercial door closers but there are some common types youfind at home. I already mentioned these spring hingesbut if youve got a screen door its probably got one of these door closers on there so itdoesnt flap about in a storm. This is just a spring in a tube pulling on this stick, andwhen you pull the stick out the spring fights you and pulls the stick back inside. It usesair pressure to dampen the springs return, and even these are adjustable! At least, manyof them are. This one has a screw at the back which you can tighten to restrict the flow of air leavingthe cylinder which slows it down. But then at the end you get a little toot. [toot] Turns out this has alatching speed, too! Though thats not adjustable. But at this point, Im just rattling on so whydont we give this video a proper ending where it comes to a close? I had to, okay? I wantto give a shout-out to Deviant Ollam who I reached out to after watching this amazingtalk of his on fire codes. I figured hed probably have a good list of door closer trivia and he delivered most excellently so thank you for your script consultancy. Thereare a lot of things in our everyday lives that are just there and youre not gonna think ofunless somebody brings them to your attention. And it is my sincere hope that at least a fewfacilities managers out there (or just bored people who work in buildings) give their door closers a little love so they can stop annoying people as they do their very important jobs. adjustably smooth jazz This might be why! This is not gonna work. I screwed that uuuuuuup. ...speed them up to help a doorwhich isnt lassing prop [painful sigh] brrrr ...and speed them up to help a doorwhich isnt lapping prop crfff brrrp! So dont look at me. Now, if we look at the doorcloser body. I dont like that deliver AT all. And in fact the whole reason this style of [bleep] These do not have to slam the door! And in fact the whole reason they exist I need to back up because I skipped a very important caveat. installing a door closer. For astart [thud] these well that was ...wonderful. Good time was had by all, I'm pooped! Yes, I should be - good lord what is happening in there? See, now that's why you need door closers. To localize the aurora borealis entirely within the kitchen. It just makes sense!",

    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and today is a very exciting video. This video's actually sponsored by LG. So a huge thank you to them for supporting my channel and making this video possible, because this is something that I've really wanted to do in my house, for a very long time. I love technology, I love smart homes, and there were some things in my house that weren't quite smart. Like my washer, my dryer. Thankfully, most of my TVs were smart televisions, but this one specifically, has the ThinQ AI technology built into it. I also have the LG Styler. This is a really interesting product and something that I never really even thought about ever getting for myself. There's so many different use cases for this and I think for a lotta people, this could be the perfect solution for not having to go to the dry cleaner. I did see this at CES, so it was kinda cool to actually have it here in my house to get to try out. So for this video, we're gonna kinda focus on the ThinQ app and how it integrates so well with all of the LG appliances and gadgets that they have in their ecosystem. So today we're gonna be focusing on the four that I just got. I also got one of the new LG Velvet phones. And the best part about this, is the fact that all of these devices are able to integrate with one single app. So not only are you able to start and stop your washer or the LG Styler, I can also control the television right here from my phone, from the ThinQ app, but also something that's kind of neat, as you guys can see behind me, on this TV. This is the LG CX 77 inch, class 4K, Smart OLED TV and you can see over here, my dryer has 29 minutes to go, my washer is off because I just put the clothes in the dryer and my Styler is actually doing a sanitize right now of some of my dog toys. Well, they're not my dog, my dog's toys. And what's really cool about this is if I'm watching TV or I'm playing a video game, I'm able to get a notification that'll let me know when my washer is done or my dryer or anything else that is connected to the television. If there is notification or an alert, it'll pop up on the TV, on my phone and then I'm able to take action from there. (upbeat music) I'm excited about the Styler for a lot of different reasons, mostly because I actually don't own an iron and this has a really cool refresh steam setting. So I can put in my t-shirts or my sweaters or anything that kinda needs a little refresh. It also sanitizes, but it's not a replacement for a washer and dryer. Think of this kind of as a little refresh in between washes. Also, for a lot of people who wear business suits, which I don't, ever, this would be so perfect. It has this little pants press, pants crease care system, to crease and keep those slacks looking real slacklicious. I don't know much about wearing nice pants. I know that a lot of people do wear a lotta nice pants, which means this is a perfect pants solution for your pants. Also for your tops and your blazers. It's like a refrigerator for your clothes. This is actually my kitchen right now, which works really well for me because my laundry room is right over there. But I've seen a lot of instances where people put this in their closet, so as you're sorting through your clothing you can just pop this in the Styler and it can be refreshed and ready for the day. So let's do a little demo. I'm gonna put in a few items. Look at this t-shirt. Wrinkled, not sanitized, we're gonna put this on one of these LG Styler hangers, super fancy, hang that up. This is something I'm very excited about, for a very specific use case, for maybe not everyone, but for my jiu jitsu gi. So I definitely recommend putting these in the washer so that it is extra clean. To have a little extra sanitizing can never hurt and it might get the wrinkles out because this material is so stiff. This has so many different options. There's refresh, special care, for suits, pants, or sanitary, so you can put bedding in here. There's also a gentle dry, so if you have a bathing suit or some type of thing like that, you can also do that to get that nice and dry. But the best part is it all connects with the ThinQ app. We're gonna do a light refresh. Here we go. Our steam is preparing and it says our estimated end time is at 8:57 AM. (upbeat music) Obviously, I can control my washer and dryer with my app so I don't actually have to be right next to them, but for the sake of the demonstration, I am gonna show you how you can use the ThinQ app, right here next to them. But I could be on the couch, I could be upstairs, I could be watching TV. I could be eating a meal at the mall, check on the status of my clothes in the washer. That's the future. Hopefully in the future, we can actually go back to the mall, but right now I'm just going to enjoy doing a little dryer action over here. The Styler is almost done. It's kinda cool 'cause you can actually see how much time is left on the app. There is a remote start button on here, so you do have to have that activated, so you are able to control it through your phone. So let's do a quick little dryer action. There you go, 25 minutes for that speed dry and while that's happening, let's load up some of my laundry that I've been saving all week, for this very moment. (upbeat music) Okay, I'm gonna start my washer. We have a minute left on the Styler. This this cool because it does have remote locks, so if the remote lock is active, this will actually lock so that no one is able to access this, after you have remote locked. So you can go away. (phone ringing) It's done, the Styler cycle is complete. Oh my gosh, let's see how our items are. Oh, it feels so nice and warm and toasty in here. It's winter right now in LA, so probably won't be wearing a t-shirt. Usually this material is super stiff, so this kinda made it nice and cozy. Now I'm gonna do a sanitary run and I don't actually like to wash my belt every single time that I do a class, so this can be kinda cool, I can just toss this in with any other items. Maybe let's put one to Matty's toys in there. This thing he's had since he was a baby, so this is over five years old. I don't even know if I want that to touch my belt, that's saying a lot. So if we do a normal run, this takes about an hour and 28 minutes and heavy duty for two 13. I feel like we'll just do a normal hour 28. Get this all super sanitized for me and Matty. I'll see you soon. It's also kinda cool because now I'm here filming this video and I know that in 26 minutes, my dryer will be ready and I can go get my clothes. So this is the app and you can see we've got our Styler, our TV and the dryer and the washer and I can control the TV. So watch this, I'm gonna turn it off. Oh, look at that. That was actually really fast. What I really like is you can also use your voice, so I can actually just search. iJustine, LG, YouTube, unboxing. I don't actually have to type anything. Look at this, look at our options. Oh my gosh, this is where we are right now. Look how different it looks. I still have that carpet. Really crazy looking at this from so long ago. It's not even that long. So right here, you can see this is where you click in to go to your home dashboard, and this will give you entire look at everything that is connected to your home. I can actually go to my LG Velvet and I can screen-share. Look at this, it's currently connecting to the mobile device. Yes, accept. Oh my gosh, we're screen-sharing. Look, there it is. See this, look at this, I'm controlling my phone with my TV. Can you guys believe this? I'm controlling my phone with the TV, right now. The best part about this is everything is just integrated right into your phone. You can set up different rooms. You can add the Styler, the dryer, and the washer all into its own room. Well, thank you guys so much for watching, I would love to hear from you guys, do you have a smart home? What is some future tech that you would like to upgrade in your home? And what do you guys think of ThinQ? Have any of you guys used this before? Do you have any LG products that you can potentially connect to the app? I would love to hear all of it and more, in the comments below. But now I need to go get my clothes, 'cause they're about to be done in 14 minutes, incredible. (upbeat music)",

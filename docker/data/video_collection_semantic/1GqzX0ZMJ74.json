    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and WWDC 2022 it's actually here. I'm actually shocked because I don't even know where this year went. The fact that it is already June is beyond my comprehension. I can't believe it. It's also really wild to think that for the past couple of years, WWDC has been all strictly online and not just WWDC, basically every single event that any tech company has done, it's all been virtual. While leading off this year with one of the biggest events was Google IO and Google decided to have it in person. There was a ton of code precautions put in place that they were able to have this event. And it looks like Apple is having a select group of media attend this year. And I could not be more excited, like I'm trying to keep calm because sometimes my excitedness comes off a little aggressive. So this is me playing the part of a calm person who is going to be going to WWDC this year, I am so excited. I just think back to the first WWDC that I went to and it was everything that I could have ever hoped for, it was a dream come true. As a child, that's all I ever wanted to do. I wanted to live, I wanted to be in Cupertino, I wanted to be near Apple campus. (chuckles) And now as an adult, I don't know if that that's, I don't think I wanna actually live next door to the Apple campus, but it has been really fun to get a chance to go to Apple and really experience it firsthand. So super grateful. And the fact that there will be some people in attendance at WWDC this year is very, very exciting. Enough of that, of course, you guys will see a bunch of my posts so be sure to follow me on Twitter and Instagram and all of the places where I'll be posting WWDC updates. But today we're gonna talk about some rumors. And I feel like at this point, we kind of know what to expect at WWDC. It is a developer's conference. This is an event that sets up the next year, the next two years of software to get developers thinking about ways to start implementing all of these new features into the software that they're creating. I feel like one of the highlights for me is the latest iOS updates. And iOS 16, and yes, iOS 16 will be the next release that is coming out. And ah, that's wild, like 16 iOS releases. I feel like this video is just gonna turn into a little jot down memory lane of how did we get here? Is this what it's like to get old, to sort of reflect on your past life, except I'm not reflecting on life, I'm reflecting on all over the past iOS systems that I have used and all of the features and all of the upgrades in each one. So, I mean, maybe my perspective is a little skewed. Hmm. Are always surprised? A no. So of course I am on Mac Rumors right now, one of my favorite websites to get all of the latest Mac news, Mac rumors, it's literally called Mac Rumors and I've been on this website since a child. Like I was a child reading this website from my parents, I don't wanna say, actually it was in their basement. That's a whole nother story. They put the computer in the basement because I was misbehaving. And they thought that it was like a punishment, (tranquil ambient music) but man, I freaking loved being in the basement. I had a recliner chair, I had privacy. I could play my music loud. So what they thought was a punishment and then I wouldn't wanna go and be on the computer, it was actually a vacation. (laughing) How long has this video been going? Have I talked about anything yet? It's really hard to say. So at the time of recording this on Mac Rumors, it's interesting because in past years, they're stating that iOS has leaked early, but this year it hasn't happened yet. But here's some of the new features that they're thinking that we'll be seeing, we'll see overhaul lock screens with wallpapers that have widget like capabilities. 'Cause I do feel like the Apple lock screens are kind of, I mean, they're not really that engaging. You have your notifications, you have your time. So to be able to update those lock screens and customize it. Yeah, I'm into that. Significant improvements in notifications. They don't have specific details. We love a significant update. The messages app with social network like functionality with specific feature on audio messages. Okay, we need to talk or, I'll continue in a second, but I have this crippling panic when somebody sends me an audio message because it doesn't transcribe it. And I don't like to listen to messages, I don't like voicemail, I don't like phone calls to be honest with you. So when I get a voice memo, it's like a tiny voicemail. It's basically a voicemail, but it's a tiny one, but sometimes it's very long. And if I listen to it, and I don't click so that it doesn't expire, I then don't remember what this person said and the fact that it doesn't transcribe it, I can't remember it. So in my mind, it's like it never happened. So what I tend to do is if someone sends me one, an apologies to any of my friends watching this and you've sent me a voice memo and I probably didn't listen to it out of fear, out of panic. And it's the weirdest thing, I can't even explain it, but honestly, anytime someone sends one, I'm just like, ugh. I just think that they should be transcribed like voicemails because then I can decide if I want to listen to it or not. Anyway, we're on to only the fourth bullet point, health app with expanded sleep tracking functionality and medicine management. That's interesting. Apple is working on a tool that will let users scan their pill bottles into the app. Plus there's a new women's health feature expected. So this is cool. I'm into this because I would love if you could scan the pills and it would give you a notification of when you're supposed to take it and then you can check off, be like, yes, I took this. Having recently now a person who is on blood thinners that I have to take twice a day. I normally almost always remember but over the past two months, there's been one time that I forgot because I just fell asleep and completely forgot to take it. If there is this sort of check-in option, that's like, hey, have you taken your blood thinners yet today? And I don't click it, it can keep sending you reminders. That would be awesome. Some new Apple apps are in the work. They're also working on new ways of system interaction. Not quite clear what that means, I don't know either. New fitness plus workout types. Oh, freaking yes. Apple Music classical app with interface based on, (mumbles) I don't know what that is to be honest with you. Next we have some possible features on iPhone 14 rumors. Yep, we read that right, iPhone 14. It's gonna be here before you guys know it. You're gonna see your feeds spammed with iJustine and iPhone content as per usual, and I cannot wait. So there's an always on display for iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max, a revamped status bar interface to accommodate the whole punch and pill design that is expected to replace the notch, which is it's here, it's time. I think that the notch may finally, we may say bye-bye, bye. A car crash detection feature which would dial emergency services when a collision is detected, this would require a new iOS 16 functionality. This is something that I'm interested in, Apple may add a satellite based emergency feature to iPhone 14, which would be supported in iOS 16. I have spent so much money on a monthly GPS service from Garmin just to have as like a just in case, as an emergency when I hike. Thankfully I've never had to use it. I almost had to once. And I got this thing after I got stranded in this crazy hike in the middle of the night, we didn't make it back, didn't have any cell reception. And I was like, that is something that I need to invest in. So if that is something that Apple is thinking about doing or has plans, maybe not this specific release on iPhone 14, but maybe in the future. Hmm, so here for it, definitely think it's a great idea, but also satellite coverage would probably be an additional fee. So I feel like that would be something additional that you would have to pay for, it wouldn't probably be a package deal with any of your service providers. iOS 6 could include support for buy now pay later feature for Apple Pay, could introduce support for hardware subscription program that will let customers pay a monthly fee for iPhone, iPad, iMac. Next, we have iPad OS 16 saying that iPad OS will get many of the features that were introduced in iOS 16, but Apple is also working on additional functionality that's iPad specific. What could it be? I love my iPad, I know I've talked about this in some previous videos, but I have been using my iPad so much more this year for drawing and doing illustration work. I've been working on this NFT project, it's called \"@jpig\", we'll just call it \"jpig\", not @, but there's an @ in front of it. If you wanna follow it on Twitter and Instagram, it's \"jpig.farm\". So kind of just using the iPad and learning to use Procreate and Illustrate and it's just sort of been this new fun skill that I've kind of developed over the past couple of months. And it has been so fun. They're also saying with iPad OS 16, they're trying to make the iPad behave a little bit more like a laptop than a smartphone with new iPad software, this will be one of the biggest updates announced at WWDC. I like the way that my iPad works. I feel like if we're gonna start making the iPad more like a Mac, maybe we should also make the Mac more like an iPad so that I can a touch screen on the Mac, because why not? There's still two very different devices. I also love the magic keyboard, but this magic keyboard is not good if you want to put this on your lap and type and take notes, that's not something that I've kind of been struggling with. So I feel like a new magic keyboard design would be something that I would absolutely love to see, because I love the magic keyboard, I love the keyboard, I love the track pad, I love having that additional USBC port. But it needs to have better balance, especially for the Pro. We're also talking about some potential updates to a redesigned multitasking interface to make it easier to switch between tasks, to see which apps are open. You can resize windows and Apple also plans to implement new ways for users to deal with multiple apps at once. Yeah, we're gonna make the iPad into a Mac, then the Mac into an iPad and then basically we'll have two separate things, so just kind of like doing a flat computer, or do you want a laptop? I don't know. MacOS 13. So what do we think the macOS 13 is gonna be called? So it's not too much that has linked so far about macOS 13, but they're saying there's gonna be a new system preferences, revamp some of the default apps, improvements to messages, mail, Safari. Messages in particular is rumored to be getting social networking functions as we talked about in iOS 16, I wonder what that can be. I don't know, but I'm excited about it. Here's a rumor for the naming convention of the new macOS 13 Mammoth. So saying way back in 2013, registered trademarks for a lot of California landmarks, and Mammoth is one that has not been used. So my friends, hmm. Could it be watch OS-9, freaking love my Apple Watch. Ugh, just, hmm, I'm always so excited when there's any new Apple Watch updates. Updated power saving mode that will allow for the use of apps and features while cutting down on battery usage. Expanded atrial fibrillation detection feature with added burden. How often a person is in estate of atrial fibrillation across a period of time. I love my Apple Watch if I mentioned that. Absolutely love it. I think it's such an incredible device. And this paired with my Oura Ring. I mean, these are my two favorite tech devices other than my iPhone. Like, I just feel like this helps keep me on track, keeping my steps. It also is very good at letting me know when I feel a little stressed out. It's like, hey, maybe you should take a breath. And I'm like, oh, you're right, I should. Improved health and activity tracking more, workout types, additional metrics for running workouts and a refresh for existing watch faces. tvOS 16 says tvOS doesn't often get as many new features as other system updates. You may be able to do more with your smart home products through Apple TV, following the launch of an update. Love that. There have been a ton of rumors of, will there be some hardware announcements at WWTC? Now this would not be the first time that we've had a hardware announcement. See if you guys remember back in 2019, which was actually at WWTC that I was at when they announced the Mac Pro, which was so exciting. You may remember at the spring event that they announced the Mac Studio, which is such an incredible powerful little device, but they were like, hey, yeah, you think of that's cool. Hold on a second, you haven't seen anything yet because the Mac Pro is coming soon. Hmm. (grunts) So maybe they'll give us a small preview, I mean, if they gave us that kind of little tease at the spring event, then maybe they'll give us a little bit more. I don't know, I'm hoping, I don't know, it's hard to say, we really don't know. I'm literally just, I know as much as you do, now you know what I know, because I've read it on the internet. Don't always believe everything that you read on the internet. Speaking of things that you shouldn't believe, I'll just continue to read some more rumors. They're suggesting the Mac Pro will feature a chip even more powerful than the M1 Ultra used in the Mac Studio. It's expected to feature 40 CPU cores and 128 graphics cores, which would make it twice as powerful as the M1 Ultra. At some point, just do my job for me. Speak, just be me, just be me. I can't be myself, you're too powerful. Just do my job for me. They're also saying that Apple could introduce an M1 Ultra successor that is in fact two M1 Ultra chips linked together, because the M1 Ultra is essentially just two M1 Max chips connected together. So like, why don't we just keep this going? It's just like a little puzzle, a very complex beautiful puzzle. So Mac Rumors is seeming to think that if they are gonna introduce any hardware, that it's gonna be the MacBook Air. They are reportedly aiming to introduce the MacBook Air at the event, but COVID related supply chain issues in China could prevent them from doing so. The next gen MacBook Air is expected to feature a total design overhaul with a Mac Pro like shape that does away with the tapered body. I like the tapered body. It'll be thinner and lighter. We like that. It's expected to come in multiple colors. We like that. The Macbook Air is expected to feature your slim offwhite bezels and a matching off-white keyboard. Oh, so kind of, sort of looking like the new iMac, the M1 is beautiful. Just love those things. It'll probably be equipped with the next gen M2 chip, of course it'll have speed improvements, rumored to have improved graphics. The M2 chip would be the first upgrade after the M1. So I think that we kind of thought that they were gonna announce the M2, but instead they went with the M1 Ultra. So we kind of skipped that. So I feel like now we're kind of in that phase where the M2 would make sense. And I feel like starting that with the MacBook Air would also make sense so that we can then go from the M2 and basically go through that whole refresh cycle of all of the devices throughout next year. Does that make sense? Are you following? I'm following. I see you. Those supply chain issues could hinder the release of this or their plans to put the M2 in the MacBook Air. Hard to say, we will know soon enough, and I cannot wait. And last but not least, AR VR headsets. It has been rumored for a really long time, but what will it look like? Will it be something like this kind of like the Oculus or will it be something just sort of like simple glasses that it kind of augments what you see? They could be fashionable, they don't have to look like an actual headset because I almost think that I'm gonna prefer for like a daily kind of, just something that I'm gonna wanna wear. I don't want to be in VR. I'd like to be in my kind of space. Don't get me wrong, I like VR, but until it's done properly where I don't feel like I'm gonna throw up and I can actually last in it longer than a couple of hours, I've tried, I've started working my way up to trying to get used to it but it's still very, very tough. So I feel like if you do have a sensitivity to motion, that's gonna be the hurdle and the challenge in the upcoming years is how do we make this accessible to more people who are sensitive to these types of things? Even with Google Glass, I do remember that there was kind of like a learning curve too. Like I started getting headaches because of like the focus distance that you had to focus on, like a little eye piece that was sort of close to your eye. So if I'm looking at you guys far away, I would then have to sort of shift my gaze up, but then focus close up. So it's like this weird kind of thing that is not natural at all. So I'm excited to see kind of what Apple decides to come up with to sort of make this something that's comfortable for users. A trademark for \"realityOS\", which is the operating system for the headset was discovered recently. Hmm. It features a forward filing date, deadline of June 8th, 2022, this legal requirement and it appears that the date is unrelated to WWDC. It's a coincidence. Is it a coincidence? Is it? I'm gonna ask it again, is it a coincidence? Well, that about sums up some of the rumors the people who have been talking about, most specifically here on Mac Rumors and I'm very excited for the event. Of course, like I said, in the beginning, make sure you guys follow me so you'll see all of my posts. I'm very excited to see some new faces and some older friends at WWDC. And I can't believe it's gonna be here before we know it. Let me know in the comments below if there's anything that you're looking forward to. What rumors have you heard, and do you think there's gonna be a hardware announcement? If so, what do you think it's gonna be? Leaving those comments below and I will see you guys in the next video.",

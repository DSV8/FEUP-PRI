    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine, and today's video is going to be so much fun. A huge thank you to Best Buy for sponsoring this video. My sister and I are actually in Hawaii right now. And while we've been here, one of my favorite Android phones has been released. This is the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip3 5G. And, I have loved the Samsung Flip lineup, so I'm so excited to really get a chance to test this out in such a beautiful location. A huge out to Best Buy again for partnering with me on this video, they are always my go-to for all the latest and greatest tech. And if you guys want to get more information about the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip3 5G and Best Buy, I'll put a link in the description. But now, we are going to take this thing out on an adventure. I've already shot some sample footage when I was testing this out originally, when I did my first unboxing. So I can't wait to take this out and test it even further. We gotta pack up, Jen, we gotta pack up. (tropical music plays) [Jenna] Surfing! Do you think I'd bring this? I'ma bring this. I'm gonna do a little boogieing on this board. - [Jenna] We do have the latest IPX 8 on these devices. - [Justine] You want one? - [Jenna] No. - [Justine] You're gonna boogie. - [Jenna] I'm not. (cooler snaps shut) That's great, I just set the Flip down, just like this so I can use it as a tripod to get this shot putting stuff in the car. She told me not to bring the boards. We're bringin' the boards! (upbeat music plays) The first stop on our journey, we're gonna get lunch. (music continues) I think we might be doing a food tour of the island, at this point on the North Shore. We planned on going hiking, but now we've just eaten. And now we're getting shave ice from the place that is supposedly the best shave ice on the island. So let's go get some pictures of that. (music continues) [Justine] Oh, wow! Thank you. Let's feast. I've been having so much fun testing this phone out, and I think one of the things that I love so much is actually being able to have this in my hands and be able to see how incredible the screen looks. And one of the things that I've seen repeatedly come up is people talking about the crease. Now this is crazy, because in this video, you can see it. But when you're actually using this, like in-person, it's there, but it's also not there. And I think in videos and photos, it is more prominent for whatever reason, but honestly, I hardly even notice that it's there. I mean, you're folding a phone, like, come on. Like what? It's so cool. One of the things I love about Best Buy is obviously, it is my number one go-to place whenever I need to get anything tech-wise, even here on the island, like there are Best Buys here, and if they don't have it in store, it is something that I can also get online. And what I do love about the in-store experience, especially going back to this Samsung Z Flip3, is seeing this phone in person and really experiencing it and actually folding it and flipping it and seeing how beautiful this display is. It's just something that you really need to see to really understand how cool it is. Like, I can sit here and tell you all day how awesome this screen looks. And that's why I think actually going and seeing it, because this is something that I feel like you really need to experience firsthand. Another cool thing about Best Buy is they do have all of their knowledgeable blue shirts who are there to help. So if you have any questions about this device or anything in general, they're there to help you with their knowledgeable customer service. I really like the portrait mode video. So this was kind of interesting, cause I tried this out at a waterfall, and my hair was all over the place. I was really surprised how well it actually did blurring out the backgrounds, but yet keeping me in focus. Looking at my photos, I'm just kind of scrolling through, and everything looks so crisp and clear and vibrant. (relaxed string music plays) I also filmed this little time-lapse and to get this shot, I didn't have a tripod or anything. So I just folded my phone, just like this. And I set it on its side and that's what I used to get this shot. I'm actually very impressed with how well the portrait mode does on this, but this just shows you how well it did at identifying me and the background and making sure I'm in focus, and the background is not. I also love how quick and easy this is to capture content. Like, I could just pull this out of my pocket, double click the power button, and that'll automatically bring up this front facing camera. So with this, I can tap to take a photo, I can swipe and this will switch it into video mode. So I can instantly start recording and not even have to open my phone up at all. And I'd love this because it's not invasive. It's actually kind of nice to hold this just like this and not have to completely open the phone. Like, look at that! It's really cool. So for some of the tech specs, for those of you who may be curious, this is a 6.7 inch infinity flex full HD plus Dynamic AMOLED 2X display. The cover is a 1.9 inch Super AMOLED display. This has 8GB of RAM and you can configure it to either 128 or 256 GB, and it has a 3,300 milliamp-hour battery. This also has 120 Hertz display, which looks incredible when you're scrolling, watching content, or even playing games. The front camera is a 10 megapixel and these rear cameras are 12 megapixel wide and ultra wide. We're doing this trail we've never done before. It's a botanical garden, which I thought would be so perfect to get some cool photos of some flowers and some trees in the nature. - [Justine] Look at this tree! - [Jenna] It's so cool! (upbeat music plays) - [Justine] What is this? What is it? - [Jenna] It's a ficus vosca, a part of the mulberry family. - [Justine] This is a very, very, whoa! Very cool tree. - [Jenna] Do you think this is fungus, or this is like tree disease actually? - [Justine] I don't know. - [Jenna] Pretty sure that's tree disease. - [Justine] You think? - [Jenna] Yeah. So this is director's view, so I can choose how I would like to direct this feature with my little picture in picture. Hi, Jen. - [Jenna] Hello! - So do we like, look at this tree. So we'll get up real close. Check that out. Let's see far away. Nice. - [Jenna] Pretty cool. - Nice. This is great. (upbeat music continues) Oh man. All right. So I'm back from my adventure with the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip3, this thing has been so much fun to test out. And right now, I'm actually using the video tracking feature to end this video. And this feature is so awesome. Look at me! I'm moving around. With the ultra wide camera, when I'm recording the video, it's able to keep me in view. Anyway, thank you guys so much for watching. I hope that you enjoyed this video. One of the other things that I was actually very surprised about is the durability of this, because this one, I feel like they definitely stepped it up. Having it be water resistant has made such a huge difference, obviously being here in Hawaii. Again, this is a phone that you really have to just go and feel and see for yourself and see how awesome it is. I know a lot of other reviewers kind of had that same sentiment, because it really is an experience checking this out. So if you guys do get a chance, check out your local Best Buy and go in and check out this phone and let me know what you guys think. Well, thank you guys again for watching and I will put a link in the description. If you want more information about Best Buy and the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip3 5G. I had so much fun reviewing this and I can't wait to continue on making some fun content with it. See you guys in the next video, bye! (upbeat music plays)",

    "description": "Get Your iFixit ProTech Toolkit! -  Build Your Own (parts/instructions)! -    macOS is a pretty great operating systemwith apps like Final Cut Pro X, Logic, Alfred, Pixelmator, and more, it's no wonder that Apple's Mac lineup has seen such loyalty. That said, iMac is not cheap, neither is MacBook Pro, or even Mac mini! In this video, Snazzy Labs builds a High Sierra hackintosh (and shows you how to make a hackintosh) designed to outperformor at least hang withApple's entire lineup: for less than $350! That's a pretty sweet hackintosh build!  Follow Snazzy Labs on Twitter!  Follow me on Instagram!",

    "transcript": "My most popular video of 2017 without a doubt was my $70 hackintosh build. It was a computer that I hacked together using used parts that I had acquire from a university inventory surplus and various Craigslist ads. If you're on a budget you'll always get more bang for your buck if you buy used, however a common complaint of my last video was that it wasn't easily replicable. So I'm back with the best new hackintosh you can build using new parts for less than $350. Now with this price constraint especially given the ludicrous component pricing in early 2018 I had to make some compromises in areas that I felt weren't as important like the case and aesthetics, that may not be a jaw-dropping stunner like some of my past builds, but it's the most power you'll find at this price point that manages to hang with Apple's current lineup. Yeah for 350 bucks! This video is sponsored by iFixit and their incredible Pro Tech Toolkit, a necessity for anyone wanting to build a PC, get yours through the link below. If you're interested in this build for yourself parts and instructions are available through the link below and yes prices on PC parts fluctuate frequently especially in this market so if you can't match the price of a part that I've used in this build you can swap it out with something else and I'll provide a few alternate suggestions as well. Now for our motherboard I went cheap the Gigabyte GA-H110 micro ATX. Now this board is great for hackingtoshing, and it will do pretty much everything we need to do but it is really really bare-bones. There's no Wi-Fi, no Bluetooth, no m2 slot, no USB-C again bare-bones, but it's also less than $50 so it's kind of unfair to complain about. The foundation of this build is Intel's KabyLake i3-7100 now generally I don't recommend using the i3 line, because they're dual-core processors and they're usually crushed in multi-core performance by Intel's i5 lineup, and then the i3's usually only offer marginally better performance than the much cheaper Pentium series. Alas the i3 7100 is one of the few exceptions it's one of the better performers in i3 history, and it will be perfect in a hackintosh and for about $100 it's a pretty fair price. RAM is a complete ripoff right now. Thanks to supply shortages and alleged price fixing by suppliers in China, it just is so we're only going to use 8 gigabytes of DDR4 memory and even that, even that cost $85. Wow, so that leaves just $110 for our storage, power supply, and case... Uh-oh. Luckily we got it figured out. For the PSU, I selected a fully modular 520 watt SeaSonic bronze which I know is super overkill but it was only $34.99 with a mail-in rebate from Newegg, and that price is no longer available for this specific power supply but really great power supplies go on rebate and discount all the time and I've listed a few of those in the parts list below. Now hard drives are miserable as boot volumes-in my opinion, so I chose a 120 gigabyte Kingston SSD instead, now it's pretty small storage capacity and it's not going to win any awards but it's only $50 if you can pay a few dollars more to get a higher capacity one I would recommend it. Lastly the case, a Rosewill Ranger M this case was $17 $17! The craziest thing, is that it isn't even that crappy! The sheet metal is solid, there aren't any sharp edges that you'll cut yourself on except for maybe those break away PCIe slot brackets but even then it comes with two fans, and one of them is a futuristic look-how-hip and awesome I am-non RGB, just B blue LED. Where's the GPU you might ask? Well there isn't one, part of the reason is because GPUs are insanely expensive right now, but also because MacOS handles really well on internal Intel graphics and so I didn't feel the need to increase the price of the build in order to implement one but you really should spend an extra thirty to fifty dollars to get an older used graphics card on Craigslist or Ebay like a 750Ti if you're going to need accelerated graphics or you're going to attempt some light gaming, but it's not a break or make situation in this build, so I didn't use one. And that's it, it actually doesn't look half bad. Alright, enough gawking because it doesn't look that great time to load up MacOS. Thankfully this process is a breeze and it could even be handled without issue for first-time builder again, the instructions are below but everything works including internal graphics, Ethernet and with a little modification iMessage and the App Store so great it boots, it runs MacOS, and it looks super super d*ck. But how well does it run? Actually shockingly good! In Geekbench it shines in single core performance hanging with even the best of current gen iMacs while it actually out benches and performs every MacBook Pro, which is maybe a little unsurprising, but it absolutely plummets the current gen and the last very outdated Mac Mini, which Apple has the audacity to continue selling in 2018 for $1000. Multi-core results however is where the dual core i3 starts to show it's- well it's dual-core-ness. It shames the similarly dual-core crap- Mac Mini and nears the performance of the base model dual core i5 iMac, but it gets rekt by pretty much everything else. Does that really matter though? What's the real-world performance like? Honestly for 95% of people it's pretty excellent it can handle multitasking, 4k video playback, normal stuff like everything you would normally do on a computer just fine even surprisingly in Final Cut Pro X it works really well I was able to edit 4K Canon 5D Mark 4 footage with color adjustment layers and it experienced very minimal frame dropping, not shabby! As for actual export time though well, it's not winning any awards falling pretty far behind modern workstations again, this is a dual-core i3. But that said it's it's pretty amazing that a computer that cost the same as 150 McDouble's can fare so well. Now while this $350 machine certainly serves its purpose, it only benched a little bit better than the $70 hackintosh that I built last year. Generally speaking in this price range try to find something used because your money will go a lot further, save old tech from landfills, And it will also exercise your right to repair which is exactly why you need a Pro Tech Toolkit from iFixit- now before you click away I know the tools aren't the most exciting thing in the world, but seriously I use the Pro Tech Toolkit almost everyday, heck I even bought a second one with my own money to keep it home. The 64-bit screwdriver set has just about every crazy bit size you'll ever need including Apple's pentalobe, an Nintendo's tripoint security screws, you'll get high-quality tweezers, and some lifesaver tools to help you get into the tightest of spaces Now for $60 this kit is a steel in my opinion and with a lifetime warranty, you'd be a fool to miss out. Go to ifixit.com/snazzylabs or visit the link below to get yours. If you enjoyed this video please give it a like! If you didn't well that other button seems to work okay too. Check out our other awesome videos over here, but most importantly and as always stay snazzy. See you later folks! Okay, that's good!",

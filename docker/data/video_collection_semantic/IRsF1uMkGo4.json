    "transcript": "it's time it's time to finally take a look at the most hyped up gaming laptop that you guys have any requesting us to take a look at that's none other than the Acer Predator Helios 300 you see everyone's been talking about this laptop every time we post a notebook review and when I exfol through the comments Helios 300 Helios 300 you guys should definitely check it out it's finally here and what's even cool is that I can now compare it to some welts or about similarly priced notebooks and kind of check out what the performance is like and how well it actually cools a hardware now speaking of hardware that's one of the main selling factors of the Helios 300 because what are we talking about in terms of specs well it's got an i7 9750 h6 core to alternate processor 16 gigabytes of RAM in dual channel mode a 256 gigabyte nvme SSD a gtx 60 and 60 TI non-mexican graphics card and a 1080p IPS 144 hertz display all of which will cost you $1,200 that is a deal that that's just an insane deal in fact you can actually pick it up for a little less on Amazon right now I'll make sure to leave links in the description down below just in case if you're interested in picking one up so is the predator Helios 300 be best bang for the buck gaming laptop that you can buy right now let's find out but first a quick message from our sponsor the new cooler master master mouse 710 a weird name but damn this thing is good with an ultra lightweight body at only 53 grams for excellent flick control and aim correction the ultra weave cable is awesome for Wireless like feel the ambidextrous shaped for me personally is super comfortable and I like the shorter body plus the glide is smooth thanks to white PTFE feet enjoy the domination with an excellent optical sensor and despite the funky name the cooler master mm710 is legit check it out the low alright so first things first the design and there's nothing really special going on over here at first lines anyone would just classify this as a gaming laptop just because of the way how it looks if you're looking for something a little bit more real or profile and stealth this just wouldn't fit that criteria because you've got the predator logo at the front that's LED lit in teal which is really cool and refreshing to see compared to these two black and red color schemes that we're seeing on a lot of notebooks these days honestly I feel like red and black is just too overrated at this point you've also got a few other teal accents throughout the body including the trackpad the wast and arrow keys have a bit of teal accent as well so does the back lining it's nice and consistent I think Dave 2d will certainly improve the chassis is mostly made out of hard plastic materials but it's put together really well there's barely any flex on the keyboard and the screen which is really good the hinge is nice and sturdy there's no wobble whatsoever seriously this laptop for the price it just blew me away I mean it does better than some really expensive laptops out there you know you're good by looking at you right now the webcam is located exactly where I need it to be I mean while this notebook doesn't have these slimmest bezels compared to the competition I actually don't mind having a little bit of bezel even at the top and the bottom because just it just from a function knowledge standpoint it does a job really well opening of the notebook you're greeted with a full-size keyboard and the keys are excellent they don't feel mushy but rather they sport a good amount of travel distance honestly this is one of the best out there even up against the legion laptops from lenovo the trackpad isn't the best that i've tried so far it's partly because it is a plastic surface and not a glass trackpad that you'd find in a lot more expensive premium gaming laptops however the good thing is that they do eventually smoothen out with the help of your pay increase which is a little bit gross but it works out eventually and they do support Windows position drivers so windows gestures work flawlessly on the Helios 300 the speakers are well as we expected located at the bottom which means do not expect the best sound quality coming out of this laptop there's just no bass and there's just no body to the sound when you're listening to music or watching videos so I'd highly recommend pairing it with a good set of headphones for a good comfortable content consuming experience port selection is really good so on the left hand side you have Kensington lock power an rj45 2 USB 3.1 gen2 ports that's right gen 2 so you can take advantage of the 10 gigabits per second protocol you also get a headphone / mic jack switching over to the right there's an HDMI port mini DisplayPort and extra USB 3.1 type a and type C ports unfortunately type C isn't Thunderbolt 3 moving on to the display it's a 1080p 144 Hertz IPS panel and honestly it was a fantastic experience gaming on it I really enjoyed my time and I think I said this in the past if you're looking for a gaming laptop in 2019 just go for a panel with a fast refresh rate if it has IPs that's even better because the colors in the contrary she was really good on this display my only gripe is that it doesn't get bright outdoors so out of your visibility is just a little bit challenging and also on my sample I noticed a little bit of clouding at the top when I did my black screen test so if you're watching movies especially with that crop during low-light scenarios that could be a little distracting upgrade ability is very straight forward on the Helios 300 so you have instant access to the memory and storage I'm actually really surprised by these storage expansion options you get with this laptop so there's an MT m2 slot that can be populated with an nvme SSD which is nice the 256 gigabyte primary nvme SSD is from hynek's and it doesn't have the fastest to read or write speeds so keep that in mind and on top of all of this expansion Acer has implemented a two-and-a-half-inch dry salon and they do provide a hard drive installation kit within the box so you can really load this notebook up with some high capacity drives this laptop has a 50 cent one hour battery and unfortunately it's not the greatest especially when compared to the rise in notebook from Asus that we checked out recently the G a 502 D U as well as the lenovo Elysian Wi-Fi 45 so if you're planning on lugging this thing around to school or whatnot you're really not gonna be impressed with a battery life honestly this could have been addressed a vase or offered a different SKU where they didn't have that to a half inch hard drive bracket but then equipped it with a larger battery because honestly 2 m dot 2 slots that's good enough and SSDs especially nvme SSDs are getting cheaper as well and you can pick them up for a really good deal moving on to performance the core i7 97 50 H performs extremely well as you can see compared to these similarly priced Zephyrs rise in notebook that I looked at a while back the Helios just destroys it even comparing it to the Legion Wi-Fi 45 featuring the same i7 CPU the takes the edge by a little bit because it's cooling solution and the ability to sustain those higher clock speeds is just remarkable and I'll get to that in just a bit taking a look at our standard 13 minute Premiere Pro render test we took a 4k video exported it to the YouTube h.264 preset and the system took 10 minutes and 43 seconds to complete that task which is of course things to Intel Quick Sync so this is a fantastic option if you plan on creating content and since this is a gaming laptop it does that job really really well as you can see you can comfortably play at 1080p set to the highest settings above 100 frames per second in most titles and when you pair that with the 144 Hertz refresh rate display this thing is an all-rounder in terms of CPU clock speeds during idle I was easily able to notice clock speeds above 4 gigahertz and during load during my render test the CPU was comfortably able to sustain those speeds around 4 gigahertz but what really surprised me where those temperatures you see it does speak a bit over 90 but on average it was around 76 to 77 degrees Celsius but with the help of this magical button called turbo which I accidentally mistake and as the power button it dramatically reduces those temperatures but the catch is as I'm going to show it to you live right now I'm gonna hit that turbo button right over there and you know can you even hear me let's just turn it off so through that live demonstration you probably just heard how loud a fans get when you enable turbo mode which does do the trick it does bring those temperatures down but realistically you don't have to enable it because the laptop does a really good job cooling the CPU in the first place unless if you decide to run I don't know prime95 for like 24 hours but I mean come on that's just not realistic now fan noise in general by itself is really good even during low situations it doesn't get extremely loud especially compared to those thin and light gaming laptops so we're seeing lately the gtx 660ti ran really cool as well as I was monitoring temps I only noticed it peak at 72 C which is really amazing and the clock speeds were between 1680 and 1710 megahertz so to conclude I am really impressed with the patter to Helios 300 but that was I'm surprised because I was expecting that considering that this laptop has been and currently is really popular among a lot of gamers you see for 1200 dollars this is the best bang for the buck gaming laptop that you can buy right now because the performance is amazing you can do all sorts of stuff with it not just gaming but if you want to create content on it or if you want to do a little bit of streaming on it the hardware by itself is a fantastic combo because the 60 SEC Ti is a non max-q variant so that means you're gonna get the best gaming performance at 1080p the core i7 9250 H is a great CPU for editing videos and photos so if you want to get a little bit creative as well this is a great option not to mention it actually cools the hardware really well compared to the Legion Wi-Fi 45 from Lenovo that's priced a little bit more compared to the Helios 300 but it features the same specs so that's a bonus and these storage expansion options are also fantastic on the Helios 300 but that being said I know that some of you may not be really into the way how this laptop looks perhaps you guys would have preferred a more stealth low profile looking laptop and I hope Acer would bring up something like that in the future the trap that isn't the greatest as well as the speakers they don't sound that great and the battery life is pretty terrible so I would highly recommend lugging around your AC adapter which isn't that heavy at all so that is a little bit of a downside and I do want to mention this really quickly the killer 1500 Wi-Fi card that's on this notebook is technically from Intel it's just running killer software you know I did experience a few dropdowns a couple of times and then after a restart everything seems to be working just fine so I thought that that was worth bringing up but if you're willing to dodge those bullets the predator Helios 300 for Acer is the best gaming laptop that money can buy right now in fact I want to know your thoughts about this laptop do you think there are any of the alternatives that might give this notebook a run for its money now 1200 ollars is still pretty expensive perhaps there is a sub $1000 notebook that you might want us to check out definitely let us know the comments down below I will keep an eye out for this laptop for Black Friday or special sales events because it does sell it really fast so yeah that's pretty much it thank you so much for watching make sure to check out some relevant content over here subscribe and hit that note Bell so that he don't miss out on a new video that we publish I need one with hundred connects thank you so much for watching and I'll talk to you guys in the next one",

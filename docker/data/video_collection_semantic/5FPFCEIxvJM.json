    "transcript": "So you can hear I'm still a little bit under the weather still. got a bit of a sore throat, kept me ... out of the videos for a little bit and what did that mean well it meant, that I had to put Ryan in this seat and you guys saw that video and you gave him a lot of thumbs up his head had began to inflate like a hot air balloon hey Lew, look, a 150,000 thumbs up Guess who's the new host of Unbox Therapy. and I said \"REALLY?!\" what do you guys think, are you ready for a new host? or do you wanna kick it with your old man Lew? well I'll tell you how to let me know! we gotta smash that like button! we gotta destroy his figure! if we don't beat 150,000 likes I'm going to have to go into retirement like Michael Jordan Did you hear that Jack? It's not often that I ask you guys for your help but I'm afraid right now very afraid Alright, what are we talking about today? I'm going to show you how to add wireless charging to your iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus Now the thing that I missed switching back To iOS was the opportunity to wireless charge at this point I've got wireless chargers all over the place beside my bed, in my car so to not be able to interact with them and be fiddling with cables was not the ideal scenario. So, I went on Amazon and I started looking around and I realized there's no truly official solution for adding wireless charging to your iPhone 7/7 Plus at this point in time So I'm going to show you how to do it, McGuyver style Over here I have these \"Chi\" receivers This one over here is from Speigen this is from IQI mobile This is the one that I recently purchased I'm going to have these things linked down below so this will sit on the back and then this guy fits in there like that ....(now)..... your thinking damn dude that looks pretty ugly the idea after doing this is stick your devise into a case so i do have case options over hear now not every case will work and some cases will work better then others when i ordered up this charge pad right here it also came with this wireless charger a Qi wireless charges on this side over here it not gonna be for everybody ok for me once I started doing I was like man there's just something about sticking cables in thats just bothering me these days so I'm addicted you might become addicted yourself that's my little speel speel shpeel if you hope to use wired headphones this might be a hassle to pull this in and out but of course apple wants you to wireless anyways this shouldn't be much of an issue so snap it in and there you go the thing about this case it's too thick the wireless transmission won't happen through it so that's where I had to get crafty and start trying some different cases some cases like this UAG one not gonna be great for your contact point so the two that I found that work well are these ones from Spigen essentially the thinner the case the better this ones a little bit softer and this is a slightly harder shell but there both super thin just have this plugged in like that pretty simple and then you just take your device and drop it on maybe you don't Jack new discovery this little charger right here not quite as effective as the one I have in my car I have a Samsung one and what I noticed is that this hard case that I just spoke about Is actually not transmitting nearly as well as the soft one If you want maximum compatibility I'm gonna go ahead and fully recommend this case now When I drop it on there Boom So with this kind of setup you do need to be more aware of where you place it so my recommendation is don't mess around go with this exact setup if this is something you feel like you need to have Also remember we got to crush Ryan's number we'll crush his dreams at the same time We got to beat it in this video right here or else I'm retiring I'll go play baseball Like M.J. you guys don't believe me",

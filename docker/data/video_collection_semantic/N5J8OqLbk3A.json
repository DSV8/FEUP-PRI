    "transcript": "- Yo guys, Jonathan here, the Galaxy S10 is official, and yesterday I got a chance to hang out with one, or four, because there are four Galaxy S10s. (upbeat music) We have the Galaxy S10E, the Galaxy S10, the Galaxy S10+, and the Galaxy S10 5G. So the Galaxy S10E is Samsung's budget approach and clearly an answer to the iPhone 10 R and really the biggest difference across the four is going to be the screen size. The Galaxy S10 E comes in at 5.8 inches, the Galaxy S10 at 6.1, the Galaxy S10 Plus at 6.4 and finally the big mamma jamma, the Galaxy S5G which comes in at 6.7 inches. Now before I dive any deeper I kinda wanna throw the Galaxy S10 5G outta the mix because one, it doesn't come out until later this year and I think for most people you should probably skip on this one. So beyond the display the other differences between these four phones is one, the battery, the bigger the phone the bigger the battery capacity and on top of that you have the cameras. The Galaxy S10 E features a dual camera while the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10 Plus feature a triple-decker camera and finally we have the Galaxy S10 5G which features four cameras but is worth noting that that fourth camera is really only used for depth. Now the big question is does that hole in the display get in the way and honestly it was a pretty limited time with the device, most the time it was just kinda seeing these cool faces. (upbeat music) I will say the Galaxy S10 no matter which device you look at is a really beautiful device and that hole really didn't bother me as much as I thought that it would. The one area were I say that it might actually be a little bit of a distraction is when you're web browsing or have something just blatantly whites or lights or it's a super big contrast between the two but I definitely want to spend some more time with it before I give my full assessment. Outside of that though the display itself looks really good, it's HTR 10 Plus certified, it's what Samsung is calling dynamic AMOLED and all that fancy tech talk aside Samsung makes awesome displays and this is no different. Outside of that the other big change to the Galaxy S10 is bye bye to the rear finger print scanner and hello to the in display finger print reader which Samsung is calling the ultrasonic fingerprint scanner 5000 minus the 5000, I'm sorry Samsung it's a really long name. Long ass name aside, my initial impressions with this is one, it works smooth, it worked well and two it's gotta real pretty animation. We did this come to the OnePlus 6T where I felt that animation was a little too PC master race, sorry Linus but yeah the animation on the Galaxy S10 is really good looking. The Galaxy S10 also features a cool trick up it's sleeve called Wireless PowerShare which allows you to charge devices wirelessly on the phone itself and yes Huawei boys, I realize Samsung didn't invent it, they weren't the first but we just for a second appreciate cool technology. Other small details is that headphone jack is still there so props to Samsung for really holding their ground on that in the world and the era where everyone's saying peace to the headphone jack, Samsung is playing it cool and keeping that there so I gotta respect that. Now the lineup as a whole I think can be a little confusing, not only are their four Galaxy S10's, there are a ton of variants, the good news is the base storage on these comes at 128 gigabytes or you can max this out all the way up to one terabyte and then expand that an additional 512 with a micro SD card which is crazy. Beyond that there's a special ceramic edition, they come in a ton of pretty pretty colors which my favorite has gotta be - [Rick Grimes] Carl. - Those details will differ depending on your location so we'll drop those specifics down below along with the first look at a really really cool 16 inch MacBook Pro concept. Thank you guys for watching, hopefully you enjoyed the video, if you did and you are feeling like being awesome make sure you guys go, Austin Evans and everyone else featured in this video on that like button, this is Johnathan and I'll catch you guys later.

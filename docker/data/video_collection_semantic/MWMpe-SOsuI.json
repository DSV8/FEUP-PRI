    "transcript": "- My unlimited budget wifi setup has some problems. The only one I've talked about so far, is the weird interference on the wireless speakers, in the family room. But I'm also getting disconnections on Apple devices when I'm moving around my house, and my phone takes forever to connect to the outdoor access points when I pull into my driveway. Which wouldn't be a huge problem, except that I have no cell service in my neighborhood, so I can't open my garage. I mean, don't get me wrong. When it works, the speeds are really solid. But in spite of that, it's like there's this voice in the back of my head, you know? Wifi 6e. Wifi 6e. Wifi 6e. It almost sounds like Jake. Wait. - Whoa. - I knew it! I knew it! - Okay, but hear me out. Ubiquity's wifi 6e might not be technically enabled in Canada yet, but there's a hacky workaround, and the speeds are absolutely ridiculous. - I've had issues with Ubiquity wifi gear in the past, though, which is why I went Ruckus in the first place. But I will give them one more chance. I mean, given that it works great everywhere else in my life, including at the office, it should be fine. And if it's not, Jake has promised me that he will personally reinstall all of my existing Ruckus access points. Just like I'm going to install this segway, to our sponsor. - It's FreshBooks. Thanks FreshBooks for sponsoring this video. FreshBooks simplifies accounting and bookkeeping, ensuring you're ready for tax time. Right now, there's a special offer just for our viewers, so head to freshbooks.com/techtips to save 90% off your first four months, today. - There's probably a way to fix some of the issues that I've run into so far. Ruckus Unleashed might not be as feature rich as their Dedicated or their Cloud Controllers, but it does have most of the basics. It's just that the basics haven't helped me fix my issues so far, and besides, they won't upgrade my wifi 6 access points to wifi 6e anyway, which is a lot of the point of what we're doing. - I wonder if part of the problem is these access points are just so overkill. I was looking in Unleashed in my phone and laptop. We're grabbing the AP upstairs. And we're... there's one right there. - Yeah. - What's going on? - Literally right above us. I even turned the power down to minimum as a troubleshooting step, recently. - And it was still happening. - Well, it's still happening right now. - Yeah, yeah. - Because it's turned down right now. - Yeah. - Well, let's have a look at what we got here. I actually haven't seen any of this. Jake surprised me. Actually, everyone surprised me. I didn't even know we were doing this video. I was at Disneyland. - Well, for inside wifi 6e, this is the Unified 6 Enterprise. Each one of these APs can handle, I think it's 600+ clients. - Oh my God. - Something like 10 Gigabit of throughput, theoretically. - This is, sorry, 10 Gigabit of throughput? - Well like, connectivity between all the clients. - Good gravy. We've got a total of then, five of these for the inside. One for the garage. That's six because we learned absolutely nothing about how having too many access points can actually be problematic. - Oh, just turn it off. - The wifi 6e could actually help us with that. We'll talk a little bit more about that later. And then I have two outside, which doesn't explain why you have four. - Well, I wasn't really sure what would be the best option. These ones kind of look nice. You see it's just like a little tube, and you can just mount it under the soffit. These ones aren't wifi 6e, but since it's outdoors anyways, you know 6 GHz is not really ideal, nor needed. You just need to open your garage, right? - Yeah. - We're probably gonna go with the long range plus, because it's really long range. It's got a very powerful 2.4 gig antenna. I didn't even ask if we can show this one, 'cause it's technically EA, but I'm sure it's fine. - Ha ha. Got 'em. - These are wifi 6 on both 2.4 and 5. The cool thing about these ones is they're sealed. Like, you could put this in a bucket of water. - Before we go any further, we should probably explain why wifi 6e is so important. This is not just a little speed bump. It's more about the fact that we're getting access to an enormous uninterrupted 1200 MHz of spectrum, that up until now, hasn't been used for any wifi communications. It's in the 6 GHz range, and it's a whopping, what is it, like 7? - 1200 MHz, 7 160 wide channels. - Oh! - The problem with 5 GHz wifi, there's all those like, little sections that are blocked off, so you can't have big channels. And then there's like the radar thing. It's... - And the width of the channel is what gives you the speed. - Yeah. - Plus, since this spectrum is completely empty, with none of my neighbors realistically using it, I could have every single one of my APs on a completely separate 160 MHz wide bend, so they don't interfere with each other at all. - Plus, because it's higher in the frequency range, it's faster. And when I say faster, you can do 1 and a half gigabit both ways to a single client, if it's supported. If you're wondering why I'm wearing gloves, so I don't get like, schmear on the ceiling, you know, finger goo. Ceiling paint is very not glossy, and it is really hard to clean. Unfortunately, the mounting holes are not the same. Maybe they are? Does those look the same? E and E? Oh my God, they are. All right, there we go. Now we just need to adopt the AP. It popped up here already. It's gonna have to update, and then we should start receiving wifi from it. Now we just have to repeat this process seven more times. Two of which are outdoors, and it's raining. - I can shoot from inside. - Oh, these drywall anchors are crap. They like, painted over them so they're stuck in. Ugh! Most drywall anchors, when you run the screw into the anchor, kind of like break apart in the back, to hold it in place, and prevent that from happening. I think what happened is they used screws that are too short, so it's not broken open in the back, and it can just screw right out like we're saying. Easy. I will say the Ruckus ones, huge pain in the ass. I mean, just look at it. You have two little keyholes that you have to get the keys perfectly lined up on for both, and then it slides on. But when you can't see, and you're trying to get the stupid screws to line up, it's kind of a pain in the ass. You can even see all the scratches, from when we tried to mount these things. This AP is gonna suck to change. - Can I help you boys? This is terribly awkward. - Why? It's really not heavy at all. - Oh my gosh. There's a dead spider. Ew, it's not dead. Go away. - You're doing such a great job, Linus. Keep it up. - And I helped. (tool sanding) - Oh yeah. Woo! For those wondering, this is not an ideal place to position an access point. Usually you want them in the center of the ceiling, of the space that you're trying to fill, or the center of the wall, if the ceiling's not available. This particular wire is supposed to poke through in the wall, but I guess they didn't read the plans right, and put it in the ceiling instead. So, uh, yeah, it lives in the corner of the wall now. Oh. Ah! - Hey, nice! - Damn it, they're deck screws. Fortunately, everyone chirps the LTT screwdriver for this. It has Robertson, so I can actually take these out. It's quite the size difference, eh? I like this. It's got a little bit different design for where the cable plugs in. Usually they plug in here, and it's really hard to get it in, but they did it at an angle with a little bit bigger hole, so it's much easier to plug in. Oh, I got it. I don't actually, it's not even showing up in here. What is wrong with your app? - I don't know. It's possible that I'm just not signed up for early access. Access. - Yeah... - Basically, what Jake's trying to do is he's trying to enable access to beta firmwares for devices, because those early access outdoor APs, you can't just run production firmware on them, obviously, because they're not even production devices. But we don't have the console... - Mine does. Maybe it's just the difference between the iOS and Android app. I think we still need to do it on computer. - Really? - Yeah. I need this to say like, it should say release candidate, and then early access, and early access is what we want, but it is not working. In the meantime, I think I'm just gonna mount the AP and he can adopt it in a few hours, when this recognizes the change. Okay. All eight of our access points are hung up now. So the first thing we need to do is create a wifi network for wifi 6e, because it's a separate band. I guess you could technically have one that is 2.45 and 6, all with the same name. But then you're not really gonna know which network you're connected to. We're gonna name it wifi 6e for now. Password 12345678, and then go to Manual. Turn off 2.4 gig and 5 and just select 6GHz. This is gonna require us to use WPA3, which is the new security protocol for wifi 6e. It's very similar to WPA2, but with stronger encryption. So that's the best option. Just add our wifi network. Boom. We'll give that a few seconds, and we should be able to see it on this laptop here, which is wifi 6e enabled. It does support 160 MHz wide channels, but only in a 2 by 2 stream. We might not be able to get above gigabit on this one, but we should be able to get really good speeds, and we can connect to the 5 GHZ network to compare the two, and see the speed difference. 'Cause it should still be substantial. I went to just double check to make sure that the wifi 6e is working, and it says the 6 GHZ radio is disabled. Because we're in Canada, there's some weird certification stuff that's going on with wifi 6e, despite it being approved, just like the States. So to get around it, we go into our unified control center here, and change our country from Canada to the United States. Probably not super legal, but we're doing it anyways. Now that we've switched over, I wanna try the speakers. This isn't gonna be a definitive test, because the problem that he was having is kind of intermittent anyways, but... (upbeat music) - Yeah, something's... screwy. Oh yeah, nevermind. It's still screwy. We probably need to go tweak the channels, and maybe shut 5 GHz off on the AP that's right above here. But I wasn't super confident this was gonna fix this problem anyways. Ah, look at that. There's our wifi 6e network. We're in business. Speed test. Okay, let's go stand under this AP. 300 down is not bad, not incredible either, to be honest. The peak we saw there was 850 Mbps upload. That's pretty fast. 326, 780. I didn't tweak anything. Everything's set to automatic. Okay, let's walk around with my phone really quick. Before I would walk between one room, and it would completely disconnect, and it's not like it would, you know, be disconnected for a little bit. It would stay disconnected, until I manually went in and reconnected to the network. - I wanna see it on mine too, 'cause I know about how fast it should be on mine. - This is a Fold 3, right? - Yeah. - So you should have 6e. Do you see a wifi network called wifi 6e? - You really called it wifi 6e? - Well just for now. - Jake... - There it is. - 6e, yeah. - Sick! It's 12345678. - Oh, it's a good thing we have WPA3. Okay, go! That's only 300. - Just wait till it goes to the upload. - Well, why is download slow? - I'm not a hundred percent sure. Even on 5 gig it's kind of slow. - Why am I cursed? I was getting like 600+ before. You just downgraded my wifi. - No, no, it's great. Trust me. - What do you mean, great? That's not great. 150 mega... - That's speed... - Jake, you goofed. - No, it's fast. Don't worry. - No, you goofed. - No, it's great. Look, when I walk around your house it doesn't disconnect anymore. - Okay, well that's an improvement. - So Jake, you basically downgraded Linus' network just so your iPhone wouldn't disconnect when you walk around the house? - This wasn't about me at all then was it? You know what it was about? (beep) - Well it looks like we found the problem. There were a couple of issues. One, is that we didn't have flow control enabled on the switch. That got us to 800... 900 megabit a second, with the old switch. But here's the thing. My old POE switch was gigabit, which is actually a bottleneck, even for a single client. So we've actually swapped out the switch, to their new Enterprise 48 port, that has 48 ports of two and a half gig, and then four 10 gigabit SFP pluses. It should then be ripping fast. All I gotta do is set up a network that uses 6 GHz, and I'll... Maybe I'll also have to get a little closer to an access point? 700... (voice rising) Let it rip! 900! Whoa, more than a gigabit up. There she goes. Jake has these same APs at home, has actually seen speeds in excess of 1.5 gigabit. As cool as all this is though, so far I'm finding a bit of a challenge to actually take advantage of 6GHz wifi. The issue with that is that iOS devices and modern Android phones no longer allow you to set an order of priority for your wireless networks. There are third party apps that do it, but not natively as far as I'm aware. So, ridiculously, what my phone does is it just grabs my 5 GHz wifi network literally all the time. Then, what I tried next was to just enable 6 GHz on my 5 GHz network, and it's 6. Not 6e. It's right there. How much closer can I be? But as I'm driving up the street to my house, can I connect and operate my garage door? Action lead! And we did it. Oh wait, did I hit the sensor? Darn it. (tape rewinding) So this wasn't about me at all then was it? You know what it was about? Our sponsor. - Best Buy. And today's featured product: the Logitech StreamCam Plus.

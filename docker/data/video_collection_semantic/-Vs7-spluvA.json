    "description": "Bonafide Hardware REAL Glass Galaxy S7 lens:  Antistatic Tweezers (Any tweezers will work fine):   Let me know if the links stops working!!  Breaking the Glass camera lens on your Galaxy S7 is just part of life. It protrudes a little out of the back of the phone... and well... it breaks.  Luckily the replacement parts are not very expensive, and relatively easy to replace. As long as you DO NOT get glass dust inside of the camera unit. Once you get dust in there it will stop focusing. That dust might fall out at some point... but You dont want to risk damaging your camera.  (If the camera does stop focusing, and does not recover on its own, it can be professionally replaced. OR you can try fixing it yourself with a part like this:   Like always, if you have any questions leave them in the comments. and i would love it if you could subscribe! Thank you!

    "transcript": "Today I have in front of me a very well taken care of Galaxy S7. The worst part about it is that the camera lens is cracked, so you cant take pictures. The rest of the phone works fine, but with a cracked camera lens youre missing one of the most important features of the phone. Today Im going to show you how to replace the camera glass with a new lens so that you can take clear pictures again. The hardest part of this project is making sure that no glass dust gets inside the camera unit. And Ill show you why in just one second. It is really hard to find quality glass lenses. Most replacements youll find online will be clear plastic that you can bend or fold, but taking a picture through plastic isnt near as good as taking a picture through glass. I use Bonafide Hardware glass lenses because they are actually glass. I got two so that I could show you that the glass is real. This lens fits the Galaxy S7 and the Galaxy S7 Edge; both of them are the same size. I will link the Bonafide Hardware lenses in the video description of this video. Youll need a heat gun for this project. This is important because you want to soften the adhesive under the broken glass so that it doesnt shatter more as you remove it. The more your old lens shatters, the more you risk getting glass into the camera mechanism and killing your focus abilities and your OIS, the stabilization. Im also going to use a clear piece of tape. Im going to take my heat gun, or you can use your sisters hair dryer, and heat up the glass of the camera lens until its too hot to touch. Then I will quickly put tape over the cracked lens and try to pull off any loose bits of glass that I can find. If you end up with a hole in your lens this project becomes a lot easier. I got one little piece of glass off but that will be enough to start. Now that the glass is cooled down I need to reheat it to soften the adhesive again. Then, holding the phone sideways so no glass falls inside the camera unit, I can lift off each piece of glass individually. The warmer the adhesive is the easier it will be to do this. You can warm up the phone as often as you need, just make sure not to overheat it and damage the camera. Only go until it is barely too hot to touch. As you can see the lens is mechanical, so it has moving parts. If the glass dust gets inside of the camera, it will stop working. The OIS will stop, and worse, the focusing will stop. Sometimes it will start focusing again after a couple days when the glass drops out, but its better to avoid that all together and just be careful. So now Im going to clean up the extra adhesive and the glass bits inside of the frame. If there are any glass bits still in there when I press my new lens into place, the new lens will crack because of that pressure point. So make sure all the glass dust is off. If there are gaps in the adhesive from the news lens that you put on, then regular dust from your pocket might seep into your camera lens over time. So make sure its as clean as possible and dont get anything on the unprotected camera unit. Clean off both sides of the new glass lens, making sure there are no smudges on the underside since you wont have access to it once the new glass is in place. Remember that you are working with glass, so if you arent super confident you might just want to buy two lenses in case you break one. You shouldnt leave your camera unprotected for very long. Make sure that the adhesive is still on the glass side of the lens after removing the adhesive protection. Then drop your new lens into place and line it up inside of the frame. Remember if you press too hard you might crack the new glass, so be gentle. As you can see I did retain all of my focusing abilities with this Galaxy S7. Being super careful with the glass does pay off. Thanks a ton for watching. I did link all of the parts and tools youll need for this project down in the video description below. If you have any questions leave them in the comments. I do respond fairly regularly. And all of my behind the scenes stuff can be found on my Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat. Thanks a ton for watching. Hope to see you around.",

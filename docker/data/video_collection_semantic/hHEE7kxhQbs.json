    "transcript": "so far the AMD based notebooks that we've taken a look at have been geared towards specific purposes it all started with the ROG g14 which was geared towards folks who are willing to pay a little bit more for a compact form factor that can pull double duty for both greater focus tasks rendering tasks as well as gaming as well then there was the TUF A15 which was a slightly larger laptop but it was loads more affordable and it came with a Ryzen sound 4800 H and in RTX 2060 feel like those were a really good balance of GPU and CPU horsepower and then there's this the msi bravo 15 i'm not really sure who this is targeted towards because on one hand it can be the highest performing budget notebook that i've ever seen but at the same time it struggles in some key areas msi says that it's a gaming laptop but it sort of isn't at the same time this one was a really tough laptop to evaluate guys so let's take a deep dive and see where this stands in the current notebook market after this the razer viper ultimate the lightest and fastest wireless mouse designed for esports with an accurate focus plus 20k dpi optical sensor raise your hyper speed wireless technology that is 25% faster than the competition all packed onto lightweight body with optical mouse switches check it out below alright so I'm gonna start with pricing which is really good actually for the whole series starting at 929 you get a Ryzen 5 4600H 8 gigs of ram 5 tall gig SSD and an RX5500M with eight hundred twenty Hertz display adding $70 to that brings you to our sample featuring the 8 core 16 thread 4800H twice the memory but it still sticks to that rx 5500 M the thousand dollar gaming notebook category is super competitive these days we expect at least a gtx 660ti level graphics at that price even with AMD cpus there's an rx5600M in the g515 SE which you know will hit a grand in Dulce frequent sales while asus is offering gtx 660ti in their thousand-dollar A15 let's start with exterior impressions and I'm just going to say it's pretty decent for the price don't expect an aluminum construction it's mostly a plastic chassis with brush textures on the lid which I don't like because two or three months down the road that's not gonna look like the day you unboxed it the hinge is pretty strong in fact if my memory serves me well this feels stronger than the TUF A15 I didn't experience any wobble I mean this thing is it's pretty amazing for the price I gotta give it to him aside for that the interior space is pretty low profile which I like but I really wished if they went with a sandstone finish and just can't vouch for how long this brush texture would last with skin oil or other things that make contact with it so that's something to look out for the keyboard layout is pretty standard weirdly a lot of the function keys up top don't have any secondary functions they're just blank I mean it would have been nice to see all the media playback buttons or controls mapped to those function keys but that could just be me the keys themselves are good the child distance is short but to my surprise I got use of them really quickly personally I prefer them over the TUF A15 and if you type a lot or game a lot these will do the job just fine it is backlit with red LEDs unfortunately there is no RGB lighting so you can't tweet the colors brightness levels are okay I have nothing to complain here however my biggest frustration with this notebook is the trackpad it is a plastic smooth finish which is okay and has support for Windows precision drivers but it isn't secured properly and what do I mean by that well if you're clicking on something you'd either tap or press the primary left or right buttons but in this case tap works okay but if you press it doesn't actually register you'd have to like press it even harder to get something to work it's almost like a two-step process I feel like something is or the track by itself is sort of loose and that to me was pretty annoying and frustrating I think you guys have to listen to this to actually get a feel of what I'm talking about so this is the webcam test on the Bravo 15 now the video quality is okay I mean we can't really expect anything greater at this point the microphone is decent there is a bit of compression with my voice but ironically it sounds way better than the GS 66 stealth that checked out recently which costs you know twenty five hundred dollars it's significantly more expensive than this laptop they plays the microphone where it's supposed to be you don't hear any fans which is great so there should be fine for casual Skype or zoo meetings the speakers are bottom facing it's a classic move by MSI so don't expect them to blow your mind away in fact for the same price point I feel like the TUF A15 has a better speaker system than this one because it suits some really interesting design tweaks within the chassis to enrich the sound signature now moving on to ports most of them are located on the right hand side which I'm sure is gonna be a problem when you use an external Mouse now supposedly MSI did this to make sure that the hot air exhausts from the left hand side which is away from your typical you know external mouse position but if you're a left-hand user that would be a bit of an issue so there's that on the right hand side you get a Kensington lock LAN port two USB 3.1 genuine type-c ports which is very surprising for a thousand-dollar laptop another two USB Taipei's and an audio jack switching over to the left you get power in an HDMI do note that all USB ports are genuine foggy bits per second so it's not the fastest out there I think this is gonna be a regular occurrence on lower end AMD notebooks the display is fifteen point six inches it's 1080p IPS level with a refresh rate of 120 Hertz unfortunately MSI's IPS level marketing is not really accurate because this is bad like really bad as you can see it only covers 61 percent srgb 45 percent Adobe are and 45% tcpip 3 so if you value color accuracy don't even think about getting this the screen doesn't get brighter at the max that it can achieve is around 219 its which is pretty poor for outdoor visibility and finally there's that 120 Hertz refresh rate it's pretty awesome for gaming you can certainly get away with it if you're coming from a 60 Hertz display it's a welcoming upgrade in terms of upgrade ability you have quick access to the two RAM modules maximum support capacity is 64 gigabytes the primary nvme SSD is right over here and there's an additional MDOT two slot for expansion which is pretty cool i really like this layout it looks organized in my opinion the drive speeds are good but they're not crazy fast especially when you're compared to the A15 or even the more expensive notebooks like the blade 15 or the GS66 stealth from MSI the battery capacity is 51 watt hours but to our surprise when we ran our light low test it lasted longer than our GS 66 stealth which has almost twice the capacity in an r/t x27 a supermax cue switching gears to our heavy load tests and well that smaller capacity does come at a disadvantage with it only lasting for about an hour moving on to performance starting with Cinebench and right away it looks like something really interesting is going on even though the bravo 15 technically has the same Ryzen 7 4800H and 16 gigabytes of ram just like the A15 it's losing by a pretty significant amount in the multi-core tests while single core seems pretty much identical let's dive a bit deeper to see what's going on now remember that just like every other notebook we test them in the highest performance modes and so for the Bravo 15 is the highest performance setting that can be enabled through the Dragon Center starting with an all core load of Autodesk Maya it looks like MSI's extreme performance mode fluctuates clock speeds in an effort to hit predefined temperature targets that results in temperature shooting right up to 95 c1 the frequency is all over the place from 3.3 v all the way up to 3.5 gigahertz during this time the CPU package power was around 50 watts which is close to the top of AMD's 54 watts back then around these seven and a half minute mark CP power cuts to 45 watts which both frequencies and temperatures diving down a bit further you can see that there's about a 200 megahertz difference between balance and the extreme performance mode on the Bravo 15 but that's quickly cut to about a hundred megahertz later in the test but how does this compare to the ASUS TUF a15 well on that notebook both turbo mode and balanced start much much higher and then balance mode takes a nosedive pretty early and events out to a lower speed than MSI turbo mode continues on a bit further and then eventually levels out to a high level than the Bravo so what this tells us is that their highest performance modes like we test or in shorter bursts in balance power mode the A15 will beat the Bravo in sepia focus tests however if the test is longer the MSI in balanced mode will probably have the edge I'll be going over the expected temperatures and behaviors of these AMD CPUs in in other videos so definitely stay tuned for that but for now let's finish off the rest of the real-world benchmarks in blender you can see that the Bravo 15 being edged out again which is completely in line with our expectations in Premiere which uses AMD's discrete card for acceleration it's pretty obvious that the 5500 M causes a pretty big performance penalty in rendering versus something like an RTX 2060 even when it's paired with a super-fast cpu DaVinci Resolve shows this too but make no mistake about it either the 4800H really helps things out here handbrake meanwhile is a super CPU intensive test so the Bravo 15 gets pretty good results honestly it's amazing to see a thousand-dollar notebook with a 4800H overcoming a $2,500 windows-based machine like the Aero 17 X WinRAR isn't anything surprising either since the SSD on this isn't the fastest before getting into gaming benchmarks let's first see how the Bravo 15 behaves when both the CPU and GPU are under load in doom eternal as temperatures increase the CPU frequencies are all over the place with a variance of 1 gigahertz even as it hits just above 90 degrees meanwhile the CPU package power has between 35 and 38 watts what's probably happening here is a meze boost algorithms are simply trying to maximize clock speeds in a more lightly threaded environment GPU temperatures are hotter than we expected for a supposedly efficient design but that could be due to the bio 15 cooling design another possibility for the higher temperatures are those clock speeds MSI pushes them to just over 60 and 60 megahertz which is actually higher than Amy's maximum boost frequency of 1645 megahertz so technically you could consider that as a mild overclock now before I get into the gaming benchmarks I do want to talk about my gaming experience with the Bravo 15 because trying to get some games to run on this machine was a nightmare for instance Red Dead Redemption 2 failed to run on this laptop there were other games like Far Cry 5 and Jedi Order that engaged the integrated GPU instead of the discrete graphics card now this isn't MSI's fault in fact it's more along the lines to do with AMD's drivers and how they work within Windows as of the latest update you see most of the control over the eye GPU and the discrete GPU switching has been added over to Windows which means the operating system can get confused sometimes as to when it needs to switch between one or the other especially when a game launches without exclusive full-screen mode keep in mind that this only happens when an AMD GPU and an AGP is detected not when an nvidia card is installed the only way to get around this is to manually set which graphics processor is used and that isn't done in AMD's control panel anymore you'll need to get into the windows graphic settings make sure classic app is selected and then browse to the game's executable files once that's found you can override the windows default and associate that app with the high performance and discrete card I really really hope that this gets fixed soon because it's a mess right now but luckily this was only an issue that we encountered with a few games speaking of which the results were decent but I think the most interesting aspect of these frame rates is that there are only a few FPS better than the Zephyrs GA 502 T you that I reviewed last year that thing has a pretty slow Ryzen 7 3750h CPU that was probably a bottleneck for a gtx 660ti this notebook has a deep other way around it has a massively powerful 4800H backstopping a pretty weak graphics card so gaming isn't really the brow Dean's strength at least not for the price MSI is charging for it the acoustic performance was respectable it didn't sound like a jet fan like the GS 66 stove so that's welcoming okay so I'm gonna wrap this up quickly the Bravo 15 from MSI isn't really a gaming laptop because when you look at the 4800H it's a good option for people who value CPU processing instead of playing the latest titles and comfortable frame rates because when you're building out a gaming laptop you're looking for something that has a balanced CPU and GPU horsepower you want to make sure that both offers you know relatively good performance but in this case its weakest point is that graphics card the RX 5500M it just it's a weird combination to pair with an 8-core 16-minute processor I think the best analogy is you're trying to you know let it literally retrofit a Ferrari with bicycle wheels I hope that made sense with that being said I have to give credit to MSI for what they've achieved with the Bravo 15 because it offers pretty good build quality for the price the keyboard is nice the trackpad it's loose but I think it's just my sample but if you are in the market looking for a thousand dollar gaming laptop you shouldn't get this you should definitely look somewhere else so on that note thank you so much for watching I hope you were able to take away something from this video stay safe spend responsibly and I'll talk to you guys in the next one",

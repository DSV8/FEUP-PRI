    "transcript": "Okay so this is a cool one! I do a lot of headphones here in UnboxTherapy What do I mean by I do? I do that.. I don't do the headphones A lot of headphones show up, I make a lot of videos about headphones And this is something I haven't seen before These are design your own headphones Street art edition! So they've included some kind of like spray paint some markers you walk around like hey hey who does those headphones like \"I did those headphones\" Isn't it.. eclectic? So it comes from a company called 'Seedling', design your own virtual using maze app design your own marble maze I mean I don't know how that ties in oh a DIY virtual reality viewer This is for somebody who wants to get a little bit crafty wants to be unique let's go ahead jump inside here and see what i can see what i can do We've got the headphones kind of remind me of some Sonys I'm familiar with so they're white for good reason. Markers : red, orange, green, yellow and a couple of spray paint as well. Now that's cool what they did it's like a pump spray because you can't put an aerosol can in here, you know. What's up with these? This feels like a sticker material. What do you do? You cut out your own sticker!? Yeah! That sticky cut out some shapes stick that on there somewhere. I don't really know. It's the beauty of it. It's up to you. Alright, fine. I mean you could do like a wu-tang. That is what I should do. Wu-tang headphones! DIY Wu-tang headphones! The headlines! I just found a headline live in front of all of you. I'm doing wu-tang headphones if it helps sketch your ideas on a piece of scratch paper before you start you'll create reverse stencils to use with your spray paint cut shapes out of the adhesive paper in your kit and peel the backing off Look at us. We're like.. we're graffiti artists instantly. This is kind of the wu-tang yellow but I'm worried about the way the yellow shows up against the white. Maybe we should do the wu-tang not in yellow. Maybe it should be in red. A red spray. Spray it on there. Cover the whole thing with the stencil in the middle and spray the wu-tang w right on each earcup. OK I got an idea I got a idea I got a idea. Get a wu-tang logo on my phone and trace it. What do you think? Probably would show up better if there was less light here. Yeah. So I just got to trace it and then transfer to the sticky paper and I'm going to do the negative space so, color in the perimeter so that the wu-tang logo is the white. Know what I'm saying? Look I'm getting artistical, alright give me a break. Haha that'll do the trick. OK so I do have these little precise scissors somewhere on here. World's most giant swiss army knife. I did a video on this you should go check it out actually. Now of course you could do this with anything that gets you motivated. I mean you all start how motivated I got when I got the wu-tang idea but it's completely up to you. Whoa that's not bad look how my little wu-tang w right there that's really not bad. Okay, cool. Next thing to do is get on the sticky paper to make my stencil. If only I could have seen through this and then... OK cool Well do I cut that out now? Who would've thought it's DIY with Lou? I never thought this day would come. Feel like a kid right now Ha! Hahahaa Okay. Sweet Ha ha ha ha ha Why is this so much fun? This is more fun it should be, alright. What, do I shake it up? I don't know about to find out. Look at that splatter. Are we going to be able to take this out of the table, Jack? We're gonna have to leave that for a while. Alright so I got crazy with the paint as you can tell. Probably not what you're going to do, maybe you'll get the masking tape out and be a little more precise but who cares we're going graffiti-style wu-tang is like a religion Jack! A bomb atomically Socrates philosophies and hypotheses can't define how I be dropping these mockeries. Lyrically performed armed robberies. Flee with the lottery possibly they spotted me! That's what I'm talking about. I left it to dry now I gotta try and peel that wu-tang logo out of there. You only live once as the kids say. Yeah, listen all right there's a reason this show is not called art class would Lou. Right? The spray cans that are included my feeling on that is kind of more of a distance deal you know where you get this kind of spatter. Let me just get some marker going a little bit just see what happened here. Yeah I mean like, this is probably a terrible idea. Oh dear god what have I done? Did you really expect anything less from me though, let's be honest here and there's kids out there in the audience, you're one of them, that could have done a better job, for sure. I want you to do a much better job than this and send me a picture. This looks so much worse with the green now. It looks disgusting. You know what I realised I haven't even listened to these yet. I mean the headphones they don't sound that bad. They work. You know what else Jack? Look at this you can pull the ear cups off. Paint wise, that would have been nice. You know wu-tang I apologize sincerely for this if you want to hit me up, we do a collab, hire some professionals, and make the real wutang headphone. As the world turns I spread like germs. Bless the globe with the pestilence coz the hard-headed never learn",

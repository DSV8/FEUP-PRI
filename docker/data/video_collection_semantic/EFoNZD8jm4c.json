The new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were just what most of us expected from the company, and the \"Apple Watch 2\" doesnt pack many surprises either. But that's less a dig at Apple than a recognition of the fact that sometimes you only need to tweak a few aspects of a winning formula to stay on top. That's a long way of saying that the Apple Watch Series 2 is the best smartwatch you can buy if you're an iPhone user  and one of the best smartwatches you can buy, period.

    "transcript": "- 2016 has been a year of comfortable predictability for Apple. The new iPhones 7 were exactly what we expected from the company, and the revised Apple Watch doesn't pack many surprises either. That is to say, it's the best smart watch you can buy for the iPhone, again. (upbeat music) Cosmetics first: if you liked the first Apple Watch, you'll like the Series 2. The design is the same rounded rectangle with prominent digital crown and squared-off display, a let down if you were hoping for Apple to join the round watch ranks, but I do wanna give the company credit for installing an incredible display. It's really just mesmerizing to watch some of these watch faces, and it's over two times as bright as the first Apple Watch. Moving over to the casing, the space gray option is a welcome addition to the economy choice this year. Yes, this is the aluminum Apple Watch, not the steel Herms or ceramic edition. I did go for the nylon band this year, though, which I think looks pretty cool, even though it holds onto water for a long time after a swim. That's one of the big improvements this year: instead of just splash-proofing, there's 50 meter water-resistance, so you can leave this on for all the baths you like. There's an option to lock the screen, so you don't splash text your exes, and, when it's time to dry off, you get to try out my favorite party trick: spin the crown, and the watch puts out a tone that forces water from the speaker cavity so you can talk on it again. Speaking of speaking, each year I review a new Apple Watch or Samsung Gear, and each year I'm reminded how uncomfortable it is to talk on a wristwatch. You really feel the burn after a minute. The speaker is still not as loud as I'd like, but, if you're in a quiet room, it works just fine. I was surprised at how much I liked using it, actually. And all three callers I talked to said I sounded great. None of them could tell I was using a watch, which surprised me too. You still need to be connected to an iPhone or a wifi network to use most of the watch's features. There's no cellular connection here, but I don't count that against the Apple Watch, just as I don't for my daily wearable, the Moto 360. In my view, smart watches still shine best as second screens for your smartphones, and that's how I make the most use of the Apple Watch; checking notifications as they come in, replying to the occasional message, and remembering to breathe. Just kidding. I disabled it after a day. If you dig it, cool, but it seems so forced, like a move Samsung might have made years ago, disguising a really thin, specialty app as some kind of core enhancement. I don't know. Breathe does serve one important purpose. It calls attention to the re-positioning of the Apple Watch as a health and fitness companion, which wasn't emphasized as strongly in the first generation. Serenity's review over at iMore has the skinny on workouts. My usage was confined to the odd power walk across the city, but, as an occasional outdoorsman, I will say that I loved the inclusion of standalone GPS for tracking a hike or a kayak trip. And Apple Health is still a pleasure to use, from the simple fun of filling the rings to the gentle \"stand up and stretch\" prompt. Those notifications, like all of them, really do feel like a light tap on your skin. Apple's Taptic Engine still makes every other smart watch's vibration feel primitive. I just wish the watch was contextually smarter. I got several of those \"stand up and walk\" suggestions while driving a car, which, you know, is dumb. On the software side, most apps, which have been optimized for watchOS 3, are speedier, once you get past the first boot. I like how many of them are available for the watch, too. The interface is still more complex than it could be overall, but it is somewhat simpler than earlier versions. My personal favorite features were accomplishing simple tasks through voice control with Siri, and paying for coffee without taking out my phone. Old hat for you Apple Watch veterans, I know, but this newb was impressed. Finally, battery life: if you use the watch like I do, and you have the larger 42 millimeter version, you'll almost certainly make it two full days between charges, and that includes wearing the watch as a sleep monitor overnight, which I've made a habit of. Be a little more cautious and you can stretch it out to three, or even four, days until you top up again, as I did before I installed a bunch of apps. Just remember to bring that charger with you on road trips, and, by the way, for the price Apple's asking for the watch, I'm still pretty disappointed that you don't get a nice cradle with it. That price, $369 and up, makes me think most folks will be plenty happy saving a Benjamin and getting a Series 1, or even the release version of the Apple Watch, now retired. Personally, I'd probably go for a Pebble, because 90% of my use case is notifications. I'd say, only if you really need the full-on waterproofing or standalone GPS, should you spring for the Series 2, but, if you do, you'll be getting one version of the best smart watch there is for your iPhone, and, truthfully, one of the best smart watches, period. I saw you looking at that Casio. Check out my review of that monster, and subscribe on YouTube, so you don't miss more Mr. Mobile. Until next time, thanks for watching, and stay mobile, my friends.

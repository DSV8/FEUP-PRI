    "transcript": "What's up guys? Lew here back with a brand new video. And today we're gonna be talking about the newly released iPad Air 2. I've also got the original iPad Air here for a comparison. There are of course some improvements to the new iPad: Is it going to be worth your while? Worth your upgrade? Of course, this unboxing will hopefully help you decide. The new version includes Touch ID now, it's a little bit thinner, a little bit faster Otherwise, fairly similiar. So without any more hesitation, let's go ahead and get this baby sliced open. Now this is the 16GB wifi version, so the base model. There are of course bigger versions available: 64 gigabytes, 128. As you can see on the front of the box here, an incredibly slim design; everyone seems to be working towards this ultra-thin kind of a look. Is it what consumers are asking for? I'm not really sure, everyone I talk to seems to think that extended battery life would be more important. So yes, it's definitely thinner; though, is it really that significant? Hmmm. Ok let me put this other one down for a moment, finish this unboxing. We have the usual plastic covering the actual iPad; this is the Space Gray version, of course it's also available in Silver and Gold. You have your iSight camera on the back, as well as a microphone in that location. On the bottom is where you're gonna find your speaker, as well as the lightning port for charging up the device. The Touch ID lives on the front here, similar to the iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 5S, they all feature a similar or exactly the same Touch ID. You have your forward facing camera; volume buttons are on the side, and the power switch is up on the top. Inside the box we have the usual goodies from Apple, including; the power brick which is a 10 watt. A little tip here is you can use this power brick to charge up your iPhone as well and you can get a slightly quicker charge, by using that slightly larger, more powerful brick. We have the paperwork from Apple, which we have now seen many, many times! Warranty information, the world famous, legendary Apple stickers as well and then a lightning cable to get your device charged, synced, etcetera. Here is the actual iPad, which I'm gonna go ahead and boot up really quickly. Basically identical to the previous version other than the fact that you have a slimmer design. The main story here is the fact that they've gotten it even thinner than before; it's fairly marginal to be honest with you. I mean, you can tell when you're holding it a little bit. Almost forgot to mention, the previous version had a hold switch orientation lock, the new version does away with that, likely due to the slimmer form factor. Honestly guys, not a massive difference here. Of course I can tell the difference, I could identify with my eyes closed which is which, but is it really worth the upgrade? If you've got the previous version iPad Air, I would say no, only because this is a very marginal and iterative update, unless you really need Touch ID or maybe if you're a heavy gamer and you could take advantage of the faster processor, then maybe you want to go ahead and go with the latest one, but otherwise, if you can find a cheap deal on the original iPad Air, that might be a better bet for a significant portion of users. Anyways, so there you have it! The unboxing of the brand new iPad Air 2. Can you tell which is which? Which is old? Which is new? You're not gonna sit here with the original iPad Air, wishing that you could have the slightly thinner version, or maybe you are. There's a lot of people that are early adopters. And Touch ID, on an iPad, not nearly as valuable as having it on a phone for example which you have in your pocket and is out in public more often. I mean it does depend on the way that you use your iPad, but for me, mine is primarily used at home. Alright guys, that wraps up this video. Thanks as always for watching! If you enjoyed this content, please remember to leave a thumbs up down below, and I will catch you on the next one, very shortly. Alright, later guys!",

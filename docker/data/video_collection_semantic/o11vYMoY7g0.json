    "transcript": "- Welcome to \"ShortCircuit.\" Oh, that's heavy. That's a lot heavier than I thought it would be. What's in this mystery box? I don't know, but it's fragile, like my ego, please be nice. (pen striking tape) Come on, ah. \"Hey Linus, we're excited to share with you the latest from Made By Google, Nest Audio. Google's newest smart speaker is especially designed to take your music experience to a whole new level. Nest Audio's sound is clear, natural, and full, and is 75% louder and has a 50% stronger bass than the original Google Home.\" Okay, interesting. I guess they don't wanna leave the Nest. Bwuah, what? How is it still in there? Look at... How, why is this so hard to open? Google, I wanna unbox your product. Ahh, there she blows. The Nest Audio comes in five great colors, which is Sage, Sand, Sky, Chalk, and Charcoal. And we got the Chalk and the Sage. This is a big, heavy box. This is substantial. I can feel the bass. Well, they're all kind of like a washed out color, because that's like their, that's their whole thing. They go for this kind of muted aesthetic, right? It's my style, you know? It's minimalist. They're the type of speakers that fit well into actually my apartment. And if you wanna check out what my apartment aesthetic is like, go check out the Intel Extreme Upgrade on my place. So what Google is doing with this one I think is mainly trying to replace the original Google Home. This one has two speakers, it's got a woofer and a tweeter. Whereas, the original Google Home just had one speaker. It's an improvement in that regard. And obviously, it's updated with all of the new, you know, Google Assistant stuff that maybe, you know, the old Google Home is catching up with a little bit. This is like the Nest product. This is part of Google's transition from the Google Home brand over to the Nest brand. And I think that the last remaining Google Home product that's on sale is the Google Home Max. Let's open her up, shall we? There's a couple of new features also that Google has added that other of their audio products have not had, which include some smart EQ modes. So there's a Media EQ mode, which should, wow, that's heavy, which says that it's supposed to adjust the EQ based on what you're listening to. And then there's an Ambient EQ mode that adjusts the sound based on what's happening in the environment. So that's pretty cool and we're gonna take a look at that. But first, let's find out what we got in the box. But before we do that, we gotta talk about our sponsor, Vessi Footwear. Vessi makes shoes that are both comfortable and functional. They're waterproof, sand proof, and slush proof. Plus, being lightweight and breathable. They also got everyday styling, so they can fit almost any occasion. And if you use the offer code shortcircuit, you can get $25 off on all of their sneakers. So check them out today. Let's get it started in ha So this is like a quick start guide that I probably don't need to look at, because I have a Google Nest Hub, non-Max in my house. So I'll figure it out. Being part of your home means respecting your privacy. So that's a, you know, this is a big thing. I guess they have to address this head-on, because in the past couple of years that's been an issue. So staying along the privacy tack for a second, these have a mute switch on the back, a mic mute switch. So you can set that in the settings or you can also have a hardware switch to turn the mic off completely. The power adapter and cord. Oh, it's not a USB-C, it's a barrel charger, interesting. They look real nice, I gotta say. I was a big fan as soon as Google started putting out products with this sort of like fabric weave design. And it remains really cool looking. Now one thing I didn't mention, is that this product kind of sits in the middle of Google's new audio lineup. So they got the Nest Mini and that is $69. This thing is $99. Another thing about this design is that, as I mentioned, it's flat. The original Google Home was like circular or cylindrical. This one is more flat because I think that Google recognized that you don't need to have 360 sound. Like no one's taking a speaker and just like plopping it in the direct center of their room. And their like, \"That's where it is.\" So they're like, \"Okay, most people are gonna be having it, you know, facing a direction anyway.\" So like, you can put one there, you can put one here, because they also support stereo sound. We're gonna test that out. Whoa! (gentle instrumental music) Okay, so we've set up Nest Audio speaker number one. Before we test out the stereo setup, we're just gonna test out just the one speaker in isolation. I've already connected it and everything. We've got \"Crab Rave,\" ready up and to go. So I'm gonna use the on, device controls. I almost said onscreen controls, but there's no screen. You can play and pause just by tapping on the top once, and volume up and down on the sides. So play. (upbeat music) Also, I need to like face it at me, so I get a... Oh, that's wow, that's very different. Like from when I face it away, it sounds way more muffled than like facing it towards me. (upbeat music continues) (laughing) This song is so stupid, but it's great. There's definitely a lot of bass. (upbeat music continues) Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa! That's max volume! That's pretty good! That's gets pretty loud, I can only imagine what it's gonna be like with the two of them. Now, maybe this is just the song, but like I feel like I heard a bit more separation between the lows and the highs there. Maybe that's just 'cause I know that this thing has a woofer and a tweeter. Okay, here we go. Stereo, stereo mode. Is it gonna drop again, though? That's max audio! Oh! (upbeat music continues loudly) I fear for my eardrums, so I'm gonna stop that. It's a good, good amount of audio levels there. Wow! - [Linus] What the heck is going on over here? - Hi, Linus! - What is this? - Sorry. We're just having a bit of a \"Crab Rave.\" Are you ready to get blown away? (upbeat music) Whoa, ho, ho, ho! Woo, yeah! (upbeat music stops) Wow, suffice to say, it's got a lot of power with one, and if you pair it up for stereo sound, that'll get any rave going all the way to the end of next week. Yeah, I mean definitely a lot of bass. I had a little bit of experience with the Google Home, but I can't say off the top of my head whether it's like significantly better. Although, my heart tells me that it is. - [Nest] Is the left channel. - Right. - [Nest] This is the left channel. - You already said that. Okay, so we know the speaker works, because James made me test the stereo set up with a stereo test track. - [James] It's not dual mono. - Yes! Okay, so one of the last things that I wanted to like test with these things is their Media EQ and Ambient EQ. So I'm gonna go into the EQ settings in the app. Let's see if it changes. (upbeat music) Yeah, I guess there's not really a way I can test that, that Media EQ or Ambient EQ. Oh, maybe I should play a podcast. Oh, I just heard about this really cool new movie podcast called \"Carpool Critics\" movie podcast. You just subscribe on YouTube and on all your podcast platforms. Let's check that out. - [James] From a movie-making perspective, the gauntlet is such a sweet kind of MacGuffin. It's actually all these nested MacGuffins. So again, MacGuffins are the thing that you want, and for \"Pulp Fiction\" it's the briefcase. So the ultimate example of that would be in Pulp Fi- - Is it James? - [Jono] It sounds like James is actually there. - He does? - Yeah. - It does sound pretty nice. Sounds pretty crisp. So I guess they have these EQ features, these like EQ automatic customization features that you can't really test, but that you just have to kind of take their word that it's there. Apparently, this speaker and Amazon Echo speakers as well, like smart speakers in general, a lot of them have this feature where you kind of like over time they adjust to the space anyways. So on top of that, they're saying that they also have this Media EQ feature that will adjust to the media you're playing, and Ambient EQ, which will adjust to the environment. Although I think Ambient EQ only works for podcasts strangely. I mean, so maybe that's a point for you if you're like, \"Hey, that sounds like a cool feature. I want this speaker now.\" But like you gotta take Google at their word that it's there and it's working I guess. Then the other interesting thing about this speaker is that, you know Google is kind of upping their game with the smart speaker market. There's Sonos that exists that this is their whole deal. But their cheapest speaker is the Sonos One, and it's one $199. This thing is $100 less. So you could get two of these speakers and put them in stereo configuration and have a bump'n good time in your living room for the price of the Sonos One. One of Sonos Ones, Sonos' Ones. I like the idea. As I said, I have a Home Mini, I have a Nest Hub, and this is definitely something that I might consider to kind of like pad out, flesh out my whole home audio setup. And also you can't beat the look. They look real nice. And as a minimalist, sort of, I like it. So thanks for sending this, Google. It was fun to play around with. Are we gonna set them up in the office somewhere? Are we gonna put these in the lounge? - [David] No. - David's gonna try and take one home? - No! - Surreptitiously? - No. - What you don't want it? - [David] Looks like a giant AirPods case. - You don't like the way it looks? - [David] No. - And you know what else would be nice? Subscribing to \"Short Circuit,\" the unboxing channel where we take everything out of the box, not just the product, but also our opinions.",

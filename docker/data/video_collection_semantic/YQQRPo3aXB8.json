    "description": "(   ) --- Today's Mystery Video -  Mophie Batteries (USA Link) -  Mophie Batteries (International Link) -   The Mophie battery lineup has expanded big time. It now features batteries with built in combo cables, a USB-C battery and one that even features wireless charging! After seeing these batteries which would you pick? Which is the perfect battery pack?  From the manufacturer -  mophie is regarded as the top mobile power brand worldwide. Our products are recognized for style and engineered for performance, providing a seamless integration of hardware, software and design.  Industry-leading battery life enables our products to hold their charge for an extended period of time, making them more reliable than other battery cases in the market. On average, mophie products retain 75% of their battery capacity after a year without use.  Every mophie battery product is tested at three different stages of production to ensure unmatched capacity, efficiency and build quality along with reliable, long-lasting performance.  When connected to your device, smart charging circuitry communicates with your device to determine the perfect amount of power it needs for a safe, quick charge. Fail-safe circuitry prevents over-charging and controls temperature to prevent overheating.  Enables pass-through charge & sync while connected to a computer. Your device recharges first, and then the juice pack case recharges itself. powerstation products are similar but only enable pass-through charging so you can recharge both your device and powerstation battery at the same time.  Every mophie juice pack is tested to endure the bumps and drops encountered from daily use. Our Impact-Isolation System uses carefully designed and tested internal bumpers that add extra cushion to the edges and corners of the protective case for unrivaled support.  Our products are built to last. Rechargeable for over 500 full cycles, mophie batteries contain first-class lithium-ion polymer cells which have been engineered to deliver the most efficient charge with the highest battery density.

    "transcript": "Feels good to be home~ People send me a lot of things here Today I've got something I really- I have no idea what it is Alright it's from Mophie so, I'm assuming there's a battery type of, conversation we're about to have, about all the cool batteries, for your various gadgets Check out the art work here, this dude in the middle he's obviously the savior Everyone needs a little bit of juice from the man This dosen't look like something you could buy in a store I think Mophie went to the next level here like this is made out of some... It's a serious box, it's heavy *reveals holy grail* *subtle* Whooh Woah! It looks to me, like we are working with, the latest in battery pack solution. So, this is called the Power Station It's got that Rose Gold You could see here couple of USBs. A USB IN for charging it up. Battery indicator on the side. Very slim. What's this guy over here? The Charge Force Power Station. That's a bigger boy. Now this one is 10,000 mAh This guy over here is 6,040 Next up, ooh this one has a nice little curve to it And one of my favorite things ever, built in cable. OHH! LET'S TAKE IT A STEP FURTHER! WHAT!? Micro USB AND Lightning, Jack pick that up, this is important! This is what should have been done a long time ago Alright? These are some of my favourite packs, the one ones that has the cables built-in Line up your phone along side, pull the cable out, put it in like that, and then just have 'em both in your pocket charging at the same time Oooh, this is like Christmas here, Power Station USB C So they took the words right out of my mouth there, so if you're on Oh, I don't know any of the number of USB C devices that are out there Uh, maybe you're on one of these new MacBooks, you get the idea Alright, ok, so, those are the new packs But, look at this Christmas is not over yet, I almost missed that, Jack pick that up! Number 4/10. This is super limited right here Woah Holy moly! O_O Just when you thought they were done So, this goes over the product line a little bit more over here We're looking at 20,000 mAh in a Space Grey, that's gonna match a Space Grey... iPhone or iPad Now there's 2 separate output's on here, 1 AMP, 2.1 AMPS I just realized, ok, this one the Charge Force Power Station, This is actually.. Oh, now this I'ma use, This is actually a wireless charger as well. So, it's a battery backup but also wireless charger You've got your wireless charger that's always with you, but then you got the extra juice that's already in it as well. That is a slim version of this guy It's again that universal adaptable cable Micro USB or lightning If your all about portability, I mean that is smaller than your phone So that's Power Station Mini, again no cable but, super slim So, this one comes in this blue, pink, there's purple, white and black so, *Knock knock who's there interrupting FaceTime* This one here, ahh. Ok, so I'm starting to get it now. This is part of the plus series like this alright, so, 2 smaller sizes then the big boy with the cable built in Those are the different series Now- Oh my *laughs*, they hit me with the cables too, look, lots of really short ones I get way to excited about short cables Little short micro USB cables, a couple of USB C cables So, there you have it Let me know in the comments, which is your favorite? Is it all about wireless charging for you? Is it about having the built in cable? Do you need a big one, do you want a small one? It looks to me like, they've really expanded their product line, here. I'm gonna go with the wireless, I've been using the S7. You guys might not know this, but I've been using an S7 with a juice pack on it Okay? On this device heres giving me twice as much battery life, I carry this with me. And I'm on some kind of Iron Man level Boom, boom Wireless charging on the back up battery. Be the Juice Man Your gadgets depend on it ... So does your life.",

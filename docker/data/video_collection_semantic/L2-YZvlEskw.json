    "transcript": "*cough cough cough* What's up guys! Lew here, back with a brand new video and today we are taking a look at something that is exciting. And I know I say that every single time But this one is really exciting to me I've been waiting for it for a little while And by that I mean not like waiting in the mail Not like there has been a package in the mail for far too long. But I just never got around to picking one up This is a GoPro, it is the Hero 4 black edition It is 4K in the palm of your hand Like the title of this video implies It's a tiny little camera that can shoot 4K at 30FPS Or it can shoot higher frame rate for slow motion at 1080p It really has a huge number of different recording formats and like all other GoPro products you have a huge number accessories and mounts so that you can use it in a number of different environments including harsh once this thing is tough it's rugged and the reason I picked one up. Little of a long winded introduction. Is cause I'm going to be shooting some hockey stuff Now many of you don't know I'm actually a hockey player myself I still play twice a week even though I'm an old man so many take a couple in these one the ice along with some other equipment to see when so see if I can get some cool shots so anyways here we have it the hero for black addition you have the camera the standard housing a rechargeable battery a couple of mounts, skeleton backdoor USB cable quick release buckles in a pivot arm also it requires class 10 memory or you HS 1 and that's micro SD so there's not a huge selection on the market but I'm gonna try to link some popular choices that are approved by GoPro down in a description because as you know with 4k video it's gonna require a fairly fast card, what am I talking about this isn't hard to get into. I feel like the old version was a lot more difficult to open up then this one is. Either that or I'm just a pro now this is the top of the line version so there is a silver version as well which doesn't shoot 4k body actually has a feature that is Black Edition doesn't have an LCD, a touchscreen LCD on the back of it that's not a huge deal for me these things are so wide when the shoot video that you don't really need to see what you're shooting point-and-shoot literally just aim this thing and it's probably in the frame plus if you absolutely need an LCD you can always add the optional accessory to the Black Edition and of course I wanted the 4K recording so you can see its in a basic housing here which I'll open up real quick you know a thing or two about go pros I just havn't gotten this version yet look how tiny these are that gets me every single time just how tiny the GoPro is but that's a huge selling feature of the GoPro it's the reason these cameras are so popular one of the reasons you can stick them anywhere anywhere also inside the package we have the remaining accessories and these are what really puts the GoPro into action there is Keith skeleton backdoor a couple of 3m mounts so different mounting arms over here the little battery which course you can get an extra one and keep that on hand so you don't run out in the old days replacing the batteries go prose was a little bit harder to do and then you had a mini-usb cable obviously it's going to be used to charge up the device this mount on the top looks to be sort of part of the plate your not getting that off you have no extra mount see the thing is here you can get like motorsport accessories you can get a diving accessories helmet mounts and so most people get these will sorta expand on their GoPro package as time goes on but this is your very basic housing here to taking a closer look at the tiny little GoPro Hero black addition you'll notice it has fairly simple input you just have this power slash mode button a little LCD above there with some indicator lights you've also got button on the top on the device that's going to be your record button along with another light indicator on this side of the device you have a settings button and then on the back you have this expansion port as I mentioned before that port can be used for expanding to either an LCD backpack if you wanna see what your recording or interface with the device that way before it can be used for a battery backup for example if you wanna get extended battery life on the bottom you have a little door where your batteries gonna live here internal battery and then the remainder a pure I O happens over here on the side here you had in HDMI output as well as a USB output and named a micro SD card slot has said mention before you're gonna need a fairly high speed micro SD take advantage of those high bitrate recording modes that the Black Edition Hero 4 supports to that wraps up this unboxing and overview the GoPro Hero four black addition you guys are interested in pricing and availability in you wanna shoot 4k in the palm of your hand and I would drop a link to this down in the description and since it is a camera it only makes sense to show you guys some sample footage so I will layer some in at the very end of this video but before we get there I want to give a shout out to the AT&T YouTube channel because I did a couple videos for them that's right yours truly featured on the official AT&T YouTube channel you see how far we've come me you all of us together so I did a couple of unboxing's for them and they wanted to get unbox therapy treatment so I unboxed the Note 4 AT&T version as well as LG G watch R are which I don't believe that video is up yet but anyways I'll link whatever's available down in the description so go show some support and some love that wrap this one up thanks as always for watching now let's roll into you that footage from this hero for Black Edition check this out",

    "transcript": "this video is brought to you by Squarespace look folks domain website online store it really doesn't matter what you need you can do it all over at squarespace.com tack on a forward slash science studio to get 10% off your first purchase it's linked in this video's description I'd like to preface this playlist with a bit of insight into why I even bother making these types of videos these aren't science videos per se they're just street smart videos if you're a new to PCC building and you're interested in buying a new or used PC and either market then I recommend watching a video like this if you're gonna shop on Facebook on Craigslist on ebay anywhere else in the world for a used PC especially be aware of when you're being scammed that's not to say that everyone out there is going to rip you off in fact I would argue that more people than not are going to be genuinely interested in selling you a component a PC or something along those lines for a decent price because they know that it's either been just devalued over time or they need the cash quickly so what I'm gonna show you mostly bad deals there are a few good ones that I found but Facebook marketplaces it's littered with some garbage so that's what this video is I read terrible ads facebook marketplace edition by popular demand alright so we're gonna jump right into this now for those who are not familiar Facebook marketplace is basically Craigslist just pretend it's Craigslist but anybody anywhere can sell anything first on our list this is a fifteen hundred dollar asking price gaming PC from Pensacola Florida a 50 watt power supply AMD FX 6300 and r9 390 volcano graphics card he's got a 250 gig SSD okay not too bad 16 gigs of ram but there's really nothing appealing here and I'm not sure where he's getting the $1500 asking price what do you have next year okay custom-built gaming and developer workstation PC asking price twenty eight hundred and thirty-five dollars from Dothan Alabama this is an oddly specific price for this PC and good game you got yourself in the shot there this PC utilizes the MDOT 2 specification for its hard drive that's not a hard drive that's an MDOT - it's a solid-state drive which means it's nearly 100 times faster than any HDD you can buy current Preval computers don't even compare with MDOT to available because it's such a new technology down to the specs i7 7700 K GTX 10 32 gigs of tread NZ ddr4 one terabyte him got to okay he didn't cheap out on the m-dot - that's for sure we got an H X 850 850 watt power supply you put it in a 570 X from Corsair that's really the extent of the build though and he's asking for nearly three grand just in case you're new to pcs terrible deal here we go four hundred and fifty dollar gaming PC for low to medium games gtx 660 eight gigs of ram not sure what the cpu is you should probably list that if you're gonna sell a computer like this that looks like an AMD cooler so i'm gonna assume maybe like an FX 6300 or FX 4300 i can't really tell all this is good though can throw in the 320 gig hard drive for the right price that the hard drives gonna cost like ten dollars Jesus alright let's go on yukio cards for in gaming pcs pretty straight up about he's not trying to be sly or anything I'm not sure what the value of these yugioh cards are I haven't played in a long time but 420 bucks should get him a decent starter rig if you can find some used parts that's really all I wanted to show you here it's pretty funny alright what do we have here 2500 dollar gaming PC this rig can play in 1440p at no ease and also 4k 6700 K at 4.5 gigahertz intel SSD 400 gig hard drive it's not a hard drive though it's an SSD there's a difference hard drives are not solid state drives totally different 16 gigs of ram 750 watt power supply in a GTX 1080 alright but I'm looking for what he has in this rig that's making him come to the conclusion that it's worth $2,500 I know I thought this one was pretty cool at first glance he's got an i7 7700 K in there - GTX 1080 T eyes and NZXT s340 elite custom loop looks really clean right and then I found out that he's only including one graphics card when you buy it with only 110 atti sorry dude not gonna cut it custom yeah me PC workstation computer Intel Core i5 set I don't know if you can call a computer with an i5 in it a workstation PC seems a little clickbait D to me 3/8 gig sticks of RAM nothing wrong with that is just kind of weird 1070 at 760 T case a 1 terabyte SSD a CX 850 M power supply he's including Windows 10 that's good 8 fans and let's see I don't think he's including this 144 Hertz for okay monitor no he's not no apparently he sells them on the side interesting $2,200 my conclusion is nay what is this pc parts i7 gaming pc alright so the CPU motherboard must be sold together that kind of makes sense right I 747 90 K and an ASUS Maximus hero 7 so he wants 270 bucks for that this is actually a pretty solid deal here that i7 that's as well but you could still probably squeak out around 200 bucks that's I think a fair price for an older i7 but even that has well if not that old so anywhere in the two hundreds is solid for an i7 plus he's including the motherboard basically free of charge or just really cheap which is nice I wonder if he's including the RAM no because that's not in this list maybe he's just moving that to a different build but that alone just the two hundred seventy dollars for that combo is pretty cool $750 gaming PC in Tallahassee Florida can run many games at Mac settings you know this is good when he starts the whole ad off with this sentence here 16 gigs of ram FX 8350 kind of saw that coming and let's see he's got an NVIDIA GTX 660 and a GT 610 was using one for physics 850 pro 256 gig SSD in a 1.8 terabyte hard disk drive $750 is not gonna cut it what do we have here t 5810 gaming PC pretty sure that's a Xeon rig that's that's a server build not necessarily a gaming rig I'll have to double check on that 64 gigs of ram sounding more like a server than anything else one terabyte solid-state drive and a gtx 1070 video card prices not negotiable this whole built just doesn't make sense Oh what with that classic UV green coolant did we up for sale here is a PC I built from the ground up building computers for almost 20 years and let's see Plasti Dip the case so you put a lot of time and effort in this had Plexiglas custom cut LGA 48 20 K 16 gigs of course there Dom Platts she's got two 980 s an SLI interesting an issue sorry gee grandpa ch4 Black Edition LGA 2011 motherboard and a bunch of fans he's got a course there HX 1000 I for absolutely no reason 250 gigabytes Samsung SSD 840 pro I'm more or less just concerned about the value of the custom loop gear I'm wondering if he's accounting for all those costs or a piece kind of given us a discount here it'd be difficult to break it all down but he's got a lot of stuff going on in here I don't recommend anyone looking to buy a PC pre-built go with a custom loop rig it's just it's really hard for me to recommend that because this is gonna require so much maintenance in the long run this is a gaming PC and monitor McKinney Texas $1,000 bought this gaming PC and monitor in June just don't use anymore okay works great we'll send specs to serious buyers are you kidding me why on earth would you even bother posting an ad if you're not gonna list of specifications really it's just more work for both of us just make it simple I'm gonna assume this is just a terrible bill because you're too shy to put the specs on screen brand-new high-end gaming desktop this is uh it's actually near my hometown Panama City Beach Florida $2,000 amazing custom-built gaming desktop this will shred any game and it's ready for 4k gaming or VR i7 7700 K gigabyte gaming motherboard a little sketched out though by the motherboard because it doesn't look like a top to your board I'm curious as to whether or not that is even a Z 270 board it might be a be 250 board mapa check he's got one 16 gig stick of ddr4 little strange three terabyte hardest drive 500 gig SSD a gigabyte horas 1080 is 650 watt power supply you plus and the Corsair crystal 460 X oh but check this out he hasn't installed it yet but he's planning on putting in a nice Wi-Fi card I love this I got a ramp for a second here never been overclocked or abused so you're telling me that you have a 7700 can you rigged with an aftermarket CPU cooler and you never tinkered with the overclock either that or this guy's doing the same thing the guy in the last video did he just paired an unlocked CPU with a locked chipset so he can't overclock even if he wants to we got a custom 4k gaming PC from would--we Texas $59 asking price but this one I did a little research beforehand he actually priced it out fairly so he can I 570 600 K which will do decent in games not the best but it's close to GTX 10 80s and SLI and then he's got what 2 terabytes of hard disk drives in raid 0 this is the two on the basement and he's got a 120 gig SSD for the operating system in zxd Kraken X 52 and he's accepting paypal for those interested yeah I gotta say this one really isn't a bad deal if you want to buy a monitor from he's also selling that so I want to hit this guy up seriously I mean for the two graphics cards alone especially what the mining craze the way it is although graphics card prices are starting to go down just a little bit at least in the 1080 side because they're not the best mining cards hache per watt anyway this is still a decently priced PC now to end this video I want to show you how I was searching through Facebook Marketplace maybe want to do something similar on your channel or just in your spare time find some decent deals out there they do exist on this on this site you can sign in to your Facebook account it is required actually to do anything here if you don't sign in and it's not gonna let you search it will probably pull your location we can search really anywhere so let's type in Seattle Washington and there we go now you can type in what you're looking for let's do gaming pc and the top searches should have to do with what you were looking for here we go this is a juicy one so ultimate gaming pc 4k and virtual reality ready GT x 1080 custom loop so you see my point super simple to use I invite you to just give it a shot see what you can find in your local area so we've seen the good the few that I showed of the bad there were plenty of those to choose from and the ugly now what I want you to do this is my call to action in this video is to go on to your local Facebook market place hype in gaming PC or something along those lines and see what kind of deals you can find if any exist at all my takeaway from this Facebook market place it's got a lot of crap I'd say as much if not more crap than Craigslist and that's saying something if you liked this video be sure to give this one a thumbs up I do appreciate that also leave suggestions for future I read videos on this playlist and click the subscribe button it's at red button

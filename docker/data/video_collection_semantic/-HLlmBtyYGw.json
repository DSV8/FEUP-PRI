    "transcript": "good people I'm Dimitri and I've always tried to stay clear of bad audio products and for the longest time I wanted to try schiit audio and today is the day Gigi how do you say that without getting demonetised good luck you guys should know by now that my gaming accessories and peripherals are never constant I have the privilege of switching out keyboards every few months I have three daily driver mice and my selection of audio follows the same behavior until now I have finally settled on a proper gaming audio set that will be on my gaming station for a while let me tell you why after this the new corsair came out if I have platinum RGB XT lets you program the six macro keys on the left to work beautifully with stream deck for endless customization while you stream or gain plus P V T key caps a comfy rest rest and a quality k95 body check it out below all right so let me retrace my audio history for a bit of context so when the Sennheiser GSX 1000 came out the experience was absolutely incredible with their binaural engine that opened up any audio environment and for non-competitive gaming it was brilliant I did the full audio experience piece right over here and the difference between enabling that 7.1 surround sound experience versus done is they did a really good job and it is one of the best implementations of surround sound I've ever heard I really loved the natural sound stage expansion combined with open pair of headphones especially was brilliant but I eventually swapped it out for something more powerful because the GSX 1000 could not drive some of my headphones and this is where the element comes in from JDS labs this is a really nice amplifier and DAC with beautiful tones and a lot of power behind it I was using the element for months and the only reason I stopped it was because it required wall power and that was going through a stage of like reconfiguring all my cable management and I wanted something that was running off a single USB port and I also was looking for something that had and mic input on the same breakout box which is when the latest Sound Blaster x3 had entered the chat and this is a really good sound card with lots of i/o and their own variation of surround sound rendering with the full software suite available and by default the x3 in stereo mode is fantastic beautiful sound can drive any of my headphones but it is so feature-rich and I was never using any of its like surround sound as sexify and in noise cancellation profiles that I actually switched to a USB said instead for simplicity sake and this is the HyperX orbit s this pair has planar magnetic drivers which are incredible with absolutely delicious bass quality yes that's right delicious bass quality I've been editing with them too but once the full shake came out it was time to go back to the roots with a proper comfortable pair of headphones so now we're all cut up to present day so with regards to the Fulla 3 I love the simplicity of this package cool industrial look with metal casing small on desk footprint nor driver software needed and we've got a quality headphone out and mic in the volume knob is kind of big for the body with a not so visible indicator but it's smooth and stable you can plug in powered monitors at the back and we also have an analogue input if you want to use the full of three just as an amplifier there's also an additional USB port that can be powered via and battery banks so you can use this thing as an amplifier when you're mobile it kind of sucks it's not used b-type see it's 20/20 after all and only a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack instead of a full-size but that's why the hell exists which is bigger better more expensive and gives users more control it's really interesting to see how both of these are labelled as like gaming amp dac's because of the mic input but I also appreciate the lack of any software because I don't really see it as necessary for example I never play with surround sound on I don't really change my EQ profiles I just have my good pair of headphones that I use for gaming and that is it so when I don't think the microphone the HD 58X is fantastic with the fool of three at half the power get wonderful sound so incredible detail somewhat Airy bass nice soundstage and that for games that I play is absolutely the perfect formula I'm really comfortable with 58X on the fulla 3 in terms of positional awareness so on games like Cod EFT and of course years go this audio setup has not failed me once now you might be thinking what is the main difference between the Fulla 3 which is an entry-level inexpensive DAC and combo versus something that might already be included with your gaming headset like this USB sound card that is included with my G Pro X headset so first of all power is a major difference here the Fulla 3 can drive my HD 58X no problem my HE4XX planar magnetics as well while the USB dongle it simply cannot at the hundred percent volume here I feel like it's still missing a lot of the detail I feel like I need more volume to get the most out of headphones while the 4:3 it's good its adequate enough to support majority of headphones that will you'll be happy with being powered by a $99 and a cam combo and the second thing is detail I feel like there's more perceived layering with the full of three verses using the USB dongle while this thing has a little extra base which has surprised me and like not bad bass either but the fulla 3 is very neutral and there is more layering and a sound more definition overall and stepping things up with the hel man this thing is legit so it requires wall power it lights up to complement the red exterior we have a gain switch beside the full 6.3 millimeter headphone jack and even microphone level knob to control your voice volume so the main difference between the two is that the hell is four times more powerful than the full of three we have more controls here more knobs and like an actual mic gain which is awesome and this thing has a mic stereo input versus a standard model and to be honest the extra power of the hel isn't my style I'm perfectly satisfied with the power output of the Fulla 3 plus I really appreciate that compact footprint of that amplifier but let me know which microphone sounds best to you between all these products so this is the bare-bones fulla 3 it has a pretty loud vocal pickup and you cannot adjust the levels on the actual device you can go into the settings and reduce the level if this thing is too sensitive but there is a bit of processing happening but the processing is compression so compressing the the voice adding a bit of more bass and there's aggressive noise cancellation for the background so I would say it's a good thing and I've never had a complaint what you listen to now is that recorded by the hel and given we have actual full on microphone gain control that is great in case you're peaking or you're not loud enough you can adjust that on the fly and this one I think sounds slightly cleaner there is a bit more processing a little bit more bass but overall it doesn't sound as harsh as the full of three in comparison they both sound pretty decent but the hell definitely has a bit of an edge finally here's the x3 by Sound Blaster I think this one has the best sound cancellation of the background it's a much cleaner noise floor but the processing that is happening here is also brilliant I think it's the best sounding microphone out of the entire amp that collection that I have here so a really good job and it sounds natural detailed nice bass in there but it is a bit quiet so you have to boost the actual gain for the microphone to be more audible in-game it is pretty cool to see this type of quality in terms of microphone and sound on an Amp/DAC combo that is only $20 more expensive than the full of three but it also comes with your traditional gaming loaded features so I guess that makes sense and finally here's the sound sample of the microphone plugged directly into my motherboard and this one has a bit more digital noise in the background because of all the interference and all the hardware that's happening but it still sounds pretty decent I do think the Sound Blaster x3 is the best out of the four but let me know if you agree and which one sounded best to your ears and the last piece of the puzzle is the gaming headset so this is my gaming headset of choice this is the game one or rebranded by drop PC 37X that complements full of three perfectly it is open back so I'm not completely audio isolated from myspace and that is a benefit for me this is by far the most comfortable gaming headset design its audio signature a sharp with a flat base profile and I do not miss a sound plus the microphone is fantastic I have like the benchmark for gaming headset when it comes to voice quality and when I don't need the microphone its HD 58X all the way now what these two products made me realize is that Schiit audio is doing a really good job trying to cater to the gaming audience deliver premium-quality dak am combos with mic inputs that don't suck in my opinion this is the way it should be without all the value are gaming things like surround sound noise cancellation eq's and profiles and etc in my experience I've never used those things extensively and always revert to like default stock configuration on any DAC and combo headset or whatever I really appreciate the convenient plug and play bare-bones nature of the Fulla 3 over any other DAC amp combo that has come through my space which is why the Fulla 3 and the HD58X plus the PC37x Game One is my perfect gaming audio set really curious to hear what is your perfect gaming audio setup let me know in the comments I'm a Dmitri thanks so much for watching check out this other relevant content all the links would be listed in

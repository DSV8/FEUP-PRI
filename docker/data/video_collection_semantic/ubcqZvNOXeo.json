    "transcript": "so you've got two choices in life you can be spied on constantly all your data monitored or you could decide to degoogle your phone and stop the spying I like what it says here on the CalyxOS website your phone should be private everyone needs a phone not everyone wants to be spied on reclaim your privacy with CalyxOS so if you want to start your journey towards privacy have a look at CalyxOS I'm going to show you this video how to take a pixel 8 Pro running standard Android and replace it or flash it with CalyxOS I really want to thank Brilliant for sponsoring this video do you know how technology works as an example how strong passwords work Brilliant has this interactive course that shows you how strong passwords work this is really important in today's world and unfortunately a lot of people still use weak passwords so let's look at password theft what I really like about Brilliant's training is it's very interactive so as an example do you know the answer to this question the password you choose was at least eight characters long if it takes a hack of 5 seconds per guess how long do you think it would take them to try every possible eight character password few hours a few months or millions of years what do you think answer is millions of years they could use a script to automate the password guessing now you can try everything on Brilliant for free for 30 days use my link below https://Brilliant.org/DavidBombal you'll also get 20% off an annual premium subscription you can really change your life through education and I really want to thank Brilliant for doing that but but also for supporting my channel now the first thing you need to check is which handsets or phones are supported so on the CalyxOS website if I scroll down we can see modern devices such as the pixel phones so notice pixel 8 Pro pixel 7 Pro etc we've got Fairphones so four and five we've got various Motorola phones those are modern devices extended support is available for these pixels so notice even down to a pixel 3 we've got a shift phone these phones are no longer supported such as the OnePlus etc Calyx then shows us some features on their website and I'll quickly just go through some of them as an example signal is installed by default so rather than using SMS's which are ain't secure when you talk to someone the idea is to use Signal much better privacy focused encrypted messaging application Tor is built- in as well so if you want to browse anonymously you can use Tor built into the Operating System you can also as mentioned download your favorite apps from the F-Droid Store or the Aurora store microG replaces some of the functions of the Google Play services while maintaining much more anonymity and privacy completely optional so the idea here is rather than giving Google your Google ID where they can track you we'll use another account and then be able to download the applications anonymously okay so that's enough talking let's get started so first thing on the CalyxOS website I'm going to click Get CalyxOS scroll down here I'm going to install it on my phone so I'm going to click install we need to choose the device model so obviously you need to make sure which device you're using so on this phone I'll go to settings and I'll scroll down and go to about phone and you can see this is a pixel 8 Pro so that's the phone that I'm going to use so pixel 8 Pro and I'm going to install the software using Windows now in previous videos I got a lot of flack from people saying oh you want to use a privacy phone but you're using Windows now just notes I use Linux I use Mac OS and I use Windows typically I only use Windows for demonstrations just because it reaches a broader range of people so I'm going to show you how to install CalyxOS using a Windows computer even though that's not typically what I use that's just to make it available to a broader audience because more people use Windows than perhaps Linux now to make it easier my team and I have created a PDF which you can download using the link below that shows you all the steps on how to get CalyxOS installed in this example we were using a pixel 6A for the creation of this PDF but I'm going to demonstrate using a pixel 8 Pro steps are basically the same but we've done a lot of work creating screenshots showing you how to set this up and includes all the screenshots showing you what you need to do as an example turning your phone off and removing the SIM card as the first step and then enabling options such as developer options so that's a lot more detailed than they've got on the CalyxOS website as an example they just tell you to do this enable developer options but we're showing you visually how to do that again I don't have a SIM card installed on this phone so just to show you the full process I'll swipe up and I'll go to settings scroll down about phone you can see it's a pixel 8 Pro what we're going to do is scroll all the way down and press build number seven times to enable developer options I have to put in my password and notice we are now a developer so first step enable developer options next thing we need to do enable USB debugging and enable OEM unlocking so go back here go to system scroll down go to developer options you can see we've got developer options enabled here we going to scroll down and make sure that OEM unlocking is enabled so if that's not enabled we want to enable that option so I'm going to allow OEM unlocking and we want to allow USB debugging so I'll select that option as well well and click okay okay next thing we need to do is prepare the host computer so we need to download USB drivers for Windows in this example once again I'm using a Windows computer so I'm going to download the Google USB driver so on this page I'm going to click download the Google USB driver zip file you have to agree to the terms and conditions and then click download to download it so what I'll do here is I'll create another folder I've already done this previously so I'll just call this cCalyxOS2 coz I've already changed one phone to CalyxOS but I'll install that driver there and as you can see once again in the PDF all those steps are shown okay so what I'm going to do now is unzip the file so extract all the files and then I'm going to right click on this android_winusb.inf file and click install we're told that it's an unknown publisher I'm going to click open and you can see the verified publish is Microsoft Windows File is installed now this didn't show in my recording because I previously installed it but you'll get a prompt like this would you like to install this device driver from Google so we're downloading this driver from the android.com website so from Google Google is the publisher so you need to install the software and then click okay so very basic installation okay scrolling down we need to download the device flasher so download device flasher to the folder okay so in my CalyxOS directory I've got the device flasher and what I'll do is open up CMD prompt directly here so if I type DIR you can see that the device flash. exe file is in that directory now this will depend on your phone in this example I've got a pixel 8 Pro in the document we were using a pixel 6A so the hash of the file is different because it's a different file so on this phone I'm going to use this command to check the hash so copy that paste that in here you can see the hash starts with 111 ends in in 70a3 that's the hash that they've given us so you could check the entire hash to make sure that it matches this is once again a unique digest of the device flash if it doesn't match you may have a corrupt file or incorrect file so if it's not the same file redownload the file and make sure that it's the correct one for your phone next thing we need to do is download the CalyxOS Operating System so I'm going to click save to save that now this is a 2 gig file so it's going to take a while to download so now is a good time to perhaps get a coffee while that downloads obviously depends on your internet speed now we're told this will only work for Pixel 8 Pro Husky I've downloaded the file for my specific phone the one that you download will be a different one you need to make sure that it's the right software otherwise it may break your device now fortunately when I was testing this I actually used the wrong image with a phone and CalyxOS blocked me so it didn't allow me to install the wrong image on the phone but just be careful when you're flashing a phone you do run the risk of breaking it or killing your phone so that's a risk that you need to take for yourself when flashing a device like this okay we told do not extract or rename the zip file simply download as it is and once downloaded we can verify the image again you want to make sure that everything matches correctly that you've got the correct files okay file is now downloaded so if I open up my directory we can see it there what we now told to do is check the hash of the file so I'll copy this command paste it in and you can see that's the hash starts with 627 ends in 687 and that's the hash that we want so that looks good now if you really want to make sure that the file is correct you can download the signature file but we're not going to worry about that here now we need to run the device flasher and Flash the device so you need to make sure that both the CalyxOS image and the device flash are in the same directory so if I clear my screen and type Dir flasher and file are in the same directory so that's good and now we can run the device flasher by double clicking on device flasher to run it now just before I do that notice antivirus may flag this as infected because the program was written in the go language you can have a look at the FAQs if you want more information we also told that we may need to unlock the Bootloader okay so what we need to do is connect the computer to the phone so I'll connect this via USB cable okay so that's now connected I now need to double click the device flasher double click on that file now we told that there's a problem with this file Windows Defender stopped it but for this to work you need to run this anyway so you need to make a decision whether you want to run that file or not I'm going to allow USB debugging okay so there's various things that we told here like connect to Wi-Fi network and ensure that no SIM cards are installed enable developer options we've done that enable USB debugging we've done that enable OEM unlocking in the same developer menus option so you could just make sure that that's done so notice OEM unlocking is enabled you can see USB debugging is enabled and we've enabled developer options on the phone so I'm going to press enter to continue now it tells us devices to be flashed is husky in this case so it's detected the right phone previously when I connected the wrong phone and tried to do this it told me that the phone wasn't found so now I press enter to continue now this process is going to take a while notice the phone is rebooted you need to be patient now while it installs the software it may take a while to go through all the steps but we are told here please use the volume and power keys on the device to unlock the bootloader so we can see it says do not unlock the bootloader I'm going to use the volume buttons to unlock the bootloader and then the power button to select it okay so that's been done now and notice now it starts flashing you just need to wait for it to happen so there was quite a pause between me unlocking the bootloader to the software flashing the device it's now doing various things notice the phone is turning on and off multiple times you literally now just need to wait for quite a while while it's flashing the phone rebooting the phone and so forth so here's an example you can see fastbootd you can see that it's sending large files to the phone again just wait for this process to complete okay so now we're told please use the volume and power keys on the device to lock the bootloader so it was blank for a while but now the following is displayed so I'm going to lock the boot loader using the volume buttons and then power to select it so boot loader is now locked okay so the command prompt or terminal window on my Windows computer is now closed and you can see that the phone is now booting and there you go it says welcome to CalyxOS now in the documentation on the website it says you've now got the phone running but in the PDF we now show you the steps to get it set up so bunch of screenshots here that can help you get it set up so first thing I'll do is say start select where I am which is the UK click next now you'll need to enable WiFi if you want to install apps in the upcoming steps so in this document we show you how to install various apps so you'll need to connect to the Wi-Fi network for that to work so what I'll do here is unplug the USB cable and then I'll connect it to the Wi-Fi network okay so I've connected to the Wi-Fi network we now told that a SIM card is missing I'm okay with that so I'm going to say next date and time is shown I'm going to say next we can restore apps if we want to I'm not going to do that here so I'm going to click skip now you may want to enable location services as an example if you want to use the maps app you're going to to need location services to see where you're at so I'm going to say next specify a pin you could set up a fingerprint I'm not going to do that now this is what's interesting here we are using microg which is an open source replacement for Google services so we get access to Google services without all the tracking so we're going to allow that and say next now you can install additional apps here I'm going to install all of them because I want the Aurora store as an example so I want to install that there's also other useful software here like the Calyx VPN we have a Google Maps replacement we can also get rid of exf data on our photos we may also want to install the Tor Browser so I'm going to say install to install all of that software this again is what's really nice about calx OS it gives you a degoogle phone but with a whole bunch of applications ready to go out of the box very easy to get up and running with this now you can choose your theme you might want to go for dark I prefer that or light but just to be consistent with the video I'll select light you can specify your preferred navigation method I'll just go with the default and say next and then say start and there you go I've now got CalyxOS installed with a bunch of applications okay so if I scroll up you can see various applications here including the Aurora store including the F-Droid store so as an example if I go to the Aurora store I can choose various options I can click next choose various installations I'm just going to go with a session installer say next go with a system default say next you could enable various app links I'm not going to do that say next and then say finish so I literally just went with the defaults and notice here you could log in using a Google account or an anonymous account or a Anonymous insecure account so I'm going to choose anonymous because I want to log in and get access to Google apps but not using my Google ID now you may have issue sometimes with doing this you may have to try this multiple times but I'll just show you one example let's I want to install Instagram I can do that and notice the installation is happening here and I can click install to install it notice the application is downloading okay now I can press open and there you go I've got Instagram running on this CalyxOS phone so again if I scroll up there's Instagram you can use the Aurora store or you can use F-droid this comes out of the box once again with CalyxOS makes it very easy to install applications especially if you're not used to a operating system so what I'll install here is Termux so Termux terminal emulator so I'll download that press install Termux is now installed and I can press open to open it I won't allow notifications but notice there I've got Termux installed uname - a shows us that we're running Linux now on the CalyxOS website once again in their documentation they have a lot of really useful information they talk about App stores such as F-Droid and Aurora so if you need more information about what these stores actually are then have a look on the CalyxOS documentation they show you the applications that are included so once again you've got a VPN you've also got the Tor browser so that's built- in straight away so I can just start the tour browser they also have Signal so private messaging available right away organic Maps allows us to use maps so I'm going to allow it to find my you need to download the world map and then you need to enable location settings which I've done and then I can specify my location okay so app locations I'm going to change use location and then I can specify my location and it can find me and I won't zoom in here but notice you can see that I'm in the UK what's also very nice is it has a built-in firewall so you can decide what permissions you give an application so for Instagram as an example we can decide are we going to allow Instagram to have background network access allow it to use Wi-Fi data mobile data allow it to use VPNs Etc so you can simply turn off options here for various applications so last app let's look at scrambled Exif data now Exif data allows people to find out where you are when you upload photos to various sites a lot of social media sites will strip that information but that doesn't mean that those sites don't have that information so you could strip your Exif data before you upload a photo to some photo sharing website one more really nice feature is it has this work profile option so the idea is is that you can set up two versions of the phone if you like or two phones one for work one for personal or one for personal one for another use so notice you I have to go through the entire process once again and download the applications that I want to use so in this example I'll just skip the applications so notice here personal I have Instagram but on work there's no Instagram very few applications are shown here again personal Instagram work profile no Instagram so you can have two different profiles or two settings that are separated from one another so applications in one profile don't get access to the other profile as an example if I take a photo in the work profile so I'll just take a photo of that keyboard as an example if I go to Gallery notice I can see those two photos but if I go to my personal profile and go to Gallery notice no photos are found so in the personal profile no photos are found in the work profile my photos are found so separation of the applications between two different profiles okay I think that's enough I've now shown you how to install CalyxOS on a pixel phone process is very similar whether you're using a pixel 6 as an example or 7 or8 all the instructions are available on the CalyxOS website for specific phones and once again I have shared a PDF that shows you how to do this step by step if you want to use that but what do you think do you use CalyxOS do you use Graphine what's your preferred degoogle operating system or are you just stuck on standard Android I think it's really important to be aware of the tracking that's taking place these days more and more companies are tracking more and more data Microsoft recently just announced recall which I think is a crazy idea where they are taking screenshots of your computer every few seconds and then feeding that to an AI I think this tracking this monitoring of us needs to stop you need to start taking back your privacy stop allowing companies tracking everything that you're doing please put in the comments below your thoughts about CalyxOS graphine or perhaps other deg Googled operating systems if you

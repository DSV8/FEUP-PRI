    "transcript": "- It's freaky Friday. - [Man] Wow, watch out! - So, you tried and failed to buy one of the next gen consoles this week. And you failed, and you tried and failed. Well, don't fail too bad as those evil people who were able to hit the order button like one millisecond before you did, are having their own problems. Some Xbox Series X units are making a clicking noise that reportedly has something to do with either the hard drive or the fan. Well, some PlayStation 5 owners are experiencing a storage glitch which can corrupt game installs and even brick the entire console. That's what they deserve. - [Man] (laughs) - 'Cause they're not me. - [Man] Aww! - Neither of these issues seem widespread enough to cause a real crisis, not like Bendgate or something, with most fans reportedly... Wait, fans as in people? - [Man] Yes. - Okay, most people fans reportedly having a quote great time. But Nintendo meanwhile, isn't worried about its competitors. They've just released the Game & Watch: Super Mario Bros, a tiny clock that doubles as a handheld with three playable games. Super Mario Bros one and two, as well as a juggling game called Balls. - [Man] Sounds way better. - I'm keeping my voice like this. Oh, and the Switch sold 735,000 units in October, Sony and Microsoft, just so you know, making it the second-highest selling console ever for the month. For all Octobers. - All Octobers. - It's surpassed only by the sales of the Wii in 2008. And the Switch doesn't even support ray tracing. You know? - [Man] Throw it in the garbage. - A big fuss was made over AMD's Smart Access Memory Technology when they revealed it at the Radeon 6000 event last week. But now Nvidia says they're going to have their own version up and running soon. You guys, smart access memory, SAM, S-A-M, allows a Ryzen CPU direct access to a Radeon GPU's memory, which can improve performance. Some enthusiasts have pointed out that the feature was actually already included in the PCIe spec. So technically it wouldn't be that hard for Nvidia to implement similar tech. The GPU wars are only set to heat up from here, guys, with rumors pointing to Nvidia's unannounced RTX 3060, launching in January with 12 gigabytes of RAM. - [Man] Whoa! And images popping up of its sister card, the RTX 3060 Ti, hello! - [Man] Hey. - Sadly, none of them can run Spider-Man: Miles Morales. So really, what's the point? - [Man] Throw it in the garbage. - Well, they could run it but they don't, it's exclusive. - [Man] Well. - That's what you're saying, right? - [Man] No, it's on consoles. - Yeah, yeah, but like they could, they could handle it. - [Man] Well you can make it. - And gamers everywhere were glued to their screens any different way this morning, as a potential hostage situation unfolded at Ubisoft Montreal, yikes. Social media clips showed police surrounding the game studios headquarters and then helicopter footage emerged showing dozens of employees gathering on the roof, holding a rock concert. Just kidding. Having barricaded the door back into the building. But things weren't as dire as they seemed, as around 4:00PM Eastern, police had evacuated the building with all employees reported to be safe and accounted for. A police spokesperson said, \"No threat has been identified for now.\" It's unclear what exactly happened, maybe someone called in a fake threat, or there was a miscommunication, or it was just the last nice day before winter. But their confusion is understandable. We're all just a little on edge right now, you know. - [Man] Anything could happen. - Ah, Assassin's Creed have a bug, who knows? It is now time for the quick bits brought to you by Brilliant, the website and app that makes learning accessible and fun. Can you believe it kids? Fun. Instead of making you memorize facts. - [Man] Whoa. - Brilliant's approach is based on problem solving and active learning. - [Man] Yeah. - You'll encounter concepts visually, with courses laid out like bite-sized pieces of story that you can interact with. There's no tests or grades, just pick a course you are into and get started. Whether you wanna learn programming, or brush up on your algebra, or dive into the science of neural networks. The first 200 people, who head to Brilliant.org/TechLinked are gonna get, you guessed it, 20% off their annual premium subscription. So click the link below and get smart today. - [Man] Get smart. - Stop being dumb. How do you like dumb apples, dumb bum? - [Man] Dump apples. - Each quick bit that flutters off my tongue is a new height of ecstasy. I've been microdosing QuickVids all week. - [Man] Stop it. - After Google Photos locked some editing features behind it paywall, it's now revealed that next Summer, it will no longer offer free unlimited photo storage. If you want more than 15 gigabytes, you're gonna have to pay for cloud storage through Google One, whatever that is. Pixel phones are also getting a downgrade. Future Pixel devices won't get any special photos perks, but current Pixel owners will still enjoy unlimited high quality photos, which already was a downgrade. 'Cause they used to get unlimited... - [Man] That's true. - Yeah, you know, what were they called? - [Man] Original quality. - Original quality. PayPal is bringing its support for cryptocurrencies out of Beta. Now all PayPal users will have the ability to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies in the U.S. You can't use PayPal to buy anything, like product-wise with your cryptocurrency, but you'll know it's there. And that's half the fun of crypto anyway. Just something to have and to hold on. - [Man] Its just like Pokemon. - Apple isn't the only one to shift using its own proprietary processors. Perhaps because the M1s performance numbers are looking so great. Amazon has begun shifting away from using Nvidia's GPU's in some of its own servers, to using its Inferentia chips. And Google is still working on its own mobile chips for our future Pixel phones. And honestly, I'm thinking to make my own chips too. There's gonna be a ton of great DIY recipes online, they're gonna be like Doritos, except with green finger dust, because they're gonna be hemp-based, which is better for the environment, and you know the war on drugs is a failure. - [Man] Whoa, what's going on with you? - Oculus has already pushed out the 90 Hertz update that it promised to the Oculus Quest two, meaning that both standalone and desktop VR titles can use the higher refresh rate instead of the 72 Hertz, the headset was previously locked to. So you can send data to Facebook even faster than before while enjoying an admittedly pretty sick headset, if not for the Facebook thing. (both men groaning) - I'm against Facebook but I love Instagram, you know. And remember when TikTok potentially being banned was the biggest thing in the world? Yeah, apparently the Trump administration forgot too, because the app was supposed to have its reckoning this week. The deadline for determining its fate, has instead being extended by two weeks. At which point, I'm sure everything will be completely calmed down, and we can deal with it properly. - [Man] Back to normal. - You know, clear minds. - [Man] We'll be fine, two weeks. - It's time to clear your mind because this episode is over. Come back on Monday for more. It won't be me, I'll be at home with my baby, by myself. I call it babysitting even though it's my own kid.",

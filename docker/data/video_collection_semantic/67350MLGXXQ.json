    "transcript": "(clicking) (upbeat techno music) - Hey guys, how are you all doing? If you're new here, welcome. My name is Krazy Ken. And today, we're not taking our feet off the scam busting gas because I've received tons of messages about this very fishy advertising campaign for the StarScope Monocular telescope. It seems a little too good to be true, right? And I will say right off the bat, yeah, this is a scam. And today, we're gonna dive into why. So let's take a look at what this telescope claims to be. The most common ad I saw for the StarScope looks like this. A video which tells us the backstory of the product. They claim that it's only $69. In fact, it's actually cheaper than that. And it allows you to see everything from miles away. And the creation of this invention was made possible after an intensive research at Joe Hopkins University. Hang on, that can't be real, right? I mean, I know of John Hopkins University. Total B.S. And you know, my initial gut reaction was that's Oxford. Just from the architecture, that's what it looked like. So for grins and giggles, I double checked and sure enough, that is actually the New College Building at the University of Oxford. And that particular stock footage clip is available on Pond5.com from Brendan Riley. They also claim the StarScope allows you to see objects from miles away. What they show in their video is an unrealistic outcome from something like this. And we'll break down the technical reasons why in a moment. And they say it's like carrying a $4,000 DLSR in your pocket. Okay, first of all, no, it's not. And second, it's DSLR, not DLSR. Don't know where they got that from. DSLR stands for digital single-lens reflex. That's what this type of camera is. So it seems like they're making a lot of mistakes. And by the way, if you see mistakes like that and you see a lot of other grammatical errors and mispronunciations, that's usually a red flag. Maybe we'll call it a yellow flag. Just be careful around that stuff. Also, I absolutely love how they say it sells from a modest price point and they show a shot of a person shuffling $100 bills like they just hired the world's most expensive stripper. Not a good image. And they claim the possibilities are endless. Everything from birdwatching to observing stars in the sky. And they proceed to show an image of Saturn, which isn't a star. Now before we take a look at more of the stuff that these guys are spewing toward consumers, let's break down the video ad. Next I want to address the zoom test they show. They claim that the StarScope is capable of this extreme zooming functionality. But what you're seeing is actually a video from Platskoll on YouTube. And the advertisers merely stole it. The footage you're seeing is from a Nikon P900, a camera with a lens that has 83X optical zoom, equivalent to a 2000 millimeter focal length, which about eight times more than the 10X magnification in the first gen StarScope and about five times more than the 16X magnification in the second gen. By the way, special thanks to Bajiru_cs for making this discovery. Next point. Their ad shows different products in different scenes. In the opening shot, you see a monocular telescope with 16x52 magnification. But later, the product says 40x60. And the design looks different. Then in the ending title graphic, it says 10x50. More inconsistencies equals more red flags. And by the way, those numbers mean two things. The 10X, for example, is the magnification. And then the second number is the diameter of the lens. Next point. The screen simulations are presented poorly. In this shot, the user's hand is shaking, but the image on the screen doesn't shake. If this were a real demonstration of the product, the bird would be shifting and shaking in the frame while the user's hand moved. And there's no disclaimer that this is a screen simulation. They also try to show this quick zooming motion onto the bird subject. But when you observe the video frame by frame, you'll notice a cut before the bird shows up. It's merely two videos spliced together. And if I had to guess, none of these videos But it doesn't stop there. Now let's take a look at their website. Their website claims StarScope has zooming capabilities, not just a single fixed magnification. But the problem with that is you never see a zooming mechanism on the StarScope. What I mean by that is, take a look at a traditional camera lens. When you zoom, you may see something like this happen. The higher the focal length, the more zoomed in you are. And it's usually done by twisting a ring. But on the StarScope, we don't see any of those types of mechanisms taking place. Where are they? No idea, but you see plenty of footage of people zooming in on a subject. It's probably a bunch of B.S. My theory is they're just using camera lenses on real cameras and they're passing off that footage as StarScope footage. Also, I've discovered articles, which in this case are just ads in disguise, that show more comparisons between the StarScope and a $5,000 DSLR. Oddly enough, the article is inconsistent with the product name, sometimes calling it Cosmic Scope. Here's another comparison they show, which makes absolutely no sense. For starters, the photos aren't even taken in the same location or at the same time of day. But let's make pretend that they were taken at the same location and at the same time of day. What are they trying to prove with this comparison? That the StarScope can produce better dynamic range and you can see details in the sky better than the DSLR? Wrong, lenses have little to no effect on dynamic range. Dynamic range is affected by the camera sensor, not the optics. And since the StarScope isn't actually a camera and it doesn't have a camera sensor, why are they even bothering with this comparison? Makes no sense, they're just trying to fool you. Their site is also riddled with fake scarcity discounts, which never actually expire. And there's reviews too, which are likely fake because the website tries to format them into a live looking Facebook style interface, but none of the like or reply buttons actually do anything. And the dates never change. But oddly enough, the profile pictures change. And the new people look nothing like the previous people, yet their names stay the same. Why even do that? I have no fricking idea. They just made it 10 times more obvious that this stuff is fake. Now before we continue, I do want to say I am making hypotheses here. When I'm critiquing the hardware features and all the optical functionality of this product, it's all hypotheses because I haven't tested the physical product yet. But I still think I can make some educated guesses here. So with all of this evidence, it's pretty clear that this stuff is shady and scammy, right? But now I need to put my hypotheses to the test and actually try the product. So, I went ahead and bought one. At least I thought I did. The purchase process was riddled with fake countdown timers and annoying post-transaction upsells. But that crap aside, I was actually able to use Apple Pay and complete my purchase. And I was given a confirmation number. But the weird thing is, I never received an email receipt. So I waited for a day, and nothing. Still nothing. Now, I'll be honest. I kind of got distracted because I was working on other episodes and I kind of forgot to check for confirmation. But then I remembered like maybe, I don't know, two weeks later or so, and still nothing. So I gave them a call. To their credit, the customer support was super friendly. But what I found out was the transaction was aborted. - [Man On Phone] (murmuring) shows that the transaction for the order and also for the payment has been aborted and canceled. - That has never happened on this show before. So at this point, I'm super confused because the website said the order was received and I even got a confirmation number. But sure enough, I checked my bank and no transaction took place. But the company still had my phone, email, and name. So some information went through. So to make up the time, I decided to buy the product elsewhere. But sadly, loyal viewers, I regret to inform you that this product is not available on Amazon. (melancholy music) Oh, wait, here it is. Well, let's go ahead and order it with Amazon's new portal shipping, and it should be here soon. (smashing) Wow, that's convenient. Full disclosure, guys. I accidentally bought the first-generation StarScope, not the G2, which I guess apparently is the one that's on the website when you actually go to purchase it. But there's three different models in the video, so it's really confusing. Either way, the design looks the same. The only difference I could find is that the G2 has 16X magnification and this has 10. So, sorry, slight difference, but I think given the circumstances, we can ignore that little variable. Okay, now let's go ahead and test this bad boy out. (duck quacking) Okay, so my tests are done and I value your time so I'm not gonna show you every single thing that I did. But in short, all of my predictions were correct. The first gen StarScope does in fact have 10X magnification. So that feature is properly advertised in certain parts of their marketing material. But remember, this is not a full frame lens. You will constantly experience this iris effect in all of your photos. But to be fair, they demonstrate that in their ads. So at least they're being honest here. But regardless, you won't be able to achieve the same optical quality that a true photography lens can reproduce. You also can't magically stabilize your footage, and there's no variable zoom capabilities. Another inconsistency I noticed is my particular StarScope says 40x60. The StarScope website says 10x50. And the Amazon listing also says 10x50. So I'm not sure why these numbers don't line up. But from the measurements I looked at, this is definitely not 40X magnification. It only looks like 10. And the diameter of the objective lens is not 60 millimeters. So if you want to get one, go for it. Just make sure your expectations are in sync. Because the big problem with this whole thing is not the product itself, it's the false advertising. StarScope oversells this thing. They make false promises. They push false advertising. They post fake reviews. And they value this thing at a ridiculous $80. But on the bright side, thanks to this, I can now see bull (beeping) from three miles away.

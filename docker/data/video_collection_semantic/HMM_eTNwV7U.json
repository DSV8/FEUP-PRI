    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and today I am taking you guys on a really fun adventure. Right now I'm at a hotel outside of San Diego, but we are going to be heading into the city and we're gonna go and do some really fun adventures. And my sister is inside the hotel room right now and she doesn't know it, but I have a little surprise for her. A huge thank you to Metro by T-Mobile for sponsoring this video. In the last video that I did with Metro by T-Mobile, Jenna mentioned that she wanted one of the phones that I had. Well now Metro has a new plan that they're running. You get two Samsung Galaxy A20's, unlimited data, Amazon Prime, all for $80 when you switch. And since the new A20 just recently came out I got one for Jenna. So I am going to surprise her with that. And since we're always traveling and doing road trips and constantly in need of the internet, I got us one of the Metro Smart Hotspots. And we're constantly uploading videos in the car so we will definitely be using this today and in the future. Jenna! - Yo! - So what are we going to do today? - Uh, breakfast and then adventure. - Okay. I am so excited. It's so nice outside today too. We should probably go to Torrey Pines, it's a really cute state park that they have close by. And then maybe the Zoo. - [Gasps] I've always wanted to go to the Zoo but no one ever wanted to go with me. - I'm sorry, I'll take you. I also have a surprise for you but let's go to breakfast first. - For, For me?! - [Justine] For you! - It's like a day of Jenna! - Jenna appreciation day. That is usually in February, but it's happening a little late this year. (door opening) (relaxed music) So before we head out on our adventures we have to have some breakfast first. And this place has the best breakfast ever. This is our buffet, like I got everything. I am so zoomed in right now I can see, I can see where this egg came from. I can see the hen. (bright music) We just finished breakfast and we're about to head out on some adventures, but I have a surprise for you Jenna. - For me?! - For you! - I thought my surprise was breakfast. Should I close my eyes? - Maybe. - Okay, okay they're closed. - So in the last video, Jenna said that she wanted a phone as well. You're supposed to keep your eyes closed. - Gift? A gift for me? - A gift for you. - Oh my goodness. - This is the new Samsung Galaxy A20 that just recently came out. Metro's latest deal is two Samsung Galaxy A20s, unlimited data, Amazon Prime. All for $80 when you switch. - Really? - I know. - That's an incredible deal! Can I unbox it now? - Yeah, go for it. There's also another little surprise. This one is for both of us. Peel off that sticker. - [Jenna] Ready? - [Justine] Tada! Oh it looks so good. - [Jenna] Oh it is so fresh, and so smudge free and I've smudged it. - I already have it all activated for you, so we are set for the rest of the day. So this is their smart hotspot. You just turn it on, it makes a Wi-Fi hotspot and you can connect to it. - That's good, cause guess what? I have a lot of work to do in the car. - So do I. - That's great. Our new office, our car. - I mean honestly we end up sitting in our car so much working, on like the side of the road. - That's true, very true. - [Both] Thank you. - Is your phone set up? - Yeah! - Okay! - I'm all set up. - So I should probably download the trail map first. 'Cause I'm not really sure where we are going to be going. (slow electronic music) - I think we're finally ready. - All right I'm looking at my trail map so we can figure out where to go because sometimes they don't tell you where the start of the trail is. - There's a bunch of different trails too because there's like a beach access, there's a north beach. (music builds) - [Justine] Show them what you are doing right now - [Jenna] I can't. - [Justine] Jenna has a phone and a laptop and you gotta get the hotspot out. - I'm trying, but like, I know I do need the hotspot because I have to upload. - [Jenna] And you're vlogging for me. - I'm trying to vlog, I'm trying to get us there. Eleven yellow minutes. Everything is sliding out of control. (music builds) - [Jenna] Hotspot is up. - [Justine] I texted her the password. - We're in, we're in, we're in, we're in. Yes, yes yes, we're connected. - So I think what we should do is just leave the computer open, connected to the hotspot while we hike. - We're on top of this mountain. - We are, well I also have to upload a video, I think it's on that drive, so you can upload that. - [Jenna] Yeah, I'm on it. - I'm gonna take a look and see what's outside. I'm going to compare this map. (upbeat electronic music) - There's a High Point Trail, there's the Razor Point trail. This is 2/3 of a mile, this is the 1/2 mile loop. What do you want? Which one do you want? - [Jenna] Let's just walk. - Okay. I just want us to have a nice walk. - [Jenna] We will. - Okay, we will. (upbeat music) - We just saw a small little bird's nest and a pack rat's nest. I've never seen one before. The pack rat, actually the males are not allowed inside of the pack rat nest because they eat the babies. - [Jenna] But they stay close by. - I wanna get a picture of it real quick. I mean that whole thing is it. Hello, Instagram. I just want to let you know that this here is a pack rat's nest. Thank you so much for coming to Justine's nature walk. I'll see you next time. Good content, good content. (electronic music playing) I've already taken so many photos and videos since we got here. One of the things that is great is, you do have a Google One subscription included in your Metro plan. All of my photos and videos are automatically backed up to Google One. (upbeat music) - Lovely little hike. I need to look what a pack rat looks like. I don't know what a pack rat looks like, do you? - [Jenna] No, I have no- No, I was trying to play it cool but I don't actually know. - I don't either. - Oh my gosh. Oh no, pack rats for dinner. - [Jenna] Oh no. - They're little. She made a mansion out there. - [Jenna] Do you think they will have them at the zoo? - Pack rats? - [Jenna] Do you think there will be meerkats at the zoo? - I mean, I don't know. I don't know, let's go. (slow electronic music) Can you guys believe that we are at the zoo right now? Like we made it here. We are here officially, Jenna's first time at the zoo. (Jenna celebrating) (slow electronic music) - [Jenna] Oh wait, do that again. - We need to reenact something for you, okay. - [Jenna] It's real, a real authentic reaction. - I was walking, okay. Jenna said- - [Jenna] I go \"Java\" - That was the reenactment. But there really is Java over there. Should we get one now? Do we get them now? Jungle Java, it's called Jungle Java. - [Jenna] Do you think it's like ice blended? (yelping) - [Justine] Okay which straw should we get? I want the giraffe. I may have made a mistake. - There ya go, oh my gosh. - This is so good. Now that we have got a coffee taken some selfies, really making use of my unlimited data. (upbeat electronic music) There's a big jolt coming. - [Jenna] What do you mean? Did you know about that? - Yeah because I saw the people in front of me. (yelping) - Jolted! (relaxed electronic music) - Ah, God, that's super aggressive. It moved, the ear moved. Oh my gosh it has arisen. - [Jenna] Arisen? That's what I look like when I wake up from a nap. Licking my lips, looking for candy. You can get a custom henna starting at $25. - Should we get our face painted? - Or a henna tattoo. - I think that I want the flamingo swirl. If you get the full on cheetah, I'll give you a new Samsung Galaxy A20. - I already have it. - Shoot, Shoot! I will let you have unlimited- you already have unlimited data, okay. How much, what would you do? What would you do for it? - For full on cheetah face paint? - Yes. - A thousand dollars - A thousand doll- get out of here. I'm getting a Flamingo Swirl. Let me have this. - I'll get a henna tattoo - [Justine] Okay. - [Jenna] Okay so I'm either going to do this skull, or the shark. - [Justine] Okay, I can't see it so you're going to have to send it to me. - [Jenna] Are you nervous Justine, are you excited? - Oh my gosh, I keep thinking it's going to hurt. - [Jenna] No. - No. - [Jenna] It's kind of (mumble) For children. How's it going Jus? - Good, I just found out that this lasts for two weeks. Jenna told me it lasts for two days. I got my Metro by T-Mobile henna tattoo. Fun Fact it actually lasts for two weeks, not two days. - [Jenna] I only read 24-48 hours, I should- this is another life lesson to read the instructions. - Where do I go know? - [Artist] And then I'm just going to turn you around real quick. Let's see it first, let's see it, give a little look. Whoa! - How long does it take to dry? - [Artist] About an hour so just be careful. - [Jenna] Here we go, now she is getting a Flamingo Swirl. You're going to be beautiful. Oop, there you go, you're done. - No I'm not, really? - [Jenna] Here wanna see? Let's see it! - Hello, I'm beautiful. - [Jenna] It looks good. - Thank you, this is so cool - [Jenna] It's very cute. - [Artist] I'm glad I got the text pretty good - Yeah, it's great! Now it's Jenna's turn. - Yay! - [Justine] Oh this looks so cool Jen - I'm not going to look until it's done. I couldn't get it on my neck because I move too much. - We've been at the zoo for about three hours. We've have got a coffee. - [Jenna] What?! - What time did we get here? It feels like three hours, it feels like a long time. We still haven't seen an animal yet, but we've got tattoos, I got face paint, I had a coffee. - [Jenna] Where are the animals? - I think that she said that the elephants are over here. - [Jenna] Elephant Odyssey. - I think the elephants went to the vet she said. Are they- This is a bear. - [Jenna] What am I looking at? - [Justine] Where are we? - Wait, what?! - [Justine] Ooohh, Wow. 7 to 10, that's a big spray. Do you think it's their potty? - That would be incredible. - So cancel everything I said Jenna, the elephants are here. - [Justine] Look at that butt. - [Jenna] Oh, turn around. - [Justine] Oh he's turning around. - [Jenna] He's dusting up the place. - [Justine] I'm shooting in regular mode. He's moving so slow this looks like slow motion. He's eatin', He's eatin'. - [Justine] Oh I forgot I had facepaint on, wow. - [Jenna] He's coming in for the shot. - Look at his eyelash, look at how long it is. Come on, let's go in the photo booth. - We've done so many non-animal things here. - [Jenna] It's smelly in here. - [Justine] We'll do meerkats for Jenna. - [Jenna] Oh my gosh meerkats, oh they're- (squeals) (machine counting down) - I was a meerkat - Uh, me too. - Okay, that was not us being meerkats - [Justine] It wasn't. - [Jenna] Oh there we go, oh boy. - Gosh the zoo is so much fun. Oh look at this quality! - [Jenna] Can we put it on your refrigerator? We should get a, a- - Magnet! - Yes! - How's my tat looking? - [Jenna] Looks good, it's crumbling which means that its setting. - That's good. - [Jenna] I think that's what she said. Well once again I didn't read the instructions. - We gotta read the instructions. - [Justine] No it's real, he's looking out - [Jenna] Oh he's eating. - [Justine] He's, is he eating? - [Jenna] Or sleeping? - [Justine] No he's looking out. - [Jenna] Well lets go look back. (birds chirping) - [Justine] Oh look at him. - [Jenna] He wasn't- he was looking in. - [Justine] He was kind of looking. - [Jenna] His little beard, oh my gosh. - [Justine] He is really cute. - So Jenna's been using her Samsung Galaxy A20 and I've been using the Samsung Galaxy S10 plus. I've actually had this phone for quite a while and I absolutely love it. And one of the cool things about Metro is not only do they have access to top phones, you are actually able to save a lot of money on your Metro plans. We just made our way around the entire zoo, and we made it back to the beginning where we started, which was where the flamingos were and now I am one of them. I don't think they understand. - [Jenna] They are so cute. - They are so cool - [Jenna] Look at their little bodies (birds honking) - Do you remember when I got face paint and a fake tattoo? - [Jenna] Yes, big day. - [Justine] Is he dying? - [Jenna] They're all doing it. - [Justine] Oh. - [Jenna] Are they possessed? That's just so strange. Maybe that's how they eat. - I have questions, I have so many flamingo questions. - (sigh) We just got back to the hotel room. I am exhausted. We had a full day of activities. And Jenna's over there watching some shows on her phone. And one of the things that we do quite often is we share hotel rooms and before she had a phone or would watch stuff on her computer, she would watch stuff on TV before bed. And it would be so loud it would actually- - It would not be that loud, it was definitely very bright. - It was pretty loud. With Metro you get an Amazon Prime account and I honestly can not live without Amazon. Shopping and shows, I don't know, what more could you want? - Well I want you to stop talking so I can watch my show. - Don't make me come over there. I would if I wasn't- - You would not. - I would not, because I am already in my bed. Well thank you guys so much for watching. We had so much fun in San Diego. And a huge thank you to Metro again for sponsoring this video. It was really fun seeing what other Metro options they have out there especially that hotspot. I look forward to our next adventure but for now time to go to sleep. Okay but now here is the real question, who is going to get up and turn off the light? - [Jenna] Noooo! - Come on you, okay, rock paper scissors. 1,2,3 shoot. 1,2,3 shoot. Did I cut you? - I also cut you. - Oh my gosh, I can't see that far. - One more, one more - Okay ready, 1,2,3 shoot. - I win - What did you do? - Paper. You know what- suffocate you like I'm suffocating in this room. It is so hot. - We were really cold, so I turned the heat on. It's on like 85. - Oh my gosh! - You're fine. Okay, good night. - Bye guys, thanks for watching. (electronic music)",

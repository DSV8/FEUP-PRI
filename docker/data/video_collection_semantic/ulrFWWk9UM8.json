    "transcript": "- Hey! How's it going? Dave2D here. I hope I'm in the frame. I can't even see the screen of this phone. Obviously, I'm not filming in my office, this is just at home. I want to shoot something just during the holiday break. Thank you so much for a million subscribers, I appreciate it so much like, I can't... Thank you, all the new people that subscribed, the original people... People that like, watch me out of love, the people that hate watching me, It doesn't even matter, I appreciate every single one of you guys. When you start YouTube, At least for me, You don't really think of a goal of like, A million subscribers is not one of the goals that I personally had It was just not even in the radar and then, over the course of this year, Like, it's just- it happened, and it's just... Thank you so much! I really appreciate it. I thought I'd just make a little like montage of stuff that I've experienced over the past three years, I got to experience because of you guys... Okay. - My name is Dave2D. - This is Dave2D. - This is Dave2D. - This is the worst idea ever... [Lewis] - First of all, you need to take it down a notch because you're... [Dave] - Because I'm too loud? [Lewis] - I mean you're scaring people in this video... - Oh my ****! This is so heavy! - I know it seems kind of silly to make a thank you video after 150 subs, but seriously, I never thought this channel would've meant to anything, I didn't think I'd have any subs. I just did this for fun, So it's super cool to have people on board that are interested in the stuff I'm making. - I'm about to hit 2,000 subs, or maybe by the time this thing gets published, I will be over 2,000, but that is- that is just awesome to me, I mean to me, that means that 2,000 people actually care about the videos I am putting out. - I can't even express in words just how... appreciative I am for the support that you guys have given me over the past ten months because, it takes I mean, I put a lot of effort into these videos, a lot. I mean, some of these videos take like 15, sometimes 20 hours to bang one out and like, I do it because I really give a sh*t about these videos. I spend way too much time on them. My wife thinks I'm crazy, and my friends think I'm nuts. My work suffers heavily because of this YouTube channel But I do it because you guys are awesome. The community that we've built over the past 10 months is just like phenomenal. - You guys has basically turned a channel that had zero subscribers last year, in January of 2015 I had zero subscribers, into something that is such a big part of my life now and like, You guys are to thank for it. Thank you so much. We've made this community that's just awesome and every time I get to make a video and share it with you guys It's just, it's the best thing in the world. Thanks a lot. - So yeah, if you like my video, like it. If you want to sub, sub! Now, I know you're thinking, you know... \"Dave2D, you have one video, and I've already seen it, so why am I subbing?\" So... You know how sometimes you hear about that guy who bought apple stock at like, 10 bucks. Now you can be that guy.",

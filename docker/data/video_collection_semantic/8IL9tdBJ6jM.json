    "transcript": "This here is a viewer's very very dirty gaming pc now admittedly at first glance you might be thinking well greg this isn't as bad as some of the some of the builds that you've cleaned in this season uh well let me go ahead and just show you a power supply dust filter um it's freaking gross now the owner of the system eduardo told me that there are a few obvious concerns with this build that should be addressed first off the m.2 drive is not being held down by anything you couldn't find a screw i do have several on hand so we'll lock that down for him also there are mismatched fans pretty much everywhere especially up front one of them died apparently that he was using before so he threw in what he had remaining and it looks yeah a bit weird not to worry though because we'll be upgrading this case outright with something much better from our product sponsor in this video be quiet we'll be using their purebase 500dx which i'm sure you've seen before in this playlist but it is a really great mid tower i'm a huge fan of that form factor and the 500dx has great airflow properties it has integrated rgb and it comes with three 140ml purewings two fans but more on that in a bit we gotta clean this system first and i imagine it's going to take a while stay with me to get rid of that annoying activation watermark hop on over to vip std key and purchase a windows 10 pro oem key for fractions of the price of retail just use a secure payment method like paypal receive your key in seconds and activate your os here bye bye watermark and be sure to use our new offer code skgs for a sweet discount now i want to make it a habit from here on out in this playlist to mention important specifications up front prior to cleaning many of you have been asking for these details in the comments so let's go ahead and give them to you now in this case he's got a ryzen 5 1600 in here so just plain old zen right no zen plus zen two or zen three just the og ryzen 5 1600 still a great cpu six cores 12 threads we also have a gtx 1080 ti in here from zotac this is an extremely compact 1080 ti you can see though that it's boasting two supplemental eight pins it's an indication that this card is not just a vanilla gtx 1060 or gtx 1070. i'm i'm not sure if it's because of the dust that i dislodged bringing the system in here or not just start coughing all of a sudden there is a lot of dust here i know maybe from your vantage point doesn't seem as though there's a lot of dust in this build but especially at the rear you can see how much of it is caked up these pcie slot covers not sure air can even pass through these unhindered god knows what the power supply looks like or the graphics card for that matter and these fans these fans are hideous now i will make it a point to clean the case even though we won't be reusing it i still want to see that transformation and the s340 the ogs 340 here is still i mean it's still a cool looking case you know it's a bit dated by this point in 2021 but i still want to deflate so see all of that in this video and uh yeah i guess we should just get to it this is pcdc after all let's get to deep cleaning here we go bye oh my oh so oh oh foreign oh foreign time foreign oh well here we are everything has been thoroughly cleaned with the exception again the power supply and i've talked about why i don't deep clean those in previous episodes i made an exception in episode four only because that power supply was oh that was really really bad and i wanted to reuse it nonetheless we have the nzxt s340 here out on the table deconstructed thoroughly cleaned we won't be reusing it though we'll be replacing it with a much better case in pretty much every category that being the be quiet purebase 500dx which we'll introduce here in a second so let's get this thing reassembled and then we'll reassemble the clean components into the new case do now this here is the be quiet purebase 500dx and again if you've been watching this series for quite a while you've probably seen this case pop up a few times at least i really like it is one of my favorite mid towers and that's why i asked be quiet to be the product sponsor for this playlist or for at least the remainder of this season this case is again it's just one of those that you really can't go wrong with it doesn't cost a lot of money relatively speaking what you're getting for around a hundred dollars or so is pretty insane you get a full on mesh front panel you get 140 millimeter pure wings two fans three of those to be exact and uh yeah you get a sleek looking tower at that now another thing eduardo's old case didn't have was integrated rgb now i know that's a bit polarizing in 2021 but it sells and it looks really good the way that be quiet implemented it here just running down the center between both sides of this mesh front panel and you're gonna have plenty of cable management space back here we're talking about an inch worth of space behind the motherboard tray and that is plenty so with that let's get these components right on into here um foreign hey so all right and now we are just checking for a post want to make sure that all of his drives are connected now he does have like four drives in this system so make sure all those are detected and the uh and the bios we'll get a post here hopefully we'll be able to see those drives listed if not we'll hop into the bios and confirm that everything looks to be running smoothly so far no clipping fans or anything especially on the graphics card i want to make sure we don't have that issue just waiting on a picture here nice there we go that's what i like to see all right and it looks like it is trying to boot yup into windows now so i did hop into the bios and confirm that the drives are detected so we connected those properly via sata and i'm assuming that the m.2 drive is what houses his operating system which we've put it into here so everything works that's really great i might i don't know maybe play around with the rgb a bit i can kind of tweak that in the purebase 500 dx here not sure what color scheme he'll be going for i might just leave it on white for now and then he can tweak it from there so that's about it for this one folks um yeah i'm i'm really pleased with how this turned out we were able to clean up his entire system and especially seeing as though he has a gtx 1080 ti in here we want to take good care of it in this market these cards are worth way more now than they pretty much ever have been and uh so you want to practice good hygiene so to speak with your pc components especially those that are so difficult to come by for a decent price he told me that he bought this right before everything went crazy i think somebody sold it because they thought they were going to be able to buy ampy or fairly easy um that didn't age well ultimately i hope you enjoyed watching this pc being deep cleaned it is such a satisfying process to be the cleaner i did this all actually in just over one day i actually um took everything apart the night prior to filming this scene here and everything that you saw in the time lapse was done in one day usually takes me about two or three days but i i just worked straight on through to get this one done today and i'm really glad that uh that it looks the way that it does it it's rewarding it kind of pays for itself just being able to see the before and after with that if you guys want to leave a comment i would appreciate that in the comment section below i'll be looking for those especially earlier on when the video is published if you have not subscribed yet i don't know what the heck you're doing click that red subscribe button come on fellas and give this video a like yeah if you thought it was cool that would be appreciated as well you can find all my cleaning gear that i use in this video down in the video description along with some of my troubleshooting gear that we use in the fix or flop playlist speaking of which next weekend a fixer flop video is on deck that's all for this one my name is greg thanks for cleaning with me",

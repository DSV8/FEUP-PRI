    "transcript": "- Did you know that TechLinked's tech news is naturally derived from 100% electronic tech sources? That's why it feels so smooth goin' down. - [Riley] Ew. - All the way down. - [Riley] No! - [James] After leaks revealed the design and price of the lower-power Xbox Series S and the Series X, Microsoft decided to go with the flow and make the reveal official. Phil Spencer said they're gonna tell everybody next week, he swears. But he's got a kind of suspicious face, you know? And very punchable. Not sure if we can trust him. - [Riley] Tee-hee! - Anyways, both consoles launch on November 10th, with preorders opening on September 22nd, just three days before my birthday. An Xbox Series S will cost us just $299, and physically it takes up less than half the volume of the Series X, which will cost $499. - [Riley] Whoo. The bets are settled. It's over. - [Riley] Nice. - [James] That's partly because the Series S lacks a disc drive, but it also has weaker specs across the board: a less powerful GPU, a slightly lower-clocked CPU as well as less VRAM and less storage. But Microsoft says it will still be capable of delivering 1440p gameplay at 120 FPS- - [Riley] Whoo! - [James] For 299. - [Riley] Wow! - Dang? Dang. But the deal actually just gets better! EA's game subscription, EA Play, has just been plonked into Xbox Game Pass for free, while Xbox All Access, basically a hardware payment plan that comes with Games Pass and Xbox Live, will now allow users to upgrade to the new consoles. - [Riley] Whoo, man. - And as Ars Technica points out, you might even save money going that route instead of just buying the console and games passes separately outright. Really, the only bad part of today's Xbox news is a leak showing a 1-terabyte expansion SSD retailing for $220, I mean... Dang, Philly. (laughs) We trusted you. Google has rolled out Android 11 to Pixel phones. I didn't notice. What? - You didn't update it. - Oh. Other phones have it too though? - [Riley] Yeah! - OnePlus, Xiaomi, OPPO and Realme devices can also update to Android 11 if they're paying attention, unlike me, although it's just a stable beta version. But that's still... That's better than just Pixels, right? (chuckles) Take that, Apple. I don't get it. Anyways, Android 11 brings built-in screen recording, system-level messaging bubbles, revamped media controls built into the notification shade, group notifications and a few other privacy and security tweaks. Google has normally revealed a new statue in Mountain View for each Android release, but this time they just made an AR statue that you can see through your phone. You know, keep your physical distance from those statues. - [Riley] Yeah, go with it though. - It says (sputters) Apple would make a real statue, but I don't know, their announcement for their event was also AR. - [Riley] Apple would do it! - I don't think they would. Something Apple might do though, apparently, is remove the ability for users to log into their Epic Games accounts using the \"Sign In with Apple\" method. I don't know what Apple thought this would accomplish. Like, would this be the final straw that makes Epic go, \"Oh, okay, fine. Lawsuit's off.\" (Riley laughs) - [Riley] Oh, shoot! The sign-in? Not the sign-in! - It's the drop that makes the glass run over. Users shouldn't be affected as long as they make sure their email and password are up to date so they can sign in the old-fashioned way. This latest petty move in the legal fight between the two companies comes after Apple countersued Epic for damages suffered from the loss of \"Fortnite\" revenue, with Apple calling Epic's actions, \"Theft, period.\" Even if Apple is legally correct here, it feels a bit weird to say that Epic stole the money generated from their game from Apple, and isn't this how this all started? - [Riley] Yep. - So stupid. Whatever, now it's time for the Quick Bits, brought to you by Brilliant. If you're a student, a professional or just someone who wants to make the brain good, check out Brilliant, the website that helps you reach your learning goals by working just a little bit every day. The courses use interactive explorations and a mobile app to take complex concepts and break them up into delicious bites, James, bite-sized, James-size chunks. We suggest checking out their Mathematical Fundamentals course, which has been redesigned with interactive features to help you with the foundational concepts behind algebra, number theory and logic, very logical. It makes it a great resource for STEM students. The first 200 of those people, STEM students or not, need to head to Brilliant.org/TechLinked, and they'll get 20% off an annual premium subscription. I got by Quick Bits and my flippy-floppies - [Riley] Whoa! Where are you? - I don't know. Western Digital apparently has this weird habit of doing stupid things, because after just getting over that whole shingled magnetic recording debacle, the company has now started labeling 7200 RPM drives as 5400 RPM drives meant for servers and NAS systems. This means the drivers are louder, hotter and consume more power than owners expect. Apparently WD are calling the drives 5400 RPM-class units. Cool. Gonna start saying I'm a seven-foot-class dude. You're all so tiny down there. Ask me how the weather is. Inside sources are claiming that Microsoft is readying a new midrange Surface device to launch this fall for around 500 U.S. dollars. That would be pretty amazing if it didn't also have only 64 gigabytes of storage and 4 gigabytes of RAM. - [Riley] Come on! - Are you kidding me, man? It's 2020, Microsoft. Making a laptop with 4 gigabytes of RAM is like making a car that has legs instead of wheels, and tiny little short legs that aren't even seven-foot-class. - [Riley] Oh, that's pointless! - Wait, did they just invent the horse? More rumors are pointing to an upgraded, 4K-capable Nintendo Switch launching next year, 2021. A Bloomberg report covering Nintendo increasing Switch production to meet demand also claims that the company has told third-party developers to prepare 4K-ready versions of their games. Yes! Can't wait to see Mario's pores. His little, greasy plumber pores. We've already proved he has nipples. This is the next frontier. Mario's blackheads. (Riley laughs) \"PUBG Mobile\" may have found a way to remain in India after being banned from the country along with over 100 other Chinese apps, including Tik Tok. The game is actually produced by the South Korean PUBG Corp, which will now publish the game itself in India instead of Tencent. Tencent's not a place, the company's gonna publish it instead of Tencent's publishing it, you see what I'm saying here. I'll see you back on the battlefield, soldier. Or I'll see bots. It'll probably be bots. - [Riley] Welcome back. - The easiest level. And Razer has unleashed their most powerful gaming accessory yet. The company partnered with 5 Gum to launch Respawn, which promises to help gamers maintain focus and reaction time while gaming thanks to green tea extract, B vitamins, and synthetic rage. - [Riley] What? Whoa! - And the power of chewing! (Riley laughs) Not those last two. Thank you for imbibing today's tech news with us. Come back on Friday for more of the good stuff. Oh yeah, it's good. - [Riley] Aw, you coulda done that better. - I need gum. (Riley laughs)",

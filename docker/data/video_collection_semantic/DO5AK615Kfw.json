    "transcript": "so this is going to be the hardest video I've ever had to make because I've been living a lie I've just not been honest with you and myself which has led me to be in a in a dark place it's so hard you know when you're YouTuber everybody thinks you you just you've got your Tech stuff together that you can do Tech that you can do Tech things better than other people but the truth [Music] is I I don't have I don't have any network access storage I've just been using a pile of loose hard drives for years like some kind of animal so today we need to fix that [Music] now not only do I not have a Nas but my storage configuration is wildly Savage it's the kind of thing that would make lonus cry now basically what I've been doing for the last Millennia is buy these 8 tbte hard drives and then fill them up until they're done and then just add them to this pile uh but don't worry I have a system here I've marked them with sharpies so I know that this is the second Drive I bought this is the first drive I bought so I can kind of figure out how old the data is on it by the Sharpie number and at this point I think I'm at Drive nine uh where is the most recent one oh so this is the most recent one which I can tell because I haven't marked it with a sharpie yet and it's a 12 tbte Drive ooh fancy now the way in which I put data on these hard drives and get it off is by using this toaster thing which is like an external hard drive caddy the you just drop the hard drive in and then there's also the issue of storing the hard drives cuz I've just kind of kept them here on the side of a sit stand desk which you know I I raise and lower semi-regularly which does present its own problem and here is evidence of said problem I wish I could say that I've only had one of these drives fall off the desk once but it's happened several times although it's okay because they're not running right so the data on them has survived every fall see it's it's not that high and aside from the fact that this is just the storage solution of an animal I'm also desperately in need of more space because I've got like one video worth of space left on the last hard drive and this isn't even a hard drive that I bought specifically for the use case I just found it in a pile and I'm I I just can't bear adding another hard drive to this pile and then the final issue is because of how long I've been putting this off I need a huge amount of space and a huge amount of space is very expensive like really expensive it's one of the reasons it's taken me so long to get around to this because every time I calculate how much space I need I just start weeping for days at a time over the expense I'm going to have to incur for this and because of how many huge hard drives I need I just couldn't get anybody to send me any drives o i put that down way too hard in fact this may actually be the most expensive video I've ever made but luckily I got a lot of help from the patreons because of generous monthly support from many individuals I managed to buy $5,000 worth of hard drives which actually doesn't buy as many hard drives as you'd expect I even had to buy the hard drives in two batches from separate detailers because they just didn't have enough stock oh and the hard drives in question are eight of these 22 terabyte ironwolf Pro drives now unfortunately that doesn't mean I'm going to get hold on um 176 terab of storage because I want some fail safe built into my Nas but we'll get into what storage configuration I'm going to use a bit later so thank you so much to everybody that supported the channel on patreon up until this point that makes an absurd video like this even possible without me having to mortgage several of my children and file for chapter 5 bankrupts is that a type of bankruptcy I don't I don't know but anyway with that let's get the rest of the components for the nas that I'm going to build and get started in terms of platform I've decided to go with am4 because am4 has ECC support which apparently according to people on Reddit is very important for a Nas now I could have gone with an older Intel xon platform like a lot of people do for nases but I wanted to give a consumer Hardware AMD NASA try but I also went one step further and got this specific azrock motherboard because it also has specific listed ECC support on ack's website that is almost the entire reason why I went with this motherboard oh and it's m8x so it fits in our case CPU wise I'm going to use ayzen 5 5500 which in terms of CPU power is quite overkill for an ass you know a little bit of head room is never bad I also got one of these an HBA card so that I can plug all of these hard drives into this motherboard casewise I'm going with this fractal design node 804 because it's a relatively compact case that supports eight hard drives which again is why I have eight hard drives now in a very uncharacteristic for me fashion let's assemble this system outside of the case first to see that it's working [Music] now one of the reasons that I also wanted matx was so that I have some expandability options on this motherboard which makes its weird 2.5 GB chipset less of a problem cuz if I need 10 GB ethernet later down the line I can just drop it in one of these slots I will say it does feel a bit weird using a motherboard that looks like this for a assas but why not have some gamer bling you know now because of our 5500 this isn't going to be a hyper efficient Nas in terms of power draw but this is quite an efficient chip and it's potentially not going to be doing a whole lot wo that was so lucky I'm also going to use the stock cooler although if it gets a bit noisy I can swap this out later in future if I need to now I didn't go with a ryzen Apu for this build because apparently that does introduce some compatibility issues with ECC RAM and yeah I didn't want to introduce any more compatibility issues power supply wise I'm going to use this again massive Overkill 850 wat fsp unit which fsp sent over for a video ages ago I haven't gotten around to using it yet so I'm going to use it in this system because this is going to be a reliable power supply I'm not going to use near to its 850 W but yeah just good power supply oh never mind I'm not going to use it it's an sfx power supply I don't know I don't know how I'm missed that detail let me let me go find another one okay well I guess I'll use this RM 750e instead now before we fire this up I'm going to drop a graphics card in here because I do want to check out the BIOS and see what's going on in this system and I've got just the candidate for [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that oh yes the perfect specimen [Applause] oh well the moment I plugged it in the motherboard's lit up so that's a good start there we go and after ages of memory training we were in business okay new CPU installed uh it's a good sign that this is all working and the next step after ineffectively poing at the BIOS was Final assembly oh it's actually a bit bigger than I was expecting it to be but it looks pretty badass it looks very nasses so these trays are where we're going to be mounting our eight hard drives this is on the back of the motherboard tray uh the power supply mounts in here and the drives just above [Music] that oh there are like no standoffs I see [Music] now the eaglee of you probably noticed that I just have six so ports on this motherboard Which is less than eight hard drives but luckily I have a very high effort workaround one of these bad boys which requires a whole lot of firmware being reflashed to it mode and whatever which seems like the kind of thing that I'm not nearly smart enough to do but we'll see hopefully it goes fine later in the video for now let's just drop it into the system and take it from [Music] there wow that looks well servery and again you may still be confused because this does not have sat ports on the front but I got a couple of these mini SAS to sat Port adapters so that we can plug our hard drives into this thing okay [Music] they've both clipped so either they're broken or they're connected one of the two clearly cable management is going to be a real fun time back here but before we worry about that let's install our massive amount of storage on these [Music] sleds oh wow I've almost dropped it twice and then you terrified Slide the [Music] drive okay that is the first of our very expensive drives seated so now we've just got seven more to go this is one of those processes that you kind of get bored over the over the duration of it I'm going to become progressively less careful as it as it goes on and then that's when terrible things [Music] happen but luckily nothing terrible happened with the first batch just leaving me with this sexy Bank of hard drives [Music] [Music] wow I am sweating bullets over here this is this is very stressful and after finishing up the second back of hard drives while sweating like a racehorse on steroids I was left with quite a mean looking machine [Music] [Music] so now that we finished building the Beast a process that was pretty straightforward now comes the fun part which is setting it up something which seems quite a bit more complicated the first step is to flash a new bios on our HBA card cuz the old one's all stinky and true nass is a germaphobe which involves getting a flash drive and making freedos and bios files happen on the flash drive and then inev L having the system reject the flash drive after the first try why is it doing that and the second okay it's unhappy again what in the world and the third try now it's just broken again oh my God until eventually you give up and plug the HBA card into a much older motherboard which isn't completely disgusted by non UEFI things hey that seems to be working freedos just discriminates against young Hardware that's kind of rude of it and at this point lots of Doss hacker Manning has to happen until the card successfully says it mode next to its name yay success okay very good and now is the perfect time to put the HBA card back in the nas and start the process of installing true Nas luckily the initial trass installation was real straightforward I just followed the steps and it installed but then I ran into a bit of an issue wait why isn't it giving me an IP address for me to connect to but despite rebooting several times the Nas still wasn't connecting to the network okay I've tried a bunch of stuff not of it worked so let me move it closer to where it's going to live and plug it into a different ethernet port so hopefully it finds it now but despite me pointing at stuff during the boot process to trick the system into thinking I knew what I was doing it still didn't find the network so it turns out the motherboard has some weird 2.5 GB Lan chipset on it so I'm willing to bet a substantial amount of money that's the problem so I'm going to quickly run home and pull the just normal Intel gigabit network card out of my home PC and hopefully that fixes it so just one one second one second a few moments later okay so this is just an Intel gigabit Ethernet card it should work if it doesn't work with this it's a different issue we have it sounds like firing up the Starship Enterprise that's crazy yes look at that got an IP address so now we can connect to it and make Nas happen yeah here is our I mean it's not 176 TB at this point because they're not actually 22 TB drives um so now I need to figure out how to make raid happen with this and then turn it into a pool for this Nas I wanted to use raid six so the two of the eight drives can die without me losing my data now for some reason tras calls this raid zed2 I guess they're hipsters or something and once I created my big storage pool I was left with 113 tabt of space which feels quite a lot less than I was expecting to get to be honest but it still gives me a lot of additional space above the 60 terab of data I already have and next I had to go through the unnecessarily complicated process of making that storage accessible on the Network okay so now with that frankly terrifying process over now comes the real fun copying 60 terabytes worth of data onto that Nas over gigabit Ethernet I just started copying 1 and 1/2 terabyte and it says it's going to take 3 hours and 45 minutes and then after that I still have 58 and a half to go in fact according to this data transfer calcul calator the process is going to take 6 and a half days which really puts into perspective how much 60 terab is or how slow gigabit Ethernet is depending on your outlook on life and at this point it really is my pathetic Network bottlenecking this transfer so what I'm going to do is order some 10 gbit Network stuff so we can run into different bottlenecks I'll do a short to update you on how much of a performance difference that makes because at this point it's a day and a half later and I've only copied the one 12 terab by drives worth of data over which brings me to the end of the video so subscribe to the channel if you don't want to miss the update thank you for watching and until then bye-bye [Music]",

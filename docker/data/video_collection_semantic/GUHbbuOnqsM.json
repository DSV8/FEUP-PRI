    "transcript": "We've become good friends with our next door neighbors. in comes TP-Link now what they sent us to save the day is a DECO X-20 kit fitted with three access points show up as three unique wi-fi signals they'll all be meshed together into one big network which is perfect for folks who have multiple devices to connect simultaneously now this kit's good for up to 5 800 square feet of living space or office space and that's uh quite a bit bigger than this house quite a bit bigger than most houses frankly we don't live in mansions over here but the good thing about this kit is that because he has external cameras security cameras around his home these are positioned again outside of the premises so the signal's got to travel through cinder block and other furniture and crazy things to get to these cameras having access points closer to them will result in better signal that means he can connect easier and faster the x20 uses the new wi-fi six protocol meaning we'll have the best of the best when it comes to signal given great distances it won't degrade as quickly as older wi-fi protocols and at the same time we're going to get that really seamless connectivity between three different access points over either wi-fi or hard-wired lan connection and of course because this is a mesh wi-fi system it means that each of these is going to blend together and work as one single large access point even though all three of them can act as standalone routers that's really convenient when again you have multiple devices that you don't want to connect to multiple networks depending on where you are in your home so this here is andre my next door neighbor say hi to youtube hey everybody i just wanted to make you feel awkward so his uh his wi-fi is not not the greatest so his internet service provider which is the same one that i have uh supplied him with a modem slash router combo i think and uh what we're going to do is take a look in his what do they call it little box cut out thing electric box i'm sure there's some like professional i.t word for it but anyway let's go check that out show us the goodies here it is nice nice sore houses actually have fiber and there's a fiber termination box outside from there we have this cat6 cable that runs into this gateway and this gateway kind of splits up all these different cat6 connections to various parts of the home he's actually not using any of them right now all we have here is just this and this is acting in this instance as a router so it's generating a wi-fi signal so all of his devices are connected just to this one box in this home and that's where this deco x20 comes into place we get three of these access points and we're going to set these things up you ready let's do it all right let's see what we have inside looks like i got three of these boxes access points i think we call them so we got some more cables and a lovely troubleshoot paper so that's literally it it's just this that's all you get in the box but i think that's a good thing because it means that it's going to be a pretty straight-up installation process i right making it awkward for you so the first thing we should do is disconnect this router hey uh hey andre i'm about to kill your wi-fi you cool with that go right in all right he's no he's definitely not doing anything important right now so here we go disconnecting all these again these uh these blue cat6 cables really don't go anywhere they're just uh pre wires for access points if you wanted to hardwire them the problem is a lot of these are in the ceiling and these deco x20s are designed to just sit on a desk or something so it's just a consequence of how the house was designed uh so we've got the gateway removed now we can set this first hub in here and it will fit nice and snug we already ran a test fit and we're gonna plug this ethernet cable into port one which oh whoops that was backwards plug in this way and then we'll plug in power into this uh power port here at the bottom and that's pretty much it for hub1 and so now this is blinking blue which means it's setting up we need to install the deco app at this point to configure everything so on android's phone here first thing we need to do is sign up in the app and now we can click begin our device is the x20 and now it's going to walk us through the installation process which we've kind of sort of already done but if you're new to this sort of thing it's nice to have an app that'll walk you through the steps now we're going to connect to the deco wi-fi this will be open in public for now for setting up then we can swing back into the app to complete installation now this first deco is placed kind of sort of near the living room so i'm just going to click living room you okay with that andre let's do it all right and now it's time to set up your network name and your password which i will give to you so i found some interesting wi-fi names for you andre we've got uh why fight the inevitable okay it burns when i pee all right and let's see we can click next add more deco okay so we need to do this next but let's make sure that this wi-fi is good as it is first is it does that say 50 shades of dre yes it does yes it does right so now we've got a green light which is a good sign and i think everything is set up now so i think dre's going to run a speed test now to see how quick just a single hub is and then we're going to add these extra two to strategic locations in his home to make sure everything is covered yep a seven ping that's yeah that seems much much better wow that's that's faster than mine dude do you have you have gigabit like gig up kick down i think so yeah yeah that's that's faster than what i have geez okay so those are really really good speeds right so uh that was super super fast and i think now all we need to do is just plug these other two in and i wanted to ask you where you wanted to plug these in so we know where those cameras are the corners of the house and obviously like i know you do some work from the bedroom or the wife does so where were you thinking we placed those i was thinking we we could put one right in our bedroom since we do a lot of work and stuff there and i have a camera and the other one i was thinking about just going towards the other corner of the house okay okay um where i have more cameras okay perfect yeah so then we'll have a nice triangle all this will be covered the back right corner of the house will be good to go especially that camera back there and then the front right corner of the house will also be super lit perfect cool so for these extenders it's literally as simple as just plugging them into power and they actually automatically connect to the the main access point which is really nice you don't even need to open the app we just kind of let these sit here they were yellow at first which means they're booting up and then they started flashing blue and then they just turned green right on their own so we didn't have to do anything and they're already added to the mesh network and again this entire wi-fi like signal is one it's one big signal it's not like split up so it's not like this is making its own wi-fi and all the others are making their own it's one big one so no matter where you go you just connect to the exact same single network and your devices will be good to go it's literally that simple so now is the fun part now that everything's set up we get to go outside and in and around your home and test we'll run speed tests and just see how much better it is can you already tell that it's like a big improvement oh it's like 10 times faster much better than that isps like default router right yes so i'm thinking let's do like the far corner of your your uh kind of kitchen living room area so over there which is the furthest i guess inside point from all of your mesh routers so jay's way over there and he's going to shout out the uploads and download speeds i'm thinking he'll be impressed download speed 265. nice uploads be 147. all right so now we're in the front room and he's actually standing next to one of the uh access points here we're going to see how decent the coverage is at this point in the house which is the front right room 211 download speed here 135 upload speed pretty good still above 100 a piece now we're out front next to one of his security cameras and see how decent coverage is out here okay we're at 171 download speed here nice that's going through concrete that's pretty good 105 uploads all right still over 100 a piece all right now just for the walls we're in the middle of the road in front of his house we're going to see if uh his signal is okay i don't know how this one's going to fare 30.2 download speed all right so we're on the edge five 5.18 so you know that you can get coverage basically up until the middle of the road in front of your house that's nuts that's exciting so that was pretty straightforward right it wasn't difficult literally just plug and play for the most part and that's what i really like about this so if you're not super like tech savvy i mean there's nothing really to worry about here i'm not very familiar with it internet stuff in general it's just not my cup of tea i'm more of like the hardware like desktop type guy and uh i mean you saw how little things you needed that came in the box to set this up and get it working and yeah for the most part the app runs itself it walks you through what little steps there are and then you've got a killer wi-fi network now and it's all unified under the same name the same password so no matter where you go including the middle of the freaking street you've got coverage like that's that's better than what i've got right now and i thought my stuff was pretty hot at the house so i'm a little jelly it's okay i'll let you use mine sometime hide your kids hide your wi-fi yeah your wi-fi hide your kids hide your wi-fi that's a good one uh well i want to thank tp-link for sponsoring this video for sending out the deco x20 uh it's a killer unit if you're into mesh wi-fi systems you have a bigger house especially or just in in dress case we have like security cameras around your home and you want extended coverage and this is not like a wi-fi extender kit that's not what this is each of these is its own unique router that creates a mesh wi-fi system which is why you get such great signal at such great lengths including in the middle of the street so this is what you want if you want a robust solution for the home you can even fit this out for an office and it's not going to break the bank either you can find it linked below in the video description so that was good stuff his entire home has been renovated with a brand new wi-fi system that is much stronger than what he previously had with that if you guys enjoyed this video be sure to let us know by giving this one a thumbs up that would be appreciated if you have not subscribed already consider doing that as well and we'll catch in the next one again big thanks to tplink for sponsoring this video i would have their products out in front of me but uh they're all at my neighbor's house now and i suppose that's a great way to end this video on a high note my name is greg thanks for learning with me",

    "transcript": "What's up guys? Lew here back with another video And today, we are checking out another device from BLU This is a more premium offering called the Pure XL [Lew drums table with fingers] A 6 inch, WQHD AMOLED display A 2560 resolution Gorilla Glass A 2 gigahertz octa-core processor Android lollipop, LTE A 24 megapixel camera. 8 megapixel selfie camera front facing, 64 gigs of memory three gigs of ram, fingerprint sensor, a big 35 hundred milli-amp power battery with quick charge. And it's relatively thin as well. So as you can tell a pretty impressive spec list It's around 350 bucks. One of my favorite features is that big battery. Even on flagship phones you don't necessarily see all the time you see the fingerprint sensors on the back right like that it appears the feature a removable back as you can see so you've got some expansion. Couple of sim card slots. Many of their phones feature dual sim card slots. And in this case micro SD so flexibility continues to be a key function here. This looks like your power slash hold switch here. Volume rocker and then another button down here guessing it's a dedicated shutter button probably for the camera that sort of right where your hand lines up. So satisfying some capacitive buttons on the bottom here, menu button, home button, and back button, forward facing camera, and speaker. Power brick quick charge as I mentioned before and get that thirty five hundred milli-amp power battery charged up in a... reasonable... *cough* Some headphones here. Oh these are cool okay so you've got an in your style with interchangeable tips so no matter what size your ear canal is you should be good. I've always wanted to do those custom in-ear buds that are molded to your canal... Jack knows what I'm talking about. You probably need them... more than I. ..gah-wee-uh gah-wee-uh rapee-duh... gah-wee-uh ra-pee-doh in other words the quick guide. Now this is interesting we have some NFC stickers that's cool. We can set up certain behaviors based on wherever we put these may be on the nightstand in the kitchen in the car so that the device can . . . now this cable this came with that mega battery blue phone that i unboxed recently but it also works as an OTG cable so use it for file sharing what not and just like the other products from these guys. . . They are giving you everything. You've got a screen protector even though you've got gorilla glass... TWO cases geez! And, one of them is a flip style like this standard...I believe that material is called TPU. Let's boot up the phone Oh hello there very nice yelling pretty responsive actually look at that OOOOOOOOOO! oooo, pretty quick too. You guys never get to see this camera. You're always look at the other camera See me up there in the corner? See me right in front and then you guys you guys are in the lens of course. These pictures look pretty good not too shabby the old selfie... you know what?! Man this beard is getting out of hand 3, 2, selfie. Saturated colors dark blacks *singing* The camera app is actually fairly configurable options for resolution and there's a countdown you have control over everything focus, shutter speed, white balance, IS0 Beauty shall I try a beauty Jack? All right fine, you've convinced me ohhhhhh yes! Smooth me out baby... Slimming! Oh hello there! Hello there slim Lew! Ready Set beauty hahaha! (laughing) I do like having this dedicated shutter button... Its just a little bit more satisfying the tapping the screen, okay?! Can you just go with that for a second?! Yelling...(spoken) As you know in this environment ok this is bright whenever I film a video in here I get a little bit of a suntan. Actually I don't tan very well I'm gonna be completely honest with you genetically that's not me. You probably saw my hockey video recently genetically that's me! Shovel a little snow you become a better man. Jack tell them! We're now at full brightness and i hope you appreciate that in this super bright environment you're actually still easily able to make everything out (video playing on the phone in the background) Can you hit one of these lights? I just want them to see the difference of how bright it is in here (video on the phone plays louder) yeah do that one too, lets see (...couple things no real quick on your first build don't...) So the speaker's on the bottom but it's actually pretty loud you're basically gonna get super dark blacks here very vibrant saturated colors if that's your thing probably should be In the fingerprint sensor scanner what do you say scanner sensor? I don't know add finger print, ok. Finger print Wah! Man, have they gotten quick sometimes you forget. So there you have it the Blu Pure XL a more premium product from Blu if you will. If you guys are interested in pricing and availability i will drop the link in the description is available unlocked from amazon, so check that out. Thank you very much for watching if you appreciate this content make sure to leave a thumbs up down below and i'll catch you on the next episode, later guys.",

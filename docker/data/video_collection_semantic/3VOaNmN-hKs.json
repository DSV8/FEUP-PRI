    "transcript": "(beeping) - All right, let's stop, one more time. All right, Ready? Hey, it's Justine And today I, I'm going to unbox something really massive. We got to get some tools. Now normally, I would unbox this with a small knife. Probably one of these will do. So inside of here is... An Xbox. That's all I'm gonna tell you right now, Unless you read the title. (playful music) I don't know if I'm doing a very good job or not. I switched knives Cause I thought maybe this might be better. I thought that we did a good job already, But clearly there's a whole another layer. I'm just holding this knife now for, protection. I think. Oh, oh my gosh. There's Master Chief. Master chief was larger than life. This is a life, Well, this is more than a life-size Xbox. I wonder if this is the first unboxing. Could be. This is So Cool. Jenna has pulled the emergency cable off Of my garage door. I'm still not actually not sure What's even in here. So this is what the Xbox series X packaging will look like. Granted, I don't think it's going to be this big, But this looks like the retail box right here. One terabyte, 4k one twenty. This is so massive! This is actually larger I think, Than my first apartment in Los Angeles. Jenna can attest to that. Look 8K HDR! I guess let's, let's go inside. Roll the dramatic music, now! Guys, it's happening! It's Happening! Oh my gosh, oh my gosh Oh my gosh! We're not done yet. My gosh. Jenna, put your head in here. Put your head in here. Oh my God. It's actually, It looks exactly like the freaking X-Box, But it's a refrigerate... it's a refrigerator! They made the meme a thing. How do I get you out of here? Okay, Jen. This says we need two people For deployment of ramp. - [Jenna] Yes. - I am one. You are two. - That's the math. - Yep. Oh, okay. So be careful. Oh my, okay. All right. Okay. Okay. I mean, I guess we just... now what do we do? - [Jenna] You gotta put, put the roof down. - [Justine] Okay. - [Jenna] What are you doing? - [Justine] I don't know. - [Jenna] Get out the way. There you go. Ready? One, two, three. - [Justine] No! Look at this! Oh my gosh! What in the world... This is so insane! I am... I can't believe it! Is this a trick? Are you guys gonna close me up and then ship me off somewhere? I can't wait to put all my yerba mates in here. Just pull on it. Okay. Oh gosh. It's it's moving. It's moving. It's moving. Jenna, what did you think you were doing today? Not this. Just this fridge have wheels. - [Jenna] I think so, its colliding very... - Welcome to your new home. (Background Music) The huge box is gone. The fridge is now officially here in the garage next to baby! Well, this is actual size. I haven't even opened it up yet. I need to put my yerba in there. Oh, this is like a very, very nice refridge... Like this is a really nice fridge. This is like an actual refrigerator. Oh wow. Should I plug it? The back is also a replica of the tiny, The actual. I keep calling it a tiny Xbox series X, But it's the actual size Xbox series X. So this is where the expansion card goes. We've got our HDMI. Wow. Let's open this up. Whoa! That's custom. This whole thing is custom. Can you imagine somebody just calling someone And being like \"Hey, can you, can you do this\" Ready? (screaming) It freaking lights up! What! Oh my god! It is! I have goosebumps right now. Okay they may have not... No they're there. They're there. I promise you. But I just got chills when I opened this up. Okay let's do it again. Yeah put that in there. - [Jenna] Here we go. How did they get a frigging custom sound In this refrigerator? Where is that coming from? Right here! - [Jenna] Right there is a custom speaker? - This is so awesome. I can't believe this. This is so crazy. I, I'm like speechless. - [Jenna] The green lovely touch. - [Justine] Its such a lovely touch. This is a nicer refrigerator Than I have in my house right now, But this will not fit inside of my house. (calm music) Hello and welcome to my refrigerator. Goodbye. A little touch of wifi here. A little touch of wifi there. (slow beat music) This is one of three refrigerators that were made. So X-Box thank you guys so much For sending me those. This is so amazing. They're actually going to be doing A Twitter sweepstakes, To give away the third one. I have one and Snoop Dogg has one And one of you guys might win one as well. Make sure you check out X-Box on Twitter For all of the information. And I look forward to gaming season Because it is just about here. So I got to fill this up with snacks, snacks, Snacks, Snacks.",

    "transcript": "O11 air is finally here it's received a lot of hype for good reasons I've also been really wanted to work in something like this and put in as many fans and here as possible and build like an airflow focus system because with the dynamic while it was you know beautiful and received a lot of good attention for good reasons make sure to check out all the content that we made out over here it was mainly like you put in the radiator system in there maybe a custom loop while the air in the name obviously indicates its particular focus for airflow focus systems air flow focused air focused too many focus air but I am concerned because while the chassis is pretty wide to accommodate for that dual chamber design the main chamber where the system sits is pretty slim and we only have a hundred and fifty five millimeters of CPU tower clearance that means many enthusiast air coolers will not fit in here like noctus NHD u14 many be quiet tower coolers like the dark crock pro 4 and just for one because they are slightly taller at 160 millimeters and so having a little of 5 millimeters would really accommodate for that enthusiast airflow market but now you have a bit of a compromise here because you have to look for slightly shorter CPU tower and just to clarify the dynamic and the air are basically the exact same case so any limitations that we're talking about today about the CPU cooler height also applies with the dynamic because it's an indent called internal structure only the exterior differences plus we have the additional fans at the front there and you can check out our full review for dynamic right over here where we go a lot more in depth about everything else that we might not cover in this video so make sure to check it out and now it all makes sense while Lian Li sent over the cryorig h7 because none of the coolers that I have would fit and this does it's only 145 millimeters because initially I'm air cooling my 87 kaor rising cpu obviously want to use something beefier like this dark rock pro 4 it's nice but it's just way too tall for the case that's unfortunate so let us analyze right after this evolve with the times consider nvme storage today the new RC 100 brings affordable nvme storage into your hands with various capacities in this super compact form factor that plugs directly into your motherboard it's extremely powerful and utilizes the Sheba's advanced 3d flash memory for awesome speeds so you can be a happy user the RC 100 by Toshiba the nvme drive to consider check it out below alright so the O11 air comes in two variants the standard model that comes with two 120mm fans it goes for $129 which is the exact same price as the dynamic so there is no compromise of which one you want to choose if you want to go with something but more airflow focused versus something bored more elegant with the dynamic this is your pick but then there's the second version the RGB one that comes with three 120mm fans that are RGB that have this aluminum frame these are the be our light 120 so the RGB version is $149 which is a $20 premium for three other snow fans for a total of five which is awesome because you can mount those three fans potentially in the front to have that nice glow or the top or the side or the bottom and still have two additional fans that you can mount anywhere else in the case it's a pretty decent deal for a total of five fans but I have something else in mind and we yes those fans cost more than the case itself but when you focus his airflow you got to go with knock door now from a design perspective it is warming up to me but I was hoping for a slightly more color variation in the in the entire body because it's all black and there is a bit of a discrepancy between the matte black plastic and the slightly shiny metal it would be awesome to have like darker gray grilles over here so that it has a little bit of extra pop and potentially emphasize that airflow angle but you are paying the exact same price of 129 for the dynamic or the air so there is no you know price incentive to choose one over the other however with the air while you do get additional plastic here while you get metal on the glass on the dynamic you do have additional fans at the front while the dynamic has no fans at all but the two cases share the exact same internal structure which is awesome so no surprises there aside from the air having a new bracket at the front to support those front fans and so you know dual chamber design the main motherboard area has a ATX motherboard support I do love those angle or rubber grommets on the side so if you have sleeve cable extensions the 24 pin cable you know angle can look really good there and there's plenty of space above the motherboard for radiator and set of fans plus the rubber grommet throughout any cables that you need there at the back we have a power supply that is angled towards the side panel you can also remove the hard drive to accommodate for a second power supply the cable cover can support additional storage and also cover all your cables there they have added additional holes for the back of the case to mount 80 millimeter fans you can mount two of them so you can have additional exhaust and overall this case is really meant to have this like playground of airflow and how you want to mount and where you want to mount those fans so front intake the side intake or exhaust top intake or exhaust bottom most likely intake and the rear exhaust as well and so this means that all sides the top the front the bottom and the side support a 3/16 other radiator and you can mount a two eighty rather the top or the front so airflow options are plenty and in my dynamic configuration i mounted nine fans you can check out the results of the temperatures there but with the air we have three additional intake so you can mount 12 fans total plus two additional 80 mm vents in the back that is pretty insane so now it's time to build my ultimate airflow system windows not to us all right so the build is finished and I think the system looks absolutely awesome with these Noctua fans I don't mind the color variation between the brown plants and the rest of the system because I'm not adding any RGB strips in there so you know having that additional like one component from a hardware that kind of stands out it's nice because they're all uniform and stuff and I even disabled the LED RGB on the cooler because it just didn't make sense I then used came Awad sleeved extensions to demonstrate that beautiful Bend from the side rubber grommets because we're not adding any lighting and these extensions just add that one extra premium element I love it but if you are going for some form of like RGB element through fans keep in mind that illumination will be hidden from the angle and so when I installed my inner max tbh RGB fans because of that beautiful ring illumination they shine right through the front which is awesome so just keep that in mind when you know assembly in your own system and potentially adding RGB lighting or fans and you can check out cable mod extensions and the inner max RGB fans and down description below now just to come back to this whole conversation about CPU tower compatibility with the O11 air and mounted my pure rock from be quiet it's a really good tower it's supposed to be a hundred and fifty five millimeters in height which is perfect for this case however I was still having issues with the glass panel interfering with the top heat pipe stoppers which got me thinking is pure rock or be quiet advertising there spec wrong is the CPU tower actually taller than 155 millimetres or is liam lee in the wrong by not including exact dimensions for their CPU tower height compatibility so after measuring the CPU tower it is in fact Be Quiets fault they are not advertising their correct spec for the pure rock but actually many other coolers who knows but the top of the heat pipe is what goes beyond the hundred fifty five millimeters and that is an issue because it's misleading customers it does not advertise the true height of the coolers and moving forward where cases are getting smaller you need that precision and I'm quite disappointed that it's not coming from be quiet who are known for German engineering and this got me thinking because my smaller cryorig h7 cooler that actually fits inside the enclosure it cannot adequately cool my overclocked 8700K and therefore we have to compromise so I have to speed up by fans to full speed about 2,000 rpm and I have to lower my clock speeds on the CPU my system becomes quiet loud now granted it is a $35 cooler it is pretty affordable purchase links are in description below but it is only one of the few that actually fits inside this enclosure so you might have to re-strategize potentially going with all-in-one coolers or a custom loop inside the 11 air now as for air flow testing Steve from gamers Nexus pointed out that the dust filter was a choking point for airflow and I've experienced the same thing you know you can see the CPU and GPU temperatures are higher when the dust filter is installed and this is running at full speed with those beautiful amazing Noctua fans so the difference it will definitely be higher you know the delta between the CPU and GPU temperatures with lower quality fans when the dust filter is installed so keep that in mind and so if you do have the edge for the 11th series the air is a fantastic option just have to keep in mind with the CPU cooler tower height limitations and the additional front intake definitely could be used for radiators or an all-in-one cooler that could deliver that there's no fresh air that we do not see with the dynamic version now one last thing I want to mention with the front panel is that the pegs that are attached to the actual frame are pretty short so actually attaching the front panel is a little bit more difficult and also the front IO which has a type C port gen 2 which is awesome they'll get also stuck in between the frame and the plastic so you have to align them properly and also be careful not to turn the system on when doing so and so to conclude I think I got all really excited about the all of an air thinking that's going to be like the next unique airflow enclosure and while it is you just have to approach it with those limitations in mind but see you cannot mount any of the most popular even like mid-range air coolers inside here what is the point then you have to reconsider go with an all-in-one cooler and that take advantage of that additional front intake I still love this dual chamber layout and hopefully see more like it and just how much cooling it can house in such a tiny enclosure but guys I'm Dmitry thanks for watching make sure to subscribe to our new boot sequence channel and check out this other relevant content let me know what you think of the O11 air and how you know potentially you want go with that or the dynamic yeah see you later",

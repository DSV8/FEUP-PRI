    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine. And today I am so excited because in front of me is the latest and greatest in cat technology. This is the brand new Litter Robot 4 and this is a self cleaning cat litter box. Now you're probably saying Justine, we know that you do not have a cat. So why would you be unboxing this and showing it to us? Well, my friend Ed has two cats, Link and Gus and I have basically watched these cats grow up from the day that he got them to now. And I'm so excited because he actually has one of the older versions of this. A huge thank you to Litter Robot 4 for partnering with me on this video. I am so excited to unbox this and take it over to my friend Ed's house and get his kitties a litter box upgrade. Here we go. I just love finding really cool pet tech, because I feel like so many of us have animals and anything that can make our lives easier I'm a huge fan of. Oh I love this, it says best day ever for you and your cats. I also have a feeling, knowing Ed's cats, that they would probably really love this box. So this is the white version, there is actually two colors. I asked Ed what color he wanted and he chose the white. So I'm very excited to see what this looks like in his place. We've got the power adapter here. Here it is. I'm so excited for his cat to get this. Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep. Look at this. It's kind of awesome because you put the kitty litter in, and then when your cat uses it and it goes to the bathroom, it then spins and rotates and gets the potty all clumpy. And then it could just empty it right here in the tray. That is so convenient. - [Jen] Spaceship for cats. - It does look like a little spaceship. Well, now that it's unboxed, let's go head to Ed's house and see what his cats think. You ready, Jen? - Yeah. - Okay. Let's go. - I love that this has an app for your phone that you can connect to and monitor waste. It's self cleaning, so there'll be a clean bed of litter every time your cat uses it. It also has odor control and a carbon filter to reduce any unwanted smells. This is suitable for up to four cats so if you do have more than one then this is great for sharing. I love that it has a safe cat system so it makes sure your cat is safe when using the Litter Robot. it's super quiet, easy to clean and reduces airborne and surface litter dust. Ed, your surprise is here. It's actually not a surprise 'cause I told him I was coming over and I told him exactly what I was bringing. I'm so excited for you to check this out. Hi Link. - He's so scared. - Oh my gosh, don't be scared. It's a spaceship, you have the old version. - [Jen] I think he's scared of you. - [Ed] Yeah, what's what he's scared. - Yeah. Oh me? - Because he loves the litter- - Yeah, he likes the litter. - I was trying to make excuses. It's cool, because in the beginning they did have a little introduction of how to acclimate your cats to this. So we actually need to put some kitty litter in here which I assume you have. I forgot to bring you some. - No, that's- - Okay, let me get my phone and connect it to the app. What should we name it? How about Ed's Potty? I'm connecting a kitty Litter Robot. Your robot is connected and will be ready, so a clean cycle is gonna begin shortly. Okay, I think we need to probably put some kitty litter in here. This is great because Ed has one of the older versions, so he's basically a professional at this. We're just upgrading his crib. Well, the cat's crib. Should we load it up? - Let's do it. - Okay. - Do you think we can get them to pee or poo on command? (both laughing) - [Jen] Can you pee or poo on command? - No! - I mean, we could certainly try. - [Jen] Should we take a bet on who's gonna do it first? Look at Gus. - Oh, probably- - Link or Gus? - You guys have to meet Link and Gus? They are so freaking cute, like they're the coolest cats I've ever met. - [Jen] If we just back up and let them- what- - Okay. - [Jen] Like natural instincts take over. - Okay, let's see. - Okay. So we're just gonna go about our business. - You got a customer. - [Justine] We've a customer. Oh my God. - [Jen] First customer. - [Justine] This is the best day of my life. Oh my he's digging. Oh my God. Do we have a potty? Do you think he gonna do- - Oh yeah. - I'm gonna stop talking. - [Ed] Good boy Link - [Justine] No way. I feel so uncomfortable, zero privacy. Do you think he's making a turd? - [Ed] Nah, pee. - [Justine] Oh my gosh, there it is. There's pee. He's covering it up. This is, this is like some sort of like nature show. - [Ed] Yeah, how do they know to do that? Like how'd you get litter on- - Good job. - Awe! (cheering applause) - Good job buddy! - [Justine] Good job, we're so proud of you! - [Jen] That's a very good job. - [Justine] We're so proud of you. - [Jen] You feel light? - [Justine] So Ed, we had our first customer. - Yeah, it was pretty exciting - So exciting. So it even takes the pet weight, (gasps) 9.24 pounds. - That's awesome. - Cat detected inside globe at 3:48. It's even showing how full the drawer level is, 33% full. Now, when you, when they pee like you just kind of let it go, right? - Yeah. It just dries up. And when that starts to run after a few minutes, when it knows the cat's not in there, it waits a few minutes, that lets it kind of get a little soaked up. And when it rotates, a pee will become just as much of like a, you know, thing as a, as a little turd and it just gets filtered right out from the screen. - Do you think that we can get a turd today? So I feel like I met Link and Gus like when they were babies. - Yeah. After moving out here, I would call my parents or FaceTime them just to see my cat. I, you know, was really lonely. I wanted to have cats again, I'm a cat person. It just so happened after about nine months of searching, I lucked out and found Link and Gus. They were born within the same week, two separate litters two separate types of cats, but they knew each other. And that meant a lot to me. And 11 years later, I think it means a lot to them, so. - They're so sweet, they're my favorite. I mean, I just look at this as easy to clean too. It's like, here you go. All of your waste is here. You have the litter liner, you can just throw that away. Yeah, this just pops off too so you can clean that. I just can't believe that we got a pee on demand. - Yeah. Link you're a great patient. - Thank you so much for your service. I was just really excited when they reached out and told me that they had this coming out because I'm a huge fan of like a pet products. Like there's so many cool things out there. And the fact that this one has been around for a while and they have this, it's all new, all upgraded. And the fact that you can monitor this from an app is so incredible. We have the time, we have the weight of your cat that went in, which is good because- they both- - That's awesome. - Weigh a different amount. - Yeah. - So you'll be able to tell. - So I'll be able to know who- - Did a number one or a number two based on their weight 'cause Gus weighs like two pounds or about a pound and a half more than Link. And that helps me to understand that the cats are going to the bathroom and if they're not, they might be stressed or there might be a problem. And now that it has the weight, I can tell which one has gone. - Well, thank you guys so much for watching and Ed, thank you so much for participating in our little review video here. - Thank you. This is so exciting. You guys wanna get more information about the Litter Robot 4 by Whisker I'll put a link in the description and with that I'll see you guys later. You gotta keep us updated when you when you get a number two. - Oh yeah. I'll text you every time. - Okay, great. Yeah. Just send me some screenshots of, of the app. - I'll send you the weight too. - All right. Bye guys, thank you. - Ed just so happens to have some fake poo, so for the sake of the demo, we're gonna test it out. It's also cool because you can manually do a cycle with these buttons. There it goes. I didn't even think that we were gonna be able to test the turd and here, here we are. There it is. Oh my gosh, It's going away! There it goes! (both laughing) I don't know why I'm so amused but this is incredible. - [Ed] Yeah, it's pretty great. - [Justine] Wow!",

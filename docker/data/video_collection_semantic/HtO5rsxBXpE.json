    "transcript": "- Today, you are probably expecting me to do, another Mac, or Apple, or Iphone video, but we're not. Today, we're gonna be doing my ultimate gaming PC setup. This the Origin PC Millennium and I got this for a specific project, that I was working on. We did a series of 3 VR videos that were all shot in 3D, and they're 180. And we needed a PC specifically for the Z CAM software that we were using. Huge thank you to Origin for sending me this, that we were able to get this project done on time. I actually did an unboxing of this in 3D. Probably one of the most fun that I've had unboxing anything, ever. Spoiler alert, there's a chainsaw and maybe a flamethrower involved. And they turned our really well, so if you guys wanna see those, I'll put a link in the description. I've been really exited to finally set up this PC gaming station, so today's the day, but I need you guys to just take a look at this thing. Should we boot it up? We needed something that was gonna be powerful enough for VR and this was their suggestion. So let me just open this up here so you guys can get a really good look. So this thing is super powerful, it got us through all of our VR videos that we are working on. And now it's time to finish the gaming set up. There is a monitor that I've have had my eye on since I went to see CES last year and it is finally here. (struggles) You got to work out more. Oh wow, alright, here we fricking go. Wow. (blows on monitor) (sound of crinkling bag) Razer has a theme. Even their power supply, has a green cable on it! (Nods in agreement) cool. (Throws the box away) I should probably show you this from the back. Look at this great cable management! We've got a bunch of other cables here, we have a display port, we have a USBC, we also have, regular USBA connector. This looks like some green pasta! I've got something else to go with this monitor. The thing that I didn't tell you at the beginning, unless you saw the thumbnail. This ultimate PC set up , has a theme, and it's a color theme, and it's not green. (Opens a box) (sighs) (Surprised) (Giggles) There it is. This is the new Razer Blade, 15 inch quartz. I am such a huge fun of all of their pink accessories so my friends, that's the theme, of my ultimate gaming set up. This is definitely more for gaming on the go, but when I'm at home, obviously, I'll be using the Origin PC as my desktop situation. Situation? What is this? What is (laughs) What a Jersey Shore? (laughing) Situation, my, I don't do, I can't even think of a better word. (laughs) So for the past few years, I'll be collecting all of the accessories from the Razer Quartz line, and now, it is finally time to put them all together in my ultimate PC gaming set up. (light music) (up beat music) Here it is. This is honestly, been something that I've wanted to set up for so long. I finally have all of the pieces, everything is together and it is a pink dream. So now lets go through everything that I have set up, One of the best part about this, is these course air fans that are in here are all controlled by an app. All of the Razer LED lights are also controlled by an app. So I can basically make these any other color that I want, but, why would I wanna do that? This is my pink set up, you can judge me, all you want, cause I know you're gonna do it. But I don't care. These side lights that we have, are mostly just for shooting, but these things are so great. Let me just show you this real quick. These are Nanlites. They're these really cool tube lights, that you can control all of the colors and this is like my new favorite thing, that we got, for the studio, to make shots look great. So of course the center piece to all of this is, the Origin Millennium PC. So this is a special edition unlocked 9th Gen Intel Core I9 we've got an eight Gig and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Super Ventus GPO. 32 Gigs of DDR 4 RAM 1 terabyte western digital SSD. 12 terabytes Seagate BarraCuda mechanical hard drive. (mumbles) RGB premium fans and holding everything together we have an MSI Z390 Gaming Edge AC motherboard. I do need to work a little bit on the cable management, but I did set this up pretty quickly. So all things considered, I think it looks pretty good. So let's first show you guys the Razer Synapse App, you may have seen this before if you are familiar with all of Razer's accessories but this thing is awesome. Here you can see everything that we have connected each of these accessories is easily configured through the app, so for example, when you click into the mouse, you can customize performance, lighting, and you can calibrate it. There's a bunch of quick effects, there's advanced effects, but if you just want to have a static color, that's super easy just pick up the color that you want and that will just be a static color. It's super customizable and you could do that for all your peripherals. So this is the CORSAIR iCUE app. CORSAIR also has a lot of really great LED accessories. So if you have their keyboard, their mice, or if you have some of them installed in the RGB fans, that can also all be controlled here through the iCUE app. I'm pretty happy with these colors, so I think we're just gonna leave it at how it is. But if I wanted to, I could spend hours customizing all of the colors, and synchronization to what's on my screen. I'm not gonna do that right now, because I've got more to show you. Over here we have my custom camo Xbox. I would say its one of a kind, but its actually two of a kind. This was actually made for a charity event last year so I got one and also someone who participated in the charity event also got one, and I know its not plugged in yet but it will be. Obviously we've got our mouse, keyboard. We've got a nice quartz pink microphone, This one actually doesn't have any lights on it. We've got a 15 inch quartz blade laptop that you saw in the unbox earlier in this video, and then I know this is a PC set up, but I'm iJustine and I couldn't help it, Over here, is my pink 16 inch MacBook pro. I'm sure many of you guys ar very familiar with dbrand and a huge thank you to them for supporting my channel. This is one of the new, pink skins that they have and they not only have this for the laptop, they have them for so many other accessories. I have been such a huge fan of dbrand for so long. So you guys are are the best. Under here, this is actually another pair of headphones. These ones I mostly use when I'm playing Xbox. And then under under here, these things are amazing. So these are specifically designed for Xbox. These are a 4D experience. They give you haptic feedback when you're playing games, so its kind os a little vibration. You can adjust the levels if it's a little bit too aggressive for you. But these have been so much fun when I'm playing Call of Duty and yeah, they're, so massive. But they're really light, so it doesn't really feel like they're that huge. Well that's it for my ultimate PC gaming set up Let me know what you guys think. Oh I forgot to. I forgot to mention my art. So these are some paintings that my friend Susie got for me a few years ago, and finally they now have a home. I love the fact that we can kind of have like a little gradient happening here. The pink leading into the purpleish lights, Then we have our blue little Matty, beautiful. Oh! I almost forgot, underneath the desk is this Jax & Bones bed that Matty, he's a doggy ambassador for Jax & Bones. I just wanna say he's famous. He loves to sit underneath of my desk when I'm working, or editing or gaming. Not so much when I'm gaming cause I start yelling and flailing my limbs around. So he usually, he sits those ones out. Well, thank you guys so much for checking out this video. I had so much fun putting it all together. Let me know if there's anything else you think that is missing from this gaming set up. Maybe a pink gaming chair. Hm. So don't forget to like this video and subscribe If you enjoyed it. I will see you guys in my next video. (up beat music) I also got a small injury because I dropped the monitor on my finger. Its like a blood blister. At least it's pink.",

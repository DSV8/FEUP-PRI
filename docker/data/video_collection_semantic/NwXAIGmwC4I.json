    "transcript": "- I like the new house. It's got most of the things that I care about in it, but my first love isn't here yet. (Yvonne laughing amusingly) We haven't moved our computers, alright? The computer room is empty. So the goal today is to get both mine and Yvonne's computers moved over here, set up, and most importantly wired in. And it's gonna be a little bit tricky because unlike most peoples' computers, who sit right next to their monitor and their peripherals, ours are gonna sit somewhere in the depth of the basement and use fiber-optic cables to connect to our stations here in the office. It should go fine? You know who else is fine? Our sponsor! ViewSonic! Their Elite XG3-21 UG mini-LED monitor offers a 4K native IPS panel with 144Hz refresh rate, and G-Sync Ultimate R4, and a quantum dot color layer, so it's great for gamers and creators. Learn more at the link down below. (digital beeping curiously) (energetic electronic music) This is where my computer plugs in. I have no idea how that's gonna reach my computer, and I can't even reach it. Fortunately for today's endeavor, I do have a helper. - Hello! - Special guest appearance, Luke Lafreniere. I love your shirt, by the way. - Ah, we traded! (Luke laughing happily) - This is not the company I work for. - Where are they supposed to go, where's your computer? - Well, they're gonna have to go into the... Oh, my computer's not here, we're gonna have to move that. - Oh. - You thought I was prepared for this or what, like? (Luke laughing amusingly) Like the main problem isn't gonna be the computer, it's gonna be the- - Wait, wait, what's... I think this is mine. - What, this? - Yeah. - Well, for all the stuff employees have stolen from me over the years, I think I was entitled to- - You get one? (Luke laughing loudly) - You actually gave it to me. - Oh, did I? - You had two. The main problem is gonna be all the peripherals, and accessories, and microphones, and stuff like that. - You're just gonna start unplugging and I just grab stuff? - We didn't bring any bins. The problem with cable management is at some point, you have to unmanage it. - I wonder if you could make that better. - Oh, Luke teasing the new products. Yes, we'll be showing our new cable management product today, the early prototypes. I found a box. (equipment thudding loudly) Well, this is great. What is hanging off of me? Ugh, these cable ties, they're so sticky. Lttstore.com. - Do you wanna help me move the monitor? - Yeah, sure. - Do you wanna... Oh, okay. See it's like really expensive, so I was gonna be careful with it, but he just... (computer clicking diligently) - While Linus plays with his little PC, we're going to be solving important problems, like whether or not our van fits in here. Now I say \"important,\" but my solution to this is really simple, let's just park the van over there. But, Linus is really insistent that it has to go on this side, so I guess it's important to him. We have these two steps here and I think the front of it might just cross it, so it might not work. But, we're going to clear the space and try to figure that out for him. - We already moved Yvonne's computer. (Linus grunting effortfully) I'm really, really looking forward to having proper access to all sides of my rack. - I'm excited for having access to all sides your rack too. - Thanks Luke, that's cute. This is really not my finest work! Just higher professional movers. They don't have to cost as much as the horrible quote we got. You should, you should... Yeah, this is not good. Don't overburden yourself there, Luke! - That was a lot! - It's a heavy load! - I'm just gonna make sure- - I'm really glad you're not overburdening yourself. - I'm just gonna make sure that you can... Yeah, there you go. Can I stack this on top? - No! (Luke laughing amusingly) - I think it's just the monitor and we're good. - Yeah sure, I'll do a sweep upstairs and make sure... Actually, I'm gonna pull this in. Whoo! Ow! - What a good driver. (Linus imitating beeping loudly) - Okay so, you wanna help guide me in? - Sure. You're not straight! (Luke laughing loudly) - Oh, you're just finding this out now? Okay, Luke am I in? - No, you gotta go deeper. - [Linus] Okay. That's all I got. (Luke laughing amusingly) - [Luke] You gotta keep coming, you gotta push! - You gotta keep comin'. Okay, stop. Your bumper's over the stair. Well just barely, just barely. - Oh, wow. What about the back though? - You have a lot of room actually. - I mean, I don't know if I'd call it a lot of room. Okay, this is a high-risk maneuver. We're gonna close the garage and I'm gonna back up. It's a high risk maneuver! - [Luke] Think of the views, Linus, just drive right through the door. (Linus laughing amusingly) - [Yvonne] That's much better. - Just realized we forgot the rails for this thing. So I'm hauling it down here, but I can't even mount it. I do have Yvonne's rails here, so I can at least mount one of them for now. Okay, so you guide your side in, I guide my side in. Anytime. - Sorry, it's just really big. It's hard to- Just giver! - It's time to figure out if this reaches. Oh this is bad, this is not long enough. Wait, the green fiber only needs to go to the Icron dock. Where are the Icron docks? Yay! That's the source side, this is the client side. Here's what I'm kind of feeling, Luke. - What are you feelin'? - Without any desks, let's just see if all the in-floor and in-wall fiber optics actually work. - Okay, so we're going functionality first. - Let's go function first. - Sounds good. - Mark, come check this out. Remember the fiber optic and display port cables that I showed you down in the server room? Well this (Linus humming presentation music) is theoretically how it works! You just plug in and you're good to go! These little covers here, very, very important. They keep the (Linus grunting effortfully) fiber optic ends clean. 'Cause if they get dirty, it's a real chore to clean them. And then you just plug it like that! Easy! What do you think are the odds that it lights up? Hello, are you on or not? - [Luke] No dice? - Wait, what is this? Why would we put two extensions on it? Now, we're gonna plug in directly. I think this might be that end. - Oh goodness, I see it. Do you want me to grab it? - Hold on. (Linus grunting carefully) - Oh. - Sorry. Nobody breathe, everybody don't breathe. Wait, what the hell? Okay, yes. - So it's going in here? - It's in here. Aw, balls! - So it's right here. - I was plugging completely the wrong cable in. Oh wait, yes, they're labeled. I have the other end of the cable you are holding. This is the rack end, which explains why that was so short because it was never intended to go in the rack. - I was actually wondering how I was supposed to plug in her fiber unit 'cause I didn't see any plugs on that side. There is the hole in the floor. - This is great news! It means that this goes to you, this plugs into Yvonne's fiber USB thing. That means this one next to it is almost certainly the one on my end. Wait no, not... Where was the one next to it? There was one bundled with that one. - I'm pretty sure that was it. - Yeah, okay! I'm feeling good. Wait, this doesn't help us with the display port. Do you wanna go check if there's a label on the DP cable sticking outta the wall? - 24! - Some of these aren't even labeled. - Yeah, but they have labels here. - 24! - This is 24, yeah. - Okay! - Alright, got it, got it, got it, got it! - Yay! Now, we need to know if it's actually gonna work through the wall plane thing. - [Luke] We're gonna be okay. (Luke laughing amusingly) - That goes there. (Luke cheering successfully) Yes. We're not outta the woods yet though. Just because it's working at 4K, 60Hz, doesn't mean that it has the signal integrity to work at 4K, 120Hz. Actually, it seems to be working at 120Hz right now. (Luke laughing happily) That's a very good sign. Minor detail, I haven't transported my desk to the new place and I didn't bring a drill here, so I guess I get to do this manually, taking the top off. - We're not gonna hit, I'm good? Whoa, would've hit that. - Look at this guy's showboating. As soon as the camera turns on, he's like, \"Oh, I'll grab something heavy now.\" It should be noted, this is not the final form desktop for the new place. These are cable management speed holes that are from my previous setup. And that's not actually the full size that I'm gonna be putting there. But what I can do is I can set everything up the way that I think it will go, maybe put some like cardboard extensions, map out exactly where I want all the new holes. And then I can use it as a template for the real desk, put all the holes in, and then I'll be ready to go right outta the gate. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Stop. Luke's busy upstairs, so my plan is to solo install Yvonne's machine in the rack. You know, I had actually intended to upgrade her GPU, but I do not know where that graphics card is. It's the Titan RTX. Aw, crap. Now I need these out. Don't worry, I'm a professional. But, I have... Whoa! Solo installed these a few times. That happens once in a while. - I've never built one of these before, but it seems pretty straightforward, so not a big deal. (drill revving loudly) As I miss, very cool. - Luke, we don't need this cable management tray because I have the cable management thing I've been teasing all day. On the surface, these are perfectly normal cable management arches. But, what's special about them (Linus laughing impressively) is how strong they are. So, you'll be able to use all the different sizes to manage everything from gigantic bundles of wire like this down to individual wires. Boop! Here's an example of a perfect application for these. I put a cable tie on this and had it just hanging here. But what I could have done, since I know that this is temporary and I'm gonna do a better job of this later, is just gone like this. Boop! These are little steel plates, and these are gonna be really useful for our cable management stuff. The ones that we actually make are gonna have holes in them instead of just adhesive, but you'll be able to stick them onto anything. And then you'll be able to take all your tables or whatever and you'll be able to run them through there. (Linus humming diligently) And then, you'll take your little arch and boop, cable manage it down into place. There's gonna be one that's designed to hold down power bricks like this. Look, they gotta understand the products, they're gonna have to run this business for us someday. Then there's this one, which is designed for you to run a cable tie through it, like this. And then that one can hold as many things as you can fit in a cable tie. - You're good. - Wow, you're going... Okay sure, yes. Why not? He's taking shortcuts here, ladies and gentlemen. (Linus laughing amusingly) I used to have two staples in here holding this extra coil of wire. - [Luke] They look like suns. - No more, all about the magnets now. Hello? Okay. Whoo! - Whoa. - Okay, flippin' awesome. Really not my finest work, but hey, it's all magnetic, so it's super easy to change, which is cool. But I saved the coolest part for last. Part of the point of having my machine in a central location like this, and then using fiber-optic cabling to get signals elsewhere in the house is that I can actually use it in different parts of the house. Is there an HDMI to there? Crap, I don't think there is. That's okay, we can cheat! Unfortunately, this one's only HDMI 2.0, so it'll do 4K, 60Hz. Still, that's perfectly fine for our demo. There's conduits so that I can run something HDMI 2.1 compliant over to the theater room, or to the LAN room, or wherever the case may be. Okay, AUX1. Please, just immediately work. What are the odds? My brain hurts. - [Mark] It'll work. - It didn't work, you lied to me. Second display is here. Extend, duplicate these displays. - [Yvonne] Do you guys need any help? - We are so good at this. (Luke laughing amusingly) Okay theoretically, Steam Big Picture. Down we go. There it is! We got 'em, ladies and gentlemen! \"TowerFall\"? - Sure. - Steam Cloud error. Wait. Oh, is it still? (Linus sighing disappointingly) I have no other controls. The only controls are... Also, I don't detect any audio. Definitely some things to fine-tune. - [Luke] But I mean, it's functioning. - Yes. And there's no fan noise, no heat output, in either the theater room or in the office upstairs. - [Luke] And input lag feels fantastic. - Well of course 'cause it's just an optical HDMI or an optical display port connection. There's no additional latency compared to just running a regular cable. - [Luke] What? - [Linus] Did you die, how'd you even die, did you kill yourself? - My own brambles, I guess? This is not going well for me. Oh. - [Linus] What is that? - [Luke] Nice hash switching. (Mark laughing loudly) - Oh my God. The stupidest part of this is the pool I'm mining into is like the lounge night lunch one. I think I'm just gonna stop. (Luke laughing amusingly) - Well realistically, you just need a keyboard mouse down here. - This is not a great experience. (Linus laughing gently) - [Luke] Can we even get back? - [Linus] I don't think we can get out of it. (Linus laughing amusingly) - If there's a Microsoft button? - Just like we can't get out of telling you about our sponsor! - Hey! (Luke laughing happily) - FreshBooks.

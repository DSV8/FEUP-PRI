    "transcript": "sup guys Eber with Hardware Canucks and I have a confession to me you see not that long ago I built myself a small form-factor PC featuring the Ryzen 9 3950x and an RTX 2080 T i all inside a swagger ITX chassis and I thought to myself this was gonna be my main workstation PC it is gonna replace my a7 and okay workstation I was all excited about it and I even mentioned in the video that this was gonna replace a main PC moving forward but let me show you what really happened well I'm still using the ATS 10 under K system guys and there's a good reason for that you see this beats C is dead silent under both idle and load operations and to me that's really important because what I'm doing my on cam compositions are my a roll I have the microphone placed sort of next to the case cuz when I'm composing my shot the camera is over there and then I sort of had the microphone placed as close as possible so that I get the best audio recording and the fan noise wasn't really interfering with the audio recordings because the system was just super quiet but when I replace it with the ITX case or the ITX system yeah the fan was just really bothering me it's difficult to explain it over video but let me show you a quick comparison between this and my ITX case so that's what I'm dealing with which is why I'm still using the 87 in a case system instead of the ITX system also I have a few other issues too first of invidious control panel doesn't show up on Windows even though that I've correctly installed the drivers directly through India's website so that is definitely something that I have to look into also I realize that I installed the radiator bracket on the top panel incorrectly because I plan on installing this handle because that's one of the cool things about this case is you can install handle on top for easier transportation so that's definitely something I want to fix as well that is more of a user error so that's that's completely my fault and I also want to take a look at the cable management and once again to see if I can kind of clean things up a little bit and finally there's the acrylic side panels because these things they look pretty disgusting they're very ugly and I mean they can easily scratch up so I do have a solution for that as well so in this video I'm going to try my very best to fix some of these issues with this ITX system faint noise is definitely top priority and the rest will sort of follow along all right so before I start playing wear out the fan profiles through software I do want to fix that radiator bracket at the top and of course take a look at cable management so take care of the physical stuff first and then we want to software at the very end all right so the top radiator bracket is installed correctly so now I can mount the handle without an issue except I actually don't have the screws to mount it properly because I can't seem to find them which is a complete fail on my part I did go through my screw pile to see if I can find something that works and the closest I found was this guy which is longer so I might have to hit up Home Depot to find something that's a bit shorter and then install it because I'm sure they'll be a solution for this but ya can't really find this group of that but at least I'm glad that this is done so the next order of business is to take care of cable management to see if I can sort of clean things up okay so I think I'm pretty happy with the cable management inside this case I tried my best to clean things up as you can see on this side it looks pretty good but let me know what you guys think about it in the comments if I flip over to the other side of the case you know one sec here yeah it looks pretty good I mean on this side cables are nicely routed and yeah the only thing is that Corsair cables the stock ones that come with this power supply they're a bit longer so what I'm gonna do perhaps later is get some custom cables and sleeve them myself make them a bit shorter so I don't have to worry about tucking them in but yeah that is that is what it is so the next thing to do is close this up but I will not be going back to the acrylic side panels in fact I did request likelier to send me the vented aluminum powder coated panels and they look absolutely gorgeous in fact I think they're even built a little bit better also this will definitely help with airflow for sure so I'm gonna mount this on this side so that I can see the GPU unfortunately the other side or the other panel is closed which means I won't be able to welcome that gorgeous or GB setup on the cooler as well as the memory so that's okay I mean this is an ITX chassis after all I don't really care about the RGB looks at all it's completely a matte black stealth looking build and that's exactly what I love about it all right so the system is booted and I'm right now fan noise unfortunately it's still present especially when I'm trying to browse anything through Chrome which is a fairly light low task it shouldn't technically ramp up but it still does and it's it gets pretty loud and the Nvidia control panel is still missing in the settings option as you can see right here when I right-click it's not there so I have to fix that and there is actually a good reason for that because Nvidia recently does not include the control panel as part of the driver package so if you download Nvidia drivers through Nvidia's website it is a company control panel because they've actually separated that which means you have to physically go into the Microsoft Store and download it from the Microsoft Store and interestingly enough if I look at the reviews on the store people absolutely hate this apparently it's broken people are having a lot of issues with this driver in fact they can't really install it so I don't know if it's gonna happen to me because it has a 1.5 rating which certainly isn't good so yeah before I do this I just want to make sure that windows is up to date so let me just go ahead and take care of that well it looks like we have a lot of things to update so I'll let the updates run and get back to you it's still loud so we're back windows is up-to-date I have to go through a few restarts to make sure all the updates are installed the fences are still ramping up Nvidia control panel is still missing so that is unfortunate it's also weird because Nvidia wasn't really clear about the fact that they were separating the control panel with their driver package if you're building a new system you would automatically assume then Nvidia as a whole would just include the control panel with the driver package because that's typically how it worked at least when I was building pcs last year it just happened recently that they managed to separate them so let's go ahead and install the control panel directly from the Microsoft Store because I guess the only option to get this sorted so let's see Nvidia control panel we're gonna go and man wish me luck I really hope that this works because the last thing I want is to have issues just installing the control panel of course you have to use your Microsoft account but I don't really want to it still should install without me signing in that's one thing I hate about the Microsoft storage all right so it's installed which is pretty fast actually but let's go ahead and launch this well what do you know it's up and running well that's a good sign it looks like I think we are running the updated version let me just double check so I have n tasty cam opened over here and as you can see it is running in these silent profile if I switch it to performance then the fans just they ramp up all the way to 12 1300 rpm but what's even interesting is that I did create a custom profile I play around the fan curves to see if I can find something that is relatively tolerable so it looks like my custom profile did work with these fans well guys I think I found the culprit that was causing fan noise and initially I thought it was a GPU fence but that wasn't the case in fact it was D be quite fans installed as intake at the bottom now how did I find that well I did something that none of you are supposed to do is just I simply place my fingers on these fans I let them stop spinning but that wasn't clear the fan so I sort of played around with the fans an installment waiter these things are super quiet so is the GPU but as soon as I laid my face on me be quite fans yeah the system is just dead silent I can't hear a single thing even the GPU and the red or the fans at the top so yeah it it works so what I'm gonna do is head into the BIOS and then play around with the fan RPMs because these fans at the bottom are connected directly to the motherboard so I should be able to fill around with the RPM value through the BIOS let's see how that goes well after spending a while figuring out the fan noise especially with the bottom fans the system is finally quiet it's actually dead silent just as the fractal case or my Intel system which is awesome now how did I do that well believe it or not I just installed AI suite 3 and I hit the silent profile and bam the system just just it just it just was super silent now if I want full speed I I can just hit that and the fans will ramp up that is pretty sweet man AI suite 3 it still looks pretty old I find remember this still looks like the one from the x79 deluxe days especially when I built my very first system ai suite looked very much the same so I think I've addressed all the issues with this ITX system guys the last thing I need to do is transfer all the files and programs from my Intel system to the ITX rig and replace this with with this beauty now before I sign off I do want to mention a few things if you're in the same situation as I am troubleshooting fan noise in your system so finding the culprit can be a little bit challenging especially if you're working in an ITX case where the fans are very much closer to each other I would highly not recommend placing your finger through the blades or putting them in the blades because like that could technically void the warranty of your fans it could damage the bearings I just did it because I thought it would be fun but I would highly not encourage doing that what you want to do is probably play around with the BIOS and see what you can do with the individual chassis fans especially if you have them connected to the motherboard now in this case I'm using the kraken X 62 cooler and fan speeds can only be controlled through camp unfortunately it cannot be controlled via BIOS because the kraken cooler it connects via a USB 2.0 header and it uses that interface to control the pump speed and all that stuff so that is something to encounter if you plan on using an e io solution if it's a CPU air cooler than it should be a problem you can control arguments directly for the bios the other thing i want to mention is that if your motherboard comes with a dedicated utility software that can control fan speeds and basically a hub like AI suite 3 for a soos highly recommend downloading it and playing around with that could definitely help you set custom fan profiles for individual jassi's and to me I'm actually really happy that I have that because I didn't realize yes we'd would completely sort of solved the issue with the be quite fence at the bottom because ultimately those two 140 millimeter fans were the culprit of a system noise so I'm glad that I was able to address that but other than that I'm pretty happy with the system guys I mean I managed to pretty much address all the issues that I had with this PC so the first step I installed reinstalled the bracket for the top panel properly but unfortunately I couldn't find the screws with a handle so I have to definitely hit a poem depot probably after I finished recording this video also I managed to replace the side panels the acrylic side panels with proper vented panels especially on the GPU also we fixed the Nvidia control panel issue that wasn't too bad if I'm pretty surprised that it just worked after I installed it directly from the Microsoft Store and then finally we we took care of fan noise so I'm very happy about that I just have to now edit this video on system it's actually the very first video that I'm editing on the species so I'm pretty sure it'll do a pretty good job at that but let me know what you guys think about these maintenance style vlog videos I mean are you interested in something like this definitely curious to know I'm Bieber with Hunter Canucks thank you so much for watching make sure to check out some relevant content over here subscribe hit that notification bell and I'll talk to you guys in the next one alright now I have to edit the video let's do this buddy let's do this",

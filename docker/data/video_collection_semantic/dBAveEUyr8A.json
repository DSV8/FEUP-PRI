    "transcript": "- If you're buying an Xbox Series X, a PS5 or an RTX 3080, then to get the most out of them, you need to do a much bigger upgrade. The display, the cables you're using, all of that has to be optimized. Otherwise, you're just simply leaving performance on the table. Here's the deal. All of these devices are taking advantage of HDMI 2.1. Now, this looks exactly like the HDMI that we all know and love. However, it functionally is very different. Not only in just the cables, which even though when you look at them, they look basically the same but importantly the displays that you connect them to are also different. So sit down and give me a few minutes to explain why if you are going to be upgrading, you really do need to consider having a much bigger upgrade across the board. So to give you an example, this is something that you would think would actually be capable of getting the most out of the Xbox. While it's a 1080p gaming display importantly it will run all the way up to 144 hertz provided you're connected to a PC. The thing is though not all of these things are created equal because you really need to take advantage of HDMI 2.1 to get the best out of something like this. So I hop into the settings here really quick. What you'll see is when I go to try change my resolution obviously 1080p is the max but I don't have 120 hertz. I don't have 4K. I don't have any of these things. The console's are capable. But most displays are just simply not set up to take a such a high quality high bandwidth signal from a device over HDMI right? Theoretically, the cables and everything here should be able to do 1080p 120. And as you'll see later, some devices and some TVs will do that, right? But it is all very, very confusing. So what do we need to be able to play at 4K and 120 frames per second? Well, I'm glad you didn't ask that because I happen to have what I was able to find as the cheapest, oh classic. The cheapest HDMI 2.1 device I could find. So this is the LG 85 series NanoCell TV. And as I was recording this video of course, this stuff is going to evolve very quickly. since you're watching this later, things may change. But as of recording this right now this is the cheapest display that should be capable of 4K and 120 FPS. And that's not even getting into all the other features that this console support including HDR including auto latency mode, including FreeSync. So this is what you want to look for, HDMI 4K at 120 hertz. So with this TV specifically has four HDMI ports, two of which are rated for the Xbox and the PlayStation in your PC. The problem is unless you're ready to unbox the TV and look for what it says on the port. It's kind of hard to actually know what really supports this. So now we have not only 4K is an option but if I open it up, I can bump up to 120 frames per second. Now with 120 frames per second you're getting double the amount of frames depending on the game and therefore double the smoothness. So if I wanted to play a game like DIRT 5, I would get that full experience. One thing though to note, you'll see 4K 120 requires an ultra high-speed HDMI cable included with Series X. So I am using the cable that comes with a Series X, but you can't just use any HDMI cable. You need to make sure that it is 2.1 and some cables say they are and they actually aren't, a good way to test is to see if it's thick. Cause all of these 2.1 cables are much thicker than a standard cable, but if you use the one that comes through your Xbox and I assume PS5, you should be fine. But the thing is, there's still more to it than this right? Because yes, we technically have a working set up here, but there are other TVs that either do or don't have 120 support. And there's some TVs that will run at 1080p or 4K and actually figuring out what works. You don't want to just buy this model of TV that I've tested can get really complicated. So there are a few things you should look for when it comes time to actually purchasing a TV or a monitor that you plan to use with the Xbox, with the PlayStation or to something like a 3080, if you wanna go over HDMI. First of all, HDMI 2.1 but that's just the beginning cause you also need to support a full 4K 120. A lot of devices will technically support 120 but maybe it's something like 1080p. But then there are things like FreeSync. Does it support a variable refresh rate? Does it support auto low-latency mode? These are all things that can make a big difference in your gaming experience Cause it's not just about purely being able to play the game at 120. You also wanna make sure that you do that with say no torn frames. You wanna make sure that you get an HDR. There's a lot of stuff that goes into this and certainly not all TV's that you purchase right now are going to support it. But I will say once you get it all up and running, this is a very, very nice looking experience. And mind you all of this will work on pretty much any HDMI display right? Like that's not a huge problem, but if you wanna get the most out of it, and honestly a lot of these games, you do need to have stuff like 120 FPS because I'll say like DIRT looks nice. But if I wasn't running at 120 FPS right now I could probably be playing on like a One X and I wouldn't really notice the difference. So to really get the most out of these PS5 and the Xbox Series X and those Series S having that full high refresh rate is a big deal. So to make things even more complicated. Some TVs will have a hybrid approach to supporting something like a PS5 or Series X. So this is a 2019 65 inch Vizio. Now if I hop into the settings, what you'll see is we see immediately 1080p and 120 FPS as an option. That's great. I think in a lot of scenarios, what I would like to do, is play at 4K for games that don't support anything higher but if something like DIRT has a 120 FPS option I'll just slip my TV over into 120 hertz mode. Now there is another option which is to switch over to 4K. Now by default, this is going to drop me down to 60 frames per second, which you getting from most games is going to be fine. But as actually, I just pass came through it. Even though it says 120 hertz is an option at 4K. As soon as I do that, the TV and specifically the Xbox realizes that that's not smart idea. Yeah, this refresh rate isn't supported with the resolution. So you said to the highest resolution by this display with the frame rate. So essentially the Xbox specifically is smart enough to know what your TV can handle and the 4K TV details always tell you 4K 60 not 4K 120 but you can go up to native 1080p at 120 but just because you don't have a brand new HDMI 2.1 TV doesn't necessarily mean that you can't get 120 FPS game play. Mean I have to do a little bit of fiddling or lose a few pixels. But if it's me I would much rather play at 1080p 120 if the game supports it compared to 4K 60. So what happens when we plug the Xbox Series X into a 4K 120 gaming monitor? Well we should see the very least 4K, but now a different set of options will show up by actually jump in and out. So first of all 4K no brainer Right? However what I don't see if I open this up is any support for 120 frames per second. Now that makes sense because this is equipped with an HDMI 2.0 port not 2.1, which means that like a lot of TVs, for example, I can play games at 4K at 60 frames per second, but I can't get 120 frames per second out of it. So when it came time for us to build our ultimate next gen gaming setup, we end up going with an LG OLED specifically a 2020, 65 inch. Now one of the nice things is pretty much all of the 2019 and 2020 OLEDs do support 4K. They support 120 as well as stuff like the auto low latency mode and FreeSync and all that kind of stuff. But I think the real question here is once you know that you have the TV and you have your HDMI cable and everything is set, cool. But how easy is it to find a TV that will actually work? Spoiler alert really (oof) difficult. So say I want to find a TV that will work well with my brand new PS5. So I go on bestbuy.com. I want us to search for 4K TVs cause obviously I want 4K, a 70 inch Samsung 4K surely a 70 inch Samsung TV even though it's only $600, we'll support 120 FPS right? Oh wait, hold on. Motion enhancement technology motion rate 120. I mean, that sounds like what I need right? 120 clearly that's the actual move right? Well, I found one thing. I found our NanoCell when I searched that the NanoCell that we have across the hall all those are the 55 inch, but it's the same thing. We know that this one works - [Narrator 1] Right, we do. - Do you think it says anywhere 60 hertz, - 4K at 120 hertz. - So what you're saying right now is the only way to find out short of finding someone who answers the question who has the TV has tested it. A TV that is supporting the full spec what we're looking for right? We just tested it. HDMI 2.1 all the bells and whistles is to buy it and to try it. look, there will obviously be videos like this one. There will be articles that will tell you, Hey, look this is a great TV for PS5 or Series X or whatever the case is. And as time goes on, these TVs are going to become more and more popular. But as of right now it is a complete God oof disaster trying to find any of these TVs that work well with the consoles. Sure, you can just default to buy a very expensive high-end premium TV from a Samsung, from a Vizio from an LG, whatever the case is, it'll probably work. But if you wanna know for sure short of finding an article or a video of someone who's tested that specific feature it is really hard to commit to that, right? I cannot believe this is literally one of the only TVs that should do it. And it doesn't say it. I would never have known. So hang on a second. I'm coming back to that 70 inch right? Samsung talked a big game about the 120 motion rate. 120 motion rate is not the same as 120 FPS. A lot of these TVs will run at 120 or 240, but that's with motion smoothing. That's not the same thing as 120 true frames per second. I finally found it native refresh rates 60. I've read 120 about 100 times before I finally found this very technical article which finally tells me that actually what I really need to know is I could buy this from PS5 and I'm not getting what I'm hoping. Here's the deal. There are a lot of things going wrong here. I'll fully admit that these console's are brand new and a lot of TV companies and manufacturers and specific stores don't even really understand the differences and certainly haven't tested it right? But there is a fundamental issue with the fact that I'm on a manufactures website and I can't find what I'm looking for. I'm seeing their marketing stuff but that's not what actually I am looking for to make this TV do what I want it to do. Don't say that I'm having to go on these like sites that have done these super thorough tests of the TV to finally get the information it's been here on the bottom of making sure that 4K at 120 hertz is enabled right? That's not okay. Then you've got the TV and you're gonna miss out on the next three, four, five years of gaming, never experiencing that extra fluidity that the console that you've already purchased is capable of. Thank you very much for watching. Make sure you subscribe to the channel for more ranting and raving is all about the perils of the next generation of consoles. Until next time. Good luck trying to get the most out of your shiny new console.",

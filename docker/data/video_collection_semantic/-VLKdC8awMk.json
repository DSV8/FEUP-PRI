    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going Dave 2D here so Amazon reached out to me And they said hey Dave we'd like to partner with you to make a gift guide for tech under $100 and I said sure that sounds like a great idea But I didn't want to cover tech that was geared towards tech enthusiasts I wanted to do stuff that I would give to my family and my friends for the holidays and in front of me are four Relatively simple items that are tech related. They're for people that enjoy tech, but they're not super complicated. Okay, so first up We have the tile Pro combo pack these are some new tractors from tile They're basically tiny Bluetooth beacons and you can stick them on anything your wallet your purse your backpack your keys Basically anything that you want to keep track of through a location device This is perfect for it it can be something that you misplace once in a while like your keys And you can keep track of it Or it can be something a little more substantial like if you're traveling you can stick it in your luggage And if you're within 200 feet or so you can keep tabs on it And these new ones come in a nicer design than they did before they have better range and they're still super easy to set up Next up is the data traveler from Kingston, so this one looks like a simple USB key And it is it functions as a USB key when you want it to but if you'll notice it actually has a lightning connector So this plugs right into your iPhone And it allows you to offload and store Photos and videos and obviously you can use this device to transfer between your computer or your family and friends Or just use it as a backup device. It comes in a few sizes This one's 64 gigs and it holds a lot But it's a great gift for anyone who has an iPhone especially the older ones with smaller capacities But just anyone who has an iPhone who doesn't have access to a computer Or doesn't know how to use your computer to frequently backup their stuff It's a tiny device, and it gives you a lot of extra storage at a reasonable price. Okay, next up We have the Dymo mobile labeler And this thing is a Bluetooth label maker which might seem like a dorky gift at first because all it does is make labels But for the right person this thing is awesome for someone who's really organized or with likes to be organized and wants their stuff labelled And printed out it's so cool You're labeling jars storage boxes any kind of household stuff Or if you'd like to have organized cabling or storage Basically if you know someone who likes having stuff organized they're gonna enjoy this and this particular unit is Bluetooth enabled So there's no buttons and keyboards on this thing to complicate it. It's all done through an app on your phone You create the label in the app, and then you print it out remotely. It's super easy to use. Okay, last up we have the Amazon Echo Dot and this is probably the most techie device of all the things in here because it Can be used for some very advanced home automation and stuff, but for the people that aren't super techy This is a great hub for voice-activated music controls, or just as like a personal assistant. And it can even read out audio books from Audible. It's really easy to set up and super inexpensive. So that's basically it, four great gifts for people that aren't super tech savvy. All of this stuff is linked in the video description below. I hope you guys enjoyed this video. Thumbs if you liked it. Subs if you loved it. See you guys next time.

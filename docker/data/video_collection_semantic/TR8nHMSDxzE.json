    "transcript": "now according to AliExpress, this unassuming little package is the best selling gaming PC on the platform... Hmmmm.

an annual premium [Music] subscription now the system in this pack pack cost $170 Canadian dollar which kind of explains why it's the best selling gaming system on AliExpress but it doesn't explain the gaming part of it so um yeah let's open it up and have a [Music] look oh really I thought it was a massive PC so they're clearly very excited about its size because I mean it's all they have to talk about on the box there's nothing on this side on the back we do get some more Mini PC and then no information about what the specific one in this box is so we're going to have to fire it up to find out oh yeah let's open it up [Music] further wow that PC really is mini that's tiny and it doesn't weigh anything either but first let's have a look at the accessories that comes with W this system just needs a 2.5 amp power brick that is very low power and then as is often the case with these mini PCS we get a Vasa mount on it so that you can mount it to the back of your monitor and we get a short HDMI cable for that application it looks like a bootleg Max studio it is very plasticky but you can tell that it really wants to look like an Apple product even with how the ventilation is implemented in the base but I'm not mad you I to mind me some poverty Apple that is some real flimsy housing though now in terms of the front we have our power button which is kind of lame on the side it's got three HDMI ports which makes this really interesting for people who want to power a bunch of displays for as cheaply as possible and in an act of symmetry on the other side we have our USB 3 ports and on the back there's dual ethernet that's very interesting in terms of iio this is a fascinatingly set up Mini PC which definitely has use cases although going by the form factor I'm kind of assuming gaming isn't going to be one of them although we'll we'll find a way to turn this into a cool gaming experience later in the video wow this is a wildly terrible arcade peripheral now aside from its minute Dimensions another thing that makes this PC interesting is that it's got a Celeron n100 in it one of Intel's newer loser tier CPUs one that I've not tested before on the channel I'm very curious to see how it performs with its all ecore layout cuz maybe it is a gaming Beast now we'll find out soon enough but before we do that let's jump to the Future and crack open this Mini PC to see if it's inherited some other app traits opening up the little firebat seems relatively straightforward it seems like it's just these four screws one of which is hiding under a quality control sticker there we go oh and then aside from a tiny fan we just get some plastic Cod [Music] pie then pops off way more easily than this bit did and then under there we've got a very cute little motherboard which can also just slide out of the way under that oops oh that was the power button uh but under that we've got our Wi-Fi antenna and the little Coss battery and when you flip the mobo around it's clear Tim Cook didn't have his grubby little Ms on this system cuz we've got upgradable storage and under that is also a replaceable Wi-Fi card with that I think we can still go [Music] deeper that is such a cute little heat pipe with tiny heat sink next to that it does seem like we even have some contact with power delivery [Music] here we lift that off oo lots of thermal paste and that's what our chip endowed with four ecores looks like M what a beauty oh the other bit of cooling was touching some soldered down Ram as supposed to power delivery so at least Tim Cook approves of some of this design oh it's so cute and little get a little LED hey fire bat and here's our little bber mini PC running a remarkably clean install of Windows 11 not much VD to speak of let's quickly control alt delete in here and have a look up in our bent corner of our OLED panel and our little Celeron is already being choked out just running Windows that's a very good sign although that's probably due to update processes yeah it is Windows update suck in and dry so I'm going to leave it for a while so it can finish being brutal ized by windows and then we'll try the five most popular games on Steam at the moment on this system to see how it holds up is the gaming system that it very definitely is a while was an understatement the update processes took so long I died of old age waiting for it to finish but luckily baby doid can take over and test the gaming performance this is running at 1080p lowest settings with balanced Fidelity FX as you can see it's looking real balanced here lots of balance happening frame rate isn't looking great but quite frankly it is better than I was expecting this is borderline a usable experience I'm always surprised to see that CS2 seems to handle the depths of frame rate despair a lot better than CSG go ever did I'm not saying that you should be playing it with 10 frames per second and that you're going to be competitive online or whatever but there's less input lag maybe it also seems like the Bots are really punishing the little Celeron it's doing that fun thing where the CPU bottle makes its own igpu but that balance changes quite a lot as more Bots die but again despite the frame rate and the fact that Fidelity FX is doing most of the heavy lifting here so it looks pretty terrible but despite those things it's running quite a bit better than I was expecting those are also some fine temperatures so we've launched Dota 2 here just in the demo hero bit uh because I'm trying to remove Bots from the equation cuz that really tanks the CPU performance and I refuse to spend an hour playing against real people on this system but here at 1080p low settings with full render scale so it's it's rendering at 1080p this actually isn't too bad there's there's nothing really happening on screen but it's about 60 frames per second let's see what happens to the performance when we just Spam a bunch of [Music] spells yeah okay it's it's not it's not going great but we can still drop the render resolution I think we'll set it to 70 that's where it was by default I think even with the lower render resolution we've still got a bit of CPU Headroom ooh fancy so when we do that that okay this is still not doing great but it feels kind of borderline usable and this is a game that a lot of people play and I I'd say you can get away with using the system for it you're not going to be happy about it it's not going to be a good time for you but it's borderline usable so this is the third most popular game on Steam at the moment running at [Music] 1080p am I doing it right I think so and despite the very intense Graphics happening here we're getting 30 frames per second very playable for some banana clicking action what is this and why are 400,000 people doing it right now well after Googling it it turns out it's essentially an nft scan cool Destiny 2 took ages to get running it kept crashing initially for some reason but then I redownloaded the game on the little PC's SSD which fixed it because Destiny 2 is all worried about cheaters you can't have any overlays on it other than the steam one and I think as far as I read on the internet the Nvidia performance overlay also works but we don't have an Nvidia GPU so that gray 23 frames per second is going to be our best bet here unfortunately yes that's a lot better okay now we can actually see it oh this is looking so beautiful look at that detail looks like the metaverse up in here it's awesome so despite us getting about 30 frames per second with our 75% render resolution at 720p the game is kind of more more playable than I was [Music] expecting that's a very good start I wonder what resolution this is at it looks like it's running at 1440p which would explain the seizures we have to do 1080p even that's going to be a real struggle oh you always know you've got one hell of a gaming system when you load in midair being kicked out of the plane wow it is running like it's got lead poisoning this is not going great okay I think we're going to have to drop the render scale to 70 that's as low as it'll let us go okay that's helped a little bit now we're fully utilizing the system my lordy 100% GPU utilization and 100% CPU utilization that's some good teamwork right there but unfortunately teamwork very much did not make this dream work aside from the terrible visuals massive stutters low frame rate input lag there were also massive Network drops some of which lasted over a minute which made just not dying outside of the Zone a challenge in itself so this was running way more in line with what I was expecting now obviously this little system isn't designed to run pubg the only reason it's gone gaming in its product listing is because this seller was keyword baiting but I bought something else of the Val Express which may go very well with the kindor games the system should be able to run with very little problem emulation it's called the how pad and it's a control interface that should be awesome for classic gaming there's some instructions for it our how pad oh look at that it looks different to what I was expecting I was kind of expecting a joystick on it for some reason there's a tiny little LCD screen over there that's super cute and it's all kind of mounted in this acrylic plate uh all of the keys I don't know it sounds quite arcadey and then we've got our start buttons and stuff up here and included in the box is a square USB to type c cable it also comes with a little spare switch so that if one of them dies you can replace them that's quite a nice touch briefly looking at the manual it does all seem wildly unintuitive I don't know my eyes immediately started glazing over while reading this but I'm sure we can figure it out with that let's get it set up [Music] oh all the keys line up and then the little LCD over here tells you if the key inputs are being registered and then all there was left to do was download retro arch for some old school gaming action I'm going to blame the controls even though it's not its fault at all what is interesting is is that for left and right it can't register those two inputs at the same time which I guess isn't a huge issue I don't know why this is lay out in the way that it is because of the size of the buttons when you use your standard keyboard grip you have to reach for stuff which feels really uncomfortable and then the shoulder triggers are next to the normal Keys which I'm not sure how that's going to work for PlayStation gaming and whoever made it clearly hasn't learned their left from their right yet cuz I'm pretty sure that's the wrong way around now I'm sure a bunch of people are going to tell me that actually DAV the shape makes a lot of sense cuz it's modeled on the Super Nintendo famon Beast 64 controller from 1978 and actually the fact that you think that it doesn't feel good it's because you're stupid but this is a terrible layout even if it is originally based on a thing okay with that little Outburst out the way I will say the keys do have a nice arcade cabinet feeling to them although even in 2D platforming games like Mario I feel like a joystick would have worked way better for movement and unless you want to develop osteoporosis in your hands I wouldn't get anywhere near the shoulder trigger situation and then in terms of the Mini PC I ran up to PS1 games on it which had ran flawlessly so um yeah I guess that means you can game on it so with that what did we learn in today's video well these days anything's a gaming PC as long as you lower your standards enough which brings me to the end of the video thank you for watching subscribe to the channel if you enjoyed the video maybe watch another video suggestion will pop up in a second and until the next video bye-bye [Music]",

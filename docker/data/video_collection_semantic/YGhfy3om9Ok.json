    "transcript": "In my hand is the single scariest GPU in the world. This Chinese GPU is so threatening that it's got Biden flying around the world begging semiconductor manufacturers to stop working with China. Why? Well, because it's completely homegrown. From the shroud to the sand that makes the silicon, this is a Chinese product and it took only two years to create. Moore Threads has been extremely secretive about its development, but now that it's out of their testing lab, there's nothing to stop it from spreading around the world into my hands. Allow me to introduce then the brand new fourth player in the dedicated GPU space. But then if you consider that a behemoth company like Intel has had such a rocky road to bringing a GPU to market, how could this unproven underdog possibly hope to compete with the likes of Nvidia and AMD? They're gonna have to be fierce, almost as fierce as this segue to our sponsor. Build Redux. Looking to level up your gaming experience? Build Redux is here to help. They'll create a custom gaming PC that is tailored to the specs you set out while offering competitive pricing compared to building your own. Follow the link below and start building your dream gaming rig today. Moore Threads first showed up on our radar in 2021. And since then, they've gone from fledgling startup to raising a total of half a billion US dollars and no fewer than five SKUs listed on their website. Absolutely wild. But also not as unexpected as you might initially think. You see, they're helmed by James Zhang, who previously was VP and general manager of Nvidia's Chinese division. And they're funded by, you guessed it, the CCP. So when we learned that they had finally launched their first gaming GPU, we had to get one. Except we couldn't. Unsurprisingly, as members of the Western media, Moore Threads was completely uninterested in returning our calls. And the first wave of GPUs that they released to customers were only available for those who managed to get their hands on a purchase code through a lottery system, kind of OnePlus style. Thankfully, we were able to find one such individual who was willing to send us the GPU to take a look at. Thanks, pal. Okay, the script just says unbox. Is there anything interesting? Ah, well, this is interesting. Rather than use a standard PCIe power connector, Moore Threads has an adapter that appears to go from dual PCIe 8-pin to 8-pin EPS, which is the connector that you would normally use for a motherboard, not for a GPU. This is something we've seen before on server GPUs, but not really on gaming ones. Whether it's due to the aluminum shroud or the relatively wide spacing of the heat sink fins, it feels kind of light compared to a modern top tier card, like a 7900XTX. It's rated for 255 watts total board power, though, so depending on the performance per watt, it could end up within spitting distance in games. That 255-watt TDP could also help explain our 8-pin CPU connector. This guy is rated at 300 watts compared to the 150 watts of an 8-pin PCIe connector, though there are other strategies for that, like putting dual PCIe 8-pins on it. The more likely possibility is that this is pretty much the same thing as their new server GPU, the MTTS3000, that happens to have the same number of compute cores, clocked slightly higher, and twice as much RAM, just with a gaming-oriented shroud on it. In servers, PCIe-based cards like Nvidia's Tesla, now known as data center GPUs, commonly use EPS power connectors for a couple of reasons. First and foremost, it's faster to plug in one cable than two, and also because the EPS 12-volt connector was established by SSI, or the Server System Infrastructure Forum, way back before PCIe power connectors even existed, and it's just kind of never really gone away. What makes this gaming, then? Honestly, not much. It's got a triple fan shroud compared to the blower style that you would normally find in server or workstation cards, and ample display outputs. This is three DisplayPort 1.4s and an HDMI 2.1, making it extremely modern. And that's not the only way it's modern. This is the first GPU with a PCIe Gen 5 by 16 interface. That's right, they beat Nvidia, AMD, and Intel to the punch. It's got 16 gigs of GDDR6 memory, 4,096 MUSA compute cores clocked at 1.8 gigahertz, giving it 14.4 teraflops of FP32 compute power. Hmm, so maybe not trading blows with the 7900 XTX? That would put it between an RTX 3060 and a 3060 Ti in terms of raw performance, which is sort of disappointing. I mean, I thought this thing was supposed to be scary, right? Adding to its modernness, it supports VP9, H.264, H.265, and apparently AV1 encoding, and that 16 gigs of memory is connected over a 256-bit memory bus, giving it about the same maximum memory bandwidth as a 3060 Ti, though with twice the amount of RAM, which again, could belie its server heritage. The GPU at its heart is apparently based on their chun xiao architecture. Andy's not here to help me with the pronunciation though, so that could be way off. This feels so naughty as a member of the hated Western media. I'm not supposed to be playing with this thing, at least not yet. Ooh, it does have RGB. It's kind of pretty. Oh, right. And it has AI cores as well, kind of like Nvidia's Tensor cores, though exactly what we can do with them, we're not sure yet. These Chinese GPUs are making me thirsty. It was a good time. lttstore.com. That's it, it's up. I don't know why, but I expected this to require a little bit more faffing about. Well, there was some minor faffage before you came here. I don't know why I'm so surprised. I mean, obviously if it didn't display a Windows desktop, they wouldn't ship the thing, you'd think, right? But it just works at 120 Hertz. It only actually supports 17 motherboards total. They actually only sell it in a bundle because they're so worried about people buying the card and then not being able to run it. So we tried it in other boards and it just, it's not a validation thing. It just doesn't, it doesn't appear. So we were very thankful that we had one in stock of the ones that they supported. Does it support HDR? There does not appear to be any HDR support. It's not in English. I think I can infer a lot of this though. GPU clock, GPU usage, GPU temperature. It's quiet, ish. I just immediately want to go off road. Okay, I lied. I want to fire an OBS. What's AOM AV1? I've only got SVTAV1 and AOM AV1. Well, I've got X264, but that's CPU. I guess typically it would show like Nvidia NVENC or something. Yeah. Or Intel AV1. Well here, we'll see if the usage goes up. Okay, well the encoder's there, but it's not supported at least by OBS at this time. This might actually have screen cap in it. I know it has overlays. Let's control alt A. I saw a yellow thing flash up. I wonder if that was screen recording. Okay, well we know what that is. That's gaming overlay or whatever. Screen shot. Oh. If you hold it down, it's basically a screen cap. Okay, so I need to learn to game. Let's get into a game. What game do you want to play? I want to play League of Legends. Really? You do? Well, I just assume that this is going to be a beast for League of Legends, because that's like the most popular game in China. Yeah. Do you want to try anything more modern? Like Shadow of the Tomb Raider is a good place to start. Everything runs on Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Sure. It's good we don't have Doom Eternal because the demons are Chinese demons, so we couldnt show them. Really? Okay. Oh, shut up. No support for DirectX 12. My resolution dropdown has very few options. I guess we'll go with 4K. Oh, I wonder if their scaler sucks. And my monitor refresh rate options are super weird. 24. Okay. 30. Yeah. 60. Sure thing. 82. What are these refresh rates? Ooh. See, it can barely even render this box. My first Moore Threads gaming experience. Oh, this is... Okay, I can tell from your face. This is as far as it goes, isn't it? Yeah. Oh, it's completely locked up. Did it die die? Here's the situation. Aside from supporting only 17 motherboards, it also only supports DirectX 9 games with some DirectX 11 games. And this is in large part thanks to its lack of tessellation support. I mean, it booted really fast. They actually just added 23 more games. Back to my initial instinct then. Can we fire up League of Legends? Yes. Oh my God, there's an update. While you're doing that, we'll compare it to this other system we have. Oh, right. There's a second system here. I assume that has a like RTX 3060 in it. That would be the spec for spec comparable. It's a 1660. Oh. It's price comparable though. Okay. Well, that gives me a different set of expectations with respect to performance, but then already it didn't run the first game we tried to run. Look at all the things in this stupid dashboard that are not play the game. Start Your Legend is not it. Play League is not it. The game is temporarily unavailable. Okay, am I an idiot or? I actually, I don't know either. I don't know how to get this to open. Play Dota, the superior MOBA. Okay. Can we put the gaming overlay up? Control, alt, X. No. Windows keys not working? Control, alt, delete. Hey, there we go. How dare you? It is totally control, alt, X. Okay. Probably the game doesn't allow you to have overlays. Oh, anti-cheats. I mean, it's smooth. I really wish I had an FPS counter right now, but it's working. It's at medium. Okay. I'm setting it to very high. Still working, still smooth. How's your experience on it? Great, actually. I'm getting over a hundred frames per second, boys. At 4K? At 4K. Everything maxed out. I don't think it's that hard to run, League. I'm gonna get dead. Press F. But I don't wanna pay respects. No, it heals you, I think. Look, I don't play this game, all right? So there's things called creeps. There's like, I know how the game fundamentally works. There's more than one enemy hero that I have to fight. It's stupid. It's a team game. Not only is this running, but it's been rock solid. I don't see any graphical anomalies, and it's actually really quiet. All right. Time for some Counter-Strike. What are your settings? I'll just go through and make sure they're the same. The game just crashed, so cool. And maybe you should get a Moore Threads GPU. You'd have more luck. Interesting fact that I learned is that the bots are controlled by the GPU. So having bots actually affects your GPU results. I thought they were CPU. Maybe that's why they're so dumb. I get killed by bots a lot in CSGO. All right, you're playing Counter-Terrorist? Ooh. This is not good. That says 30 FPS, but these frame times are extremely inconsistent. Yeah, it's pretty smooth for me. I'm between like 160 to 200. Yeah, try looking at the ground. There you go. Look at all those frames. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Dang it. I have to imagine that it's probably not designed with 4K in mind. With that said, if you have 16 gigs of VRAM and a high performance GPU, it's not a big stretch to say, oh, well, it performs well at 1080p. It should also perform well at 4K. I'm gonna try switching to 1080. Wait, I can't. Remember my resolution drop down was borked in other stuff? Well, I brought another monitor out for you. Oh my God, really? Okay. Well, let's at least set it. Oh, and I can't even set it above 60. Wait, why can't it go above 60? This monitor can almost certainly do at least 120 over HDMI. Yeah, let's try DP. You nuked it. Monitor's doing stuff. But it's having to think. Yay, there we go. It's not a good sign for your product that we're excited that it turns on at all. 120 FPS on a two dimensional splash screen. The smoothness of the frame delivery is better. What I suspect is that they basically just didn't test it at 4K at all. This is a smooth 50 FPS, whereas that was a dog crap 2530. The rough performance of this GPU kind of sits around the GT 1030, which is a 30 watt card. This card pulls about 250 watts. GT 1030 is also $80. Yeah, Moore Threads, more like less frames. There it is. I got 300 FPS for a second there. Wow, I'm at 90 right now in the tunnel? Yeah, so it's the bots. Interesting. The hard part about making a CPU is that you're trying to make hardware that can do everything. The hard part about making a GPU, you're trying to make hardware that matches these already established standards. So you know what your hardware is gonna do, but getting it to cooperate? Very challenging. I was getting like 400 frames per second in the tutorial for a second there. Then this guy shows up. I dropped down to 130. I was so happy with my 300 to 400 FPS. He's getting a thousand. Okay, what settings are you running at? What settings are you running at? Okay, I'm at very high. Oh, let me set that. I still have a thousand. Once again, I'm at an eighth of the performance with double the power consumption. It runs the game. I mean, that's impressive. It's better than I could do. Team Fortress 2, let's go. I wanna see if it glitches. That's all I need to know. I know, it used to be so good. It started going downhill for me when they started having different levels and stuff. Yeah, it was flawlessly balanced. There was some pretty bad balancing, especially at the start. And I think that- You're a fanboy. I'm not a fanboy. It's actually legitimately so fair. And it's because of the size of the teams that allows for kind of offside battles as well as the sheer variety of weapon combinations makes it so that there's no- Oh my God, you write a little poem about it. Dude, I probably have already. It's obviously not getting the kind of performance that I would get out of a base tier Nvidia GPU, but I'm anywhere from 70 to 100 FPS, even in a firefight. That's not great. That's playable. Look. Now, when we tried games that were not on the supported list, was it just universally not compatible? Like Factorio, is that supported? Nope. But you get a lot of these. They're making driver checks and calls at the start and they'll just be like, nope. So it's fairly crap then. Yeah, it's basically garbage. I mean, I couldn't build one, but then I haven't likely stolen a bunch of IP from Nvidia. Took them two years to make a GPU and you three years to make a screwdriver. Yeah, thanks for that, Adam. That's really helpful. Oh, here we go. Wow, interesting. They went and they created a custom connector here so that they can carry all of these PWM signals and 12 volt power to the fans separately. This eight pin EPS power connector passes through to a four pin. Does it even actually draw 250 watts or whatever it's rated for? We saw it drawing 250. Oh. But they're actually doing it through a four pin plus the 75 watts from the slot, okay. All the VRMs are along the top edge of the board. I don't think I've ever seen that before. It's a little like grounding tab for the cooler. Samsung memory chips. I mean, they're labeled Samsung. It's definitely a Moore Threads die though. What a curious product. On the one hand, it supports the latest standards, but on the other hand, it barely works, you know? If you were wondering if there's any merit to it outside of gaming, unfortunately we weren't able to test AI. Maybe that's part of their play since right now China's having a hard time getting their hands on powerful AI accelerators, but if the AI performance is anything like productivity performance, let's just say the lack of a seven day no questions asked return policy is not a big surprise to us. So why is it bad? Unlike CPUs, there are very few options for open or licensable GPU architectures. The biggest players all like to keep their secret sauce firmly in their satchel, meaning that Moore Threads had to design their architecture from the ground up or well, I mean, they probably didn't. Even if you possess considerable knowledge and funding, making your own architecture, iterating on that, putting it into a board and shipping it could easily take 10 years, let alone two. And this is just their first consumer GPU. Moore Threads have already released several enterprise GPUs, meaning something is amiss here. And that's where we got to kind of pull the sheets off of China's big secret. This isn't quite a fully Chinese GPU. Korean tech channel Bullslab did some digging and noticed that the company actually licensed IP from Imagination Technologies, the company that owns the power VR architecture. You might've heard from them from when they helped make GPUs for Apple in the days of the early iPhones and iPads. Now, lots of companies license IP from others. I mean, all of Apple's impressive M series chips are based on ARM, but they also don't claim to be all American chips, except technically Imagination Technologies is owned by Canyon Bridge Capital Partners who are in turn funded by the Chinese central government, making this, well, technically a Chinese GPU. Now, China understands the disadvantages of needing to lean on the rest of the world for their chips. That's why the Chinese government announced they were investing $1.4 trillion into tech in 2020, making Biden's government's $53 billion chips act look like walking around money. And while Moore Threads is the most prominent player that we've seen, at least over here in the West, China's not putting all their eggs in one basket and actually has numerous GPU projects and companies on the go. So then, does this mean we're gonna see ripping fast Chinese GPUs in just a couple more years? Probably not. I mean, first off, tensions between China and the US are pretty high right now. We've seen the Huawei ban, a potential TikTok ban, and Joey B cracking down on Chinese access to Western designed GPUs from the likes of Nvidia, not to mention important semiconductor IP. So there is a chance that these GPUs may actually never end up being sold in North America, though that could be a bit of an advantage for them because it would mean that there was that big leak of Nvidia IP a little while back. They could utilize some of the things they found without worrying about any kind of import restrictions. On top of that, the Chinese government seems more interested in limiting gaming performance than investing in gaming hardware. So it's likely that this is more of an AI play than a gaming play. Nothing is for certain though right now, except that this card totally sucks. And even if you have access to it, you shouldn't buy it.

    "transcript": "hello and welcome to This Is. Austin. wait no no no no Austin had to go do stuff like I don't know have a kid or something so I brought in Ken and we're gonna talk about what's in our everyday carries I feel like that's the only time I'm ever on this pretty much because uh because well I would have this conversation with Austin first of all every every time you talk to him he's just like what's in your bag Austin oh let me show you about the z-flips I don't want I don't care yeah so we had this conversation like a year ago at this point and I feel like we have switched because when we have this conversation I was well I mean I still am like a weird I'm like a step away from getting the bomb shelter in my backyard all I'm missing is the backyard but I've really changed the way I have my everyday carry and I feel like you've changed the way you have your everyday yeah I feel like in the year that I've done danky so far my priorities have kind of changed a little bit but I think priorities for you have changed ever since uh you gave me a little bit of a sneak peek but yeah your situation in terms of the device that you carry is different I want to show you what like I used to carry around I used to have this bad boy oh heavy which is Dent is this your Vape no it's not my vape because uh wait Vape but this is just a nice little adapter thingy a bunch of slots for SIM cards for micro SD cards so this is just a very nice utility thing if you're carrying a lot of media if you're like a photographer or maybe you have a lot of phones that need to hop like SD cards so this was just cool to have it's really lightweight I don't know if I'm gonna carry this around I haven't really used it all that much I have Thunderbolt cables I have uh USBC cables I have headphones I have a thunderbolt 2 adapter who the [__] still uses Thunderbolt I have a second Thunderbolts the only scenario where I can see you needing all of this is if you have friends that need this stuff but do you even have that many friends I was doing all of this when I was like working on the more like film sets I was a dit for a while I needed a lot of connectivity for different devices a couple different uh Power bricks and stuff like that so like this got really heavy so I was carrying around this with me every day and I hated that and I also used to carry around my MacBook The Good Old Reliable and the key word here is I used to I want to show you my bag I want I want you to show me your bag sure so I actually got sent this out from bellroy this is the Tokyo tote people from there love their tote bags and I also needed a backpack so it is the best of both worlds has a handle on top it's a little heavy right now because I have this configured for both everyday and for travel I'm actually making a denki video specifically on the Travel portion but my everyday carry is not too far off first of all one of my favorite things is right like if I'm taking this backpack out to like a restaurant or if I'm just carrying around with me every day I have this little hook but I like carrying around so this allows me to hang the bag pretty much anywhere with a table surface I don't have the arm strength look at how heavy that bag is it's not heavy like this every day because this has my whole entire kit in here my camera my Sony fx3 also got batteries mics my laptop I got my wallet got a nice little cable bag much like yours only a little smaller maybe a little fatter I'm looking at how hard it is for you to get stuff out of this bag too look when I get to my destination this is not being this is not with me all the time but this is where my camera kit is and I also have my laptop to see what's in this thing um was that Legos it's actually just Advil and uh and allergy meds this bag has a lot of stuff that I need on a regular basis and maybe a few of the things that I might need in edge cases for example I have a thunderbolt 4 drive that's like I think this is two terabytes I also have a bunch of cables I think you have this don't you I do so our friends over at deity when we saw them they gave us these Nifty little pouches and it's like my new favorite thing I know there's a lot of people who love like the like the super chunky cables I hate that so much like it just to me that's so cumbersome so cool though look at it it matches my play day okay okay none of my stuff is color coordinated yeah you're gonna find a lot of my stuff is white just because it's Apple stuff what is it but like throwing it off though is the Razer power brick can do I think 130 Watts total can charge the MacBook at full speed I also have a Walkman yeah it's Charming obviously has a has a headphone jack on the bottom does all the nice Bluetooth goodies has micro SD so if you store a lot of music which not many people own their music at this point the thing is that like ever since I've been doing danky and I have an editor now Luke who's awesome and it's helping me with a lot of stuff but up until this point I've needed to have a lot of this stuff on me to be ready for any denki shoot that I come across especially when I'm on the go I don't do any of that I have my camera kit in here as I mentioned earlier got the Sony fx3 bam got a battery case in here that charges me a USBC oh I also have a z-fold for my Shark geek what is this A Shard geek storm 2. you can see through it it has a screen to tell you all the outputs and stuff it is a very handy little device I can't stress enough that this is the exact opposite of what we went through last year because last year I was minimalist I was like I'm not taking anything and it had like a Z flip and that's it now I have the kitchen sink and everything else in the kitchen okay but this is the last cool thing though this is a DJI microphone set this DJI set looks like air pods but they're little microphones and you can clip onto your shirt and stuff to record audio all right let me ask you though what's in your pocket an iPhone 14 pro Max oh and I also have um I have an apple card I carry around iPhone uh 14 pro which I don't like I want my mini back so I got some air pods yeah of course naturally I got my keys I get more into the much more you're the guy that I get stuck behind at the airport I used to carry around like a big multi-tool so this is a gerber it's got a knife it's got a screwdriver oh it has little things too it has like a little itty bitty knife the weight I have carrying around with me which is already just astronomical because I mean look at me just having the weight in my pockets reduced was big when I travel around my everyday carry I'm like I like to carry my backpack everywhere he's gonna cut my hair I like to carry my backpack around everywhere and I'm like oh man like this is actually like starting to hurt my like my shoulders my back if I'm carrying this round especially at like trade shows we recently went to NAB and CES and like your pack got progressively lighter the longer we stayed in Vegas because I'm like I don't want to carry this around I just nuked everything and started from scratch and I'm so much more happy so the bag I have is the same so I've had this bag forever it's nothing special but it just works for me really well I got my little uh Lego Space patch whatever so I have a pair of Mechanics Work Work gloves which I gotta replace I've seen better days yeah they're they got a lot of holes in them I got to replace them wow I have a very bright flashlight let me show you what I actually keep around here because it's not much my laptop sleeve empty because I need my laptop less and less now that um I'm not making thumbnails so what what am I using instead of uh instead of the MacBook is an iPad Mini hey yo I love these things so I have been able to replace pretty much everything in my workflow with an iPad Mini all the stuff I do for YouTube has like two three weeks whatever if I've done it all on on the mini I have gone through a handful of cases for this this case here again is nothing special I just kind of like that it look like a moleskin notebook what I like to do and Kinsey gets mad at me for this is uh this fits in my back pocket so like I've been walking around the office with this just in like out of my pocket my only regret because this is only a 64 gig model yeah I got this for super cheap the only regret I have is that I didn't get the cellular version of this yeah my last iPad did have cellular I like that now my backpack is set up in a way that it's modular so it's like if I'm going on like a shoot I'll bring that extra uh bag absolutely yeah but I have plenty of room in there so here's what I got the rest of it so I have my little pouch of deity cables which is just all the charges I need throughout the day a charger for the watch I'm not wearing right now all right so my phone my iPad and then my uh your my watch so those all go there as far as charging goes I've gotten rid of bricks and I just use this single it's a gan Prime uh charging block I love this thing so yeah watch I need to get one of these it's super lightweight it's got two a ports 2C this can do a 100 watt power delivery it's an extension cord as well if I need it you know if I'm in a hotel plug this in I got everything I need I know that this is not the best product in the world but the way I use it I really like I think I have tried every magsafe battery um I have the anchor one I have like I have all of them this is fine it's not great it can't even charge the full the full thing which I understand is a No-No for some people but the way I use it that's okay so when I get to a hotel room instead of charging my phone with this lightning cable I charge the battery yeah and then uh throw this on the uh the magsafe charger like that so it's charging both of them overnight so you actually can have more power in the day if you need it yeah or you could just buy a pro Max and have more battery and a bigger screen but you're carrying two uh that I could cut this in half I got my Shark geek yeah buddy yeah I'm gonna put this over here so you can't take it and then the only other thing I have in my bag I do carry around this is the one piece of production gear that I carry around with me so this is just a a little brick light that's got a magnet on it it's fully diffused right the LEDs are literally behind here there's uh what there's 12 in there talking about like my my prepper type of things yeah having a a light like this like oh like God forbid we're stuck in the dark or whatever the battery on this even though this one is dead right now is still it lasts a long time so I do have a couple other things um I have what I call my my Apple alternative uh pouch so I have my uh surface Duo and I really hate using airpods with the surface Duo they just it just doesn't work with Android that well so I do carry around a second pair of I got Samsung uh the cheap link but I actually I actually do the same I don't have them on me right now but I normally carry around airpods Pro 2 as well but I have Sony linkbuds S which have my favorite uh non-apple earbuds the actual last thing he goes with me everywhere oh I know what this is it's the little Martian this is uh Jeremy my Martian anyone who's ever gone to RIT and had a class with one of the professors Carl at the end of the class he hands out these little martians he has this like this big bag of them and so this is just like a weird little fraternity of people who have had this uh this little martian I have mine on my desk at home too he goes with me everywhere for the past uh about 10 years now a lot of people don't really know that about us like we went to the same school Matt was actually my professor which is kind of funny how that worked out yeah I mean you used to say you're my boss but now we are equal footings yeah suck it Ken but like my pile here is much smaller than you okay okay ignoring the camera that I'm gonna take for traveling my everyday care barring the camera camera still putting stuff away barring the the camera things this all fits in here look at this look at this it's small and look how much he has to put away the big question is like all right if I'm having some so little why don't I get a smaller bag uh the idea is because I don't want to switch bags not just like I don't want to switch bags in general I don't want to switch bags if I need to carry something extra so if I am going on a shoe if I am going traveling this bag here what I can fit in this bag about three days worth of of extra clothes so like I could easily fit that in this uh in this bag now so I don't have to take a suitcase or another bag with me if I travel I like having that flexibility and then again like if I'm going to like a trade show they love to give out swag oh yeah so the amount of times we had to throw away swag because we don't have room in our bags but you have all the I have all the room in the bag okay so like I like having just a big bag of a lot of space if I accumulate objects throughout the day sure I have a place to put them I'm very happy with this setup it's super easy to manage I don't I don't feel like I have to charge a thousand things that's my compromise with this bag is um I am down to the wire with it I might have a little extra space for maybe like an umbrella or a water bottle but um other than that there isn't a lot of room for anything else which is why usually when I go out somewhere I usually have to bring like a little extra thing which is why I win this one so Five Points the match ding ding let us know what is in your everyday carry let us know who has the better everyday carry it's me let us know when uh you're gonna go watch uh danky's actual everyday carry video check him out over there like follow subscribe and we'll catch you in the next one",

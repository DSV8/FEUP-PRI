    "description": "The Lian Li Lancool II Mesh case is the airflow focused follow up to the original Lancool 2.  After benchmarking to testing temperatures with air cooling, this might be one of the best gaming cases of 2020 since it has a good price and plenty of water cooling options too.

    "transcript": "Hey would you look at that a case born to push limit funny thing how the Lancoool II Mesh is launching in the same week just two days apart from the P50A from Phanteks definitely not a coincidence or maybe not Adam I saved one peel for you guys that's almost too smooth one more so this my good people is the land called to mesh a very promising mesh treatment upgrade of the original Lancool 2 which was fantastic feature wise but lacked in the airflow Department so this supposed to remedy that make sure to check out our original line code to review because the guts are basically identical with a few minor modifications that I'll go over so let's review the very promising Lancool II Mesh right after this the razor Viper ultimate the lightest and fastest wireless mouse designed for eSports with an accurate focus plus 20k dpi optical sensor raise your hyperspeed wireless technology that is 25% faster than the competition all packed o into lightweight body with optical mouse switches check it out below oh wow so after several days of testing and over 20 different airflow configurations that I tested inside the Lancool II Mesh I am genuinely excited about this enclosure and really hope that mainly can deliver on the quantities because this thing will 100% be in demand I don't want to oversell it but check this out guys had $89 so the same price of the original lancool 2 but now it's so much additional airflow available in both black and white the white model is going to be $10 extra and there's also the performance Edition which is what I have here includes two 140 mm load of fans at the front and a single 120 at the back and there's also the a RGB model also an $89 price point so there is no difference so you have to choose between going with the bling which includes three one 2000 RGB fans in the front or going with something more performance and muted looking I think it's a fantastic direction for Lian Li need to take not to separate the RGB versus performance side and keep it at the same price kam is making another appearance what do you guys think now the match here is similar to what we saw with Phanteks P500A for example but the holes here are slightly bigger at 1.5 millimeters versus 1 millimeter on the Phanteks enclosure so that's probably why the airflow performance is better but I am concerned about dust accumulation particularly on the interior the holes aren't large enough to catch like really fine particles so that's something to kind of be concerned about and I totally understand their decision not to include a dust filter behind the metal mesh because that will significantly reduce airflow the metal mesh here is pretty rigid it doesn't flex very nice and one of the reasons why I did so many airflow tests is because the shroud door on the side is now perforated unlike being totally solid on the original Lian Li told me that the perforation on side helps with GPU cooling especially when you add additional fans on the PSU shroud so we'll be testing that later as for the rest of the exterior features everything is identical I love these swivel TG side panels on both sides we do have a little magnets in the front and little pegs that kind of sit into the frame so the glass panel doesn't vibrate or shake upon transport you cannot secure the side panels fully but the magnets are pretty strong so they latch in nicely you can remove the power supply doors there's four screws on each side and they don't completely open fully so that if you do lift the case they kind of maintain their shape on where they would lie on the table for example the IO is up top with dual USB three is power reset switch a combo audio jack and an optional type-c port if you buy the accessory and if this accessory is not populated it kind of looks weird there's that something got stuck in that little cutout since I have the performance model we do have a built in fan controller and I wouldn't think that I would enjoy it that much but we have low medium and high speeds plus a PWM control if you just plug this into your motherboard the fan controller is at the back sitting on its own little removable plate and all the fans here are PWM which is fantastic at this price point and the fan controller can support up to six four and fans now the unique thing about airflow in this enclosure outside of having the metal mesh in the front that is completely unrestrictive you'll see why in a second but I really appreciate their fan bracket at the front that is pretty modular and the hope more companies try to sort of recreate the same design it can support up to a 360 radiator but the cool thing about the bracket is it has a lot of mobility within the frame so for example if you're doing a push and pull setup you can mount the brackets like the inwards to have the fans on the outside of the bracket have the radiator and more fans you can also rotate the bracket which might make installation of fans easier down the line if you're trying to remove something from the actual frame and whole idea here is to give users the range of clearance between the frame and between the power supply cut out and that ranges 55 millimeters all do up to 110 million years and as for the top we have a removable dust filter here pretty standard with our usual configuration of fans that are both slightly inwards and are offset from the motherboard and support up to 240 radiator as we move inside one of the coolest features is the rotatable cable cover after removing two screws you can rotate the bracket and have spacing for an e ATX motherboard without compromising on cable routing and the whole ease of assembly as you can see the power supply shroud is slightly different versus the original and that is because we can install choices these in that spot or remove those bracket and install dual 120mm fans and that is supposed to significantly help with cooling of the GPU and that is why that perforated mesh is so important and my only complaint about this entire design is the bottom hard drive cage I do appreciate that it's it's on Rails so you can move it slightly away from the power supply or away from the front to give you a bit more clearance you can also buy this optional hotspot wall bracket at the back which is great for this price point but the drive cage itself isn't meant to be removable and the reason why you want to remove it is because first of all it interferes without entire cut out at the front and number two the case is pretty compact already so having the power supply all the way in its closest position to the power supply leaves very little room for the power supply cables I did forcefully remove the drive cage from the front just to clear out that whole basement area but nearly made it clear that the intent is for this drive cage to sit and live in the basement as for additional storage we have Drive caddies on the right power supply door plus we have two additional SSD caddies behind the motherboard tray and I really appreciate this case for this $89 price point because of all the little panels that are installed at the back to hide all your cables and make that whole section look really clean which is why the right side panel is also glass the only thing I do not appreciate are the thumb screws because the threading is very short and it's making it really difficult to put them back together and all the screws in the front as well we're extremely tight for me I almost stripped a few screws but Lian Li made sure to double-check their quality control and make sure that doesn't happen for retail units lastly there is a power supply dust filter at the bottom and I think it's time for you to witness the assembly sequence after everything was complete it's a an extremely easy case to work in not just because of the cable bar and how you can move it and the kind of cleanly hides everything and it does not interfere with that USB 3 cable coming from the side while the back of the motherboard is clean primarily because of all the plates that you can cover all the cables with so now it's time to talk about the airflow and this thing is absolutely impressive alright so let's begin a stock configuration that - profile 72 and 72 fantastic temperature's going to medium fan profile surprised that didn't change anything and going to low CPU and GPU both rise slightly in temperatures removing the front panel altogether at - profile does drop our temperatures slightly and adding a single fan on top of the power supply shroud had improved our GPU temperatures but slightly rising CPU temperatures I'm guessing because that he kind of gets carried from the GPU into the CPU area liam lee has confirmed this result this happens on their end - I then shifted the front bracket closer inwards away from the front panel and closer to my hardware components and at - profile it actually increased our GPU temperature by a single degree this could be a margin of error but one interesting thing here was that the noise profile was slightly louder versus when the fan racket was right against of the mesh and speaking of the noise profile keep things at medium or low because otherwise it's quite loud the next thing I wanted to do was swap out the r-tx 20 60 super for something harder like my GTX 1084 the win because I really wanted to test if that power supply perforation on the shroud actually did something so I redid all my testing and you can see again that in the low stock configuration the GPU and CPU temperatures spiked up a little bit just like with my r-tx 20 60 super I then blocked a shroud door and got the pretty surprising result especially when the fan configuration is running on low because I actually get cooler temperatures this way by the high configuration remained at 70 and 70 I then added the shroud fan and on low configuration this is impressive because the CPU temperature rose pretty significantly but we did drop the GPU like but by 5 degrees while having the fan configuration running on high plaster shroud fan dropped our GPU temperature but this is already a pretty loud configuration and the final thing to test was to keep the shroud fan there but blocked the side ventilation to see if that would impact our temperatures it looks like what Lily said about having ventilation on the side does actually help the GPU temperatures because by blocking that ventilation our GPU rose versus when we have the shroud fan in place and the side relation opened so the shroud fan helps with GPU cooling if your GPU is really toasty and hot but it does reintroduce heat into the CPU loop finally when we compare the Lanco to mesh versus all my other tests this is the coolest case in my stack configuration this of course is at maximum speed and the noise profile is quite similar to the really loud p500 a when the fans are running at full blast but lowering the fan controller to medium gives us the same temperature but at a much reduced noise level so if you've been looking for an airflow enclosure that isn't too large you know components look totally fine and proportional inside the interior the Lancoil II Mesh performance Edition is absolutely fantastic it doesn't have much bling like the original but feature wise this is the case to beat in 2020 and we're giving it the Hardware Canucks Dam Good award Lian Li you done good alright guys I'm Dimitri thanks much for watching let me know what you think of the Alenko - mesh will this be your next case let me know in the comments check out the Sutherland content subscribe for more I'll talk to you in the next video",

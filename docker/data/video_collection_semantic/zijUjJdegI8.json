    "transcript": "(shapes springing) (smooth R&B music) - Hey! What's up y'all? I'm MKBHD here. And today, Samsung had their expected summer Unpacked event in July, and they announced two new phones and three new wearable devices. Well, it's more than that if you count, like, the small and the large sizes, but a lot of stuff. I got to go hands-on with all of it, and so here are my first impressions. So I'm gonna start with the two new phones. This was the reveal of the newest foldables, so you got Z Flip 6 and Z Fold 6. And in general, these phones are very much still minor iterations on top of the last year. Shocker. I was actually thinking about that. Like, this kind of feels like a dismissive way of saying it. Like, \"Oh, Samsung settled. \"They're not really changing anything.\" Which is kind of true, but also, on the other hand, these are still phones that are at the forefront of two of some of the most advanced parts of the tech world, which is foldables and AI. So there's that. So, yeah, the Fold 6, the big one, looks just like the Fold 5. You know, square up the sides a bit more, change up the look of the camera housing just a little bit, and give it slightly thinner bezels on the inside and the outside. And that makes the cover screen just a tiny bit more usable. And now both of these screens get up to 2,600 knits now. Give it the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. Give it some new colors. And that's about it. You got yourself a new generation. I mean, there's a couple other even smaller things. Like, you know, a slightly better hinge. There is a new ultra-wide camera. And the square sides, I think, give it a little bit more interior volume, which allows for the 60% larger vapor chamber for better cooling. But aside from that, like, same battery size, same general form factor, same under-screen camera on the inside, just a lot of the same stuff. I think more of the focus for this phone and for the others, of course, is this new AI, this Galaxy AI thing that they're pushing to the forefront. And so kind of similarly to what Apple just did a couple months ago is they're trying to surface all of the AI things that they've been doing and some new stuff to the top so you can see it all in one place so regular people actually use it. And they also kind of brand it Galaxy AI. Sure. So now, in the settings app, right at the top, there's this new Galaxy AI section full of all of the newest features. Some of them genuinely useful, I'll say, others maybe not so much. Like Call assist, okay, clearly, that can be useful. Like there's things like the interpreter, you can speak back and forth to people in different languages. That's cool. Note assist is gonna help people summarize things inside the Notes app. Transcript assist will summarize voice notes. All these things are pretty standard. We've seen them before. If you use Samsung's browser instead of Chrome for some reason, you can hit that stars AI button and get all the summarization you'd want of any webpage that has a bunch of text on it. We've seen that before. Generative fill of some extra information from a photo you've taken is also not new, but now it's new to Samsung's Gallery app. So if you wanna make a photo a wider angle than it actually was when you took it, or maybe just straighten the horizon or something, and you need to fill in some corners, it seems to do a surprisingly good job at that. But then there's also Drawing assist, which can take something you draw or sketch in Notes, even if you're an absolute piss-poor artist like myself, and it generates art in any number of different styles from it in Samsung Notes. It looks almost exactly like what Apple's, like, Image Playgrounds app is doing. The watercolor style, a little more tame, but then there's also this 3D cartoon style. And if you give it some time, honestly, pretty impressive. I don't know if this is good art, but it's just a lot. You know, that's a lot to do with my finger painting. So anyway, the Z Flip 6 is again along a lot of the same lines as the Z Fold 6. So again, Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, squared-up sides, slightly refreshed design. And spec-wise, they've kind of matched a lot of things with the base S24. So it actually has the camera from the base S24: The 50-megapixel main camera and the 12-megapixel ultra-wide. The battery gets bigger, it goes from 3,700 up to 4,000 milliamp hours, which is promising. And that inside screen does also get to 2,600 knits now, as well. And there's a wider variety of, like, widgets for the outside screen. So, ideally, it just gets a little bit more useful than before. And it also gets a vapor chamber for the first time in a Flip and a new base of 12 gigs of RAM. And there's these new colored metal rings around the cameras, so you can kind of visually tell, \"Oh, this is the new one.\" Like, I'm convinced that's the only reason they did these rings. But yeah, we'll have to see if these phones and their folding screens age better than the previous generation. Obviously, a slightly better hinge can help, but as far as I can tell, they just look like the same level of crease, the same feel of a hinge, just overall very similar hardware package to the last year. The cherry on top, though, is these phones are both 100 bucks more than last year. So the Z Flip 6 is gonna be 1,099 instead of $1,000, and then the Fold is gonna be 1,899 instead of 1,799. So it's the direction they're trending. But then there's also the wearable stuff that they announced, and I think people will be just as interested in, maybe even more interested in the wearables than the phone refresh stuff. So there's two new watches, two new earbuds, and the ring. So the Galaxy Watch 7 gets a nice little refresh. Nothing too dramatic, it still looks super familiar, and it stays starting at 299 for the 40-millimeter. But then they've dropped in a big one. There is a Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra in the lineup now. We saw the rumors, I talked about on the \"Waveform\" podcast. This is something that we've been kind of expecting for a bit. And what they've finally come up with is titanium body, sapphire crystal display, same size 1.5-inch circular display as the 44-millimeter, but a much beefier body around it to fit in a 590-milliamp hour battery. It's water resistant to 100 meters. They gave it a new watch face. Dual frequency GPS, which is also coming to the Watch 7. And as you can see, they gave it this big orange button called the Action Button. Oh, sorry, I mean the Quick Button. It's called the Quick Button. (laughs) Which is a custom mappable, yes, activity button that can start any number of different activities or workouts or whatever you want it to do. I mean, look, it's clear that this is targeted at the Apple Watch Ultra. I don't think they're trying to hide that at all. It's literally the same name. But this one is also $650 instead of Apple's $800. So my question is basically just how do they stack up head-to-head? Battery-wise, it may actually be better. They're saying it can do 100 hours in power-saving mode. But also, you know, feature-wise, accuracy-wise, we'll see. Samsung is also doing this new thing where they basically compile all of your health metrics from everything they measure into one score, an Energy Score, with AI. And I wanna give that a shot, as well. But yeah, this is basically just an obvious entry to give you an option at that higher price point, like Apple's done with their Ultra watch, so now it's gonna be out there. Now, they also announced the new Galaxy Buds3 and Buds2 Pro, and they have obvious equivalents in other ecosystems, as well. But there's some new cases and new designs here. Everyone's saying, actually, aesthetically, they look like the first-generation AirPods, which they're not wrong, especially at the top. But then these long stems on the Buds Pro actually have these blade lights to indicate different modes or statuses, which is pretty interesting. And then, of course, they beef up the Pros over the regular buds, with things like Ambient mode and soft tips and this new adaptive noise cancellation that goes up or down based on the surroundings, like sirens. So the Buds3 are 179, and the Buds Pro are 249. But last but not least, they finally gave us details on the ring, that thing that they teased, I don't know how many months ago it was when we first saw it. And the idea is pretty simple. It's a ring, it's a 24/7 fitness tracker, something that you can wear not just while you're awake, but when you sleep and when you shower and going swimming and all that stuff. Something you just always have on you. Now, I've actually never tested a smart ring before, believe it or not. I play a lot of sports with my hands. I've never worn a ring for a long time. But from what I understand, the Oura Ring is basically the standard that everyone is kind of familiar with, so I'm assuming Samsung's gonna at least try to match what the Oura Ring does. So we finally get to see this Samsung ring, and it looks basically exactly like any other smart ring. Pretty minimal on the outside, actually a slightly concave design to avoid scratching, which I think is pretty clever. And then, it comes in three different finishes on a titanium frame. There's matte black or silver or gold. I'll give you one guess of what my favorite is. It's seven millimeters wide and 2.6 millimeters thick. The sensors are all on the inside as expected, so heart rate, skin temperature, accelerometer, et cetera. And also, it's water resistant to 100 meters, as well. So this thing is claiming a roughly seven-day battery life, depending on your size. And once it's dead, you can pop it on this clever little charging case that, when you do, it kind of lights up a ring around the ring to show you your charging status, which is kind of cool. And it should give you about 1 1/2 more times the total life of the ring until you charge it all up again. And then the price will be 399, which is 100 bucks more than the base Oura Ring price. But the difference here is no subscription cost. So the Oura Ring does have a subscription, it's, like, six bucks a month, and that eventually adds up. But this will just be 399 for the watch. It gets all the features, all the Samsung Health stuff, but you also must use a Samsung Galaxy phone and the Samsung Health app. So yeah, I'm happy to see some competition that isn't a subscription. And that's kind of it. That is what Samsung announced today. It's two new phones, it's two new earbuds, it's two new watches, and the ring, and that's all hitting shelves relatively soon. All pretty premiumly priced, as well. Wow, that was an alliteration. That was total accident. But yeah, all this stuff's coming out soon. Now, before you go, what if I told you this phone is worth $1 million? And it's not actually, but let me explain what channel sponsor dbrand has going on here. So this is their latest drop called Case Hardened. So, if you've ever played \"Counter-Strike,\" apparently, you'll already know about the in-game economy for Case Hardened skins. In fact, just last month, this AK-47 apparently sold for over $1 million, like, actual dollars. Apparently, this Blue Gem skin is about a one in 21 million, like, ultra rare. Now, real \"Counter-Strike\" fans are probably already typing comments about how dbrand Case Hardened isn't random, and there aren't any actual Blue Gems. But here's the thing: Just like in the game, dbrand made thousands of Case Hardened patterns. And yes, some of them are random Blue Gems. It won't be quite one in 21 million, but they look awesome. Both designs have a sort of a metallic sheen. The way the light plays off them kind of makes it fun to stare at the back of your phone instead of the front. Maybe that's healthy? But I'll leave a link down below in the description in case you wanna check it out and spice up your device. 'Cause, yeah, Samsung does not exactly go hard with the colors usually. Yeah, either way, that's been it. Let me know what you think of these new devices and these new wearables and which ones you wanna see reviews of first. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys on the next one. Peace. (smooth R&B music)",

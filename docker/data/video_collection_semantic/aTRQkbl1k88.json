    "description": "(   ) --- Today's Mystery Video -   Kapture Recording Wristband -   This device allows you to capture the last 60 seconds of audio at any moment. Double tap to save the last clip and relive what just finished happening. Sounds weird... Is weird.  From the manufacturer -   We hear amazing stuff everyday, but what do we do with what we hear? When you see something cool, you take out your camera and snap a photo to savor the moment. But when you hear something, you often don't get the chance to go back and get it, to relive it or to share it with anyone. Kapture gives you the opportunity to always save the last 1-minute of what you've just heard. Like a little time machine. We've built a wearable device (IOT) that you tap as soon as you recognize something worth saving. The simple tap sends the previous minute of audio to your smartphone using Bluetooth, where you use our app to edit and share. You don't have to know or anticipate when something awesome will happen. Just tap after-the-fact to save these unexpected moments, whether you're by yourself, with your family, or out with friends. Make your moments heard.

    "transcript": "so today we're looking at something called the Kapture with a 'k' because it's 2.0 and I think it might have been on Kickstarter what is this thing It plays back what you've just heard you can tap it to save and share what you've just heard it's always recording but only when you tap on it after the fact and let it know that you want the last 60 seconds I if you're in a kind of environment where you got a guy like Jack waltzing around this is exactly what you need because the man says some crazy stuff when he decides to speak look at that oh ok charge it up yeah pairs via bluetooth good when it's running it's blinking then you tap and it will save the last 60 seconds maybe you're at a bar some dude wants to fight you're like no officer I've got the recording you can see how it went down yes again looks like a watch actually looks more like one of those fitbit trackers you get the charger is that magnetic yeah does this have power needs to be paired with your phone via bluetooth before you get started charging up I downloaded the app by the same name Kapture with a 'k' saves the previous 60 seconds of audio every time you tap this screen we just did something *recording* buffering does that mean it's just running right now *end recording* that is weird dude yeah its flashing green every five seconds so it's in listening mode so everything that's happening it's recording now I should be able to tap it twice from this mode at any given point and get the last 60 seconds of discussion oh wow got the buzz it's doing two different clips maybe that's the issue it can store 25 clips before transferring via bluetooth ok they're there *recording* oh it's in listening mode right now okay I think it was just getting an update now I should be able to tap it twice from this mode at any given point and get the last 60 seconds of discussion so let me do that *end recording* that was it oh no I di... that was it I didn't do it as.. I didn't do it on the right spot you gotta tap it right in the middle is tapping you the band and see what they're saying deliberate it's not like tata it's like ugh ugh I th... I'm getting it figuring the tap out from here it works every time hey how's it going nice to meet you blah blah blah *recording* hey how's it going nice to meet you blah blah blah so this thing's been charging for a little bit longer the green is good green is good it means it's listening ok I got it that was deliberate now I should get a notification on my phone that it's transferring so it seems like even when it fails a transfer the clip is still saved here so even if it runs out of battery or this guy saves the last 25 clips the *recording* when you pull it off the charger it goes instantly to listening mode *end recording* it's just so weird to hear what you just said it's just weird *recording* the green is good green is good it means it's listening so in here I can trim them add a description add a filter change the volume reverb et cetera I can attach an image or a picture to these memories deliberate push okay I'm getting the hang of it now they want me to tap it again to retry so I mean it's kind of a little bit hit and miss I guess the good part here is that it is always stored it's only one file maybe I did lose those two that time it's a little janky knock knock who's there double tap so far it's like 50 50 maybe *recording* knock knock who's there double tap *end recording* I don't know what to tell you guys it appears to be working let's put it that way it's just like when it comes to transferring the clips to the phone things get a little strange and I guess you just put it on but you don't think about it and then that moment strikes and you're like and then you just got all of that whatever that was *recording* and then that moment strikes and you're like *end recording*",

    "description": "Its time to race the GoPro Karma against the DJI Mavic AND the super fast Phantom 4.  This race will take into account the top speed of each drone AND the turning ability. On paper the GoPro Karma can go 35 miles per hour. The DJI Mavic can hit a top speed of 40 miles an hour in 'Sport mode' and the Phantom 4 is the fastest drone of the trio that tops out at an impressive 45 miles an hour. But... thats only on paper. Watch the video to see who really wins.   Get your DJI Mavic HERE:  Get the Phantom 4 HERE:   Special thanks to Jared:  and Joel:  And my brother Spencer for being the pilots today.   The GoPro Karma was recalled a few days after we filmed this race. Every single Karma that was sold is being recalled.  If it was just a software issue... GoPro could have just updated all their drones. BUT since they are physically recalling every drone they sold (About 2500 drones) it makes me think that the issue is a physical one; in the hardware of the drone.    Its super unfortunate that the GoPro Karma is being recalled. Hopefully GoPro is able to fix the issue quickly and get the drone back on the shelves fast.   *Follow me for updates!* Instagram:  Facebook:  Twitter:  Snapchat:  GooglePlus:   JerryRigEverything assumes no liability for property damage or injury incurred as a result of any of the information contained in this video.

    "transcript": "So right now we have three of the most popular consumer drones. We have the GoPro Karma, the DJI Mavic and the Phantom 4. Were going to see which one is fastest. Jared, what do you think? [Jared] Um, I honestly think this one will be the slowest. I think it will be a tossup between the Mavic Pro and the Phantom 4. Zack] Alright. So were going to race these three drones going across the sidewalk and then coming back, and whoever reaches back here first wins. And then this drone is going to be getting an aerial shot of the whole race. Lets get started. [Incessant buzzing] Try not to hit each other on the way back when you come back. [Jared] Okay. [Zack] Okay, on the count of three: one, two, three. [Jared] Oh my gosh, Im winning this! [Zack] Alright, I think I crossed. [Jared] Oh I definitely crossed. [Joel] The cameras not even following. I have no idea where Im at. [Zack] Im coming back. We are so going to wreck each other. [Jared] Oohh! Ha ha! Oh no its closethat was close! [Zack] Who was in front? Who was in front? [Jared] I dont know! [Joel] Im coming guys. Keep coming. [Zack] On the count of three: one, two, three. [Jared] Ooohh, full blast Karma! [Zack] Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright. Im past. [Joel] I cant see where Im at. [Jared] Well, thats a perfect turn if Ive ever seen one myself! [Zack] Where am I going? [Jared] Oh my gosh Im going to win! [Zack] No no, Im up Im up! [Jared] I think you beat me. I think you beat me. That was close! [Zack] Im impressed. The GoPro is doing really good. [Jared] In normal mode its keeping up really really well. [Zack] Do we even want to try sport mode, cuz its going to be fast. [Jared] Its going to be pathetic, but [Zack] So now were switching into sport mode which means the drones are way faster. And theres no safety features as far as like obstacle avoidance so we have to make sure not to hit each other or the building behind us. One, two, three. [Joel] Oh my gosh. Mines not going any further. It wont even go. [Jared] Ha ha ha! Oh dude I smoked you! I smoked you! [Zack] Youre hauling dude! You beat me by at least 30 feet on that one. [Jared] I took a really really good turn on that though. That was a sweet turn. [Joel] Im not going to lie. Im not controlling this at all. Im not controlling this at all. I dont know whats going on. Hm. [Zack] One, two, three. [Joel] No control. Ha! [Jared] Ohhh no what am I about to do? Oh no Im out of control! Wheres my control?! [Joel] Holy cow. [Zack] I think I had you on that one. [Jared] I think you did too. I was way all over the place. I was everywhere. [Zack] It is so fast! One, two, three! [Jared] Joel, go uppull left ha ha! [Zack] Oh no. I found the trees guys. [Joel] Oh I have no idea where Im at. Oh. [Jared] Oh my gosh dude, Im going to beat you guys. Dude youre way over there! [Zack] Where? Agggg! [Jared] I am going to win! [Zack] I thought that group of people was us. Whoa, come back! [Jared] Im going to win! Yeah!!! Dude, that is the tortoise in the air right there. That is just what happened. [Zack] I dont even know where my drone is. [Jared] The way to beat the Phantom 4 and the Mavic Pro is to have inexperienced racers! [Joel] Yeah, both of them get lost. [Zack] Whoa! Alright lets try that again. That was the only time the GoPro won right? [Jared] Yeah! [Zack] Alright so we just finished racing and it turns out it doesnt really matter as much if the drone is fast its more the pilot. [Jared] That is a huge factor in this. [Joel] Like 99 percent of the problem. [Zack] Cuz each of the drones won at least once right? [Jared] Yes, uh huh. [Zack] And I think the only time the GoPro won was when both me and Joel got lost somewhere in the field. [Jared] Right. Even without sport mode though, the GoPro did hold up pretty well. [Zack] Yeah. It did. So during this whole process, both of the DJI drones were fine, but we actually had some problems with the Karma drone. What do you think was going on? [Jared] Well the Karma just disconnected one time and then landed all by itself, probably in the second or third race and we had to restart, reconnect it and get it up off the ground again and it wouldnt take off for a little bit. So I think some software updates are definitely needed to make sure that this is as reliable as the DJI. [Joel] But thats kind of a failsafe to me cuz now at any point if you do lose connection, its going to take care of itself and land. [Jared] That is right. [Joel] Hopefully its got a good place to land. I like that. [Zack] And Spencer this was your first time ever flying a drone and as our camera guy, what do you think about the Phantom? [Spencer] Its really easy to pilot and pretty hard to crash. [Zack] So Jared and I did a camera comparison between the DJI Mavic and the GoPro Karma and thats on my channel. And we also unboxed both of these drones on Jareds channel. So Ill link both of those down in the video description below and at the end of this video so you can check out those videos. If you had to pick one drone to buy for yourself, which one would it be? Would it be the DJI Mavic or the Go Pro Karma or the Phantom 4? Let me know down in the comments. Thanks a ton for watching, Ill see you around. [Jared] Bye!",

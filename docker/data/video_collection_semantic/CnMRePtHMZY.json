    "transcript": "This is a Peltier element. It may looklike a rather unassuming hunk of material, but sandwiched between these two plates area whole bunch of semiconductor junctions that have been carefully arranged to do something remarkable: when I apply a DC voltage across these two wires, the plate becomes cold. This iscalled thermoelectric cooling, and its happening thanks to the Peltiereffect. With advances in manufacturing, we are now able to produce these devices quicklyand cheaply. These ones here cost less than $3 each. Theres just one little issue with thistechnology: its not very good. Like, at all. OK, were gonna need some context. Im making this video for a couple of reasons: First, you may know about my one true love, therefrigeration cycle. I adore a good heat pump and could talk your ear off about themfor hours on end, but vapor-compression based refrigeration systems are bulky and mechanicallycomplex affairs. They also have some environmental issues stemming from the refrigerantsthey use. Because of those downsides, with a regularity you could practically set awatch to well-meaning people discover Peltier elements and question why we dont use theseinstead. A device with no moving parts and which makes cooling happen simply by puttingvoltage across it does feel like the future! Thats gotta be better than all the faff we go through to build a fridge, right? Well, better is a slippery word. For onething, the Peltier these are named for is Jean Charles Athanase Peltier, and he discovered thisphenomenon back in 1834. Weve been taking cracks at this for a long time, yet it still hasntchanged the world. It is true that this form of cooling offers some unique advantages and in veryspecific applications with equally specific design constraints, using a Peltier element can make somesense. However, the situations in which these are truly appropriate to use are very, very rare. Youwill absolutely understand why that is by the end, but for now (and this leads into the secondreason Im making this video) you should know that the majority of products on sale today which use these things are being made purely to capitalize on the fact that we just cant stop ourselves from buying cheap crap. Speaking of cheap crap, youve probably seenthese little personal refrigerators before. The idea is you can keep a few cans of your favorite beverage cool on your desk! Youll be the talk of the office, for sure! All of these things usePeltier elements to cool their insides for a very simple reason: cost. These have to be cheapenough for people to pick them up impulsively. And they are - this was priced just over $30. You cant build a proper fridge that cheaply, but you can build a little plastic box with acheap power supply and $2 Peltier module in it. And people will buy it. Look, Im a people, and Ibought it! But is it any good? Spoiler alert: No! Lets turn it on and put it through itspaces! It has a power switch helpfully labeled Off and Cold. That's a sign ofquality, that is. Here goes nothing! [a fan spins up] Ooh, its even got an interior light! How thoughtful. But, uh, thats a lot of noise for something with no moving parts. What gives? Well, the Peltierelement itself doesnt have any moving parts but when I showed you it in the beginning, I onlyshowed one side of it. That side was getting cold, yes, and in this... alleged fridge the cold side ofthe element is bonded to the rear wall which we can see getting cold in the thermal camera. Butas the peltier element generates cooling on the one side, the other side of the elementgets hot. Very hot. Problematically hot. Why? Well, two reasons. Peltier modules producecooling by absorbing heat on the cold side and moving it through the element to the hot side. Thats how all cooling works - energy doesnt just disappear, so to lower the amount of heatenergy in one location, you have to absorb it from that location and move it somewhere else. Which is exactly what these do. They absorb heat on this side (which to us feels like coldness) andreject it on the hot side. But since the heat is only moving across a thin little barrier withvery little mass, it builds up really quickly. But thats not all! The element itself createsheat as it runs. These here are rated 5 amps at 12 volts, so when running at full capacity theyre dissipating 60watts of heat in a really small space, and thats on top of the heat its pulling from the coldside. So, to keep it from destroying itself, you need a finned heat sink bonded tothe hot side to spread that heat out, and youll also need a fan to force air across the heat sink to spread the heat even more quicklier. And as we can see here, the itty bitty fridge has a generously sized heat sink hanging off the back with a fan blowing right at it. A fan andheat sink pair isnt complicated or expensive, but it means this is noisier than you mightexpect and, ya know, adds a moving part. But noise is forgivable, the real question ishow well does it work? And the answer to that question is: not! And by every conceivablemetric you can imagine. For a start, you may have noticed this has no temperaturesettings. Its just cold or off. Thats because it only promises to lower the internal temperature by up to 30 degrees below ambient temperature. Thats it. I appreciate its honesty, but if youknow anything about food safety, youre gonna be getting the willies right now. Because in anoffice environment during the summertime where, say, the room temperature might be 75 degreesFahrenheit, this thing will - at best - get the interior down to 45 degrees Fahrenheit which byUS standards is not food safe. So strike one. But ok, lets say you just want to cool some beverages and you dont care about food. Well, to see how well it manages that I loaded it upfully with 6 room temperature beverage cans then shoved one of my temperature data loggers in thevoid space between them. After running for two hours, it hadnt even gotten below 60 degreesinside here. After 12 hours it had only managed to drop to 48 degrees Fahrenheit, and after 24hours the temperature had plateaued at about 46 degrees. Not very impressive. Somehow it got abit of a second wind right near the 24 hour mark, which I believe happened just because the room it was in had cooled off a little, and we ended up bottoming out at 45.5 degrees. Which, in fairness, wasabout 30 degrees below the room temperature. So it did what it said it would, but it sure tookages to get there. However, I was measuring the air temperature in the center of the fridge andsince the cans are all touching the sides, I found that the actual temperature of the liquid in those cans was a slightly warmer 50 degrees. Chilled, I suppose, but I wouldnt want abeer that warm. So strike two. But okay, so its not technically a refrigerator and it takes forever to cool down and it doesnt keep things that cold and its louder than the boximplies but that doesnt mean its not useful! And to that Id say, youre not technically wrong! Some people use these things to keep certain cosmetic items in a cool, dry place, and fromwhat I can tell theyre happy to have these! And if 50 degrees is cold enough for you, and youre diligent about rotating cans in and out, you might actually enjoy this as a beverage cooler. Buthere comes strike three, and its a doozy (and also why Peltier devices are generally terrible). If youre at all concerned with how much energy this thing will use to do its job not very well, you should know that this thing consumes about 55 watts of power all the time. Thats not a tonof power, no, but guess what uses less power than that? Well, lots of things but most relevantto this discussion - an actual refrigerator. This here is what I call the standard cubefridge, the most basic mini-fridge you can buy. Theyre generally around $100 andwhile they are incredibly basic they are also actual refrigerators. We have a lilbaby compressor back here pumping refrigerant through an honest-to-goodness refrigerationcircuit. Now, it did cost significantly more money to purchase than the blue... thing, but itcan also hold a lot more stuff. Including the blue fridge. By the internationally recognizedmetric of how many cans of La Croix can you shove in there per dollar the real fridgewins by a lot. Itll hold 33 cans easily, and 36 if youre a little bit creative, which works out to $2.77 per can. And the blue fridge, despite only costing $30, only holds six cans so thats $5 per can. But thats not the real issue. Remember,the blue fridge uses 55 watts all the time. Guess how much power this thing uses? Oncethe refrigeration circuit has stabilized, it pulls between 45 and 50 watts from the wall. Ive consulted with some math scholars who have confirmed for me that that figure is less thanthe 55 watts the stupid blue fridge pulls. But thats not all! This, because its an actualrefrigerator, has a thermostat to maintain food safe temperatures inside! And that means it doesntrun all the time. I monitored its energy use when loaded up with 15 already-chilled beveragecans, and to keep them cool over three hours, it consumed just 65 watt-hours representing anaverage draw of 21.7 watts. And, by the way, the room it was in during thattest was a pretty warm 78 degrees. Now, electricity isnt free. So lets doa little cost comparison. The blue fridge, with its constant 55 watt draw, will consume39.6 kilowatt-hours per month. Going by the average cost of electricity in the US of $0.14per kilowatt-hour, it will cost about $5.50 per month to use continuously. So about$66 a year. The much larger mini fridge, on the other hand, drawing 22 watts continuouslywill consume 15.8 kilowatt-hours in a month, which costs $2.21 per month, or $27 bucks a year. Thats $39 less than the blue fridge per year, so it doesnt even take two years ofoperation for the extra $70 you spend on the real fridge to pay for itself. Seemslike this blue fridge might be kind of bad! Now I could stop here, but Im not gonna becausethis thing's awful efficiency just gets funnier the more context you have. You remember this goofy thing. Its moved into my office and has an actual temperature controller now which fixes its majorflaw. Its still by no means a good refrigerator - stick a twelve pack of room temperature cansin there and it runs nonstop for almost four hours. Its really not built for making warmthings cold. But as far as its ability to maintain food safe temperatures, it does the jobjust fine. And how much energy does it use? Well, after adding 6 room temperature beverage cans, I measuredits energy use over 24 hours and it needed only 970 watt-hours, meaning on average it only pulled40.4 watts. Which, believe it or not, is less than 55. And thats despite the rather pronounced size difference between these two machines. I mean just look at them! Its frankly ridiculousthat such a tiny little fridge is using more energy than the comparatively gigantic onenext to it. In an earlier 24 hour test when the weather was a little cooler, the red fridgeconsumed just 890 watt-hours in 24 hours while the stupid little blue one needed 1,290 watt hoursover the same period. Because its always pulling 55 watts whenever its switched on. Thats 45% moreenergy spent only kind of cooling six cans. And ya know how many cans this sucker willhold? If you fill the crisper drawer, all the door shelves, and double stack on the top shelf,itll hold 135 cans. Itll take it forever to make them all cold but once they get there the fridgewill use roughly the same 900 watt-hours per day keeping them all ice cold. Are you starting tounderstand why I keep calling this stupid junk? And lets not forget the red fridge has a freezercompartment for ice cream and pizza and stuff! Now, as Ive covered before, mini-fridgesare actually some of the least energy-efficient refrigerators out there thanks to theirminimal insulation. And by the way, I need to clear something up for the Europeans who keep badgering me about this: I never said the red fridge was a mini-fridge! A bunch of you heard me say that somewhere but I would never consider a fridge which goes up tomy chest to be a mini-fridge. I called it little, and I called it a bit on the small side but I also said, and I quote, its much bigger than a typical mini-fridge and served me well as adecently competent refrigerator. At the very end of that video I did lump it into the category of mini-fridges because of its thin walls, but thats as close as I ever got to calling ita mini-fridge. Methinks your confirmation bias kicked in a little early and a little strong. Maybe those 230 volts are gettin to your head. But speaking of Americans and their giantAmerican fridges, [banjo music starts] at home Ive got a GIANT AMERICAN FRIDGE! [said in a thick Southern accent] My 360 pound behemoth (thats163 kilograms for you commies) features automatic defrost for maintenance-free operation, is plumbed to a water line for its built-in ice maker because we want ice in our drinks,goshdarnit, and it has 16.35 All-American Cubic Feet of Fridge Capacity and a 5.59 cubic footfreezer compartment. Thats 461 liters in the fridge and 158 litres in the freezer. And guesswhich of those two fridges uses more energy? THIS STUPID THING! Yes, according to government testing (I didntdo my own, sorry about that) my bottom-freezer, French door fridge (which are twodings against its energy efficiency), despite being able to hold over 50 times as much stuff before we even count the frozen food, and which features heated defrost uses slightly less energy over a year than it takes to run this toy. It needs 1,270 watt-hours per day toattain actual refrigeration compared to the 1,290 this stupid thing used to keep six cansof la croix only kind of chilled. I ask again, are you starting to understand why Ithink these things are stupid junk? Side note, I used the Canadian energy statsbecause as I found out the last go-round, the American EnergyGuide label is very very pessimistic thanks to the way the tests are run. It includes a lot more food browsing in hot weather than I think is typical, and the energy guide label for the red fridge was about 20% higher than my own stress testing. But even if we go with the 633 kWh annual figure, thenmy actual fridge uses only 35 percent more energy for approximately 7,000 percent more refrigeratedspace with a freezer on top of that. Or, below it, actually. So, why is this blue lump ofsadness so much less efficient than any of the refrigerators weve discussed? Because all the rest have heat pumps! Now, very out of character for me, Im going to keep my explanation of the refrigeration cycle pretty brief. Kind ofbrief. Brief-ish. But heres why its such a big deal: a vapor-compression heat pump like the one we find in even this very cheap and basic mini-fridge can move more heat energy out of the fridge's interior than it takes to run the heat pump. That may sound impossible, but the compressor isthe only thing in here doing any work, and all its doing is using an electric motor to spin some pumpy parts inside this enclosure which pressurizes a gas. In the case of this fridge, thats literally the only thing its doing. All the rest of its parts are just pipes and tubes which are exposed to the air inside and out. The gas its compressing is called a refrigerant. Refrigerants are a category of gasses that weve discovered (or sometimes engineered) thathave really useful relationships between their pressure and their boiling point. This fridge,like most on the market today, uses isobutane which at atmospheric pressure is a gas. But ifyou pressurize isobutane to about 80 PSI, its boiling point shoots up to 110 degrees Fahrenheit. Thats much hotter than typical room temperatures, so if you feed that high pressure gas through some tubes that are exposed to ambient air, the air will cool it down to the pointthat it cant be a gas anymore and itwill spontaneously condense into a liquid. Thatcondensing action releases a ton of heat energy because of a thing called the latent heat of vaporization which to save time I am not getting into right now, but you can see this heat being releasedin the thermal camera. You can even make out the tubes the refrigerant is traveling through justbelow the surface of the fridges outer skin. Thanks to the pumping action of the compressor, the refrigerant is actively pushed through those tubes. At the entrance its purely hot gas (andits hot because the compressor just compressed it), but as it makes its way through it sheds heatenergy and begins to liquify. By the time it makes it to the end of the tube, a slug of liquidrefrigerant will have bunched up. Then, that liquid refrigerant gets sent through a restriction which limits the volume of fluid flow. Because of the restriction and the pumping action of the compressor, a pressure imbalance is maintained on either side. And once the liquid makes it throughit finds itself inside the evaporator where the pressure is very low, in fact so low that theboiling point of isobutane plummets to something like -20 degrees Fahrenheit. Even the air insidea freezer is warmer than that, which means theres energy available to boil the refrigerant. That causes it to absorb latent heat energy which means it gets very, very cold. Once therefrigerant has completely boiled away and becomes a gas once more, it finds itself back at thecompressor and the whole thing starts over again. The gas its compressing is called a refrigerant. Refrigerants are a category of gasses that weve discovered (or sometimes engineered) that okay thats enough of that. Key to understanding this process isthat the refrigerant, through boiling away, absorbs a lot of heat energy. That heat energy is thenstored in the refrigerant. But, when we compress it and it condenses back into a liquid, it releases the energy it had just absorbed. Since were in control of where that happens, we can move heat energy fromone place to another. In the case of a fridge, were pumping the heat out of the fridges interiorwhich cools it down and then releasing that heat to the outside air. And the only thing were doingto make that happen is compress a gas and pushing it through some pipes. The refrigerant does theheat transfer stuff all on its own. That is how a vapor-compression heat pump is able to move more energy than the machine itself consumes. The heat moving capacity compared to its powerdraw is a metric known as the coefficient of performance. Now, not many people calculate the COPof a fridge, but if I assume it has a COP of 3 then we get a threefold increase in coolingpower compared to input power. In other words, the 45 watts of power this fridge pulls fromthe wall when its running generates 135 watts of cooling power in the evaporator. That is whywe bother with a compressor and all this piping and junk, its just really, really efficient. And thats also why heat pumps for heating our homes are becoming such a big deal: just astheres heat to be pulled out of a freezer, theres heat to be grabbed from the air outside. And so long as the COP of an operating heat pump is over 1, we're getting some free heat compared to running an electric heatingelement. But anyway, this video isn't about that. Peltier elements, because they move heat from oneside to the other, are technically heat pumps. And that means we can measure their coefficientof performance. But thats tricky to do because unlike a vapor-compression heat pump, theirefficiency will vary wildly depending on the temperature difference its fighting as wellas how much current youre shoving through it. Remember, this is really thin. And the materialsused to construct this conduct heat even when its not running at all, so the higher the temperaturedifference between the hot and cold sides, the more heat energy leaks through the element itself and the less efficient it becomes. And the effect there is dramatic. On top of that, the more currentyou try to push through this, the more heat it generates inside itself which also makes thingsworse. In theory, if everything is perfect and you can run these at very low current, you can get aCOP between 1 and 2. But that will hardly generate any cooling at all, so in practice, the COP ofa device using a Peltier element for cooling is somewhere between zero and very bad. And thatswhy this stupid little blue fridge is using so much more energy than this actual fridge. Or thatactual fridge. Or THAT actual fridge. Now, in fairness, there is more going on here. Its reliance on the Peltier effect is of course the major factor in this fridges terrible efficiency, but its also got a lot to do with its design. Any actual fridge is subject to regulations which mean it has to have enough insulation in its walls to pass performance tests. The bluetoy is a toy, and honestly I could barely even detect any insulation at all! The walls all feelhollow. So I drilled some exploratory holes and determined that it does have what appearsto be Styrofoam in the side walls but the door is in fact hollow. Thats great. If thishad more insulation it could probably get its insides cooler using less energy, but itwould then also need some sort of temperature control. I think its actually relying on heat intrusion through the door to keep things from freezing. But any time youre using a Peltier element, even the best designs with lots of thermal insulation are going to run into the fundamental problem of aterrible coefficient of performance. These are just not very good at what theyre supposed to do and will alwayslose a fight with a grown-up heat pump. And, not for nothing, while people fixate onthe harm refrigerants cause (because they have been truly awful to the environment and many in use todaystill are in one way or another) isobutane is not really a problem at all. Its flammablewhich presents some practical challenges, especially when the systems require service, but it has a global warming potential of only 3.3 and its other environmental effectsare negligible. Plus, theres hardly any of it in a fridge. Even my big one at home hasa refrigerant charge of just 55 grams. So when it comes to domestic refrigerators, you honestly dont need to be worried about that anymore. You may remember, though, that I did say Peltierelements have some very specific advantagesin very specific applications. Ive alreadycovered the main one - if you need some cooling as cheaply as possible, they arean option. You just have to be aware of how energy-intensive they are and decidewhether that trade-off is worth it. And sometimes it might be! If, for example,youre only using something occasionally, the poor efficiency of these things might not matter thatmuch. One example would be a portable cooler you can bring with you in the car. If its onlyever going to be used on occasional car rides, and its got the energy source of a car tosupply it, its energy efficiency isnt that critical. And portability is another area where Peltierelements can shine. The elements themselves weigh almost nothing, and even finished productsare quite light. This little thing doesnt even weigh 4 pounds (its 1.68 kilograms to be precise in metric fashion). Meanwhile the mini-fridge, despite having the most adorable little compressorIve ever seen, weighs a much heftier 33 pounds (15 kilograms). In fairness the bulk of its weightisnt from the refrigeration circuit, just the metal parts that make up its body and frame andthe door, but its still a pretty huge difference. And when it comes to portability, vapor-compression based systems have an Achille's heel: they are orientation-sensitive. The compressor thats inside this little black ball is made of metal parts which rubagainst each other and thus need lubrication, and to provide that lubrication (and also cooling for the windings of the electric motor) the systemhas oil in it. The compressor housing formsan oil sump, and we rely on gravity to keep that oil pooled in the bottom of the sump so that thecompressor has the lubrication and cooling that it requires. And Earths gravity, famously, onlyever pulls things towards the center of the Earth, so you have to have this upright for itto work without destroying itself. And, if you move anything with a refrigerationcompressor in it and you arent 100% sureit stayed upright as you moved it, you need tolet these sit upright for at least a few hours before you switch them on so any oil thatmight have gone somewhere it shouldnt candrain back to the sump (many manufacturerswill tell you to wait a full 24 hours before switching them on after they've been moved). Peltier elements, because they don't have anymechanical parts, dont care about that! You can operate this fridge however you like, thoughof course you need to make sure the cooling vents arent blocked, and you'll never have to waitto switch it on after you move it. Its always ready. And Peltier elements also have one last trick up theirsleeves: when you reverse the polarity, they move heat in the opposite direction! Thatmeans you can offer a device which both heats and cools quite trivially. In fact, heated and cooledcupholders in cars is one application for this in real life. You can bond a Peltier element to a thermally conductive ring surrounding a cup holder (and use some sort of heat spreader for the other side of theelement) and you can keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold just by flipping a switch. But, in all honesty, thats mostly a gimmick. I saw it at the auto show when I was maybe 12 and it hasnt taken the world by storm yet. But back to the present. When the designrequirements of very cheap to build, easily portable, and only occasional use all collide, using Peltierelements for cooling makes some sense. But if this is going into something thats going to be in anythingclose to continuous use and energy efficiency matters either for cost or scarcity reasons, it just doesnt make any sense at all. There is in fact a very good reason refrigeration is still happening the way it always has. And if youre looking at a product like this andthinking that might be useful, I would highly suggest you think long and hard about whether oneof these cube fridges might fit your needs. No, theyre not going to fit on your desk (at least not easily) but theylldo a lot more for you using a lot less energy. And these, too, can be had in all sorts of goofy colors if you look in the right places. That said I would be remiss if I didnt mention the big downside to some of these, including this model: ice builds up on the evaporator over time and so this needs occasional defrosting. Depending on what youre using it for that might be veryrare but its something to keep in mind. However, there are also plenty of these out therewhich have rear-mounted, vertical evaporators and skip the freezer compartment entirely, and those dont need defrosting. I would honestly seek one of those out if youre looking fora mini-fridge like this. Honestly the freezer compartment in here is pretty useless and just eats up space. The only reason I grabbed this one was because it was on sale at Menards. Only$80 and you know I mailed in that 11% rebate! And speaking of cheap things from Menards, I should say this particular model has a few annoyances. Its compressor is oddly buzzy,which is disappointing. The red fridge is actually quieter than the thermoelectric fridge, but thisbaby fridge is louder. Theres a good chance I just drew the short straw there and most of thesehave quieter compressors, and besides I dont think it would really be very annoying under a desk. Butsomething to mention. What actually worries me about this model is the fact that the thermostat runs very, very short cycles. Like, once its down to temp it runs for 2 or 3 minutes and then stopsfor 3 or 4. Thats usually not the healthiest thing for a refrigeration compressor. But in thiscase, because of the design here, I actually think thats on purpose. Since the interior is so tiny, youre going to end up with stuff right against the evaporator, so if it were to run for too long at once it would likely freeze some stuff on the top shelf. But anyway, now were just shopping formini-fridges so I think I should wrap it up. The bottom line of this video is that Peltier elements are interesting and cool devices but they're just not good for general purpose cooling. And since weve adopted isobutane as the standard refrigerant in domestic refrigerators, to be honest you can stop feeling guilty aboutbringing another fridge into the world. I mean, you probably shouldn't buy one unless youactually need it (and Im 50/50 on whether Im gonna keep this for storing my color film or donate it so someone else can make better use of it). But really this is just a coolerwhich happens to have a little heat pump in it. The steel and copper in here is the onlyspecial sauce. Ooh, I could keep sauce in here! inefficiently smooth jazz It may look like the teleprompter hasnt started but thats cuz it hasnt. Which to us feels like coldness, and reject ahh.. [clears throat] ehbutehbuDEDABAH Because all the rest have HEAT PUUUuuUuuUUUumps. Woah that was not good. Even if we go with the 633 kilowattanggguhbuhdeblledyaghbleurf Even when it's not running at all. So the higher temperature difference between the cot and dah. ..american energyguide label is very very pessimistic thanks to the way the depart oh debeduh debeduh debbity duh Its flammable which presents some practical challenges especially when ssssssssssssssssshhhwhww welp. So I think we can sum this up pretty well: Peltier elements? Not cool. Oh except they are... on the one side. But not cool as in, like, good. Or hip. Or rizz. Is that what the kids say now? oh no I looked it up and that is NOT RIGHT skibidi heat pump",

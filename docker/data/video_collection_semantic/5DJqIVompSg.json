    "transcript": "(inspirational orchestra music) - Hey, good afternoon everyone, and welcome to CES. Thank you so much for joining us here today. So today, I'm pleased to be here to announce that we are launching six, new, ninth generation core desktop processors, from core i3 all the way up to core i9. We'll also be bringing 9th generation core processors to our mobile family, our H-series line, just next quarter in Q2. Bringing that same high level of performance, for gamers, content creators, productivity, to our mobile H-series line. So, stay tuned for that, we are very, very excited. So, for the first time anywhere in public today, I'm gonna demonstrate, and we're gonna show our Ice Lake, first volume, 10 nanometer client SOC. This is it, right here, this is the Ice Lake in my hand. This is way more than just a CPU, and it's packed with a bunch of firsts. So, to show that off, a little bit, I wanted Chuck to come out and show us Ice lake in action. - We've written a little script here, I'm gonna go ahead and enter on both of these, now, this script is gonna go through, is gonna look at all those hundreds of photos, that I have on each system. And you're gonna see, it's gonna look through all those systems I've put in a category of water. So, it's gonna find all those pictures that I have, that have water. And you're gonna see, with each of these systems, even though I have a core i7 8th gen CPU here, when I bring in the advantages of Ice Lake, it's gonna happen and go through those pictures, much, much faster. - Right. - You're gonna see, actually, in this case, a 1.5x improvement when I go through and look for pictures with water. - That's right, that's right. - Before in the past, when you had a system this thin, this light, you had to sacrifice something. Usually it was, that CPU performance and GPU performance. But now, with Ice Lake, you are now sacrificing nothing. So, we've also got, Thunderbolt on this one system. So, you see one cable, I've got a cable here so you can hear the game, but I've got one cable going to a monitor, keyboard, mouse, an external storage in, and I still have that tremendous (mumbles) graphics performance, (mumbles) this type of gaming solution, all in one simple solution. - So, now you've gotta take a breath, 'cause we did that really fast. You've shown Ice lake in the form factor, great CPU, graphics, AI work-load acceleration, gaming and Thunderbolt 3 integration, all on that package. - Exactly. - Awesome. I'm gonna get a little bit geeky for a minute, so, bear with me. But at the same time, I think you'll appreciate how some of these new technical innovations are helping us bring new value to our partners and users at the same time. So, what I'm gonna talk about now, for the first time anywhere, is one of the first products that take advantage of that architecture and innovation, and that is codenamed Lakefield. I'm gonna show you a little animation, on how Lakefield was put together. We took a new approach, that's allowing us to integrate different CPU core architectures into a single product, and we call that a Hybrid CPU. So, what you are looking at in this animation, is a processor that has five cores, it has a 10 nanometer high-performance Sunny Cove Core, and it's combined with four atom based cores, so you get low power efficiency, immersive graphics, I/O memory, all in this tiny SOC, which is approximately 12mm square. We're pairing this Hybrid CPU architecture, with an innovative 3D packaging approach, that we call Foveros. Where we are able to actually stack different pieces of IP together in three dimensions, instead of just two. So, that SOC is now packed with all the technology in 3D, that people come to expect. Drives longer battery life, performance, connectivity. We can do smaller chips, smaller boards, more efficient, better designs. It's gonna unleash some great performance, some great platform innovations in the industry. And even more innovative devices. So, we're not talking about just a minor decrease in size, I wanted to show you, the Lakefield board, that we've built inside of intel. Here it is, this is Lakefield. On a reference board, that we have done in house. This is our smallest full PC motherboard. - I'm super excited to show you exactly how far we've come with this Lakefield boards. Here you can see, I've got a smaller system, I've got a video up and running, I've also got the display monitor running, so you can see (mumbles) computing display working up there. And I've also got a little larger form factor here, I've got a movie playing, full desktop, OS experience, looking fantastic. - You know, we wanted to go even beyond, and show you Lakefield working in systems today, that it's possible scaling down a very, very low standby power and small designs as he's got there. But also scaling up in performance to a full PC experience. - I'm happy to announce that, we at the tail end of 2018, began shipping our next generation Xeon, codenamed Cascade Lakes. Cascade Lakes, is designed to handle processing the world's data. Today I'm excited to talk about a way in which we are expanding our collaboration with Alibaba. We caught up with Alibaba's Chief Marketing Officer, Chris Tung, just a couple of days ago at their headquarters in Hangzhou, and I'll let him tell you a little bit about it. - [Chris] Alibaba and intel are both worldwide partners of the Olympics. And I'm happy to announce our next collaboration, that will take us there. Alibaba Cloud and intel will deliver the first ever AI powered 3D Athlete Tracking, during the 2020 Olympic games in Tokyo. This groundbreaking technology will provide fast, with more compelling insights into how world-class athletes perform and compare to one another. We are very proud to work with intel to reimagine the future of the Olympics. - We've developed a novel technology concept, called 3D Athlete Tracking. Unlike the way this is done today, there's no special suits, there's no special sensors here, what we're doing is, taking the data from regular cameras, we are applying a AI algorithm, a bunch of compute power, and what you end up is a super accurate digital model of the athlete's performance, and you can imagine that you can analyze that information in many different ways. - We've been working with some great intel engineers, to see just what Xeon processors could do for range AI. Here are two systems running range AI, so, both systems are now tracking the human movement in the video. On the exact same video. With our current solution on a GPU, we're inferencing around 90 frames a second, but on the Cascade Lake platform optimized with the intel DL boost, we are inferencing at 450 frames, which blows my mind. - And so, today, we're announcing that we are expanding our decade-long investments in network infrastructure, with a new network SOC, codenamed Snow Ridge, that is being developed specifically for 5G wireless access. What you see on the animation on the screen is a simulation of the traffic being generated by this machine. It's flowing through Snow Ridge on this machine. What Snow Ridge is able to do is, it's able to differentiate between these different applications, and prioritize the application that is most latency sensitive. In this case, the remote surgery application, literally could mean the difference between life and death, in terms of the responsiveness for that application. You can see that is running at 100 gigabits of traffic, and it's able to prioritize that remote surgery application over the others. This example, for example, imagine a world where a surgeon and a patient could be in a different location, and the surgeon could use a remote robot, that mimics his hands gesture, to instantaneously operate on a patient in a different location. I'm gonna show you another product now on 10 nanometer. Our Ice Lake server silicon that follows Cascade Lake. This is the first time we've demonstrated this publicly, and what you can see here is that, we are running a machine learning simulation, with Ziva dynamic software, and we're using it to create this character, Zeke the lion, on the left, what you can see is a machine learning simulation, that's running on that Ice Lake server, and this is the model that's being used to create this character Zeke. And on the right, what you can see is, the Ziva software that's creating Zeke, layer by layer from the bones to the muscles, to the skin and then finally adding the fur. And you can see how the end result is incredibly lifelike. So, we are very excited about Ice Lake coming to the market in 2020, the follow one, the Cascade Lake. In some, what you've seen over the course of this presentation today, is we've demonstrated for you four products running on our latest 10 nanometer process technology. Ice Lake client, Lakefield client, Snow Ridge for the data center, and Ice Lake for the data center. All having in common the 10 nanometer process technology from the ultra low power in Lakefield, to the highest performance in Icelake. Thank you very much for joining us, have a great CES, thank you.

    "transcript": "- [Krazy Ken] Okay, so recently, kinda out of nowhere, my MacBook Pro started making these lovely sounds. Have a listen. (computer fan buzzing) Yeah, that's pretty great, ain't it? I mean, I'm no rocket engineer, but I'm pretty sure that's the fan. So, we're gonna have to take a look at, take a look at what's going on inside this thing. All right! (chuckles) I'm so excited. (sighs) (gadget beeps) (gadget beeps) (keyboard clicking) (futuristic techno music) All right, so I was gonna experiment with smcFanControl quick, an app I have used before, and now I'm thinking, well, maybe that'll help the issue a little bit. I have no idea, so we're gonna try that. And, oh yeah, screw you frickin' MacUpdate with your fake download buttons. Man, that stuff is just a disgrace to the tech community. I can't believe you would try to do that and think that's okay. All right so, smcFanControl. So the hope is that I can just maybe speed the fan up and then slow it down so the noise stops, 'cause that is really annoying. And if this doesn't work, well, we're gonna have to take it into the lair and try to fix it up. The Curse has struck on me again. Ooh, what is this? Alert! smcFanControl has not been tested on this machine yet. But it should run if you follow the instructions. If you choose to continue, please make sure you have not other FanControl software running. Otherwise please quit, de-install, de-install, okay, the other software, restart your machine, yadda, yadda, yadda. Okay. We are currently spinning at zero RPM, oh there you go, it changed now. All right, 61 degrees Celsius. I am a dumb American and don't understand that, so I gotta change that. I don't have the formula memorized in my head. All righty, let's go to Fahrenheit. Save changes. Oh my gosh! How many times do I have to type in my password? Okay, 142 degrees Fahrenheit, which, I'm no expert, but I don't think that's actually too out of control for a computer with this much power in it, and considering how frickin' thin it is. It's also from 2013. So, yeah, I don't think that's terrible. It doesn't sound like the fans are kicking up any faster, and, like, it doesn't feel any warmer than normal, so even though it's making an annoying sound it doesn't feel any warmer than normal and the fans aren't kicking up any more than normal as well. So that's kind of a good sign. (chuckles) Oh boy. All right, so let's see, right now left side is at 2603, right is at 2417. Now, is that, like, house right, which should be here? Or is it stage right, which would be here? I don't know which one it means. Hopefully this one, 'cause when you have it flipped upside down, the directions are flipped. So I actually don't know what it's referring to. I'll probably figure that out later, or one of you guys can tell me. You're smarter than me, probably. (laughs) Okay, so let's take a look here. So what I could do, I'll say the left side, actually I can control these individually? Really? Oh, well that will help me actually figure out if it is the left or the right, or whatever. Anyway, let's just go like, it's not a full pin it. Let's just go, like, halfway so we don't, like, explode anything. Okay, and we hit save. And, of course, gotta type in my password again because this is a overly worrisome system. Do you think, Macintosh, within the last five seconds some, like, thief got a hold of my computer and wants to turn my fans up? Ah, there's gotta be a way to turn that off! I swear I did not have to do this before. Okay, I can't find a setting to disable that frickin' authorization panel. Very obnoxious. I swear I never had to do that before. Okay, so this must not be working because the setting here is at 37 and we're getting 26. Ah, my gosh, I'm gonna punch you. I'm not doing anything on purpose right now. But it looks like my theory is not gonna be correct anyway. (chuckles) Oh boy, ohhhhh. It's just gonna bust off its bearing and burst through the aluminum and sever my neck. Oh yeah, we're getting really fast now and I don't even have, like, this is set to the minimum. (groans) Gosh, it doesn't sound good. All right, so it looks like I'm gonna have to remove this. Maybe I'll try a different utility. All right, let's, um, let's restart and then we're gonna try a different fan controller and see what's up. And if this doesn't work I'm just gonna remove that fan controller and then we're just gonna go into the lair and rip this thing open. (laughs maniacally) Oh, I'm gonna need a pentabular screwdriver. All right, off to Amazon. So here's what I'm gonna test next. Macs Fan Control, which should, that icon actually looks pretty spiffy. CrystalDEA, D-E-A? Like Drug Enforcement Agency? All right, didn't think they made software, but okay. But see, now listen. (fan whirring) The fans are kicking back up and it's not making that sound. After it shut down and turned back on it stopped buzzing. So what is the variable here as to why it would buzz earlier, shut down, and now it's fine? Even though the fans are clearly spinning faster. Listen, right? But no buzz. Interesting. Well, I'm gonna wait for the buzz to come back and then I'm gonna try out this application. Ah! (laughing) I jinxed it. There it is, right there. Let's see, move to applications. Would you like (mumbling), yeah, sure. Oh, gotta type in a password. Well, this is pretty spectacular. It has all the individual hardware components. Sensor-based value, constant RP, okay. Well, let's just crank it up. Ooh, there we go. (computer buzzing) Yup. Okay, so that is the right fan. All right, now we got that down. So it is house right, okay. Yup, it's still buzzing as you can hear. Let's bring it down to, like, 3800. (computer buzzing) Oh yeah. So adjusting the speed and bringing it back down ain't gonna do jackshit. It's fine for, like, maybe 10 minutes and then it comes back. Oh, it's so annoying. I've had this computer for five years and I've never had a problem. That's, like, the first problem. Software problem, sure. Like, High Sierra, that was a bitch, but hardware issues, no, never. This is the first hardware anomaly I've ever had with this computer. Five years though, no issues, pretty good, right? Let's, uh, I don't know what it was at before. Oh, just auto. Okay, whatever. Let's just crank this other one up. (computer whirring) That's cool, it's like stereo fans. (beat boxing) Yeah, okay, crank this one up. See, the buzzing is actually less annoying when the white noise of both fans at full blast are going. That's actually, it kinda, like, covers it up. That's not good enough for me though, so we're gonna have to take this bad boy apart in the lair. Come and join me. Ken ski-doo, we can too. Okay, it took some doing, but I finally found some time to come down to the laboratory and take a look at this computer on the inside. And by laboratory I mean the government-assigned asylum that is 10 stories underground. But we won't get into that much right now. It involves too much lore. So, let's see, we got a little tool kit here, because these are pentabular screws. Yes, I didn't know what those were until I owned an Apple product either. So we have some beautiful made in China tools that are gonna help us de-pentabulize this computer. Ooh, Chinese plastic. (grunting) Hard to open up. (plastic ripping) Holy frick on a stick, I am so glad those things didn't go flying at, like, a thousand miles an hour. Too bad I don't have my knife down here. And just a reminder, you know, this is in the little disclaimer at the beginning of Krazy Ken episodes, but you know, this is not a directly educational series. This is not supposed to be strictly educational to teach you how to open this stuff up. These are tech video logs. This is me exploring stuff. I am not a repairman, I just play one on TV. Actually I don't even do that, so I'm just here to have some fun, experiment, and maybe fix some things. If you really wanna learn how to fix computer shit, check this guy out. He's way smarter than me. Okay, so we have a helper stick, which, I am not kidding, that is actually what it's called. I looked it up (laughs) I was always wondering what those things were called. We have the cloth-y cloth. And then some doo-dads with the, probably, pentabular bits on them. Phillips, pentabular. And a little screw case. So let's open this bad boy up. The main area we're gonna be concerned with is this proximity. This is the fan that is being naughty. And, to be honest, I don't really expect major results. I don't wanna risk breaking stuff, so I don't know how much I'm actually going to attempt to fix with this thing. I'm trying to take a look on the inside and see if there's any small things I can do. If there's anything I'm not comfortable with doing, well, if this was someone else's machine and I had permission, yes, I would experiment and possibly break things on the show. But since this is my own computer, (chuckles) that I paid for with my own money and have used to make many of these tech video logs for you guys, and, basically, I make my living with it, I am not going to risk breaking it. (chuckles) We're just gonna see what we can do. Actually, now that I realize it, I probably should have done the criss-cross applesauce method for unscrewing this, just like I should do when screwing it back in, so I will do that next when I put it back together. (chuckles) I know there's some of these rules that they're really just rules. Like, oh, you should put the screws in this way and that way, but, to be honest, I don't know if, in the long run, it's going to make a huge difference. I mean, this stuff is pretty solid. I don't think screwing things in a different order is really gonna screw stuff up, no pun intended. But, yeah, I mean, it's good to be safe. Just don't strip your screws, you know? So, yeah, I've never opened this up before. This will be the first time ever. I've had this computer for five years, and this is the first time I had to open it up. The only time I've seen the, oh (bleep), the only time I've seen the inside of it is when it was going through a TSA x-ray thing. The x-ray showed, like, the battery cells and stuff, which was really cool. That was awesome. Okay, so, again, this is the area we're concerned with. Let's peek on the inside. Three, two, one. Let's try that again. Three, two, one. Maybe this is where I'm supposed to use the helper stick. Is there still a screw in here? No, they're all unscrewed. I have no idea if that helper stick is supposed to be used. Okay, it still feels like there's resistance. No, there's no screws. Well, I may need to look up something on iFixit because I don't wanna break this shit. And look at that right there. A repair guide for the right fan. Well that's pretty cool. I'm gonna be definitely reading this. You go play Fortnite or something. I'm just kidding, don't play Fortnite. Well, I don't know why I said that. Drink coffee and read a book. There, there, that's your education for today. Okay, so, apparently, this is actually called a spudger. Okay, well, it was called, like, a helping stick on the Amazon listing, but that was probably a Chinese thing. Also, yes, as I figured, there are different size screws. I believe I separated them in my little box over there, unintentionally, but, yes, if I'm looking at this diagram correct, these are 2.3 millimeter screws, the rest are 3.0 millimeter screws. Huzzah. But, yeah, I'm looking at their thing and I was doing it right. You're supposed to lift by the hinge first, but it's being very stubborn. You bastards. Ah, shit. Finally, goodness gracious! (coughs) Like, a swarm of dust just attacked me. Okay, well, ooh, oh. Oh my gosh! Yeah, that clearly has never been dusted. Well, I mean, obviously, I've never opened this thing up before. Oh, hey, wait a minute. Do they always, do all the covers have numbers written in them like that? That's cool. It's like a, it's like an autograph, except it isn't. Yeah, this is five years of dust. But this is pretty (bleep) cool, actually. Oh, wow, this is actually really fascinating. (chuckles) I always liked how it looks like an angry face, like the battery cells are the, and is this technically considered a cell? I honestly don't know. Again, I'm not an engineer. Yeah, it looks like a frowny face, an angry frowny face. Here's the fans. This is the one that's being bitchy. It looks like we got speakers right there. That looks like the RAM. That's uh, (mumbling) oh man. But the CPU's probably, like, under this thermal thingy somewhere. Again, not an expert. Uh, that's the M.2 SSD. Uh, this is obviously the battery. All six of these things are the battery. Pretty cool. Okay, it doesn't feel loose or anything. It looks really dusty though. Yeah, I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna dust the shit out. Oh my gosh, it's horrible. (laughs) I'm gonna take a look at the iFixit stuff a little bit more though. Well, the further I read down the iFixit instructions, I just don't necessarily see the point in going through with them all the way because I don't have a piece to replace this with. So we're gonna have to do, like, a two-pronged approach here. I would say let's try dusting this stuff out and then boot the computer back up and see if we have the issue again. If the issue does persist, then maybe I need to get a replacement fan, which it looks like iFixit will sell me one for $64.99. I'm gonna track down some compressed air and just (blowing) blow the shit out. I'm a little weary to use that stuff though because, like, I don't wanna, you know, angle it wrong and end up squirting frickin' liquid air, or liquid whatever in here, 'cause when it's compressed it gets cold and it turns into a liquid and I don't wanna liquefy my computer. So, yeah, I'm usually a little cautious with that stuff, but I think it should be doable. In the meantime, let's set this aside and dust this bad boy out. That's fascinating. There's, like, a dust ring from the fan on this side, but it's severely thicker on that side. That's where the problematic fan is 'cause this is the right fan. Huh. I don't know, maybe, I honestly think the fan is, like, off its bearing or something, and it's, like, maybe brushing up against the case? Maybe that's what's causing it to buzz? It's just, like, hitting the aluminum with the fins of the fan? Maybe that's it, 'cause, yeah, it looks like it's been touching. Or at least the dust has been, like, more accumulated on this side because this is way more, like, present than on this side. Interesting. Well, let's give it a good cleaning anyway. You know, now that I think about it, that may not be five years worth of dust because this thing was actually at an Apple repair facility, or, what do they call it? A repair center? Whatever they call it. Yeah, it was there for a logic board replacement, which actually wasn't even needed, and if you want to know what I'm talking about you can actually watch the five-part saga of early Krazy Ken episodes where I dealt with that issue, where I thought it was a hardware issue, but, spoiler alert, three, two, one, it was a software issue this whole time, but since I had the warrantee I had Apple look at it anyway. So they did a logic board replacement and nothing got better, so I was like, okay, it's definitely a software issue, but I figured since I had the repair for free I might as well do it. Yeah, that was several years ago already, so that actually might only be, like, two and a half years of dust as opposed to five years of dust. (chuckles) All right, so time to track down some compressed air. Let's set that to the side over there. I'm gonna see if we can just give this a quick blow job, I guess. That's what Adiblasi calls it. No upgrade would be complete unless you have a proper blow job. What were you all thinking? Disgusting. Well I searched all around the house and could not find any compressed air, so I'm gonna have to give my friend, jubilant Gino, a little call. Hey, Gino, how's it going? Great, yeah, thank you. Um, hey, if you're out and about can you please pick up some compressed air for me. Oh, hey man, I know. Just this one time, and I'll owe you. Okay, thank you, appreciate it. Bye. Well, I called him at the perfect time. What a coincidence. He was actually just near an Office Depot, so he's gonna pick some up for me. And, bon appetit, here we go, cleaning duster. You know, I see some people using this stuff, like, kinda wrong. Like, I see people angle it and shit, like I just did there, actually, now that I think about it. (laughs) Yeah, you shouldn't do that 'cause, you know, compressed air is cold and it turns to liquid, so we don't wanna spray liquid into our computer. So I will not do that again, even though I just did it there. Right, so we'll take the little straw off so we can drink it. Ah, just, actually... I don't know if that was supposed to come off. (laughing) That came off, like, really easily. I don't know if that was supposed to come off or not. Oh, good. Oh, okay, um... (air hissing) There we go. All right, we are up and running. So, also, because I am 10 stories underground with very inadequate ventilation, I have an ionizer right over there, there, that is going to basically help purify the air and, like, collect all the dust particles. 'Cause once I spray this bitch into that bitch, I'm sorry, computer, I just called you a bitch, it's gonna get messy. It's gonna get dusty, so we need some kinda ionizer to help clean the air. So let's do that. I'm gonna head over here, boot this sucker up. And if that doesn't work I'll just use a good old-fashioned vacuum cleaner to suck up the dust. Not from the computer, just from the air. Using the vacuum cleaner on the computer would be kinda silly. I just have to position the computer in a way where I can spray this stuff vertically because you should always keep the canister perpendicular to the ground. You don't wanna hold it horizontal, and you don't wanna shake it because then you might spray liquid out of the frickin' nozzle, and you don't wanna spray liquid into the motherboard, trust me. All right, ladies and gentlemen, this is our target. Let's take 'em out with extreme pork chop. (air hissing) It's like Christmas, it's snowing! (air hissing) (yelping) All right, I'm glad I had my shirt over my nose. Should probably wear some goggles. (laughs) It's, like, snowing in here. All right. (air hissing) All right. (air hissing) Okay, well that was fun. Let's nip this in the bud a little bit. (air hissing) That looks pretty good. (air hissing) I think that's about it for that side. Let's flip her over. All right, round two, fight! (air hissing) That dust right there is really not wanting to move. (air hissing) That's looking much better than it did, you know, 10 minutes ago. (air hissing) Looking shiny, boys. Well the ionizer must be working, 'cause there's not a lot of dust floating in the air. Uh, cool. So it looks like we still have some on the fan here. (air hissing) It is not wanting to come out though. (air hissing) Let's go like that. (air hissing) There we go, come on, get out of there, boy. (air hissing) Some of that dust is just stubborn. (air hissing) That's looking a bit better. (air hissing) Good enough for government work. I don't work for the government, by the way. Actually I kinda do, I'm a secret agent. Ah, shoot, more lore. Dang it. I'm just getting a stool sample. Ow, nope, there we go. Stool. Okay. Ah, hoo, hoo, hoo, it's on wheels. That's some dangerous shit. Man, I'm so glad OSHA doesn't exist ten stories underground. They don't have any jurisdiction down here. (fake laughs) Okay, so let's get this bad boy reassembled here. It looks 10,000 times better. There's, like, a thread there, okay. Cool. Oh, there's, like, a thread here too. I don't know if that's normal or not. Shoo. Very nice. And these shorter screws, these shorter pentabular screws go in the back. Okay, they are so freakin' tiny. Oh my gosh. Wonder if the screwdriver's magnetic. I don't think it is. Oh, it is magnetic! Whoo, we're living in the future! Or the present, really. Small victories. I guess I'm just extra happy today because it's my birthday. It actually is. It's my birthday and I'm down here, underground, just like most other days. Happy birthday to me. It's The Curse, right? The Curse, you know, The Curse has screwed me over before and has brought me some really crazy projects, but this time he's gone too far. Like, he struck my daily driver. I mean, I know it's happened before, but I've never had to physically tear the computer open before. Yeah, this time it's personal, Curse. You struck my daily driver on a hardware level. You will pay for that. All right, now we're done with the 2., I think those are 2.3 millimeter screws, now we're on to the 3 millimeter screws for the remaining eight holes. Not too bad for a cheap Chainor tool, right? Made in Chainor. Oh, (chuckles) think I just scratched the aluminum there. Hopefully I can buff that out. Frick on a stick. I mean, the bottom's already scratched up a bit anyway. I've used it for five years. And there we go. Criss-cross applesauce, all the screws in place. Bon appa-tit, we are done. Hopefully this worked. Time to flip it over and then head rotate it, (chuckles) and, uh, boot it up, and, uh, hope it works. And while we're at it, you might as well give the screen a little cleaning. At least, you know, without any solution, like, liquid solution. I have glass cleaner, like screen cleaner. I'm just not using it right now. I just thought I'd use the little cloth that came with the tools. Can't really fix the film coming off at the top though because that was an Apple defect. Good job, Apple. But, that's okay, I still kinda love you. And, yeah, all pretty. Let's boot her up. (computer boot-up chime) All right, so we're at the desktop and I do have a little fan controller, as I showed you earlier. The issue doesn't seem to happen all the time, especially when you just turn the computer on or wake it up from sleep mode. It usually only happens once the fans start speeding up a bit. And this, (laughs) this towel is dusty. I'm gonna have to make sure that really gets washed. Oh my gosh. It was a bloodbath of dust. I'm gonna invoke a higher fan speed and we're gonna see what happens. Let's just go full speed ahead. Okay, I'm not gonna lie, they sound a little different. I mean, I am also on a towel. That might be muffling the sound a little bit, but they sound a little different. Is that because the dust is off the fans? They now sound, like, better because there's no dust on the fans? That actually changed the sound. I mean, it makes sense. Yeah, let's skip that for now. Go back to auto. Huh, so far, nothing. I don't wanna jinx it, but so far, nothing. I'm gonna let it sit for a bit. I'm gonna take this towel out from here and we'll give it another test. This time I'm gonna take my phone and just kinda lay the microphone, running voice memos, by the way, right over where the fan is so we can record the sound better and listen for any defects. All right, so let's bump up the left. Bump up the right, and have a listen. (computer whirring) So far, so good. It's sounding better than it has in a long time, even before the buzzing issue. Like, it just sounds, sounds more like a jet. Like a (whooshing) instead of like a (growling). It sounds more like a (whooshing). You want your computer to (whooshing), not (growling), you know? (notification bell dinging) (growling) bad, (whooshing) good. (whooshing) There, you learned something today. Yeah, it's sounding good. Let's slow 'em down. Yeah, they sound great. I also listened to the phone recording, just to get a more amplified sound. I don't hear anything bad. Well, I'll keep an ear on it and if something happens we'll probably replace the fan itself, but I'm calling this a win. I kinda didn't think that would work, just getting the dust out of there. That was really fun and we made it snow. (laughs) Yeah, man, thanks for tagging along with me. I'm glad we got this fixed together because it was a little annoying and happy birthday to me. Yaaaa-aaaaaay. Hey, that's a good birthday present. Canned air. Thanks, Gino. Catch the crazy and pass it on. (futuristic techno music)",

    "transcript": "(light music) - Hey guys, it's Justine. Today we're checking out the brand new drone by DJI. This is the brand new DJI Mini 3 Pro and I am such a huge fan of DJI. And one of the things that I'm most excited about this drone is the fact that it is so small, so portable, so compact, and it's still comes in at under 249 grams, which means you don't have to register this with the FAA. So I have the drone and I also have their Fly More Kit Plus. So this comes with a bunch of accessories with the charger, batteries, propellers. And of course the Mini 3 Pro controller not included, in comparison to the previous version, this has improved battery life, intelligent features, video transmission, and a fully upgraded imaging system and visual sensing system. Now one of the most important things to note is the weight of this drone is 249 grams, which is under the weight limit that you would need to actually register it with the FAA. And as a one in one third image sensor that supports HDR, it has three directional obstacle sensing and an upgraded pilot assistance system. Now the battery, you can get up to 34 minutes of flight time but if you have the intelligent flight battery plus, you will actually get 47 minutes of flight time. That is just absurd. This is also able to transmit up to 12 kilometers and it features some of my favorite intelligent shooting features like focus track, time lapse, master shots. And this also brings back the possibility of vertical shooting. So TikTok, you guys better get ready for some incredible drone shots. All right. Let's unbox the drone first. I have to be very careful with knives because I'm on blood thinners. Put that far away. Oh, look at this. Oh, wait a minute. I thought the controller didn't come with it. Oh my goodness. What a treat this is. I thought that was just like, hey, so like you can use this pro controller with it, but no. Excuse me. Look at this. Wow. We're going out to fly tonight. Oh, this feels so good. Look at that. Tonight we fly baby. That's nice. Propellers. Oh, look at this. A little screwdriver. Some paperwork. Look at that. A little pamphlet of don't be a drone idiot. This is very exciting. I did not realize that the controller came with it. Oh my goodness. I love this. All right little drone. Let's see what you look like. Very carefully use my knife. Oh, this actually looks different than the previous version. It looks like a little alien spaceship. Look how freaking cute this is. I can actually put this in my yoga pants. No joke. I have pockets. Like not actually in my yoga pants pockets, just to preface. Charge to activate. Wait is the battery in here already? Wait, there can't be a battery in this. Oh my God. This is the battery. This is so freaking light. Get out of here. But obviously flight times do vary depending upon your weather condition. So if it is really windy you're getting get a little less flight time because the drone is having to do a little bit more work to compensate for how windy it is. But wow. I just can't believe how small this is. I mean, the controller is heavier than this. So the one thing that's interesting is you actually do need to screw the propellers in. Normally they just kind of pop into place. So that's kind of interesting that they decided to go that route, which I mean, I don't hate it unless I run into a tree and I need to take out my props. Let's see what is in our Fly More Kit Plus box. Nice little bag. Love that. You've got some extra batteries here. I love this little charging dock too. How cool. That's nice. Oh, something's in here. Oh, more propellers, additional cabling. Oh, we're gonna be so set. What's in here? Just more instructionals. So these are the upgraded batteries that will give you a longer flight time. But as you can see this on here says this is the ultralight version of the battery. So this is how you'll be able to stay under that 249 grams. But if you do use the upgraded batteries, that's where you are going to need to register your drones. So it's kind of like one of those little gray areas, but if you do want to fly longer and use these additional batteries, you will still need to register it. So that being said, I'm gonna charge these batteries up, update my firmware and get this all set up and go out and fly. Okay. We are out and about. And inside of my little baggy here is a drone and a controller and two batteries. I know it's freaking awesome. We're down here in Venice. It is actually pretty busy. It's a Friday night. We're gonna take off, see how this little drone flies. This looks like a nice spot. I love having this integrated screen in the controller. That's super exciting. So small. (upbeat music) (light music) All right. So I switched the camera to vertical. Let's get ourselves a TikTok. I'm a professional. Let me live, let me live my life. So honestly, my first flight with this was really awesome. It's actually pretty windy today at the beach and this thing handled it like a freaking champion. I also didn't even put a full 100% battery in this. I had already done firmware updates before I left the house. So it was kind of wild that this lasted a very, very long time. So I swapped batteries and now I'm gonna take some photos. First I'm gonna take a photo, there's sphere 180 wide angle and vertical. So let's take a sphere photo. And there it is. Oh my gosh. It looks so cool. I'm saving that. (upbeat music) So this was so far out there, getting these shots of these boats and it was so windy on shore, I can only imagine that it was even more windy out there and this thing handled it like a champ. Like I didn't even feel like it was struggling at all. So all things considered, this little guy is so awesome. I absolutely love it. And I just love how small, portable, compact. I love this controller. I'm so excited to take this with me pretty much everywhere which I don't really go anywhere. But next time I do, you're coming with me. Thank you guys so much for watching. Hope you guys enjoyed this.

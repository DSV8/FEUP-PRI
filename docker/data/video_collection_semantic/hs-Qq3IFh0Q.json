    "transcript": "- You know what's better than one gaming chair? Two gaming chairs. And I'm excited today to finally be unboxing the Herman Miller Logitech Vantum Gaming Chair. And the reason I'm excited about it is because this is the first gaming chair from Herman Miller that is designed specifically for gamers which, I'm kind of a gamer myself, so. Let's see how this goes. Let's start with the box. Open here, away from the top. Ready to play. Just three steps stand between you and the next level of ergonomics. Simply place the seat onto the base install the headrest and then follow the QR code to adjust the chair to your exact specifications. That is awesome. So for $995 I don't even have to really assemble the chair. It's like, pretty much ready to go out of the box which is really cool. Do I even need this beautiful JerryRig Everything Knife from LttStore.com? I don't know. Do I even need to do this video? I don't know but we're gonna find out. Yo, that is such a spoiler. - [Hoffman] Do that again! - Yo, even just moving that it glides. That felt so good. And I was just moving the base of the the base of this chair. I like the amount of recyclable cardboard that they're using. One of the cool things about this chair is that on all their marketing materials they're saying that this chair is not designed to be replaced. I think they said about 90% of the chair can be recycled at its end of life. And Herman Miller chairs, at least this one in particular comes with a 12 year warranty which is really cool. Phantom Gaming chair. Okay. It's a picture of the chair. I think that's what it's supposed to look like when I'm done building it. Anything else in this box? Nothing. Hi-yah! That didn't do anything. Okay, and now we basically got the rest of the chair. This is gonna be really difficult. Make sure to follow closely. Follow closely, everyone. (Colton grunting) Wow, that was really difficult. I think that's how it's supposed to be. (Colton laughing) Let me actually look at the instructions. So, we assembled the chair under the base correctly. Insert the headrest into the chair back slot. I think I just need to push. There's a little plastic clip here and I'm kind of wondering if this is supposed to be here or not. Oh my gosh. Okay. Holy crap! (Colton laughing) I just didn't know how much force to apply putting that down. Okay, we're good. And then step four of the installation instructions is to just sit on it. And that's how you complete the, the assembly. Bum drop on it. Make sure the base is really in there. And that's it. If I knew how to install the headrest I probably would've took less than 60 seconds to actually install, which is really good. Now we're gonna do the other one. Should we speed run it? - [Hoffman] You did. - I could do it. - [Hoffman] Two, one, go! (Colton grunting) - Oh no. Another thing I have to open with my knife. This is honestly gonna take the longest. I hope you're actually timing me. - [Hoffman] You gotta review it. What is it? - What? - [Bell] Yeah, you gotta review that. (Colton laughing) - This is fantastic, I love it. Ooh, I like this color. It's very nice. Little bit of contrast. This chair comes in three colorways. Comes in black obsidian. Uh, dang it. I forgot what the other ones are called. What? No, it's not. It comes in a black, black and red and a black and white. (Colton laughing) (Colton grunting) How long did that take? That was like 60 seconds, right? I think I like the contrast of the white colorway. So we're gonna go with that for our initial kind of design impressions here. You'll notice by looking at the chair it's leaning a little bit forward. And that's because it's got an active forward leaning alignment to get you to naturally sit up straight and sit a little bit more forward. Which is supposed to be better for you back. I like the just, chill nature of it. I already talked a bit about how smooth it seems to glide, which is great. The Phantom features a glass-filled nylon base and frame. Alex just walked by. Alex, what's so cool about glass-filled nylon? - I don't really know. I just know that high-end tools use it. (everyone laughing) - That's enough for me. - I think it helped with durability a lot. - Oh, okay, that's sick. So the other thing is that it has recycled polyester fabric. This is interesting. When I first touched the armrest I thought they were like a hard ABS plastic but they're like a foam. It's a polyurethane skin foam and it actually is like, hard and soft at the same time. It's a little tough to describe, but it's cool. What, what are these names, dude? Skin foam. (Colton laughing) You notice on the rear IO of this chair you've got a adjustable headrest which kind of went through before I was having issues installing it. But now that it's in it's good. It has just the right amount of give when you're adjusting it. It's also got thoracic support pads as well as this kind of spinal support system here. And at long last, I'm gonna sit on this chair. I would love to tell you how I'm feeling right now. Right after a word from our sponsor, Corsair. Thanks to Corsair for sponsoring this video. Corsair's Voyager A1600 Laptop combines the latest eight core, 16-thread AMD Ryzen 6,000 series processor AMD Radeon RX 6,800M graphics and AMD smart technologies. Map streaming commands and keyboard shortcuts to 10 customizable shortcut buttons using Elgato's Stream Deck software with drag and drop customization. It's thin and compact. Your game streams and creativity can go mobile. So click the link below and learn more about the Corsair Voyager A1600 today. (Colton laughing) I can say, with real honesty I've never been so comfortable reading sponsor read before. This chair is comfortable. This LttStore.Com polar fleece is comfortable. I'm just comfortable. I'm just relaxed. I don't even know what else to say. Let me actually sit up straight. Try adjusting the armrest. They kind of just go. There's no buttons or anything that you press. Oh yeah, there are. Sorry, that's a lie. So I can go up and down. I can go forward and backward very easily. I don't think you can go 4D. I don't think you can turn them unless I'm wrong. I don't think these turn left to right. Oh, they go like that, though. Hey! Back is supported. Let me play with some of the dials here. Think this just adjusts tension for the spinal support system. I felt it moving for a little bit before then I heard a horrifying noise. Now I'm wondering if I broke it. Bell, can you just slide me the other chair? Okay, it's good. All right, I was freaking out for nothing. So the amount of movement that the lumbar sports system does is just as simple as, boop. I do like that you can adjust it on either side. I'm glad that they have these. So if you're left-hand or right-handed you can easily change it. It's just not complicated, which is really nice. On your right side, you'll find the tension adjustments that goes from one to six adjusting the tension for the recline. And then on the left side here we'll find the tilt limiter. So six means this is as far back as I can go. And if I turn it down to one I'm assuming I can't go back at all which is correct. Few more things. It's got this seat depth adjustment which is on the right side here as part of the actual seat. I can't seem to get it to work. I don't know if I'm just like, doing it wrong. - [Bell] Is it already all the way out? - I don't know. Hold on, let me try to go back here. - [Bell] Two guys thrusting. - We're trying to figure this out, folks. Bear with us. Technical difficulties. - [Hoffman] Could you both do it at the same time? (everyone laughing) - I don't know, man. I don't know, dude. - In theory, it it switches forward. - Okay, we got it. It turns out both of our chairs were already fully extended. So this is the chair in its back form. Again, remember what I said? This whole chair is designed to have you sitting upright and forward for long gaming sessions. Okay, so now I'll actually adjust it and move forward. Boop, there we go. That's how that's supposed to work. And then the last thing that we need to find is the seat height adjustment. This is it in its lowest state. This is it in its highest state. And I'm short. So we're going back down. At this point in the video you might be wondering how much does this thing cost? Well, let me tell you, it costs $995 US which is a lot of money for a chair, don't get me wrong. But it's actually less than the Herman Miller Embody. And honestly, chairs in my experience are one of those things that you kind of get what you pay for. I have an Amazon Basics Ergo chair at home that I paid $150 Canadian for and it is completely trashed. I've had it for a year. I need to get another one. My experience with Herman Miller chairs at work, though have been that they last. We have Herman Miller chairs here that we've had for years. And I would hope that this chair could also stand the test of time, as well. The Herman Miller Embody Gaming chair that I'm sitting in right now retails for 1795 USD. You can sometimes get it on sale. It's on sale right now. The Vantum is only 995 USD. And honestly, for the cost savings, I would go with this. This, you're gonna get more customization. It looks more badass. But this just seems straightforward, minimalist. I just like it more. Lastly, let's get gaming and let's get some other people to game, too. When I game, I have a tendency to lean back and this chair is not allowing me to do so and I don't say that in a negative way. I mean, I just feel actually supported. And the fact that I can set the lean tension and the lean limit means I can get to the right amount of comfy, you know? Let's get some other people. Geoff, do you game? Geoff, what chair do you use at home? - I use the Razer Iskur that you did a first look on. - Oh. - [Geoff] On ShortCircuit like two years ago. - Do you like it? - I enjoy it. The lumbar support's kind of cool. I get kind of sweaty because like that pleather stuff. - Yeah. - This looks kind of good. - Take this for a test drive, my friend. - Let's run it. My butt feels supported. Ooh, playing games. My arms feel, you know, at the right level, I think. My feet are on the ground. - Would you pay 995 US dollars for it, though? - Honestly, yes. For a Herman Miller that's pretty good. I hear that their warranty's really, really good. So, I'm sure this will last me a lifetime of gaming. - Wow. - Maybe, maybe. - Didn't even pay the guy. Didn't even pay the guy. All right, next up, let's go. We've got the biggest gamer in the house. - I don't know about that. - I don't know. No, I just, we've got Plouffe. - Hey, that's good enough. - He sits. This man sits. - I like to sit. - I like to sit. - I like to sit down. - You're a keyboard guy. You have to sit for the keyboard, right? - Yeah. - What do you have? What kind of chair do you have right now? - [Plouffe] I have a Herman Miller Mirra at home. - [Colton] Oh, okay. Yeah, nice. How do you like it? - I like it a lot. I got the Steelcase Series one or whatever for my Intel upgrade and I changed it out almost immediately. Because you know what? As much as they're a big competitor to Herman Miller it's, it's not the same. - One thing I will say is around the office we do have Steelcase and we have Herman Millers. And anyone that sees a Steelcase is like can I have a Herman Miller? And I'm not even trying to be rude. I love Steelcase chairs. They're great. But yeah, it just is what it is. I dunno. - So the one thing, oh no, it does. Okay, so it's got like four directional arm rests. - It does, yeah. I thought it didn't, but it does. - Can these angle though? - I don't think so. I have not been able to get them to angle. - Okay, that's disappointing. I don't know. It's good. Seems comfortable. - Cool. - I'm sitting down for a little while and I'm not uncomfortable. So, yeah. - Beautiful. All right, next up. Next up! Next up. Sit in the chair, Linus. - [Jake] You've got 30 seconds, Linus. - Yeah, you're a chair guy, right? - This thing sucks. - Plouffe has no taste. (Colton laughing) No taste at all. I'm totally kidding. - What chair do you have at home, Linus? - Got the Secret Lab whatever one that we have on The WAN show. - [Colton] oh, Secret Lab, okay. - [Jake] An L beta plywood with foam on it. - Okay, this actually does not have, uh this actually does not have great butt support. I have a bit of a thicker caboose and I can I can feel, a the, what would you call this? These are bolsters. What's, what's this? - [Jake] Ass bolsters. - Yeah, ass bolsters. - Ass bolsters. - The ass bolsters are not quite wide enough for my load. And B, like I can immediately feel the plastic or plywood or whatever it is under it. - Have you sat in the Embody chair before, Linus? - Uh yeah, that one is pretty good. - Okay, so that one is almost double the price. This is 995. That's 1795. - I don't think I would have ever thought that I would recommend the $1700 chair but if the other option is this. Are other people saying it's good? Other than Plouffe who apparently has an ass made of steel. - Jeff said it was good. I don't know if we can trust Jeff. - I don't think the ass bolsters are really a problem. it's more just I can feel the bottom. - [Linus] Yeah, you're sitting on a plank, man. - Hmm. - [Linus] The foam's not firm enough. - I think it's just so firm that it feels like the plank. Oh yeah, I can feel it. - [Linus] No, that's the plank. - Interesting. - Yeah. We're getting strong plank-adge factor right now. - You heard it here. At the end of the day, it's a chair. It's all gonna come down to personal preference. You're not gonna be able to please everybody. - Unless they're your mama. - Oh, I knew he was gonna do it. (Colton laughing) Anyways, thank you very much for watching this video. Make sure to check out some of my other chair unboxings. Make sure to like, get subscribed. We'll see you on the next one. Your mama. I knew it. That was good.",

We set out to counter the 2018 trend by building an RGB-free affordable Ryzen 2 gaming PC that focuses more on cool component design than on lighting.  The result is a pretty cool setup.....BUT we realized that some tasteful lighting is needed for the best effect.  In the end, this thing looks amazing with or without the lights on!

    "transcript": "what's up guys Eber here with Hardware Canucks and it feels like a long time since I've done a gaming PC build video on the channel so what did I do well I built a gaming PC but this time with a little bit of twist you see it's 2018 I get it people really care about RGB you know if they're trying to build a gaming PC they probably look for a component with RGB lighting whether that's you know motherboard RAM CPU cooler fans GPU case the list just keeps going on but I wanted this bill to be RGB free at least I tried to achieve that in the beginning by choosing components that were pretty affordable that had unique designs in terms of aesthetics but at the end I actually had to add a few RGB fans to make the build pop a little bit and as you can see it's not overly done it's pretty subtle so I kind of like the way how it is it's not glowing with RGB lighting so it's pretty low-key but it does showcase V aesthetics and I want to focus this built primarily on aesthetics not lighting but aesthetics so asu's decided to team up with a few key players in the gaming industry to expand their top gaming brand so this includes brands like Coolermaster Corsair team group memory and a few more to promote their tough branding it's actually one of the main reasons why I thought this PC would look amazing without lighting the colors just all go together so well what's really unique about this build is that the theme is sort of consistent across the board but most importantly it's got some serious power under the hood and it costs less than $1,500 which is definitely you know if not super expensive but relatively along the lines of getting you the best you know sort of gaming performance along with aesthetics because a lot of people care about that these days so we didn't want to cheap out on a lot of components but we also wanted to sort of create a balance between again the performance and physical looks so without any further ado let's check this out but first a quick message from our sponsor so you're looking for something with class good value comfortably populated an ATX motherboard are you it's all about the users and great airflow who knew your temperatures would drop that low route the cables behind the cover illuminate your hardware with built-in LEDs the age 500 I is for you to discover this one's in real life not in your dreams say hello to the link below the aged 500 series from NZ XD is a go alright so the choice for my CPU was the Rison 520 600 X that costs around 230 dollars it features six cores with 12 threads comes with the base conquer 3.6 gigahertz with a boost up to 4.2 this should be plenty enough for gaming as well as some light content creation thanks to the inclusion of 12 threads plus with a little bit of aura clocking we might be able to squeeze just again a little bit of performance out of the CPU housing the 2600 X is the Asus top x4 70 + gaming motherboard and to be honest this component was an inspiration for the whole tough themed build because the PCB features this cool digital camouflage with the light orange accents giving it quite the unique look I especially love how the right side of the board has this angular cutout and that just adds to the aesthetics of this whole build now being a tough series board expect high-quality components like ESD cards to prevent electrostatic discharge tough chokes that delivers steady power to the CPU tough capacitors and MOSFETs the i/o is fairly limited but it should be adequate enough to power your peripherals and other accessories there are two MDOT two slots with one of them supporting PCIe nvme drives and a whole bunch of other features that make this a solid x4 70 motherboard now to cool the 2600 X I could have easily gone with the included weights pyre cooler out of the box but if you recall watching my Rison 526 our next review I wasn't actually able to overclock the processor with the included cooler because it just wasn't able to adequately cool the CPU so I had to go with an aftermarket solution in order to get some results so given that this is a tough team build I picked this the cooler master master air ma 620 P top gaming Edition that was a mouthful but none of the less it really complements a tough motherboard because it's got the digital camouflage that perfectly matches the motherboard plus the included fans feature the light orange accents and given the duel tower heatsink design you should have a problem overclocking the 2600 ex bus it should keep the CPU relatively cool now the fans do come with RGB lining but for the sake of simplicity with this build I'll be disabling that on this cooler moving on to memory and this was a no-brainer I knew exactly what I needed for this build because this kit caught everyone's attention at Computex so I had to get my hands on it right away meet the team group T force Vulcan tough condition 16 gigabyte ddr4 kit clonked at 3000 megahertz it doesn't have any fancy RGB lining but it does feature the tough branding with the camouflage that again looks very unique compared to the competition and given its weighted speeds it should help a little bit with performance okay so for storage I chose the Toshiba RC 100 240 gigabyte nvme SSD what's really fascinating about this drive is its form factor and the performance you get for the price this little guy costs less than $80 and sports read speeds well over 1.6 gigabytes per second and write speeds over a gigabyte per second again 480 dollars and that's incredible considering that there are SATA based SSDs in the market for the exact same cost toshiba was able to do this by leveraging their expertise in NAND flash to design an entire SSD that fits within a single BGA package featuring their state-of-the-art 3d by CS flash that delivers fast performance in a power efficient manner and there's also the form factor it's very tiny and cute coming in at just 42 millimeters in length plus installing it on the motherboard should be a breeze for storing my game library Western Digital 4 terabyte blue caviar hard drive should do the trick one of the cool features with AMD's x4 7e platform is the inclusion of AMD's store mi technology and this essentially creates an array combining your nvme SSD or SATA basicity whatever that is with the traditional mechanical hard drive and of course the RAM to sort of create this single operating system drive that it reads as a whole Drive so this actually reduces game load times it accelerates performance so I do plan on investigating store mi on a later video and of course see how it plays out in terms of real-world performance and perhaps compared to Intel's offering which is obtained so definitely stay tuned for that video but store mi should translate really well with this bill because we've got P R C 100 which is a fast nvme SSD along with a 4 terabyte gigantic hard drive so all in all if we find a way to sort of optimize this system and by using a feature I think we're looking at a pretty awesome system for a really good price and now onto my GPU of choice I chose these Strix gtx 1066 gigabyte in fact this is a discontinued card as of right now and it was the only one i had lying around the studio so i just decided to throw it in its direct cu2 design is pretty awesome with the wing blade fans that stay silent during idle operations boost clocks are expected to go well over 1800 megahertz it doesn't come with any fancy RGB lighting which is pretty much what we wanted and while the red accents might be a bit of a mismatch it won't really show once we've installed a GPU inside the case and as i mentioned earlier it is a discontinued card so i'll leave links to some alternative components down in the description I think a really cool alternative to the Strix GTX 1060 is the EVGA 1060 superclocked Edition it costs less than three hundred dollars it's a six key buy variant it's super compact and it should really go well with the build because again it doesn't have any RGB lining and it's also pretty affordable now that being said I'm actually a little bit disappointed with aces not being able to launch a GPU with the tough branding because they're the ones who sort of started this whole series so it doesn't make sense as to why they haven't come out with a graphics card featuring the tough of color scheme because it would have looked awesome I mean imagine a GPU with the tough with a shroud and the digital camouflage with the orange accents man that would have definitely suited this build but perhaps we could expect that with the new GPU launches that we're sort of hearing about that in the rumors so yeah we'll see powering the whole system is the cooler master master watch 750 tough gaming addition power supply this is yet another product from the top gaming Alliance and you can clearly see that with the exterior design it's a semi modular PSU with an 80 plus bronze certification and it should be plenty enough to power the entire system and it gives you a little bit of room for upgrade ability down the road but it's also super quiet and during idle and load operations the case of choice is the cooler master master box 500 top gaming Edition 88 enclosure this wraps up the styling of the entire PC with the camouflage imprints pretty much everywhere so that includes the front panel the close to side panel as well as the main tempered glass panel it really does look amazing in person and even better with a fully functioning PC inside and it doesn't really require a ton of RGB line components to highlight the exterior design as you can still achieve that non RGB look and it'll highlight the tough branding really well during the daytime where there's lots of natural light there's plenty of airflow for both intake and exhaust no restrictions whatsoever and for $80 this is certainly a unique a/c in the market so now that you've taken a look at the parts list for this PC let's actually put it together actually it's built already sitting right behind me duh but I happen to film the b-roll or I happen to film some b-roll of me putting it together so let's that's the world of montage and so here is the final system boy does it look very unique in my opinion in fact it's probably one of my favorite pcs that I've ever built here in the office certainly enjoying the way how it looks the digital camouflage around the build including the motherboard the cooler and the RAM just really adds to the overall aesthetics of this PC and it really does look amazing there's again plenty of room for upgrade ability down the road and of course the lack of RGB makes it certainly look unique in good lending conditions you can easily spot the orange or light yellow accents from the memory the cooler and the motherboard the GPU not so much but it is what it is and I like that now as I mentioned in the beginning of this video I actually decided to add a few RGB fans to the build to add a subtle effect not super glowing but to add some character to the build and the end result has definitely grown on me in this case I replaced the stock fans that came with a chassis with thermal takes ring plus fans and what's interesting about this set is its muted glow effect on the frame rather than the spill effect you get with some other fans through the blades it looks really stealth and I like that the good thing is that it doesn't take away anything in terms of aesthetics but rather I think it gives an extra 10 to 20 points just for looks I'm aware that I started this build with the RGB free theme in mind but needless to say I have fallen for RGB in a good way at least I think but what you guys think RGB on or RGB off let me know in the comments down below and the last thing to discuss here is performance I did manage to overclock the Rison five 2600 X to four point one five gigahertz at one point for two of eyeballs using the Indies rice and master software fairly intuitive process you just have to open the software bump up the voltage and of course the frequencies well hit apply and you're set to go super simple love how the way it works and I did also manage to overclock the memory to 3000 megahertz I did not experience any BSO DS while stress testing so that's fantastic and really just proves the fact that memory compatibility with the Rison is definitely maturing so that's good news but I also did manage to come pair of run some synthetic tests and compare the stock versus overclocked setting to see if we're actually getting some performance so let's kick things off with Cinebench r15 and as you can see there is a slight improvement in terms of performance so you're looking at 1333 at stock settings compared to 1401 moving on to the Adobe Media encoder test I took a 12-minute 4k project with GHI footage and I exported it to the YouTube 4k precent and in stock settings the system took 23 minutes and 50 seconds compared to 22 minutes and 27 seconds with the overclock and it's not a significant difference because you're only looking about a little over a minute of a difference which isn't that significant but you will certainly notice the rendering decrease if you go with something like the 2700 X and now on to some gimme performance and I'm gonna give you guys a heads up don't expect a significant improvement in terms of frame rates when compared to stock and overclocked because as you can see with 3d mark firestrike there isn't a significant difference with both stock and overclocked setting we have battlefield 1 and 1080p set to ultra settings and as you can see pretty much identical results and then moving on to overwatch at 1080p and epoch the same story realized that you're only looking at 1 FPS difference which is just nothing and then we have doom at 1080p set to ultra using the Vulkan API and stock settings we got 120 8.5 compared to one twenty nine point two with the overclocked saying so again not a significant difference in that title as well so it really comes down to GPU restrictions because this case we are using a 1060 so that's certainly a factor to consider but most importantly you know what start saying is this the frequencies are actually over 4 gigahertz because you've got XFR to running the background so you could technically leave your CPU running at stock speeds and that should yield ooh about the same performance when compared to overclock so technically you could have gone with the right spot color but you know I just decided to go with something a little bit more tough themed so that's that CP temperatures are respectable I'd say so I used hardware monitor to monitor the CP temps and used Ida 64 FP low tests to stress tester CPUs for 15 minutes and it's talked the CPU was idling around 30 foresee with a low temp of 75 C and an overclocked obviously that bumped it up because we're running at one point four to five volts and as you can see an idle were hovering around forty six degree Celsius and eighty-eight degrees Celsius under Ludd which is actually not that impressive considering it's an air cooler so temperatures are definitely not favoring for this kind of an overclock setting for the 2600 X and of course the cooler master air cooler so having looked at the gaming performance comparing the stock versus overclocked setting it's clear or it's actually makes a lot more sense to leave the CPU at stock settings because really not getting that much of a performance and you can certainly expect lower temperatures now it also did manage to monitor the GPU core frequencies on the strict GTX 1060 which is discontinued at the moment but interestingly enough it actually the maximum achievable clock that I got was nineteen forty nine megahertz which is insane considering the form factor and the size so that's pretty awesome and that about wraps up this video I hope you enjoyed this one in fact I had a lot of fun building this PC because I didn't have to worry about a lot of RTV components and playing around with the lighting cables and all that kind of stuff super just it's just a super simple build and file that thermaltake fans were actually easier to install because it was just one controller box that plugs into the USB 2.0 header and that was it I didn't have to worry about plugging in the fan cables to the motherboard because everything is controlled via the controller box easily tuck that away on the backside so it just works right away I'd love to hear your thoughts on this build what are your what's your take on the whole top gaming Alliance and the way how asus is sort of collaborating with these key players like Coolermaster corsair team group memory and a few more love to hear your thoughts on that if I were to change one thing with this build that would be the power supply not specifically the power supply by itself but the cables now it is a semi modular power supply I really wish it if it was fully modular so I could have come with something like Hakeem wants custom extensions with the orange and black sleeves so that would have looked really awesome with this build but that's the only thing that I wish I would have changed also let me know what you guys think about the performance of this PC I'm more specifically would you have swamped one component for another and of course if you have any alternatives I'd love to take a look at that in the comments also links to purchase all these components will be in the description down below so you scribed to our channel of course to our new boot sequence channel for up-to-date news on latest tech news and all that kind of stuff I'm Eber with Hardware Canucks thank you so much for watching and we'll see you in the next one",

    "transcript": "- Hey guys, this is the eight trillion dollar company. So, when you think of a trillion dollar business today, you probably think of Apple or Amazon, but compared to another company, Jeff Bezos and Tim Cook are broke. The Dutch East India Company, also known as the VOC, which stood for, you're really gonna make me say this? The [mispernounced] Vereeniging Oostindische Compagnie , the company's name in Dutch, I might have never butchered anything worse in my life. Now, they were formed back in 1602 as a cargo company to trade between Eastern Asia, India as well as South Africa. You knew I was not gonna be able to say that. - [Matt] Correct, I don't know how to say it either. That's why I didn't put it on there phonetically. - At the time, Portugal had the largest trade network in the world, however, when Spain went to war with Portugal both countries trade fell off significantly and those crafty Dutch saw an opportunity to capitalize. The East Indies companies were also happy to oblige, since it meant increased profits for their own governments, so they granted the Dutch a 20 year monopoly on their trade routes. Now, prior to the VOC, massive companies like this just didn't exist. I mean, sure, a company might own a couple ships, but nothing on this scale. Traditionally, every time a company wanted to trade, everything was on a case by case basis. A crew would be hired, a boat was chartered, and after the voyage everyone went their own separate ways. That is, until the VOC. Now, what made it different is that they purchased their own fleet of ships, they signed captains to long term contracts, and they established a network of merchants along their routes. Now, this meant that they were able to, not only conduct trade routes more frequently, but also more profitably since all aspects of the business were conducted in house. The only problem was that running a company like this costs money, a lot of money. If only there was a trend that like, all of our episodes take a nefarious turn because of the money aspect of things. The way things worked before the VOC, was that a wealthy individual or local business could buy a stake in a trade route, which would then help to fund the actual trip. I mean, they needed money to, say, find the boat and hire the crew. And when that trade route was completed, that person would then receive a percentage of the profits assuming that it didn't sink. In order to fund their rapid expansion plans, the VOC allowed anyone and everyone to purchase stocks. Now, fun fact, this actually made it the very first publicly traded company all the way back in the 1600's. Seeing the massive potential of this business model, Queen Elizabeth, who has been around for a long time, struck up a deal with the Dutch government which resulted in a subsidiary, the British East India Company. After that, the VOC had the means to destroy any competition and that is exactly what they did. Controlling almost all international trade from every continent. And when I say all trade, I mean it. These guys controlled shipping anything. At their peak, the East India Company had hundreds of ships and employed an estimated 70,000 workers all around the globe. They were worth the modern day equivalent of eight trillion dollars. Now, for context, that is more than the value of Apple, Amazon, and Google combined and then double that and then just throw in Microsoft for good measure. - [Matt] That's still only like, seven trillion. - At this point, the VOC was no longer just a company. Instead, they were operating like their own mini nation, complete with a governing body, a very very well equipped militia, and even their own money. Unsurprisingly, this made a lot of enemies. They were known for torturing merchants who had double crossed them, employing spies to blackmail politicians, and there are even rumors of them sending their army disguised as pirates to destroy any competitor. Now, it is hard to just sort of wrap your head around how massive this company is. I mean, sure, you can think about like eight trillion dollars, but imagine if Amazon not only controlled all the, sort of, the shipping and all of the purchasing in the world, but could straight up say, hey you know what? We're not happy with your company or your country, so we're going to stop sending food there, or we're going to stop letting people travel back and forth. I mean, this is completely unprecedented in pretty much any other aspect of history. The Dutch East India Company reigned for almost 200 years. At the turn of the 1800's, however, they had finally grown too large. Their debts had piled up, and the Dutch government, who had been backing them for all these years, could not afford to continue supporting the company. The VOC went bankrupt and were force to completely dissolve. A fitting end for what, in all likelihood, would be the largest and most powerful company to ever exist. If you enjoyed, go check out our episode on how a slightly smaller company ruled America for 100 years, and don't forget to smash that subscribe button and ring the notification bell, or Matt will be overthrown as the lord of This Is. - [Matt] Wait, what? - I mean, obviously everyone knows you rule with an iron fist. - [Matt] Haha!",

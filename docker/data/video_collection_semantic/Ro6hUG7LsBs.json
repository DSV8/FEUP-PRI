    "description": "The Axon M was released last year, but was pretty low key due to the exclusivity with AT&T.  But Now ZTE's dual screened smartphone has found its way to my desk, and its time for a durability test. The dual screen concept is actually pretty interesting on a smartphone. I have always used dual screens on my computer setup, so why not include a second smartphone display!?  What do you think? Would you ever buy a dual screen smartphone? What would you change to make it more practical?

    "transcript": "Today we'll be durability testing the W Noxv... ....or is it the Axon M? With so many phones these days I'm starting to get confused. This is the most recent dual screen Android phone released from ZTE, which unfortunately is an exclusive to the AT&T network. So not many people will get the chance to check this out. Today we'll be reviewing the Axon M dual screen smartphone together...my way. Let's get started. [Intro] The Axon M folds open like a book, revealing two 5.2 inch displays. It can mirror, extend, or just rock that dual display showing split screen apps on either side. Right now I have the camera and the calendar open at the same time. I'll fold it shut to turn off the back screen and go back to normal mode. You can also try an extended display. [Video playing on phone] Inside the box Apple was nice enough to include some headphones. Whatever movie you are watching jumps across the divide and shows one half of the flick on either side of the screen. This is great for people who think center pixels are overrated. Those center bezels take out a decent sized chunk of the movie real estate. Flipping the phone sideways though will allow you to get the full screen effect while being able to read and participate in the comments at the same time. That part is pretty cool. Let's start the scratch test resistance of both screens. I have a set of Mohs picks that tell me what the screen is made from. Plastic scratches at a level 3, tempered glass at a 6, and diamonds would be a level 10. You might be thinking that this is the first dual screen Android phone, but actually back in 2011, Kyocera released it's Echo with dual 3.5 inch displays. It's cool to see a more modern version now in the Axon lineup. Both screens have scratched at a level 6, with a deeper groove at a level 7, which makes sense for this Gorilla Glass 5 on both sides. So I make my way up to the top of the phone and we find a dual tone flash that's made from plastic, and one camera lens that's embedded underneath the Gorilla Glass 5. It's a 20 megapixel camera and it's the only one that exists on this phone. But with a screen on both sides, it's easy to switch back and forth. The earpiece is flush with the front glass and also made from plastic. Up here at the top of the phone we have some metal and a headphone jack. This Android phone made room for 2 huge screens and a jack. Some companies can't even fit a jack in a phone with one screen. There's always room for jack. The sides of the phone are full of our favorite sound. A solid metal frame, along with a metal camera button, fingerprint scanner, metal volume rocker, and a metal SIM and expandable memory SD card tray. It really does make you wonder what cool things Apple could do with their money if they ever decided to innovate. Checking to see if the scratched fingerprint scanner still works. I registered my finger and tried it out a few times. It went well and still functioned, but normally I scratch things a little bit more. The second time around the fingerprint scanner only functioned about half the time, but it would seriously be hard to cause this level of damage on accident. At the bottom of the phone we have dual speaker slots...another thing the iPhones doesn't have...and a USB-C port all surrounded by that metal frame. Now, most of the Axon M is metal, but the surround of the secondary screen is plastic. I'll dig more into this in a second, but first, check out the canvas size on the back of the W Noxv. So there was a survey done of 16,000 people that found 72% of those people check their smartphones at least once an hour. It's impressive how addicting smartphones can be. A separate survey found 75% of people admitted texting and driving. Interesting to see how closely those numbers match up. And that's why I drew this hourglass. Maybe we don't always need to check our phones every hour. I mean, you already know none of DM's you just slid into are going to get a response, so you might as well just wait. Oh, and the battery door panel is metal, and the rest of the back surface is plastic. This little extrusion here fits comfortably into its counterpart on the other side of the phone, keeping both sides extremely solid. There's no wiggling around when the phone is shut. But as you know, we'll be testing this more in a second. It's time for the burn test. This phone has dual 5.2 inch IPS LCDs and it lasted about 8 seconds before the pixels turned black. They did recover completely after the heat was removed, which is always kind of fun to watch. Just remember, don't do this to your own phone. Some screens don't recover. And now the bend test. The bend test shows a lot about what kind of abuse the phones can handle during it's lifespan. In an ideal world, phones would never get damages, but accidents happen. Luckily both halves of this phone are totally solid. No flexing or shifting between the layers. So even sitting on this phone in your back pocket, the hinge will remain intact with the way those grooves are situated in the back panel of the phone supported by that super long full length hinge. Everything is solid, at least while the phone is closed. Now if I were to open the phone up and intentionally snap it at the weakest point, then yes, it would be catastrophic. But in the normal used closed position, this phone is a winner when it comes to build quality. I think we'll gain more from a functioning tear down video then we would by taking a cheap shot at that open hinge. Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already, and we'll review this tech from the inside. Would you ever buy a dual screen phone? What would you want to change to make it more useful? Thanks a ton for watching, and I'll see you around.",

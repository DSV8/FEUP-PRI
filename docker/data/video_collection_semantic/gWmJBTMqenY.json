    "transcript": "- All right, iMac G3 Short Circuit, we're finally (beep) doing it. Screw you Linus. This thing's interesting. Right, I have to start this off here with a sad story of neglect. (beep) (exclaims) The last time this showed up in a video, Linus kicked it off of a desk. It was an absolute atrocity. So, you know, I absolutely love this thing. It was my first real computer. So we're gonna go ahead and you know, clean her up. Have a nice little time and have a bit of nostalgia as well. But before we get into that, PIA sponsored this video. Thank you guys. PIA is a VPN that encrypts all of your traffic and uses a safe protected IP. You can connect up to five devices, Mac, Windows, Android, IOS, and Linux. Probably not something quite this old, and there's an internet kill switch, which keeps you in control of your connection. Try it risk free with a 30 day money back guarantee at the link below. If, for whatever reason, you don't know, this is the iMac G3. It's maybe one of the most iconic computer designs ever, and it's what gave Johnny Ive, the dude who designed this, his job title as the chief design officer at Apple. It's maybe one of the most beautiful computers ever made, like just look at that. I have no clue who owned this. Apparently, it's been with the company for three office moves. Just before we start it up here, we've got the IO. For the time on a PC, this was considered pretty bad. People got really angry about the fact it only had a CD drive right here. Floppy disks were still quite popular in like 1999. So it was pretty radical that they only included a CD drive here. We've also got two FireWires. I believe that is 56K modem and ethernet. We also have only two USB ports. That's a bold decision. So apparently, the original version, you know, the one that had the flippy doodle that comes out, and then there's a CD drive, Steve Jobs apparently hated that. It was not supposed to be, it was supposed to be this one right here, but they just couldn't get it like totally done in time. So I guess, do we just see if it works? Let's just get right into it. I'm so excited for the dong. (claps) Yeah, that came out weird. (computer dongs) Yeah (laughs). We are in Mac OS 10, which is a bit unfortunate, because this right here is kind of the last generation of powerPC Macs that's not X86. And you know, these powerPCs CPUs, it's got a single core, this one right here is the fast one, which goes at 400 MHz. But in Mac OS 10, she runs like hot garbage, so originally this right here came with, I think it will be 9.2, and it ran really fast, and there were quite a few applications, and then because the powerPC CPUs were a bit too power hungry, a bit too hot, Apple switched over to Intel, and they kind of just dropped support for these, like one or two years after they started existing. So we have a 13.8 inch display here. And it is a 1024x768 display at 75 Hz. I think everyone that actually used this would go with the 800x600 resolution, and you get 95 Hz, just looked so smooth. It's the kinda thing where like, back in the day, I didn't even know that I preferred high refresh rate monitors. But it still is what I went for. Anyway, let's go in here, what applications do we have? iMovie! (exclaims) It's booting into Mac OS 9.2 inside of 10, so that we can open iMovie, and I'd give it a 50% chance of working. Oh, yep. (slaps hands down) This application or control panel is not supported. I have no clue what this computer is, or where it came from. Ope that's, that's legitimately someone's tax info. Let's just close that there (laughs). Everybody, wipe your PCs before you send them to places. I guess that we'll have to not show people the audio, because we definitely don't have any of this. Oh, iTunes is opening. It was still green back then, that's fun. We're going to have to cut the audio soon here, but so it's pretty funny, I would say that those speakers are very comparable to that on the MacBook Air that we recently reviewed. And were like, \"Oh my (mumbles), these are great. \"How did they do it?\" Well, back in the day, you just made them frickin' huge, and then you had great sound, no problem. They aren't particularly loud, like I remember that like you can't fill a livingroom with these speakers. But if it's just you sitting in front of it? It's a pretty great time. Lots of highs, fair bit of bass. I'm pretty impressed, especially given how old this poor thing is. Ah, I actually do remember this game. It kinda sucks. It's Andy's mom's favorite game. I'm sorry. There were actually like a number of pretty good games, Marathon being the most notable. That was like, what Bungee did before Halo. Halo was actually supposed to be a Mac exclusive, and then Microsoft just came in, and was like, \"Yeah (mumbles), we want that.\" What a different world that would've been. Even though that game right there wasn't particularly demanding, this did have pretty good graphics for the time. So this had the ATI Rage 128 which, as far as raw performance goes, was really good. It was pretty comparable to the 3Dfx Voodoo, although according to what I've seen online, the driver support was just hot garbage, so it never really got the love that it probably deserved. I guess it's kind of what happens still with like AMB Cards. Let's just get into it. As we flipped it around here, and now we have access to just this little slot right here, I think is the only part of the computer that Apple wanted you to actually, you know, dig into. So we have a look at the RAM now. Are you guys able to see that at all? Oh, there's no light in there. There we go. Can you see that, David? Yeah, so we got the RAM right in here. And this is about all Evie expected to be able to upgrade. So this one's 512 megabytes. And this one right here is 256. So that is definitely upgraded. I think this came with up to 64 megabytes of RAM back in the day, so having, what? Over 700 megabytes of RAM would've been pretty insane. It's like, that would be like, I don't know, finding a new iMac with 2 terabytes of RAM in it. Like, you can, but no one really is going to until much later. Yeah, so if you want to splay out, I don't think I've ever seen like a real person use an extra monitor with these. But in theory, you can. It's kind of hidden, though. Oh wow, you don't see screws like that in computers anymore. Is that self tapping? I think so, that's pretty gross. I just realized that I forgot my Sublime CD in there. I don't know if I'm ever getting it back (laughs). Oh cheese. It didn't break, we did it! So it looks like around all of the computer components here, we have a Faraday cage. I guess that that's to prevent like, too much noise from happening from like the, you know, the big CRT that's up here on the top. So I guess that kind of explains why more people didn't bother making all-in-ones back in the day. Then again, also it was just hard to make all-in-ones. Not many people do it these days either. All right, Faraday cage gone. Wow, those are definitely exposed capacitors. That's cool. So if we look here, any of those, you touch them, and you're going to be having a really bad time. So now we can see the logic board, not to be confused with the motherboard. It's actually the same thing, but Apple just calls them logic boards for whatever reason. Well guys, I really hope that you like this video, cause there's something about just really old things. And when you take them apart, you don't really know what you're going to find inside. I would like to do more of this. And I imagine Anthony also wants to do a lot more of this. Hit us up in the comments down below, and I don't know, basically tell Linus that you want more retro stuff, cause I definitely do. Look at the size of this battery, is that the CMOS? That's hilarious. This right here is the connector for the CD drive and also the hard drive. You guys may think it looks familiar to an IDE, but it's actually a scuzzy, which is SCSI. I don't actually really know the difference between the two, besides scuzzy is a fun name to say. I really wanted to do a sleeper in this, but it turns out that getting a display that fits, doesn't really exist. So if anyone can find a display to go in this, please let me know. I will use it in an instant. This right here is just the absolute weapon of a CPU that you get in here. So, 400 MHz, single core. Not even X86, but it's, yeah, there's not a whole lot of redeeming qualities of it, but it was pretty cool at the time. What did I have for a heat sink here? I guess someone yell at me in the comments if I'm wrong. But as far as I can tell, all that you get for heat sinking in this, is this little block of aluminum that's jammed up against the processor. And then it goes into this admittedly fairly large chunk of aluminum here, that is used to, you know, stop too much interference coming in from the CRT on top. How? No wonder Apple switched to Intel, they're just like, \"Oh, powerPC is way too hot.\" Meanwhile, this is what you've got for a cooler on it, good (mumbles). This is absolutely going to suck to put back together. I'd be half-tempted to not, except that my Sublime CD is still in the front here, and with these right here, you know how like on a normal CD player you'd be able to take, like, the pen and jam it in, and get your CD out, if there's no power? No such luck on these, so... Here is a CRT. We're not going any further. Because even though there should be a drain resistor in here that, you know, takes away any of the high voltage that exists in here, it's what? 20 years old? I don't trust it. And, you know, there's a big ol' 400 volt capacitor right there, bunch of other stuff, basically have an electron gun that's very high voltage, and if I touch any of this, I die. Not quite the ending that I'd hoped for this iMac G3. It's an absolutely beautiful machine, and I hope that you guys liked this video here. Hit like, get subscribed, and I need to put this back together, so I can get my Sublime CD back.",

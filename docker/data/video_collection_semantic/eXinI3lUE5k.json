    "transcript": "This is a video that I needed to make, alright? And you probably need to hear it as well The product itself Now I know that angle you are coming from You are going through emotions in your mind right now You are thinking about your response But I want to talk to you before you make that comment down below This might not be what you think it is That's the true This thing showed up here At first I was like, \"What kind of a troll is this?\" These people high and mighty what do you think... Who do they think they are! Then I looked into it a little bit closer This thing right here is called the NoPhone Well in fact, there are a few different versions of it The NoPhone original, the NoPhone Air and the NoPhone selfie With the Air, you can pretty much tell... You can tell what's going on, there is no phone in there! Now the NoPhone original and selfie are not that much different, each one is a little bit of a twist But there is no phone here! You probably have a phone You might be watching this video on a phone If that's the case, keep watching But this thing here it represents a concept, it represents a thought Some people, might be a little bit too attached These devices You've been at a dinner, you've been at some sort of gathering And you see it. Trapped People are trapped, they are locked, in a hypnotic state into this device People even.... They use it as a crutch They got nothing to say. So what do they do? They dive over here. Because there is going to be too much effort to actually tribute The people that depend on you to have something to say Sorry what did you... Did you ask me something? I wouldn't know, because I was halfway deep over here in some meaningless thing! These guys are trying to make a statement Is this a product that you are going to buy? No, probably not But I am here, on Unbox Therapy, with the opportunity to at least tell you that it exists, and to explain the concept This product is for people who are too addicted to their phones Now you might think that discipline plays a role here, but I don't know I have seen people from every spectrum of the universe With all the discipline in the world still locked into that thing hypnotically I'm telling you there is some magic in play There's that little dopamine hit Oh, you got a heart? That's cute. You got a like? Was that a thumb? That's nice We are not immune to it. That is stimuli That's that nicotine! Cause you don't have a needle in the arm doesn't mean its not happening This is the NoPhone. Its a fake phone for people who are addicted to real phones The NoPhone Air: Invisble phone for people who use their phone too much Zero megapixel pictures, zero gigabyte of storage, no headphone jack That's a shot at Apple right there And no WiFi And then the NoPhone selfie, for people who are addicting to looking at themselves The most famous people in world are all this, half the time Looking at themselves, snapping a photo Staring into the abyss, looking for some level of meaning Following that social media going \"man it will be nice to be like that\" And I am just giving it to you guys straight how I see it I am immersed in this world. I am immune to it. One of the creepiest thing you will ever experience in your life, and I know, from experience You will see a person attempting to craft the perfect selfie But you see it as an outsider, you take a step back And you see them looking, you see the look on their face They attempt to perk up, pop their lips out, and do whatever it is the thing they do It is an awkward feeling you have inside of like Knowing that the emotion that, that person is attempting to portray through that lens is not a real one, its an act Half the stuff people are putting out there, is an act. Its an act! There is a social reward, potentially associated with it You take, you snap that selfie while you're in Spain or wherever it is that you're are visiting And then all of a sudden, social reward come creeping in All those people in your social media, they start saying: \"boom, boom, boom!\" And you start going \"BOOM!\" That's a little win for you. Or was it though? Because how did you actually feel eventually? Cause you then had to go back, you had to go back to do that all over again And maybe through that process, you forgot what the real world version of that might have been Maybe you had a conversation with a stranger, or you shook somebody's hand, I don't really know. Now right now you guys think that it sounds like I am lamenting on some reality that doesn't exist anymore, that's probably true Not saying anybody is wrong for doing it, I am just identifying the progress The unavoidable progress This thing here aims to, I don't know, maybe claw back a little bit of it \"With a thin, light and invisible design, the NoPhone Air feels like nothing in your hand because it is nothing in your hand\" \"Put down your smartphone and pick up the NoPhone Air. Its like nothing you've ever seen\" It might be the perfect gift for somebody who is obsessed And I can't tell you the number of time that I am locked in I was like, the Instagram Discovery page and I was like, do I even... Is this stuff I even want? I am not saying that there is no such thing as, decent time spent on it There's plenty of times where I watched someone, I'm like you know, that was valuable to me, or meaningful to me There's also plain at hindsight, that I'm locked in with the hypnotic beam hitting these retinas the NoPhone acts as a surrogate to any smart mobile device enabling you to always have a rectangle of smooth cool plastic to clutch without foregoing any potential engagement with your direct environment. That's kind of deep. look at this thing a slab of plastic possibly the most pointless product of all time if it's if it's so it's like a 3D printed, there you go Jack, NoPhone inside. Its probably perfect for Jack! This will be an interesting experiment though you stick this thing in your pocket I don't know for a week or something when do you stop reaching for it? when do you stop feeling those phantom vibrations associated with your notifications? never again experience the unsettling feeling of flesh on flesh when closing your hands that these maybe it's a gag gift maybe it's pointless or maybe it's you running off on a tangent like I am right now this time we can go deep on you looking at yourself that is bizarre there's a mirror on the front that's you that's you and that's me and that you we're about to take a step deeper into the evaluation here with this guy who exactly are you? The presentation? The person? that that people know on a personal level or are you a fabrication of yourself i know you guys didn't sign up for this today you clicked on the video thinking you're about to see some new gadget and I went deep on you but the truth is every so often you got to evaluate you got to see where you're at and how you got there discipline is still a thing you can do something about this you can pick and choose and do a better job of curating what you're exposed to the stimuli is everywhere you know this i don't need to tell you your eyeballs are included your smartphone is included you have this video as an opportunity to take a step back just examine how it's influencing you at least that's what i did this is a stupid product but that's what makes it interesting every so often give yourself a NoPhone throw a football or something kids or don't. Play video games till your eyes bleed. It's your life or is it?",

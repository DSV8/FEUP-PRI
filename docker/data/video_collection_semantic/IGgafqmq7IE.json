    "transcript": "- Oh, it's not a fire hazard. - No, this is a fire hazard. - That, that... - Actually, this is really bad too. It's a solid six outta ten fire hazard. In this box, is a power supply that can supposedly provide 3,450 watts of power! How did they do that you ask? Evidently, by bolting two power supplies together! How on earth are we gonna test a 3,450 watt power supply? Oh, don't worry. We've got some ideas. And it involves putting not one, not two, not three, not four, not five, but six RTX 3080s on the line! So I really, really hope this thing doesn't blow up, like this segue to our sponsor! KiwiCo! KiwiCo sends out crates that contain hands-on projects for kids and teens to help develop creative confidence and problem solving skills. There's something for all ages and all interests, so learn more at the end of this video or at the link down below. (upbeat music) First of all, strictly speaking, this is not two power supplies bolted together, because it only has one input, which is actually kind of terrifying. - (laughing) There's a lot terrifying about this. - How could you possibly expect to get 30, 4... 50 watts out of one C13 power connector? - Yeah, that's a good question. - How much did I pay for this thing? - $300 Canadian. Do you wanna know something that's kind of fun? - I mean, other than the like... sort of Bitcoin logo rip off. - Yeah. Do you wanna know the number one thing that was bought with this at the same time? - It's gotta be a mining rack. - No, guess again. - Waifu pillow. - Oh, fire extinguisher. - This hat. - (laughing) I knew it! - Okay, I guess I have to wear it for the rest of the video then, right? Obviously. - Yeah. - Wow. It's definitely got ample cooling on this bad boy. You've got dual 80 millimeter fans in the front, dual 140 millimeter fans on the top, and actually what looks like a pretty decent amount of heat sink in here. It's almost like the platform was designed for a considerable amount of power, but then they just didn't put a lot of it in here. - Yeah, do you wanna open her up? - Wait, it is two power supplies. I thought the PCB went all the way acro- what the (bleep)! I always get concerned when companies make up their own certifications, 90 plus platinum. Not a thing! And if it was, it would probably be platinum colored, not gold, which makes me wonder how much of anything else on here is actually real. It supports 180 to 200 volt AC input, which makes sense. There's no way you'd be... I mean, you'd blow the circuit before you manage to pull 3,000 watts out of a 120 volt circuit. Is it time to open it? - Yeah! - All right, let's do it. Where's my LTT store screwdriver? If you're not already, make sure you sign up for the wait list, because one day, this fine man will deliver a finished screwdriver. Oh, are you opening up a real power supply? - Yeah, so- - Love it. - This is a 1600i. You would kind of want two of these to get over 3,000 watts. - Yeah. Kyle's our lead creator warehouse engineering. He apparently spent the last few weekends learning about power supplies after being put on the spot last time we opened up his sketchy power supply. So hopefully he's able to provide us a little bit more insight this time around. We'll see how good his studying skills are. So Kyle you've already opened this, right? - Yes. Be careful. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. This is the part of the video where we say, \"Don't do this.\" We do not recommend opening up any kind of AC to DC power supply. There are capacitors in here that will store enough power to throw you back across the room. Maybe not quite that much, CRT TVs, yes. These maybe not quite so much, but you could die. What it looks like to me is we have a single power input that has been simply pigtailed out to two discrete power supplies. But, what I think has happened here is the second power supply only contains the bare minimum required to produce 12 volt. Whereas, the primary one has all of the other rails that would be required to run a PC, so your 3.3 volt, your five volt. And that's what all of this componentry that's missing in here is doing over here. What I have no means to evaluate is whether this is a quality 12 volt power supply now, or a pretty junk one. I would hazard a guess that at $150 each, they're not really anything special. Kyle, tell me more. - I would like you to draw your attention to the power switch that's on there and tell me how you think that works. - Good, God. (laughing) - What does the green on a 24 pin mean? - Well, the green on a 24 pin is your power on. Wait, it just goes straight to the power switch. That's not normal. - (laughing) Yeah. What do you thinks on the other side of the switch? If you were to take a guess, what would be on the other side of the switch? - Well, a switch is normally in a closed position to allow current to flow. - Yes. - And in an open position does not allow current to flow. - So what would you expect to go to one side of the switch? - A ground. - And then on the other side, you'd go the li... the other lively to the board, right? - Wait, holy (bleep)! - (laughing) You got it now. - This switch doesn't actually turn off the pow- - Yeah! - The power supply. - You got it! - This switch turns on the power! That is NOT how you are supposed to do that! Just to validate that, let's have a look at our AX1600. This should kind of be all you need to know though, because this is what a quality 1600 watt power supply looks like next to a random banggood.com 3400 watt power supply. Look at the size of this primary side cab. Holy bananas! We've got our live. We've got our neutral. We've got what seems to be a fuse. - Okay. So that's basically what you call an X class capacitor. It goes across live and neutral, and live and common. - Mhm. - And then right next to it are two Y class capacitors that go from your line to chassis or earth ground. It's for EMI and without going to turbo node into it, EMI is bad, and those help in some way. They transform a very ugly voltage into a nice cleanish sign wave, depending on how many you have and how good quality they are. - Oh, we're missing... We're missing one of these boys, who was supposed to be on the board here. - Well, and you just missed the other thing that's missing. (laughing) - Oh wait, what is the... what's supposed to be here? Wait, is this just bridged? What's supposed to be there? - Something called a common mode choke. - Wait, they just... they just soldered wires across it. - Yes and that's not a common mode choke, I can guarantee that. From there, we go into a standard full bridge rectifier. Shout out to ElectroBOOM. Then, we go into just a regular smoothing capacitor and then this is pretty interesting, it's an NTC, but it doesn't do anything with temperature. It's actually a... in rush, current limiter. So it's when you plug this in, you don't trip your breaker by charging these caps. This along with a power mosfet diode and some control circuitry that exists is your active power factor correction. - Okay. - So it... it has it, whether it works remains to be seen. We can't do anything right now until we take this board and resolder to this resistor over here. - Wait, what? Why? - Because it's not connected! - Oh my God, it's not soldered. - Yeah. - Well, how many other things are not soldered? - I... I do not know. That's the only one I saw. Oh my word! - The- - Yeah, okay. So Will... Will be careful. So the ground wire of the low side here is connected to this board as well. And there's a very sketchy heat pad on the bottom that I took off to see what it was and now it won't go back on. - Can you poke... can you poke it a little for me? - No! Well, you won't be able to find it, cause it's got solder in it. You have to- - It doesn't have solder in it though, does it? - It does! It does! It's just... it doesn't have the lead in it. - Oh, okay. Oh my God, I don't think either of them are through the board. - No, I thought the other one was. - Nope, it's just- - Well, through the board doesn't matter, as long as it's making connection to the angular ring, that's good enough. Yeah, okay. No, well there's... there's loose and there's like loose with three L's. - They're both loose loose. - Okay. - Look! Neither of 'em are attached at all. - Oh, you broke it man! - I didn't break anything. - It wasn't broken! - I broke nothing! It was broken. - Don't! (sighs) - I think we should teamwork this. It's really easy to find which holes we're targeting, because they are... This one and this one, where there are no legs coming through, compared to this one and this one, which are the other sides. And you can clearly see the legs coming through the bottom. - This one... and this one. - This one first? Should we do this one first? - So these two. Yeah, we can do the top one first, one sec. - Are you pushing it in the hole? - I'm trying. - How... How's your aim? - I know it! - I'm okay! I mean, I'm wrong. Oh, freak. I don't know if I trust my hand so close to Linus and his soldering arm. - I'm fine. - Oh, oh, oh, oh! - Oh, I see it. - Yes! Yes! - I see it. You got it. - It's got red! Yes! - Okay, it's crowning. (laughing) - We good? - Yes. - Oh no, the resistor is the wrong way around. - Shut up. It is not. (laughing) - In order to know how much the power supply is drawing, normally you'd use something like this. Unfortunately, those only work for 110 volts. So I bought this thing right here. - Wait. You just put the cable through here and then you get a readout? - Sort of, yeah. - But wait, how do you get this around the cable? - Well, that's the sketchy thing that we have to do. - Oh my God! You're just trying to cut it. - Yeah. Viewers, I'm sorry that this is what we're doing, but there is a good reason. We're buying cheap crap like this, because we bought a very expensive tester that's gonna be arriving soon, but not super soon, because shortages. - So we don't wanna blow a bunch of money on something that we're just gonna replace like immediately. - Yeah. When's that arriving Kyle? - In the middle of the seventh month of the year. So they sent me the date and it was like 07 and I didn't convert it to names. - (laughing) - Two months! - Just... Just engineer things. - Two months. - I don't know if we should even show people this, but this is what we did. - For the record, don't do this. - Yeah, really though. A lot of the time we say, \"Don't do this.\" This is like for realsies, do not do this. This is 240 volt. Then- - Well- - We spliced in these leads, but which ones do they go in? - These two. - These two boys here? - Yeah. - Okay. - No, well what are you doing? - What? - (laughing) Okay, I'm gonna plug this guy in, just FYI. - You... you don't have the... the power cable that Linus is working on plugged in, right? - No. - And if he did have it plugged in, I would be totally safe. See that? Everything insulated. We grabbed an older X299 platform for this and Asus figured this was a cool way to do M.2's back then. - Yeah, I'm not saying that someone accidentally knocked it over and had to put it back in with pliers today, but don't... don't hit it again please. - What's broken, the border or the drive? - Nothing, I put it back in with pliers. - Okay! Here's your GPU power connectors. Oh no! Okay, this is scary. - Should we just test it like this? You know, nothing plugged in to make sure... to make sure this thing works. - Oh yeah. We should all probably get glasses too. - Yeah! Let, let... let's take a sketchy power supply, turn it on with no load. - 209 volts, so we're like right smack on the 208 volts we're supposed to have in here. You might say this puppy- - Don't... Don't touch it. Don't touch it. - You might say this puppy has a lot of energy. - (barking) - Yeah, just don't touch it. - Good luck everybody. I think the system's gonna... oh, interesting. It didn't fire up. - What? - What? - Okay, maybe just leave it in the on position? - Yeah, it's in the on position. - Okay. Well, lets- - Go ahead and bridge it. Wait. wait, what the (bleep). - I pressed the power button. - Oh, oh. (laughing) - Those 80 mills, those are goers. I wonder how much they're fighting with these 140s for... moving airflow around in here. It works! - Well course it does. - Well yeah. - What... what do you mean \"Of course it does\"? We had to solder our resistor back into it! Now, how much power can it provide? 7.2 watts, yes, does seem to be working. All right. - Yay! - Let's power this boy up! You ready? I can't... I don't know where the switch is. Here we go. Man, that's annoying and loud. - I am surprised that at idle it is doing like 200 watts. - It's a lot. - Why yes Kyle, we do still have the camino system. I'm assuming you agree that we should try to power it with this instead of the three 1,000 watt power supplies that are in there now. - (laughing) No. I had logistics take it out of here and hide it. I don't know where it is. (laughing) - I told you I wanted to try it! - I know! So I had logistics take it and hide it. I don't know where it is. - You dick! For sampling, I'm thinking render samples 10,000? Okay, let's hit it. Ayy, that's more like it! 400 Watts. 'Kay. - Yeah, maybe just don't hold that. You have one piece of electrical tape between you and 208 volts. - Something rattling in there. Let's add some more GPUs! - Yeah, only 3,000 more to go. - Let's get this power supply completely unplugged. Notice how the system is pow... oh wait, is it not powered down? What is it doing? Is it Windows updating? - Where's the graphics cards physically going? - I don't know. - Like over the ta... Oh my! - You're just putting them everywhere? - Well, they have to be within the reach of this, which is not that far, cause they cheaped out on the copper. (laughing) - Okay, so our primary goes here then? - Sure. Yeah, that's a good spot. - Uh... - Do you have some zip ties? - Alex wants to file down the backs of these slots here so that we can fit a 16X card in a 1X slot. Got a handful of these. Basically, you just power up this little board. There's your 16X slot. This USB cable just plugs into a little PCIe x1. I don't think these things will do more than Gen 2 speeds, but that doesn't matter for what we're doing. Why doesn't one of us do data and the other one do power here? - I'll- - Kyle, you can stand there and look... you can stand there and look imposing. - I'm so sorry everyone that sent these to us. Like I'm sure MSI thought that this would be in like, you know, the ultimate gaming PC instead of this. This is all of our 3080s in the office. - So if the power supply blew these up, we would have no more 3080s left. - What's the worst that could happen? - This power supply has a frickin' lot of eight pin PCIe connectors on it, so credit for that. I know I say... I've said this a lot lately, but I think this is the worst thing we've ever done. (laughing) That's the pattern. It's this Alex character. - Well, it's... you know, you have to have variety. A lot of people in the... what was it called? Desk Made of Radiators? They're like, \"I miss how janky your videos used to be.\" - Look Michael Bag, you don't have to one up your last feature every single time. - It's time, yep. - Shall we bet lunch on how much the power's gonna be? - Closest without going over? - Oh. (laughing) - Unplug! Unplug! - What's up? - We did not do eight pin power for this one. (laughing) - On a scale of one to ten, how much of a fire hazard? - It's... It's fine. - It's oh... it's not a fire hazard. - That- - No, this is a fire hazard. - That, that, yeah. - Yeah, this is bad. Actually, this is really bad too. Okay, I'd say it's a solid- - Yeah, yeah. - six outta ten fire hazard. - Okay, it's on. - Don't worry about fire. - Power it up. Let's go! There we go. Now all the fans are spinning. This is a thing. Motherboards flipping out about having too many PCIe devices and not being able to boot up. (sighs) Where's the camino? - No! - No! - What about we unplug the two that are in the one slots and see what happens. - Sure and then we'll go get the camino? - I don't know where the camino is. - Yes, you do. (laughing) - Mutiny! - What? (laughing) - I asked for the render server to be brought out here and instead I get this. - Yeah, it's every 3080 we have, plus one. - What do you mean plus one? - Well, we have seven now. - Oh. - I found another one. - Go. - Hit it! - Oh? - Okay what is- - 550 watts. - At idle? - It occurs to me we need to redo our guesses. We've got an additional card. - Oh yeah! Oh. Here we go. We're going into Windows, 918. - 900 watts just to fire up the desktop, what?! I mean, this is clearly a high octane desktop here. Holy crap! Wait, this is a threadripper pro board. - Yes! - Okay, hold on a second. Now, I was willing to risk a bunch of RTX 3080s, but do you have any idea how hard it is to get your hands on threadrippers these days? - Yes. - Also, what is this board worth? This has gotta be like a thousand dollar motherboard. - $1,400. - $1,400! - I think the motherboard is the least of your problems. - GPU zero, one, two, three, four, five, and six. They're all in here. Holy crap! This is an ox power connector. There's two more ox power connectors and then there's dual eight pins for the CP. This thing is ridiculous! - We have a total of 23 eight pin PCIe's running to stuff. What could go wrong Kyle? - In theory, it's isolated. So nothing should go wrong if the power supply dies. But if you... if the isolation's garbage, high voltage goes through and then, yeah. - Do the 400 volt caps just dump into this or? - Potentially. - To be clear, this can happen. What he is talking about is not purely hypothetical. This is the point where it maybe goes pop, pop. - The fans starting to spin. - Oh whoa, there we go! Whoo! We got anywhere from 230 to 300 watts per GPU. I was way under I think, what did I say? Damn, I need... oh 2419. - No, I need- 2422- - I need 50! - 2443! I think I went too high. - Yes! Yes, my boys! - I said 2501. I wanted us to... I wanted us to break. - 'Kay wait, can we appreciate how much heat is coming off this thing? - Can we appreciate that it's still running? - 2520. - Yes I win! - Ahh no! - Thank you Kyle! - Damn it. So does it work? I mean, we haven't made it to 3450 necessarily, but we sure as heck got to 2500. We also don't know, exactly how... what the efficiency of this is. So 2500 from the wall, sure, according to this thing. But it's clear that we need some more sophisticated equipment in order to really put this thing through its spaces. Now tell me, can our power supply tester do this kind of load? - Yes. - Really? So we got the good one? - I got 3500. So like, 50 watts more than what this can do is our limit. - Okay, we're throwing in the threadripper pro. - We also might just need more ram to like really- - Like how much do you have in there, 64? - 32. - Pfft. - We're not saying this thing is good or safe. - No. - We're just saying that didn't blow up. - We will tell you in two months. - Yeah. - Yeah. Maybe three. - And what we'll tell you now is about our sponsor! KiwiCo!

    "transcript": "What's up guys, Lew here back with another video. And Today I've got something new it just came out. I saw this floating around the web. And I was like - man I can see the utility in that. I can see a lot of people being interested in this thing right here. It's called iXpand. And it is a memory case for your iPhone. This is about expanding the storage of your iPhone, without needing any kind of external device. The storage is built into the case. Comes in a couple of different sizes. This is the biggest one, 128 gigabytes So I'm thinking, you can get the highest capacity iPhone, stick this baby on there and then... I mean I don't know. I don't know what you're storing But... I think it's a pretty cool concept Let's check out the back of the box. What do we got? Play videos from the case, it supports all the file formats, and it provides durable drop protection. Now there's an app that goes with it as well But... What does it look like? It also comes in a few different colors. This one, as you can see is... red, and like this kind of gray, crosshatch color thing going on. You charge up the case by connecting it to the wall via USB. There's also an adapter here. This is gonna plug into the bottom, so that you can then use whichever 3.5 millimeter headphones that you want. So you slide this guy in. Then this guy goes back on. Lets see here. There you go. So... It's kind of an interesting look there. Ports here for your speakers This kinda maneuvers the sound which normally fires out the bottom of the iPhone towards you. When you're holding it. Buttons... And this port here, that's the magical port. Simple stuff. Boo-yah. I was wondering what this is for? Do you see this here? So that's for an add on battery pack. There's like a - See this little clip here, and those contacts? You can get a battery pack that like clips in here. You've now added extra storage. But then on top of that you can add extra battery too. Ok so I've got the app installed now it's called iXpand case. So you can setup camera backup. And this will allow you to backup you're entire photo library, off of your the devices internal storage, to the actually storage case. It's separates your data into documents, music ,video, and pictures. Ah, very cool, the dashboard here shows the battery life of the phone - 39%. Battery pack not connected. Available storage on the phone - 72% versus the case 99% . And, what percentage is taken up by certain style or certain type of file. But what if I click, lets say on the images I can swipe through. This is natively on the case. These files are on the case. And from there I can save it. So I can save it directly to the phone storage if I want to. Or I can send it out to social media, message it, print it. On the video side, It's got a native video player right in it for popular file formats. Now, this is actually really interesting, because if you've got a bunch of file formats, that aren't native to the iPhone. Since this is coming off the case, and it's in its own app. Now it's a basic MP4. And, another number of popular formats will play right here. Look. I'm just... I'm playing natively. And music... Same deal, it's got a player built in. What happens if I connect the case to like a laptop? It says it is charging. But does it boot up? Do I get... Does it mount? It's right here - music, photos, video. It's way better than those like little dedicated devices, because then you've got something else to remember in your pocket. In this case it just... It becomes more native. Apple's charging you a lot of money to go with the bigger capacity phones. Then you've got the formatting. Then you've got the pre-installed stuff. You really end up with not that much storage left over. Now, you can use the same phone, but essentially end up with way more storage. Lets say you were using iCloud, or Drive, or whatever, to offload some of the stuff that wouldn't fit on a phone. Well... What about when you're in the airplane, without WiFi.",

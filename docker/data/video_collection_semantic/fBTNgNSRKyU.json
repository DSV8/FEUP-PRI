    "transcript": "- Yo guys Jonathan here. Welcome to the perfect MacBook Pro setup. This is the 5k ultrawide music edition. (upbeat music) (music continues) (music continues) I try my best to shake it You must be contagious Your love's like that Oh there's no masquerading It's not complicated Your love's like that Wrestling as I go Slipping down this slope I try my best to shake it You must be contagious So meet Jacob and Sita. Two of my favorite human beings but also two of my favorite artists. I've used countless tracks of theirs in my videos. You guys can too if you want to check them out on Musicbed which I will link to down below. But yeah, Jacob is a super gifted mixer, producer and Sita is this crazy talented song writer with an amazing voice. So the heart of the setup really comes down to two main elements. One, a 15 inch MacBook Pro. This is the Vega update that happened late last year. Then, of course we have this giant but also beautiful 34 inch UltraWide 5k monitor from LG, which is bananas. So a huge reason I chose and wanted to highlight a MacBook Pro for this setup is the flexibility that it gives you. Not only can you create in a desktop-like environment but essentially anywhere, which is huge for Jacob and his creative process. - A lot of times when I'm mixing or I'm producing a beat I like to go to many different places. I feel like if I stay in one place all the time I start to not know what I'm hearing because I'm just seeing one thing over and over again. So I like to take my laptop, go upstairs and then go from there I'll go outside or go to a coffee shop or just go anywhere, because I can take it anywhere I want to go. - So yeah, its perfect for the road or on the couch but I also wanted to compliment that with the 5k UltraWide so you get the best of both worlds and that big, immersive desktop experience. This is packing a ridiculous resolution of 5120 by 2160 and especially for music production when you have plugins and multiple windows, that extra screen real estate is essential. - It's been great, when you get the wide monitor you're just looking really far like \"Oh I didn't know I had those muscles in my neck.\" (laughs) It's beautiful, I love all the hub. Like the hub on the back, you can just put everything in there, you can hide your wires. God knows my desk just looks so terrible most of the time but this makes it very easy and seamless. - [Jonathan] Rounding out the setup, I added a wireless keyboard and mouse from Logitech. This is my favorite pair. And of course, gotta add a splash of Phillips Hue to really bring some cool vibes to the entire setup. Now, in order to get music into the MacBook you need an interface and Jacobs weapon of choice for this setup is the Apogee Duet. Which is really awesome, especially for those looking to step up their quality but don't really necessarily want to break the bank. - I just love how portable it is, it doesn't require a power supply, it sounds amazing. I've had the Symphony, I've used the Symphony for a long time and I think its comparable. It's amazing how much they packed into such a small device. - [Jonathan] That is then connected to these monster audio monitors the Focal Twin6 Be's which oh my goodness, these things sound amazing. - I got these because Drake mixes all of his records on them and helps me (laughs loudly) sound as good as drake. No, I actually did consider that when buying these monitors but they're just very accurate, they give you a very balanced mix coming out of the monitors so you know exactly what you're hearing. You don't want the monitors to be too close to you and also not too close to the wall. So you want them to be equidistant from the wall and also equidistant from your two ears. And the two tweeters which are the little things at the top. They should be hitting your ears like this, when you're really trying to mix things right. And of course, the most important thing aside from monitors is having a treated room. So you want bass traps in the corners and the thing I didn't do until I moved to Nashville was I have the cloud straight up above my head and that's really important because you don't want the bass to be bouncing off right on top of your head and coming down and hyping the bass so you don't mix it properly. Now, the secret sauce to Jacob and Sita's tracks besides a ton of talent, is the microphone preamp combos they use which consist of a FLEA C12. That is then paired with a D.W. Fearn preamp which adds a ton of warmth and it just sounds beautiful. - [Jacob] It basically emulates to the T what a brand new C12 Telefunken microphone would sound like from the 1960s but it's much more reliable. And with those old microphones they all sound different because there's a different wear and tear on the parts but this is a brand new, old microphone. And it just sounds incredible, the build quality is fantastic. FLEA microphones, hands down, I think they're the best microphone company, in my opinion. And then with that we use the D.W. Fearn Pre which is just butter. That with the mike and you just have a beautiful, clear three-dimensional 2B warm sound and it's not hyped and you can just go to town on your plugins and it just sounds amazing. People don't you know, don't you Know, don't you know You gotta move like me, move like me People don't you know - So yeah that is some really pro-level, amazing gear but what I love about Jacob is his open-mindedness to create essentially with whatever you have. Which is really encouraging for anyone looking to get started. - Yeah there's really no need for me to have any outboard gear whatsoever because there's a plugin for just about any piece of outboard gear that you can possibly imagine. With companies like Splice and Noise the possibilities are limitless. There are no boundaries for music, you can create any sound that you hear. And in the beginning, what I would hear in my head I couldn't actually translate into a beat but now I feel like I can actually do that freely. And because I had to wait for so long, I appreciate it so much more and I'm so happy for it. - [Jonathan] So huge thumbs up to Jacob and Sita for being awesome humans for letting me hang and putting that TLD splash on their setup. And also making awesome music which you guys can check out on Spotify and also even use in your own videos through Musicbed which I will link to down below. Hopefully you enjoyed the video. If you did and you want to see more like this make sure you guys smash that like button. This is Jonathan and I will catch you guys later.",

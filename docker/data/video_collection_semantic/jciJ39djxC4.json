    "transcript": "A few tech channels brought this to the forefront on Twitter and I can't resist it is so bad and full of such misinformation this may be how the verge builds a computer but it is not how you should build one this video is brought to you by ExpressVPN now what does a VPN and why should you care Virtual Private networking gives you the ability to securely browse the web by masking your IP and encrypting your data you can even run ExpressVPN from your iPhone or Android device to retain your security on-the-go a personal case where this came in handy Germany restrict certain Netflix shows and radio stations like Pandora which I didn't know beforehand so by simply clicking this button right here and tunneling through say Chicago I'm now accessing my content through Chicago instead of Germany so by by restrictions this is one use case but you get the idea anyone and everyone could benefit from a VPN go to ExpressVPN.com/science or click the link below and get three months free with a one-year subscription all right so I have the video up here now you see it's only got about 29,000 views it's not too much considering this channel it's 2.1 million subscribers but what attracts me more than anything is this like to dislike ratio here 839 up votes and then 1200 and roughly what sixteen or so down votes and that's not good that's enough that's an indication that the video is either extremely controversial or extremely inaccurate and you're gonna find out here it's the latter of the two it's kind of out of date and it's definitely not gonna hold up for Battlefield 5 so let's build a new one you can build a gaming desktop for around $1,000 but I want to go all out so I spent around 2,000 and if you need help choosing the right parts for your build there are sites like PC part picker com that helps you'll preset for which parts fit together which sort of part conflicts you might have and where to find deals on new parts okay so we're about two minutes in and I'm not seeing anything too controversial at this point I do think that they've made a few generalizations but nothing worth downloading the video for so let's keep going and see how cringe it actually gets here pay close attention to the brace that goes at the back of the computer you always have to make sure that you really hammer it in because there's no screw it girls accessories side of the case and clasp on to the frame it's pretty fast Ram it's two thousand six hundred and sixty six megahertz I believe so it's pretty fast and this motherboard sidewall your four standards that's not to with us now wick Lane you cues depends entirely on what other parts are gonna put in the system I'm just gonna pick the top one because the SSD is at the bottom and I don't want to cover it I just think it looks nice okay I was actually going to elaborate on why his statement regarding the PCIe slots is incorrect it's they're not all the same first off and there are bandwidth limits and not assuming that these cars can hit those limits but still they exist and that's why it doesn't matter to an extent which slot you plug those cards into but also I just noticed that he has both of his RAM modules to the far right side so he I guess is completely avoiding dual channel support because I mean this is just some some other words won't even boot like you can't even get to the BIOS when you do this sometimes because you're just you're just not supposed to you have slot a which is usually the second slot and the F slot B which is this far-right slot but he just completely ignored that I don't know if he did it on purpose maybe his cooler is too big we'll see what cooler uses it eventually but that's not correct that's actually super cringy I chose Corsairs 850 watt power supply because I need enough Headroom for ray tracing GPUs when they come out and I don't wanna have to upgrade it are you sure you can get biology that is take the brave a new card and make sure that you align it with these little insulating pads so the powers always isn't short-circuit and come into contact with the rest of the system I gotta replay this I gotta I gotta make sure I heard this correctly so all you have to do is take the break uh-huh and make sure that you align it with these little insulating pads so the power supply isn't short-circuit and come into contact with the rest of the system so that the power supply doesn't short-circuit and come into contact with the rest of system so you heard it from the verge first folks if you place your bear power supply shell against your chassis while your PC is on you will short-circuit something guaranteed that is the most idiotic thing I've ever heard from any channel claiming to know anything at all about pcs that is so this David is so dumb I got here one more time and make sure that you align it with these little insulating pads so the power supply isn't short-circuit and come into contact with the rest of the system slide it in nice and easy until you have a snug fit and then send it to the back and make sure it's right up against the frame now you just take your resource then okay so you're okay with the power supply touching the backside of the case but it can't touch the base of the case because that's where it's short-circuits I get it now so next step we're going to install the CPU core and this little bit on the top end of the case and we're just gonna have the hose hang out for the oil until we install the processor which is gonna come a little later next step is we're connecting the power supply to the motherboard with the 24 pin cable we're just matching that cable from the motherboard threading it through the back and attaching the 24 pin header to the power supply just economics 101 cable at a time as an EVP you for any specific ports that the case has for any lighting that the case has the CPU cooler okay he's gonna keep that all on classic port literally the entire time toss that out of here okay don't say that in school now we have an exposed CPU holder or rather slot on the motherboard you haven't even live in the socket levering applicator this is a special little part that not everyone may get but this McGowan is Isis definitely does have it's all CPU installation tool it makes it really use you just dropped the chip into the socket core i7 hexa core CPU oh yeah yeah and you've got Mauritian chip and he's got it grow and it supports overclocking and light it up with the triangles that you'll see on the bottom left corner there's a triangle that's more easier for us to apply it to the motherboard and then apply thermal paste and then you just drop the CPU into the sockets gonna carefully you literally just did it and make sure that everything lines up and we're gonna class you don't even have the bracket on there I think you realized halfway through filming that that was completely pointless every CPU hour actually comes with a base already neatly applied and a circle around it hmm but it's usually not enough it's good essentially PC building practice to have a little bit extra and layer it on top of the CPU you sandwich a third party paste onto the IHS with stuff that's already pre applied on to the Corsair cooler or whatever cooler is using that is so cringy I I just I've never seen that before I've never heard that ever recommended before it's probably not recommended for a good reason probably some weird air bubbles and stuff trapped between them I don't know but I know that that's not conventional and him recommending this on a site like the verge is just a little disappointing the final portion is to add this you know that application process my dad you spread that all over Disney you're gonna see that they're just just like let me get his finger out of this move your hand move your head look at that just it's like he drew a little maze with thermal paste all over the IHS and then he's gonna sandwich that on top of what he's already got pre applied on the water block dirt this is they're going to keep the cooler raised oh sure but it's also gonna be close enough to actually physically come in contact with Italy basically keep it cool this is pretty much what you would see me do on a gaming computer test stuff out and hopefully have really high frame rates like I am right now that gaming PC you've just built is way overkill for League of Legends in 1080p so for this to be your second game of choice to showcase for this gaming PC build you've done the entire build a disservice this is kind of a joke at this point I'm averaging 120 fps and then obviously I've actually locked the game yeah that framerate because I can get around 300 FPS playing League on maximum settings you don't say it's a little bit absurd and you don't really need that so because you can't see that on the monitor like that I've been a great experience I'm able to max out a lot of my favorite titles and I'll be able to play a lot of upcoming titles like battlefield 5 and cyber 2077 without worrying too much about the parts I have and of course now we also have a computer to test and benchmark games here with the verb ok I need to go back and look at this system because installation media on it and address resolution with ko screen didn't look that worried all this fun stuff is happening so we fully built the PC everything's put together yeah everything's put together Haley showed it one second probably because he's ashamed of it okay look he's got like his 24-pin running through here he's got I don't even know what that cable is I'm a maybe it's his EPS and did he run this eight pin through the front either this case has terrible cable management or he just doesn't know how to route cables he's got a mess of cables down there he didn't try to pull anything to the back and he just didn't care to make it look pretty and I'm sorry if you're on a channel like the verge with 2.1 million subs and you consider yourself you know a tech enthusiast channel then you're gonna want to keep things nice and tidy if possible this literally would have required like 20 seconds worth of cable management but he didn't even want to yank on cables because I don't know this is like a parody video that's what it feels like to me I mean look at this thing and yes that was his 8 pin cable so he has a penny PS running through the front he's got his 24 pin just kind of hanging he's got his VGA supplemental 8 pin looks like right there and he's it's just a mess it's an ugly looking bill definitely could have taken again a minute or so to clean this up and then it would have looked at least much more presentable than the way he has it here I don't know this just this just doesn't look good you know when the producer at the verge makes statements like this you shouldn't expect too much in the way of actual content in my opinion what a pretentious thing to say Phil we should all bow down to your technical superiority right because you guys type stuff and we film it honestly if you were willing to approve this video you have no place in the computer journalism space anyway no intended rhyme there I mean the guy on camera might be completely hands-off when it comes to production and that's fine I'm not faulting him specifically I just think that it definitely could have been conveyed much better than it was whoever wrote the script for sure needs a refresher a really quick one in regards to the PC building the reason why I think they disabled comments and likes and dislikes is because they saw how many people gave negative feedback in the comment sections including myself I literally pointed directly to the timestamp where he talked about you know short-circuiting your system when your power supply is not standing on rubber mats I guess this what he was trying to say no that makes sense that's all misleading and you're going to tell people how to build a PC the wrong way and that's why a video like this exists to shoot down any I don't know misconception out there that this video is accurate from the verge because it's not anyone who's built any PC at all ever knows that some of the things shown in this video or not true leave a comment down below this video thumbs up that was cool check out our sponsor again to ExpressVPN I appreciate their support in this one and we'll catch you in the next video this is science studio thanks for cringing with us.",

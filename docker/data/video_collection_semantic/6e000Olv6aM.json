    "transcript": "today I'm going to have a look at the gaming laptop recommended by our corporate overlords in fact I'm pretty sure Jeff Bezos is sitting on his yacht right now gaming on one of these bad boys although just because this is what the ZZ is packing does that mean you should get one too um probably not but before we find out today's video is sponsored by boot. deev an awesome way to learn the very valuable skill of backend giggity web development in both Python and go programming languages put. Dev put a lot of effort into gamifying the process of learning programming so that you can trick your gamer brain into thinking that you're just playing some programming themed RPG you're actually learning a super valuable skill and another thing that adds to the engagement factor of the courses is that there's a lot of practical learning involved so you're going to write a whole bunch of your own code which I don't know practical is the only way I learn anything so that sounds good to me so if boot dodev sounds good to you use the link down below to try it out for free or use the code David to get 25% off your first payment on a paid membership when I think of a gaming laptop I can't help but picture tacky hexagon vents behind which hides a dedicated graphics card with terrible thermals that sounds like a Harrier jet and most importantly it needs to actually be able to run games although I've clearly missed some memo because this Ace something or other is the Amazon's Choice gaming laptop and on First Impressions it doesn't have any of those things in fact it looks more like a Chromebook that's cosplaying as a dollar store MacBook now how the Amazon's Choice selection process works is kind of shrouded in mystery and Amazon's own explanation of how it works sounds borderline victim blamy to me but either way in today's video we're going to see how well Jeff's laptop holds up as the gaming laptop it apparently is now in First Impressions the laptop is kind of capable of opening one-handedly and the build quality this is kind of AliExpress laptop plastic but the lid is metal so that's nice it does kind of trick you briefly into thinking that it's a decently built laptop although the moment you get inside and see those fake speaker grills that illusion is Thoroughly shattered those speaker Grill stickers give me some real strong Deja Vu oh trackpad seems trackpad oh the keyboard's really not great but at least you get a numpad for your gaming sessions on the note of size this is a 15.6 in display that I hope very much is 1080P and high refresh rate but considering that the Z games with it it it probably is at least 1080p ooh the bottom is also metal that's very nice again if you just touch the outside of the laptop it does Trick you into thinking it's a pretty wellb built laptop when it comes to opening it up I think it's going to be pretty straightforward we've just got these screws and the bottom plate doesn't wrap around to the side iio so we're not going to break any IO when we when we take the back off there's also some ventilation and what I assume to be the actual speaker grills on this side in terms of IO on the left we've got a bunch of good stuff even a fullsize HDMI port you got to believe the ZZ is powering some external displays with this bad boy and then on the right aside from some more USB we've also got a Micro SD card slot which I don't know why manufacturers bother with this do people still use this size let me know in the comment section down below but with that let's see how easy it is to crack open the laptop and then we'll discuss our high tier gamer specs now aside from a definitely not a warranty void of removed sticker getting the back off was even easier than I thought it would be ah yeah should just be able to lift that off that is a very easy to get off top uh because it is metal and it doesn't have any of those dumb plastic clips that keep it in place and then under that metal plate I can see why Jeff uses one of these you can upgrade the RAM you can upgrade your storage you can replace your Wi-Fi card there's even a bit of heat sink going on although the one thing that you'll notice immediately is that there's just one location where the heat pipes are coming from and that's because this gaming laptop doesn't have a dead dedicated graphics card in it this is an AMD 5700 U which has an igpu in it so it should be able to do some gaming but we don't have a graphics card in here and this laptop costs quite a lot for a gaming laptop that doesn't have a graphics card in but before we check out the price let's fire it up when it comes to the VD situation it was all looking good yeah look at that it's clean as a non- on confession night that's very good unfortunately the trackpad was terrible and despite it having a 1080p display in it it was just a 60 HZ refresh rate display although its dual Channel Ram configuration did give me some hope for its gaming performance at least in terms of an igpu so um yeah let's see how it games this is a 1080p low settings and it's not going very well oh my God it's performing so inconsistently sometimes it feels reasonable about as re reasonable as 40 frames per second can feel but then you get these big lag spikes that just get you killed so hard in CS2 okay so it's been a while now I mean I was literally about to say that it hasn't stuttered in a while and then that happens now when the stutters do eventually calm down mid 50s a 1080p low for CS2 is not an impressive result for a gaming laptop especially not at this price point which will again discussing a little bit uh but at least the temperatures are good look at that because it's not doing much the temperatures are good it's also quiet now with doom Eternal at 1080p medium settings which is not very high this isn't a game that's super hard to run it's worse than CS2 it's about 26 frames per second and it uh it really feels that way to be honest um but I will say this is on the border of being playable fortnite at 1080p with everything low but epic view distance it feels very CS2 it's playable but it really it just straddles that border that minimum however does mean that if you ever meet The Z in a Lobby you're almost definitely going to be able to destroy him because yeah know this isn't a super competitive experience you can see here that there's quite a lot of big stutters as well I think that's a pretty normal thing with fortnite but at this low frame rate those stutters feel really bad oh Jeff is this really how you game this is terrible at 1080p low settings cyberpunk isn't able to break 15 frames per second although maybe Jeff understands the power of Fidelity FX maybe that's how he gets acceptable gaming out of his laptop I feel like we need at least performance here it's quite a bit better but it's still not even 24 frames per second which is the bare minimum for human perceived motion although because of how small the display is the Fidelity FX isn't quite as visible it's very visible but it's less visible than it would be on a 27in display for example so I guess that means we can crank it even harder giggity oh yes we're getting very close to a consistent 24 frames per second although now the visual quality has significantly dropped off it is starting to look pretty bad now interestingly our CPU is working harder than I'd like it to be working at 24 frames per second i' I'd be honest but it's not 100% so we do have the option to just really plum the deaths of savagery here wow considering that it looks like we're gaming in a puddle of pixel vomit it's not running as well as I'd expected to I guess this is kind of in line with what we were getting with the other games so this has to be the settings that BOS uses to game on this laptop I can imagine he's a big fan of cyberpunk considering the themes in the game apply quite heavily to him now you're probably watching the video going e David you're so rude to Jeff's gaming lap toop the guy just lost like $700 trillion the other day and he's clearly having to cut Corners so that he doesn't lose his mega yacht well to prove to you that this is at best like a mediocre Facebook machine I'm going to compare it to this laptop which you can currently buy from Amazon for less than the ace magic and if you buy it from Best Buy you can get it for $150 less oh and in terms of that price it's 150 CAD less than the $900 Canadian dollars I paid for the Jeff toop and for that $150 Canadian doll less you're getting an RTX 2050 now in all fairness the laptop in its stock configuration just has a single 8 gig stick of ram which is going to kick its performance right up the scrotum but you have $150 left to upgrade it with although surely considering that it's had both its Achilles tendons sliced by its Ram configuration it's not going to be that much faster than Jeff's laptop is it oh wow that is a much much bigger number in fact it's more than double the size of the of the Jeff laptops number it does fluctuate a little bit and you can tell that we've got a lot of performance headro left and despite the Abomination to Zeus that is the hp's ram configuration it wipes the floor with the Amazon's Choice laptop and the same goes for Doom Eternal and fortnite but because of the Abominable Ram configuration in the HP laptop that performance is quite variable and very stuttery and in cyberpunk it was n as much faster than the Amazon laptop as I was expecting like those frame rates aren't that much higher on the oh wait actually no never mind I use the Z settings on the Amazon's Choice laptop so um actually the HP is a lot faster and then when you upgrade the RAM configuration in the HP laptop which again we can afford to do because of the price difference the performance Delta in CS2 grows massively in the other games it didn't climb as much but the 1% lows were a lot better so the ACT gaming experience still massively improved so at the end of the day what did we learn in today's video well apparently Amazon's choice is a really good way of knowing what not to buy what a useful tool that is and until the next video thank you for watching bye-bye m",

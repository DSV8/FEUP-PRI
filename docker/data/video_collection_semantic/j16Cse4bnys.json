    "transcript": "Wow whoa I guess we all have nightmares sometimes that's what's burning them a couple of weeks ago but have no fear the SL600M is here good people so I'm actually quite excited about the SL600M despite the weird naming scheme because this is finally something totally fresh from cooler master and this is not an upgraded iteration of what they previously launched this is like a totally new direction for them that ripped the new Enermax lick Fusion is their first addressable RGB all-in-one cooler with a standard 240 ml rad and absolutely beautiful RGB ring illumination on the fence and the pump to highlight that unique flow indicator through the transparent top check out the lake fusion down below alright so the SL600M from cooler master to me is a really interesting release because it's almost like a new direction from cool master they clearly have a new designer who was like enough with this RGB stuff let's stick to something a little bit more mature and I appreciate that because like from a design perspective this is a gorgeous case that kind of stands out from the rest of the master case lineup and stands out from the rest of the cases on the market right now you know there's beautiful very tall aluminum piece in the front and the top this beautiful new mesh material that looks absolutely gorgeous for the top and then you are your they have their with a new motion sensor so as you hover your hand around it will light up those USB ports which by the way has a USB type-c gen 2 port so overall it's like a really nice looking package but the downfall is the price point so here I understand they're trying something new in terms of design and also the interior features but at 200 dollars you have to ask yourself who is your target audience and I know they're pushing their whole marketing thing towards work and play so this could be a gaming system and could very well fit inside an office environment or something that isn't gaming oriented but at $200 you're competing with the likes of the evolve X from Phanteks provided you can actually get one since they're all sold out you know the defined as to just came out from practical design and that is $50 cheaper yet you know functionally it seems to offer a bit more even and so the $200 price point I feel like is the downfall of the SL600M and even if you take a look at cool master's owne cases like the H500M which is also 200 all enclosure it has more fans that are RGB more glass panels more features like all types of tooling that is required so I don't understand why this case is so expensive I do appreciate the new direction with the aluminum pieces it's absolutely gorgeous however the aluminum is so thin you know once you tap on it and you can hear the plastic that is underneath it you know you tap on the Evolve X it sounds metallic here it sounds plastic now having said that I feel like Cooler Master has done a good job in terms of combination of plastic steel and aluminum pieces so that the thing looks amazing but when it comes to like feeling the case it doesn't feel as premium for the price point for the side panels we have nice captive thumb screws at the back and both side panels utilize the hinge approach that allows the panel to almost like you know hang off the frame but here with the glass panel because it's so heavy the actual metal joint or the piece that is attached to the glass is glued on and that glue has started to come off so when I was removing the panel I heard the crackling noise of the glue peeling off and that is not a good thing on a 200-dollar case now it doesn't happen with the other panel because it's steel so it's much lighter versus this giant glass panel now cooler master have confirmed they have fixed this issue for mass production on the factory level and now the glass side panel can withstand 20 kilograms of tension for that metal hinge and the glue so that's nice the bottom is covered in the large dust filter removal from the back and as you can see it is foldable and that is to allow you to remove the filter even if you don't have that much space behind the case which I appreciate the one thing I don't like about the frame is that you cannot pick it up by the only by the sides because that front facade is so magnificent and tall but not exactly functional it just looks pretty of course all the aluminum edges are refined so you're not going to cut yourself they're super smooth and I do appreciate the outline of the Cooler Master logo at the front it's subtle and the branding is not being you know it's not screaming at you and I appreciate that and the only cooler master text we see is on the side inside the power supply shroud which looks nice and elegant I like it now one of the most interesting things about this enclosure is cooler master decision to remove any rear exhaust fan as you can see we have nine PCI slots plus two vertical and an absolutely solid panel where you'd normally find a rear exhaust fan and that is because as we enter inside you can see the power supply shroud area has been totally relocated from the bottom traditional space to the side beside the motherboard there for clearing up all that space underneath and this is where we have to included two hundred millimeter fans and cooler monsters trying to create this chimney effect by having airflow january at the bottom which is why the case is so tall you can totally fit like my entire fist underneath there which is good so there's enough spacing there for those fans to intake air and they push everything through to the top and the top has no fans included but with this nice little bracket you can install up to a 360 rad and dual 200 millimeter fans I do like that the top panel is also spaced out to allow for airflow to exit freely and you can also install fans above the frame which is awesome the top plate can also be removed completely it is two lists and it can also be slightly raised to allow for that additional gap of airflow if you do have fans that are above the frame which i think is helpful and since we don't have the traditional hard drive cage and the actual power supply shower at the bottom storage has been kind of moved around everywhere so we have two SSD slots on the power supply shroud on the side behind the case we have two more SSD caddies in their conventional spots and then we have two of these interesting drive brackets that can be used for SSD mounting or hard drive mounting or any of your water cooling components one is located on the rear fan slaw where that usually is found and another is located on the power supply shroud furthermore we have two more additional Drive brackets behind the front panel that there's not easy to access by the way but there's easy to route because the power supply is right there and it's interesting to see these drive brackets are mounted on a fan bracket so they're clearly recycling this frame but of course you cannot mount any fans there because that entire front panel is completely closed the case supports a ATX motherboards but only up to 272 millimeters because anything above that and with will totally cover your rubber grommets however you can use the additional rubber grommet beside the power supply shroud to route let's say a 24-pin cable or satellite manner so you have a little bit of options but cable management for anything other than ATX motherboards will be a challenge and that is of course because the power supply shroud basically is located on the side of the motherboard and we have that rail system and I find that entire like repositioning of the power supply on to that area pretty refreshing and like working with it it's not like frustrating you just have to remove the first piece and then we have the rail system which is finally coming into effect kind of like being useful where verses in the past that's only been used for hard drives and like water cooling components but now you can finally use it to mount power supplies which is pretty awesome and depending on the power supply length you can reposition the actual main mount higher or lower also depending if you're mounting a 360 rad up top or not and then we have the additional second piece that basically collects all the cables and prevents them from going into you know the rest of the bottom of the case and I find that whole thing works really well you just mount the power supply mount the second shroud kind of to hide all the cables and you also have the ability to mount it on the rail system depending on you know how tight you on the K must to be or slightly loose as for the bottom fan bracket / grill so that no cables get through and make contact with those fan blades we have two 200 millimeter fans which are not RGB and they spin at maximum 800 rpm you can replace that with a to a 360 rad so that's good if you're looking for water cooling and I find that whole airflow section at the bottom at the top is actually pretty good because the power supply shroud is totally out of the way the motherboard is pretty high up so you have plenty of space there for push/pull thick radiators no problem and to recap our cooling options you can do a 360 up top 360 at the bottom duo to 100mm weather fans at the bottom and the top and dual want 40 mils at the top and the bottom and then we have to talk about this whole chimney effect or having that fresh air delivery from the bottom passing through your GPU onto your CPU cooler that has to be mounted facing up and that is one kind of concern for me because in my previous experience with certain AMD motherboards you're not able to have the flexibility of mounting the cooler in either horizontal or vertical orientation so you have to take that into account if the if your motherboard supports it and if the cooler supports it as well and the second thing I was thinking is that yes hot air rises and we have all that fresh air from the bottom but it is passing through the GPU first so any air that gets to the CPU cooler will already be hotter based on the GPU temperatures I also would love to see a compatibility list from cooler master to let users know of what motherboards work and what coolers work so that you know you're not necessarily thinking oh this is gonna be great for my system and then only realize that either your mount or the CPU cooler does not support vertical orientation that would really suck luckily from my Noctua u12s cooler I have no issues rotating that to be facing up but for my RT 2080 ti I did have to remove the additional bracket that is on the power supply shroud because it was slightly pushing down on the GPU and maximum of GPU clearance until the power supply shroud is three hundred and eighteen millimeters so I think it's exactly the length of this GPU because it's very tight it's not making contact with the shroud but it is very close the one thing you can do is remove the secondary shroud from the power supply to reveal all your cables if you need that additional space but yeah otherwise you have 318 millimeters as for cable management absolutely no issues here rubber grommets and all the appropriate patience and I do like that secondary shroud at the bottom that is attached to the fan bracket that allows you to pass all the cables for the bottom on the motherboard cleanly without them actually being revealed underneath the motherboard awesome now the GPU can be mounted in multiple locations we have our standard a horizontal one that probably is not the best for the CPU temperature but the GPU definitely gets all that fresh air then you can relocate the GPU to the vertical two slots which are closer to the side panel window so probably not ideal because the GPU gets kind of hot there but more fresh air gets delivered to the CPU because the GPU is not blocking that and then we can rotate the main PCI bracket window is what they call it so that we can have all our primary PCI slots in vertical orientation instead of horizontal and the advantage of that is having multiple GPUs in horizontal orientation therefore potentially giving you better GPU temperatures because of all that additional fresh air from the bottom and it's not going to one them is not going to be blocking the other if they are positioned horizontally and the interesting thing about mounting the GPUs in vertical position is that there's nothing holding the GPU at the bottom so the actual riser cable just attaches to the bottom of the GPU and into your motherboard it's not actually being supported at the bottom and actually makes sense because that way it frees up all that room at the bottom for potential radiators and we have plenty of room there for you know radiator and push-pull setup and I understand why they did it but you also have to be very careful not to ship the system like that because the GPU otherwise is just being held in by those PCI slots and for the $200 price point the master accessory riser cable is not included so you have to go out on your way by the accessory separately so you can take advantage of the whole point of this enclosure of having the GPU mounted vertically for that chimney effect so that the air can actually get the CPU cooler why not include it you're already paying $200 and so here's my temperature chart with the default orientation when the GPU is horizontal this is when it's the coolest of course all that fresh air is being delivered right there while the CPU suffers with much hotter temperatures the GPU vertical with near glass gets slightly harder but more air gets the CPU and GPU in the middle we definitely get better GPU temperatures and the same CPU temperatures as when the GPU is in near the glass simply because the same amount of air gets the CPU cooler but when we look at temperatures across the defined s2 and the C 700 M sure the GPU is the coolest out of the the three cases but the CPU temperatures suffer so much simply because we don't have that additional fresh intake towards the CPU cooler because it's just getting the warm air from the GPU and that of course is a big negative I also want to mention that going with RGB in here then really makes sense because it doesn't really suit the taste of the enclosure on the exterior and the interior so I populated the Lea nice trimmer cable inside and yeah it looks fine by itself unlike a gaming case but in here doesn't really good look that well and also let's say mounting the inner max TB RGB fans which look fantastic elsewhere but here I mounted them at the bottom and they're not exactly visible and so this case if you're trying to go with lighting approach is good to light up the interior with illumination instead of other RGB components and so to conclude I want to say that you know I'm happy to see cooler master try to think outside the box in terms of design elements the absolutely nailed it here and I understand why they cannot have an entire motherboard being rotated because that would make the case much longer because that's where the power supply shroud is and they'd have to kind of redesign that entire structure and so I understand all these limitations and also appreciate the new modular approach for the pci window bracket but it only benefits the GPU and not the cpu and for the next iteration of this case because you know how Cooler Master does it launch feedback release revised updated chassis with all the things fixed basically but here I would love to see the rear fan mount opened up as an optional cooling mount so that maybe you can close it or open and depending if you want to your CPU cooler chimney of effect or standard horizontal and I would love to hear what you think about this whole thing of moving the entire power supply shroud section to the front of the case where normally you would have some form of airflow or hard drive gauges and stuff but now it's it's the power supply that's that's where it sits and having all that space at the bottom for airflow in the top as well and the back completely closed for you know for air pressure purposes and also noise purposes alright guys that is it for me thanks much for watching let me know what you think of the SL 600m make sure to check out this other relevant content

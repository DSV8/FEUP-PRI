When you combine that with the new liquid-cooled Cardea M.2 SSD and the incredible ARGB T-Force Extreme memory, things are looking \"bright\" for Team.  :P  Check out Team Group's contest:    A special thanks to Phanteks and Steelseries for sponsoring our trip to Computex 2019.

    "transcript": "all right guys so as Computex is winding down we decided to drop by team group to see what they're showing off and interesting enough we were actually really surprised and they always tend to surprise everyone with their interesting products I mean if you remember back vandeyn announced the Asus tough memory that looked absolutely gorgeous in fact we included that in one of our tough series bills if you're interested in checking that out link will be right over here but before we get into their you know new products and stuff I want to give a huge shout out to Phanteks and SteelSeries for making Computex 2019 possible all right so let's start with probably what's going to be the craziest SSD at Computex and that's the t force delta max RGB it basically follows the footsteps of the original delta rgb SSD we looked at last year but this time it's being taken to a whole new level so they've added addressable RGB surround the perimeter and then used a diffusion panel to allow the light to spill evenly across the whole thing and honestly guys this thing looks amazing sure if you aren't into the whole RGB craze this won't be your thing but team has actually worked with multiple vendors to implement brightness adjustments through software like MSI mystic light and asus or a sync pushing those LEDs to the sites also means temperatures are much lower than the delta remember some people had issues with that SSD overheating since it's RGB LEDs increase the in tone temperature in higher load situations a team group has also added a thin internal heatsink to make sure that this never happens again other than the RGB lighting effects the Delta Max gets its power through either USB or a 5 volt connector along with these standard SATA and power connectors while teen group couldn't tell us the price it's available in capacities from 250 gigabytes all the way up to 2 terabytes when it's launched sometime between July and September continuing the RGB trend there's the T force extreme ddr4 16 gigabyte kit with an addressable RGB heat spreader this isn't like anything I've seen before with teams unique dissipation panel it's seriously cool like the whole module is glowing in a subtle color right now the modules aren't all that bright sands they're working with metal manufacturers to validate the modules and their light output but like the SSD expect the modules to get a lot brighter but also have the ability to get down to more subtle output as well continuing with the RGB trend this is actually something we've been hoping for an addressable controller with both 5 volt and 12 volt inputs and upwards alongside one another while there isn't a white channel team is providing for 5 volt outputs on the captain RGB controller box along with 5 different presets that can be changed with the press of a button power input is done via a single SATA connector and expected to be compatible with every motherboard out there that supports 12 volt and 5 volt RGB connectors alright enough of RGB stuff let's talk about water cooling since teen group has something interesting in that area as well this is the cardea M 2 PCI SSD and it incorporates a liquid chamber inside of a traditional heatsink but you notice that I didn't say that this was a water block well it isn't since these SSDs are far too small to be plumbed into a water cooling loop instead the idea here is to fill the chamber with the same liquid as your own loop for color coordination and to do this you can drop back the protective cover remove the metal plug and fill it in with the fluid according to team the team for scardiest water chamber can lower temperatures by over 10 degrees over the naked SSD alone also for those of you keeping track at home the cardia will feature read and write speeds of up to thirty four hundred and three thousand megabytes per second respectively now something that I should mention is that considering that this m dot two PCI SSD has a liquid chamber built on top of it I'm not sure how that heat is going to be dissipated as efficiently compared to something like an aluminum heatsink so I guess we'll just have to test and see how the temperature variances could be in the long term so hopefully I'll be able to get my hands on one of these and give you as my thoughts on it one other thing that I need to mention is that team and the T force group are running a little contest so in it you can actually get the chance to win the new car do is D or 1 up to t1 and TDR for memory case I'll actually leave links to the contest in the description down below if you're interested so that about wraps up our coverage at team group let me know what you guys think about the cardia SSD as well as the delta max RGB SSD as well I'm really excited to you know test out the temperatures on these new you know products especially since RGB is a element or I guess a heat element for that component so yeah let me know what you guys think about these products in the comments down below I mean bar with hurricane axe thank you so much for watching make sure to check out certain relevant content over here subscribe to our boutique on channel for the latest tech news and updates and I'll see you guys in the next one",

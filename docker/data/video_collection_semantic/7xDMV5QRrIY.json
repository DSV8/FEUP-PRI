    "transcript": "Dennis, Dennis. What are... why are you wearing that? ...Because I lost channel Superfun Oh no, hold on, hold on... He's not wearing it yet, everyone's just reading the lines without actually checking the thing. ohmygod, I don't think we ever washed this...yep! Oh God! Samsung's Unpacked Event is tomorrow at 11AM Pacific, but if you are busy at that time, don't worry! because everything has already been leaked out the EEEN-YANG Leaked up the ee n yang. \"Virginia?\" EEN- YANG so the ears look classy or what? We have seen basically every crevice of the flagship Galaxy S20 With this GIANT multiple camera area And now! We've got even more looks at the Samsung's Foldable Galaxy Z-Flip Thanks to the grainy video leaked on the web Which seemed to confirm some of the phone's leaked specs You might think that Samsung would be worried about these leaks, but it doesn't seem like it They leaked a Z-Flip themselves by showing a video commercial for during the Oscars... on Sunday night This is CRAZY WHAT IS EVEN the POINT of the LAUNCH dif-dates anymore!? \"Geez!\" And the Samsung Galaxy Buds. Plus. ALSO leaked ...not surprised with their larger batteries and extra audio driver but they DON'T have active noise cancellation So I guess I'll stick with my AirPods Pro Whow, what? Your an APPLE GUY? *seductively* I'm a bunny guy mobile world congress or MWC is usually one of the biggest shows in the mobile de-industry but it's getting quite a bit smaller thanks to the couuff-*realizes what he is reading* Caronavirus? outbreak nooo, nah thanks that's BAD.. RIley Amazon has announced they are withdrawing from the show which takes place in.. Barcelona!.. Spain ...later this month NVIDIA who was sponsor of the AI topics event at the show has also pulled out like 'pulled out'? ;-) nope! nope! NOT LIKE THAT Along with Sony, Samsung's scaling back their.. presence at the show but the company will still have a booth and employee presence there? For the reports MWC has released, a statesman reassuring attendees that many precautions will be undertaken to ensure the show is saafe and healthy \"whatever you can do ya know?\" Yaa, just wondrr- \"WASH YOUR HANDS\" ...and don't touch your face With store closures in China and product delays in many industries, this is just latest example of how the cover-coronavirus is affecting the tech world stay safe out there, wash your hands, and get yourself a fashionable face mask *strokes face* \"Do you have a good one?\" I have-- my mom sent meee like forty of them *DYINGLAUGH/ cough* and the U.S. Department of Justice has announced charges against 4 members of Chinese military also known as the People's Liberation a-Army ...we have Chinese military hackers, specifically four members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army For breaking into the computer systems of the credit reporting agency Equifax. *Ahhh, that was nice and easy to write up, back to bro-ke-n En-gli-sh* Who they say are responsible for the 2017 Equifax data breach Attorney general William Barr says the hackers broke into Equifax's system using a software voluntarability (vulnerability) that had been publicly disclosed, but not fixed for TWO MONTHS! \"yeeaaahhh!\" can you believe THAT? I can't even check my credit score Personal information such as names, addresses, and financial info for more than 14-7 MILLION Americans was se-accessed along with what Barr quotes, *demonic voice* \"STATE'S SECRET\" and before you say anything, I'm freaking Taiwanese, so don't look.. at.. meeee. *more dying laugh* \"Uhugahuhu!\" now it's time for the QUICK BITS! (good luck here, I ain't gonna write subtitles for something most people skip anyways.) (THESE THINGS are ALREADY hard enough with Dennis doing the English word thingies) RGB (Hello, me from doing the whole video here... NEVER AGAIN...) (I thought that it wouldn't be too bad since I kinda understand what Dennis says...) (BUT I WAS SOOO WRONG) (I'm never creating order out of this guy's madness again... unless I get paid. hmm?) (The quick-bunny-rabbit-bits start at 4:16 ) Like my grandma used to say, \"quick or not beats a bit\" \"and don't forget it\" I will remember Intel has greater plan for it's graphics cards th-th-then when we saw at CES Digital Trends got a hold of internal document essay (presentation) company's Arctic Sound (of Intel's Arctic Sound GPU) GPU could be built using tile modules that are similar to the chiplet AMD user (uses) in their Ryzen processor These could help Intel turn small, less powerful modules, into *explosion* HUUUUGE super power models ...like me (sure) it's like what happened to me when Riley maked (made) me angry Don't make me angry, I will be- *Hands brought up* *FLEXES* Very Powerful \"OUHG! You're so scary\" Some Windows 7 users have been finding it impossible to shut down their computers as the operating system gives them error messages that reads YOU DON'T HAVE PERMISSION to shut down the computer There are some workarounds, and Microsoft in-is investigating but really this is what happens when YOU don't upgrade The computer thinks it's sooo important, it will only shut down when IT want (wants) to You've got to make it remember who's tha boss \"Who's the boss?\" You., ME, I-tha-I am the bo-ME I am the boss (took only a few tries) today for once last week we saw a photo of Microsoft upcoming folding surface duo device on a subway actually? it was on the sky-train here in Cancun WHAT? \"YEAH\" COOL \"we're the cool guys now\" (yes, you can dream Riley) well now the full video has been published and would you look at that it's a Android device with two screens :D it's sooo exciting I can't wait to use that phone with two hands \"like\" \"At the same tah-? ah, yeah. How do you hold it then?\" du-huhuhuhu we've been hearing about Helium Assist Magnetic Recording or HAMR hardrives for years but it looks like thiiis year's might be the year we actually see them in operation the technology will enable hard drives with capacities of up to 80tb to become common place did you hear that Riley!? di-it's finally HAMR time (insert pun not intended joke) \"whoah!? STOP!\" \"duuuuuuu-da- there it is\" and the Oscars are fine, but the highlight from Sunday has to be Taika Waititi Apple needs to fix those keyboards... the-they are impossible to write on, they got- they've gotten worse tha-that makes me wanna go back to PC's (shoulda never switched in the first place) he was actually being asked about [what] the Writers' Guild of America [could] do to help writers but he knew who was truly to blame. way to get a work (word?) out Taika stay strong! also, congratulations on the Oscar for best... adapted screen play \"Did you watch the Oscars?\" Ah... no Alright, that's it for the videos (video) guys. Subscribe to TechLinked and Subscribe to ChannelSuperFun! which will be out on Friday on YouTube \"we get to watch you fail\" (kinda like he did here with pronounciation) no?? yes. i-I'm wearing this, that's, that's why stay tuned on Friday, ChannelSuperFun click in the link below (it's actually in the comments) and like this video please huhahaha",

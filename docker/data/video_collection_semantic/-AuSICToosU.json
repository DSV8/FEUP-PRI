    "transcript": "- I might shart myself. Who knows how this day's gonna' go? - I got scammed by Radio Shack. - Radio Shack doesn't exist. - In 2022. - Radio Shack doesn't exist, man. - That's the whole premise of today's video. We went and found a whole bunch of stores which we can only describe as zombie tech. These are stores that used to be around, went out of business, and then have just revived themselves as really shitty online retailers. - So someone basically bought the name Radio Shack, or something, and have just used it to sell to poor Great Aunt Bertha, who still goes to radioshack.com on her dial up modem to order - I got scammed by them. - CDs. - Not once, but twice. - You have to explain to the children what Radio Shack is. - For those of you who don't know about the Shack, because that's what they were calling themselves when they died. They started in 1921 and they were part of the Tandy Company so they were great for buying computers back in the day. - Yeah. - And then as they evolved, place to get your like little electronics. I bought a lot of them when they went outta business, because as I've mentioned many times in the past, I was the assistant manager at a Radio Shack. Basically their whole sales pitch is that the only reason that your middle-aged dad hasn't bought crypto is because he wanted to buy it from a place where he used to buy batteries from. Also, Radio Shack is just like, they're just known for their weirdly horny tweets, so. - [Austin] What? - [Matt] Yeah, like that's what- - [Austin] What are you talking about? - We did get a couple things. - A hat? - Trucker hat. - Okay. - [Matt] I'm gonna' take that when we're done. - Okay, all right. Nothing like using a dead brand's logo to shamelessly make some dollars, almost like we shamelessly ask you to subscribe and ring-a-ling the ding-a-ling button on This Is so that you too can keep from being scammed by Radio Shack, apparently. What the hell is that? - This is a multi charging mushroom. - It's a remote control, ocean wave projector nightlight. No mushrooms included, sadly. If you're familiar with the concept of drop shipping this is a completely like unbranded, random item that was clearly bought from Shen space Zen, China. Here's the thing, audience, can you take a close look at Matt's face right now? (Matt laughs) I haven't even opened the box and he's like, about to burst. I sat down to record the video today and Matt goes you might take my credit card away after this video. So that's the context that I'm going into here. I will tell you that this instruction manual says patented product counterfeiting. (Matt laughs) So it's a counterfeit of a patented product or they're in the process of, or it's patented to keep counterfeiting. It's a little unclear. So I've got myself a big bowl of mushroom, I mean lights. It's a projector nightlight. So it's got a bunch of LEDs, that I'm assuming just kinda spins around and what not. - How would you classify this? I would say multi charging and a mushroom. - There's no charging, there's just a USB port to plug it in. - Because that is not what we ordered. - Okay, what did you order? - We ordered a multi charging mushroom. - And they just shipped you a random light and said, - Yes. - Suck it, nerd. - So we found the actual multi charging mushroom. - So are you trying to tell me that you placed an order for an item, they sent you some random bull (censored) and said, thank you very much for your $19.99, good sir. - Yeah. - [Kinsey] That was $40. (group laughs) - This wasn't even on Radio Shack's website. - So what happened was you spent $40 on a mushroom from Radio Shack, they sent you this plastic. Are you trying to say it's almost as if you see a very enticing title and thumbnail on YouTube, click on it, and instead you see Matt talking about Radio Shack items for 17 minutes. Amazing. So how much do you spend on Amazon for a multi charging mushroom? - [Kinsey] $24.95. - So they charged you way more money for the wrong item. So we've got ourselves the multi charging mushroom. - Wait how do you plug it in? - Plug it into the back. - Oh, okay. - Do you don't know how to use a mushroom, Matt? (click) Whoa! (click) Whoa! The mushroom is lit. - That feels gross. (frogs chirp) (Matt laughs) We got frog noises to go with the mushroom. Okay, now this combo was a mere 60 something dollars. - [Austin] Not worth it. - So in the frequently bought together- - [Austin] Oh no. - With the mushroom was. - Matt. It's a remote controlled snake with life-like motions. I'll open up the slithering snake. Oh wow, it's a snake. Do we need to give a warning to anyone who's afraid of reptiles? (Matt screams) 'Cause, uh. (Matt screams) I mean, it's a little... - Lifelike. (Matt yells) No, no. (Kinsey laughs) - You know his mechanisms is actually not bad though. (crash) Radio Shack, oh, what gift you have given to the world. - We got one final item from Radio Shack. - Did you get two of these? Okay, there's nothing in this box I can confirm. - Let me try this box. - I don't like this, Matt, I don't like this. Nothing in this box. - We bought a $20 kids tablet. - Okay. - That they charged us $90 for. Twice. And both times it says it was delivered but it was not. (Matt laughs) The first time we said, okay, you know, we're kind of going through a move right now. Maybe per chance it got sent to the old office. But then the second time. - Wait when you say the second time I mean you bought a $20 tablet, they charged you $90, it said showed up. So you bought another one? - Yeah. Literally the only computer that Radio Shack sells is this tablet. It's like a crappier version of like kids tablet. And they scammed us not once, but twice. I guess it's on brand with their weirdly horny tweets because we definitely got (censored). (Austin laughs) So, all right, moving on. Next up we have FYE, For Your Entertainment. Now, technically, FYE has not gone out of business but they have massively shifted their focus and now basically exclusively sell Funko Pops. They actually expanded their online service. - Okay. - To do a whole bunch more. But let me give you a couple fun facts about FYE, For Your Entertainment. It started in 1993 in upstate New York, aka Matt Land. Basically in 2016 they rebranded as just pop culture. Turns out, if you're an elite gamer who doesn't compromise, FYE is the place for you. - Oh no. Matt, how many of these did we take a look at? You can buy these things drop shipped from anywhere for like 17 bucks on AliExpress, and everyone resells them and we keep buying them, Matt. All right, HyperGear Pro Gaming Series. We have like a graveyard of these cheap keyboards. - So many of them. (Matt coughs) Why does it smell like a garden hose? - I will say it's actually got like some fake metal in here and it is like stupid heavy. Like this is like a proper heavy mouse. - We also have a lovely fake Alienware logo. This entire room now smells like a hose. As far as like membrane keyboards go, this might be the worst. - [Austin] The arrow keys also say W-A-S-D. That's not W-A-S-D, my friends. - I guarantee that if I scratch at it. - [Austin] The lettering is coming off. - Yeah, these are stickers. All right, let me hear these headphones. Well, they're immediately some of the most uncomfortable things I've ever felt. (smack) Ow! Oh, did they not include an adapter? - I did not see an adapter in the box. - Cool, can't even use these. - Man, I'm just loving this video, it's so good, there's so many great items, - How much did we pay for? - $39.99 - [Kinsey] Oh no, $47.99. - [Austin] For your excruciatingly poor decision making. - Maybe this ain't your speed. - Don't put this on me, I don't want this. - But you want that. - A Bluetooth wireless gaming controller for Windows, Android, and iOS. All right, so we've got ourselves a little phone holder. - [Matt] Did you just break it already? - I found it. It does have an Android and iOS button. - [Matt] Got it. - It has a micro USB port on the back. I'm not gonna' lie, I don't have any games on my phone right now 'cause I'm on a Pixel. - Yeah you do. Because with the power of cloud gaming. - This is like everything I hate in one video. - And it not, recognized. - The controller is controlling the interface of his phone- - But not, - It's not passed through to the game. So it's like it's a controller, but it's probably showing him more like a keyboard or something. - Also, it stopped with screen recording, I apparently can't screen record while it's doing- - Could my disappointment get any lower? I think we're about to find out. How much was this controller? - [Kinsey] $19.99. - [Matt] Wow! - Great. What a great experience, Matt. Totally worth $20. Don't buy this, ever. - Sometimes after a long day. - Yep. Of getting charged $90 twice for a $20 tablet and not receiving anything, yeah, go ahead. - You gotta wash the day off of you. You wanna vibe, but you also wanna relax because you deserve a spa day. - Shower beer? Matt, do you shower beer? I've never showered beered but I've been told that shower beers are the best beers. - It's a juxtaposition it's, you know, a cold beverage in a hot environment. You know when you're having a little shower karaoke or maybe the shower naps. - So this is a shower holder for your beer that also has a Bluetooth speaker involved. - Yeah. - So it's got suction cups. So you slap this to the side of your shower. You've got a USB, a really crappy little port over your USB so that water doesn't go directly into the thing. You've got a little speaker on the bottom and then it just holds a beer. From Gabba Goods. - Gabba Goods. - Oh, do you hear that? (crack) Sounds like your bones when you wake up in the morning, Matt. I'll put a Boss coffee in there since I'm at work and clearly not drinking a cold one right now. I was like trying to like drink but I sniffed the crappy plastic. This is so bad. - So. - It's not funny to get this scammed, Matt. We've gotten painfully scammed. Here's what I'm really concerned about. You've got like 11 cue cards there. How many more things do we not have? - Do you remember CompUSA? - Oh no. - [Matt] This Staples competitor went by the wayside. They were liquidated and basically they were absorbed by TigerDirect. The website is still kicking. - [Austin] Sure it is. - So we went to go order, we had a whole cart full of stuff. Pretty much the same junk that we have in front of us. - [Austin] Yeah. - Keep in mind, this is an online only store. We cannot accept online orders at this moment, but they let you get pretty far into the checkout process. - Did they get you so far as to take your money? - No, not that far. - Okay, good. - But they definitely took our credit card number. Don't worry, I've been monitoring the situation. The only egregious charges have been from Radio Shack. - What a relief, Matt. - It's hard to call this online retailer, an online retailer if they're not taking orders online. - I'm afraid of every word that comes out of your mouth from this point forward. - The good news is, that's the end of the things that didn't show up. - Oh boy. What did show up, Matt? I'm sure really high quality, great items. I'm staying in my Radio Shack hat until something good shows up. - Where was your favorite store growing up? - Toys \"R\" Us. - No, Toys \"R\" Us got disqualified from this list. - [Austin] Because it's back now. - [Matt] Because it is back. - [Austin] In Macy's, right? - [Matt] In Macy's. - Yeah, maybe we'll go back and do an in real life episode of This Is, exclusively at Toys \"R\" Us. Subscribe, ring-a-ling the ding-a-ling bell because otherwise you'll miss more high quality content like this. This is a Fellowes gel wrist rest. - All of these things I should mention. - No return policy? - No return policy whatsoever. - All right, all right, it's fine. Matt. (thud) (thud) - Oh, ow, that's heavy. (smack) - Ow that's heavy, you're right. All right. (thud) - But look at this lovely polyester material. It really just screams the '90s. - It feels fine to use. - You know what else screams the '90s? - Apple computer being almost in bankruptcy? - I don't remember what this is. - All right, so we've got a keyboard, which is the Seal Shield. What, washable keyboard? - [Kinsey] Apparently it claims that it is dishwasher safe. It's medical grade. - So when you got all that bio juice on your keyboard, you could just pop this bad boy in there. - Are there dishwashers in the hospital where they just toss the keyboards in? - Yeah, of course, third floor. - I will say it actually doesn't feel terrible. Like it's, oh nevermind. - Oh, oh, is that Mister Universe, 'cause he be flexin'. - All right, let me actually try to type on this. Actually, it's not terrible. - That doesn't sound terrible - Obviously it's a membrane keyboard. - But it's a membrane keyboard that if you ever get dirty you could just pop in the dishwasher and you're good to go tomorrow. So not only can you finally get a shower, but your keyboard can too. - Are you self-reporting right now? - No, I'm talking to you, Ricky. Your mom sent us some text messages. She would really appreciate it if you went and took a shower. What we have next is the gem of our collection. - Wow, that's really saying something. - The jouse. - Is this a jean mouse? - They partnered with JNCO jeans to bring you the jouse. - [Austin] It's the iMouse S80 wireless fabric mini mouse. - What's wrong, babe? You've hardly clicked your jouse. Now, we did not pay the extra $140 to get a distressed model. - Ew, that doesn't even feel good, that just feels bad. - This feels exactly like denim. - No, it does not. It's like the La Croix of denim. - I love how you keep calling things the La Croix of stuff but you drink the most La Croix out of anyone in this office. - Fair. I'm the La Croix of YouTubers. Oh my god, Matt, there's the batteries in here. This is in fact the best item we've had today. - It's, uh, tiny, it's pretty small. - Yeah, but it's got a selectable DPI so you can pick between slow, slower. - And it's got the- (laughs) Feel those side buttons. - The button literally goes inside the plastic shell like you can push it so far that like it actually is hidden. You got your headphones, just be prepared. I'm gonna' give you a little as ASMR here. Listen to what this sounds like. Like that's not denim. Like that's not. - Here, stand up for a sec. I touched his butt. (ding) It's not the same sound. Where do you think we got all of these accoutrements? Including the jouse. - NCIX. - No, Circuit- - [Austin] Really? - Mother (censored) City. Fun fact about Circuit City, it is one of the best places currently online to get PC hardware. But like, subscribe, follow. Let us know what you think about all these zombie tech stores. What was your favorite item and why was it the jouse? Like, follow, subscribe. - I am gonna' personally file a complaint with Mr. Shack. I want my money back. - No one out Shacks the Shack. - I'm gonna' call Shaq and have him (censored) 'em up. (calm music) Ah, no, no (Kinsey laughs)",

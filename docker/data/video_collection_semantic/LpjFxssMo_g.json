    "transcript": "(case clicking) - We have got the Cyber Board R3 from Angry Miao. I think it's Angry Miao, that's what Andy told me. This thing is supposed to be pretty nice. It's one of the most expensive keyboards I've ever touched personally, it goes for between I think 400 and 600 US Dollars something around there. It's pretty sweet, it's got this huge LED screen. I admittedly have looked at it already very briefly. I just... I heard we got it in and I couldn't help myself. I raced down a logistics, I opened the case I looked at it, I pressed a key. That's it, but I'm sorry. Let's check it out. (case clicking) Comes in an amazing case. Like you're paying 400 plus dollars so I hope it's nice. Wow. Check this out. You see this, nice foam. I mean, when I buy a premium keyboard, this is kinda, I don't really expect this every time, but if it's like pre-built for you, at least you can get this in a base kit as well. So if you wanna put it together yourself, you can totally do that. If I recall correctly, it's all hot swap and 75% layout. I don't know. Let's take a look. This thing's heavy. Oh men. (keyboard bangs table) (man laughs) Bonged as soon as I dropped it. Honestly, part of the appeal to this isn't even the keyboard itself, it's... Jesus hurts just picking it up. It's this guy, right here. Oh, there are stickers. Okay. Sweet. I'm already totally fine with this. I guess my only complaint is I don't see any sort of like key cap puller or switch puller. That being said, honestly, if you're buying like a $500 keyboard, you probably have those already. So it's not the end of the world. This isn't really entry-level, nothing too extravagant. I think I'm still mostly impressed by the newbie wifi stickers, but that's okay. And so if you want to take this thing apart, which you can, except for the screen, you just pop those off and then pull the back off. Oh man. What's on the bottom there. Oh, that's huge. I don't know what that is in the center it looks kind of just like a weight or something. This thing it's like a 10 degree typing angle. - [Jamie] Wrists hurt yet? - No, but I'm very curious to see, like just how bad 10 degrees is. Mine is... Most of my keyboards are like five degrees tops actually kinda like a flat keyboard so I am excited though. Yeah, it feels pretty good to type. I really like this thing already, but what I wanna check out is the screen on this thing. I want to find out what switches they sent it to us with. It feels like just some linear, don't know what. So let's take a look at the screen, but not until a word from our sponsors Ridge Wallet. Thanks Ridge Wallet for sponsoring today's video. They've a compact wallet to keep your pant bulged down. They've got RFID blocking plates to keep thieves from stealing your info, they come in over 30 colors and styles, including carbon fiber and Burt titanium. Save 10% and get free worldwide shipping at ridge wallet by using offer code circuit @ ridge.com/circuit Okay, so actually before I peel this off, I'm gonna read all of it. It's got DIY LED effects. Oh, it's actually got all the little hot key presses. It's got... You press and hold for three seconds to turn it on and off. USB must be connected on first boot. Okay. That's fine. Yeah. It's wireless. So part of this is the battery, but you can use a wired, like most keyboards with the USB-C cable. (laughs) I hope that once you put it down, somewhere, it staying there 'cause good luck moving it. There's no, there's not much for feed on the bottom so it's hard to even get your fingers underneath it. That being said, the feet grip pretty good. Like this thing, I mean the weight of it, coupled with the feet make sure that it's not going anywhere, which is great. We have got the West Henderson inspired color styles. So it comes in three different ones. There's the white and black versions that are still available, but they made three new ones that are all kind of pastels. The other cool thing is this actually has like an anti counterfeiting feature. So once you've got your board set up, register it and then that way, if you ever buy a new one kind of... I hate NFTs, but kinda like NFTs, it'll be in the database and you can basically look up if you ever buy one secondhand, whether it's counterfeited or not. It's kind of like how Rolexes all have the numbers on them and stuff. Yeah. This feels great. Sounds amazing. The stabs are decent, even pushing on the outside there's not a lot of wiggler rattle. So first I want to see what's underneath this and then we'll do some measurements to check the weight and the size of it. I, once again, as much as I love this aesthetically, and it's not too hard if you start from like a different key cap that's not the inside or that's not the outside, but I like starting from the outside and then going around and then even this escape key, like this is going to be kind of a pain, to get this out because it's just so tightly in there. It looks amazing. It's kind of a pain to swap stuff. The reds though, so they are linear. I don't know if they're just cherry reds or what, we can find that out later. These look kinda cool though, they've got like a, like an orange bottom. Sorry. These switch pullers kinda suck. Yeah, this is gorgeous. So they've got these reds with this orange bottom. Short circuit banana for scale and it's like one and normally these are about one and a third long. This guy's a little more like one and a half. My only issue is like, I haven't really looked at the LED panel yet, but I'm worried that since it's sitting in front, right, like this, you're not actually going to see it all that much when you're using it and then I know like myself, I have my desk up against the wall, so no one's gonna be, you know, in front of my monitor, looking at my desktop like that. So it feels a bit wasted, but I haven't turned it on yet so let's take a look. So actually one thing that I'm kinda complaining about right now is this didn't come with a cable and I'm a little disappointed because you can't even turn it on the first time without being plugged in. Luckily I bought some cable mind cables and they're here. It's like a $500 board so I guess they're assuming that you have your own custom cable at this point. And that's probably a pretty fair assumption, but it's still incredibly disappointing that you don't get even just a cheap C to A or C to C cable here. Because like, for instance, right now I've got to go and grab a cable. (melancholic music) So check this out. So yeah, each of these... maybe it is like an LCD and those are just configurable. I'm not sure, either way there's like a whole website where you can basically make your own patterns for this thing and you can have it. You can set up key frames and stuff too, so it can be like, press a button and then it's like, spells my name pixel by pixel. It's not pixels, but you know what I mean, cell by cell. Super cool. I'm not gonna sit here and configure it for like a half hour, but I will check it out. Oh, that's RGB. Oh, okay. So now I've got RGB underneath. Yeah. That's the other thing that's on top of this panel, there's lights under here on the, on the board and it looks really nice actually. Like it could shine through more. You're seeing it mostly in the gaps here. F10, oh F10. Ah, okay. So F10 turns this panel on or off and then you can configure it online. I don't know what else we can do though. Oh, F12. Oh my God. Sorry I'm gonna change the keys in a sec. I finally found the function change the panel. Oh, this is amazing. Is it worth $500? I don't know, but it's really sweet. Like this is so (beep) cool. Yeah. And so there's like... There's a bunch of different patterns. It'll show you your battery, how far it's charged. You can... And then, like I said, you can make custom ones as well. I'm gonna go with the car. You know what? I actually can see that pretty well. Just from sitting down and with windows 11, moving your clock to the wrong part of the screen while it moves it to the other display. It's on your main display, you can't see while gaming it's frustrating. This would be amazing. And I am tempted to buy this board for this feature alone, which is stupid, but I love it. I, I can't even, I can't even type properly because I'm so like, oh my God, this feels so good and it sounds so good. I'm making all these errors. This is going to be one of my worst typing tests. Okay. I got to redo this one and just try to be objective about it. Oh man. Yeah. It's, it's garbage but this thing. It just feels and sounds so good. Oh my God. I think that this is the nicest keyboard I've ever typed on. And I really want one now, and... (laughs) I don't even know what else to say I just want this thing. - I know. There's probably nicer keyboards to like, this thing is for me. And I was really worried about the 10 degree typing angle, that's probably part of why I'm not going as fast as I normally can. It's pretty steep, but you get used to it. And I think with a wrist rest, that would actually help a lot. Right now my wrists are just kind of sitting on the, on the desk right now and that's not ideal. It's like 7.015 pounds. I'm just going to unplug it. And then yeah, that's the, that's the beauty of it is too is it's wireless. So if you need a wireless solution, but you still want like a crazy expensive, decently high end board, this is a good option. I think they're starting at 400 and then they're selling later for like 600 or something like that. I just looked it up quickly before coming down here so I could be wrong. You've got all your F keys, you've got your Arrow keys and there's a bit of a divide, but it's not huge, but it's not that like 70% or 80% compact where there's no space like here, we've got a nice separation at the top between the F keys and the rest, even in the rows of F keys there's that separation that you'd see in a normal layout, but the bottom, I figured this out. So this thing also comes with a charging mat and I'm pretty sure, let me peel this. I'm pretty sure that if you want to stay wireless, this is actually the like magnet and induction stuff for wireless charging. So they sell like a cyber mat or something like that too and so you can get both of them and then put it on your desk. I think you have to plug it in the first time it's connected , but after that, I mean maybe that's why they didn't send us a cable is because this thing can just sit on your desk wirelessly, indefinitely. Right? I still don't know what this LED is here for, but whatever. I don't even care. I just love this thing. I want to keep this at my desk forever and ever. Do I want to spend 600 US Dollars on a keyboard? Yes. Should I spend $600 on a keyboard? No, but man if you want something nice and you've been waiting for a board that's like a statement piece. I think you've kind of found it in this thing here. Yeah, that is the Cyber Board R3. If you enjoyed this short circuit, maybe check out some of our other keyboard short circuits. I unboxed the Vessels 85 recently. So thin. I think it was a thin mechanical keyboard with like low-profile getter on switches in it. That was fun. Thanks for watching. Subscribe to Short Circuit.",

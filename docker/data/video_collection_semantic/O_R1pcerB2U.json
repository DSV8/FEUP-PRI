    "transcript": "- [Justine] The question is, will the suitcase close? We are on our way to Austria. So I've definitely shoved way more in here than this. I think it's gonna actually close. Well if that's the case, I'm gonna put one more item in there! Hey Siri, turn off all the lights. Okay. One more sweater, because, why not? (forceful zipping) Oh God, this is heavy! I also had to leave half of the things that I had packed, so all of the stuff on the floor was previously inside of my suitcase. But I said no. Gotta draw the line somewhere. I'm only gonna be there for a few days. Sorry! Didn't make the cut. (happy adventure music) Hello, Jenna. - [Jenna] I don't know what else I have cause... - I don't know what else I have either but, honestly, we're not going for very long. - I realize. It's the same week we return. - Yeah. I packed a lot for not a lot of time. (playful exciting music) Step one of one: get to the airport. We made it. (playful exciting music) (Jenna pouts) (Justine laughs) Okay, it might be dramatic, but this has happened many times before. I usually carry a very heavy backpack, but I normally am smart enough to bring a roller bag because anytime my backpack is too heavy, it puts so much pressure on my shoulders that I start feeling lightheaded, and I wanna pass out. - My backpack's really heavy too, so, I'm gonna use your purchase. - We're gonna be redistributing everything. But, we made it to the lounge. We have...how much time do we have? (Justine giggles) - Hour and a half. - 11 hour flight. We fly to Munich and then we fly to Graz. And then, that's as far as I know, what's happening. (bag crinkling) Jenna! I'm like...this is 20 pounds. - [Jenna] (mumbles) brings me cords and brings me snacks. I told Jenna that I have every single USB cable that was made in the past 20 years, so (laughs) we're definitely set. (upbeat dance music) (Justine laughs softly) I'm basically repacking my entire life. We've not even been gone for an hour. - Nope, we haven't been. - Okay, we're hopping on, Jen. - We are? - I have so many Netflix shows to watch. I'm gonna be prepped. You were always taking time, baby. Looks like there is a hot spot up there. - What does that mean? - That means wifi, hello. Lax is happening. Playing with you. I was calling out your name. - What do I do now? (giggles) What do I do? - [Justine] I don't know. Be quiet. (laughs) (upbeat dance music) I don't even know what's happening. (upbeat dance music) - Das brot (speaks German) Bernd the bread. - [Justine] Jenna's learning German over here. So sleepy. (calming flute music) (flight attendant speaking) - [Jenna] Don't do it. (pained exclamation) (playful orchestra music) - Do you wanna get a drink with me? (Jenna exclaiming) I'm so sorry. We were traveling last year. We were in the Munich airport so many times. (playful orchestra music) I made a really super silly mistake. I thought I was getting regular water, but I bought sparkling water. And I waited in line, probably like 30 minutes to get this. And I had two options: I had classic and I had natural. And I was like, well classic sounds like it would be classic. But, I don't know. I'm thirsty. So I'll never make this mistake again. Because, (speaks German) means... I'm definitely pronouncing that wrong... means with carbonate. (upbeat dance music) As we boarded the plane, we got KitKats. Everything is gonna be okay. (upbeat, bass thumping music) It's snowing. We don't have jackets. Because we checked them. (upbeat, bass thumping music) Made it! (upbeat, bass thumping music) Look! There's like a snack. Okay, locks automatically. What? - I have to go outside? - Really? (laughs) This room is so cute! - This is so cute! (upbeat, bass thumping music) - Hey. Hi, so I'm in Austria right now, and I'm waiting for my sister to come over to my room because we are gonna go out and explore today. One of the things that you guys told me on Twitter, is there's currently a cold front coming through Europe right now. So, we kind of chose the coldest time possible to come to Austria. But why I'm here is, I'm doing the launch of the new Jaguar I-PACE. It's a new electric vehicle that they're announcing. Or, potentially, when you're watching this, they've already announced it. But now I gotta get suited up because it's super cold out. (dramatic music) Here we go. (dramatic music) So it's been great because we're here with Jaguar, they have a car for us. So we have someone driving us around and taking us to some cool destinations that we have picked out on a map. But he's not actually from Graz so he doesn't really know the streets that well. So we're kinda sorta trying to figure this out together. We're trying to find the Clock Tower. This looks like a tunnel of... - I think... I don't think... - That's right where we wanna go? - Can we just go down there? I feel good about this. (laughs) Where are we going? - I have absolutely no idea. We're going inside of a rock. Is this where we go to die? Is this a geological dig? Why did we decide \"Hey, let's go inside the dark dungeon\"? - I don't know, the driver said he could get good on there. I said \"okay.\" But, he's not from here. - He doesn't live here! - Okay, it's not that dark, there's lights. - See the Clock Tower was... up. We're going down into the earth. Let's just go look real quick because we're here. Oh, there's a soda machine. (Jenna mumbles) Oh, jeez wow, that really was quite shocking. (shoes clanging on metal step) Okay, let's go back. I feel like this is some sort of archeological dinosaur dig and I know that we're supposed to be going up so this is not right. Restaurant, toilets...Clock Tower. (taps loudly) - Wait, isn't that it? It's right there. We just gotta keep going up. - Can we go somewhere warm? Yeah, we gotta go somewhere warm. This is chilly. We're coming up onto the Clock Tower now. Something that we've been searching for for the past 35 minutes. (sophisticated lighthearted music) Can we go in it? I almost fell. (sophisticated lighthearted music) How do you say cold in German? - I looked it up. - Ish bin cold? - No. - So we saw a bunch of nice views up here. And now we have another place that we wanna go. It's like this little glass bridge that everyone said that we have to go check it out. It's on the way to a museum and there's also a cafe inside. So from here, that's where we're gonna try to go. That's it! That's where we're going! - That is it. Way down there. - So we go from there and then the other museum's over there. How we get there I don't know. I got walking directions that are basically, he said, \"Hey, be careful cause these directions are in beta.\" And the walking directions took us basically walking over top of buildings. Where do you think this elevator goes? You need to get tickets. Where does this take us? Well, should we try it? - No! - Look! English, here. Two tickets. (Jenna mumbles) But this can take us somewhere! Oh, this takes us to a downhill lift. Let's take it! But where does it take us? Oh no. I guess... Do we get in? Let's go! - [Jenna] Take your camera back, this is fun. - Come on! - [Jenna] Okay. Here we go. - Oh no! (elevator speaks foreign language) - [Jenna] We don't wanna go to (badly copies foreign language)! - Well, where do we wanna go? - [Jenna] (badly copies foreign language) Oh my God, I just got instantly terrified. - I don't know where we're going. I bet you that-- - [Jenna] That we'll go right where we showed up? - Look up! Look up! This is right where we started! (doorbell rings) (Justine gasps dramatically) (Jenna laughs) (card reader beeps) Except I'm not sure if this is-- - [Jenna] I don't think that worth six Euros. - I don't think this is exactly where we came out though. - [Jenna] Shoot. - That's a problem. (Jenna talks to camera) We might be somewhere else. - Oh! This is what I've been seeing in the pictures. - Actually, yes! I saw this as well. So I think from here we possibly could even walk to that place. (relaxing slow beat music) My fingers are freezing. This is actually one of my favorite lens for this camera. It's a 16 to 70 so you can get super super long. (relaxing low bass music) New lens, new shots, who dis. (laughs) (relaxing low bass music) Back out into the cold. We had delicious lunch and now we're gonna go check out the museum. They said this is called the \"Friendly Alien.\" (Crowd mumbles) We have to store all of our items. We can vlog on our iPhone. See you guys later. I'm gonna put you in the locker. (relaxing low bass music) - [Artist Voiceover] Conceptual direction somehow. So I think it's important to look at these things as sort of formative experiments. (fast-paced low bass music) (cheery fast-paced low bass music)",

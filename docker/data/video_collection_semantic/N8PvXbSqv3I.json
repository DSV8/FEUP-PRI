    "transcript": "- [Krazy Ken] So top right edge. Okay, that didn't do anything. Cars maybe, that's not a car. Settings, where is the settings app? Eh, I got this. Oh, okay so I know how to close an app. I've reached my time limit on app store. I'm in Safari. I officially have no idea what I'm doing. (upbeat techno music) Hey guys, how you all doing? Really? That's great. You know what, I was doing great earlier. You know, just chilling, relaxing, and then I found out iOS 12 public beta is available so of course since I'm a slave to the Krazy Ken Curse, I have to do something about it in a tech video log and get off my couch from watching The Amazing World of Gumball and leave my s'mores behind to entertain you folks. So let's get started. We're gonna install the iOS 12 public beta today on an iPad Air 2. I enrolled in the public beta program I think quite a while ago and it looks like the page has been officially updated for iOS 12 so now is the time to do this. We're gonna back up the data, install the profile, and hopefully get that public beta on there. All right, oh, first try, that was nice. So I back my iPad up to iCloud regularly. It just does it every night, but for something like this it's actually recommended to have an archived local back up. So that'll be our first step. There's iTunes jumping like a jack rabbit in the dock. Okay well I'm not gonna install another version of iOS 11 because we're gonna install 12. This year we put a 12 on the box. So yeah here's my iCloud automatic back up. We're gonna change that to this computer and we're gonna encrypt it, set the password. Oh and it automatically started. Okay, so we're gonna let that finish first and then we'll get to more of the fun stuff. We wanna make sure we have something to go back to in case shit hits the fan. Never before has the screen radiated with so much excitement. You wanna watch all 20 minutes of this? Just kidding, yeah, the estimated time remaining has been bouncing around a little bit, but what can I say? It's transferring at USB two speed. (laughs) Yeah, about 20 minutes remaining. You've got to think of something to do during this time, so I'm open to suggestions. I did just subscribe to Hulu and I have a 192 unwatched episodes of the Amazing World of Gumball and that might take about 20 minutes to finish, I'm not sure. Also I have Kill la Kill, this is the subbed version. I might wanna try with the dubbed version though. I'm sorry, I'm a dubbed guy so don't hate me. But anywhozzle, let's see how much did that pass, oh. We time traveled. Apparently we just jumped nine minutes. Oh my gosh, we have to go back. Marty, get the DeLorean. Ah, I feel like I did that joke on another episode. Oh, we're at 10 minutes now. Hey, remember this SpongeBob episode? Backing up, backing up, backing up, backing up. Krusty Krab's pizza Is the pizza yeah for you and meeeeeeeeee I'm not a chronology expert but it's said less than a minute for more than a minute, oh, now 10 seconds, okay. Oh five seconds, three, two, one, zero, zero. Negative zero, negative 0.0, negative one. Don't make me punch you, computer, 'cause I will do it. You've seen what I've done to that hard drive case. (giggling) (panting) Good times except they're not. Okey dokey artichoke, now with our backup complete, let's go through the beta thing. All right, guide for pubic betas. So yeah, yeah getting started yada, yada, yada. Learn more about iOS 12. Oh wait no, that's where I just was, what the heck? Oh enroll, that's what I need to do. So enrolling typically gives you some information and then you can download the profile, yada, yada, yada. Download profile, boom. The website is trying to open up settings. No, actually I'm not gonna allow that, no. I'd like this to be done a different way please. Verified, that's good to know. (laughs) And we should probably read this. Oh, it's not that long, oh it's consent. Well at least it's asking for consent, that's good. That has a much better ring to it than terms of services or some bullshit. Yes, restart now. So I actually have another iPhone that would of been perfect for being like a beta testing device so I didn't have to use one of my daily devices, but the screen was a little too smashed and I thought that might be kind of annoying, but oh well we got this. I mean, my iPad it's okay if I put iOS 12 on here. It's not used as much as my phone. So as long as my phone stays on a stable release, I think we're Gucci but sense it's on iOS, it will never be a stable release. Oh, just kidding, 11's okay. I'm still like on .2 I think. Restart complete, captain. All right so now this is the part of the show where we go to settings, go to our software updates and magically iOS 12 will show up, right? Right? This seems a little dark. iOS 12 public beta, look at that. And this is gonna be a lot easier to install than when I installed iOS 11 public beta two when I was in Pittsburgh and I almost downloaded the whole thing on my data plan. Yeah, that was smart. That was a good time. (laughs) - [Brainiac Brent] Did you say something about Sprint killing you? - [Krazy Ken] Oh shit, stop, stop, oh my gosh! (laughing) Turn it off, turn it off, turn it off, turn it off. (stammering) - [Brainiac Brent] Well you can't, stop moving it. - [Krazy Ken] There we go, so I guess now would be the time to make a Journey joke and sing. The wheel in the sky keeps on turning But I think I did that in the last iOS 11 public beta Krazy Ken episode I did back in Pittsburgh. I don't wanna repeat jokes, I never repeat myself, I never repeat myself. Oh and just as a friendly reminder, since you're coming along with me on this textbook Krazy Ken's tech misadventures installations sensation, it is tradition that we also test drive the operating system after it's installed. So I will demo off a few things as I try them out for the first time. Stick around for that. There's nothing else better you could do with your life at this moment. So stay right where you are. Ladies and gentlemen, we have installation screen. All right so, so far no problems. I typically don't have problems installing Apple beta software. In fact, I typically have more problems installing the final release. (laughs) When I don't wait for the data updates. Cough, hi Sierra. But yeah, the beta stuff usually works A okay in my book. So, yeah we'll have a progress bar update tonight at six. Houston, we have a black screen. Oh sorry, it's back, it's back. We're good, ladies and gentlemen, we're good. Staring at an Apple ten stories underground for you to enjoy. Where did I go wrong I lost a friend Oh wait I never had any This is the end Well, I got a move goal achievement while just sitting here watching iOS 12 public beta one install. I have my doubts that this thing is calibrated for fitness. I don't know, maybe it was just the intense excitement that translated into me burning calories or some shit. Progress bar is gone and there we go. Press home to finish setting up iOS 12. Update complete! Just a few more steps. Data and privacy. Oh, this is interesting. The clock and date now, well the date's new all together, but yeah the clock is now on the upper left. Hm, possibly hinting at an iPhone 10 esque iPad design, hm? Interesting, very interesting, that might be coming soon. Ah, this part. I don't really use Apple Pay on my tablet. Screen Time, okay this feature I am legitimately excited for. I would love to see how long I'm spending in each application. This is interesting, I would love to actually set this up now and yes you have to send analytics on a beta that's kind of the point. And I will update manually. Quick access controls, okay, swipe down from the top right edge to open control center and hold on the control to reveal more options. So, yes this is truly now hinting at the fact that we're gonna be seeing an iPhone 10-esque iPad. So top right edge. Okay, that didn't do anything. Let's try that again, top right edge. Okay, that didn't do anything. Oh, maybe continue and then try it. Oh, well okay. Well, here we are. There's the new voice memos icon, that's the thing I noticed first of all things. There we go. Okay so control center is now from there. So I'm guessing that means multitasking is from down here. No, it's not from the bottom, is it? Okay, okay, so it's not from the bottom like that 'cause that's probably how you get home because it's replicating the iPhone 10. You go up and then to the side, okay. So you kinda do that, oh, oh, The Amazing World of Gumball, look at that, that's what I do with my free time. So then if I do this, oh! Oh, they're gonna be killing that home button, it's coming. So I go up and over. Oh and if I go further. Oh, America's got talent. I was actually just wondering if that's on Hulu because I think that was actually the first thing I ever used Hulu for like years ago. (laughs) Cool, so do they have the normal gesture? Oh they do, okay. Oh, that's definitely more like animated and fluid than before. Okay so swipe up from the bottom to go home and it shrinks back into the icon, right? So swipe up and over to switch apps and then I guess just flick a little further, nope maybe not, to go into the app switcher. I'm still figuring it out. Let's open up voice memos. Allow voice memos to access your location. No, not really, don't need that for now. Yes, redesign iCloud syncing. Yes, that's cool. So here we are, let's say we wanna multitask. Okay, I'm obviously not doing that right. Let's say we wanna multitask. Okay, not doing that right either. Let's say we wanna multitask, okay so we can do that and then if we, how do you get to the full thing? How do we get to the actual switcher? I'm sorry, I'm really bad at this, we'll figure it out. (grunting) I got this. Oh, okay so I know how to close an app. I know how to switch apps. How do I get to the actual switcher. Okay so, do you just go halfway? Okay, I feel really dumb. I don't know this new gesture very well. Okay so you go there. Okay how come it me four tries to figure that out? Yeah, they're definitely prepping for a bezel-less, home button list, design that's quite nide with the time now being over there, control center being up here. This thing. (laughs) I mean I'll figure it out. It'll be nice eventually. Okay, let's try that again. So here's here I get into an app and if I wanna go to the app switcher, okay. I go halfway to get to the app switcher or I double click the home button. Can I still do this, four finger thing? No, I can apparently. Let's go into settings which is where? Wait, where is settings? Hang on. Where are my settings? What the shit? Settings, where is the settings app? Okay, this is weird. Am I just not seeing it? Where's the settings? How do I get to settings, what the shit? Color me confused, I have officially have no idea of what I'm doing. (laughs) where's the settings app? What the hell? All right, I'm gonna search. Okay, so settings app. Okay, so it shows up here. So I can put it in the dock like that, but where does it actually live? Okay so now it's there. Where did it go? It like vanished. Is that a bug or a feature? Has anyone else noticed that? Please, if you have information let me know. I had to pull it from the recent, suggested app part of the dock and I put it on my home screen 'cause I couldn't find it anywhere else, that's bizarre . Screen Time, this I am very curious about. Now, it's not really gonna know, oh, all devices? Oh, so it can track across multiple devices, that's cool. It probably just syncs through iCloud. Well, I haven't really used the device enough to see much data, but that is a cool feature. I will maybe get back to you on that and I'm liking the colors that they're using here. They kinda look like our Computer Clan brand accent colors. (hums) lawsuit much? Just kidding. No yeah, I guess I could set privacy restrictions on myself maybe, I don't know. Yes, I can set app limits. So like if I'm watching too much of the Amazing World of Gumball, I can kill my app. (laughs) Entertainment. Let's do one minute, you get one minute of use, young man. And let's go watch some Hulu. Keep watching, oh, what a shock. Yeah, I don't be able to show much of this due to copyright reasons but let's find out what happens I'm just gonna run this for a minute and see what it does. The virus episode, fantastic. Oh we should be coming up on a minute soon. Oh you know what? I just I'm in do not disturb mode. I should still get the screen note definitions in Do Not Disturb mode, right? We're gonna find out together. Okay, it has been well over a minute and absolutely nothing has happening. So glitch or feature, you decide. Maybe do not disturb mode has to be off. So two minutes entertainment, so it was reading that app. Okay, this is probably why it wants us to use categories 'cause it puts categories in the little popsicle stick here Yeah, 49 seconds of productivity, two minutes of entertainment, that makes sense. And the 38 total minutes. I'm not sure where that came from, but maybe it was counting time while I was installing and stuff like that or when I was at the set up screen. Entertainment is selected, I'm gonna set three minutes. Maybe I was already passed a minute, I don't know and it didn't work or something. I'm gonna set it to three minutes, go back to Hulu and go. (gasps) There we go and it showed a little sand timer, that's cool. So you've reached your time limit on Hulu. But it's not just Hulu, it's on entertainment apps in general I suppose. That's cool. So a little bit of self control features in there, right? That's nice. Now the report would be more accurate on my phone, but I am not installing beta software on my phone 'cause that's with me all the time. There's a do not disturb enhancement I think. So, bed time mode, that's what it was. So when you turn that on. Okay, I kind of butchered demonstrating off that feature quick. So I'm gonna try it again. This is actually the following day now. So I have some more stuff to show, but yes if do not disturb model is on during the scheduled time. So for the simulation, I just made it five P.M. to seven A.M. And then the bed time mode is on, this is what happens. It blacks out the screen completely and it says calls be silenced and notifications will appear in notification center. I will be using that, I can tap it and it turn off. Good evening, there we go. Partly cloudy, it's 79 degrees, the high today forecast. I mean, that's some pretty cool stuff, you know? I like that, so now Screen Time, I've been testing this out for a day now. Again, I use my phone more than my iPad so this isn't a super accurate report, but for my iPad anyway you can see we have some more categories popularizing the popsicle stick there and I can look at just today we have our categories< creativity, entertainment, social networking, but I can also look at the last seven days. Here's the report for every single day. I can press and hold and it can tell me the totals for each day. It tells me the weekly total down here and most used apps are sort of down here with the times. So that is really cool. It even shows you the pick up time. Like how many times you pick up your device per day. Now here it says, it even averages out. I pick up my phone once every 17 minutes which two things wrong with that, one this is not a phone, it's an iPad and the other thing wrong with is that can't be true because I was gone most of the day Unless it's pulling information, you know what? I wonder if it's pulling information from my phone even though my phone is not listed here and even though my phone is not running iOS 12, I wonder if it's picking up data because Wednesday June 27th, the first time I used my iPad was now. Is that suppose to happen? You guys in the community, tell me if it's reading data from non-iOS 12 devices. This is also cool down here. It'll show you notification frequency. Around 14 per day. Again, I'm not sure how accurate this stuff is 'cause I'm not sure what it's reading from and it is a beta but it would make sense that something like a chatting application would have a higher frequency of notifications. You know what? I'm looking at this and these bars are looking pretty symmetrical here. So I was at work (laughs) during this time, so there's no way I could of been picking up my iPad but I think it's counting pick up time as notifications because when notifications come through, the screen wakes up and that's probably why these mirror each other. I don't know if that's suppose to happen on purpose or if it's a bug. It is only a public beta so that's my guess for now. That kind of skews the accuracy. I hope they fix that. Okay, let's try to use this thing. Ugh, I still can't use these gestures. Now I'm starting to understand why people were not liking them. I've heard some complaints, but hey, this is the first public beta. I'm sure they will possibly maybe fix it. So I was going through some other features they can maybe test like group FaceTime but I have no friends, so I can't do that. Group notifications, well I don't have friends, so I won't get notifications so I can't test that. The new Animoji stuff. Well I don't have an iPhone X, so I can't test that. The AR stuff, well I don't really like AR for most things so I can't test that. So that brings me down to, well, I wanted to test out the series shortcuts thing 'cause that sounded cool. I go to more shortcuts. Earlier it said no results, now it just gives me the cartwheel of death and I don't know. Wasn't there a shortcuts editor? I couldn't find that app anywhere, so I actually don't know how to make shortcuts. Let's maybe ask Siri. Hey, how do I make a shortcut? - [Siri] Shortcuts let us conjure up new time saving tricks together. And you get to pick the magic words. You can get all the details on Apple.com. - [Krazy Ken] Oh well okay, well let's find out together. I mean, maybe the feature isn't fully implemented yet. I saw it demoed during WWDC. I've reached my time limit on app store. Well, I'm not in the app store, I'm in Safari and why is this still showing me my tabs? And I only put time limits on entertainment so I am very confused as to what's happening here. So I'm just gonna ignore, ignore. Ignore, that's an inaccurate time limit. I don't know what you're doing. I like the little hourglass animation. Let's see, that's privacy features. Yes, Siri can now intelligently (murmuring). So yeah, you can make your own shortcuts with the new shortcuts app, but I don't see that anywhere. So I'm guessing that's still being worked on. So yeah, that's a bit of a bummer. If anyone else got that to work, let me know. I really wished I could of demoed that. So, we'll just ask Siri a random question. Siri, what is 13.5 divided by zero? - [Siri] Please don't make me divide by zero, that would be like me asking you to grow a third arm. - [Krazy Ken] Well, jokes on you, I already did that. Wait, jokes on you, I already did that. - [Siri] Who me? - [Krazy Ken] Oh, I see what it did. It dimmed it out, oh okay. So it dimmed it out because I hit my time limit. That's kind of cool. YouTube is dimmed out but not YouTube studio because that's more for productivity. (chuckles) Stocks, yes. I heard this got a little bit of a face lift. It has the news integration with it now. Yep, market news, there we go. All new design and yes it is now on Mac OS too. So I heard that the photos app got some changes with search and it did have search functionalities before but it looks like they gave it a dedicated tab. I don't think that was there before and they changed the interface and the AI behind it all. So let's think of something to search. Photos, people, places. Well, that's impressive. Woodwind, okay, and there was a location I was at. Woodcote Drive, probably in some other time zone. But yeah, Woodwind, that's impressive. Maybe this was when I was selling a saxophone. What's another thing I could search for? I mean, cars maybe. Well, that's not a car. Carton? I do see this other cardboard stuff like this, yeah, oh carton. There's my cat sleeping in a cardboard thing. So yeah carton, I guess that's kind of close. Oh, the rococo pilot. Yeah, I think this was the original storyboard. This came up under carnival which I guess kinda, I mean an anime convention in way is like a carnival. (laughs) Okay, so it looks like it's categorizing some things. We got mountains, performances, nightclubs, oh yeah and I probably got an anime convention rave photo in there and it detected it as a nightclub. There's cat again, aye, there's cat in the G3. Yeah we've seen that G3 in a future tidbits video, actually. Wink, wink, so stick around. I don't know, Fox? Oh yeah, it got Fox. Even a drawing, it got the actual photo of foxes, it got my crappy attempt at Zootopia fan art, and then it got my Resasuke picture, that's cool. It worked for 2D illustrations. That's some nice AI there, all right. Oh yes, yes, let's do some reading, let's get a book. Let's see, books, it's just called books now as opposed to iBooks. I think they tweaked it up to follow more of Apple's current design language. Except, they're using a Serif font which kind of makes sense for books. It makes sense to me. Yeah, there we go, the Anatomy of Peace. Yes, that's an audio book. So yep, it's combining audio books and regular books I think it did that earlier too. Yeah, this looks pretty. Looks like some recommendations. Extreme face painting, yeah, that's a possibility I suppose. How to draw manga faces, okay, that's definitely relevant. But yeah, I'm digging this interface, it's kind of pretty. Oh yeah, there's a lot of cool stuff here and I can't wait to see where it goes next. So, what is your favorite feature? Let me know and let me know what you think about iOS 12, guys, and next tech video log is Linux Mint part two, the exciting conclusion. If you have not seen part one, do check that out too. Awesome guys, enjoy. Catch the crazy and pass it on. (upbeat techno music)",

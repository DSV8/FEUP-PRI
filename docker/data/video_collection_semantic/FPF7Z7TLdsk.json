    "transcript": "What on earth were they thinking when they built these cases? Not only are they hundreds of dollars each, but the experience of using them ranges from kind of limited to downright awkward. Some of them take up a ton of room thanks to their unconventional shape. It's free real estate. And the dust. This one might as well be an open air test bench with all the gaps in the panels. What do they think they're building? A Tesla? We are about to dive deep into the weird side of PC building. Looking at five of the most ridiculous cases that you can mostly actually buy. Yes, these are real products. And this is my first time seeing them live. And at the end, I'm gonna pick one with your help, that I will be live streaming a building. Which one will it be? We've shown off the ship and the aircraft carrier of the past. But now we've got the spaceship, the tunnel and the tank. Oh, geez. What are you trying to do? Blow up my segue to our sponsor? iFixit. iFixit is celebrating their 20th anniversary and are giving away a free t-shirt with every purchase of $100 or more. Use the code fixitshirt at the checkout to claim yours using the link down below. We're gonna start with the tank from Liqiang. I don't know if that's how it's pronounced. Liqiang. What I know is that it cost us 730 Canadian dollars because it's in stock at amazon.ca, but not.com. Sorry, Americans, you'll have to settle for real tanks. Don't even think about it. It's my hard earned money. This whole thing came packaged very nicely actually in a huge box with lots of protective foam to keep all these tempered glass panels safe. And it fits most, if not all motherboard standards, all the way from ITX to EATX with acceptable cooling on the front and rear. It's surprisingly practical with decent front IO, a USB three, a couple of USB twos, front audio and a temperature sensor. There's plenty of room for storage. Down here in the bottom, it can accommodate up to four three and a half inch or two and a half inch drives. And thanks to the three spots for 360 millimeter radiators, we've got ample options for liquid cooling. If the 175 millimeter CPU cooler height isn't tall enough for you. There's even decent space for cable management underneath. Although you are probably gonna wanna order some custom length cables after taking some measurements because the positioning of the power supply relative to everything it needs to plug into is a little bit atypical. The only major disappointment that any buyer should be aware of is that at roughly $500, it still didn't come with any fans whatsoever. So you'll have to place two orders, one for the tank case and one for only fans. Have you got it bookmarked yet? I bet you do. Next up, well, you've seen the TriStellar. Prepare yourself for the QuadStellar. Infinity. This one is about 300 US dollars and is actually available on Amazon. Although the two reviews for it are kind of negative. It seems that a super cool feature, the ability to control some of the mechanisms through Bluetooth has been removed. As a trade-off though, we are now getting support for most motherboard form factors with this fourth wing, as the board now kind of sits off in the middle here, taking up kind of two of the Stellars. I mean, if it's a QuadStellar, then clearly this is a Stellar, right? Cause that's the only thing that there are four of. This thing is flipping huge. And weighs just over 30 pounds with its all steel construction and massive partially tempered glass side panels. It supports a max GPU length of 380 millimeters and multiple 360 millimeter rads. And also has built an RGB controlled by a three pin ARGB header instead of a controller. So you can just pop that onto your motherboard. Easy peasy. Be warned though, with six tempered glass side panels and sizable gaps along all of them, this thing is gonna be a major pain in the butt to clean. Like how are you even gonna get in there? It also doesn't come with any pre-installed fans and the IO is minuscule. Just a single USB-C port and a mic slash headphone jack for headsets. I do have to say though, I am loving this front power button. Like this is not powering on the computer. This is powering up the computer. It's too bad that these are no longer powered though. It's all manual now. Moving on, if you ever found yourself wishing there were more cases that looked like stuff, this might be the one. Meet the Segotep EDI. It is just screaming to be painted and built up with little miniatures and props to make the interior look like an actual cockpit. It's going for a, relatively speaking, reasonable 185 Canadian dollars on newegg.ca, meaning it's actually within financial reach. And unlike the two we just looked at, this case comes with fans. They're molex powered and certainly nothing special, but it's got them. This is also our first time being limited to an ITX or micro ATX motherboard for obvious size reasons, but it'll still fit a reasonable length GPU with 315 millimeters of clearance, and you are not limited to an SFX power supply. You can see down here in the bottom, it can accommodate a full-sized ATX power supply with space in the basement to stuff all your cabling. Our main gripes with this one are that the top lid here is, in my opinion, actually too heavily tinted, and it doesn't open up on a hinge like an actual cockpit. You could probably force it open, but there are plastic clips that would probably break from use over time. Airflow also isn't the best. Those included fans are just 80 millimeter, and there's nowhere else to put any fans, even though there's plenty of other meshy openings. But hey, you know what you're after? It's the look of performance, not necessarily actual performance, right? The VETROO K2, or the tube, as I like to call it, is an ITX or MATX case with a big 200 millimeter RGB fan at the front. It's got some honeycomb punch-outs at the back and the bottom for airflow. It can fit a three-slot 330 millimeter GPU and up to a 155 millimeter tall CPU cooler. I mean, you can fit so much computer in this bad boy. There's room for a 240 millimeter rad in the top where you'll find another mesh strip, and you can see everything reasonably clearly through the tinted acrylic side panels. Our only real complaints about the tube is that the acrylic feels a little cheap and flimsy, and one of our thumb screws actually sheared off, probably during transit. There's decent front IO though for USB and for headphones, and you can fit a surprising amount of storage and cables in the bottom. You're okay, K2. What the crap is that? How is this so heavy? These open air sort of test bench designs have been pretty popular lately, and the Motif Monument from Yule Beast Designs is one of the cleanest and most sculpture-like options out there. But elegance apparently comes with a steep price of 275 US dollars. It is meant for an ITX form factor motherboard, and this is another one where we would strongly recommend buying custom cables for it, pushing the price up even higher. If you choose to save a few bucks, you can hide a reasonable amount of cable mess between these panels here. And on the subject of these panels, we got the more expensive one that has support for a 240 millimeter radiator, but it comes standard with this smaller back plate. Adding even more cost to a machine like this, you're gonna want all color coordinated and aesthetically pleasing components, like this white power supply from Lee & Lee and this nice little tiny 2060 GPU. But if you're the kind of person who doesn't care about that you can fit longer cards, it just won't look nearly as cute. You will be limited by the thickness of the card though. Good luck fitting an air-cooled 4090 on this thing, like right up against the bottom. And as for IO and storage options, well, there just isn't really any. You plug things into the back of your computer and you plug in M.2 drives. So I hope you're okay with that. I do like the cute little power button, but for the price I would have thought they could install it instead of me having to do it. We got the white version, but it comes in black or gray, and you can choose the faster colors as well. And it's this thing. There are many versions of this case, but this one is ours. The K1 Pangolin style case from Vetru. You've probably seen something similar before, like the Antec Torque or the Cougar Conker, but this one is much more affordable at about 170 US dollars. Pet owners be warned though, this one might as well be an open air test bench because even with fans installed, there are a ton of open seams all along the back of the motherboard tray, all along the front of the case. It's not like there's even any filters on these fans. It is going to be a cat and dog hair nightmare. Aside from that though, it's easily the most normal looking case we've seen so far, which means that considering the mediocre build quality, we had trouble aligning the standoffs for our second in pain of tempered glass, for example, you're still not really getting a great value for your money here. Then again, you're the kind of person who's gonna pick out the prettiest components because you've got tempered glass on every side of your PC. So what do you care about money or time? Because you'll spend many, many hours cable managing it. So good for you. Oh yeah, yet again, it doesn't come with any fans. Finally, we saved the best for last, the case. No, no, it's the Thermaltake View 37. And we might have bought the very last one of these as they are no longer available. We paid just shy of 300 Canadian dollars for ours. That is a lot of money for a case, but when you're already spending hundreds of dollars on fittings and tubing for custom water cooling, this case will probably seem worth it for wow factor. The side panel unfortunately isn't glass, but what it is is curved so that it covers the side and the top of the case. So you can get a bird's eye view of whatever you put in there. It's big, but not unreasonably huge with support for just about any motherboard you'd want as well as three, three and a half inch hard drives and fits up to a 420 millimeter rad in either the front or the side. Three sleds inside not enough for you. This beast can hold up to four more three and a half inch drives on the back or eight, two and a half inch SSDs. It also comes with a vertical GPU mount, though the riser is not included, but if you want a super cool RGB showcase that can support a big custom loop with plenty of storage options, hey, the View 37 might be for you. And the best part, look at that. Damn it, I broke a nail. Man, that hurts. It comes with fans and look, it also comes with this segue to our sponsor. Look, look, it's right there. iFixit, it might've been flawed, but with that right to repair bill being passed in New York, it is now easier than ever to conduct maintenance on your own device. There's no more sending in your phone to the manufacturer and waiting around for it to come back in the mail. With iFixit, you can repair your own broken devices at a fraction of the cost of a professional repair service and they make it easy. They sell all the parts and tools you'll need on their website, which is also chock full of guides. And to celebrate their 20th anniversary, iFixit is currently giving away a free t-shirt with every purchase of $100 or more. Just use code fixitshirt upon checkout to claim your free gift at the link down below. If you guys enjoyed this video, we're gonna have all these cases linked down below and a link to a poll where you guys can be the ones to decide which case I build in. While you're down there, you can check out another video to watch. How about the last weird cases video? The aircraft carrier was sick.",

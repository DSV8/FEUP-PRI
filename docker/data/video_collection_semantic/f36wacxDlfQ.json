    "transcript": "- Hey guys! Jonathan here and every once in a while a special project comes across the channel and this is definitely one of them. I've done a ton of setups that fall under a certain price point or under a certain budget. But I've never gone truly crazy. And for the longest time now, I've wanted to put together a 4K home theater setup with no budget in mind where the audio is equally as impressive as the picture and I think this is it. So the centerpiece of this setup is LG 65-inch E7 4K OLED TV. There are many, many, many attractive things about this TV. And I think first and foremost, aside from the picture quality itself is gotta be the looks and the aesthetic. This feature is what LG is calling picture on glass. So, one you are seeing pretty much zero bezels and two, even in a situation like this where it's not wall mounted. It still gives off the illusion where that picture's is just kind of floating up in the air. Next, I gotta talk about that beautiful, beautiful image. Again this is a 65-inch 4K OLED Display packing a resolution of 3840 by 2160 and yes pixels resolution, those are important. But what sets it apart and takes it to the next level for me is that OLED display. Often times when it comes to TVs, I think I would take a 1080p OLED TV over a 4K non-OLED. In this case, when you can combine both and the get the best of both worlds, it is a beautiful thing. If you've see a good quality OLED TV in person, you know exactly what I'm talking about. If you haven't yet, it is a glorious thing to experience. The picture is rich, it's vibrant, it's crisp and you're getting about the deepest blacks you could possibly imagine. Now this is especially useful if you're watching movies in letterbox. Those black bars at the top and bottom. Those kinda just disappear and get out of your way. And you would have sucked into whatever it is you are watching. From there, you guys know I'm a huge fan of LG's WebOS interfaces. Probably one of the more intuitive interfaces out there. Honestly, if you don't want to buy an Apple TV, a Chromecast, a ROKU, it is good enough where you'll be happy with this out of the box. So, I can go on and on about the picture quality but I also want to give LG a huge shout out for the audio quality and sound bar built into this TV It's honestly the first TV that claims to have good audio out of the box. That actually has good audio out of the box. No joke, if you wanted to buy this TV and you didn't want to spend 500 bucks to 1000 bucks on a dedicated sound bar. You're not gonna have to. It is that good. Now by no means is this gonna replace a dedicated home theater audio setup. But regardless, it is still very, very impressive. Again, I think there's no need to spend 500 bucks to 1000 bucks on a sound bar instead put that towards a crazier high end setup. Where I think for most people, you're gonna be really happy with the built in sound and not spend any money whatsoever. Now as impressive as that built in sound bar is, I want to take things ever further, even crazier. So, these are the Focal Aria 948s and by far these are the craziest and most beautiful sounding speakers I have ever got a chance to listen to. So, the Aria 948s are a pair of 3-way loud speakers and holy crap it is like having a movie theater in your living room. By no means am I an audiophile so I'm not gonna get super technical, super specky or audiophiley over these but I can tell you they sound incredible. Packed inside each of these are two eight inch bass drivers, a six and a half inch mid-range driver and a one inch aluminum magnesium tweeter that rounds everything together. Now what you're seeing here are the white piano finish but they also come in black piano, walnut which both look incredible. And if you guys want to check out anymore specs, details or price, I will make sure to drop a link down below. By themselves these have an incredible amount of low end like to the point where if you listen to them and didn't know, you would probably think there's a subwoofer with this setup. It is that good. But seeing how we're doing things here, I thought it was only fitting to add a subwoofer to this setup. So, rounding out this audio setup is the Focal Sub 1000 F. Again, the Aria 948s by themselves sound ridiculous but if you're looking for that complete balls to the wall full home theater setup. This 1000 F sub really completes the setup. Now the speakers are only as good as the amp that is driving them. So it would make zero sense to have amazing speakers and a subpar amp. Powering this setup is the Cambridge Audio CXR200 which is an insane amplifier. It packs a ton of power, all the ins and outs you can possibly want. And in this case what was most important for me was that it had a 4K pass-through. So if you wanted to add a PS4 Pro, the upcoming Xbox One X or 4K Apple TV, you can do that and still take advantage of the entire setup. So as I dive into the audio quality just remember the CXR200 is the powerhouse behind this, driving this beautiful audio. So, I got to experience these watching Mad Max, Guardians of the Galaxy 2 with a little throwback with Jurassic Park and every time it was equally as impressive. And I'm not exaggerating. It is the closest thing to being in a theater without being in a theater. - My name's Richard and I'm not prepared for my ears to get blown out. (loud sound) - No way. (audio from tv playing) - Yeah yeah (loud upbeat bass music) - Damn - That's loud! - Wow! - The neighbors are gonna be mad Jon! - Have the neighbors complained yet? - It's like we're in a movie theater. (loud sound effects) - Oh, it's like shaking the couch (laughs). - I feel it, I literally just can feel it from here. (loud sound effects) - Yeah, completely like movie theaters. - This is a better experience than like being in a movie theater. - Agreed. - Like, it's way better in my opinion. I'd rather watch this than like you know watching in movie theater. - That sounds, like those are the best sounding like normal speakers I've ever listened to. Like, I say normal as in like not in like a theater or something. Like I'm sitting probably, what, like 10 feet away and I can feel the bass from them. Like that's pretty crazy. - It's, it's sexy sound. It's very sexy. (laughs) - Lastly to round up the setup is a beautiful, beautiful TV console from Living Spaces. Not an ad but Living Spaces, if you're watching, let's talk. It was big enough to hide everything inside which is really important to me as far the aesthetics go. Especially with the amp which is a giant, giant piece of tech. The re-claimed wood look gives off this really, really nice rustic look and I think matches the aesthetics of the entire setup perfectly. Aside from that. Thank you guys very much for watching, hopefully you enjoyed the setup. If you did and you're feeling like being awesome make sure to smash that like button. If you enjoy more setups, make sure to check out these videos here and I will catch you guys later.",

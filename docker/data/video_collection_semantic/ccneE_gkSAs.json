    "transcript": "Youve heard of disposable cameras! Youve heard of disposable diapers! How about, Disposable movies? For this video to make any sense, Im gonna need you to imagine a world in which Netflix, Amazon Prime video, Disney+ (trying to future proof here) and all those other streaming services dont exist. Its a desolate landscape, I know, but thankfully video rental stores existed to help you through these trying times. And, well actually Netflix did exist at this point but they were still only mailing DVDs to you. How quaint. But ya know whats annoying about video rental stores? You have to take the disc back to them. Or, mail it back. What a hassle! I mean, needing to go back to the store? And giving them the thing which I borrowed back? How inconvenient! I mean, its not like Im gonna just go back and rent another thing. Now I have to go out of my way to return my copy of Shrek 2. Eugh. But what if there were a way that I could rent a movie, and not have to bring it back? Dont you mean buy the movie? No! I mean, what if I could somehow bring home a DVD which will only work for 2 days after I open it, and then it breaks itself! All the savings of renting with the convenience of buying! Ill take 600! This rather bizarre idea did actually happen. It wasnt a huge success, and Im gonna argue thats probably a good thing, but in the early 2000s there was an idea to put a clever spin [the PUNS] on optical disc technology. Some of you might be thinking of DIVX, an earlier modification of DVD by Circuit City which was a more technical solution involving special players that phoned in to a central server to verify whether any specific disc could be played or not. You could then upgrade your disc at an additional charge to be playable after the rental period, or even upgrade it to a so-called DIVX Silver disc, at which point you effectively owned that title. Aint that some dystopian DRM right there? But were not talking about that. Instead, were talking about something else. After DIVX had proven itself a failure, a little company called Flexplay Technologies decided to try that concept again and began to market what they initially called EZ-Ds. These were completely compliant DVDs that would work in any DVD player, but that were made with a chemical component that would effectively destroy the disc after two days of being exposed to oxygen. The idea was that you could buy these discs in a store for about the cost of a rental, and since they were sealed in airtight packaging, they wouldnt break down until you decided to watch it. You could then watch the film an unlimited amount of times within 48 hours, after which point the disc would blacken and become unreadable. And of course I have one of these discs right here. It almost certainly does not work but we will try it just in case! Thats right, I havent opened this yet. Were gonna do it together! I moved you a bit closer so we can do this toge-- hmmm. What's that doing here? Anyway, lets open the package. swanky music begins in background Im using a knife like a responsible person and cutting towards me. So this is just very basic [music cuts] . [music resumes] So this is just very basic paper packaging in shrink wrap. [sensational shrink wrap struggles] Very user friendly. And inside we find a little package with some information. And our disc. Mmmmm. This might possibly work, but we will see. This is really, I will say, you would need scissors to open this .. agh .. or some sharp object like a utility knife. So it looks like a normal DVD except the back of it is a very dark red color. This may work, which would be surprising but well find out. I cant see the TV so were just gonna see what happens. [strange whirring noise from the DVD player] Its making really weird noises. Im gonna guess its not working. Its trying again. This is nerve wracking. I dont think its working. I just noticed this For best results, open by April 2009 which is great because that was inside the shrinkwrap so theres no way you could really well I suppose on the shelf it wouldnt matter but if you took this home you better open at least this far to get a sense of when you need to watch this. We appear to be getting nowhere fast. This is attempt 2. It really sounds like its trying its best. Wait. Did it get somewhere? [more disc drive noises] I have to I have to actually look at the screen. I cant stand this. Whats very interesting to me is that the player hasnt given an error. Its just continuously trying to play it. So its almost like it can see something, but not enough to matter. Well, that was an expected disappointment. Since the disc is so old, oxygen has seeped through its packaging and has already destroyed the disc. In fact, the discs only had a shelf life of about a year. If we were in 2008 or whenever this disc was made we would have seen a bright red disc. And it would have, you know, worked. Now, you might think that the red coloring is the special compound which turns black. But it isnt. Instead its a weirdly forward-thinking countermeasure against them newfangled Blu-Ray players theyre talking about. See the black color isnt actually black. Light of certain wavelenghts could pass through it, much like how infrared light passes right through the black coloring of a PlayStation disc. And one of those wavelengths that could pass through this is the blue-violet found in the laser of a Blu-ray disc player. Coloring the disc itself red would block that blue light, so even if someone could manage to read DVD-data using a blue laser (which, for the record, isnt very easy at all and is why Blu-Ray players have a red laser diode, too for reading DVDs) their attempt would be foiled. Are you wondering why I keep calling this black when its clearly a cherry-red? Well, to make filming easier I filmed the written portion before I actually opened the disc. Yep, it was movie magic! Descriptions and images of these discs show that they literally turn black like a Playstation disc, but this disc clearly hasnt. This is why I thought there was a chance the disc may have worked when I first opened it. Either its packaging was somehow able to prevent the disc from turning completely black in the 11 years between its manufacture and today, or describing it as blackening was simply hyperbole and in fact it just got darker. If the disc does turn completely black in the coming days, Ill let you know and provide some pictures in a pinned comment. Well, links to pictures but you know what I mean. So lets talk about what this disc was actually trying to accomplish. When you or I go to a store and buy a DVD or blu-ray disc, were not really buying the movie. Instead, were buying a specific license to watch that content in a private setting for the rest of time. Or at least, for the life of the disc, video tape, or whatever media contains it. Thats what the FBI is always warning you about. You didnt buy a license to show this in theaters. You didnt buy a license to share this on YouTube. You bought one license to watch this one film in your home for your own enjoyment. But, you can watch it over and over again. And once you buy it, youll never have to buy it again. Unless of course you get tired of watching it on VHS and want to upgrade to some newer format or whatever. The cost of making the packaging and the disc itself is almost nothing. DVDs cost pennies to make, but the movie is expensive because of the terms of the license youre buying. If whoever the content owner is can only make money from you once and then possibly never again, theyre gonna charge a lot for the option to outright own the rights to private viewing indefinitely. But, if theres a set time limit on your enjoyment of the film, then the movie studio doesnt have to charge nearly as much. If they have the opportunity to sell it to you again down the road, they wont mind if they only make a few bucks. So, what Flexplay, and DIVX before it, attempted to do was to sell only temporary rights to a film, and thus movie studios would only charge FlexPlay a couple bucks per disc, rather than 10 or 20. And, since DVDs are hilariously cheap to make, FlexPlay could simply sell you these discs for the cost of a rental (about five dollars) and all parties involved would make their buck. The advantage of Flexplay, of course, was that you neednt bother returning to the place you bought it. The disc would simply become unusable and you could toss it out. Now, while this may seem like a pretty stupid idea --after all video rental stores already existed so whats the real advantage aside from enabling even lazier habits-- it could have been pretty revolutionary. Flexplay wasnt just trying to make a consumers life easier. They were trying to enable any business to easily get into the video rental market. Video stores like Blockbuster needed lots of square footage of retail space to maintain their inventories, they needed to track rentals and charge late fees, and in general their business was rather unique. A grocery store probably isnt gonna want to take on all those hassles just to make a few extra bucks. But, since Fle-- its back! How did But since Flexplay didnt require you to return anything, stores could simply sell them like any other product. Any retail establishment, from grocery stores, to gas stations, to office supply stores, to hardware stores could easily get into the video rental market. Simply set up a Flexplay display, order some movies to sell, and watch your profits soar! Except, of course, that didnt really happen, did it? Flexplay discs were first tested in 2003 with a small handful of Disney titles and the test was a resounding failure. First of all, lets be honest, this is a weird product. Youd think that the failure of DIVX would have been a warning that this aint gonna work, and even in 2003 Billboard was skeptical of the product and thought it would create a lot of market confusion. They were pretty correct, as the test ran for only a year before the product was pulled. A large part of why it failed was due to pressure from environmental groups. Disposable DVDs dont sound like a great product to catch on. While it is of course possible to recycle the discs, for the test run Flexplay didnt seem to be that interested in figuring that part out, and of course needing to return to the store where you bought it to recycle the disc kinda defeats the purpose. The convenience aspect sold both to the business that sells them and the consumer that buys them is pretty much lost if the consumer is expected to return, and the business has to handle the recycling. So whats the point? Disney is likely who caused the end of the trial, as environmental groups were pressuring them to stop this Flexplay nonsense. And they did, for rather obvious PR reasons. But, Flexplay would return with a vengeance in 2008. They had somehow managed to get Paramount, Warner Brothers, Starz, and New Line Cinema to agree to licensing deals, and they also convinced Loves Travel Centers, Hudson News, Travel Centers of America, and notably Staples to sell their discs. Apparently they were trying to go after the business traveler who wanted to rent a movie, but was too busy to return it. Or something like that. To try and alleviate concerns from the environmentally minded, they partnered with a company that recycles Technotrash to provide recycling bins at places that sold the discs (which again defeats the purpose) and they also would allow you to print out a free shipping label to return the disc for recycling. Which again. Defeats the point. And now youve printed something. To ship it back. To be destroyed. Apparently Flexplay did offer free return labels during the original trial run, but Really, the whole thing did seem rather stupid. If youre gonna mail it back, you might as well use Netflix and the disc can then be enjoyed by dozens of people. Rather than one. If you have to return to the store, you might as well go to a video store and rent it there. Or, you can just throw it out and be OK with the waste of plastic. And then of course theres this little company. Ah, yes. That one. The product that lets retail establishments get into the video rental business without taking on any of the hassle. Which allows its customers to return their rentals to any of the machines, which are purposely placed in front of everyday businesses to maximize convenience. The product that costs a small fraction to use compared to buying a Flexplay disc, with only a small convenience penalty, or if you were of the mind to recycle your Flexplay disc, no convenience penalty at all. But Im sure Flexplay will do just fine! Well it didnt. At a cost of $4.99 to $5.99, the product didnt make sense at all. Remember that Netflix discs were only $10 a month at this point, and that was for an unlimited number of rentals. (well, unlimited aside for the turnaround time of mailing it back). As long as you rented just 2 things in a month, Netflix comes at the same cost or less of Flexplay. And of course, you could keep the disc for a week and not ya know find that it destroyed itself. Redbox rentals were still $1 per day, so if you wanted to go that route, you could rent a movie for one fifth the cost of a Flexplay title. And thanks to their positioning in front of convenience and grocery stores, you would probably have a reason to go back and return it, anyway. Plus, Redbox does give the retail establishment a commision for letting them use the space for a machine. So regardless of how icky throw-away polycarbonate frisbees may seem to you from a waste perspective, it also frankly just didnt make sense. At all. Flexplay was pretty much the worst possible way to rent a movie at the time. If, perhaps, things went to their plans and loads of bored business travelers stuck in airports decided to pop for a movie from Hudson News, then maybe this would have worked. But, I just dont think that was really a viable market to begin with. If it was, youd think Redbox would be in airports, since you could just return the disc when you get home. But maybe they didnt want to deal with the logistics of discs routinely going cross country or something, I dont know. Pretty much the one sole advantage that you could say Flexplay legitimately had was that the discs would be brand new every time. Youd never have to worry about a scratched rental disc refusing to play, and then the hassle of returning it and getting a refund. But, this concept was already tried with DIVX and people didnt like it at all. Yes, DIVX was a weird product that wasnt even compatible with DVD players so at least Flexplay had that going for it. But the resounding failure of DIVX was somehow brushed off by those pushing Flexplay, and honestly they shoulda seen this coming. Ill grant its clever, and I remembering hearing about it and thinking it was pretty neat. But for a commodity like video rental, a neat gimmick means a lot less than a practical, inexpensive rental. And thats before we even get into the waste aspect. Sure, the production and disposal of an individual DVD probably has a teeny tiny environmental impact, but the Tragedy of the Commons means that as more people do it, the worse it gets and possibly without realizing it. If Flexplay had become mainstream, then imagine a world in which 70 million households were renting one movie per month. Thats over 800 million DVDs produced each year in the US alone, all of which will be intentionally wasted if made by Flexplay. In 2010 Redbox rented over 500 million discs. According to this website I found, the average disc is rented 15 times. So, those 500 million rentals were only made of about 33 million discs. Redbox accounted for nearly half the rental market around this time, so assuming similar numbers across the board, conventional DVD rental would require about 66 million discs per year, vs. 1 billion Flexplay discs. Yikes. So I think its safe to say its a good thing Flexplay kinda fizzled. Yes there are probably a few billion blank DVD-Rs floating around that will never be used, but they werent meant to just be tossed. Producing a DVD with a deliberately limited lifespan seems pretty well of poor taste. And I think that while we seem to live in a convenience-driven economy, there is a line that seems rather crass. And I think Flexplay crossed it. Interestingly, a thought experiment has been floating around wondering if the environmental impact of streaming services, with their vast amount of hard drives and servers running 24/7 sucking up that sweet sweet electricity might actually be worse for the Earths health than physical media. In many ways streaming services are the perfect candidate for a Tragedy of the Commons scenario, because we cant see the backbones that make them work. But regardless, I think we can agree that producing tons of single-use DVDs is definitely worse than simply renting them out the old fashioned way. Before I close this video out, Id like to discuss the patent. The patent that I believe is the principle one owned by Flexplay is incredible. Their patent was so broad that it covered basically any potential way to create a self-destructing disc. Here are just a few samplings: \"In one embodiment... Another aspect of the invention... Alternatively, a timed destruction of the data... They basically thought up as many ways to achieve a self-destructing disc as they could, and wrapped them all up into an over-arching patent. Pretty smart, actually. In fact, it can best be summed up in this one paragraph: Another aspect of the invention is a composition... They even described a disc that would be chemically altered from the light of the laser reading the disc, which could in theory limit the disc to a certain number of plays, and not a specific timeframe. They really did cover all their bases, here. Too bad it was a product nobody asked for.

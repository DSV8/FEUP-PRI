    "transcript": "in today's episode of accepting a whole bunch of random Tech crap from my inbox there's some box smelling action I learned to write whoa this has quite the learning curve to it and I become aroused it being borderline arousing is kind of a problem right [Music] so I think today we're going to start with the smallest package and then scale it up from there so that we can more comfortably accommodate the bigger ones and I think that means we're starting with this one oh we've got a little note on it with what looks like very wildly written Japanese on it I just say it's Japanese because that looks a little bit like hiragana wow the high dock seems like one hell of a dongle it even has what looks like a speaker so that's pretty cool that seems upside down and it smells like the inside of an NZXT AIO box in here which is a bit of a weird smell to have on the inside of a dongle box but anyway let's open that up and then again in what I'm pretty sure is upside down packaging we have the big ass dongle thing look at that this is quite a solid feeling device we've got is that metal no it's definitely plastic you can see the casting lines and stuff there it's also got a speaker Grille and some matte rubber buttons it's a little bit of a click to it you know it feels decent and then going by the call button I'm assuming there's also a microphone in here for like Zoom calls or shouting at strangers on the internet and then in terms of i o we've got a USB 3 and then two USB 2 ports on it but I guess it makes sense right if you're going to plug a mouse and a keyboard into it you don't need more than USB 2 and then finally on this side we've got HDMI and a type c Port but no ethernet which I think is a bit weird for one of these dongles but anyway let's let's move on to the next bigger thing translator earbuds what reading the marketing on the box of the little time Kettle got me pretty intrigued it apparently has 40 online languages and it has up to 95 accuracy that is crazy it only takes between 0.5 and 3 seconds see very intrigued that is very exciting I think the idea of a thing that just translates in your ear is awesome I'm skeptical though it's a very standard looking Wireless earbud Pebble it also comes with a little car that has login details for your app on it and an instruction manual which let's check that out and the manual immediately got me concerned considering that it was riddled with spelling and grammar mistakes which is not a good sign for a language translation product other than the confidence inspiring manual it comes with some silicon tips for the earbuds it also comes with some stabilizers I guess you call them for the earbuds foreign ly it comes with a USBC cable for charging which is very good pull out like that in here we have the little Babel Fish things which have a shape that makes me feel like they may get sued by Apple at some point oh they actually light up like that so that you can see that they're charging and then on the back you have the USBC cable for charging cool okay let's move on to the next thing which has one of the pulley open things to open oh that's always fun oh it's like a writing peripheral for you to make your erotic Hello Kitty fan fiction with or whatever that's cool it looks like half a glove [Music] oh it's like a palm rejection glove right so that the tablet doesn't get confused by your palm okay what if you have 18 feet across hands like it's I mean it barely fits my hand I you know I guess it makes you feel like you're in the future Dollar Store future but future nonetheless aside from the half glove you get a square USB to type c cable some extra keycaps a USBC to square USB adapter and then finally we have like a like a Sim ejector looking thing we'll figure out what that's for later and I think this maybe the pen that looks like a thing you can write on it's even got like a mechanically feeling buttons on it that's not a terrible little volume switch thing and then on the back it's just got some little feet and texture so that it sits on the table nicely oh Carter looks like a pen now the writing utensil is like a click button on the side and then we've got the tip with its obscene amounts of pressures that it can read and then it feels quite nice as well it's got like a like a rubberized matte finish to it and even this feels quite nice I am excited to try this out I may actually try and play a game with this peripheral life I think playing some GTA 5 with a pen should be awesome although aside from gaming on it I'm not entirely sure why Vic thought I was the correct person to test one of these considering that I've never used one before but at least I am very good at drawing so I'm sure we'll be able to figure something out yeah okay let's move on to the next thing [Music] oh we've got some beats gear oh there's two of them I have no idea what this is uh it is Android and Windows compatible apparently and then the model color is cardboard colored so that is exciting [Music] it it is actually cardboard colored it seems just going by the box I would I was joking about that but it seems to be accurate I'm assuming this is what you use to carry your Beats gear around Hmm this branding does make my Spidey Sense tingle somewhat we also get a power supply for our Beats by gear in the box we have an extension for the power supply so that we can move the Beats gear a bit further away no way that is a cigarette lighter power supply so that you can do some my gear while driving which seems dangerous and in this I think it's like a sound card maybe because we've got a USBC port on the back and then an AUX port on the other side and then we get an aux cable along with it and it also tells us to very carefully read the instructions before doing some beats gear but before we read that let's have a quick look at it I think this is oh what it looks like a pillow it's like a seat cushion on the side we've got some IO for it I then checked the second box for Clues as to what the Beats gear was for so this one is black as opposed to the like prosthetic limb color of the other one and despite spending a while examining it I couldn't figure out what it was for I'm gonna have to read the instructions I am gonna sit on it while I read the instructions because I assume I mean it's quite comfortable I'm not I'm not gonna lie I don't know if this is its intended use case but it works well as a cushion and after spending some time in the manual I eventually figured it out so like I'm guessing it'll make your butt vibrate the explosions and stuff okay I am actually quite excited to try the Beats By gear maybe it's supposed to be by my lower back and not under my butt but we'll we'll figure it out uh so with that let's get to the actual using of the things now I guess we're starting off with the high dock which I'm going to be plugging into an Asus laptop that ironically has a very good I O so it doesn't actually need the high dock but just imagine this is like a dongle book or whatever and then we're just going to plug some normal house stuff into it like a keyboard a mouse and a monitor I did want to plug ethernet into it but it doesn't have an ethernet port for some reason now as far as I understand it's main gimmick is that it's like a at home boardroom phone replacement thing which again kind of confuses me as to why they thought I should test it considering that I've never been in a boardroom before and I'm sure I'd probably spontaneously combust of boredom in one now there is another USB C Port that's PD so I think you can plug it into the wall and then it'll charge your laptop and stuff as well oh it's lit up in green hey it has just done the thing um now what this am I done testing it I then decided to check out its Kickstarter Campaign which was filled with pictures of people doing generic business things near it but then they explain how one of the problems that it solves is fomo fomo from what being in a boardroom because it's definitely not helping with ethernet fomo anyway I then decided to test out the speaker I have versions of songs I use in videos a lot with vocals you know because they keep talking about its vocal quality and after spending a while listening to various songs on it I came to the conclusion that it sounded like a dongle speaker it sounds exactly how you would imagine a thing like this to sound it's kind of uncanny I will say it does go uncomfortably loud so this is me talking uh it is now arm's length for Me Maybe This is the distance people stand from a conference phone I have no idea and then when I walk across from the room now I'm about three meters away from it and uh I'm gonna I'm gonna speak at like a normal speaking voice for me which is still quite loud but um yes I then decided to be very professional and test the USB 3 throughput on it using Crystal disk Mark and an external m.2 drive with the drive plugged straight into the USBC port on the laptop I got this result but then when I put the Hub in the chain we lost some serious throughput wow that has really dumpstered the performance so just redid the test swapping out the USB cable plugging in the external drive and we're getting the same result so the performance brutalization is the hobb's fault but it's not that bad you know it's just a 10 Factor reduction in performance of throughput that's already much slower than what the drives capable of next we're going to try the weak which again I am very much not the correct person to test one of these but I guess we'll just plug it in and see what happens okay a couple of lights flashed up there I feel like it's confused because when I go from left to right it goes up and down and when I go up and down it goes from left and right I then spent a while trying to figure out how to invert the inputs because of the logo on the bass it made me feel like this had to be the correct orientation to use it but eventually I just gave up and turned the thing around whoa this has quite the learning curve to it it feels kind of like I'm doing physical therapy I think the reason it feels so unnatural is because my writing input is down here and then the output is physically separate over here it's got quite a nice papery texture to it so it feels like you're writing I then downloaded the weak drivers and some drawing software that Google told me was good so that I could Flex my drawing skills okay so now that I've drawn a beautiful flower let's try and game with it um I have never seen that happen before let's see if we let's try changing Mouse input method to Windows no that has that is not helped hahaha that has not helped at all maybe direct input that is actually kind of working and after fine-tuning some sensitivity and smoothing settings we were in business oh I can actually drive with it if I like press down I can use it to steer look at that that is amazing it is working better than I was expecting if I'm oh going straight is very hard though once you've started turning you know you wanted to like make a big turn it is very hard to straighten out oh the motorbike is not oh because you have to lift it quite far off no down oh this is very this is exceedingly treacherous oh no okay let's try an FPS and see if we can actually Pawn some noobs with it [Music] if we can get a kill with the weak then it'll get a positive review I guess is how that works how do I look yeah how do I look behind me okay so I guess I'm going down this road I don't really have much of a choice so I use the button on the pen to aim down my sights and then I push it down to shoot okay anyway what I was saying is it kind of lulls you into a false sense of security because it feels quite accurate but when you're actually having to like aim and shoot it feels really clumsy I can't I I can't go I can't look up there oh okay this is not a very good gaming peripheral you only have this plane of movement so where you can look is very dependent on the direction you're facing when you spawn so I need to wait for this guy to be facing the most useful Direction possible before I spawn on him I'm in hope that for the rest of my life this is the correct orientation but after some trial and error it actually happened oh I got a kill that is huge I mean I think this is gonna become my new FPS peripheral from now on some amazing stuff weak now when it comes to the time Kettle translation earbuds I had no idea how to test them properly and I couldn't just do like a fake gaming test with them either so I decided to start with some basic phrases in a language I once heard so basically the mode that it's in now is that it translates what we're saying into Japanese and just to clarify there's a voice in the ear about reading the translation Anna's also got one in she's off camera my name is David this like it it you know they defeated this uh let's try my favorite Japanese saying do you get naked for this exact way I know that phrase but there is some hadakonni in in there so I you know I I guess it works I then decided to switch things up and have it translate my very broken Japanese into English my name is Dave okay get naked question mark um Anna then very smartly suggested that we listen to a Korean drama on YouTube and have it translate that which went very well oh no it's not working it's not working at all I'm not a mother who caught penetration unconditionally in all fairness I don't know how reasonable translating movie dialogue playing back over a speaker is and Google translate also struggled with it even if it was in a much less hilarious way no it's also not like the Naboo article must have ordered natural paint so are they good well I'm not really sure although their Amazon reviews aren't particularly positive neither are the reviews of the app and the fact that you can't use them as like normal earbuds for listening to movies and watching music with is shocking for a 320 product and from my perspective I'm not particularly sure how much more it offers than Google translate which is free but what do I know [Music] next we're trying out the Beats gear which I spent quite some time reading the manual and I'm still not entirely sure if you're supposed to sit on it or use it as like a lower back support so we're gonna try both now we're going to start off by sitting on it which um on the IKEA chair that I'm using with it it means that you sit very high and it kind of ruins the um the ergonomics of the chair a bit now for Windows you don't need any additional wires other than the power cable because it can connect via Bluetooth but you do need to download some software for it and after installing the slightly fiddly drivers the Beats gear made quite the introduction Ah Holy sh that scared me it's just out of nowhere I mean that's quite the vibration I beat power 100 oh I need to turn the beat oh yes when you touch the slider it does things to you and those things continue to happen while gaming ah I need to turn it down and once I found the appropriate beat power I had to dial in the latency so that the vibrations happened at the same time as in-game sounds okay there's definitely a latency issue uh so luckily they do account for that in the drivers but while struggling to dial in the beat latency another problem reared its head sometimes you bump a thing and it vibrates and then sometimes you bump a thing and it doesn't vibrate it seems quite inconsistent with with its vibrations yeah like there sometimes you hit a bump in the road and it vibrates and then you like just wreck a curb and it doesn't I was also starting to realize that maybe it wasn't meant to be sat on it is borderline arousing and I think that it being borderline arousing is kind of a problem right because I'm trying to game not get off right so it it doing what it's doing okay maybe I'm not supposed to sit on it maybe that's the problem because there's it sends vibrations all through your undercarriage which I'm sure none of you tuned into this video expecting me to talk about my undercarriage but there is lots of undercarriage action happening so I'm gonna have to to move it over it doesn't make sense when it's on your lower back either because it's not contoured so now it just feels like I've got a pillow wedged behind me and not one of those ergonomic lower back pillows just a slab of thing so with it here with it against your lower back it's less arousing so it actually makes more sense I mean I guess it depends on what you want from the thing but aside from being less arousing from behind the vibrations still felt too random it doesn't feel immersive it just feels like there's a kid sitting behind you kicking the chair randomly I then decided to try listening to some music with the Beats By gear in beat mode but if anything music with a very consistent Tempo brought the lack of coherency into clearer Focus even with the latency synced and the Beats By gear set to beat mode it wasn't consistently keeping the tempo which just made it feel like random vibration I spent a good couple of hours playing around with the drivers but couldn't get it to feel like anything more than just somebody practicing their dropkicks against the back of my chair which I think brings me to the end of a pretty pointless video although if you enjoyed it subscribe to the channel and maybe watch another video a suggestion will pop up in a second and until the next video bye-bye foreign [Music]",

    "transcript": "I very rarely accept pre-builts from companies for videos but when MSI reached out to me out of the blue offering to send over this Beast standing next to me I just couldn't say no for a couple of reasons the first one is considering my history with MSI prebuilts oh that's not good oh no I killed it I guess I guess one wasn't that bad probably not gonna poison your drinking water I think it's hilarious that MSI thought it was a good idea to send a system to me and the second reason is MSI took some of the most powerful Hardware in the world and stuffed it into a case that looks like this and I just can't see a way in which that does not end terribly [Music] thank you I wonder what kind of E-Waste peripherals the system this fancy comes with it's oh although in all fairness MSI prebuilts do usually come with some Primo e-waste we've got some nice raised cool marketing on the box [Music] and in this box we get a power cable a 16 pin power adapter for NVIDIA graphics card some case mounting crap and a big cleaning cloth for them fingerprints but no E-Waste peripherals it's very heavy [Music] this is very well packaged so your game unlimited system should survive even the most negligent delivery person [Music] thank you I see why they gave you the microfiber cloth with it okay I really hope this system was reviewed by someone before me because if this is the state they come out of the factory in that is not a good sign because I couldn't have soiled it that hard just unboxing it right and while I was trying and failing to wipe all of the mysterious grease off it I couldn't help but notice some shocking build quality oh it's put together like a Tesla what the hell aside from none of the panels fitting together correctly the material choices were much less high-end gaming system and More Dollar Store Lego plastic look at that and aside from the Fisher Price build quality I'm just not sold on the way it looks I don't know the aesthetic to me kind of looks like something that was the result of the vivisection of several different pieces and they just like glued the resulting bits together on the front we've got this control panel thing which is like a touch screen which lets you do things next to that is what looks like a strip of Illumination we have what looks like more functional front ventilation in front of this pretty big ventilated panel over the side of the system and it looks reasonably porous so I don't know maybe I overreacted maybe temperatures will be fine and then on top of the system next to this very cool branding we have even more ventilation oh and in terms of front i o it's pretty good and you know what they say there's nothing classier than super low quality piano black plastic around the back we've got the standard pre-built small exhaust fan above which is a very exciting graphics card which we'll talk about out in a second and finally on the back in terms of rear i o it's pretty anemic for a system in this weight class now in terms of ventilation this case looks better than I was expecting from the pictures but then you remember that there is an I9 3900 KF in here and an RTX 4090 which results in a combined potential TDP of 700 Watts so yeah I don't know I think we're gonna have to open it up and have a look at the cooling solution in here oh yeah that comes off very easily and then under that wow there is some serious cooling under there never mind and this side panel seems very porous like we can see the case through it but the build quality on it is unsettlingly alienwarey look at that but putting that aside in here we have some serious Hardware up here is our RTX 4090 which I can't wait to see how this performs and it's a 4090 with a decent cooler on it as far as I understand this is the Ventus 3 version of it which also has this Silent Storm cooling thing attached to the top which we'll have a closer look at in a second on the side we've got a 280 mil radiator for the CPU which is a pretty chunky boy below that is some MSI power supply which again will have a closer look at later on next to which is a mechanical Drive which is quite funny to see on a system this fancy oh that like slides open cool okay that is a concerningly soft plastic radiator Mount and the interior is very OEM gray it's also a real Bare Bones looking motherboard in here it does have dual Channel Ram but for almost five thousand dollars it doesn't get any points for that especially considering it looks like Ram they dug out of a boom somewhere power supply wise we have a thousand watt standard ATX MSI unit which should be enough for the system foreign they did really take a page out of alienware's book and just glue a bunch of plastic crap to the outside of an office PC case [Music] oh that's a bit disappointing apparently the Silent Storm cooling thing is just a doctor that funnels air into the 4090. I don't know I was kind of expecting something a bit more high-tech than just a bit of plastic okay so with that let's reassemble the plastic fantastic and see what kind of temperatures we get while gaming which I am really excited to see oh yeah MSI also sent over this monitor with the system for some reason so we're going to use it to test the system with [Music] come on oh the screen is flashing a dragon at me oh they're clearly very proud of the design of the thing because the background also has it on I'm not sure if I want to see it twice um but you know at least the wallpaper version does look like it's insignificantly better condition oh Norton yeah we'll look at VD in a second oh here is our 13 900 KF and this is our 64 gigs of RAM which is running at its base frequency so they didn't set it at the rated speed of the ram which is a bit of a shame but we'll test the performance impact of that later in the video when it comes to the venereal bloatware situation the system was pretty good aside from Norton there wasn't a whole lot on there there is the standard MSI control center thing that wants you to download more crap but other than that it's pretty clean now that we've fired up the system I do quickly want to look at the functionality of the screen which you can see I've barely touched and it's already disgusting this is the kind of stuff that you can do with it shortcut for example lets you launch software on your desktop from here and as you can see it's very very responsive there's also a gaming mode which as far as I can tell doesn't do anything although I think you can set up gaming profiles in the MSI software for it oh yeah and you can also set your RGB to different colors with it very useful um so yeah let's play some games on it [Music] now I'm starting off with GTA 5 purely out of habit and at 4K very high settings we are pegged at about 190 frames per second which is the point as you can see where GTA 5 starts to descend into a stutter Fest so GTA 5 is basically unplayable because of well it running too well [Music] so now with Battlefield 5 we are running at 4K Ultra settings and we're occasionally bumping off the frame rate limiter so let me quickly deal with that so we've uncapped our frame rate and we're almost at 300 frames per second and 4K Ultra settings so that is pretty wild temperature wise I'm kind of gonna have to eat my words from the beginning of the video because considering what's happening here they are very good the ambient temperature in the room is 16 degrees Celsius so that helps but it's barely breaking a sweat here but it's only been a short period of time so let's game for a while and then I'll get back to you on the temperatures so I've been playing for about 45 minutes now and temperature wise I'm actually really impressed with the system it is Audible you know you can hear it but in this 16 degree celsius room we are getting very reasonable temperatures and in terms of performance it's crazy this 40 90 runs Battlefield 5 at 4K Ultra settings like its 1080p medium next up we have cyberpunk running at 4K Ultra settings and this is where things start to get a little tough because we're not quite consistently sitting at 60 frames per second and bear in mind this is without Ray tracing on the system is quite noisy but for this kind of like OEM pre-built in the form factor it's not nearly as noisy as you would expect and considering that all of the ventilation is on oh oh terrible things are happening uh considering that all of the ventilation is on the other side of the case if you have the system on your right hand side it kind of blows the noise in that direction so having said that let's move over to some Ray tracing action Ultra so that's the same settings that we have for everything else 40 frames per second wow cyberpunk does not mess about especially at 4K let's set it up to Psycho and see what that does it's pretty crazy to see a five thousand dollar system brought to its knees like this but there's another way around it we can use some of this whoa that's made a huge difference turning quality dlss on we have gotten like three times the frame rate pretty much that we got before and considering that it's DLS S4 4K and we're actually using a 1440p panel here you can't really notice the dlss is on anyway enough screwing around with cyberpunk let's set the ram to its rated speed and see how much that helps the performance now in terms of BIOS this is an MSI system and they do motherboards so we actually get a usable looking bios useful looking but it turns out it's one of the most useless bioses on any MSI system I've looked at so far how does that make any sense it does have some pretend overclocking features but I couldn't set the XMP profiles for the ram so it was stuck with the base ddr5 speed at least you can turn on rebar which was off by default so there's that so at the end of the day temperature wise the system was a whole lot better than I was expecting it really could have been a dumpster fire and it wasn't and it also performs like a roided up Olympian but it cost five thousand dollars and has a 40 90 in it obviously it does and I just can't get past the fact that the build quality would be unacceptable on a system costing a fifth of the price if I pay five thousand dollars for a PC it better be hewned from mithril not just made from a wafer tin with a bunch of plastic crap glued to it anyway with that thank you MSI for sending over the system and um yeah with that it brings me to the end of the video thank you for watching and until the next one bye [Music] thank you [Music]",

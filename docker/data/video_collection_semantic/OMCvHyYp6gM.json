But on the inside both are equipped with a new S9 SiP (System in Package) and a new ultra wideband chip. The Series 9 also offers a double-tap feature that lets you tap your index finger and thumb together to do things like answer a phone call.

    "transcript": "(upbeat music) - So we just saw the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 and not much has changed, at least on the outside. On the outside they're pretty much the same watches as before. You know, I had my Ultra right next to the Ultra 2 and I could not tell you what the difference was. I actually almost left this on the table. So that's what we're working with here. The Series 9, there's a new pink version. We love pink Barbie's out, love the new pink watch, but on the inside there is a new processor, the S9 sip. This is the first major processor upgrade that we're pretty much seeing since this Series 6 and that's supposed to do a whole lot of things. Basically it's making things faster. Series should be able to understand you a lot better. There's also going to be a lot more power efficiency, which means the screens can be brighter. The Series 9 is going to be 2,000 knits and the Ultra 2 goes up to 3,000 knits, which should theoretically mean that if you're out in super direct sunlight, you should be able to read everything a lot easier. We are obviously indoors with a lot of natural soft lighting, so it was really hard for us to see that. We're gonna have to go out and test that for ourselves. Power efficiency also supposedly translates to better battery life kind of. The estimates are the same, 18 hours for the Series 9 and 36 for the Ultra 2. But again, we'll see how it fares in testing. There is a handy double tap feature, but it's not really new, new. If you've used assistive touch before, you kind of already know how to use that. However, right now it's going to be built into the system so it's gonna be a lot more contextual and handle all the primary app functions for you. So let's say you wanna go through the widget stack. All you do is do this, do a little tap motion and you'll be able to scroll through your widgets. If you have your camera, you should be able to do that and it'll handle your shutter. You can start and end timers with them, start and end calls with them. Great. Basically, it's gonna be a lot easier to do things with one hand or hands free. So you know, washing your dishes you can end a call like that. We love to see it. Other than that, there's really not a whole lot that's different. Even the prices are the same. The Series 9 starts at $399 while the Ultra 2 is gonna start at $799 and they'll be available starting September 22nd. Did I forget anything? No, I think that's all that's new. Guys, I'm so sorry, but I forgot to tell you that it also has a new U2 ultra wide band chip, so that's not the only new thing. So you'll be able to use it for better precision finding, which if like me that means you can finally find your phone when you leave it in the freezer and or fridge, things I have done multiple times.",

    "description": "The Lenovo Smart Display is an inexpensive but highly useful piece of tech for students and back to school. Available Here -   Running the Google Assistant, the 8\" or 10\" Displays have great speakers and can be used for webcamming, showing photos, watching videos,  schedules, making reminders, setting alarms. There is so much stuff that can be done on this 200 dollar device.

    "transcript": "GET OVER HERE! Hey, how's it going? Dave 2D here. This right here is what I would consider Google's best accessory for students. It's essentially a speaker with a screen. It's nothing new we've seen that before but, what makes this thing special is the Google Assistant that's running on this whole device and... how it integrates everything with your Google Apps and stuff like that. But the best feature about this product is it's price, and that's basically why I even made this video. This thing goes for $200 dollars and it's not cheap, but for what you're getting and what you can do with this thing, I think it's a steal. Now there's 2 versions of this. There's an '8 version and a '10 version. Which is quite a bit bigger and the big difference between the two is the screen size obviously. The '10 version is higher 'res' and has slightly bigger speakers. But it goes for $250, this one goes for $200 I think at Costco you can actually get the '10 version for $200 as well. But even if they were the same price, if they were both the exact same price, I would personally 'opt' for the '8 version. I like the smaller form factor and I don't find that the screen resolution is that different. Like visually they look quite similar to me. Now I'm gonna talk about the speaker. there's gonna be audio-philes out there that just hate the way this thing sounds but I actually think they sound quite good at least better than I thought they would and better than they thought they should considering their price as decent body not a ton of bass but it'll comfortably fill your room with music and it connects us stuff like google music YouTube music Spotify all your regular stuff for Google home devices to connects you the other thing this thing features is a screen now this screen is what differentiates this product from stuff like the Google home speaker or the Google home acts or basically any kind of smart speaker having a screen like this brings another layer of functionality if you consider its price like 200 bucks you can buy a Google home for 120 bucks this is $80 horan brings so much more to the table so you can use it for google assistant stuff like asking for weather or traffic or unit conversions setting your schedule for alarms or timers setting reminders the utility for students is endless on this thing and if you're not using it for any of those Google services you can just have it on your table as a clock and it looks pretty good and having as a music player with good speakers there's just so much going on for it now you can also play videos on it the truth is I don't love it as a video player like if you know exactly what you want to watch on YouTube it's good for that but it's not great for discovery and it's also difficult to navigate around in YouTube through the voice interface the ads for this product from Lenovo showcase a lot of people using it for recipes and stuff like video recipes I'm not someone that does that very often so I can't really comment on that but just in terms of video consumption just like watching videos it's pretty good for that as well the webcam features I don't really like them so the weird thing is that they're touting this thing as like being great for a webcaming and you can put it into a vertical position the idea is cool but I personally prefer using my phone for that there's something about having a static location and a static angle for that webcaming that isn't great for me personally it does have this physical slider for the camera that you can use to cover it up for privacy reasons which is kind of cool but the overall product is really really useful for the price like 200 bucks isn't pocket change but you get a lot of utility on this thing your speaker get a screen video player all the good stuff that comes with Google assistance put it this way I have access to the home pod the Google home acts a regular Google home and I've put all of those away in exchange for the 8 inch Lenovo smart display it's just so much nicer to be able to interact with your Google assistant with a visual representation of what you're interacting with it makes a big difference in terms of utility and I think for students it's something that can can make a big difference in how you kind of go through your school day ok hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time you",

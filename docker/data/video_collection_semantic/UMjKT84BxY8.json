Menu:  Affinity Symbols: 0:12 Cloud Symbols: 2:10 Version 2.3 and long term plans: 5:05  #gns3 #gns3vm #gns3tutorial",

    "transcript": "(halting electro music) - So Jeremy, another feature that a lot of people like I know in GNS3 version 2.2 and later is these pretty symbols. - Yes, affinity symbols as we call them. - So what is that about? - This is a contribution from one of our users. They're basically pretty icons, pretty symbols for your GSN3 projects. - So this is a great example for everyone who's watching. The great thing about GSN3 and the community is you can contribute and make a change so I can't remember the guy's name who did it but someone contributed symbols on GitHub and now everyone can benefit from that because he made it open source, didn't he? - Yes. - So anyone can use that. So now that's been integrated into-- - Into version 2.2, from full version 2.2. - And later, great. So I'll probably show you that in a separate video 'cause it's easier to demonstrate it but just in brief, you can right-click on a device? - Yes. - In your workspace? And then you can change the symbol-- - You can change the symbol. You will see the affinity symbol there. - So it's built right in? - Yes, it's built in. - You can also do it when you do templates, yeah? - You can also do it when you do templates. - When you import a new template. - Yes, when you create a new template you import an appliance file and it will, depending on what you choose in the preference, it will include the affinity symbol. - And you can change the symbols on the left hand side. You can change the symbols of the devices that you've already got. - Yeah, on places you've already created. - Okay, so there's like three places where you can do it. - Yes. - Okay, great. All right, so that's a great change. I'm just looking through our list here. Another one that I really like is cloud consoles. So what is that about? - So cloud console, so you can take a cloud node and map it to a physical device you have anywhere in your network and on Internet. - So if I've got GSN3 running, let's say on my PC here and I'm connected to a physical network so I've got a switch, let's say switch one and here I've got router one and I'll just draw really bad topology but let's say I've got a bunch of routers here. You're saying that I can build a GSN3 toplogy here with cloud nodes. - Yes. - It has to be a cloud node, yeah? - It has to be a cloud node but you can change the symbol, you can customize it. - So basically, I could draw a topology of my physical network-- - Yes. - In GSN3, change the symbol to router switch, whatever I want and then when I click on that, like I would-- - It will open a console. - So it'll open up a console from my PC using let's say Telnet or SSH or something. - It can be Telnet, or it can be http, so web. It can be a VNC. - VNC, so I could go to a physical server here somewhere. - Yes. - And they would do a VNC to that, yeah? - Yup. - And I could be https? - It could be https as well. - And like SSH, yeah? - SSH, I don't think we support it yet but that's a good idea to include. - Do it for later, yeah? - Yes. - The great advantage here is that you can have both GSN3 virtual devices, so you could have an IOSv device here. - Connected to your cloud. - To connect it to the cloud. - Which will present-- - Or in that Or in that device. - Yes. - So like NAT or something To the physical network and sorry, you were saying? - And yes, you can connect it to your cloud and your cloud can represent any physical device. - This is not the official line, this is just me, as an analogy, I like to say this is the Visio replacement kind of thing. - Yes, it's like a simple Visio where you can create a network. - It's funny because a lot of people have asked me, David, how do you draw your topologies and I actually used GSN3 for a lot of my topologies because with the affinity symbols, the new symbols and the fact that, I don't know if people are aware of this, you can snap devices to the grid in GSN3? - Yeah, we have a grid support. - So you can have a grid in GSN3 and you can snap the devices to the grid and get them all aligned very nicely, so as you move it, it snaps to the grid and when you're ready, there's an option where you can un-snap from the grid but they're all aligned nicely but this takes it a step further where I can actually click on the devices and access physical devices on my network, is that right? - From GSN3, yes. - Directly from within GSN3, so both virtual devices or physical devices on my network can all be linked in a pretty network diagram but also it's a live diagram-- - Yes. - Where you can connect directly to devices, yeah? - Yup. - Brilliant. Okay, so let's go to the next one. What about 2.3 or later. What are your plans for the future? - So long-term plans, first one will be how to deploy gen 3 in the cloud. any cloud provider, could be Google Cloud, could be Azure, could be packet.net. So how do we create multiple server, each have GSN3 server process running in it. So how do we make this easier for our users? - Okay, so that's not GSN3 hosting the VM for users, is it? It's just making it easier to deploy in a cloud provider. - Yes, it's up to our users to provide their account or subscriptions for providers. We just provide a way to deploy GSN3 in the cloud environment. - Do you have to run like a script or something? - Like a script or something. - Okay, great. What other things have you got on the roadmap? - So we want to add a user management layer. - So that's like permissions, is it? - Like permissions, like also resource limitations-- - That's a big one. - How much memory or how much cpu a user can use from a GSN3 server. - Okay, so at the moment, in GSN3, I can have a GSN3 VM and I could be sharing a topology with someone. - Yup. So whatever I update, they can see. But this takes it a step further, because if I started up 50 nodes, it would consume all the cpu perhaps and all the memory of the GSN3 server running in an ESXi server or something. - Then they have no more resources to run their projects. - But the idea long-term is that, let's say I was an instructor with a class, could say every student only gets 10% or whatever I decide. - Like yes, 10%, that much cpu power, yes. - Memory, that kind of thing? - Yup. - This is, once again, on the roadmap. This is not here, this is what you're planning to do. - Yes. - So again, depending on when you're watching this, this may be available or not. We're recording this in August 2019 but this is more long term, yeah? - Yup. - Okay Jeremy, so that's the long term plans - Yeah. - So hopefully we'll see that coming but if anyone wants to give suggestions of things that could be improved in GSN3 what should they do? - They should go on the gsn3.com website on the community section and then they can post their ideas there. - Like in the forum type area. - Like the forum, yes. - And then they can just post ideas there and you'll see that and then that could be put on a list that you decide, yeah? - Yup. - Great.

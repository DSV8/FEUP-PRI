    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine. And today we are testing out the new iOS 14 feature, the satellite SOS. Now I've got this phone here and as you can tell I am out in the middle of nowhere, can't hear any cars. You just hear nature and there's no cell reception. And let me tell you what just happened. Oops. I have sprained my ankle. I'm gonna show you guys how this worked but I also got a chance to chat with some Apple executives all about the new features and how this all came to be. How does this actually work and how is this gonna benefit people? - Sure. Well, I'll start and Arun feel free to chime in. As you know when you need help you need help wherever you are. And with the emergency SOS via satellite capability we created this groundbreaking service on all iPhone 14 models to allow the iPhone that you have with you in your pocket all the time to connect directly to a satellite and get you help when you're off the grid. Now of course, the satellite connectivity was a key part of this and we saw that as important to allow Apple to expand our offerings as far as safety features. Now, satellite connectivity is important because even though ground seller connectivity has improved over the years, there's still some places such as national parks or winding roads where cell towers don't quite reach yet. And maybe in most cases these limitations are okay but when there's an emergency, that can be a problem. And so we work to bring this capability to the iPhone 14 models that you have with you all the time. - So now we're back here. My friends in the middle of nowhere, my ankle was sprained. I'm bleeding out, I don't know what to do. I'm gonna call 911. So as you can see up here, no cell reception. Okay, we're gonna dial 911. I need help. And I obviously don't have any cell reception but it's still attempting, calling, oh no reception. So now we're automatically connected via satellite. So we're gonna click right here and this will bring up the emergency SOS via satellite. So this is gonna walk us through how to actually do this. So we're gonna report an emergency. Your location and medical ID may be shared. Here's the emergency. Oh my ankle putting so much pain. Here we go. Sickness or injury? Multiple people. Everyone's injured. Yes, I am here at the location. How are they breathing? Feels pretty good. Okay. Yeah, I'm, breathing pretty normally. Are they conscious? Somewhat. Best describes? Oh, traumatic. Super traumatic. This is something that I think is really incredible if you have your emergency contact set up which I believe everyone should do. So if you don't, make sure you go check and make sure you have those set up. They'll actually be able to get a transcript of this conversation as it's happening in real time. So we're gonna notify I hope Karina cares about my wellbeing. Here it is. So this is where it actually is tracking the satellites. Now as you can see this will value to open up your messages. So this is the messages and here is our satellite connection and we need to get connected. So right now, before connection, and this is telling me where the satellite actually is in space. So we're gonna try to find that satellite, we're locked on. So keep pointing at satellite to send and receive. So we are now connected. So I'm gonna go back to my messages. One of the really cool things that Apple has done is they've made it so that all of these messages are super compressed because it takes a lot of time to send data up and down from these satellites. So right now I've received response back and still connected. I've reached the emergency relay center. Describe the location. There are lots of rocks and a big tree. Again, these things do take time 'cause you're sending this all the way up to the sky. I'm so injured. Help! Oh, I gotta stay connected. Uh oh, my satellites are moving. The really cool thing is I can still be in my iMessage and see the satellite connection up here at the top. Okay, I'm reaching out to an emergency service now. Do they have any medication available? No. Please bring, bring bandaids. I am bleeding. Local responders have been notified at this point since the local responders have been notified. I'm clear to hit end and I can end this section. And I still have the option to call emergency services or text emergency services. And we also have a demo phone to see what the other side of the conversation looks like. For my emergency contacts this is exactly everything that I said. How are they breathing? Are they conscious? And it also sends the location. Please bring medication. I said bring band-aids. I'm bleeding. I can't stop laughing. I'm sorry it's not, this is not funny at all but I'm just laughing at my poor scenario here. Bring bandaid, I'm bleeding. If there's medical responders they're probably gonna have way more than band-aids. This again is my friend's phone. So all of my emergency contacts will be notified and be getting all of this information up to date. Now this is a demo. So this is all set up and this is actually what it would look like if you are in this scenario. And since I am at Apple, this is set up and we're not actually talking to the responders. So this is all kind of a fake demo setup. But what's really cool is for everyone at home there is a demo in here. So you can actually test this out to see what it's like. So you're into settings, emergency SOS and scroll all the way to the bottom. And right here it says iPhone can help start satellite connection, try the demo. So this is exactly what you'll see. So make sure you obviously are going outside because this is not gonna work indoors. So you do need to have clear access to the sky answering emergency questions. And we're gonna test our satellite connection. Now during this your cellular service is going to be disconnected so we're gonna turn that off so you can get an actual demo of what this is like. I'm just so out here in nature, I just can't believe it. There's no buildings anywhere. This is clearly is saying this is an emergency demo. This is obviously not a real emergency but this is giving you that entire thing that I just showed you and what it would be like. It's not, not about you guys but I absolutely love Find My I have it on for a bunch of my friends, all of my family and it's really fun just to be able to check up. And I know, especially my parents love it because they don't have to ask where I'm at. They literally can go into Find My and see where I am. Now this is gonna be super helpful for hikes or when you're traveling and you're in a place where you may not have cell reception Find My also will work. So you're able to basically force your location using satellite when there isn't any service. We're gonna go to me and as we scroll down here you'll see that this location was last set by satellite at 4:18 pm. And so I'm gonna send it right now. Send location via satellites. Here we go. We're trying to get a clear view of the sky. We're looking for the satellite. You have to stand like this too. It's the official satellite stance. You don't actually understand like this. Let's see where I am. Oh, I'm right by Apple Park. I hope someone can find me. Send help. Thank you guys so much for watching. I hope you guys enjoyed this little demo of the new satellite on the iPhone 14. I'm super excited about this and I think it's gonna help out so many people. Do you guys have any questions? Feel free to leave them in the comments below. And I look forward to hearing what you guys think about this. I'll see you guys out there. (tranquil music) See you later. Oh my ankle's magically healed now. (tranquil upbeat music)",

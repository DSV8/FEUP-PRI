    "transcript": "- I don't wanna spoil today's episode, but here's a hint. It's got something to do with tech news. (laughs) (people cheering rowdily) We're gonna start off with something other than Apple and Epic, for once, and that's Uber and Lyft. On Monday, the two ride-sharing companies were officially ordered by a California judge to reclassify their drivers as employees, rather than independent contractors. Uber and Lyft both said they'd have to suspend operations as a result, because they couldn't just adapt their infrastructure within the 10-day limit allocated by the order. But an appeals court ruling has since allowed the companies to keep operating. - Wow. - The skirmish comes after years of debate over whether ride-sharing startups can legally treat their drivers as contractors, when many of them feel they're employees by another name. And the story comes just as Uber's former security chief is being charged with obstruction of justice for hiding the company's 2016 security breach from the FTC. If you're angry about all this, and you just wanna do something, you could boycott Uber. I'm sure that's much easier than normal right now, so... Okay, but now I guess we are going back to Apple and Epic. News publishers are now joining the row over the App Store's 30% cut. Trade organization Digital Content Next, which represents dozens of publishers, including the Washington Post and The New York Times, has written an open letter, essentially asking Apple, \"Hey, what's the deal, man?\" With the specific deal in question being the smaller 15% cut that Apple asks of Amazon's Prime Video. Fortnite is still on the offensive as well, holding the #FreeFortnite tourmanent, tourmanent? It's a tournament, this weekend, tournament! Offering prizes such as the evil apple-headed tyrant from the 1984 parody video and a free Fortnite hat, like a physical hat. But Apple has also taken action, filing a declaration essentially accusing Epic of fabricating this whole scandal, which it totally did, to be fair. Apple revealed emails from Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, asking Apple to exempt Fortnite from the 30% cut before the whole thing started. Pretty weasely moves, but again, here's your daily reminder that it's okay to hate both Apple and Epic in this situation. In fact, if you do, that means you're really smart. Rick Sanchez would be proud. And back to our other favorite topic recently, TikTok! The social app announced that it deleted more than 380,000 videos and banned around 1,300 accounts this year for violating the platform's hate speech rules, which I'm sure they would have done if they weren't under threat of being banned in the US. We'll never know. It also recently came out that Google parent company Alphabet considered bidding for an acquisition of TikTok, but ultimately decided against it. Being acquired by either Microsoft or Oracle looks to be TikTok's way out of the ban, but even if neither of those deals goes through, TikTok says they will continue operating in the country with a company executive saying that they have \"multiple paths forward\" to keep running. I mean, I guess that's what I would say, too. It's good to know that no matter what happens, weebs will still be able to recreate anime dances, because if you can't do that, are you really living? Is this even a free country? Now it's time for the Quick Bits, brought to you by privacy, just straight-up, abstract concept privacy. Just joking, it's the free service that allows you to generate virtual credit cards for online purchases and subscriptions. By generating virtual credit cards with limits that you can set, and no other personal information, you can now sign up for sites that you wanted to try, but just looked a little too sketchy for your comfort level. And you'll even get 1% cash back for upgrading to their Pro version. So sign up at privacy.com/techlinked to get $5 off your first purchase today. When life gets you down, take a long drag on a Quick Bit. (inhales loudly) Yeah, that's smooth. Look at this leaked photo of the GeForce RTX 3090 next to an RTX 2080, it's huge! Not only is it a triple-slot instead of a double-slot card, but it's also way taller and beefier in general. So if chonkiness is any indicator of the performance, then this thing is gonna fly through games like a chungus through jelly, it's a chonky boy! Okay, now look at these renders of the Google Pixel 5, created by OnLeaks and Indian tech site PriceBaba. Based on the information that's leaked so far, it basically looks like a Pixel 4a, but with a sparkly-looking texture and dual rear cameras, instead of just one. But if you like getting overly excited for things that will probably end up being just okay, (laughs) then, hey, eat your heart out. Okay, fine, that's not fair. Sparkles are pretty cool. Sony has revealed some more info about the PS5 controller's extra features, saying that it'll be able to do things like lock the triggers in place when your gun jams in game. That's actually pretty sick, experiencing not just virtual, but physical frustration from what sounds like an irritating game mechanic, I can't help but be excited. (person giggling) Hopefully the PS6 controller will be able to teabag me after I get poned, too. (person laughing) (loudly imitates licking)(giggles) 505 Games, the publisher of the highly-acclaimed Control, has attempted to explain why it had to limit free next-gen upgrades to the Ultimate Edition of that title. Its justification, that it couldn't let players upgrade from the non-Ultimate Edition to the Ultimate Edition because they're technically separate titles. And to do that would be to compromise the very structure of reality itself. No way to just, like... Sorry, their hands are tied. And a fighter jet AI built by Heron Systems just beat a human pilot 5-nothing in DARPA's AlphaDogfight trials, after it defeated at least seven other AI systems. And I don't know how many times we've said this on this channel, but I'll say it again, \"Stealth,\" watch the movie \"Stealth.\" Riley must've written that, 'cause I actually haven't seen the movie. If he thinks it's so good, maybe we should cover it on Carpool Critics, our movie podcast, which happens to be having its biggest day ever right now! Apparently the new episode is pretty sick, so you guys should go listen to it, or even watch it on YouTube. Carpool Critics, (wags tongue). And come back on Monday, and we'll have other people giving you other news. Equally fun. Almost.",

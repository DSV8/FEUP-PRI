The simple reality is that a lot of people want big screens: be it aging eyesight, larger workspace requirements, laptop-only workflows, whatever... and until last month, the only way to get an Apple laptop larger than 14\" in size was to spend at least $2,500 for a 16\" MacBook Pro that is hulkingly overkill for many that merely seek more display real estate. The option is great for those that need it, but I think more people believe themselves to need it than those that actually do.",

Lemme cook here. Since the MacBook Air debuted 15-years-ago, it hasn't been offered in a size greater than 13\". For a few years there, we had an even smaller version available at 11.6\", but never larger than 13 and it... never made sense. The simple reality is that a lot of people want big screens: be it aging eyesight, larger workspace requirements, laptop-only workflows, whatever... and until last month, the only way to get an Apple laptop larger than 14\" in size was to spend at least $2,500 for a 16\" MacBook Pro that is hulkingly overkill for many that merely seek more display real estate. Adding a larger panel to the M2 MacBook Air everyone already liked was a no-brainer and most everything that was good about that machine transfers over: the phenomenal keyboard is the best Apple has ever put in a laptop with excellent travel and a full-size function row, the webcam won't hold a candle to a smartphone but provides better picture quality than most competing products and offers a number of useful effects. Our testing discovered that the screen offers surprisingly even backlighting and about 470 nits sustained brightness which is adequate for most buyers. Now, that larger display does require a beefier battery, but our testing still achieved 10-11 hours of fairly heavy mixed usewhich is, in a word: great. And the good doesn't stop there. In fact, there's a number of things that the 15\" does even better than it's smaller sibling. I was really underwhelmed by the tinny 13\" Air's speakersthey were bad. The 15\" Air has much better low-end response and avoids distortion altogether; however, I did still find it to get a tad muddy near about 70% volume or higher. They don't hold a candle to the MacBook Pro, but they're adequate. Here's a comparison: We discovered in our review of the 13\" M2 Air that the silicon throttled fairly heavily during sustained workloads due to the lack of a spinning fan. The 15\" continues this trend and it can't match the sustained performance of an actively cooled M2 Mac mini; however, it makes fairly major improvements over the smaller Air in sustained workloads across the board: from synthetic tests like Cinebench to real-world loads such as video encoding tasks and Xcode project compile times. Given the nearly identical looking cooling strategy, this basically comes down to good 'ol physics: greater thermal mass can absorb and dissipate greater thermal energy. Go figure. While the keyboard doesn't add any features over the 13\" Air, the trackpad certainly does gaining a massive size increase. Other small changes found between models are that I find the 15\" easier to open one-handed given its heavier bottom case, and despite having the same webcam, the 15\" Air seems a little bit sharper than the 13\". Additionally, the same-sized-notch-on-a-bigger-screen means that you're less likely to encounter apps that push menubar items across said notchthough, it'll still happen pretty often if you're a heavy pro apps user. Whereas these computers share the same strengths, they also share the same weaknesses. I mentioned in last year's M2 Air review that the advertised starting price is a bit of a lie because anybody wanting to future-proof themselves would do well to avoid this insane stock config: 256GB of storage and 8GB of memory. In 2023. For reference, those were the same stock specs on the 2015 MacBooka computer with the same starting price tag as this onebut released 8 years ago. Additionally, like the 13\" Air before it, the upgrade pricing for memory and storage on this machine is ludicrous. We live in a world where you can pick up a 2TB Samsung 980 Pro with 3x greater disk speeds than the SSD in this machine for $100. What does Apple charge to upgrade to 2TB of storage? Oh, you know, just eight times more than that. By the time you hit what I'd consider a reasonable configuration for now and the future, you're no longer at $1,300you're at $1,700. And guess what you can get for $1,700? A 14\" M2 Pro MacBook Pro. That's a machine that has a massively improved displaybest in class, in factwith a high refresh rate, HDR, miniLED backlighting, better color accuracy, and dual-pixel native resolution. It's a machine with a significantly faster SoC that also stays whisper quiet offering better performance and similar battery life. It's a machine with better speakers, a better microphone array, a better webcam, better I/O, the ability to drive multiple displays, it's better at literally everything save one area: weight and size. But here's the thing... it's only marginally heavier with a moderately smaller screen.k And that's something I haven't brought up yet. The 15\" MacBook Air is not Air-like. You will not find yourself marveling how light it feels relative to how large it is like Apple's smaller notebooks. This thing is 22% heavier and 27% larger than the 13\" MacBook Air and you feel every percent. In a backpack, I cannot tell the difference between the 15\" Air and the 14\" Pro. The new Air is not even class-leading when comparing itself to Windows notebooks in weight. Both the latest Microsoft Surface and LG Gram are lighter. Don't misunderstand... I'm not saying the 15\" MacBook Air is a bad buyif you value screen size relative to weight above all else, you'll be very happy with this machine. Furthermore, this is going to be a big hit amongst businesses that want to offer a larger display size option to employees without the expense of a 16\" MacBook Pro. But if you're a regular joe that finds 13\" just a little too small, I urge you to go check out the 14\" MacBook Pro. If that's a screen size that seems viable, you'll be happier with the display, silicon, I/O, and everything else now and into the future. The 15\" MacBook Air is nearly perfectbut it has to compete with the best value laptop Apple's ever madea computer I don't think Apple themselves will be able to ever top again. If you'd have told me 5-years-ago that we'd need to weigh our options when considering a new MacBook because they're all too good, I'd have never believed youbut the future is now, baby. And I'm here for it. Thanks so much for watching, and as always, stay snazzy.",

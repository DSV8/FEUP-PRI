    "transcript": "- Hey guys, how's it going? It's Justine, and today we're gonna be talking about the new 2018 MacBook Pro that just came out, and I'm so excited because I'm going to be doing a little bit of a comparison between the 2018 MacBook which is over here, the iMac 18-Core, and the 2016 MacBook Pro which is over here. But all three computers behind me are completely spec'd out. So the specs that I ended up getting in the 2018 is the 2.9 i9 processor, 32 gigs of RAM, and yes, I did opt for the four terabyte hard drive. One of the things that is a big misconception I think, with a lot of normal people, a lot of consumers who don't know any better, is hard drive space. I know a lot of you guys are super tech-savvy, so you probably are already aware of this, but hard drive space make such a huge difference when you're doing anything. Copying files, editing, rendering those videos that you're editing. So I decided to do a hard drive speed test. I ran them on all three of these computers. Normally, when I edit, I am editing off of a Samsung T5 drive. It is a solid-state drive, it's two terabytes. So because I travel a lot, this is what I basically edit almost all of my content off of. This is significantly slower than the hard drives that are inside of these MacBooks. The 2016 MacBook Pro was only able to go up to two terabytes, 16 megabytes of RAM, and this is the i7 2.9 GigaHertz processor. And this 18 Core iMac Pro, I did end up getting the four terabyte hard drive, and I also upgraded the RAM to 128 gigs, which is quite excessive. One of the craziest things I think there were tons of memes and stuff going around is the price jump of the hard drive. Because if you wanted to completely spec out this 2018 MacBook, the four terabyte solid-state drive was like, $3,400. That's a lot of dollars. That's an entirely new computer. The iMac Pro 18-Core four terabyte solid-state drive. The right speed was 2,908 megabytes a second, and the read speed was 2,531 megabytes a second. Now let's compare that to this drive, which is a Samsung T5, and this is about $800. The right speed is 429 megabytes a second, and the read speed is 500 megabytes a second. I still edit pretty much everything off of here, but the past few videos, the Linus tour that I did, and the MKBHD video, those were all shot on red, so I edited both of those directly on my laptop. And I could really tell a difference, because I was so used to editing off this drive, that this is sort of what my normal was, until editing off of this drive, because my previous MacBook only had two terabytes. So that was almost not even an option to be able to edit multiple videos on there. Two terabytes, the right speed was 1,491, and the read was 1,067 megabytes a second. Now that brings us to the 2018 MacBook Pro. 2,659 megabytes a second, versus the read speed of 2,650 megabytes a second. So really what this leads is the hard drive in here is almost just as good as the hard drive that is in this iMac Pro. Another thing that's new in the 2018 MacBook Pro, was the True Tone display. So much like your iPhone, or any other phones, or any other displays that tend to change colors or shift as the day or the light changes, it is an option. You also can turn it off, especially if you're doing graphics or anything that your color needs to be very true. But I've actually left it on because I've been doing a lot of email and some scripts and things like that. So you can definitely tell a difference if you're looking for it, but what's cool is you don't really notice it as the light is changing. It's just something that is, it's just, magically happening before your eyes, I don't really know how else to explain it. Oh, I feel like I have so much I wanna cover in this video but it's super overwhelming to try to gather all of my thoughts, because I also wanna talk about the eGPU. Now I did a render test, just to see if it would make a difference in Final Cut Pro and it didn't make one at all. Where the eGPU would come in handy and if this is something that you're doing, this will also work very well with one of the old 2016 MacBook Pros. The eGPU will work great if you're doing 360 content. If you have a VR headset connected to the eGPU, it will use the graphics card in the eGPU as opposed to your MacBook, and you can still have the external Thunderbolt monitor connected as well. So for a lot of people who are just normal tech consumers, may have no idea what an eGPU is. It is an external graphics processing unit. So what's cool, is Apple has basically created a plug and play solution for an eGPU. Previously, it's not really that crazy complex, but it definitely wasn't as easy as a plug and play solution, and since it's eGPU isn't upgradable, what you have is what you get. But, this thing is kind of crazy because you basically plug it in and it works. There's nothing, you don't have to do anything else. So if you do use the eGPU and you don't use an external monitor, there will only be a few apps that really will be able to take advantage of it. One of those is Davinci Resolve. I might have to ask some favors from some friends who I know are very proficient in Davinci. They can do a demo for me, so that I can actually give you guys a very accurate depiction of what that actual process is. So let me know if that's something that you guys would be interested in. I also would like to find some friends who edit in Premiere so that I can give you a full demo of that. Although I'm pretty positive there's a bunch of people already on YouTube that have done that already. Whereas I'm over here, Final Cut for life. I am a ride or die FCP10, baby! Not to sidetrack too much, I actually started editing in Premiere maybe like, 15 years ago. And then I learned after effects, and then after that, I went and edited Avid for years, and then I was like, \"This sucks! Why are we using Avid \"to do some very simple tasks? \"I'm teaching myself Final Cut.\" And then I learned Final Cut, and then it just all was, I guess it was uphill? And then it took a slight downhill when Final Cut 10 was completely redesigned. And then I stuck with it, and then slowly, slowly, slowly we were on the incline. And now I am absolutely in love, and I think a lot of the people who did switch over to Premiere, may be back and potentially eyeing up Final Cut, I don't know, correct me if I'm wrong. We now have way more advanced color grading options. We can edit 360 video. It's been my platform of choice. I have edited thousands and thousands of videos on it. What else was I gonna do? Oh, you may notice that we've got three Xbox controllers here. I play Fortnite on Xbox and on Nintendo Switch. I wanted to test out Fortnite on all three of these Macs. Which crazy, I actually have not played Fortnite on a Mac yet. Surprising, I know. And then when I was traveling, my sister and I would actually travel with a PC, and I would play Fortnite specifically on the PC while I was editing on my Mac, so it got a little unnecessary. So I am excited to try out Fortnite. I did just order one of the 5K LG monitors. I wanted to find somebody that had it, but none of my friends had it, so I was like, \"Shoot.\" I need this to test out this eGPU properly. These are my three favorite Xbox controllers. This is my custom one, that I got made. It's got my little gamer tag on it. This is my Minecraft pig controller. And then last but not least, this is one of the newer ones that they just came out with. I love this teal color, it matches my iPhone. I've gone on so many tangents on this video, I'm so sorry. So the first test that I really wanna do, is a render test, because most of my time is spent in Final Cut and exporting and rendering and Compressor. So I'm gonna export it in the 4K system share settings, and we're off to the races. I also have one of the FLIR ONEs, I've had this for so long, and I was like, \"I think today's the day that we need to bring this out.\" this is a reusable straw, just in case, 'cause I gotta cover all the bases, because you guys are very perceptive and I'm sure I'll be judged for every absolute thing that you possibly could think about. So I do have open, the Intel Power Gadget so I'll be able to get all of the data, whether it's being throttled, the temperature of my CPU, pretty much everything. So we'll be able to see this, right here. Wait, I'm a little overwhelmed. See, so the hottest part of this MacBook is about 110 to 111 Fahrenheit. This one's about 104, and this MacBook over here is about oh, it's about 111, 112. Okay so now it's at 121, 118, 119. So, interesting because my CPU usage is only about 27%. On here it's like, 5%. (giggles) and over here it's like 38. And it definitely does seem to be throttling a little bit because it is not using its entire capacity, but it's also not entirely using the full CPU usage. The fans are so much louder on this guy. Like, significantly louder. So it is definitely being throttled, but I don't understand why this one is so much quieter than this one over here. So are there different fans? 'Cause it's been seven minutes, 47 seconds. Here's where we currently are. Here's our iMac Pro, it's really insane of the fact that it's only using like, oh my God, like 3% to 9% of the processor. We've got it's using about, 32%, this one is staying at a pretty consistent 76 Celsius, 72 Celsius, 87 degrees Celsius. It is interesting because the fans over here are so incredibly loud, and the fans over here are so much softer. One of the other things that is quieter about this new MacBook Pro, is the keyboard. There's a slight silicone little layer that they put under it, which I think was probably to avoid the problems that they were having with the previous version. I never had any really serious issues with my keyboard, but a lot of people were having dust that was getting trapped underneath of it, so it was causing their keyboards to not work properly. I did have a little bit of trouble with my space bar and the tab key. And my solution for that, I just kept going like this, (taps keyboard rapidly) and it magically fixed itself. I don't know if that's a good thing, but guess what? It worked. Let's test out the keyboard to see if it sounds any different. As you can see, this is where the audio's coming from. So I'm just gonna place it right here. (keyboard tapping) you can definitely tell there's a difference. It's not that substantial. (computer beeps) this is interesting. Am I going crazy? In this specific test... Are you gonna tell me that this $15,000 computer rendered this video slower than the $7,000 computer? Because I'm just pretty sure that's what just happened. So in Compressor, exporting 4K, 2018 exported at 13 minutes three seconds. The iMac Pro at 15 minutes and 15 seconds. This guy, at 15 minutes 46 seconds. (Hypnotic music plays) What do you mean? Hey, this is future Justine. I actually completely finished editing this video, but a lot of you guys on Twitter wanted me to put my MacBook in the refrigerator and see what happens. So there's been a lot of memes going around about the thermal throttling on the i9. I don't have an i7 to test, but I also feel like when I was exporting this video on my 2016 MacBook Pro, it was also throttling. So it feels like this is something that they may have been doing for a long time and just now I think, people are figuring it out. I'm not sure. I've actually never tested this before, so I have no prior data except what is before me right now. What am I doing with my life? What is happening right now? Now that everything in my fridge is going to not be in my fridge... Oh, these are rotten! These have been in here for months. I don't recommend trying this, because it's really stupid. I know people have done way stupider things on the internet, so, what I'm doing, I look like a genius. These are also both plugged in, so that the variables are pretty much the same. Let's hit export and see what happens, shall we? So they're both going now. Okay, we're gonna be able to kind of see in there. So we are about three minutes in, 26, 27% of the processor. About 88 degrees celsius. So here's the 2016. About 86, 87 degrees. It seems to be about the same. The frequency up here is definitely spiking a lot more than down here. (gentle music) we're about six minutes in. Our temperatures are ranging from about 108, here's the 2016 MacBook. This one is saying about the same as well. Oh no. The fridge is telling me to shut it. We have a problem. So here's 2018 once more, at about nine minute 38 minutes. 2016 at about eight minutes as well. I'm gonna close this back up one last time and let it finish. I think I'm getting worse performance out of my fridge test. Alright, looks like our first MacBook is done. And it is the 2018 MacBook. Let's bring out our contender! This is absolutely stupid and I hate myself for everything that I just did right now. At least I was able to clean out my refrigerator, so that's one good thing that we achieved today. So my previous export was 13 minutes and three seconds, and this export was 13 minutes six seconds. I actually got worse performance by putting my computer in the refrigerator, go figure. Let's take out our other contender. Are you done yet? This is not sponsored by Mountain Dew, or eggs, or cheese, or tomato soup. Or Apple, for that matter. So my previous export was 15 minutes and 46 seconds, and this one was 15 minutes and 39 seconds. So fridge export helped the 2016 MacBook Pro. Let's give you a round of applause. (children cheering) this is the first time I'm playing Fortnite on a Mac! I don't even know how to feel right now. Would you like to automatically apply the best settings for your system? Yes. (pushes controller buttons) this is doing something weird. I don't know if it's the controller, or. I'm used to having a touch screen with my Surface. (laughs) so this controller was definitely messing up. I've used it before for games. Why are you doing this to me now? Let me go get a mouse. Well. Oh no! Where am I gonna put this? I need a dongle! I just wanna play the game. Let me play the game. Okay this was taking awhile to load, so I went downstairs to get a snack. Apparently, we're dropping in baby! It looks pretty smooth. So it looks like it's running on 60 frames, windowed full screen. View distance, far, high, high, high, high, high. Pardon my snack. There's 29 people left. So at this point, all I gotta do is hide out. I don't even have to build anything. But I don't even have a weapon yet! Oh God, I gotta go loot! I'm sitting here trying to make a video and not paying attention to my game. I need to at least get a weapon so I'll be able to defend myself. I think one of the things that would help in this scenario, is having an external monitor and having the eGPU connected. So in this scenario, I do wanna test that out, because right now, I mean, this is, this is not, this is not the best experience. But, let me go back inside here, and let's change some settings to medium, medium, medium, medium, medium. Medium. I do still wanna be playing in 60 frames a second, so let's see if that helps. Oh, yeah. That helped immensely. There's 16 people left, so obviously I'm a freakin champion. But all I have are shotguns, so these are trash. What am I gonna be able to do with this? Nothing. Keke, do ya love me? 14 people left. The storm is a'shrinkin. So I should probably try to find something that's a little bit better than what I have. And I would like to be honest with you guys, I really never play with a mouse and keyboard. Everybody probably has all of the good weapons over here, so it's like defeating the purpose to even... Oh, what's over here? Oh, just some ammo, okay. Runnin around like a fool. With three shotguns. And, yeah, like what is that gonna do? Gonna do absolutely... Oh, mommy found herself a mini gun. Do you wanna, oh. Do, I want that. I hear somebody. Eight people left, guys. I'm super nervous. Oh my gosh. I'll take that. Hey Siri. Play Slipknot, Wait and Bleed. I forgot, that these MacBooks have \"Hey, Siri\" integrated now. - [Siri] Now playing Wait and Bleed, by Slipknot. - oh my God, I gotta get outta here! I felt the hate rise up in me Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves I wander out where you can't see Inside my shell I wait and bleed I feel like this is my theme song when I play Fortnite, because I literally just wait. Of leaves, I wander out where you can't, NO! Oh God! Where! (screams) No! Stop playing. I wasn't even paying attention. That's what I get for trying to remember Slipknot lyrics from back when I was in high school. I'm also upset that my controller didn't work. I'm gonna look into that as well. But for the sake of this video and my rage that I have. Do wanna test it out on the iMac Pro. Alright so, we're dropping in. This already feels a little bit smoother than the 2018 MacBook Pro did. The question is, will right click work? (gasps) Oh. My. Goodness. Let's get it. Will I be able to snipe this dude? Is the question. Oh God, I'm too scared. You're gonna kill me, and I'm gonna be really sad about it. (machine gun fire) okay, well I can't really, I can't click my mouse, I can't! It's not working. This is not working out the way that I was hoping. Oh my God, I gotta get, I gotta switch mice. No! Shoot! Cause I couldn't hold the right click in, and then also shoot at the same time. You, you, you're making me so mad. Surprise, this LG monitor actually showed up overnight. It wasn't even due to ship for another few days, so this is super exciting because I really wanted to test out Fortnite on the eGPU and an external monitor. So let me show you guys how easy this eGPU is. I seriously do nothing. I plug it in. If you can see it, but there's like a little light that turns on at the bottom. And it's activated. (clicks) there was a slight click. And three, two, it's already connected. This monitor is actually a lot nicer than I thought. I've only seen it in the stores, but I've never really seen it up close and personal. Another thing, this Thunderbolt cable is so freaking small. Can you please give us a little more slack? At least this is a little bit better. One of the great things about the eGPU is you can also use it to charge your MacBook, and it is one of the first eGPUs that will allow you to use a Thunderbolt display. So let's test and see if my MacBook will charge if I unplug this. It's still charging. And this also gives you four USB 3 ports, plus an HDMI out, which means, I don't need a dongle for my mouse. Alright, so already it definitely feels a lot different than just playing on the MacBook, which I would hope so, because I am playing with an entirely separate graphics card, so this is way smoother. (soft rhythmic music) look at that. I can't believe it took me this long to get one of these LG monitors to try out. This thing is really, really beautiful. I also would like to reiterate that I mostly played this on Xbox, and when I did play on PC, I also used a controller, which I know that's, that's like, I've probably committed so many sins in some of your eyes, but I'm not gonna apologize because really, I'm me, you're you, you do what you want, and I'm not gonna say anything about it. So you shouldn't say anything about my choices. (keyboard clicking) let's break up some stuff. Give me all of your goods. Surprenter. Yes. You're dead. I think it's dead. Well I actually used to play a lot more PC gaming. Oh my gosh, that's really what got me into playing first person shooters, like Unreal Tournament, and Quick Three. I never, I never really got into CS:GO, but I guess more recently, I've played Overwatch on PC, I played Diablo III on PC. But I really, I mean, I just I prefer playing on a console mostly, because that's where my friends play. And I think that is kind of the whole point of playing games, is the whole social aspect. I mean, it is fun to play alone if you're playing like, Sigma, but oh God, there's somebody over there. And I'm definitely not ready for confrontation. What was I saying? Oh, I don't know, the social aspect of games. Because I used to go to LAN parties, and it was a social experience, but the internet used to be so bad back in the day that that was what you had to do. Oh, now I'm just givin away my freaking location. Surprised how well this is running. I mean, it looks really, really good. Drink it up. Oh no, somebody's already been here. (sniper shooting) oh boy, I'm scared. I'm scared, I am not ready. (machine gun fire) no, there's somebody else shooting me! Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. (machine gun fire) no. No! Geez, God. Freaking driving me absolutely insane. I'll tell you what. This looks really, really good. I'm surprised. Okay, thank you so much for watching this video. I really, did enjoy testing this out. There's so many more things that I do wanna test out, so I'm sure I will do a follow-up video in typical iJustine fashion of One Week with MacBook. Two Weeks with MacBook. Three Weeks, Four Days with MacBook. Let me know if there's any other things that you'd like to see me test with this. I know a bunch of my other tech friends are probably doing very, very comprehensive, in-depth reviews, so be sure to go check them out. I will put, as I see them, I will put their links in the description. So we'll say that this LG monitor is so beautiful, and I can't believe it's taken me this long to get one. It really does look absolutely insane. So all that being said, I don't even know what you guys got out of this video, if you got anything, if you're entertained, if you love me more, now you hate me even more, I'm not really sure, but if you wanna subscribe, feel free to do so. I will have a bunch more videos. I have some fun things planned for you guys, and I look forward to posting those and editing them. So now I'm gonna take this monitor upstairs and connect it to my iMac Pro. So having this much more screen real estate to edit is gonna be incredible. (upbeat pop music)",

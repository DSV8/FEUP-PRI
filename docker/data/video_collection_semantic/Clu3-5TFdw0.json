    "transcript": "- Yeah, I love hacking APIs. (light music) APIs are my favorite things to hack because they are so vulnerable. Oh, yeah, 100%, I really do genuinely recommend it as a great place to start for beginners primarily because it's more about how much time you invest and less about the technical know-how. And this might seem okay. This is a fake API. Again, this is genuinely how I hack. I actually have a script that tests this automatically on real clients so I don't even have to do the work of typing in roles and I can see here it's returning all of the roles, and this is such a common issue. It's often called broken access control, but genuinely some of vulnerabilities that I've been paid one to five grand for have been as simple as this. These are not technical vulnerabilities. They just take a lot of time because you'd have to brainstorm a lot of words to do with university and school and you'd have to try a lot of different things. But I tell you what beginners have more than anything else. Time, enthusiasm, passion, and we'll have a go. (upbeat music) - Hey, everyone, it's David Bumble back with a very, very special guest, Katie, welcome. - Thank you so much for having me. I'm really excited to be here. - Yeah, I'm really looking forward to this. So before we get started, I just wanna say this. Make sure that you go and subscribe to Katie's YouTube channel. Katie has fantastic content on her YouTube channel. Go and follow on Twitter, and Katie, we were talking offline. Where on your channel do you recommend that people start? Can you show us where to start on your channel? I believe you've got a playlist that we can look at. - Yes, if anyone is interested in getting into hacking and you basically have no idea where to start, I fully recommend my \"New to Bug Hunting? Now That's What I Call Bug Bounty 2020.\" It goes through step by step how to get started, some common issues that people have, how to use some of the tools we use, and it's all designed for beginners. There is also \"Everything API Hacking\" which has basically all the content I've ever made on hacking APIs which is what we're gonna do today. - I'll just say this. I've looked at some of your videos. You've got amazing content there. So for everyone who's watching, if you don't get what you need from my channel or this specific video, go and have a look there. Katie does a fantastic job with bug bounty but APIs as well and that's the focus of this video. You are gonna show us how to hack a university and change your grades. And I mean, disclaimer. This is a test university, not a real university, right? - Yeah, so I actually work for a real university and obviously my students love the idea of hacking the university. So induction week when I'm teaching them, I'm like, \"Do not touch the university.\" So instead I redirect them to a Generic University. - And this is something that people can get from GitHub, right? - Yes, this is completely available. Somebody has very kindly put it on Docker as well, so there are so many different ways. You can just Google Generic University. It is the top result on Google which is probably one of my most proudest moments. - So just for everyone watching, once again, I'll put links below to Katie's Twitter, to her YouTube, I'll put links to GitHub. But Katie, I don't wanna you keep you any longer. Do you wanna take us through what you're gonna demo? I believe you're gonna show some of the OS top 10 stuff because this is what this is about, right? - Yeah, so Generic University is a nice university. (David laughs) - [David] Until you hack it. - You've been kind of wandering around, doing a bit of reconnaissance, and you've come across this webpage and this is a kind of feature that's a work in progress. It's like a view your grade system, it's under construction. Brannon in it are still working on it though he does have the ability for you to report a security vulnerability. If we open it up in Burp Suite here. Now Burp Suite is a fantastic tool for web pen testers. It is basically the tool that everybody uses. So we've got a lot of very large amount of tabs. We're gonna be primarily focusing today on the Target tab and the Repeater tab. So in our target if we kind of see here, we can see every end point this is hitting from the login page to the vulnerability page to probably the most exciting part which is the API. - Yeah, so I mean that's gonna be the focus of this video, right? And I'll just say this. - Yeah. - You've done a lot of work recently on APIs. It's sort of like a focus of yours recently, is that right? - Yeah, I love hacking APIs. APIs are my favorite things to hack because they are so vulnerable. They are just full of security flaws and it kind of makes sense. It's quite easy to miss them because when you've got a developer that's developing a huge API that might have thousands of different ways of using it that might be for developers, or it might be for regular users, or it integrates with an app, it very quickly gets kind of out of hand and you just lose track of where your security is. But that's great for me as a hacker because I pick them up, and I get paid, and I love that. - Yeah, I was listening to one of your other interviews where you're talking about your first bug. You got to give us, just give us the 30-second overview. You were in a competition, is that right? And you found it straight away or something? It was an amazing story. - Yeah, so I'd never done any hacking before, like ever. I actually had rejected doing any hacking 'cause I was like that sounds way too difficult for me. I am not that clever. - Right, says someone with a PhD, right, yeah. - Yeah, I was like I'm good at some things, but hacking is not one of them and I was really fortunate that my friends bullied me into it. They were like, \"Hey, Katie, you should come to this,\" and I was like, \"Mm, I dunno. I'm not really good at hacking,\" and they just bullied me into it. And I was like okay fine, I'll go. And when I was there, I was hacking on Uber. I got my first, first bug, got my second bug. Got paid my first bounty. I got paid $1,000. Got invited to go to Vegas. Found two more vulnerabilities in Vegas, Was getting these crazy bounties and hanging out with some of the best hackers in the world, and I realized I might actually be good at this. This may not be the hardest thing like I think it is. It might actually be something that I could do. - I wanted to ask you about that 'cause you say you're really excited about APIs and it sounds like if someone's new to hacking and they have that nervousness perhaps like you had in the past, APIs is a great place to start, is that correct? - Yeah, 100%, it doesn't require technical skill. It just requires time. You need to invest a lot of time into understanding an API and how it's supposed to work and kind of how it could be broken and what the client really cares about. So they're great places to start because as long as you are super obnoxious and just keep on going, you can actually find a bug eventually. By far one of my most favorite things to hack. - So if I'm new to sort of bug bounty, I'm new to hacking in 2022, I'm assuming based on what you've said this is a great place to start. - Oh, yeah, 100%, I really do genuinely recommend it as a great place to start for beginners primarily because it's more about how much time you invest and less about the technical knowhow. And obviously as you get more experienced, it becomes a lot easier. I've found bugs in literally five minutes, it's crazy. I was surprised when that happened. If you're just starting out, you invest an hour of time. You kind of get a pretty good return on your time investment, so it's by far the biggest thing I recommend starting with. - That's brilliant, and the software using, that's Community Edition, right, of Burp? - Yes, it's completely free, You can download it. - That's great, sorry, I didn't wanna, I took you on a tangent there, sorry. - No, it's all good. But yeah, so this is Burp. It's got a lot of features and I'm gonna ignore most of them because API hacking is about just trying everything and seeing if it works. It's about hitting your head against a brick wall and eventually getting through it. So I'm just gonna click on this and say Send to Repeater, and what Repeater does is repeat a request. So it repeats what we've sent it so we can send it again. - Sorry, I just wanna ask sort of the beginner question. Sorry, Katie, so you opened the university webpage in a browser while you had Burp running and that's what we saw just a second ago, right? - I went here, open browser, and then I just opened it up in the background. - And then you captured that information, right, okay? - Yeah, it does it all automatically now, it's quite nice. - Great. - If I go to Repeater and I just press Send, it's gonna send exactly the same data as I've already sent. So I can see here it's gonna make a request for API users and it's gonna make a request for the sixth user, and here I can see I've got some information and this is where Brannon's name is coming up. He's the sixth user. For some reason the API is getting the sixth user. We can kind of see how this API is designed to perform. Now one really fun thing about APIs is that once you have an idea of the structure, they become really easy to hack because if you wanna get the sixth user, you put a slash six. If you wanna get all the users, you simply get rid of the ID, press Send, and then it will return every single user in the database. And I wish I was joking when I said I've actually found this bug on real clients. A surprising amount do not restrict this and we just send back everything, and you can see how I've got some lovely test accounts that I've made as well. But we can see Walter Waters who's a student. We can see Rosetta who's a student and we kind of don't necessarily know 'cause it does say role_id one and role_id two. So if I'm seeing some name and then underscore id, the first thing I'm gonna try is replacing this because if I have a user ID and that six, then I'm gonna do api/users. If I have something called role_id, I'm gonna go in here and try roles. And this might seem okay. This is like a fake API. Again, this is genuinely how I hack. I actually have a script that tests this automatically on real clients so I don't even have to do the work of typing in roles and I can see here it's returning all of the roles. We've got an id one Admin, id two Student, id three Teacher. And now if I kind of go back to what I had before, I can kind of understand this a bit more. That's a student, that's a student. Student, student, admin, instructor. The interesting thing about APIs is that I think people often kind of focus too much on the technical things because we see our login here. Now we don't know a user account but we do know it's /login and this is why we like API hacking in particular because sometimes it just takes a little leap of logic to go if login exists, maybe register exists and then you can register a new account. I'm gonna put in Katie here. Type in a lovely fake email address. Better make it password1234, and Register, and now you can see we've got an actual account. Now this is really important for broken object level authorization and broken function level authorization. Once we have an account, we can test privileges beyond our own. So think about an admin should be able to edit say what class is somebody is in. A user shouldn't, they should just be able to see what they're in. A instructor should be able to change the grades, a user doesn't. Now we need to figure out okay, what other APIs are there? And if we wanna just kind of brute force this, we can try things like, it's called view your grades. We could try grades, classes, course, university. We can just kind of come up with names again just from our own brain. We're not trying to go through super complex technical stuff. We're just like this is a university website. What words are to do with universities? You might end up with /grades and uh oh, we've got our first error. So this is a 401 error and that means unauthorized. So if we scroll down though, it says unauthenticated. Now these are really two different ideas and they're both really important for broken access level authorization and broken function level authorization vulnerabilities. Authenticated refers to whether or not we're logged in. Authorized refers to what permissions we have. So the question we might ask ourself is okay, is this actually unauthorized or is this unauthenticated? As in if we have an account which we do now, could we now do it? And this is such a common issue. It's often called broken access control, but genuinely some vulnerabilities that I've been paid one to five grand for have been as simple as this. - [David] Wow. - These are not technical vulnerabilities. They just take a lot of time because you'd have to brainstorm a lot of words to do with university and school and you'd have to try a lot of different things. But I tell you what beginners have more than anything else. Time, enthusiasm, passion, and we'll have a go. - I love that you're taking this back to the real world and I think that's an important thing. You're doing bug bounty. You're doing this in the real world. I mean this is a demo site because obviously for YouTube and obviously for demos like this, we can't use a proper site. But it's so nice to hear that this is actually what you're finding out there. - Oh yeah, 100%, and this whole Generic University comes from real vulnerabilities I've found. One of my favorites is for an a website to do with airplanes you could change the runway lengths. As long as you were logged in, you could change the runway length. - And this may seem like kind of small. It's like well, that's only a single number on a database. But then you realize, hang on. Airplanes need certain lengths of runway depending on how big they are because big planes can't stop in time. You have to think about the real world impact of that. You've got a quite a simple vulnerability. You could change something, only being logged in without necessarily being authorized to into you could kill 100 people because the plane could crash. Very unlikely that it would. Very unlikely that this would never get noticed, but I always think it's really important to think about the real world impact of things like that 'cause it's really easy to get caught up in the technical details and not consider hang on. There's actual real people who are gonna be using this system and they're the ones that really feel the effects of a security vulnerability. - So, Katie, just wanna make this clear. The university website you said is a Docker container. It's something that I can just download and then run and then I can do this myself, right? - Yes, so if you go on Generic University's GitHub page, it has full setup instructions if you wanna set it up. Or alternatively you can just use Docker and there's also instructions created by the very nice person who made that Docker container that goes over setting it up and then how to access it. But it should be as simple as like a few clicks and you can install it and have it go yourself. But yeah, so we're in Repeater now. This is where we see this cookie start to matter. So this is a JSON web token. Doesn't really matter what it means. It's just a way of kind of authorizing who somebody is. Now this is the one where we haven't been logged in. So if I go back to open up our account and I refresh the page, I can go into Proxy, HTTP history. I'm just seeing the history now and in here you can see that this cookie is actually now changed. Not massively, it's kind of difficult to notice. But the tell is always the eyJ. That means it's a JSON web token. So if I now right click, Send to Repeater, go back into Repeater and change this tab to be /grades, we can see here that we're getting a little internal server error and we're getting a ton of data back about the API, and we can see Class name must be a valid object or string. Tons of interesting things about the code. So now if we do it, we're getting a 200, okay? And we can see a bunch of grades. So 100%, 90%, 36%, 40% and you can see we can correlate those to a user ID. Now this alone would actually be reportable in a bug bounty program. Because a grade would be quite privileged information I would usually just report this, but let's do something more interesting because like I said, I made this specifically to stop my students from hacking the university. Now as much as we could do a get request, if we look at an API we can actually do things based on CRUD. Now CRUD stands for create. We can create a new object. Read, we can read an object or read a collection of objects. U, we can update and delete, we can delete a single object, and we've got the read here like we can read all the grades. We could probably put a slash one and read a singular grade, but again that's not very interesting because we could update the grade and give ourselves a slightly better grade. Now the great thing about restful APIs which is the type of API this is is that all of this is standard. So actually it's super easy to turn this from a read into an update. - And the only thing, I just wanna make sure I understand the only thing you changed was you created a fake account and then you logged in with those details. - [Katie] Yep. - [David] And now you're getting all this back, that's crazy, yeah. - Yeah, so again really common because what they do is they check for you being logged in. They don't necessarily check your permission level. They go hey, are you a teacher? Should you be able to see this? They may only check that you are logged in or not logged in and a lot of the time in the framework, so this was written in Laravel. A lot of the time in frameworks, it actually works out that by default some of the default code encourages this and you'd have to write kind of the checking code automatically, so people just don't do it. And this mainly comes from developers being short on time. It's not because they are purposely trying to do this. They have a lot of pressure to get code out the door and into their customers. They have to take shortcuts and this is a very common shortcut that people then take. - You mean it doesn't help when they've got these sprints the whole time, is it? - No, it really doesn't. - I mean like every two weeks, have to release new code. I mean, it's no wonder they make mistakes. - Yeah, and often developer productivity is actually measured in lines of code written. So if you think about creating a new feature, that might be 1,000 lines of code to get a feature out the door, but securing it may not even add anymore lines of code. That may just be one line of code and may take even longer than writing a super complex feature. - Yeah, it's no wonder the mistakes happen. Brilliant, but that's good news for you as a bug bounty hunter. - Yeah I love it, but my partner is a developer though so we have interesting dinner conversations. So getting a grade is really cool and being able to see them is kind of neat. We don't have the right permission level, but obviously I didn't make this just so students will be able to read a grade. I'm trying to influence their criminal minds here a little bit. So obviously we wanna change a grade as well. So if we have a look at the grades here, we can kinda look down and see there's someone getting 75. Someone getting 73, 44, 16. Now in the UK, a passing grade is 40 at university level. So let's lift up user_id three's grade here from 16, so a fail, all the way up to a really great passing grade. So what I'm gonna do is just copy exactly the same. So this is just copied from here and I'm just gonna change what I wanna change. So I'm gonna change that grade from 16 to 89. Add a nice job and as a hacker, we love to deface things. Katie was here 2022 and we can just get rid of the rest of it 'cause we don't wanna change those. It's just the created_at, the updated_at. We kind of don't really wanna leave a trace behind that we touched it anyway, so we can just kind of get rid of that. And the only thing I need to change now is tell it the content type. So I'm just gonna copy it from here and just put it anywhere up in the headers. And that's just saying hey, by the way, we've got some JSON. And then all I do is I change this GET to a PUT and I'm gonna change this to be the ID of the grade which is ID 12 and I'm gonna press Send. And would you look at that. Now user_id three has gone from a failing grade to a passing grade and this is how like simple my first vulnerability was that I found in Uber. I wish I was joking when I say that sometimes these tech companies, they think that oh, they're full of really clever people and I could never find a vulnerability. Actually they're full of a lot of people who make mistakes and that's what we're here to do. We're here to pick up the mistakes. - That's exactly right, I mean, Uber's a great example 'cause they were recently hacked by, what was it? 18-year-old from the UK, was it? - Yes, my favorite thing about tech companies is how often they get hacked by teenagers. It's really interesting 'cause it's what makes a hacker so great is having a different way of thinking because the developers all think in one way and they go oh, yeah, this is secure. But some teenager comes along thinking that ever so slightly differently and actually confines security flaws and flaws in processes that the company didn't even really think of. The guy at Uber bullied, essentially sent requests for over an hour to log into his account. Who would've thought that as a method for hacking? Just keep on trying and hope he eventually says yes out of sheer annoyance. - I love what you said in the beginning. You don't have to be hugely technical to understand this stuff and I mean, what he did there wasn't hugely technical. It was just irritating someone until he bypassed 2FA. It's amazing, go on, sorry. - That's what I really love about hacking. There's a lot of really technical stuff and I love technical things. I used to be a developer, so I do follow the technical things. But a lot of people, I think one of the biggest misconceptions is that you have to be a super technical genius to do this. You really don't, simply thinking a little bit differently is such a huge advantage and especially from people in groups who aren't necessarily already working in tech. I say for myself as a woman in tech, there's not a lot of people that look like me which means there's not a lot of people that think like me and I'm bringing something unique there that they don't necessarily have access to. - Yeah, it's amazing, I mean, like I said, my wife is so different to me. She reads things totally different and she sees solutions that I would never see. So it's great to have like you said, I mean, you work with teenagers 'cause you're at university where young people are. Younger than me 'cause I'm a Boomer. They must think very differently say to your typical tech guy or whatever. - Oh, yeah, 100%, I'm always surprised with how my students think. But I think a lot of people are like ha ha, Zoomers are gonna be just memeing. And they're not just memeing. They actually have really intelligent, kind of really thoughtful ways of thinking that I didn't even think about. And I use my mom as a bit of a code duck and my mom is terrified of computers. Genuinely cannot use a phone, cannot use a computer. Got scared because she accidentally hit the start menu button on her laptop and thought she'd broken the computer. - I know. - Very, very not very technically advanced, but you know what I call her just to kind of see how her brain thinks because it's always really interesting. I actually taught her how to hack in a YouTube video, so my mom does actually know how to hack. She'll now call me up and she'll be like Katie, there's a great radio show or radio forum about hacking, and she'll start talking to me about data breaches. And it's like that meme where it's like I made this, you made this, I made this. But it's like I'm a hacker and my mom's like I'm a hacker too now. - That's hilarious, I love it, I love it. I mean, and I think it's an encouragement because as you just said, the developers are so busy with deadlines and they're used to thinking a certain way. It's great to have people testing their APIs and I think it's an encouragement for anyone who wants to start or who's new to the industry. It doesn't matter how old you are. It doesn't matter if you're young or old or whatever. Get in and try it, and APIs are a great way to start. So that's brilliant, thanks for demonstrating this. - No, I'm happy to be here and as you know, this is not the only API flaw and not the only API flaw in Generic University. There are so many different types of API security vulnerabilities and some of them are gonna be more technical. Some of them are gonna require a ton of research, but actually quite a lot of them just require somebody who's willing to say I'm gonna try every single API endpoint and see whether or not it's vulnerable to this kind of attack and people make their entire full-time incomes on that. - Katie, you have a PhD, is that right? - I do. - And what is that in? - So my PhD is actually my background. So before I got into cyber security, I was actually into machine learning. So my PhD is actually in machine learning. I completely switched during my PhD from machine learning to cybersecurity because I realized that I liked machine learning, but actually I really enjoyed defensive security and I really liked to play the kind of bad guy if you will. I mean, I told somebody once that I've always wanted to be Sherlock and they were like, but aren't you now Moriarty? And I was like I'm personally offended by that. That's really mean, but yes. - I love that, so I mean, I've had this question many, many times and it's fantastic to have you talk about it. Will machine learning or will AI take away our jobs in cybersecurity or where do you see the trends? Where do you see it going with the sort of rising of AI? - I think a lot of people are really quick to push AI solutions to every single problem, but actually a lot of the kind of issues in cybersecurity, one are communication based. So when we tell developers that their code is broken, we can talk about that in a a really neutral way. It'd be like hey, by the way, this code has a vulnerability in it. But for a developer who might have spent months working on this project who kind of has spent quite a lot of time in it, that can actually be really difficult for them to hear and it's really important to have a level of empathy towards them. So that's one thing. It's all well and good to get a report, but that can make people feel really bad and also it can make people feel like they're gonna lose their jobs 'cause it's like how dare you write insecure code when actually writing insecure code, it happens, right? Security flaws are gonna happen. It's gonna be a problem. That's the reason why you have hackers to stop them from getting out of hand. Not necessarily as a cure for security flaws. The other thing is it requires a lot of creativity. A lot of people say oh, can't you teach AI to hack? And you can't because the amount of creativity and human thinking. At the end of the day, APIs are designed for computers but they're created by humans which means humans make design decisions which can impact how an API functions and therefore the types of security vulnerabilities. So given the communication aspect and the empathy mixed with the fact that you need creativity means it's actually really hard to find a machine learning solution and I don't think I've seen a good one, yeah. - So you don't think, I mean, there's a lot of hype of AI versus ML. So in reality today versus, I mean, forget about the movies. I think we all have this picture of the movies. Arnold, the robots are taking over. You don't think that's near term? Still very much human based. - No, I think it's gonna be very human based, especially in cybersecurity 'cause at the end of the day it's really hard to just automate this, let alone adding another layer and actually machine learning does have quite a lot of other issues. You need somebody who's an expert one, in machine learning, but two, in whatever you're trying to automate with it. You need somebody like me who has a machine learning background and a cybersecurity background and you need data, and you need statistics, and it's just you get to a point where it's like okay, these requirements are gonna be very hard to meet. - And do you see that both for offensive and defensive? Do you feel the same about both or do you think AI has a place in defending companies? - I think AI does have a place, but it's about supporting what people are already doing. It's about giving them the tools. Say for example, highlighting suspicious activity. Not making this a decision. Not saying hey, this is suspicious, but saying hey, this activity looks weird. What do you think? About really supporting people working and supporting their intuition and their problem solving, giving them more tools to do their job well. I think at the moment we see a lot of people selling hype and selling yeah, our's got machine learning. Our solution is the best. Our solution is this much better than our competitors. Actually I think it's about tools that kind of bring or make people's jobs easier. - I love that, I mean, I'm really glad you said that because a lot of younger people who watch my videos, I don't mean just younger people, but often it is. It's like okay, I want to get into cyber or I wanna make a career change. Is it worth it? So you give me advice, I'll take on that role. I'm let's say 18 or I don't have to be that young. I could be older, but I want to get into cyber but I'm concerned that there's no future in this. Would you recommend that as a career? I'm assuming you would because you changed from dev to this. - Yes, I do, and I think that there's a lot of careers people don't really think about. People think of cybersecurity as just hacking. I'm guilty of that. I'm guilty of seeing cybersecurity as just my hacking, but actually cyber is really broad. In general you have people who do more social engineering. You have policy makers. You have developer and security advocates within development teams. You have defense teams, offense teams. You have people who work in research versus more hands-on. Actually it's really, really broad and there's a lot of different places you can take an interest in cybersecurity to a career. I would always say the only thing you need to get a job in cybersecurity is passion for it and genuine interest. I think if you go into cybersecurity because you are really interested in it, that's great, that's fantastic. You'll go far no matter what exact path you take. - Let's say I want to do what you're doing. So talk to me as someone who's at the beginning of their journey. When I look at you, you've got a PhD. You've got all this development background. You're this amazing, some would say on a pedestal type person, but let's say I haven't got those kind of skills. Do you have sort of a roadmap or an idea of where would I start? I dunno where to start. Should I go do bug bounty and what would you advise me? And assuming you were back, you were younger again and you were starting out, what would you advise someone like me or like your younger self to do? - Well, that's such a good question. I think if I was advising my younger self, I'd probably advise them to do something different. If I was talking to my younger self, I'd tell her that just follow every opportunity you get. Don't just leave an opportunity hanging with a company. If somebody wants to follow in kind of what I'm doing, the biggest thing you can do is absorb information. Be an information sponge. YouTube, blog posts, news articles, podcasts. Just consume it, take notes. Really make sure that you are kind of, if you wanna learn a language, you will immerse yourself in that language, right? Maybe you live there. Maybe you'll listen to music in that language. Maybe you'll watch YouTube in that language, whatever. Maybe you'll play games in that language. Do the same for cybersecurity. Put on your headphones and just absorb yourself in the language of cybersecurity. See what people are talking about. See what really makes you interested 'cause just 'cause I'm interested in it, it doesn't mean you will be and it doesn't necessarily mean that this is the ultimate path to get into cybersecurity. But it does mean that you can kind of tailor it based on what you're passionate about, what you find interesting, and what really sparks joy for you. So I think number one is really immerse yourself in cybersecurity whether or not that's bug bounty. It doesn't necessarily matter. Just really immerse yourself in that world and join us on Twitter. Be part of the community. We actually have a really nice community. I will say I think a lot of people have this impression that the cybersecurity community is really unfriendly. But in my experience, I actually felt really welcomed into this community. And I know not everyone will go do a PhD and I don't recommend doing a PhD for everyone, but a lot of the skills I learned through my PhD about doing research and really immersing myself in something has really helped me on this journey even if the actual piece of paper didn't. - I love that, I mean, I think it's exactly that. Make contact and I think that's what's great about the world today. You can go onto the internet. You can go to YouTube. There's a lot of channels that you can follow. There's a lot of great information on Twitter. Follow you on Twitter and then just see who you follow and go down that rabbit hole of the people in the industry. And I think you gotta find your niche, don't you? It's so vast, you got to find what you enjoy. Katie, could you show us your YouTube channel again because let's say I'm interested in bug bounty. You have a playlist on bug bounty as well, don't you? - I do, so this is my YouTube channel. This is New to bug hunting? Start Here. That is kind of my greatest hits now. That's what I call bug bounty. It's designed to kind of be you watch one video after another and each one kind of builds on the previous ones. I've also got \"Everything API Hacking.\" So if you really interested in API hacking, that's a great video to start with, a great series and I've also got \"Introduction to Burp Suite\" as well that goes over the very basics of using it all the way up to advanced uses. I've got a ton of videos on all kinds of of topics including note taking and professional skills and things like careers. - Katie, before we wrap up, do you have a API playlist where you go into like more detail? If someone's interested in learning more, is there more details on your YouTube? And I think you've said already, but can you point us to a playlist and tell us kind of what it covers? - Yes, so I have Everything API Hacking which is basically all my content across when I've been guests on shows as well of API hacking. It's like several hours long and if you really wanna immerse yourself in API hacking, I really recommend it. I go over how to do reconnaissance, tooling, how to get started with mobile APIs, demonstrations. Some times I made real cash with vulnerabilities. Some tips, some different types of API content. There's a ton of really useful stuff in there if you just wanna do everything API hacking. - That's brilliant, so I'll put that below. Do you have any other resources, perhaps books or other people in the industry that you'd recommend that someone follows or books that they read if they're interested in API hacking? - Yes, so my number one piece of advice is securitycreators.video. This is a bunch of me and my friends who make videos on YouTube or that stream. And if you don't really like my content for whatever reason, there is definitely somebody else here whose content might vibe with the way you learn more. Mine is very much like watching a little lecture like Bug Bounty University, but there are some great content made by friends of mine that is huge. There's an API security book that came out on API hacking. It's just called \"API Hacking\" by Core Ball - That's this one of Corey, yeah, yeah? - Yeah, yes, there's that book and there is also \"Practical IoT Hacking\" which has an entire chapter on APIs and that's also super helpful. The OWASP Top 10. Again, the whole OWASP API Security Top 10, the discussion there as well. Super, super useful resources. - Katie, thanks so much for sharing (light music) and thanks so much for creating this university project. I'm hoping that it's stopped your university getting hacked and students attention is devoted to sort of this fake university. - Yes, I hope so too. I hope you could just let them in, have their little criminal minds be. I say that, but every single year, I'm like what do you want to learn about this year? And they're like I want to learn how to hack the university 'cause I think that's gonna annoy you, Katie. I love it, I love my students. They are great, and I got to say the kind of rapport is really good there. But yes, thank you very much for having me. It's been great to sit here and show you Generic University and actually how you can get in. I really hope that I've inspired some of the viewers watching to actually have a go at hacking yourself because I really do think, my two pieces of advice is one, hacking is not as hard as you think and two, hacking is not as easy as you think. It's somewhere in the middle, but that means it's totally achievable. If you're interested in this, please have a go, get involved. You can @ me on Twitter with questions and I happily answer some. - Some, I love that. Yeah, please don't flood Katie with too many questions. Please go and subscribe to her YouTube channel below. She's trying to grow her YouTube audience, so please go and subscribe, show some love. Go and follow her on Twitter. Katie, again, thanks so much for sharing. - Thank you so much for having me, it's been great. (upbeat music)",

    "transcript": "hello good people I'm a Dmitry and today let's talk about my favorite pair what's happening haircut time ha I think that's better but guys today we're talking about my favorite gaming headset now in all black roll the intro alright people so if you're looking for a gaming headset don't wanna be spending too much money on it and want something that has a good balance of features in terms of build quality sound quality microphone and comfort you of my friend have come to the right place because I have my favorite new pair of a gaming headset to show you this is the master up plus Sennheiser PC37X now this thing is so easy to recommend and in fact I've been recommending the game one pair to everybody who's been asking like what's the best gaming headset for $150 and now you have something identical because the PC37X is based on the game one body design and a driver design but is now thirty dollars cheaper let's check it out the new Toshiba XS 700 external SSD comes in this beautiful and minimalistic design its ultra portable form factor is perfect for creative professionals on the go and with blazing-fast USB 3 gen 2 transfer speeds and Toshiba's excellent three-year warranty reliability shouldn't be a concern check out the X's 700 from Toshiba down below so first let's start with comfort The Game one or the PC37X is by far the most comfortable gaming headset I've ever tried you know the clamping force is just right it collapses to pretty compact pair if you have a smaller head and they expand also quite large to accommodate for larger heads they are plastic but nothing is creaking and I have gone through only a single pair in four years so I had to replace my game one pair because something was happening with the volume wheel on the right side but as far as like the build quality concern you know nothing is broken on this thing and I just had to get the volume wheel repaired but otherwise this thing will last you for years even if you supercareful you know the GSP 500 for example is built like a tank but it is heavier the clamping force is not as good as on the the PC37X and one of the reasons why I still prefer this pair or the much more expensive $220 GSP 500 now I really appreciate Massdrop's UPS collaboration with Sennheiser and trying to cut the cost down one of which is I think the lack of any color on the headset which i think contributes to better looks you know despite this being a gaming headset it's not loud it's simple it's minimal you know there are no red color accents like on pretty much every other gaming headset now nothing physically has changed so we still get the volume wheel on the right side it does not fully mute the headsets or you can still hear a little bit when it's in the lowest position the microphone is muted when it's in the upright position and you can definitely hear the distinct click it has a little bit of motion and yeah overall I just I don't know I think it offers such a good balance between like style sound quality feature set and the microphone quality too and I love how slim profile they are on your head they're not completely sticking out and so you know Sun highs are going towards the route of like the GSP lineup which definitely has that different appeal that you can tell our gaming pair I'm glad that the PC37X for that original suite in terms of looking super simple like the game series so what you're hearing now is the microphone from the PC37X it is identical to the game one lots of body good detail no compression applied anywhere you know it sounds natural you could definitely stream with this let me put on the game one so you can hear they are identical so now I've got the game one on it sounds just as good as the PC37X lots of detail good body one of the best microphones in this class especially for this price point now the velour earpads are extremely comfortable not only to the touch when they're against your skin but also the clamping force is just perfect and despite them being such a low-profile headset your ears do not make contact with the interior driver which is awesome and the wall of the driver is angled for better sound direction the are removable if you want to give them a little bit of clean because the velour does attract a lot of lint and hair and skin particles so that's something to keep in mind the cable is removable which is awesome because sometimes that could be a point of failure so replacement is not an issue but it is braided so it does kink easily and it also does pick up quite a lot of cable noise from when it's brushing hasty body but it does split into dual 3.5 millimeter jacks so really the main selling point for these aside from the price comfortable quality microphone quality is the sound quality and these things sound fantastic in my opinion the most balanced gaming headset that you can receive that doesn't sound muddy not overly bass heavy you have a lot of detail still it's not overly harsh it's like a really good sound signature that definitely deserves the Sennheiser name so this pair is an open-back headset which means you can hear everything that's happening in your environment and that is beneficial for me for multiple reasons number one I don't miss any packages so if there's somebody at the door they're knocking or they're calling me I can hear what's happening in my physical environment number two I use the microphone a lot for phone calls and for game chat which means I can hear what I'm saying which is awesome because I hate the feeling of speaking into the microphone and not hearing myself I just I don't know I lose what I'm trying to say when I cannot concentrate on hearing myself and obviously the audio advantage of an open back design is a much wider soundstage so that your audio environment inside the game is expanded you can pinpoint where things are coming from you know audio has not closed off it's more expanded so it sounds like you're listening to something from larger speakers in the distance which is a great feeling if you're playing any open-world games that has you know just an open environment and you can like physically feel how distance certain sounds elements are inside the game now one thing I will say about the bass it's deep enough you know it doesn't have to be like really punchy like on other gaming headsets and that might be kind of a negative for you when you receive this pair put them on jump into your favorite game and you might be thinking hey where's my bass and that could be the a side effect of your previous pair being like really muddy and overly powerful in the bass department that really muffles out the rest of the mid-range or the the higher-end treble stuff whereas with these it's just balanced enough you can feel the bass but it doesn't overpower any of the other frequencies so treble here is detailed enough as well and it's not harsh the mid-range is awesome and overall the combination of like you know good bass good treble with mid-range and a really awesome fantastic soundstage is just like a really good recipe for an enjoyable experience alright guys so if you're in the market for a good gaming headset the PC37X is hard not to recommend because it just meets so many boxes and just over $100 is a fantastic deal make sure to check it out in the description below and if you want a little bit color accent the game one is still an option for $30 more but why not save yourself a little bit of money and go with something like this this is my new favorite gaming headset guaranteed thanks for watching we'll see you next",

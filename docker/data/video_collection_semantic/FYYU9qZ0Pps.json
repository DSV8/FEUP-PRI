    "transcript": "In this video I'm going to show you how to boot Kali Linux off a USB flash drive this is a Windows laptop but I've booted it from the USB flash drive but not only that I'm going to show you how to enable persistency in other words set up this USB flash drive with persistence so that changes that you make survive reboots. This is a Windows 11 laptop in previous videos I've shown you how to boot between Windows and Kali in other words enable dual booting of Kali and Windows but you may not want to do that you may want to run Kali off a USB flash drive so that no changes are made to the hard drive as an example on your laptop. Okay without further ado let me show you how to boot Kali off a USB flash drive but also enable persistence [Music] I'll insert the flash drive into my computer and to install Kali you need two pieces of software you need to download Kali which you can get from kali.org we are not going to download installer images or virtual machine and the other options what we're going to download here is the live boot image we don't want to install Kali on the laptop I showed you how to do that once again in a previous video we are going to download the live image it's about 3.8 gig in size the next piece of software you need is something to write that image to the USB drive there are multiple options to do this but in this example what I'll do is download Rufus so you can get the software from rufus.ie I'll scroll down and download the exe file to about 1.4 meg in size okay so it's a fairly simple process you need to download those two pieces of software I'm going to run Rufus the first thing you need to do is select your USB drive so I've got 128 gig USB flash drive here so I've selected that next thing I need to do is select the ISO image make sure that you choose the right image and this is the important part you want to set your persistent partition size you could set it up to a bigger amount but just for this example I'll set it to let's say 65 gig so half of the USB flash drive or approximately half of the USB flash drive you can give the volume a name I'm just going to leave it at the defaults Kali live so again choose your USB flash drive secondly specify the image to install so the live image and then you can click Start to start your installation we're told that all data will be removed so that's okay I'm going to click OK notice the USB flash drive is being formatted and then the installation will start now previously when I did this it took about 18 minutes to install this so now's a great time to go and get a coffee or do something else it's going to take a while for this to install through the power of editing we'll speed this process up basically you just need to wait for the installation to take place. foreign Okay there you go it's completed it took about 25 minutes and what we can do now is click close and reboot the computer now you've got two options really what I'm going to do here is restart the computer while holding the shift button down I'm going to click restart you don't have to do that what you could do instead of holding the shift button down while it reboots is just press the special key to reboot the computer into BIOS okay so there you go I can go to troubleshoot Advanced options UEFI firmware settings click restart to reboot the laptop into its BIOS now this is an Asus laptop so I could have used F2 as an example to boot it into BIOS that will really depend on your laptop but there you go I am in the BIOS utility now there's two important things that we want to do here the first thing is I want to move the boot priority to the USB thumb drive or USB drive and then Windows and the second thing I want to do is I want to go to Advanced mode here and go to security and turn off secure boot now the BIOS on computers is different you'll just have to go through the various settings to find those two options you want to disable secure Boot and you want to set the boot priority to the USB flash drive first and then Windows so I'll click exit and I'm going to save my changes and exit out of the BIOS so click OK and what that should do now is boot off the USB flash drive and allow me to boot into Kali Linux. I'm going to press the down arrow the option I'm looking for is a live system with USB persistence so I'm going to select that and press enter we want to have persistence once again so that settings are maintained for instance the Wi-Fi settings or a file that I add or other changes that I make to the system and there you go it's booted into Kali Linux I can see various applications here so it just looks like a standard Kali Linux installation but let's do something here what I'm going to do is open up the text editor and I'll just create a file called test so I'll save that to the desktop as an example and give the file a name called test and click save so this file now has been created on the desktop now what I could do is connect to a Wi-Fi network but I won't do that here I'll be able to prove persistency by rebooting the laptop and making sure that that test file still exists so what I'll do is restart the computer and hopefully now it'll boot back into Kali and I'll have my test file on the desktop. Okay so I'm going to go back to persistence so live system with USB persistence laptop is booting into Kali off the USB flash drive and there you go the test file with test in it is persistent in other words it survived the reboot now if I want to boot into Windows I can simply restart the laptop and then pull out the USB flash drive so I'll do that and hopefully it'll just boot into Windows now you could obviously press the right key to boot into BIOS and then boot into Windows that way but I've simply removed the flash drive from the computer and there you go I'm able to now Boot back into Windows if I want to boot back into Kali all I need to do is plug the USB drive back in and then say restart and then what I'll do is press F2 to get it to boot back into the USB drive so what I'll do in BIOS is simply move the boot priority to boot off the USB flash drive and then I'll save and exit and there you go I can select persistent USB drive once again and I've once again successfully booted back into Kali Linux okay I hope you've enjoyed this video I hope you found it useful very nice that you can boot Kali off a USB flash drive or dual booted whole bunch of options available with Kali Linux if you enjoyed this video please consider subscribing to my YouTube channel liking this video and clicking on the bell to get notifications I'm David Bombal and I want to wish you all the very best [Music]",

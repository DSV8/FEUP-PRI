    "transcript": "this is an rtx 3050 it is an eagle variant sent over by gigabyte and it is the loseriest rdx graphics card that you can buy today uh which made me think i wonder if the loseriest rtx graphics card can do the hardest rtx thing so let's see what it takes to get this rtx 3050 to do some ray tracing [Music] oh that is a nice futuristic looking eye on the box it's quite little look at that [Music] the whole card is just covered in this film of plastic oh yeah there we go that is a very interesting paint finish on the card i actually really like it it's kind of like a matte gray um it's definitely plastic but you know it is it is a relatively budget card i mean you know it's it's 20 22 so this is probably still gonna sell for eight thousand dollars on the used market but uh yeah it's a pretty good looking little card let's have a quick look at the specs of the new baby rtx graphics card the render config looks like this and as you can see it's got less gpu stuff in it than the previous runt of the rtx litter the 2060. interestingly the rtx 3050 has more video memory running 8 gigs of gtd r6 as opposed to 6 gigs of gddr6 although the memory bus is a bit smaller at 128 bit as opposed to 192 bit on the 2060. and according to tech powerups gpu tier list these hardware changes means that the rtx 3050 lags about 16 percent behind its beefier big brother with that there's just one more quick thing we have to have a look at before we throw the 3050 into the ray traced gauntlet as is tradition on this channel every time we have a graphics card we we just we have to take it apart and see what's going on underneath the cooler [Music] instead of a warranty void sticker they have a gigabyte qualified sticker which does that mean it will or won't catch on fire [Music] um i've been screwing for a while and this screw isn't coming undone the screw is fine so i think it's like a like a thread issue in the plastic uh because i i can't i can't get that screw on done the one has come undone but it oh okay that just kind of popped out like that yeah unfortunately you can't really see in there but there was definitely some kind of threading issue going on there you can actually see some unconsensual plastic debris still left on the screw anyway here is the bottom of the cooler which is a pretty standard lower end graphics card cooler you've got a single heat pipe going through that actually makes direct contact with the die and then you've got a whole bunch of thermal pad all over the place it seems like gigabyte is so scared of getting roasted for incomplete thermal pad coverage that they added thermal pads to spots where there are no modules for the pads to contact but you know that's that's going above and beyond i guess and here is the bear pcb which as you can see there's a whole bunch of space for higher-end versions of this eagle card there's even additional sets of solder points for more fans and rgb and stuff so yeah you can scale this pcb up uh but yeah with that let's actually clean off the thermal paste and have a closer look at an rtx 3050 dime and there is quite a theic die for a 50 series card it's a pretty big gpu with that let's put it back together and get into some ray tracing [Music] okay now we're starting off with quake 2 which i think may be the easiest game to run with ray tracing if i'm not mistaken uh we're currently running with it in opengl and you can see that we're steadily running at a thousand frames per second this is the smoothest thing i have ever seen oh there's a man it looks very different now it's much brighter actually like the environment is is much better lit and uh we've lost a whole bunch of frame rates but it's still running well i i think it would have been a really bad start if if this didn't run that would not have been a good sign at all but uh it's running fine but with that let's try something a bit more modern i've found that controls performance seems to not suffer that much when ray tracing is enabled although it's not super promising to start off with because here it's running just at high settings at 1080p with no ray tracing and we're hovering around 60 frames per second at the moment let's just go straight to high rate racing we're looking at just over half the frame rate we had before uh and that's with nothing going on in the scene we're not like fighting anyone or anything oh yeah it does not feel very good but luckily we do have a secret weapon in terms of ray tracing so let's see if turning on dlss helps much oh that feels way better and considering that normally control looks like it's rendered in a tub of vaseline it doesn't look much worse okay it's time for the original poster boy of rtx this is running at 1080p high settings it feels good this is this is nice this is a very solid gaming experience yeah so let's ruin it well i mean look it it's definitely reduced the frame rate and i would not recommend running it with ray tracing considering that i don't think i could really tell the difference straight off the bat uh but it's kind of it's working you know this is a very playable frame rate wow okay so let's see if we can push it harder uh but okay so it's all on ultra now as opposed to high oh see there's some there's some fire on our gun yes that's worth half the frame rate definitely oh yes my favorite disappointment cyberpunk here 1080p uh at medium-ish settings we're getting about 60 frames per second so it's it's very playable on this gpu so let's just be brave initially and crank it to psycho hell yeah let's see does it look better than it did before like maybe some of the lighting a little bit i don't know let's get in a car and drive around that usually completely breaks it oh yes no that is that is some primo gaming performance we've got right here i have an idea let's try and enable dlss maybe that helps a bit balanced oh that's made it that's made it much better now we're still sub 60 frames per second here but at least the game doesn't feel like it's being played via dial-up anymore although having said that at this point we haven't seen real performance carnage yet so let's take it to the next level let's try psycho ray tracing at 4k ah there we go that was that was more along the lines of what i was expecting in terms of in terms of gaming performance let's see if dlss can save this nightmare oh it still doesn't like that at all maybe ultra performance is better so at the moment we're running at 4k using psycho ray tracing with ultra performance dlss which i think is probably one of the dumbest game settings you can run cyberpunk in like i don't think i don't think you can go dumber than that uh but i mean it's kind of running it looks pretty good but i guess it's because the render resolution is essentially 1080p now the final game that we obviously need to test is turtle simulator remastered now i actually read on my google propaganda feed that it's been fixed they've done a bunch of patches and it runs way better so yeah let's also test that out here let me just get to a more sunny bit of the game because for some reason it doesn't seem to have cloud saves okay so at 1080p high settings we are struggling to stay in 60 frames per second it does touch it every now and then uh but it does look very beautiful now i'm gonna start off with performance and just see how much of a difference that makes but this is fine this is perfectly playable i think it's it's a bit input laggy honestly i actually wouldn't play it this way let's try very high they may actually have fixed the performance here because adding ray tracing hasn't had much of a negative effect although let's try crank it it's starting to struggle a little bit now but still it's kind of playable um whether or not it looks better now than it did without ray tracing on i i guess is up for debate although by looking at side by side footage i think how they fixed the performance impact was just make the setting not do anything because i can't tell a difference that went pretty well i was kind of expecting the graphics card to copiously soil itself like a small child getting on stage for the first time in front of its hard hard-ass ray-traced parents but that didn't happen although that being said uh there was still a reasonable performance impact uh with a lot of these games and in a bunch of them it was you couldn't tell it was on like in some of them i i genuinely thought that the settings didn't apply uh but they did you could tell because it was running a lot slower so even three ish years after the initial introduction of ray tracing it's still pretty dumb uh so hopefully three years from now maybe it'll be better i guess uh at least dlss is quite nice uh so yeah that brings me to the end of the video thank you very much for watching if you liked the video like and subscribe to the channel we are very close to 400 000 so if you can help push us over that edge that'll be really nice thank you and yeah until the next video thank you for watching bye [Music] you",

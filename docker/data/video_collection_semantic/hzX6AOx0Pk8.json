    "transcript": "- Hello and welcome. We're gonna look at some of the weirdest, most cursed key caps from Ali Express today. This is gonna be a weird one. So what we're gonna do today is, we have a whole bunch of keyboards and you can see, we are lovely blindfolded for-- - Lovely blindfolded? Matt. - [Matt] Yes. - Don't say like that. - What we're gonna do is, we're gonna have keyboards in front of us. We have to try and guess the theme of the key caps first. And then we're gonna be trying to type with those key caps. Now here's the catch. All of these have been bought from Ali Express, and they are some of the most cursed things on the internet. Can I get the first keyboard please? - Found it. - You found it? Okay. - Oh it's spiky. - Okay. Matt, you go first. - Oh. Oh. - What? Okay. It almost feels rubbery. - Like what is this? - Mm. - Those are beans. Oh, they're beans. - Oh, what the, okay, hang on. Hang on. That's a character. That's a character. Like a Pikachu or something? I feel some ears. - I definitely feel ears. - Yeah. Yeah. So the ears on that one. Ears. Oh, they all have ears. Oh, that's not good. - Also like, the amount I have to raise my finger. - I think this one's a Pikachu. I feel a tail and I feel a Pikachu like. - Oh, I feel tails. - Oh yeah. - Yeah. - Oh, I broke-- - Pokemon keyboard. - This is Pokemon keyboard. - I'm gonna say that. - I broke one. - I know exactly what this is. I am extremely confident in my answer. But Austin, I want you to go first because-- - Pokemon, I think it's Pokemon. - You're dead wrong. This is kittens, in teacups. - What? That's so specific. - No, there is. I, there's definitely a dog. I felt a Schnauzer. - You felt a Schnauzer? - I booped a snoop. All right, we're gonna take 'em off? - (together) Three, two, one. - Oh, they're ninja cats. They're all Naruto. - Naruto cats. You have cats in teacups. You have paws. You got Garfield. - But why is there Garfield? - He's a cat. - Can I just ask a really dumb question? I think it's gonna set the tone for the rest of the video. Why? - Look, if you shake it, they jiggle. They jiggle. - They jiggle. - Matt, lots of things shake - when you jiggle. I'm at a loss for words, and that's a rare thing for me. - How much do you think all of key caps cost? - Oh, no. - And I've been like-- - I'm gonna say $75 for all the key caps we see here. - I'm gonna say $42 - And 17 cents. - For all of them? - For all of them. - That would be very affordable. - This is from Ali Express, remember. The land of affordability. - So, Austin was spot on for the subtotal of these. They were, it was like 75.97, but Matt was weirdly spot on for how much shipping cost. It came out to 103. Matt gets the point for guessing the theme. - Yeah. And I get the point for the price. - Now the, the, the tiebreaker is typing. - Also, I just realized that I am not gonna be able to type at all. Because these are so randomly placed. - I'm gonna lose my-- - Yeah. Yeah. - I'm gonna be like zero words per minute. - We are gonna, we are gonna compete. - Okay. All right, go ahead. - Ready? - Nope. This is not good. I don't like this at all. - Uh, yeah. You're getting about one out of every three letters, right? - That's it. - Four words per minute. - I got four per minute. - With a 45% accuracy. Okay. - All right. Ready? Set. Be great. - Oh my God. Oh my God. - Matt. You have to at least get one word right. - For the record, you did not get any words right. - I did. I got run the tape back, Erin. Run the tape back. - Zero. - Zero with a 20% accuracy. - I think I win this round. I think I win this round. I'm just gonna blindfold myself. Cause I don't wanna see what comes next. - Put it close to us so we can hold hands. - We're gonna do it dirty now with the next one here. All right. What do we got? That's your hand? Oh, oh. - What are we feeling right now? Oh, it's good. So it's a little, it's a little baby one. It's a little baby one. What are we feeling right now? - The eye of saruman? - Wait, what'd you say? Saruman? - Off brand. It's from Ali Express. (laughing) - There's no name brand stuff going from Ali Express. - Okay. Hang on. So one key feels like maybe like an eye or something. So I feel like round bit in the middle, and like some spiky bits. Whatever this is, what is this? - It is, it is spiky, confusing me. I like, are you sniffing? - Yeah. - So, okay. So I feel some like fabricy thing here. I am gonna be a hundred percent wrong on this one. - I'm gonna say this is the snitch from Harry Potter. The cloth is wings. - Oh yeah. Yeah. There are definitely wings. You're right. Cuz there's like there's four wings down here. - See, now you get the advantage because I just gave you the answer. - Exactly. Thanks. Is it Navi from Zelda? - You want to know what this is? I don't know what this is. According to Ali Express, it is DIY personalized key cap. Beautiful girl, angel wing pink. Cute key cap. Mechanical keyboard, kid toys. Animation. - Oh man. I can't believe, I didn't guess that. How much does something like this cost? - For just these key cap? I'm gonna say these were $4.32. - I'm gonna say $15. Cause I'm gonna include shipping in this. - I would say that Matt is closer. Cuz they were like they were like two bucks, and then four bucks shipping. - Wow. It's actually pretty affordable. Wait, so Matt who's winning right now? You're winning right now. - Right? - I'm winning right now. - No, no, no. We're tied. Cause I won one and you won. - But I won more things. - What? I won two of the first three, and then you won one of the-- - But they're weighted more because there's only two - Criteria for this last one-- - You can't say that you're winning because you're weighted more. That's not fair. - Are you calling me fat? - Oh, okay. What is happening here? Matt, I like the big one. - Where's the big one? - Touch the big one. - Touch the big one with me - I can't! You're touching it. - Touch it together. There you go. Right there. Whoa. Whoa, whoa. What is this? This one's huge. Touch it with me, Matt. - It's girthy. - I don't. This is the biggest key cap I've ever felt in my life. It's gotta be like a fish or something. - What theme are you going with? - I'm gonna go with the ocean. - Is the theme. - The ocean? - Yeah. - This feels like nine tails. This big one. - Oh this one, I just realized this one has feet. Oh, I I've made a grave mistake - If this one's nine tails. I get like 12 points. - Ah. - Vulpix. Vulpix. - Matt, I'll give you this one. So we got a Gengar. We got a Kirby. We got a Cubone skull. Very dark. Oh that's the big blobby boy. His feet touched the other two keys. - Gengar. Is he about to lick me? I love the Kirbys. I am offended that there's no Rick's. - Rick is not a real thing. - Yes he is. - Rick doesn't exist. - Yes he does. - He's a figment of your imagination. - I'm gonna say this is $137 - No, no. - And 43 cents include with, that's that's with shipping. - I wanna say $85. - Matt. You are literally $3 off. $134. - And I'm just killing it and I'm-- - Let's see you kill it at typing then my friend. Can you get one word? Can you get one word? Nope. You can't get one word. - You can't because this types five letters. - Well, you're just not a good typist. - Bam. - You got a word. - I got two. I got two. All these, all these stupid key caps. Hit other keys. - Two words baby. Let's go. - No. - Okay. - How many words did I get? - Five. - I think I get the point for this one, right? - I've already won. - What do you mean you've already won? - Mathematically, I've already won. - Matt. Do you know what you need right now? - What do I need right now? - Put your hand out. Put your hand out. - It is. - More, more out. There we go. Okay. We are gonna continue to hold hands until you subscribe to the channel - Ring a ling a ding-- - Do you know what holding - Hands is? (laughing) - Whoa, okay. So we got a big wrist rest. - This is painfully sharp. - It is quite sharp. Also like what's this like cup thing? Like I'm just like, what am I doing here right now? Okay. I've just taken it off. Okay. - So taking it off. - What is this? - I'm not like getting a lot of ideas on this one. - This is impossible. I have absolutely no idea. Okay. So this one's sharp, right? This one's sharp. - Yeah. - This one's got like a big dimple in it which I just I'm gonna keep putting my finger into. - Do they connect? - No, they don't. The bottom row feels like, just weird and bumpy to me. - Oh this, oh this one. - But it doesn't like, it doesn't feel like anything. Particularly. - What? - Matt, you okay? - This is a face. - What? - Is this anthropomorphized food? I'm gonna say food with faces. - That's wrong. I feel very confident that that is wrong. - This is ears. Here's a, here's a boop. I'm booping this snoot. - I'm gonna say drinks or foody things. - Three, two, one. - Oh. - Ah! - Oh my God. Matt. Are you actually kidding me right now? So cheese, waffles. - The cheese. - Donuts, the cheese. Now that I feel, it makes a lot of sense. In the moment, I could not figure it out. But if I literally would've like dug my finger in there, it makes a lot more sense. - Kenzie who gets the point on this one? - I'm giving you the point because you got like every point you were like it's dessert. It's drinks. It's food. That's all. - But I got, I got the snoot. - I'll tell you first guess at it. Because I'm bold and adventurous like that. I'm gonna say all of these key caps cost $53. - $122.07 with shipping. - What is wrong with you Matt? - We have licensed characters. - They're not licensed. I guarantee you. They're not licensed. - Off of Ali Express? - Yeah, but. - Subtotal, 101. Total, 134. - I'll be honest. I didn't even feel the cheese. I feel like I've been training my entire life for these three key caps, and I didn't even feel 'em. All right. Ready? - I am. All right. This one might be a little easier because even though some of them are big, none of these key caps will press multiple keys. So I think I might get a few words. - It's not working. - It's not working, great. - The keyboard itself is just not working. - Oh, so we can't type on it. - I win the point. - What? - Austin wins! - What? - If we add up these points, Matt's still winning. - I think the points don't matter. And all that matters is that you subscribe to this is and the ringaling the dingaling button. - Well, wait a minute. We still got one more. - What? - Because I wanted to get in on the fun. I made my own keyboard for your viewing pleasure. We won't need this anymore. - What do you mean, viewing pleasure? - I want you to have some finger bliss of my own. - We're just gonna go ahead, - What? - and clear this off. Before we get too far, we're gonna need to prepare for a second. - Oh, why is there plastic? I don't like the pla-- Why is there? Well, why? Why is there plastic? What? Wait. What's the, what's the, oh, what is that smell? What is that smell? I don't like that smell. - You love to smell things. I wanted to get it on the fun. So I created him my own keyboard. And I think I created the most authentic, - true to form, for your-- - No. - -- Finger pleasure. - No, this smells horrible. I'm gonna-- - I'll get it, I'll get it a little closer to you. - Fingers are about to descend and they may be stuck forever. Ah! Ah! I touched it. Is it whipped cream? Ah. That, no. It's so cold. Oh God. What is this right now? What am I holding? Wait, I can taste this. - You shouldn't have, you should not have tasted that. Stop licking the keyboard. - Is it cherries? - It is authentic, cherry key caps. - Oh my God. What the? What the fuck? (laughing) - So. - These cherry switches taste delicious. If this isn't worth you subscribing to This is and ringling the dingling button then I don't really know what we're doing here. - Thank you for watching. - Let us know what another keyboard-- - It's in my nose. - --you want us to fruitify and-- - It's in my nose right now. I've got keyboard in my nose.",

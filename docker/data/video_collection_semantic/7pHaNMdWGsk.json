    "description": "The question, can a machine be made to think like a person? has always been tied to strategy games. Games, with their clear rules and obvious winners and losers, were perfect proving grounds for early computer scientists, who could break them down into clearly defined problem sets. Audiences could marvel at the progress of man vs machine face offs, even if they didnt fully understand the underlying technology.  The earliest AI game systems relied on a brute force, top-down approach: programmers downloaded every possible outcome into their AI systems, which were built around narrowly defined, rule-based criteria. In the 1950s, the earliest versions of neural networks and machine learning arrived. This represented a shift towards bottom-up programming, systems designed to determine the probability of various outcomes based on training data. One early system, a virtual rat solving a maze, was made up of vacuum tubes, motors, and clutches. As the rat navigated, the machine learned and shifted probabilities.  IBM debuted their first AI Grand Challenge  a multi-year effort meant to push the limits of artificial intelligence  in 1997. Deep Blue beat reigning chess world champion Gary Kasparov, and was seen as the final triumph for the top-down approach. In the last decade, advances in machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing paved the way for AIs like Watson on Jeopardy!, AlphaGo, and Dota 2increasingly complex systems that still existed within the framework of games.

    "transcript": "- Another big milestone for AI, a competition between a former debating world champion and a computer. - So many people are here working on this production. - Many of the previous demonstrations that we have seen were the realm of games. And games have very well defined set of rules. - You could do simple things like play games, but you couldn't do complex things like having a debate. - There is so many things that are connected together and so many things need to work smoothly. I am actually a bit stressed. I feel the team didn't have enough time to practice. - So I have to ask you, who do you thinks going to win tonight? - Well I'm partial today of course. What we really want is to create systems that work with us so that we can make better decisions. - Ladies and gentlemen, here we go, Project Debater. - Greetings, Harish. I suspect you've never debated a machine. Welcome to the future. - I started my amateur debating career back in high school. The teacher for history made the mistake of returning the exams and saying if you want to appeal about your score, I'm willing to hear your thoughts. And obviously nobody seriously considered to do that except me. Okay I understand if you think that this is my score. I have a different view. Let's argue about that, in writing. Later on I started to think about writing, you know comedy sketches. I started to develop a sitcom called Puzzle. Oddly enough, the final episode of that sitcom is entirely focused on competitive debates. They filmed 16 episodes and it was a complete failure. This is how I found myself doing computer science and artificial intelligence. - For centuries, people have always saw the games as a great way to measure your intelligence. When I play chess, I want to prove to myself I'm smarter than the other side. If you take the position that you have to hand code a rule for every situation, it is insanely hard. What we now do is you give them examples, and they'll learn from those examples and make their own rules compared to having to craft all the rules by hand. - Games have been important for AI but games differ from debate because the classical game is a set of equations that's fully understood. You can draw the rules of chance. You cannot draw the rules of conversation, that's impossible. - Just a couple of days after the Jeopardy! event, an email was sent to the entire research division asking us what should be the next era grand challenge. I was intrigued so I offered my office mate at the time to spend an hour and brainstorm together. And towards the end of the hour at some point I suggested this notion of developing a machine that will be able to debate humans. So we submitted the proposal in a single slide. They told us this is impossible and this is not a very good plan. - I think this is a characteristic of a grand challenge because if it is very clear to you that this is doable, then probably this is not a grand challenge. And if it is very clear to you that this is not doable, then probably you shouldn't start. It should be somewhere in between but you need to take into consideration that perhaps you will fail. - I didn't hear anything for a few months. Then, February 2012, Hayah Sofail used this chat service in IBM to text me. And she said, \"Did you hear?\" And I said, \"No, what?\" And she said, \"It was selected, Debater was selected as the next grand challenge.\" I was very excited and I wrote her back, \"I want to thank you for all the support along the way.\" And she said, \"Don't thank me yet.\" (laughs) - I'm Harish Natarajan, and my debating record is that I won the European Championships in 2012, the Oxford Intervarsity and the Cambridge Intervarsity. I've twice won the largest open tournament in the world, the LSE Open. And certainly, even if I'm not necessarily the best debater in the world, I'll certainly be very high up most people's list. What I think debating forces you to do is you just have to defend and justify your own opinions, but defend and justify often the very opposite opinions as well. And I think that process is so valuable because I think it makes us interrogate the beliefs and the views which we hold. - One of the things that happens when you take a grand challenge is that you have to slice it up into questions that each of them is less grand. From the beginning, one thing you would need is a massive collection of newspaper and journal articles on the order of 10 billion sentences. - Then the Debater system needed capability of being able to automatically identify the exact boundaries of the claim within the billions of sentences. - And figure out if those arguments are supporting your side of the debate or the other side. - This is something that is very easy for humans to do based on our knowledge about concepts in the world. And it is very complicated for machines to do. Now you need to arrange a meaningful narrative. - After the opening statement, now there's rebuttal speech. - This is being able to listen to an opponent and respond accordingly. - Those were the main challenges that we had in front of us. - And if one of these steps is not working properly, you will end up with a useless speech. After we were selected, it was very hard for us to make significant progress. Only four months after we started to work, for the topic physical education should be mandatory in high school, the Debater system detects the following claim in Wikipedia: \"Several studies have shown that lizards display no benefit from exercise.\" This is going to sound ridiculous, okay? They're going to ask us about physical exercise, whether this should be mandatory or not, and how are we going to understand that these claims are actually referring to lizards and not to high school students? It will be very hard to get even close to a meaningful debate between this system and an expert human debater. - First time I heard about Project Debater was one of those small articles probably back in 2014 where they talked about this Debating Watson Project. And at the time it certainly seemed like a pipe dream. Humans are rarely just convinced by evidence and logical rational argument. It's about really connecting with them in one of many different ways, some of which aren't as rational as others. - What I do is I coach debaters and I tell them this is what you need to do in order to improve. And usually a human debater, it just kind of, their brain understands what I'm saying and they can convert that into being a better debater. Sometimes not, but usually. And in this case, I am saying it to the programmers and they're saying okay how do we take that learning process that happens inside people's heads and convert that into some sort of algorithm? And that's really where the magic happens. - It seems to me that this is a motion that basically for the government it's impossible to defend. - Well you can agree in general that you'd defend, like any negative aspects to begin with. - What I'm saying is that if you will debate me, not as an expert debater, I will make this point. Is there an answer to that? - Being able to show to the world that you can take a computer program and teach it not just to play a game that has very specific set of rules and very specific ways of winning but something that is so, so difficult for humans to learn and so subjective in how you see it and how you hear arguments and how you respond to arguments. I think that that's, it's incredible. When I joined the team, it was not at a level where it would be competitive. - My automatic analysis indicates that Yara suggested that the abolition of the entire fossil fuel field is going to create and the traumatic effects of that and lastly, however considering relevant data suggests some information that may contradict this claim. - I first heard about IBM Debater because they were asking for volunteers to record speeches for them. Basically, they wanted to build up this database of speeches from people with a lot of debating experience and then train the computer using that database. - I think at first, Project Debater would sometimes give arguments that weren't necessarily for its side. - Such mandatory minimum sentences lead to overcrowded prisons and rightfully so. These were the main points I wanted to raise. - The types of arguments, the connections between arguments, the way that we sometimes tell jokes or sometimes we're more serious, those are all things that they pulled in for Project Debater. - I often compare Project Debater to my kids and their development because I guess my oldest was born about the same time the program was born. In terms of personality, they'd be I guess on par. My seven year old has a great personality, they do develop that quite early. It's scary but also nice to see that Project Debater is developing a personality as well. - I don't know whether to call my opponent naive, old fashioned or just a romantic. But this way or that, my opponent is wrong. - I remember the Debater, she called him naive and it was really hurt. Suddenly he's laughed at not only by a machine, but the audience are now bursting out laughing. My name is Assaf Gavron, I'm an author most of the days. I'm in charge of writing what we call generic texts. Little bits and little phrases that are put together by the software. Metaphors or quotes, opening sentences, jokes. We had a lot of discussions about who is Debater? - My friend, you are speaking at the extremely fast rate of 203 words per minute. Don't hurry, we have plenty of time. Please slow down and present your arguments calmly. - We never write the texts to a specific debate. We don't know what the debate will be. No, the magic of Debater is that it can argue on any topic thrown at it under the sun. So we write a general text that could fit some topics and then the system has to identify them and use the right ones in the right time. - Climate change is what allows them to poison the minds of young kids. - Science, we know the earth is warming. Will there be more droughts? Yes. - How definitive is the evidence? Is there any room for debate? - This is the Natasha Hall Show, on CJAD800. - We are speaking with Dr. Aharanoff, she is the global manager for IBM's artificial intelligence Project Debater, thanks for being here. How nuts is that it could take artificial intelligence to teach us to understand other human perspectives better? - I think that's where AI should be going. - Why? Why do we need robots to teach us how to debate? - Ultimately making a decision involves how you weigh your different values. It's not all about information and I think that AI is not gonna do for you. But it can give you all the information so you can make a better decision. You caught me in one of the most tense days ever. I'm flying in three days. Obviously we had a bug that we found last week, naturally. You see results that are just not consistent. You say I'm gonna run this tomorrow, I'm gonna get a different result, and you have no idea where it came from. It was really what's called a ghost bug, it just didn't make any sense at all. This was testing how much we can stretch our nerves. So that was fixed by a patch to Java and then we had to rerun everything and go from there. But it's fixed. - Every time I try to select it. - Test again. - We're gonna just play something constant and I'll bring it in slowly. - It's a single debate. It's just one debate, so in a single debate, many things can happen. And Harish is a much better debater than any debater we faced in the past. - Let me introduce John Donvan. (crowd applauds) - I host a debate program, Intelligence Squared US. Our goal has always been to raise the level of public discourse. This truly is a first for us. The first time that an artificial intelligence, namely Project Debater will be on our stage arguing with a human being. And may the best debater win. So let's get started, let's first meet and applaud our debaters first, arguing for the resolution tonight will be IBM Project Debater. Representing the rest of us, please come to the stage, Harish. So, to reveal now the resolution of the evening is this. We should subsidize pre-school. We should subsidize pre-school. We are going to ask you to vote before and after the arguments using your mobile phone to tell us where you stand on this position and to tell us whether you were persuaded or not persuaded by one side or the other. Project Debater actually has a gender. She will be arguing-- (crowd applauds) She will be arguing for the resolution, ladies and gentlemen, here we go, Project Debater. - Greetings, Harish. I have heard you hold the world record in debate competition wins against humans. But I suspect you've never debated a machine. Welcome to the future. I will argue that we should subsidize pre-schools. For decades, research has demonstrated that high quality pre-school is one of the best investments of public dollars, resulting in children who fare better on tests and have more successful lives than those without the same access. In December 2015, researchers at Duke University found that students who enroll in pre-school are 39% less likely to be placed in special education programs. A statistical summary of studies by the National Institute for Early Education Research found that high quality pre-school can create long-term academic and social benefits for individuals and society, far exceeding costs. While I cannot experience poverty directly, and have no complaints concerning my own standards of living, I still have the following to share. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that universal full day pre-school creates significant economic savings in healthcare, as well as decreased crime, welfare dependence, and child abuse. Why don't we examine the evidence and the data and decide accordingly? Thank you for listening. (crowd applauds) - Well thank you very much, everybody. It's a pleasure to be here for this historic event. There was a lot of information in that speech, and lots of facts and lots of figures. The problem though is the reality of subsidizing pre-schools is one which does not deal with the underlying problems in society. I'm not sure if you massively increase the number of people going to pre-school they're all going to be the ones going to the high quality pre-schools. - Mr. Natarajan suggested that pre-schools should not be subsidized because this will reduce their quality. If anything, the opposite is true. One of many reasons is that subsidizing attracts more skilled and qualified people to the field, improving the quality of pre-schools for all. Pre-school is pushing that child to learn in a competitive environment at the age of three or four, when you realize you aren't necessarily as talented as someone else. That creates psychological damage for many children may mean that pre-school is actively harmful. - My opponent claimed that pre-schools are harmful. I believe my argument suggested that the benefits outweigh the potential disadvantages. - You cannot fund everything. I think this is simply empirically true and you have to make choices and you have to make trade-offs. Many middle class parents and many people from upper incomes already send their children to pre-school. You are taking money from all taxpayers to help those individuals who are already often the best off. To be clear, my intention is not to leave a suitcase full of money for everyone to grab at will. We are talking about a limited, targeted and helpful mechanism. - I don't think that Project Debater has helped those individuals she identifies as the most important, but in reality has hurt them. - Thank you and that concludes round three and the argument phase of this debate. (crowd applauds) We're on our way to making history here. We would like to ask you now to complete that process by using your phones and choose your position where you stand now that you've heard the arguments from both sides. At Intelligence Squared, we deliver victory to the side whose numbers have moved up the most in percentage point terms. Harish Natarajan, his first vote was 13%, his second vote was 30%. He pulled up 17 percentage points. That is it, Harish Natarajan arguing against the resolution subsidized pre-school declared our winner, our congratulations to them. Oh, and we have the second vote. Which of the two debaters better enriched your knowledge? Let's see what that number is. Project Debater better enriched the knowledge of the audience on that side, so, a little bit of a split decision. (crowd applauds) This is amazing. And I think regardless, we made history tonight because Project Debater held her own. - It's fine to disagree. It is not fine not to listen and not to really try to understand the other side. We see artificial intelligence technologies everywhere. We use that in our cars, and we use that to select music, and we use that when we try to buy something. What about discussions between us? - Thanks for joining here in Geneva for the AI for Good Global Summit 2019. - I think the Debater is really just the beginning. It touches on a very fundamental problem, understanding the pros and cons for taking better decisions. So for example a government which is considering a policy and the citizens that are going to be affected by this policy. I don't think it will replace the decision makers but it will help them. - (speaks in foreign language) - Greetings all, the citizens of Lugano have contributed more than 1,000 arguments in support of the claim that we should further explore the development of autonomous vehicles. The following is a summary of their thoughts. The crowd raised four issues. The first we'll demonstrate how autonomous cars reduce accidents. Another point is that autonomous cars can help elderly people. Then the topics of autonomy--",

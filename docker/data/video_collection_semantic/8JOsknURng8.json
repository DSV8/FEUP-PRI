    "transcript": "the year is 2318 a weary traveler has braved the hell skin that is post-apocalyptic Vancouver for a rumored stash of still functioning gaming Hardware a come on I hiked 3 months to get to that I mean I could plug that graphics card into it which I guess would make the bot parasites kind of worth it [Music] but first a sponsor to help offset those Scavenging costs today's video is sponsored by be quiet's new dark Rock Pro 5 or if you're feeling real elite the dark Rock Elite both coolers are rated for over 250 watts of TDP come with easy installation and you can even slip the middle fan in which I really like both coolers also come with excellent Ram clearance for such ginormous beings and with the elite you get just a splash of tasteful RGB check out the bqu dark Rock Pro 5 and Elite using the link in the video description now before we go about trying to figure out how to even strap a graphics card to what is essentially your granny's all-in-one let's have a look at the graphics card we dug out of a post-apocalyptic Denny's parking lot I found an RX 7700 XT a graphics card that I think will pair very well with the Pentium gold in the granny Metron the kind of CPU to bottleneck its own [Music] igpu ooh there is some pretty obvious plastic molding issues on this front but you're not going to see that bit mostly I guess from this angle looks pretty good in terms of specs we've got 12 gigs of video memory we've you've got a pretty standard modern graphics card IO the cooler is gigantic and Airy I'm sure with the GPU running at like 20% utilization it's going to have its work cut out for it and then we have this metal back plate this is not the worst graphics card to find in a post-apocalyptic pile of suffering so now that we've met the exciting RX 7700 XT it's time to rip the back off the granny PC and see if we can make the two mate [Music] somehow now comes one of the worst device tear down processes I've ever experienced hopefully I kind of softened it up last time but if anything the previous tear down just enraged the granny matron cuz it was putting up more of a fight this time oh oh that does not want to let go it just popped out last time why was [Applause] [Music] that Jus I hate that process so much now a lot of you are probably thinking how am I going to plug a graphics card into here there's clearly no space you idiot but I have a really good idea about how that's going to work first let's get this kind of cod piece thing off and I'll show [Music] you now clearly there's no 16x pcie slot for us to plug a graphics card in with but what we do have is an m.2 slot over here and the like weird Wi-Fi version of the m.2 slot which is where this little device comes in which I've actually used in a video before for a very similar use case to this you just take this little guy and then plug it into oh there's a difference between an m.2 y oh oh and that's the moment I learned that mini pcie and m.2 Wifi are in fact different [Music] connectors so it's been several days and we finally got all the accessories we need to plug a graphics card into the system in various interesting ways the first adapter I'm going to try should let me plug a mini PCI device into an m.2 Wi-Fi [Music] slot cool so we've got a thing now sitting in a place that we wanted to so now I can hopefully connect that adapter up to this oh I'm going to have to shift the standoffs closer wait they're soldered down what what is the point of having multiple standoff locations but then soldering the default position down anyway it's fine we can fix this yeah it's nothing a b a doct tape won't fix yeah I don't see anything wrong with that I've just noticed a pretty big problem uh the stand for the monitor can only Mount to this plate and I can't Mount this plate back because that cable like it doesn't go past this bit of the yeah so I'm kind of thinking my best bet here is to just use this line open face down on the table like that with an external monitor plugged into the graphics [Music] card nice this is starting to really look like something dug out of a post-apocalyptic pile we flip the power on for the graphics card that's the power button a few moments later okay we're not getting a signal out this is probably a really bad idea but I kind of want to see what this the display on the things doing I mean this display is doing stuff but even device manager isn't reading the graphics card it's like it's not plugged in so I guess we've got to try a different adapter I don't know this one seems pretty janky because well this which leads to like a sa power connector is the only thing that's giving the GPU any power through the pcie connector that's all that gives the the pcie slot power but as far as I understand it it is keyed for both forms of m.2 slot so let's try the wifi m.2 [Music] first that looks fine I think I don't know let me just tape the connector down cuz the screws don't align for some reason but despite a very professional looking setup this adapter didn't work either it's not detecting it again so I think the issue is the p for so we are going to have to sacrifice the windows m.2 drive but after swapping in some SATA storage to free up the m.2 slot I ran into a different problem it doesn't work for both oh bother that is not good apparently it wasn't keyed for m.2 and the final adapter I bought for m.2 to miniat wouldn't fit in the m.2 slot because the ethernet port was blocking it okay so we're we're going back to the other adapter now but that oh that also doesn't fit and just like that I had to head back to Amazon to order more of these stupid adapters so this is adapter 17 at this point which just shows that this isn't a very good post-apocalyptic gaming setup idea cuz you're not going to find 17 different versions of this adapter just lying around are you but maybe this is the one that works let's see straight off the bat this one looks more promising cuz it takes actual power for the PCI slot and then you've got this little mini HDMI looking connector that plugs into this one that then sits in the m.2 slot and then you connect them using this cable that smells strongly of industrial cleaning chemicals this one also needs to be taped [Music] down I guess it doesn't seem any more precarious than any of the previous implementations although this one somehow feels quite promising a few moments later never mind that also didn't work I just have one left so I'm kind of quickly running out of options and just like that the fate of gaming in the apocalypse rests on your shoulders young adapter if you fail like those before you with you dies Our Hope of dis associating from the apocalypse and the butt parasites would have been super not worth it oh it it does though and not only did device manager register it amd's drivers did as well and once I was finished shouting about why it always takes me 17 attempts to get anything to work I was ready to do some gaming ooh with Battlefield 5 at 1080p High settings our little Pentium is pretty spicy we're getting about 60 frames per second granted there's not a lot of GPU utilization happening but that is keeping the power draw down which would make it much easier to run off a diesel generator it also helps to pretend that with a proper CPU this GPU doesn't get over 200 frames per second whoo again it seems like post-apocalyptic gaming isn't going to be that bad I mean granted the 7700 XD is being wildly underutilized and we did drop to about 20 frames per second then there uh but this is not the kind of bottlenecking I'm used to this Pentium gold is doing really well I mean I'm I'm used to just half of the game not loading ever oh oh things oh things fell apart there quite quickly speaking of things not loading in properly look at that GTA 5 has met the minimum requirement for playability holy crap look at how starfields running on the little Pentium gold I was going to say d uh it's almost like this game's based on an 800-year old engine oh yeah see that that that's the issue with the Starfield performance that doesn't dump you out of the immersion immediately at all loading times are a real limitation of the little granny matron especially the last of us which took a solid 45 minutes to load in wow that took an obscene amount of time to load I was worried if the actual apocalypse was going to happen in the meantime uh but now that we're finally into the last of us as you can see from the frame time graph there's there's a lot of terrible things going on you kind of want that to just be a smooth line and it shouldn't look like it's mapping out an earthquake having said that this is a pretty good combination of Hardware to dig out of a radioactive pile and it should be a great if stuttery distraction from all the dentry you're definitely going to have which actually reminds me of a study I recently read about how David Do's Tech off subscribers will have 13% less violent dysentery if an apocalypse does happen just keep that in mind until the next video and until then [Music] bye-bye",

    "transcript": "Robo Taxis....where are they at, and when will they get here? And more importantly, how do they work from the inside? This video is sponsored by Intel and Mobileye, and together we're going to answer all those questions. Let's get started. [Intro] When we talk about autonomous driving, it's important to know the levels of self driving. This is a scale that's used around the world. Level 0 would be, you know, just you driving your own vehicle. Level 1 would be driving your own vehicle with something like cruise control. Level 2 is when it starts to get some brake assist and steering assist, you know, stuff that can stay between the lanes. And level 3 is where you might be able to take your eyes off the road for short periods of time, but the car still needs a lot of input from the driver. The driver is still very much involved with the process. Level 4 driving is where the car can handle pretty much every situation by itself, you know, really good for routine driving. But the driver can still take over if they wanted to and drive it themselves. Level 5 is where we start seeing disappearing steering wheels because the car don't need no driver. It's been said that the safest driver is one that never gets behind the wheel, which is a little depressing, but the NHTSA has said that 94% of automotive accidents have happened because of human error. We don't have a very good track record of being perfect as a species. Computers, on the other hand, are far better at not making human mistakes, and that's where Robo Taxis and Intel come into play. This guy behind me is a fully electric Mobileye Robo Taxi that people will be able to ride in as early as next year. Fully capable of autonomous level 4 driving. Taxis aren't yellow anymore, they are going to be this color and super high tech. And let me show you how it works. Let's see what it would be like to get inside. I think it's going to be absolutely crazy when you can call a cab, shows up driverless, you get inside and it takes you to your destination by itself. I'm going to show you what that's really like in a second. This vehicle is still a level 4, so obviously we have the steering wheel as well as the accelerator and brake pedal and, you know, the map in the center. Mobileye is an Intel company and currently has it's driver assistance technologies in over 88 million vehicles. And this baby is at the pinnacle with all the bells and whistles. It's got 11 high resolution cameras around the outside that give it a very detailed look at the environment. And this camera system is just one of the two redundant layers of protection. The second layer is a long range lidar system, and short range flash lidars on the side, along with radar. Each of these layers work independently of each other. Extra fail safes for super safe driving. They call all the tech on the top a Manta Ray unit. Personally, I think it looks a little more like a mohawk. But what do I know about hair. You might be asking yourself, 'Hey Jerry, what happens if the exterior cameras get dirty, or if it's raining?' Well lucky for us, Mobileye has already thought of that. Each of these cameras come with a little water nozzle as well as a little air nozzle so that it can use water and air to clean off each of these little lenses at the same time. Each of the little cameras mounted around the vehicle will have its own water and air cleaning system, as you can see from right here, this little lip above it and down here. As of right now, these Robo Taxis are scheduled to go live here in Munich, Germany next year. Thanks to Intel's partnership with Sixt. You'll just hail this taxi on the Move It app, just like you would any other rideshare. All of the computing power for the automated driving can be found back here. Yeah we have plenty of cargo space, and where are the computers? They are right down here. This is what it takes to run the lidars, radar, and all the cameras around the exterior of the vehicle. And it looks like this thing is even water cooled. You're probably asking yourself, how does a robo taxi even work? How does it do all that automated driving stuff? That, my friend, is a great question. Let me show you. Behind me is Mobileye's development vehicle and it's equipped with those same cameras on the top and around the sides. They can be installed on any vehicle and this is going to be our self-driving taxi around Munich today. This is just the development vehicle obviously. It does not have the lidar sensor up top. But since it has all the cameras we can still see exactly what the computer is thinking while it's driving us around. As always, I'll be testing it out first so you can know what to expect. So right now the driver is not touching the steering wheel or using the accelerator or brake pedals. This is the map right here as you can see. This map has been generated from the millions of Mobileye equipped vehicles, kind of like a crowdsourced map. Right now we are going to make an unprotected left turn, and the computer using these cameras in the front can see that bus that's across the lane, as well as the pedestrians that are walking along next to us. Having all those cameras on top for the 360 view, there they are over there, is very helpful. So now it can tell that the light has turned green. We're waiting for the bus to pass us, or turn. The car is analyzing the situation with all of these cars coming and color codes them so it can know which ones are threats and which ones we can go in front of. Obviously we're not going to go in front of this guy. Very smart move. The computer thinks it's safe. [Laughing] It is self-driving us down the next road. Back to the color coding. It is changing the color of all these cars as it analyzes the drive that we're doing. And this is obviously the consumer facing screen which is what you'll see while driving in the taxi. But Mobileye has allowed us to get a behind the scenes look at exactly what the computer is thinking. So as the car is driving, this is the display that the computer is seeing, and it can tell where we're going as well as analyzing every single object in the frame. It can figure out which vehicles are stationary, which vehicles are moving, and where the pedestrians might end up being as we're driving along. This blue line right here is where the car thinks that it's able to drive. It's the edge of the free space. Obviously it knows we can't drive into these buses. Obviously when humans are driving our brains are doing the exact same thing so it's super cool to see in real life the computer doing the same things our brain is. You might be wondering why Intel is so invested in this automated driving technology, and that's because cars are turning into computers with wheels. At the moment in 2019, computer chips and semiconductors make up about 4% of a vehicle's bill of materials, you know, when they are building it. In 2030 though, it's estimated that semiconductors will make up about 20% of a vehicle's bill of materials. So it makes sense for one of the largest computer companies to jump into the computers on wheels marketplace. So while we're driving this is the ideal path that we're taking. The car is analyzing the maps that have been crowd sourced from all the other Mobileyes vehicles, and it knows that we want to get onto the freeway. Still not driving, it can see that our light is red. Let's wait for it to turn green for a second. It's analyzing the risk of the cars coming our direction. Still knows the light is red though. And it's using the three perspectives from the three different cameras up here on the windshield to get all this information. Light is green and now we are going to merge onto the freeway or the highway. There we go. A perfect merge onto the freeway without even touching the wheel. As you can see here on the display, a car, and this was not planned, a car merged into our lane while we were driving. And our car, without any input from us, honked at the other car, asserting, you know, dominance. Right now we are merging into traffic all by itself. You can see the desired lane location here. We've seen some pedestrians walking on the road in front of us. Very nice. And it is analyzing this whole intersection seeing everything that's going on. So we've noticed the car in front of us has it's flashers on just kind of parked in the middle of the road. Let's see what our car decides to do with this information. And now we've successfully merged into the other lane while analyzing our situation. That's what we call problem solving. That was pretty awesome. Computers can think faster, analyze faster, and react faster than humans which makes things safer across the board for everyone driving. I, for one, am excited to see more of our Mobileye chauffeurs driving people around on the road. Let me know what you think of self-driving and Robo Taxis down in the comments. I'm very curious to see what your reaction is. Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.",

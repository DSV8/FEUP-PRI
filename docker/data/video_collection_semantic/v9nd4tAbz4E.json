    "transcript": "- Samsung is no stranger to cheating in benchmarks. They've been doing it for years and they are not the only ones. The question I have this time is, why? Their new flagship S95B TV checks just about every flipping box 4K, 120 Hertz, variable refresh rate over 1,000 nits peak brightness. And it's got the best color performance of any display I've ever seen, ever. And then Samsung had to go and put this brown stain on their glorious victory by getting caught juicing. It's a ridiculous self own almost as ridiculous as this segue to our sponsor - AnyCubic, the Photon M3 AirPure and water washable resin is an affordable, fantastic entry level combo to explore resin 3D printing. You can print detailed miniatures, right outta the box. Learn more at the link below. (upbeat music) - My first hands on with Samsung's QD-OLED or Quantum Dot OLED Display Technology was with Alienware's AW3423DW. And I said, I wonder the TVs with this coming. And here it is, and all it's glory but while I'd like to start by saying it combines the amazing peak brightness of Quantum Dot with the perfect blacks of OLED with no apparent burning downside. Instead, I have to address the scandal first. Vincent from HDTV Test, great channel by the way, discovered that while the S95B seems color accurate when reviewing it in a standard sized test pattern window, if you adjust it to something nonstandard the TV outputs a brighter image than expected, or I don't know, maybe it's just his unit. No, no, it's not. Ours came off the shelf from the local Best Buy. It was not provided by Samsung. And when we compared our 2% window tests to our previous ones, at 10%, you can see right here the EOTF curve isn't followed nearly as closely. And we get major luminance errors when testing in HDR. This isn't what the content creator intended and it shouldn't be happening. But it also doesn't mean that the image looks like garbage. The color accuracy enthusiasts in our office who wandered by during testing noted that it does look a little too vibrant when watching HDR content but still walked away saying it looked amazing. Even if they felt like something was ever so slightly off. As for SDR, it's quite accurate in the standard 10% window netting us a Delta E average of 2.7 in filmmaker mode, but it gets even better. Samsung has a little trick up their sleeve. If you have an iPhone or a newer Samsung phone there's a DIY calibration option hidden away in the menus. So we paired a Galaxy S21 using the app and followed the instructions, netting us an average Delta E of just 1.7 in standard dynamic range with our reds and purples standing out as our problem colors. And as for HDR, we went from 10.3 with luminance errors down to 7.7. We have no idea how it's getting an accurate enough reading to then calibrate the display using it. But it works at least in standard tests. Let's go take a look at how pretty it is, shall we? Before I can do that, I've been tasked with the apparent challenge of getting it out of game mode. It enters this mode automatically. And then if you're gonna create an error message that says, hey, here's what you need to do to do this thing you're trying to do right now, why not just have a button that says, do that. Oh, oh, there's a game sound mode. Why do I have to go to the quick setting? Isn't this the quick settings. Why is there a game mode submit, no, no, no holding right on the deep head brings it up. Why would that... Oh, my God. So it tells me to go to the settings menu that I'm already in to change the thing I'm trying to change. I'm gonna throw this thing through the screen. Oh, my God. It previews with audio? - Yeah. - It previews with fricking audio though. Well, you've got plenty of time to see it cause it's gonna play forever. - Netflix does that too. A lot of things preview with audio now. - Yeah, but this is the freaking home menu of my TV. - I know. Maybe you want to hear it a little bit? - No, I don't. - You don't want to hear it a little bit? - No, I want to use the menu of my TV. - The speakers are good though. - I guess we can talk about IO. It's got four HDMI 2.1 ports. That's really nice to see. One has eARC. It's got an optical port, two USB media ports, WiFi 5. It has ethernet, but this guy didn't bother to test how fast it goes. - The internet didn't work in the bedroom set. - You complain the remote sucks. But honestly it's not really any worse than like the shield remote. - Well, yeah, but I don't think the shield remote's any good either. - So they're charging. - USBC2 on the back. - Yeah, it seems fine. I mean, it's the interface that sucks. Why is it that I keep being dropped back into shadow of the Tomb Raider here? I'm trying to use the menu. - So my main problem is that there's no input source button. - Oh, that's so true. - So try to change source manually look for it, try to find it. You already missed it. - Oh, did I now? On settings? - You're close. It's connected devices. - Shut up. - This took me way too long to find. And I don't understand why it's here instead of just like on the side hen you bring up the menu, like why isn't there just like input one, input two, input three, or whatever - That is so stupid. - Yeah. - And it keeps blanking. - I know it does that too. Now that there's like a PC, that's got a game running. I think it's because there's something active on the signal. It's trying to pull you back into that active channel. - But I'm doing things right now. - I know I know. I think once we play contact on the shield, it'll be like, okay, we're good. - I can see why they didn't send us a review sample. - Go to the shield, connected devices. - Oh, my God. - Where is it? - Why is Mark Strong in like everything I've looked at lately? - I don't know. - We came back after the weekend and found out Samsung pushed a firmware update on Monday that fixes the window size issue. As you can see, it's still not quite perfect but it's significantly better than what we saw before. They don't get any kudos for this though because this happened only after they got caught and it never should have been sent to stores like this in the first place. So if you have an S95B and you wanna get the latest updates make sure you download the firmware from their site and install it using a USB flash drive auto update was no help for us and kept telling us that 1204 was the latest and greatest update available. Thanks, Samsung. And also, thanks, Samsung. - This is like a really good fire scene. Yeah, yeah. Around here is fine. - That's one of the things that QD-OLED really excels at is extremely vibrant yellows. - Yellow and red. - A big part of the reason for it is that unlike traditional OLEDs it doesn't have a white sub pixel. So it doesn't need that to boost to max brightness. It can actually achieve its maximum brightness with individual colors. Wow. - Yeah. - That fire looks fiery. - Yeah, this is the big one shot. - You can really feel the cold. - There's a lot of white on screen and it's not dimming or anything. - No, not even a little. - The grass is super green still. And you've still got these bright explosion flashes and it looks like you can see every grain of dust and stuff in each of the clouds too. - And of course you get the absolutely perfect blacks in the bar. So you don't have any kind of distracting glow or anything. That was one of the things James really brought up when he went down to see the panel tech early was that metal looks richer and more metal. - [Man] Yeah, like look at the shine on that button on the left of his coat. - [Linus] Yeah. - [Man] Like you see the reflection on all of the surfaces. - [Linus] I mean even in his eyes too. - Yeah. Okay. Check out in Canto. Check it in Canto. They've got one scene with some fireworks. It's nuts. - [Linus] Wow, this looks good. - [Man] The colors, eh. - [Linus] Wow. - Like the bright highlights are just incredible. - Wow. - That's pretty much it, I just wanna see the fireworks - Man, it's not just bright. - I know, it's the contrast. - It's the richness. - Yeah. You don't think it's brown until you see this and then yellows. - It's shining instead of looking like it's yellow. Wow, like that firework goes off and you're like, whoa. - Yeah, okay. It doesn't have Dolby Vision, but check out the Dolby Vision demo. - It doesn't have Dolby Vision? - No, it's the one it's got HDR 10 plus. - What? - It's got HDR 10 plus. - Samsung, what are you doing? Basically, perfect. - Perfect. - If you can see the TV, you are getting the full experience. - Now you don't mind sitting on the side of the room. - Well, I'm still gonna be centered. - Well, sure but you don't feel bad for it I guess. - But I don't feel as bad. Yeah. - Crank up, crank up the noise. The speakers are actually really good on this TV. - Man, that looks good. - I know. - The fire. - Even the sound. - It's not bad. - For TV speakers with no sound bar. And it's still gonna work with a sound bar if you get it with all the other speakers in the TV as long as it's Q-Symphonic compatible. - Right, and that's something that Sony's also been pushing with their center channel TVs. It actually works really well. Like juicing up your center like that is really important to enjoying anything with dialogue, which is like everything. - The major complaint that people have been complaining about. - Yeah. - In TV and movies for the last like 15 years. - Yeah. - I can't hear what they're saying in the quiet scenes - I have to turn it down when there's something big happening. - Yeah. - Did I catch myself falling for Best Buy vivid effect during those fireworks? - I think you kind of did. - I think I did. - Because like even though we tested it in a 10% window and it looked great, like really accurate. - [Linus] Yeah. - When we did it again in a 2% window, it's obviously pretty wrong. Like you see it clearly and this is not a 10% window or a 2% window, it's a full screen. So I don't know. - Is it okay to just enjoy those boosted highlights when everything else looks so good? - I don't mind personally. I think it looks really good when you put it up next to a direct, like actual mastering monitor. - Yeah. - You can see the difference and it's kind of like, okay, sure, I'd probably pick that one. But if I walked into a store and I saw this playing content, - You'd be like wow. - I'd be like, wow, that's amazing. - So is what Samsung's doing shady? Absolutely. But it still looks amazing just like our new screwdriver T-shirt, get yours today while you wait for the real screwdriver to come out, soon, I promise for real this time. Now let's pivot to gaming. I mean, who needs movies when you've got unskippable cut scenes, right? The panel does up to 4K 120 Hertz with support for variable refresh rate and auto latency mode. And the results are? Well, we're waiting for the lab to figure out a better way to run pursuit tests on OLEDs but let me say this subjectively, the UFO looks shockingly crisp. And when it comes to click to photon latency we were getting about 18 milliseconds, which is darn good. We've even seen reports of the panel being able to be over clocked to 144 Hertz. It was Vincent, right? - Yeah, HDTV test. - Damn. Wow, that saturation though. - I know, I know. Oh, so that's one problem is in game mode we're stuck between two different picture options. - It's like content and entertainment or something like that. They call it two different things. So we can't get a calibrated filmmaker mode or even the custom like calibrated movie mode that we get using the phone app. - This is the kind of upgrade that you make where it makes all your old content new again. - Yeah. - If you're gonna go back and play your old favorites again cause you've never seen them like this. You know what I mean? - Yeah. - I had just let myself accept that red light meant just a red cast on everything around me. This looks lit in red. Wow. - Keep going, it gets better. But the shooting feels good, right? Like everything's responsive cause it's 120 Hertz. - 100%. - Variable refresh rate. - 100%. - Super like automatic, low latency mode. - Whoa, are you seeing this, Brandon? Of course you are cause of the viewing angles, man, why wouldn't we just use a TV like this for like editing? - Maybe this becomes our new mainstay living room TV, huh? - I feel like for LG, it's the equivalent of overclocking your last gen processor to try and compete with your competitor's new gen one though. - Yeah. - Sony's actually not just staying 100% siloed these days. They're actually using the like image and sound expertise they have across their company to make like their products better - Screen ratio 60 by nine. That doesn't look like it right now. I don't know what's going on right now, game settings. And then you see how it pulls up this mode even though we're already in the game settings mode. - [Linus] No. - I know. So this is why I don't like auto. - Can we solve the more pressing issue? Which is that if you just squish- - Yeah, I don't why it did that, I think it's a thing in here. - Okay. - It was a Tomb Raider thing, not the TV. - Oh Nelly, that- - It's doing it. - That is smooth. That is responsive. And look at those mouse cursors. Each one is a discreet distinct. - Yeah. - It looks like a CR freaking T. - That's my testing. Every time when I get any monitor is I look at the cursor, can you do a circle. - There's no trail. - Yeah. But even here look at like the bright flashlight against like the dark rocks or whatever - It's blinding. - Yeah. - Like I wanna turn it off. - Yeah, look how bright that light is though. - I know it is. - And look at how big. - Wow. - And that's like a huge portion of the screen. - Yeah, you're right. - And it doesn't dim. Right? Like it's insane. - That is mind blowing. No pure OLED is gonna do that. Well, that was a useful demo anyway. - Yeah, totally. - Just to see that flashlight seer my eyes. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Did you notice any weird dimming, like where it'll just periodically dim or brighten like the LGL OLEDs did? - No, but I've got that turned off. You can turn it off on this and I haven't seen it happen since then. Cause that's a thing, I can't deal with that. I hate watching your monitor during script review because it just dims constantly. I don't like this. - It can apparently be fixed with like a hidden menu, but LG has it hidden away because of the risk of burning. But if it's not a risk because as the old led pixels fade, they should fade fairly evenly. Since the color is handled by the Quantum Dot layer then Samsung doesn't have to do that. It's very impressive. And I cannot wait to see the same panel with a processor from Sony in the new Bravia XRA95K. I think that's the one that's gonna end up in my family room at my new house. Get subscribed by the way so you don't miss it. I'm not taking any sponsorships for that spot because that's a really important TV watching spot for me. So it's gonna come down to the 65-inch heavyweight champion and there's more than just two contenders. LG has been hard at work improving their Gen 2 OLED panels. And we've got a G2 on the way as well. Of course we haven't really talked about price yet. While last gen OLED is becoming more affordable, all of the TVs that I just mentioned are not. And the cheapest option currently is actually the one we're looking at today the S95B at 3,000 US Dollars. That's a lot in a world where you can go to the local Best Buy and pick up a 65 inch TV for like 500 bucks. But it's a value compared to the A95K and still a couple hundred dollars cheaper than the G2. Another major hurdle to overcome with this latest generation is the lack of size options. While LGS OLEDs are coming out in both larger and smaller models. Sony and Samsung are both stuck with just 55 inch and 65 inch for the time being. As they perfect the QD-OLED manufacturing process. It's a Samsung not Sony in this case we're sure to see more size options, but for now you might end up having no choice but to stick with LG since size does matter. Oh, there's more good news though everyone, last year's OLEDs, there's still top notch and the prices are finally coming down so you can save a buck now. And if you can wait a little longer for this to be last gen, wow, are you ever in for something special at hopefully a more affordable price? You know what else is affordable? Waiting to hear about our sponsor. Ting Mobile, tired of paying for some ting and getting no ting in return?

    "transcript": "Today we'll be doing a camera lens replacement on the LG G6. I broke this lens on purpose, specifically for this video. Some people might call that phone abuse, but I think it's for a good cause. There are multiple ways to accomplish this task. One is my removing the back glass panel and popping the lens off from the inside. But today I'm going to try a less invasive maneuver and pull the lens off from the front. As always, I'll be using Bonafide Hardware replacement camera lenses just because I know they are real glass and not the imitation plastic stuff. Let's get started. [Intro] The LG G6 has a pretty big slab of glass for a camera lens, and with that extra surface area comes a slightly higher chance of breaking. I'm using Bonafide Hardware camera lenses. I went through several different suppliers and it took a while to find a real glass lens. These guys made the cut. The lens is held on by a similar adhesive like we saw on the back of the Samsung Galaxy camera lenses; the more heat it has, the softer it gets and the easier it is to remove. I'll warm it up until it's just barely too hot to touch. Once it's extremely warm, I'll take my razor and try to grab the lip of the glass and leverage it out. A sharp razor is best for this, or if you have a chuck of glass missing out of your lens, you can start there too with a pair of tweezers or something. If you're wondering why my phone is clear, I'll add a link for that video in the description. Now that I have my tool for the glass, I'll warm it up one last time and lift the rest of the glass off from the phone. My adhesive came up attached to the glass and it's holding it all relatively together, which is good. It's extremely important that glass dust does not fall into the camera unit. You can see the normal camera on the right, and the wide angle lens on the left. Glass dust will stop the camera from focusing and stabilizing so be careful. I'll turn the camera side down and give it a couple sharp taps on the screen to help clear out any dust that might have fallen down into the lens. And then I'll test the camera without the exterior glass in place. Everything appears to be working and the camera can still focus and take pictures that probably deserves a thumbs up if you're into that kind of thing. The Bonafide Hardware replacement glass for the LG G6 comes with it's own adhesive on the back. Like with any glass, I'll make sure that both sides are clean from dust and fingerprints before pulling off the protective layer. And then I'll snip off that little nub that remains. Since this is pretty snug, I don't want that little nub getting in the way. I'll set the lens into place, making sure to keep my fingerprints off from the underside of the glass. That will be impossible to clean once the lens is set down. A few final test pictures to make sure everything is clean and working. If that camera is taking blurry pictures or won't focus, make sure that the glass you installed is clean and clear. If it still won't focus after that, it's probably dust that got inside the camera unit. Sometimes that will clear up on it's own after a few days, or you can try a few soft taps on the screen like we did earlier with the camera side face down. Gravity will help jostle any last dust out from the camera.

Thanks a ton for watching and I'll see you around. If you made it this far in the video, tell me what your current favorite song is in the comments below. I need some new music in my life. Thanks!",

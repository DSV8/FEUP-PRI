    "transcript": "well guys I'm back on camera and guess what we are also back at Thermaltake after looking at their cases but something really caught my eye and that is the toughram it's not the toughram that you guys have seen us posting about on social media that has RGB everywhere this is super different but first I wanted to thank our sponsors if it wasn't for Thermaltake be quiet Phanteks and razer none of the CES 2020 coverage would have been possible who else was there who else what other sponsor so about the toughram ddr4 and white really caught my eye is not because of the RGB because you can see RGB everywhere around us you're in thermal take this is really almost like the anti thermaltake where there's absolutely no RGB a lot of you guys commented that look yes there's Alexa control on their other toughRam but it really was that RGB that you didn't necessarily want to pay for so what they did is they went back to the drawing board a little bit and they completely removed it so they have a white kit and a combo silver black kit and this is actually going to be offered in exactly the same speeds and exactly the same capacities as their kits that they have right now so that would be a 16 kit so a 2 by 8 and up to 40 400 megahertz they're thinking about releasing a 32 gig kit but they want to know more about your feedback on this and if that's something that you would want to buy and the best part about all of this is that this is gonna cost less than the RGB kits and to me it actually looks better it's probably gonna match with a lot of other systems a lot better provide you're going towards that white or black look now we're gonna go to eber because he's got some other things that he wanted to talk about on the other side of thermaltake CES showcase alright so now we're gonna be talking about a keyboard that's right a keyboard super exciting stuff now this is the TK5 mechanical keyboard notice I didn't mention gaming because some will take is really targeting fist or it's a different type of market not necessarily gamers but somewhere in the middle where people who prefer having a mechanical switch but at the same time being able to sit and have a really good experience gaming on it now this is a full-size mechanical keyboard so that means you get an UMP at as well as a dedicated media playback control setup right at the top right hand side and a volume dial which is highly appreciated it has very good scroll steps so I really like Babel imitation of that on this keyboard now let's take a step back and talk about it sign of BTK five because to me it's actually kind of unique because I love the dark gray finish on the top and it adds a nice sort of industrial look RGB lighting has made its way into this keyboard which means you are gonna get that extra bling if you are looking for the Hat and you also get that nice little RGB strip on the sides there's a full-size USB pass-through port as well as an audio pastor port at the front this also comes with a detachable of wrist rest although I did find something very interesting the wrist wrist isn't actually extend and to end the actual chassis it's actually a little bit shorter which i think is a little bit interesting but yeah maybe it could be resolved in the final release now in terms of switch options Thermaltake is only offering Cherry MX Blues and MX Silver's no Reds no Browns not even Cale switches part of the reason why Thermaltake created this new series is to make sure that individual components or peripherals they sort of match with each other in terms of color scheme and the way how they looks that's why we have the headset holder the mouse mat the mouse which Dmitri is going to talk about very shortly and so I think overall as a scent it looks pretty cool and I'm really curious to know what you guys think about it now pricing for the keyboard is expected to be $159 us and it's expected to launch in q1 and that's pretty much it guys now we're gonna have Dmitri chime in on the TK 5 no the TM 5 Mouse all right boys now I'm taking over with the mouse game the TM 5 RGB Wireless which is this one and the TM 5rg be wired completely so the cool thing a few cool things about the wireless mouse it is 2.4 gigahertz bluetooth and you can also use it while it's plugged in a few ridiculous things that we found is the the actual USB receiver is absolutely massive like thermaltake is really stuffing something down there just to showcase that this is a Thermaltake dongle and nothing else like Logitech has a tiny one Razer has a slightly bigger one and Thermaltake has the biggest dongle so let's get all the technical specifications out of the way we have 50 million Omron switches we have 3389 sensor top-of-the-line sensor 60,000 dpi not exactly sure about the software implementation and like how many steps you can adjust them but normally power like 50 or 100 which is totally fine the weight unfortunately for this body is unknown the battery life is rated after 40 hours not sure exactly this is with RGB which is both at the bottom and the scroll wheel very bright and this is a prototype sample so still kind of looks a little finicky in terms of like the low sections at the front here they are they have a little bit more play but in terms of the actual shape this reminds me very well of the G 900 from Logitech is in the way the actual switches are slightly raised it's very good for fingertip and claw style not so much for palm grip style it is a truly ambidextrous design so buttons on both left and right side they do stick out a little bit too much especially on the opposite side where my thumb is not I can feel the buttons with my ring finger and I feel like the front button is a bit too forward where I have to almost readjust my hand grip to reach it but overall I feel like it's a maybe a good potential way for thermal tape to get into the gaming arena especially because this thing is $89 so if it's going to be competing with like the Razer basileus ultimate or the G 900 all those mice are more expensive so the technicals here are very good and by the way the scroll wheel has this aluminum texture the fine scroll steps really nice middle click as well and in terms of the overall body matte black nothing too fancy and I'm really excited to see what the final product for the tm5 RGB is gonna look like now as for the t5 RGB wired a few differences include a total under glow for the bottom so that does actually shine underneath the mousekemap looks very beautiful the cable is also removable on the wired version which means that you could potentially replace it and unfortunately it is not like paracord style so it does kink so I'm hoping that they do maybe take note especially because this mouse will be $59 so in terms of the shape and like the actual construction of it is pretty good hoping they improve it on the cable to match on whatever is available now for $59 from glorious from Razer but yeah this is the t5 RGB wired and wireless thank you guys for watching our coverage from Thermaltake signing off I'll talk to you guys in next video oh wait I'm supposed to do the u9 it was it was killer I have energy I don't even remember what I said",

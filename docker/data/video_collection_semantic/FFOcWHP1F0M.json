    "transcript": "When I started trying to cook the perfect steak a few years ago, I came across a LOT of conflicting information online. And on the surface, that seems logical: I mean cooking is an art. BUT, it's also a science and the great thing about science is *repeatability*this video will cover what's true, what's BS, and how to ACTUALLY get that perfectly cooked steak every time. So, there's this bookModernist Cuisinewritten by the near-billionaire ex-CTO of Microsoft Nathan Myhrvold and Chris Younga former chef at The Fat Duck and protege of the famed Heston Blumenthal. In it, these scientist chefs address HOW meat cooksand spoiler alert: it has everything to with water. While basically everything we eat has some moisture content, proteins like beef muscle consist of nearly 75% water. And the thing about water is that it's water until its not. As your steak hits a hot pan, that satisfying sizzle comes resulting from water on the surface of the protein vaporizing as steam; and rather quickly, the meat starts to brown in what Modernist Cuisine calls a desiccation zone. This browning is the consequence of the Maillard reaction where amino acids and reducing sugars break down the protein and create a caramelization layer. This is the same process that gives fried onions their savory umami taste, french fries their golden brown color, and yes, a good steak its delicious, signature crust. Right next to the crust where water has evaporated already is the boiling zonemeat right at 212 degreeswhere the water content is bursting through the top and bottom of the meat as high-pressure steam. But despite this boiling zone, the temperature falls off quickly and the center of the meat remains cold because most of the joules from your pan go towards facilitating evaporationevaporation which somewhat counterintuitively COOLS the pan as it condenses and insulates the meat from the pans heat. So logic would dictate we crank the crap out of our pan's heat forcing more energy inside the protein, right? Wrong. And that's the biggest misconception about cooking steak. The center of the meat slowly warms via conduction via the BOILING and DESSICATION zones. No matter how hot your panand subsequentlyhow hot your crust, you cannot conductively cook meat any faster BECAUSE you're limited by the boiling point of water inside the muscle tissue. Increasing the temperature of your pan too high only does two very bad things: (1) it makes that boiling zone larger which when cooled will just be overdone, dry meat, and (2) it will burn your crust and fry off any spices you've covered the steak in. Let me prove that with an experiment. [throw steak in b-roll] You'll see that we're up here in the mountains, but despite that, we're powering our 1600W induction cooktop, our studio lights, a refrigerator, and sous vide circulator off of an Anker SOLIX F3800today's sponsor. This is a 3.8kWh battery with lithium iron phosphate batteries ready for more than 3,000 charge cycles and over 10 years of every day use. That longevity is thanks to its smart temperature control managed by active cooling. Not only can it run everything we're powering for another.... X hours, but it goes beyond just 120V to powering 240V devices like air conditioning units and dryers as welland simultaneously, I might add. 3840Wh is a lot. How much? Well, I can add 10 miles of range to my super inefficient Rivian R1S. So, imagine how long that could power the lights in your home. When its time to recharge, it can do so with 2400W of solar input if you've got it or from an AC outlet at 1800W recharging via 120V AC power in just 2.4 hours. It's also the world's first power station that supports AC coupling allowing you to work from solar panels and the grid simultaneouslyor storing excess solar when you've got it. Of course, you canand shouldexpand beyond a single unit to nearly 54 kWh of storageenough to power your home for days. This is the most accessible power-station given it can be standalone or installed into your home by an electrician in just a few hours giving you 80% of traditional home power storage systems at just 50% of the cost. The Anker SOLIX F3800 is available for preorder now and the first buyers will get up to 45% off before its official launch. Click the link in the video description below to learn more. I'm cooking two steaks of the same thickness and weight to exactly the same internal temperature with a flip halfway through the cook. This experiment is controlled using these amazing thermometers from Combustion Inc and this induction stovetop from Breville. This isn't sponsoredI just love both of these thingsthe Combustion probes have 8 thermistors along their length and so you just jam it in there and it automatically finds the true core temperature of your meat by whichever probe reads lowest. You can also see every other temperature from center to crust to ambient. They're low-energy Bluetooth, can be used with a little controller or via a phone app that collects no data and doesn't even have a login. I love them. The cooktop is induction but involves the use of a temperature probe right at the center to take a constant reading of the pan's temperature applying or removing energy as needed. One steak will be cooked to medium-rare on a 350 degrees Fahrenheit pan temperature, and the other at almost 500 degrees. And what we find out is that despite the drastically different temperatures, total cook time... isn't. If any difference can be identified at all, it's that our meat cooked at a higher temperature weighs slightly less because it lost more water due to heat resulting in a larger ring of well-done meat. No thanks. So we've learned lower temperatures yield better results. But is that true for all meats? This is only a 1\" thick strip. What if I have a 2.5\" thick filet mignon? I definitely want to use a higher temperature there, right? Wrong again. The thicker your steak, the LOWER you want your temperature to avoid burning your crust and that boiling-zone creep. I pan-fry filets as low as 325 degrees or \"medium\" as so scientifically indicated by most stovetops. But by this logic, why not go even lower you're thinking? And smart you arebecause that alludes to a method preferred by manythe reverse sear. As the name suggests, you subject the meat to high temperature: last. The 30-45 minute method (popularized by Kenji Lopez) involves tossing a steak onto a wire rack and cooking it in a 200-250 degree oven until it comes about 10 degrees shy of its desired final temperature. Why? You know the answer: because conduction will continue to heat the center of the meat by several degrees after we remove it from heat. The longer, 1-2 hour method is one you've certainly heard of: sous vide. By placing our meat in a water bath that's the temperature we'd like the meat cooked tosay 130 degrees which is medium rare, the meat will slowly heat up to medium rare but never even a single degree past that because it can't get warmer than the water its surrounded by. Regardless of method used, you'll find yourself with a steak that's fully cooked and safe to eat, but one that looks like this: ugly and grey and sad. What are we missing? The Maillard reactionthat delicious desiccation zone. This is where we sear, in reverse. Exposing our steak to high heat, we can quickly encourage rendering of fat and formation of a crust, but not permit enough time to elapse that we further cook our steak's core. 30 seconds per side is plenty. The end result is a steak that's delicious and tender, but requires a lot of time and doesn't work well for every cut. So what's the ultimate way scientifically cook the perfect steak without wasting hours of your day? Let me show you. Grab your steaks from the fridge and put them on the counter for 1-4 hours or if you have a life like me, put 'em in a ziploc bag in a pot of room temperature water for 10-15 minutes to let them temperthat's a fancy way to say \"make the steaks closer to the warmth of our pan.\" Chris Young himself has an excellent video on this subject, but to summarize... if you've ever cooked sous vide, you'll notice the temperature of your meat rapidly rises in the beginning, but the final 2-5 degrees take the majority of the cooking time. Throwing a bone-cold steak on a smoldering-hot pan will cause the temperature of the steak's exterior to cook much quicker than the steak's interiorincreasing that boiling zone and overcooking most of our meat. After your meat is tempered, put your pan on the hob, set it medium to medium-high and add an oil with a high smoke pointnot olive oil. Gordon Ramsay uses olive oil when cooking steak but you're watching this video so you're clearly not Gordon Ramsay. Olive oil has a very low smoke point and can burn and taste terrible and ruin your steak if you're not super carefuland frankly, it doesn't add basically anything to the flavor anyways so it's not worth the risk. I recommend grapeseed oil as a pleasant neutral oil that doesn't have much flavor, but if you want to avoid seed oil you can use refined coconut oil. In a pinch, avocado oil is mild and will work too. Let the pan and your oil heat up for several minutes but don't let it get so hot it smokes. The reason for this whole song and dance is to eliminate cold spots in our pan. As the pan is toastin' up, dab your steaks with paper towels to remove surface moistureoil and water ain't friendsand then generously season with salt, pepper, and if you're cool, a little garlic powder. Take your steaks and lay them into the pan away from you in case any hot oil tries to splash out and then throw in some fresh thyme or rosemary and a little garlic if you'd like. Flip your steak frequentlyevery minute to begin with and every couple minutes following the first few. Why..? Because you'll often hear peopleeven some celebrity chefssay you should only flip the steak once during the cook because it helps create a thicker crust and locks in moisture. This is demonstrably false and you probably know why this is the case by now. Look at the top of my steak when I flipped it just once earlier in the video... there's a ton of steam coming out the top and if there's steam that means moisture is leaving the meatthis steam is under such immense pressure, a thicker crust isn't going to prevent it from escaping. Flipping the steak frequently reduces the temperature differential between the pan and the surface of the meat each time you flip ithelping the exterior of the meat convect towards the inside more quickly while simultaneously not overcooking. It's the best of both worlds and if you don't believe me, here's proof: the left is a steak flipped every minute and the right is only flipped once. Not only does the right steak take significantly longer to come to temperature, but it also has a much larger boil zone. Once your frequently-flipped steak comes within about 15 degrees of your desired doneness as identified by a probe or instant-read thermometer, pull it off the pan and let it rest on a wire rack. Carryover convection will continue to cook the inside as the exterior cools down and while you can always pop it back on for another minute if it's too rare, you can't undo that which is overdone. Last, a lot of peopleGordon Ramsay includedplace a pad of butter in with the steak near the end of the cook and baste the steak by spooning the juices atop which theoretically encourages the Maillard reaction, but it's also really easy to burn the butter if you're not watching your temperature closely (which is yucky). Instead, while the steak is resting and my pan begins to cool, I chuck a pad of unsalted butter in with the herbs and then pour the liquid gold atop the steak when I'm ready to serve. It helps heat the steak back up slightly, never burns, and in blind tests with multiple people I've had over, nobody has been able to tell the difference between basting while cooking and not so save yourself the time, the stress and skip it. And that's it. That's how you cook the perfect steak. With science. Thank you so much for watching, and as always: stay snazzy.",

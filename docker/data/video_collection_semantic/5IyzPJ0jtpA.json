    "transcript": "- [Anthony] So here's the deal, you've got a retro game collection, you've got a Super Nintendo, you've got a tower of power, but you also got like an LCD TV and you've got, I don't know, a capture device that only takes HTMI. This is all you're gonna get out of these things, by default, at least in North America. What do you do? You can get HD retro vision cables for like the Super Nintendo, but then you gotta make sure that your TV is compatible with it 'cause it only outputs 240p, it's a mess. And that is why this exists, this is the OSSC Open Source Scan Converter. Basically, what it does is it takes component, VGA and this big chunker right here, that many people in North America probably won't be familiar with called Scart. It's a rather large connector that can carry composite video RGB, which is kind of like VGA, but not really. It's a little bit different. Basically. It was like HTMI before digital signals were a thing or at least for video, a lot of these older consoles actually had the ability to output RGB and what's the most convenient way to get it scarred. It can carry it. It's fine. So we don't need to worry about any kind of ridiculous converters or anything. These just exist in Europe and also in Japan is the JP 21 connector. All you need to do is plug one end into the OSSE and the other into your console here. And as long as your console is either RGB modded, or in the case of the super Nintendo and the Sega Genesis cannot put RGB on its own, then you're fine. You have a very clean signal coming out of your retro console. Now there are other options available for you. If you just want to get your retro game upon a TV, you've got these kind of inexpensive, a Raz Fox Ave to HTMI converters that just basically take your regular barrel plug, send a spits out a digital signal. The problem is they're using these barrel plugs and this is just composite video. Basically it's taking the entirety of the video signals. So chroma Luma, that is the color information and the brightness information. And just combining it, what you get is a lot of interference compared to RGB, which has the red, green, and blue and synchronization all on separate lines, this is a vastly inferior connection standard, at least as far as resolution goes, I guess we can take a look at the actual unit itself a little bit more closely. So we have, again, these component inputs and a scart, as well as VGA. There's the barrel Jack of the power. We've got an LCD on the front that is backlit. You can turn the back light off and the options, if it bugs you, it's got two little buttons for control here on the kind of recessed in the inside here. And it has a jaytag port for programming. You won't really need that because it also has a micro SD card slot through which you can actually load up a Micro SD card with firmware and will just flash itself. But if you ever break that for some reason, then you have the J tank port. Beside from that, we've got two audio inputs. These are both three and a half millimeter. These go with the component and for the VGA, whereas scar carries its own audio. This is one of these standard or most that comes with it. It is a lot more complex than it needs to be. Just as a result of it being universal TV remote. It's just kind of a standard one. I'm not sure if there's like a model or any distinctive markings or anything on it. I don't think so, but yeah, this one has an overlay applied for the OSSE and it tells you all of the different functions that you're able to access through the remote directly. So we have all the different controls for the first input. AB one, which I believe is the scart. AB two, I believe is the a component and AB three would be VGA. I think that's about it for the remote. There are more settings we can tweak when we have it up and running, but well, we'll have to get it up and running for that. Let's get a baseline by using the Raz box AB to HTMI converter. This'll give us basically the same kind of image quality that we can expect on a typical TV these days. Not quite what we would have gotten on a CRT back then, but nothing is quite as CRTV. This does not look good. I don't know. Well, this is coming through on the camera, but there's all kinds of artifacts here. A lot of it might be just because this set of cheaper Raz Fox box here, I think might expect for ATI versus what's currently being displayed, which is 240 P. The problem with that is that 240 p was never standardized, but it has all these weird graphical bugs. And just in general, you can see how the hard lines there kind of change color between like green and magenta. And let's just play it for a minute and see how the latency is. Anyway. It's not perfect, but it's not terrible either. If it's, if there's any lag, it's probably like one or two frames. This feels a lot like just playing with an emulator where there's a little bit of lag. There are options available now that allow you to run the emulator ahead of time, which is kind of interesting. It's like time traveling. So you can actually get latency. That's less than the original consoles, but in this case, this is the original console. And I think all the latency is both in the box itself, which might be a frame maybe, and in the display. So that's what super Nintendo looks like. let's flip it over to Sega and see what that looks like. That is super blurry. Like the text is barely readable here and you can see in 1994 cigarettes, it's like full of rainbow artifacts and all that kind of stuff. I don't even have to explain what that is. You can see it. There's just colors where there shouldn't be colors. Oh man, that's distracting. That's signpost there. Ooh, don't do this. (blows) - [David] Why not? - [Anthony] Cause it doesn't do anything. You just the best way to do it. Let me show you (clanging) feel that that's friction. It'll take the dust off fun fact. You don't need to press the eject button on the Snus. No, you don't have to. They just thought it would be fun. But if this snus is on it, won't come out - [David] That's an Anthony tech tip, everybody. - [Anthony] Retroactive. Now let's grab the OSSE and see how that now you may be wondering where we get these cables. These aren't exactly commonplace in North America and they'd been obsolete for a fair while now. These came from retro game cables, a company in the UK that actually builds these. This is there a universal sniffs pack, a puncture actually universal Nintendo. It works on in 64 and GameCube as well. And here we go, this is a four by three picture and it looks ridiculously sharp. So the first thing that's very obvious. There's no ghosting whatsoever. This actually looks more or less like an emulator. Now this is an analog signal still. It's just analog can look good. Like VGA used to be really good. This is more or less the same thing as VGA. It's just, you know, not quite one of the big things about the OSSE is that it's actually taking the input that it's receiving and looking at it line by line, not frame by frame. So there is less than one frame of lag and I can feel it. It is smooth. This game could be flaky. (clanging) I may need to clean that. - [David] I'm telling you Anthony, blow on it. (blows) (both laugh) - [Anthony] Now that that happened, let's try Sega or you can clearly make out the text. I'm sure you can even make it out from way back there. There's no rainbow in this waterfall. There's no rainbows anywhere, which I mean nothing against rainbows, but they're not supposed to be there. That's the difference between having like a good analog signal and a bad one and RGB, even though it's analog is still way better than anything else. Other than if you can get pure digital out of the console, which requires a mod. There's a little bit of in seeing something, this old fire up and I'll put an image of this clean. And for that matter, there are people like speed runners who actually need to be able to verify that their run works properly on an original console. I would say that this is probably your best bet. I've got 150 bucks. It's not a huge investment. And it definitely makes a huge difference this or the rad to X cables based on the retro tank from retro gaming cables. This was a bit of a different video than you usual as seems to be kind of a theme when I'm on camera. But if you want to see something else similar to this, maybe check out Alex's iMac tear down that he did. And Oh, the SD, the Snus, the cartridge to a rom adapter that we reviewed a little while ago on LTT. Thanks for watching and try.",

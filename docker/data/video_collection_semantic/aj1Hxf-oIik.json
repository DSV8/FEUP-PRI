    "description": "A dual-screen smartwatch sounds like the most ridiculous thing ever devised ... until you stop trying to imagine the screens side by side and instead stack them one atop the other. That's a trick that Mobvoi borrows from Casio for its new TicWatch Pro, and the result is a smartwatch with unparalleled outdoor readability. It also makes for the longest-lasting smartwatch you've ever seen  you've just got to turn off all the smart stuff to make it happen. Join me for the TicWatch Pro review!

    "transcript": "- [Michael Fisher] The dual screen trend. On a laptop, it seems like a usability nightmare. On a smartphone, it's uncomfortable and awkward. But on a smartwatch, it makes all the sense in the world. I'm Michael Fisher, and this is theMrMobile review of the TicWatch Pro. (upbeat electronic music) If you're thinking, what second screen? Well, get this, you're actually already looking at it. You just need to wait for the primary screen to turn off. That's when the top layer clicks to life, a segmented LCD that resembles the Timex or Casio wristwatches of the '90's. Speaking of Casio, they actually beat this one to the punch. Those big Pro Trek watches I've reviewed for the past couple of summers have had a very similar layered display. The TicWatch's implementation works just as well. The whole idea is that this high contrast display is much easier to read out in the sunlight, and a lot more energy efficient, too. I think I said this in one of the Casio Pro Trek reviews: every smartwatch should use this dual screen design. That power efficiency is the reason Mobvoi, the TicWatch Pro's maker, can claim 30 days of life on a single charge, but that's only if you disable the smartwatch features of Wear OS and basically use it as a dumb watch. This is called a central mode, and even in this mode, though, there is a nice touch: it continues to monitor your heart rate and step count. The Casio Pro Trek doesn't even have a heart rate monitor at all, so one point for the TicWatch. Underneath that fancy display, well, it's a pretty typical Wear OS smartwatch. That product line has sort of languished for the past year, so that's why I'm kind of meh, but there are positives. The app ecosystem is huge. There are many watch faces to choose from, and the basics, like notifications and health tracking, those are handled well. Mobvoi also ships the watch with its own app for custom health tracking, but there's not much reason to use it, unless you want a clone of Apple's Health tracking interface. There's also support for Mobvoi's Smart Home products, if you own any of those. This watch doesn't have a rotating side crown, sad, but it does have two buttons, which means you can program one of them to a shortcut of your choice, while the other either opens the App Drawer or Google Assistant. This is also one of the watches with a speaker, so you can talk directly to Assistant, or even do a call over Bluetooth, though it's kind of tinny and quiet. Under the hood, the silicon running the show is two years old, and while that's not a problem on some smartwatches, I feel like this one has just a bit more lag than I'm used to. And, I gotta be honest, the design does nothing for me. I can get behind a big watch, obviously, but the glossy bezel with its superfluous numerals clashes with the matte casing. And then there's the watch band that comes with it. Leather on the outside, but synthetic within. I get it, it's supposed to look nice while letting your skin breathe, but this watch obviously wasn't meant to be worn with a suit. I mean it's got IP68 dust and water resistance, and a display meant to be read outdoors. Why even bother with the leather? Why not just embrace the chunky sportiness of it all? I don't know, maybe I'm pickin' nits. At the end of the day, I just don't know who this watch's hardware was designed for. Let's wrap it up with battery life. In normal operation this time. The TicWatch Pro is probably the most consistent smartwatch I've used. For me, it lasts exactly three days, 72 hours between charges. Not quite Fitbit territory, but it gets a lot closer than most other Wear OS watches, which I find I usually need to charge every night or every other night on the outside. And it's nice to know Essential Mode is there, if you find yourself backed into a corner. The TicWatch Pro comes in two color ways for 249 dollars, and if you ask me, that's kind of a tough sell. Mobvoi's own TikWatch S and E are between 50 and 100 dollars less and so's the Fitbit Versa. There are other watches with higher price tags, but many of those are trading on the names of their designer labels, and with Wear OS rumored to get a huge renovation later this year, I just can't give an unqualified thumbs-up to any Wear OS device right now. I'd say you should only consider it if you want a great outdoor smartwatch for the summertime, and you want the heart rate monitor and the lower profile that the Casio competition lacks, as well as the lower price tag. If that sounds like you, the TicWatch Pro will be exclusively offered to Amazon Prime members through August 15th. That's an interesting sales model for a smartwatch. I don't think I've seen that before. If you wanna keep the sharpest eye out for deals on this smartwatch and others, be sure to pay a visit to thrifter.com. They're not just my sponsor, they've been saving me money for over a year, and they've got big tips for Amazon Prime Day. And on that subject, be sure you're subscribed to theMrMobile on YouTube, so you don't miss my big Prime Day video when it drops on Monday, July 16th. Until next time, thanks for watching, and stay mobile my friends. (upbeat electronic music)",

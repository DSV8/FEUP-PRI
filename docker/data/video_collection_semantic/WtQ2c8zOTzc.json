    "transcript": "- So a couple of years ago, someone donated this Power Mac G5 to me. And when I went to plug it in the fricking thing exploded and nearly electrocuted me. (electronics popping) Whoa! So today we're gonna try to resurrect it, and you're coming with. Sponsored by Linode. (electronic music) Hey guys, how are you all doing? If you're new here, welcome. My name is Krazy Ken, and this is the G5 which exploded, so I need to fix it. This is one of the liquid cooled models and that fricking very corrosive Dex-Cool just leaked into the power supply. Now, I do find it weird that the pumps for the Dex-Cool were located like near the power supply, above the power supply, so if there's a leak that coolant, that corrosive coolant will just fall into the power supply. Not sure why it was made that way, but it probably wasn't the smartest decision. Now, here's the problem. I don't have the skills or the parts to complete this repair to make this system work again. Now, if only I knew someone who was smart enough, someone with the brains to complete this project and someone with the parts who could complete this, make it- - Hi, Ken. - It's Greg Hrutkay from Hrutkay Mods, how long have you been under that desk? - It's been a few years now. - Damn, you got like a little mattress and everything down there, you've been sleeping in, what? Greg, thank you for coming along and we're gonna try to get this thing working, what do you say? - Sounds good. Okay, so basically anytime you get a G5 you need to figure out what model you have. See if we can open up here. Anytime if you look in here at this label right here, if it says 2.5 or 2.7 it's always liquid cooled. And you need to check everything before you plug it in. - Always, they never did an air cooled version of that, huh? - No, 2.5s, no 2.7s. - Learned something new today. - That's even the quad core, the quad core was a 2.5. - Gotcha. - [Greg] Then you'll want to take this rivet out right here and pull the cover off and check everything. - And I'm starting to see, it looks like we have something leaked on here. - Yeah, you definitely had fluid here, you had fluid on the tray too. - Oh nice. - But you pull the security river out here and it should slide back like so. And then you're gonna want to inspect the pump. Really the rule of thumb is even if you don't see any damage, no leakage or anything like that, you'll want to still take the pump out, inspect the CPU's and inspect the power supply 'cause it could have seeped down in there and you would've never known. We're going to be taking my dual 2.7 air cooled converted, we're going to take the air cooler heat sinks out of that and we're also gonna swap out the power supply and we'll also clean up the CPU's, see if they're salvageable. If we're lucky we can slap it all back together and press the power button and it should start up. - If we're lucky. 'Cause, you know, the Krazy Ken is just so generous to us. - Yeah. - So Greg brought in his giant G5, this was the converted one you were saying, right? - Yep. - So we're gonna borrow some parts from here, right? What's the next step? - Well, we'll show you what's in here. - Oh boy. - Oh, so that's what you meant by the panel's not workin' right, okay. - So yeah, it wouldn't be fair converting with those. So Ken, do you know what the number one rule is about GM Dex-Cool? - What's the number one rule, Greg? - It's corrosive. - Oh, so you got to wear gloves. Purple gloves. - Yeah, purple gloves. - So, what's next. - So what we're going to be doing is taking the cooler out first and then getting down into the power supply. - And normally you could just use an Allen key like this, but this is a two and you need a 2.5. - Yeah, I brought a two and a two and a 2.3, or a three. - Yeah, but not a 2.5, so what's the plan? - So we're going to be using a 2.5 on an iFixit extension. - Thank you, iFixit. - Yeah, thank you. - Not sponsored? - I was gonna say, not a sponsor, unless Kate gets back to me, then. - Forgot to take the fan out here, so we'll just set this over here for now. So we've already taken all the screws out of here. It should in theory, just lift up. - [Ken] In theory. - [Greg] Usually doesn't, just in theory, but you know. Just grab it and pull straight up. Ah, that was actually pretty easy. - All right. - Hey, how about that. It's not looking too bad. A little corrosive. - [Ken] Oh, oh, and something's dripping. - Oh yeah, it's drippin' good. - Oh no, yeah, I can see, there's something on these like contacts or whatever those are. - Look at the rust on that. - Oh, that's juicy. - [Greg] All right, Ken, so we're gonna be taking the power supply out, which involves taking a screw out here and here. We also need to do a visual inspection of the whole board. I see some corrosion on this CPU socket here and the number one thing about GM Dex-Cool, other than the fact that it's corrosive, is it's also highly conductive. - [Ken] Yes, perfect for electronics. - [Greg] Exactly. - Oh yeah. - Oh. - [Ken] You can tell that that thing did a lot of absorbing and not really. - [Greg] Well, that's what it's for is to absorb the liquid. - Can only go so far. - Yeah, I see why it blew up. - [Ken] Oh shoot. - [Greg] Oh yeah, it's just stripping. - [Ken] But of course. That one comes out fine. - Yeah, yeah. But this one you need a, I don't think I can get it off. - [Ken] Yeah, we're gonna need som little, something with more torque or something. - [Greg] When all else fails just bring out the pliers. (Ken laughs) Oh yeah, that worked. - Oh, nice. Hey! Oh! - Yeah. - [Ken] Some nice corrosion there, beautiful. - [Greg] Well the main part of the power supply power delivery is right here and there. - [Ken] There's a lot of rust there. - [Greg] Yeah, that's where most of the liquid seeped into it. - [Ken] Powdered sugar or something. - I wouldn't lick that. - Nope, I've tried that one. No, I'm just kidding,i have not. Don't do that, kids. - Yeah, don't do that. - That's how you die. - Ooh. - What's up? - I see more corrosion. - Oh. - [Greg] It seeped all the way to the bottom power supply. - Oh my gosh! Holy (bleep)! Holy! Oh my, what the? This has been sitting here for just ever just festering. (Greg laughs) It's like a cinnamon roll. - [Greg] Oh yeah, a really nasty cinnamon roll. Here's an interesting thing, we need to get to this screw here. - [Ken] It's just covered in corrosion. - [Greg] But it's still covered in actual liquid Dex-Cool right here. - [Ken] Oh my gosh. - [Greg] That is actual, still wet Dex-Cool. We're just opening it to show you guys what blew up in here. - [Ken] Right, we don't really need open it for the sake of this repair, but it's nice to show what broke. - Scalpel. - Yeah, scalpel. - Pliers, mayonnaise. - Mayonnaise. (laughs) - First off, I'll point out the no screwdriver label here with the lightening bolt. AKA, don't be using a screwdriver to pry one of these open. - Do you want like a rubber tool to open it up? - I think this will work. As long as I don't jam it into something we'll be fine. - All right. - Don't do this at home, kids. - Do it at your friend's house. - I actually don't see anything that. - I was gonna say, I don't see anything, oh wait. What's going on over, is that normal? - [Greg] That is probably not normal. Fuses look fine. - So now that we disposed of that disaster of a power supply, Greg's got the pump now. So what's next there, doctor Greg? - Well, on this pump is the two CPUs we're trying to salvage. The contacts on here are definitely corroded. You gotta be careful scrubbing those though. I decided to do the less damage, more than likely least damaged one. To build up the suspense, but that's okay. - Oh gosh. - Oh gosh? - Yeah. - Oh! I see crystals. - I would normally like offer to hold it, but like I don't have gloves. I don't want to burn my skin off. - All right, you ready? - Yup, here we go. - [Greg] Actually not that bad. - From the initial look, it's not terrible. - We'll have to clean up the capacitors here. It's still actively leaking. - Just an ecosystem of like wet. - Or get it outta here naturally. - All right, ready? - Here we go, three, two, one. Oh. - Well, I mean. (Ken laughs) I think it's salvageable, honestly. - [Ken] I think so too. - There's a good possibility that when we get this wet and start taking stuff and scrubbing it with a toothbrush, the capacitors are just gonna fall off. - It's like brushing your teeth, oop, my tooth just fell. - Exactly, that's exactly the same thing that happens there. - It's just decay. So I went out and grabbed some isopropyl alcohol 'cause I didn't have any and now Greg is going to continue with trying to clean off some of the corrosion. - We're gonna first attack the back pane, the logic board itself. The best idea would be to take the whole thing out, but I really don't want to do that. We'll do that and then we'll try to get all the Dex-Cool off the bottom of this, and then we'll attack the CPUs and try to save them. - [Ken] We secretly switched Greg's isopropyl alcohol with Folger's crystals, let's see how it works. - [Greg] Scooped out all the gunk in the back. - [Ken] Yeah, it was nice and brown. - Oh, it's delicious. - Paper towel full. - Forgot to clean the power supply cover. - And while you were doing that. - [Greg] We noticed that the anodization or the anti corrosion coating that's on it has been eaten away from it. - So there was a bunch of rust there and when he scraped it away. - Yeah, it's totally gone. - Different color, yeah. It's totally stripped, but it's okay now. - And what we're going to do is we're going to first get these heat sinks off 'cause we're not gonna need them for the new neat sinks. And after that, we're going to, I found that soaking them a little bit in the bowl first will help loosen everything up. So we're going to do that, see what happens. Doesn't really fit in this bowl very well. - The biggest bowl I have, I'm sorry. We can fill it up higher if you need. - We may have to. - I feel like we're on a cooking show now or something like that. Add the isopropyl alcohol and let it sit for 20 minutes. - [Greg] The nice thing is it also cleans the CPU die at the same time. Good thing iFixit supplies us with a nice plastic scalpel. - That's true, we do have this one. Not a sponsor for today but hopefully in the future, iFixit. Our real sponsor though is Linode and they're awesome. - Is Linode our sponsor today? - Yes, they actually are. And that could be the perfect segue. - Yeah! - So I had my miniature Power Mag G5 here with me today to talk to you about something cool. And we're gonna do that while I let Greg concentrate for a bit. But for real, my awesome friends at Linode helped make this episode possible and they can help you too.

All right, let's get back to the real size G5 and see how Greg's doing. - [Greg] I mean, it kind of looks like big blue boogers. If you notice the bowl is turning yellow. - I was gonna say, yeah, it's. - Yeah. I think we should probably attack the socket first while this bowl is turning yellow. This card I'm 50 50 on saving, without a supersonic cleaner. Which would clean this really fast, we don't have much of a choice. - Guess I gotta put one in the budget for next year. - Yeah, that would be nice. - Ultrasonic. - Ultrasonic. - [Greg] Nothing like going through half a bottle. - Eh, they're a dime a dozen. Okay, now I'm smelling it more. - This is where it's gonna get interesting. - How so? - Well, if I start scrubbing this and capacitors start coming off we might as well just throw the card away. - Well, capacitors didn't come off of this one. - No, cause it didn't have a whole lot on it. - True, true. - [Greg] Oh, that one just broke. - What, a capacitor? - Yeah. - Oh shoot, yeah. I mean, to be fair, you did warn us that that could happen. - Yeah. That one was the gunkiest one on here. - So the whole thing's not gonna work without that capacitor though, right? - It might. - Hmm. - You know, honestly, I might be able to carefully clean it. Oh, nope, it just fell off. So we're going to be building a single core 2.5 for now. - Thanks for sacrificing your parts for this G5. - Well, you know, it's not doing anything right now anyway. You don't have a soldering iron, do you? - [Ken] No, I don't. - Okay, so we're going to be removing the heat sinks that I put into my 2.7 out, plus my working and fried CPU and the working power supply which I've already verified works so we don't have to open it. And then maybe we'll get lucky and your computer will actually turn on. - [Ken] That would be awesome. - [Greg] Without a big spark flying out of it. - [Ken] Good times, except they're not. - [Greg] One. - [Ken] Giant ass heat sinks, holy frick. - [Greg] Yeah, these I think are the 2.3 heat sinks. They might be the 2.0. Now we just gotta get the power supply off, which I think I might be able to do with it on its side. This one, the RAM's in the way. That wasn't a problem on yours. - Yeah, I guess I took the RAM out. I probably put the RAM in my air cooled G5, which we put on wheels in a past episode. So we'll probably have to take the RAM out of there. - We're getting along through here pretty quick. It's almost like I've done this multiple times. (Ken laughs) - [Ken] Oh, okay. - Oh yeah, you can see the giant scrapes I just put into it. There we go, a fully functional AC Bell power supply. With dust included. - [Ken] Oh yeah, thank you, I've always wanted dust. - Yeah. So now Ken, we're taking the, I believe this is my fried CPU, off of this heat sink so we can put your hopefully good CPU on it. This is one of my favorite parts about these heat sinks. Solid copper block. - Ooh. - Yeah. - That's very nice. - Yeah. Ever wonder what a 2.5 G5 looks like? - [Ken] So that's what, oh cool. Got the IBM logo on there and everything, that's pretty sweet. - Yeah. So we need to get this heat sink off. Ow, that hurt. - So sorry. - Ow! - There's so many screws here. - I know. I should've probably kept track of 'em. Just makes it more fun to put back together. - Oh, totally. - So let's get the thermal paste on it. It's a little gummy, we might be all right. I usually use Arctic Silver 5. but I didn't have any. it should work. We'll find out. - That's kind of the catchphrase for some Krazy Ken's Tech Misadventures. - Yeah, when you see flames shooting out the G5. - It'll look really cool. - There we go. - There we go, yeah. Nice satisfying snap. - All right, Ken. - Final screw. - The final screw. - Look at that chonker. - You got yourself an air cooled 2.5 CPU. - Sweet. - Well we now stick that into the system and then we stick that in the system and then we plug it in and see what happens. - Do we need RAM? - RAM would help. - I'll get some RAM from the wheel G5. All right, let's put it back together. - Awesome. - I'll go get the RAM, you do the rest. - Me do the rest? (laughs) - So, Greg got everything put back together and the reason why we didn't show that process is because, well, we already showed it being taken apart so you don't really need to see it again. But if you really want to, you can watch the earlier part of the episode in reverse. Also what I did was I summoned my wheel G5 computer and took the hard drive and the RAM out of there for this. Greg, what else would you like to show the lovely folks? - Well, we got it back together. It's now a single 2.5, as we can see right here. I actually thought since this is now a single G5, we could customize it a little bit. - What are you, what? Oh, look at that, isn't that just adorable? - So, it's almost back together. We got to put this back on and put the fan back in and then we'll be ready to see if it blows up or not. - Even though that sounds like a big victory, which it still is, that's only like half the battle, right? 'Cause there's still more we have to do on the calibration and software side of things after this boots up. Well, after it turns on, so, all right, fingers crossed. So now this is the first real big test for this project. - Uh, Ken. - Yes, Greg. - You're gonna be plugging this in, right? - Does it have to be me? - Yes. - Okay, I'm gonna be plugging it in. I'm just a little scarred because the last time I did it exploded. (laughs) So, what I'm gonna be doing differently though, is instead of plugging it in- - Oh, wait up. I'm gonna be over here behind this blast shield. - Greg, there is no blast shield. - [Greg] Oh, come on, man! We got this, you can go behind, hide behind the giant tinfoil shield. - I might be all right. - So we're gonna go into the inlet and we're gonna go into the outlet with the switch off. Now we're gonna turn on the switch. - Pop! - You ass (bleep). (Greg laughs) Don't (bleep) with me. (laughs) Time to boot it up or? - Yeah, yeah. - Now, are the fans gonna go really fast 'cause it's not calibrated? - Possibly. - Okay. Uh oh. - Uh oh? - We're not getting anything. This is a development. - So, sometimes when you put a G5 CPU in it doesn't seat properly and it will do what it just did. So I loosened the screws a little bit, pushed down on it. - Plugged the power in and it went click, click, so power's getting in the computer. - Yeah, and when we touched that the light lit up for split second, which means the board's got power. - Mm-hmm, you can do the honors, sir. - Thank you. Still dead. - Dang. Hmm, what could it be? - I don't know, but I think I'm gonna have to pull the CPU card completely out. - Does a dual core system, or dual processor system work with only one in it? - It should. - Huh? - I don't know if it does or not, honestly. - Maybe we gotta put both in to make it go, oh, hey, it's complete. - Yeah, and the problem is two different speeds. - That's gonna be weird. Is that gonna work? I guess we can, you want to try it? - We have nothing to lose. - That's true, but everything to gain. So we got two back in there now. - 2.5 in the top and the 2.7 on the bottom, I think. - We'll see if this works. - I don't know if it will or not but we'll find out. And power. (Ken gasps) That's a good sign. - Yeah. Fans are at full speed, which we assumed would happen. At least it sounds like they are. - Yeah. - Okay. - So now we need to tighten the CPU's down, get the whole case back together, wipe off the big giant X on the G5 cover. - I'm so glad you used dry erase marker. That wasn't as smooth as I thought it was gonna be, but. Good job, Greg. All right, so Greg screwed them down and we put the cover back on with the X still kind of faded in there, but. - And we also put the front and fan in and I wanted to test it one more time and see, 'cause it's going to need calibrated and I don't know if it's gonna pass with two different CPUs. - Right, and if we can't calibrate it it's not the end of the world, it's just gonna be noisy, so. - Yeah, let's see how noisy it is. - Let's do it. Wait, you didn't have the front fans in there last time? - No. - Oh, so it could be even noisier! - Yeah. - Yeah! Sorry, Steve Jobs, I know you don't like fans. - It's pretty noisy. - Okay, yeah. - Let's put this in there. - Gettin' a nice breeze. Uh, does it not need calibration now? - I'd say it still needs calibration but. - That's a lot quieter though. - Yeah. - Because it detected the lid was on? - Well yeah, that's part of it. (laughs) - Okay, okay. - When the cover is off there's an optical sensor blocker here, okay. - I never knew that. - So when you put it in. - That's pretty sweet. - [Greg] It automatically quiets down. - Every day you're a student. All right, yeah, let's plug a monitor in and see what we can do. So now we have the monitor, keyboard and mouse hooked up with the old school Computer Clan mousepad, one of a kind. It's actually on our Etsy store now, you can buy it. - Really? - Yeah, you can buy the actual one that's being used right now! And Kevin Bacon has licked it. No he didn't, I'm sorry, that selling point is a lie. Yeah, Greg, you can do the honors. - [Greg] Let's see what happens. - [Ken] We got a light. - That's really quiet. - Mm-hmm. - Like really quiet. It takes a while to POST. - Oh yeah. - It works great, Ken. - So, as you can imagine, we had to do a lot of troubleshooting and I won't bore you by showing you everything we did, but we did the basic stuff, resetting the PRAM, et cetera. And we also tried a different video card just to rule that out. Ultimately, we decided this is a CPU related issue. I'm going with CPU problem. - Well, at this point, since they're mismatched, CPU's. - We do have the dual processor two gigahertz ones in my wheel Mac. - But after that it's not really the same Mac anymore. I mean, the logic board would be and the video card would be. - So let's close enough, I mean, we. Do you want to try it? - Let's go try it. - All right. And if that doesn't work we just blow it up. - You know, this project really has turned into like a G5 graveyard. We're just like using the organs of the others. - There's G5s laying everywhere. - To make this one better, so. - Well, I don't know about making it. - Well, making it- - Run. - It's good enough. You took the dual 2.0 gigahertz ones out of there. Well, they're in here now. Want to try it? Here we go. - Let's see what happens. (computer chimes) - It bonged! - Holy (bleep), what? - [Greg] It bonged! - Oh! Oh wait, the video, the monitor's not plugged in. - Oh. - Yeah. - [Greg] There's no video, ah! - I was just patiently waiting. Holy! - Whoa! - It's like it's posted now. - I can feel a nice breeze. - Monitor's still not coming on. Ah, yeah, it just posted. - Okay. - I think. - Oh. - Hey! - Hey, there's my squirrel! Well, son of a bitch, it's working. Yeah, it's running leopard. - It's also extremely loud. - It is extremely loud. Yeah, I guess we gotta calibrate it. - Yeah. I mean, unless you wanna hear this melodic sound all the time. - Not really. - Not really? - So we gotta burn an image to a CD to do that? Do you know where to get the image from. - Macintosh Garden I think. - I love you, Macintosh Garden. All right, well, let's try it. So with the help of some conversion technology, he just transferred the downloaded files from his MacBook Pro, new MacBook Pro, to the G5 and then he used the G5 to burn a CD. It was ASD we needed, the Apple Service Diagnostic, whatever it is. That's what we needed, not AHT, Apple Hardware Test, separate. All right, let's try it, I'll hold down the Option key. - [Greg] Actually, hold down the C key right now. - Okay, yeah, we'll see what happens. (computer chimes) I just hope this calibration works, 'cause it's getting late. (Ken chuckles) I can just feel the whole like desk vibrating. Oh? Oh (bleep), hey. - There we go. - I have never, I've never seen this before. - Really? - Yeah, I've never used ASD. I love the old like serif looking font and everything. - [Greg] Yeah, they based it off the OS9 stuff, it's all classic. - All right, so I haven't done this before, but I do see a menu that says thermal calibration. Initiate? - Yep. - All right. Calibrate unit and starting calibration, this will take 10 to 30 minutes, calibration starting on CPU 0. All right. - Yeah, as long as the CPU's are good, it should. in theory, pass. - Okay, sweet. - In theory. - In theory, famous last words. CPU 0 and CPU 1 calibration passed, all right. Just hit quit, I guess. - Hit quit and we'll restart the computer and once it restarts, it should be quiet. - All right. I'm gonna have to fiddle with this software some more some other time, it looks fun. - So far so good. - Much quieter. I think it worked, man. Thanks to your genius power. And spare parts and my spare parts too. - Yeah. - Oh wow. That is much quieter now. Let's go to about this Mac and yeah, dual two gigahertz power PCG5 with four gigs of RAM. It's working, guys. We resurrected, mostly Greg, resurrected the G5 that exploded on me years ago. Holy crap. - It only took a new power supply and new CPUs. - RAM from the other computer and the hard drive from the other computer as well, 'cause that just wasn't in there. - So really the only thing left is the case and the logic board, but hey, it works! - But hey, it's good enough. Thank you so much for helping me fix this thing. Where can the fine folks find you? - You can find me over at my channel, Hrutkay Mods, where I do videos like this and mostly electronics, but a little bit of other things too. - Well, thank you very much, Greg, for all of your help and helping me save my G5. The world is a better place because of you. And if you guys like to stick around for more tech episodes coming out all the time I encourage you to subscribe to the Computer Clan right here. I love making episodes about rare and retro tech, new tech, and of course scam tech. And hey, if you like this episode, you know what to do. Thanks, and I'll see you next time. Catch the crazy and pass it on. (electronic music)",

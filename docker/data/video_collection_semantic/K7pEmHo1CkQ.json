    "transcript": "this is Acer Helios 300 for 2019 and it's a fantastic gaming laptop now if you've seen my channel before you may have noticed that I'm sometimes critical of Acers products they make some good stuff but they also make some kind of mediocre stuff for the greater part of my channel kind of Acer coverage I would say that I'm leaning more towards the not recommending a lot of Acer products but this one is a banger and it's fantastic so what makes this thing special its not just as price point it's a 1200-dollar machine but it's also what you're getting for that money it's so much better than I thought it would be because so many companies cut corners when they're in this price range so this device has an aluminum top surface and an aluminum keyboard deck the bottom panel as well as the back panel is plastic but this thing's just built really well for this kind of price point now they can figure this device with a good combination of CPU and GPU so oftentimes when you have a 1200-dollar gaming laptop one of the things that they'll do to keep costs down is to package it with a weaker CPU even Acer has done it in the past but with this thing you're getting a six core ninth gen i7 it's a very powerful CPU I did notice however that it is also under voltage I noticed this like previously in a different laptop the Razer blade but it's just strange like this was never done before in the past and someone decided to you know give people the green light now a lot of manufacturers are putting out devices that are under voted right of the factory it's a good thing and it's one of the reasons why the temperatures on this device are lower but it's just a little strange to me and the GPU and here is also pretty kick-ass it's the GTX 1660ti and basically any kind of game that you throw on this is going to run quite well if you're playing competitive shooters and you drop the graphic settings on it you'll be able to hit the maximum frame rate on the screen so the screen is 144 hertz they claim it's a 3ms response time which is probably an optimistic measurement uh but it's a very fast screen if you're used to 60 hertz screens this 144 hertz panel is a nice treat it's reasonably bright but screens are areas where companies often skimp on as well when they're trying to keep costs down but it's like the thing that you're looking at right it's the thing that you're playing your games on I feel like if you're not getting a good screen regardless of the price of the laptop you're not getting a proper device for 1200 bucks a good screen like this is really nice let's talk about thermal performance this machine has fantastic thermals in part due to the under-volt thing that I mentioned earlier but it also has a great thermal system it's got two fans and the thermals are good enough that it can maintain boost clock if you're running it on turbo mode now keep in mind that the fans are quite loud in turbo mode but you get excellent performance I do wish that there was just better control in that software like you get some degree of fan control but I feel like there should be more profile so you could adjust your fans little bit more precisely the ports on this device so there's 2 USB-As, 1 USB-C the USB-C does not support thunderbolt three but I feel like in 2019 I've kind of fallen out of love with what thunderbolt three kind of offered originally I really liked the idea of thunderbolt three with the ability connect to external GPU and stuff but we've seen how that stuff plays out I feel like it's just super expensive and not cost efficient to get an external GPU you also get an ear and a jack as well as your AC adapter hole on the left side I don't like the positioning of this it's not so much like a restricted airflow when you have the AC adapter connected it's more that the cable gets super-hot and that can't be great for things. Ah the speakers are located on the bottom they sound okay I don't particularly love them but inside you also have access to your RAM slots, you're SSD slots as well as your 2.5-inch HDD if you want to use that and you also have access to your wifi card as well as a very small battery this is a little bit bigger battery than last year's version but it's still a very short battery life I'm getting around four hours a battery life still the AC adapter as not huge so if you do need to bring this around it's a relatively compact power supply but yeah it's the battery life that you will require the AC adapter if you travel with it okay oh the inside I haven't talked about the keyboard and track by yet it's a good keyboard I like the way types I think a lot of people enjoy the feel of this keyboard it feels it's not that it's cramped it's like there's no border on the left and right of it because they have a number pad so it feels a little bit strange when you're using the WASD keys like you can feel the left edge of the keyboard right there but it's something you get used to pretty quickly and the keyboard and the hole is solid the back lighting on this thing so the unit i have is an Amazon configuration it does not have RGB lighting it only has this whitish blue light which actually like there are more expensive configurations out there with RGB lighting but this is just a simple white light the track pad it's a plastic surface and you do have to press the buttons a little bit harder than I'd like to activate the mechanism but yet a solid track pad using windows precision drivers nothing really to complain about it okay this device I'm going to give this thing the title of an MVP it's like the most valuable player when it comes to gaming laptops right now because not only is it given consumers a great device for the money for 1200 dollars you're getting a lot more with this system than a lot of competing systems but the presence of this thing the existence of a 1200-dollar device that is this good put a lot of pressure on other companies out there I'm not gonna name names but there are companies out there that probably looked at this thing and just they hate it they're like we can't compete this with our current devices so it makes other companies look bad if they're selling a similar kind of product for a lot more money Acer did a great job on this thing I mean its heavily improved year on year and I think they just knocked this one out of the park I like it. now im gonna mention one problem with this device or one potential problem with the device that I think people should be aware of when I looked at the price of this device online on Amazon I stumbled upon the older Helios 300 from 2018 and that was a device that are reviewed quite positively when I looked at the ratings it's got a 4-star rating people seem to like it as well but when you click on the spread you'll notice a handful of 1-star reviews and i clicked on those and I saw a bunch of people talking about thermal issues from the 2018 model and I remember in my old a review that it had good thermal performance not perfect but it was pretty solid and I remember a lot of other publications and other YouTubers came to a similar conclusion that the 2018 Helios 300 had good thermals but then why did so many of these 1-star reviews specifically mentioned poor thermal performance as the reason for their dissatisfaction with the product and I think it was because of an inconsistency in their manufacturing I think a lot of the older Helios 300s just didn't have proper thermals but I think with the 2019 model because of the under volt and it's an improved system overall I think there's gonna be way less issues with 2019 model but if you do pick one up and like I still highly recommend this device but if you pick one up I would recommend just testing the crap out of it at the moment you get it just to make sure you don't have a lemon because you don't want to be one of these guys dropping 1-star reviews when you can resolve it or avoid it by running some benchmarks the day that you actually get the laptop ok Acer Helios 300 great device I feel like they knocked this one of the parks there's very little I have to complain about it in fact I think because of the existence of this product a lot of competitors now have to kind of change their configurations or reprice their products at this 1200-dollar price point because it's that good yeah okay if you're looking for this thing looking for a 1200-dollar gaming laptop this should be on the short list ok~~~ hope you guys enjoy this video thumbs be liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time",

    "transcript": "oh now I realize I am super late to this whole trend of people gaming on CRTs again like it's 1785 and the main reason I've not been particularly interested is because I still distinctly remember how excited I was to get rid of mine as a child wow I can't wait to get rid of that big piece of [__] and I haven't really been able to shake that negative association with them yet until recently I've had a bit of a change of heart for some reason so I went on to everybody's favorite source of crap from some randoms attic and rustled up this massive little guy to see if I've been missing out or not but first today's video is sponsored by the awesome new deep cool assassin 4. now sure its performance may just be good as opposed to class leading but it makes up for it with really easy mounting and the thing that really gets my juices flowing about this cooler is how the fans are integrated into it look at this you just you pop them off and then you mount the cooler and then you just clip everything back in it's it's so clean and useful so if you want a good looking cooler that performs well and has some great quality of life improvements check out the Deep cool assassin 4 using the link in the video description [Music] thank you now the CRT in question is this 13-inch Sony Trinitron kev13 FM 12. now from my admittedly very limited research it seems like if it says Trinitron on it a CRT is likely not terrible but we'll see now despite being just 13 inch you can see it's got quite the long booty to it which means it's really heavy it weighs about 13 kilograms I think which is crazy for a 13 inch display now while we're around the voluptuous booty of this Trinitron let me give you some context for this video I happen to watch Independence Day on the weekend saw a bunch of CRTs in the movie booty I'm joking [Music] let's nuclear bastards Ian went yeah maybe I'm stupid for not trying this trend out earlier so let me go on to Craigslist and buy one now the reason that I got this one specifically was because well it was kind of my only option there was also a 32-inch Sony Trinitron but it weighed like 8 000 tons and wouldn't fit in my car so yeah I had to go with this little guy which initially I was very excited about I was like oh it's even a Trinitron but then I told my CRT Enthusiast friend about my new CRT who was a lot less excited about it for a couple of reasons the first one is that it's a flat screen which apparently makes CRT purists vomit in their mouths due to the geometry issues with it but that isn't even the biggest problem with the crd the this problem is the video inputs despite the fact that we have like a like a coax looking thing uh but in terms of video inputs you're only real option is this single yellow RCA now apparently yellow rcas are the worst video input ever because I think it was like mommar Gaddafi's input of choice or summon nice now the real reason is obviously more complicated than that but basically boils down to it being the bandwidth equivalent of trying to pass an adult male through a catheter tube now I remember as a kid plugging my consoles into TVs using this port and I didn't grow cataracts on my eyes but according to the internet and my friend it's a big No-No so basically the point is this is very much going to be my first look at CRT gaming some of you may be offended by it but that's more your problem than mine to be honest so with that out the way I'm gonna try and plug a gaming PC into this for some Modern C RT gaming but first we need to see if it works now in terms of system we don't need a whole lot of power so I'm going to use this tiny one I built in Japan now we just need to figure out how to connect it to this tiny little monstrosity because I don't think that system natively has a hole for these so I headed straight to one of the most depressing places in the world a dying shopping mall to buy a little adapter hey my journey into the pit of despair was successful it does look like a piece of crap but um I guess we'll find out soon enough I don't know I feel like this is gonna have more of an impact on the image quality than us having to use the Gaddafi connector or whatever interestingly it does have a couple of one star reviews seemingly because the shopkeeper didn't know what it was for but I did also order a couple more which should come tomorrow so I'll test those out later as well oh yeah well now comes the Moment of Truth we get to power up our Trinitron and see if it still works whoa that's quite the sound oh look at that the wine is it feels like it would make dogs go crazy but it's it's already making me go crazy I then spent a while dialing in the settings and setting HDMI scaling to get the best picture possible for gaming okay I see what my friend meant about geometry issues that's supposed to be a straight line wow that looks exactly how I remember CRTs looking back in the day which is not a compliment now one of the things that gets people really excited about CRTs in the context of modern gaming as far as I understand is that they're very quick response times and stuff which I don't know to what extent the little box we're using to convert the HDMI signal to analog is actually going to impact that but I'm curious to see what the gameplay feels like okay so the 13-inch monitor is very small and dark I think we need to turn the brightness back up because I can't really see anything there we go that's a lot better oh that doesn't feel particularly responsive now I'll try some other games later and it could be down to the little box but as it is here it's just okay the combination of the very low resolution with the uh tiny display means that fine details are basically non-existent you can't read any of the text like this is the first size of text that you can read in terms of that kind of information it looks not amazing also the sound is driving me crazy this thing is a real whiner it's just sitting there going at me the whole time and I really I really don't like it and the thing is it's not even just because I'm sitting close to it now it's room filling no matter where I stand in my office I just hear them and with my skepticism very much still in place I decided to try another game setting video settings is a a real Joy on this display but after getting through the menus aside from a couple more legibility issues I can't read what button you want me to press to make it go away something special happened oh wow okay no never mind do maternal feels frankly telepathic like the the instantness of the responses is pretty impressive like this feels this feels really good now I think aside from just the Lightning faster response another reason why FPS games are so pleasing on this monitor is how it renders Movement Like This is a 60hz display but you would not tell that from just just the way the projectiles and stuff move across the display yeah there's something about the motion rendering that's really cool foreign this really gets you to want to do is play some old games on it things like Half-Life CRTs are so interesting because this is both the best and worst image ever there's something about the way that it renders colors and motion that makes it look beautiful but then it also looks terrible at the same time either way I kind of get why people like it it's pretty cool and then after spending quite some time playing a bunch of different games the other RCA to HDMI converters arrived for comparison's sake I decided to get the only two adapters from Amazon that wouldn't take eight months to ship this mini one came with all the cables you'd need and is USB powered whereas the big metal one uses a Woolworth with an annoyingly short cable but in return you get an S video out in terms of input latency I couldn't tell the difference between any of them they all felt Snappy as hell although interestingly when it comes to image quality both the ones I bought from Amazon looked markably more washed out than the one I bought from the pit of despair and it doesn't even need any external power the final Quirk was in terms of image scale both the ones from Amazon would fit with seven percent HDMI scaling whereas the shop one didn't quite fit even at 10 and with my preferred adapter chosen I decided to compare the CRT to an OLED now obviously just firing up the OLED it's clearly a completely different animal for one I can actually read the text and um it's so vivid looking in my mind I was like wow there's definitely gonna be something missing in the OLED and the thing that's missing is that I I can't not see anymore although still I would say I I do think the CRT has a slight Edge in terms of motion rendering oh not even a slight Edge the CRT definitely has an edge when it comes to motion rendering that's pretty cool that's the main advantage that the CRT has is how it renders movement on the display that's pretty crazy the CRT renders motion decently better than this High refresh rate OLED but maybe that changes with the game designed for high refresh rate I I really will say aside from the fact that in most categories I'd say the OLED looks better and somebody who really has an issue with how modern displays render movement it's something that I complain quite a lot about the CRT blew my mind it's just different I then decided to do some PS5 gaming and after moving back from the OLED to the CRT aside from the OLED being better in a lot of aspects in terms of image quality as you kind of hope it would be the CRT handily wins when it comes to motion rendering in my opinion there's something just so much more natural about the way that a CRT handles movement which is kind of a sight to behold with that let me know about your recent CRT experiences in the comment section down below and go check out that tiny Japan build if you have time and until the next video thank you for watching bye [Music] all right [Music]",

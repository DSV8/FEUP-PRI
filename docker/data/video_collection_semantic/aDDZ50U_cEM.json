    "transcript": "Listen, I'm not saying that I'm some kind of computer guru or a voice of judgment, but I will be judging using my voice to, it doesn't matter. The point is your favorite celebrities and creators have a dirty secret. This is absolutely disgusting. My God. This is a pro gaming setup. That fly there? That's right. They're hiding PC setups that are so janky and disgusting that even Luke would be ashamed. That's impressive. On this trip to the LTT rotisserie, we are gonna be roasting the nastiest, least classiest setups from your favorite YouTubers, celebrities, and streamers. And by the time we're done, I am not gonna be on anyone's Christmas lists. Yeah, probably not. I don't think you're right now. Except the Christmas list of our sponsor. Build Redux. Don't worry about screwing up your build. Let Build Redux do the screwing for you. As in putting in the screws, screwing together. Anyway, the point is you can get your dream machine shipped right to your doorstep by checking out Build Redux at the link down below. Why don't we kick things off with Annemunition? A Twitch streamer who in person told me that she learned how to build a PC from me. I actually can't believe it's gonna be that bad. I suspect this one's gonna be pretty good. Yeah. That's pretty sick. That is sick. Too much. But I'm assuming that's because of separation between her gaming computer and a streaming computer. Yeah, and Wendell has a KVM that I think would be perfect for a setup like this. You could just have your keyboard, mouse, and display plugged in to both computers at once. Little bit of roasting does have to happen here. Do you really need a gaming grade keyboard for your stream PC? I'm suspecting, especially because the mice look really similar, it might just be her previous set, which is fairly valid. Got the UPS though. Taking care of your stuff. Good call. That's a good one. I like it, Anne. Didn't skimp on the UPS. Yeah. Got the display set up for the mechanical keyboards. I'm pretty sure that's IKEA. I thought these were supposed to be bad though. We started with someone who learned from me. Oh wow. Okay. All right. Now let's go to someone who didn't learn from me, but did take a computer that was built by me. Oh my God. I think the pixels helped. The salt shaker. Is it because he's really salty? What is with these potato quality pictures people sent? I thought these are professional content. I think he's waving, but you like can't even tell because it's so pixelated. This is some crap cable management. There's even like an unplugged power cable just hanging there. Unplugged USB cable right here. That might make sense. Maybe. Oh my God. We saw that the same time. Oh man. This is what happens when you're socialist and you give away all your money. I just can't think of another reason to use a clamp as a speaker stand. Also, most people will angle their speakers up toward their ears. You angle it the other way. You're angling it to fire into the table, my brother. Ah, there's the computer. The left leaning piece. Hey, what's this other computer? Have you replaced the computer I gave you already? There's nothing even plugged into it. Yeah. Linus made my PC, but he's not using it. Yeah, but he doesn't even plug it in. He doesn't even pretend to be using it. Founder of One True King here. Whoa. That does look pretty good. That looks very- Ah, wait. Oh, whoa. I thought you said the rat's nest was only visible on the one side there, buddy. Whoa, dude. He's working here, you know? Yeah, this is hyper functional. UPS though. Oh, nice. These could still be for work. You don't know. I happen to be a shoe enthusiast. We've got the green screen right here just in case you need a green screen. That is a completely unacceptable amount of mousing space. Oh yeah. You could put that mixer somewhere else. What do you need ammonia wipes at your desk for? That I genuinely don't know. Whoa. I don't think the two thumbs up belongs in this picture. And the cable mess is quite the mess, but this is also a production area. So I'll give him a little bit of credit for that. Does it go under? Yeah, I think it goes- Is the green screen raised? I think it goes under the green screen, which is more of a green mat on the floor. Shout out UPS though. Yeah. I'm kind of feeling Hank Green next. It's classy. If you take the plants away and the production equipment, this is exactly what I would expect from like a middle-aged dad, including the printer. Love to see it. Got that one page on there ready to go in case you need one document or more likely because your kid stole all the other printer paper. I don't see the computer. Is it just the iMac? Oh. Do they just take the standoff and mount it? It's an iMac. Yeah. Might need to pick some things up off the floor. Is this acoustic treatment on the bottom of these shelves? I don't think that was the most effective way to do that, sir. But you are rocking this chandelier. And the woodwork is really cool. Like those walls and the shelving units are really cool. Yeah, who would use Apple's included mouse? I agree with that. Man, that thing sucks. It looks like he might need a bigger desk pad. Yeah, Hank, if you need a new mouse pad, just let me know. We've got you covered, okay? Let's do baby no money. Fellow British Columbian actually did not know that he was from here. I didn't know that either. Nor had I ever heard of him before at all. Really? I know, I know. I was just in New York. Yvonne and I were playing a game called every musician who shows up on a billboard in Times Square. Have you heard of them or not? And we both lost every single round. That stained glass. I believe that you have no money. The magic gathering play mat as a desk pad is a classic maneuver. Is this a pair of wired AirPods? EarPods, yeah. For gaming? He's got those headphones right there. Why are the EarPods on the keyboard? Why are they both? It's kind of fascinating that a musician has like the worst audio setup. We've seen so far. Goes to show you streamer culture and like gear envy has gotten out of control. Yeah. Oh, this is a totally different setup. I do appreciate that the audio setup has massively improved. Yeah. Really nice headphones, really nice speakers. What is this? I don't know what that is. Kind of looks like a base station of a soldering iron or something. Yeah, or like something you'd use to like cook. Piece of industrial equipment. Yeah. That's an unusual sticker to decorate your space with. I do not like the power strip right where your feet are maneuver. Oh, oh yeah. Look at that. You gotta do what you gotta do. Yeah. Trying to throw shots from the peanut gallery. Leave them alone. This is totally different again. He's still got the printer. Maybe the DM will reveal something. Take some cursed photos soon. But some things are migrating from setup to setup. That printer is, I think that's the same as before. Oh, so maybe this is the setup evolution. Yeah, it's got the same calendar, same monitor, same printer. Is this a beaker of milk? That's a candle, my dude. Ah. All right. Okay, so this must be the current setup. This must be the current setup then. How about Wendell from level one techs? He's either gonna have the sickest setup or he's gonna have the equivalent of having his car out in the driveway on cinder blocks. Okay. Love it so far. It's the sickest setup one. Yeah. With the custom wallpaper, he doesn't have enough monitors. So this is a spare monitor in case one of these doesn't work properly. I'm liking this chonky keyboard. It looks like a streaming card. Oh my God, this mouse pad though. Tux looking through the window. I'm loving the camera peeking through. Is it mounted on wood? Camera's mounted on a cardboard box. If it works. Yeah. No side panel. Okay, that's not quite cinder blocks. Oh, the tape is literally, he taped it to the thing. Oh, wait, what? That's how it's staying on. Wait, this is suspended from the... What the heck? Also, Luke. There's another computer back there. That is not propped on a cardboard box. Oh, wait, what is it? It is propped on a cardboard box and a book. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What about second keyboard? I didn't even notice that. Love that the sticker's still on the laptop. I really liked that it has like extreme streaming card energy, but it's actually just his setup. This guy is just going to be trolling. It's going to be a PlayStation. I didn't immediately jump to that. I assumed it would be like very perfectly set up though. I am so angry that he's running a windows XP wallpaper. I hate that he has that tray right in the middle. Really, no mouse, Austin? No keyboard, no mouse, but like framed or whatever that is, Pokemon cards? You need your paper shredder like right there. He's got the sponsored blown apart phone in a frame, but not on the wall. In fairness to him, young kids, does he have time to mount things to the wall? Probably not. Does he have time to get a mouse and a keyboard and not directly use the laptop and get two monitors instead? I feel like he does. I feel like it might save him time. Does he really have his key lights bouncing off the wall? Now he's better when it comes to production stuff than me, but my understanding is that's already a diffused light, right? Andy, is that necessary? More diffused, okay. Honestly, I'm a little disappointed. I'd be happy to come and do a makeover. Yeah. Derbauer. It's either going to basically look like a workshop or be like immaculate. No, I think it's going to be a mess. All right. It's immaculate. That's a lot of cable mess back here. It's not that bad yet. It could go into something. You can't tell yet. That distro block though. Good gravy. He's actually running a Dominus. This may be the only one of these in operation. This platform was so stupid. I'm not convinced Asus did more than one tiny production run of these things for like influencers and reviewers. Other than what appears to be like a wrench or socket kit or something. Yeah, some kind of toolkit. That is clean. Oh, that's less clean. I hazard to say like minimalistic. There's obviously an immense amount of focus on what is inside the computer. Yeah. Nothing else matters. Nope. Is the camera mounted to the wall? That's kind of cool actually. No, I actually don't think I'm into that. Why? Because if you need to adjust it, you get to put four more holes in your wall. My notes say he's Drake. You know who Drake is. These pictures are paradox customs. We have toe proof Drake actually uses this computer. Okay. Wow. I hope you got noticed. Oh, we built a PC for PewDiePie. Hey, we got noticed. I hope we got noticed too. Thank you Linus. Oh. I really, really, really liked the treadmill. That commitment to personal upkeep. Love to see it. He's got a little bit of art to brighten his day. Rocking the laptop stand so that you have space for your sunglasses. And this is about what I second laptop stand. Like the cables aren't super managed at all, but they're a little bit managed and they're probably very easy to swap in and out. It looks like a place where someone who does work. I don't think those sound panels are really doing anything at all. Is he trying to set a record for like biggest oscilloscope collection? Is that a radio? My friend. Spotify? Man, he's told me his space is really small, but I had no idea how small it was. Yeah, is that where he does like all his- This is his whole studio. Whoa. Oh my God. You can put this on the wall at least. That's the OG gold one too, isn't it? So there's like so few of those and he just has it in a box. Just in a corner. Oh, whoa, we get a video tour. Oh, we try to. Oh, that's an unfortunate freeze frame. Oh. What is with this video file? Some painting I drew like 40 years ago. He did that. He did that. Okay, that's pretty cool. That's very cool. Oh my God. What is up with that travel size Bluetooth mouse, sir? That's unfortunate. So wait, did he paint his background? The background is drawn by my daughter. Whoa. Oh, wow. His daughter drew the desktop background. Family of artists. Love it. Very cool. Hardware unboxed. I keep saying they're gonna be janky and I keep being wrong. So I'm saying it's awesome. Wow. Full of cannot hases like that. I believe this was limited edition review only packaging for the 2990WX. Man, all the sick hardware boxes. Are these all computers down here? That's a lot. Yeah, it's a lot of cases. Oh my goodness. Air conditioned the gamer directly, right? How is this space so amazing? Also, is this a tool cabinet? It looks like it. Has a media console? With a wooden topper. That's kind of genius. Yeah, that's really cool. Whoa, holy crap. This is some efficient use of space here. But I have to ask. That is so cool. Can one man really use all these computers? Husky Starcraft and Rosanna Pansino. Here is mine and Rosanna's setup. Whoa, they're like actually shoulder to shoulder. Right next to each other. Wow. How do you guys avoid, you know, screen peaking when you're 1v1ing? I do think it's kind of a cool idea for streaming because they clearly have one camera at this setup. Okay. These monitors actually drop down into there so that they are hidden. So if you want to do a podcast or something and you don't want monitors in the way, and then behind us for our backdrop are all of these custom built kind of LED tubes or light tubes, whatever you want to call them. Wow. Those will change any color you want. That is a sick setup. Whoa. That's creepy. Man, I got to find consultants who do set design with rendering like this. All right, there you go. I mean, we're going to have to do Mark Rober, right? Rocking the pro display extra, man. Is this possibly the classiest setup we've seen yet? Oh, Hank Green's is up there too. No computer here. Yeah, yeah, I see that. I see that smart guy. Where is it? Because there's, the cable comes all the way underneath the carpet. Oh. Behind the closet over here. Very nice, very nice. Yeah, now I'm going to self roast myself and say- That you bought a Mac Pro? This computer sucks. And Linus, you explained to me all the reasons why that was true at the Creator Summit, which I can't remember, but- Can I just shout out Mark's house designer for putting in doors that people like me are comfortable using? I love that wall decoration. The back wall is super cool. That looks amazing. Yeah. Next, we're going to do someone who doesn't reply to DMs from me, but apparently does reply to DMs from my staff. Ooh. Now am I just- Very, very clean. I don't see a single, oh, is that one cable? I only see like one cable. What am I looking at here? Yeah, that's what I was trying to figure out. I thought it was like a light box at first and now I don't really think so, but it looks sick. And now hold on a second. Is this a roll down projector screen? And is there a couch back here? There's gotta be. Pretty sick space. Gotta love underwear, Linus, on the monitor. Oh yeah, that's helpful. Perfect. Is this a box for an HTC One? He might need it for a video. Yeah, sure. You don't know. Yeah, that could come up pretty frequently. We apparently have some pictures from Neil Blomkamp, the creator of memorable sci-fi movies like District Nine and forgettable movies like everything else he's done. Oh, that's not nice. It's a roast video. That's a big suction cup. Yeah. Found one of the few people in the world who actually bought one of those 32 by nine Samsung monitors. And thought it needed some fingerprint. Hey, it's gotta be more theatrical. I am actually kind of loving the blackout velvet curtains. If you want no light, that's the way to do it in the biz. Pre-built from ASUS. Like he's busy directing movies like District Nine and others. This is not how we store headphones, people. Maybe it's how you store those ones. We haven't even been that mean up until now. Why are you gonna be like this? Oh, is that, would they have done that for the pre-built? I don't know. Ooh, set up at work though. Whoa. And it's sick. He's got Chappie there. Wow. Which you are making fun of. Halo novels. Is this all like concept art books from different games and stuff? Seeing Halo, Rogue One, Mass Effect, Titanfall. You gotta love the film guy who has a Logitech webcam on a tripod. That is about the most overkill tripod possible for that webcam. Ultra extra super wide monitor enthusiast. Gotta have it at work too. That is a scuffed looking, I built this myself gaming PC. I like it. This thing has really seen some action. Got an HX750i in there. Kind of some LAN parties, sir. How much do you love that he got this in the foreground like this? Gotta create depth with the shot. We got another man who cares about his work. Very good. I see the UPS. Very good. Love to see it. Yeah, don't be mean to Neil. I like his setup. Coming up, Joe Rogan. Oh my God. What's with people buying this stupid thing? Do they have the wheels? Oh my God. I think they have the wheels. Is it that small of a desk? Does it just feel like a small desk? No, I think it's a really small desk. My notes say, oh my God. It looks like a 14 year old who just discovered atheism decorated the Titan submarine. John Green, let's go. Wait, this is... Okay. I do everything I do on a single laptop with no monitor or anything like that. Oh my God. They're not even aligned. They're not even snap to grid. Somebody tell them about folders. Yeah, that's rough. How do you write good books like this? Guess it goes to show you it's the mechanic, not the tool, right? The fault in our toolbars. Jack Black set up. Here we go. It's a lot of subwoofer. That's just two separate subwoofers for the two separate setups here. You know, you're the kind of guy, right? Who gets called. That's all I'm saying. I'm saying this guy takes phone calls. All right. Nobody calls me. You don't get called. We got Ludwig set up here. Just moved maybe. Okay, I thought this was a giant like bong themed thing, but I guess it's a key. Key to what? I don't know. The disposable cups, man. I mean, a lot of them. Who needs dishes? Monitor behind the other monitor I don't like. Okay, having a cable hanging across your mouse pad like this twice. Wait, is this your keyboard? Go behind the desk. What the heck, man? It's not even hard to get at. Red Bull can on the floor. Oh, what the? That looks like a stained ass chair. What did you do in that chair, sir? Got the pedals. I can respect it. Yeah, I wonder what he uses them for. How often he uses them. Cause there's no wheel. Hey look, maybe he just likes to use pedals as an input. I turn with A and D. I gas with my feet. Who drinks bottled water at home? Yeah, that's lame. It's actually gross. Like it actually tastes bad. You should get something else. That's not cool. Get a Brita filter. Got camera here. Stand's kind of broken, but. Quality camera holder. Gets the job done. Ew, don't floss over your keyboard. Nice mouse pad. That's a fun mouse. So he says it's a mouse pad. It says card, doesn't it? Card game. Pretty big about cable management. Card game, it's a play mat. Doesn't even have a proper mouse pad. Yeah, like. These are millionaires. Many of the people whose setups we're looking at. My foot pedals. It's not plugged in, but I like touching them. Cause it makes my feet feel good. The explanation is even dumber than what either of us thought. Who's who's that? Linus anime question of the day. I have no idea. Its Nami from One Piece, cmon. This is inside the PC. Is this just open? The top's just open. That's where the dust comes in. I'm meaning to cleanup. Oh, there's his wheel. There's the wheel though. There's the wheel. At least it's close. This rug though, I hate it so much. You're ruining your hardwood floors and you're ruining your rug. Quality. That's my setup tour. If you want to see more, like and subscribe. Marques. Of course, of course it's flawless. Yet another Mac Pro. Even his water bottle is color matched with his setup. I'm actually a little disappointed. Cables. Yeah. Everything else is like great. And then it's like, I've got 14 feet of extra cable here. You know what I should do with it? I should just dump it right here in a pile. See the thing is that if you look at my office, the aesthetics are worse, but I clearly didn't even try. But no one expected anything. There's a difference. This guy clearly uses his mouse a lot. That is some good mouse pad gunk right there. I like it. Got the shoe, got the hat. Never know when you're going to need to walk somewhere. One foot. Ready to play table tennis at a moment's notice. Ooh, Sara Dietschy. There's only one cable that makes this work. And it's an old Belkin VR cable that you can sometimes find on Alibaba. What does that even mean, Sara? It's this cable though, apparently? I guess. I don't even see what it goes into. The computer. If you're going to have a book prop up a monitor, that's the one. I think so. Ooh, liking the keyboard. Everyone's into keyboards these days. I really hate using my table as my mousing surface. Even if it does well with tracking and everything, I'd much rather have a mouse pad. Where's that your table? Which makes it a really, really bad idea. Sara, Sara, Sara. Everything about this is fine, except for the fact that my guy, you looked at your screen instead of your selfie camera. Rookie move. It's like a pet peeve of mine. People who are looking at their screen. We got, I did a thing. A little dead fly there. Very good. Has this ever been cleaned? Very good. Is this dog food? This poor play button. I mean, I know it's the new one and no one cares about these ones, but like this actually still offends me more than Electro Booms. Oh, there's the gold one right beside it. Hey, Luke, you know how much you love it when I touch monitors? Yeah. It looks like he rubs his face on his monitor. That monitor has been cleaned exactly as many times as this shelf. Dr. K's has gotta be immaculate. Not bad though. They're managed and from the front, okay, looking pretty slick. You know, some people just need the printer. I could see him needing the printer. What the hell is up with this mousing area though? Literally zero. That is the worst. Don't need it. You even have all this desk pad. Side panel off. Ooh, I don't like the storage. That's really bad. Not a fan of that. Yeah, that's not good. Is this supposed to be vibration dampening? The cables don't bother me that much, mostly because there isn't an insane amount of them. Yeah, and because they're masking taped in place, right? I don't think that's actually holding any cables. You think you're right. Simone Giertz. Okay. Okay. That looks like an incredibly comfy place to work. So maybe it's worth it. I would be sad about not having a keyboard and mouse, but like chilling with your dog on the couch. I'm also thinking we have a new contender for a classiest taste in decor. Immense style. Moist critical. Here we go. Woo! Yeah, baby! That's what I've been waiting for. That's what it's all about. Woo! Ear pods. Oh. I mean, he's not really known for his production values necessarily. What? What? Got the penis computer. Got the retro games. Whoa, with the Halo 2, I think it is? Helmet? That's our whole view of this. I don't know why he's doing the triple mirrored. I don't know. Maybe it gives you some kind of advantage when it comes to reacting to things the first. If I see it three times, I can absorb it faster. Ooh, Zach. Wow. A dad cave. What is that picture? That appears to be pieces of- It looks like laptop internals. Yeah, or phones or something. Oh, dbrand teardown skins. That was a collab with Zach. That's right. Got the 32 by nine monitor. Got the voiceover set up, just ready to go at any time. A post-it note, man. We've seen very few of those. I used to be like a mega post-it note guy. I would just write everything I needed to do for the day on a post-it note, stick it to the bezel on my monitor back when monitors had bezels. I think that's some form of like backup power. Yeah, being outdoorsy like he is, I could see him using something like a, it's like a Jackery-a-like, I think. Computer's got some wood under it for better airflow, I believe. Oh, I like to see that, LGR. I think this is exactly the right amount of cable management for a functional setup. Things are tied. Kind of tied together, but you could take it apart very quickly. Yeah. If it was anyone else, I'd be like, what? Floppy disks. Not one floppy disk for decoration. Floppy disks that look like they are actually being used. Also, the optical drive and not just an optical drive, but the front door of the case open because of the frequency with which you are using said optical drive. Love to see the UPS. Wow. Now, I too have a spindle of blank disks somewhere. Certainly not within arm's reach anymore. It's been decades since that's needed to be the case. It's got a nice folding X-Acto knife, I think that is. Tommy in it. Oh my God. That's rough. What the hell? That's actually rough. It's hard to tell from the image, but this looks absolutely disgusting. Mac which is laying on the floor. PlayStation 5 just on the floor. Just, that is horrible. You can't sit at that desk without your feet on cables. At least the play button is on the wall. This lighting here though feels like my daughter did it both in terms of taste and quality. I mean, we've got T-Pain. Oh, whoa. Is he playing a shooter with a controller on a computer? You don't necessarily a hundred percent know. Yeah, that is a computer. Nevermind. See you later. Hey. Got George not found. With a lighting switch for his room just on his desk. I'm actually down with that. George not found more like personality not found. I feel like not having the monitors on was like a tactical decision. I feel like he probably has a really messy desktop. Yeah, and he didn't really give us a look at the cables. Ah, I see them. Yeah. I see them. I think there's some hiding going on here. Yeah, you tried to hide everything about your setup, but we know it's not pretty. Here comes 100 T double lift. I can't say like the thick desk. Why do you have two speakers on the right? What the hell? At least it's an easy fix. You can literally just pick it up and move it. Don't say barely wireless mouse. Put the dongle right there. Is this for pennies? Yeah. You know what you need is a new desk pad. Maybe the new PCMR one from lttstore.com. Big collab collection we just did with them, guys. You're gonna wanna check it out. He's a professional gamer. Yeah. Oh, sorry. I didn't know that. This is a pro gaming setup? Apparently. I mean, yeah, it's well worn. Jschlatt, we've got another investor in StarForge Systems. Is that even a StarForge system? Beautiful setup though. Yeah. You managed to get your stereo speakers on the left and the right. So that's- Speakers nicely set up. Actually uses a stream deck. Some of our other setups here. Actually enough space for his mouse. Yeah. And your cat is in one of the three positions for cats. Just where cats go. On top of the computer, on the keyboard, or on your chair when you go to sit down. That's like- Perfect. Whoa. Cat be like, don't take it. Don't touch this. Don't touch this. Yeah, that's not his, thats the cats. Jay's two cents. His setup's going to be- Yeah, okay. That's pretty sick. Don't needa spend a lot on a desk. He does have the one completely inaccessible drawer unit in the back right hand corner. I don't know. Maybe they, you know, you put something you don't need very often in there. I'm trying to find anything to go after because this thing is amazing. Well, how many pairs of headphones can one man use at a time? There. Yeah, but that's an audiophile thing. Boom roasted, boom roasted. Actually has his play buttons on the wall. Love to see it. Let's have a look at Kit Boga's setup. Love the desktop wallpaper. Two mice and they're both cramped on like a tiny, like $1 unicorn most fact. Can't say I love that as much. We've got another. Not. Oh my God. It's a doom floppy disk. That's a flex. That's a flex more than anything. Okay, he's got the old mixer on the left, but he's got a go XLR middle and then something to the left of that that looks much the same. Is that because he like has to change? No, there's other ways. He has two cameras. What's happening? Oh, that's under the desk. Also, I think your adhesive for your acoustic panels is coming off. Next up, we've got Sapnap who sent a whopping 11 pictures. I mean, some people didn't send enough, but wow. That's more RGB than computer. What's going on with that speaker? Who's listening to that? I don't know. Massive amount of mouse space. You know, you start gaming, you kick this thing over to the left. You're ready to go. Man, with how many go XLRs are out there? Kind of makes me wonder. Why they're disappearing? Yeah, TC Helicon just is like, see you later. Yeah, that's what happens to your carpet, my friends. Are we getting a picture of this computer? Oh, here we go. Wow. Wow. That's a lot of RGB. Snazzy Labs. And it's not a Mac. It wasn't for the cables. It would look like a render. It's basic. The HP printer is as prominent as the, any other part of it. The Linus face and the windows logo. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Wow, look at that cable management. Not easy in a case like this. Mac guy showing us PC guys how it's done. Some Ordinary Gamers set up. Can confirm, that's a pretty ordinary gaming set up. Got your Kleenex. The custom plywood table on the left. It looks like he just kept going. My widescreen doesn't go far enough. Where the hell do you put your mouse? Where's your mouse pad? Also, I know this chair. Yeah, yeah. It's not a very good chair. The Costco special. Very functional piece of TV furniture. Yeah. Did you make it? These sides are very different. I don't think it's just perspective. Yeah. Ooh, Tavarish. Wow. With a killer set up. That looks amazing. It really does. I really like the purple too. Everyone needs to get on LTT store and get a proper size desk pad for their desk, okay? Oh my God, Tupperware also DMed us. Whoa. Love the plant on top of the computer draping in front. Okay, no, I was gonna say you managed to go anime wallpaper without being too cringe, but then I saw the one on the right. Sorry. Hey, two minute papers. Yep, I guess this is about all you would need to read really, really fast and enthusiastically. Vikstar. Oh wow. Okay, that's just showing off. Keyboard up in the top left. An unconventional move. I feel like I'm somewhere that I have to pay to be. Yeah. You know what I mean? TSM fanfan is up. Got the vitamin D supplements. Amazing. Got the copper bracelet for channeling your energy. Responded to this DM while brushing their hair. Got the Kleenex right there. Like right there. It's literally easier to grab Kleenex than it is to edit your GoXLR settings. Got these cute little cable management things with nothing in them. An actual Alienware gaming computer in the wild. Seen in the wild, yeah. I want you to look at something. You gotta open up a browser. Oh, okay. You gotta look at a video. 12 years ago. This is absolutely disgusting. This is rancid. Wait till you see the desk. This is not, this is a table. It's not the desk. Wait till you see the desk. Look at that desk. Okay, I'm sorry. I really actually don't think I can look at this anymore.

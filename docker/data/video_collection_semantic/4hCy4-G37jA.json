    "transcript": "(box slaps table) - What is this? Qualcomm 660 Smartisan OS based on Android. Hey guys, this is Austin. And today on Mystery Tech I can't read this box. - Oh, I will. Is this the Nut Pro 2? Are you serious right now? Or is Google Translate just way off? The Nut Pro 2. You bought it just because of the name, didn't you? I know you, you bought it just because of the name. How could you Kenjamin? - [Ken] What is called again? - You ruined my take, you stepped on my line. Oh, oh look, it's the pride and joy of an artisan. Ken, how much was this? - $350, why? You literally just spent $350 'cause you wanted to make a nut joke, is that it? (laughing) - Whose money did you shell out exactly? That's coming out of your Christmas bonus, sir. - [Ken] What? - All right, so Smartisan OS is a little skinned I guess. So can you tell me something about this? So this is a Japanese phone. - Wait, I thought you said you got in in Japan. - [Ken] No. - Oh, you never said that. - [Ken] No. - Oh, I just assumed. - Oh, I apologize. Ooh, yeah, that's it. You know, that actually did not do a bad job. I mean, it's not a great job, but that's not so bad. - It's a dumb joke. You can't base an entire product off of one joke, c'mon. - No, no, no. (sighs) (box slaps table) That wasn't even a good throw. The Boogie Board? This is like a Wacom but (bleeps) - [Ken] Wow. - I don't know, I don't expect you to get anything good for Mystery Tech. To... waste. That is actually pretty good if I could flip the phone around. (clears throat) Let's draw, let's draw Ken's hopes and dreams. - [Ken] Ah. (romantic music) What? (laughing) - I'm just going to erase that it's fine. Censor that one out, it's okay we'll try again. Matt, would you care to come over and draw Ken's hopes and dreams? That is actually pretty impressive. Ken is this what you always hoped and dreamed for? Have you always wanted one of these in your life? - [Crowd] Awwwwww. (laughing) (box slaps table) - That was heavy. Oh, oh I know what this is. So you guys may have remembered, what was it? Earlier this year we did a video on a very, very expensive iPhone case. Well this, this is sort of the next level. I'm actually kind of excited for this one. What?! A metal box are you serious? Hold on a second. Ohhhh, oooooh! Yo! Yo! What? What?! This is the case. It's grade five titanium. So I know these Gray cases are among the most luxurious and expensive cases that you can buy for any phone, but the fact that this comes in a metal box and it's grade five titanium. How much was this? - Okay, thank you for not maxing out our credit card. Read the user manual before installing. I'm not gonna do that. Oh, dude look at that! This is on an iPhone X, I assume it would fit a standard size Xs. That is ridiculous. How much is this? - Is it wrong of me that I kind of like it? I know it's obviously ridiculous and over the top, but I kind of like it. I mean that's cool, right? You're never gonna see another one of these ever. Is this the most expensive episode of Mystery Tech yet? I mean this alone is more expensive than most items. Oh, this title's about to be. Oh wow, that's a lot of numbers. (box slaps table) Oh wow a thing that's not total garbage. This is the Massdrop Mechanical Keyboard, the CTRL. Fully programmable with a heavy aluminum frame, customizable back lighting, dual USB-C, and PBT key caps. Alright, so we've got the keyboard. Oh, wow! Now that, that my friends is a look. Huh, okay. That is also really heavy. Woo now that is some RGB action! So one of the cool things about this keyboard is you can actually replace the switches individually. So say you want to have bronze in there right now, but you want to put blues on your WASD or something, you can totally customize that. Also the RGB, that's bright. So I actually personally kind of like something with a little bit less of that tactile sound. Sometimes it's nice to be able to sit in an office and do some gaming or some working without distracting everyone around you. - Yeah I'm gaming. It's called my job, Matt. You know this keyboard doesn't really feel... Is this chicken? Wow that's a lot of chicken. Um... (ping) (laughing) Why is there an Xbox controller covered in chicken? Wait, Greaseproof 1.0, oh! This is that one grease proof... oh that's gross. So, if you guys are unaware of this magical controller there is a Greaseproof Xbox controller, which I think was only sold in Australia. - Oh it's a giveaway? Wait did Sean hook you up with this? - [Ken] Yes. - Thanks Sean. Do I have to play with it? Can't I like wash it off or something? Aw it's so slippery. Aw man. (laughing) I mean the controller's working fine, but look my fingers are like sliding off the greasy sticks. Wait, come back I have a grease proof controller! Come back! So, if you're looking for a grease proof controller to eat chicken and play your Xbox slash PC games, then, you know, this is the move. It's also really good chicken, I'm just gonna... It's hard to eat with one hand though I'm making a mess. (chewing and moaning)",

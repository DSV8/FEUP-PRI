    "description": "The Umi Super phone has some powerful specs and a really low price... will this android smartphone compromise structural integrity to save on cost? You know we are about to find out. ;-)  We start with a scratch test on the screen of the UMI Super, then move onto the metal frame... Is the frame really metal? Some companies seem to be confused about what constituents metal these days... so its good to have someone keeping companies in line...  The flame test checks the glass thickness, and resiliency of the display, and then the bend test checks overall durability of the phone. Especially if you like keeping your phone in the back pocket of your jeans.   I was not paid for this video. Umi only supplied me with a phone. The opinions are all my own.   You can check Umi Super pricing here:  Amazon:  GearBest:    Specs of both phones can be found here:   *Umi Super Specs* Helio P10 Octa Core Processor Android 6.0 Marshmallow 4GB RAM 4000 mAh battery 1080p Screen resolution 13mp rear camera (5mp front)   *Galaxy S7 Edge Specs* Exynos 8890 Octa Core (or 820 Snapdragon) Android 6.0 Marshmallow 4GB Ram 3600 mAh battery 1440p Screen resolution 12mp rear camera (5mp front)   The camera I used to film this video:  The Lens I used for this video:  And this Metabones adapter:   *Follow me for updates!* Instagram:  Facebook:  Twitter:  Snapchat:  GooglePlus:   JerryRigEverything assumes no liability for property damage or injury incurred as a result of any of the information contained in this video.

    "transcript": "Up until today... every single phone that ive tested on my channel has been purchased by me. And I like it that way. It lets me be totally unbiased in my durability reviews. Don't get me wrong... I wont turn down a free phone to test, it just hasn't happened yet... Until today. Today a company called Umi sent me a phone they call 'Super'. The Umi Super phone. When they first sent me an email I was pretty shocked, I asked them if they even know what I do with phones... But they said they wanted an unbiased test of their device so I told 'em to send it on over. I totally respect that. The presentation is pretty awesome. It comes in a foam filled metal container. The container is real metal. I checked. Its interesting to compare the Huge price difference between the Umi Super and the Galaxy S7 Edge when they have relatively similar specs. Ill list the full specs in the video description. But lets find out if The 'Super' phone is as 'Super' as it seems. The phone feels very solid. The metal body and huge battery add some serious weight to the device. Like usual, lets start with the screen, I have a set of picks that tell me where the screen falls on Mohs Scale of hardness. This phone is using Gorilla Glass 3. So when I start to scratch the glass with my picks, I can see faint marks that don't rub off at a level 4, as well as a level 5. The scratch doesn't get super noticeable until level 6 and 7... but it still scratched early on the scale. The glass on this phone is much softer than usual. Normally a phone wont scratch at all until a level 6. I checked to see if my keys would leave any noticeable mark. But they didn't. So you're mostly safe. Keep in mind, that I have scratched all 27 other phones with the level 7 pick as well. That'll be important later on in this video. Umi says that the phone is a solid metal design... and judging by the sound my razor is making, and the little metal curly cues that are coming off the back... Id have to say they are telling the truth. Which... isn't always the case. The finger print scanner is coated with plastic, just like the Galaxy S7. Even after heavily scratching on the coating, it would still accept my fingerprint, and unlock the phone without any hesitation. So thumbs up for the resilient fingerprint scanner. All of the side buttons, as well as the sim card trey are made of metal. Its easy to cheap out as a manufacture and use plastic buttons. But I'm glad they stuck with the quality metal feel for the entire phone. Even down by the USB type C charging port the frame is metal. Now the top and bottom rear of the phone do have a plastic shield, I imagine that this is where the screws are located to open up the phone. We'll find out more during my tear-down video tomorrow. The rear Panasonic 13 Megapixel camera lens is made of glass. And is slightly recessed into the metal housing... but is still pretty close to flush. Either way, since it is glass, it wont be as prone to scratches as a plastic lens would. The front camera lens is incorporated into the glass screen, so that is protected as well. And down at the bottom, we have a notification circle where the home button is. This blinks different colors depending on the notification you have. Which is actually pretty unique. Much more interesting than just a tiny little LED at the top. Onto the flame test. The UMI Super has an 1080p IPS LCD display. Notice the little scratch that my level 7 pick left on the glass? Don't forget about that. We'll be back to it. When the extreme heat is applied to the screen, it will stand its ground for 15 seconds before the pixels go black, and turn off. BUT the pixels fully recover and are cool to the touch again within seconds. Now wer are onto the bend test. Ive tested over 27 phones now. And only 4 have failed catastrophically... This Umi Super does flex a little while I try and bend the phone from the back. But does not break. So it does not fail the bend test.. BUT when I rotate the the phone to see the front, I notice that the softer glass has cracked from the scratch that I made previously on the screen. Its rather unfortunate that the glass cracked from the flex... but this particular failing point; the cracking, is also very easily prevented. Even the cheapest of screen protectors would have kept the screen free from scratches, thus protecting it from cracking during the bend test. Even when flexing the phone from the other direction it still will not bend or break. It is very sturdy. There is a small ripple in the metal near the sim card trey, but that is easy to fix. The most unfortunate part of this test is the edge to edge crack... is that the digitizer is broken for everything below the line. So the top half of the phone will respond to touches, but the bottom half of the phone, the part below the crack, will not. So the phone is effectively inoperable at this point. I understand that my tests are rough, but they do give a solid idea of what to watch out for when you own your own device. With a solid tempered glass screen protector on this Super phone, it will be the king of all budget devices, and even hold its own against most flagships. In summary: get a screen protector, and this phone will last a long time. I will still tear down this phone and analyze the build quality from the inside. , cuz thats just what I do with all phones. I've opened up all the popular phones from the last four years on my channel. Just search the name of your phone, and the word 'JerryRigEverythig' on YouTube, and there will be a good chance that you can see the guts of your phone open for display. I always post behind the scenes stuff on my twitter, Instagram, as well as Snapchat! Subscribe if you want to see your next phone durability tested before you purchase it. Thanks for watchin!",

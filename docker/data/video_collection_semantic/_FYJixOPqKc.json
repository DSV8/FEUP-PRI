    "description": "LG V30 TEARDOWN video is HERE:  The LG V30 is finally HERE available for retail sale. Its been about 7 weeks since LG announced the LG v30. But good things come to those who wait... Or do they?! There is only one way to find how how durable the LG V30 is, and thats with the systematic durability tests from JerryRigEverything.  I will take this brand new retail version of the phone and scratch it with Mohs scale of hardness. Assess the different build materials and ports of the phone, and finally check the structural integrity and waterproofing of the LG V30 with a bend test.  What do you think of this phone? Is the LG V30 a success in your eyes? Let me know in the comments.

    "transcript": "The LG V30 is one of the most feature-rich flagships of 2017 With so many smartphone manufacturers dropping useful components, It's nice to finally get my hands on something with all the bells and whistles this is the retail version of the phone that I purchased myself here locally And it's time to see if the LG V30 is durable (Intro) Now you might have forgotten about this phone since it was announced seven weeks ago, and only now becoming available to purchase Let's hope it's worth the wait. The scratch test is first. Frederic Mohs designed this scratch test back in 1812 to differentiate between different minerals the six inch display is covered in Gorilla Glass five Plastic wood scratched at a level three, pure sapphire would scratch at level eight or nine, so when the screen of the LG V30 Scratches at a six or seven it's to be expected. The iPhone 8 and the Samsung Note 8 both scored the same down at the bottom of the phone there is no home button it's located around the back of the phone due to most of the Front surface area being dedicated to the screen which I am a fan of. The closer we get to screens filling up the entire front of the phone, the better. Up at the top of the phone,we have the front facing five megapixel camera Under that same Gorilla Glass 5, so no damage to the lens will be happening here. The earpiece, which actually doubles as a microphone when recording video in loud envirements. Is recessed pretty far into the phone body. The grill is metal which is good But that recess is the perfect spot for dust and dirt to collect. Speakers are magnetic as well So if you work around metal shavings like an auto mechanic Welder or bank robber metal shavings are attracted to that speaker magnet and could get inside shredding that speaker cone Blowing the speaker so having a metal grille with small vent holes is a good thing for people with physical jobs But it would be easier to keep clean If that grill was more flush with the surface of the glass like on the iPhones or the Samsung's instead of a gaping hole On the back of the phone we have the glass covering that Wireless charging. The LG logo at the bottom is recessed under the glass so no scratching it off down here Same with the V30 logo in the center of the phone It's also under the glass and will never rub off or get damaged ever. One thing that can be damaged though is the fingerprint scanner Some fingerprint scanners are unscratched like on the iPhone or the Oneplus 5, but this one can be damaged It's pretty safe to say that with normal use the fingerprint scanner will never get this scuffed up But it's also Unfortunate that after the abuse, the scanner is unable to read my fingerprint anymore Constantly displaying, \"The sensor needs to be cleaned\". And also for the record most other phones survive the same Level of abuse and still function just something to keep in mind don't let the scanner get scratched It'll still work as a button of course just not a fingerprint scanner I went incredibly in-depth on this dual camera setup during my LG V30 tear down video Popping open the camera unit itself to look at the pretty incredible: Ten Bit Image Sensor I'll link that video in the description if you want to see this phone reviewed from the inside It is good to know though that the exterior of the camera is protected from scratching No plastic to be found, even the frame around the lens is metal Continuing our search for premium materials brings us to the sides of the phone and judging by the sound of my razor blade (Sound Of Metal Scratching Metal) We're looking at pure metal. The nice thing is that it's not painted metal either so any scratches Or drops will just expose more silver, the same color keeping this visible damage to a minimum The volume buttons are also made for metal and up here at the top of the phone next to the headphone jack This solid metal. The antenna bands are plastic, but that's normal along the sides of the phone We have our SIM and expandable memory tray. I do like how LG kept things simple and didn't force Any extra unwanted? Buttons on us like Samsung did with Bixby. I wouldn't be opposed if there was an extra programmable button along the side as long as we get to choose what it does like activate the camera or mute button or maybe a More useful voice assistant the bottom of the phone is metal We have the loudspeaker holes and the USB C port all of which are water-resistant jumping back to the 6-inch 1440p OLED display we find that 10 seconds from my orange lighter were enough to permanently damage the pixels which turned white and never recovered Personally I do prefer LED displays over LCD displays the absolute blacks make videos look super good So I'll forgive the non reviving pixels It's also pretty safe to say that I'm probably the only one on the planet dealing with flame damage. The LG V30 is IP 68 water-resistant. The same level at the Samsung Note 8 and one step above the iPhone 8 all of which were released this year during the Structural Ben test we checked the frame of the phone for weak spots as well as checking to see if the Flex Compromises the waterproofing adhesive around the edge of the glass panel There is a very minor flex to the phone when bent from either side But there is no separation of either slap of glass the adhesive holds it tight and the phone remains structurally sound Surviving the bend test no matter what side the phone is flexed from. This is a solid premium feeling phone on every single surface I'll give LG a thumbs up for this one while Apple Google Essential and sometimes Motorola are pulling useful features from their flagships LG is still here Alongside Samsung cramming every useful thing they possibly can into the phone while keeping a solid durable build This is daily driver material for sure check out my teardown of the LG V30 you haven't already. The aerial shots I got of New York City while using the rear camera are pretty impressive Come hang out with me on Twitter and Instagram and thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around",

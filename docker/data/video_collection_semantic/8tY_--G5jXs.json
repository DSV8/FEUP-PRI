    "transcript": "- Hello welcome to This Is. Today, Matt, we have some random (oof) we bought on Wish that's already coming out of the box. This is a great start to the video. - It is great, especially because we ordered this stuff roughly seven, eight months ago. Surprisingly, there's actually not a ton of Switch accessories on Wish. I thought there'd be way more. But what there really is- have you ever sat in a chair before? - No, no, sorry, go ahead, go ahead- - Okay, so there's like four accessories that they just repost about nine million times. But they're all pretty much the same exact thing so- - What are the, what's the joy pad? Is this an actual full joy con? - This is supposedly a- (laughs) Already. - [Austin] Oh, what is that? No. - [Matt] Already. - [Austin] No, no is the answer, no. - [Matt] So this is the gaudiest looking thing that I have ever seen. Now they do have less ugly one, but I figured if we're gonna do this we... - (recoils in disgust) I thought I had them on, I had to like click it like one stage farther. So I guess they do actually work, wait so if I detach them does it work? One is dead, but yeah they actually are confirmed wireless, okay that's nice. - That, all right, already that is way more than I thought we were gonna get out of these. So we paid 33 dollars and 12 dollars for shipping. - Ohhhh. - So we paid the exact amount- - No no no, Joy-Cons are expensive though, if you get a brand new pair of Joy-Cons, I wanna say it's like 70 dollars. - [Matt] It's 70?! I thought it was 50! - [Austin] I think they're like 40 bucks each or 70 as a combo. - [Matt] What?! - [Austin] Very expensive. So there is some use for it, so if I flip it around you can see, that it actually does have a little bit of like a uhm- - [Matt] The grip- - Grip yeah, - But it feels so (oof) with that plastic. - Okay here, just close your eyes for a moment okay, this is the sound of the Switch plastic. (fingers rubbing on plastic) This is the sound of the Joy-Cons. (fingers rubbing on plastic) It's just very like, I mean- (tapping plastic) It's not the worst thing, but it does not feel up to Nintendo quality, why are you looking at me? - I'm confused, if it's charging, - Uh huh? - [Matt] Why do they include a charging cable, and why is there micro-USB on the sides of them? - It's an extra benefit Matt, there's multiple ways to charge, actually I mean it's clearly working off the controller right? - Yeah, all right so I'm already impressed with these, that they in fact just worked. - Here jump into a game, see how they actually feel. - [Matt] This is the true joy of Switch. - [Austin] Yes. We're switching up the game. - (high-pitched mumbling) - This is, it's this this is- - It's this island, but it's like, it's this is-land. - That's clever, - Yeah, - That, that's clever. - Yeah. It works, but it's definitely not, like I had to press it a couple times. - [Austin] Okay, so basically don't buy weird fake knockoff Joy-Cons on Wish. - [Matt] All my rotten turnips. - [Austin] Enhance Jimmy, can you enhance? There you go, just enhance, enhance, there you go. You know what's not rotten, a fake Nintendo Switch Pro Controller! - I thought that we had a better segue than this. - No we don't. - [Matt] Because- - We have no segues, I make them all up. - [Matt] Okay. - And they're all bad. (aggressively opening cardboard box) Can't Lamar it, that's Lamaring it. - Ow! - That's definitely Lamaring it. - Oh! I'll be right back. - Did you actually get yourself proper? - Yep. - [Austin] That is, that's just a Switch Pro Controller. If you're trying to tell me that this a knockoff, then I'm gonna tell you that they just stole the design and re-did it. The grips feel pretty similar, I mean mind you I haven't used a Switch Pro Controller in a little bit. That's actually really impressive. (clicking buttons) That maybe sounds a little bit cheaper, but the buttons feel great, the sticks feel great. - This thing sliced me pretty good. - I mean you did aggressively open the box, and that- - [Matt] Lamar told me to. - [Austin] What we've learned today is that uh, the Joy-Cons are fake, the Pro Controller's pretty real, we're gonna try to fire this up, but it's basically a normal Pro Controller. - [Matt] Everyone knows and loves Amiibos right? - No, I think they're dumb, I don't have any. (intermission beep) - With Amiibos, they're basically just an action figure with an NFC chip in the bottom of them, which gives you cool stuff in-game. Nintendo actually sells just trading cards, so you basically get the Amiibo but, you don't have to have the figure. So, it takes up less space, you know if you just want the item, and they were pretty expensive actually. Individual cards were going for like hundreds of dollars, we bought this pack for 7 dollars. - What do you think that you purchased? - So we actually purchased Animal Crossing ones. There was Zelda. - [Austin] Look at all these Animal Crossing characters. - [Matt] (audibly sighs) - They're all Zelda. - They're all Zelda, okay. - They're all Zelda. - So Zelda was one of them, because- - So you're trying to tell me that when we bought something on Wish, we didn't get what we paid for? - No. - What? No way! Do we have a copy of Zelda? - Yeah. - You have one? - Yeah. - Oh look at that! - [Matt] Before we do anything technical, let's figure something out real quick. - I don't think there's anything in this. - Wait wait. - Is there like a tiny thing. - Yeah there is! I guess how big does it have to really be? Cause like here's part of it here like, but there is in fact actually something in... - Okay cool, so we didn't completely get scammed by Wish. - [Matt] So let's try it on this guy. - Okay well these are great, really working very well for us right now. - [Matt] Yeah, oh okay. So, they scammed us. - I mean look, I'm willing to chalk it up that there may be something we're missing here, and I guess if you wanna cheat a bunch of Amiibos and get the stuff in the game I mean, I'm sure they just cloned the Amiibo data into the cards, but uh we're clearly too stupid to figure out how these work. (Matt laughs) - I don't understand like if it does, if you are gonna scam it, which again I'm not willing to say that we're not totally dumb here, but like why go through the effort? - I bet they do something I think we're stupid. But you know why we're not stupid? Cause we have one more item. - It's true! - Matt, why do we need this next item? - The Switch does not have Bluetooth support for headphones built in, and so what this is, is a little Bluetooth adapter, these things are all over the place, it just clips on the bottom here, now you have a Bluetooth receiver that goes to your headphones, um, it's kinda nice, it does have a little right angle adapter, it, welp. - [Austin] Does not work there. - [Matt] You can't use it with your stand anymore! So we'll just, we'll do that. This is goin' great guys, it's goin' great. - This is going really good, really good. I'm really happy that we spent, I'm sure, lots of money on Wish for all these items. - So before even testing these, - Yeah. - I already know that we shouldn't have gotten these. - [Austin] Yeah. - [Matt] Cause this was like, 28 dollars plus like 10 dollars of shipping, something like that I can double check. - Kind of expensive. - But it was no, once again no cheaper than um, if we had just gotten a real one from Amazon. - [Austin] I mean, about the same price as you can get one on Amazon, but then why would you wanna wait four months for your item to show up? - [Matt] Right, right it took months to get here. If it doesn't work we are SOL, like, Wish isn't gonna return these. - [Austin] Can you actually try to see, do you have headphones? - [Matt] Um, I do, I have Airpod Pros, but I'm embarrassed to use 'em because, you guys just got done telling me how I shouldn't be using my Airpods, I should be using my Samsung Beans, but I don't have Beans. So what is actually nice is it has A and B. - Ohhh, interesting. - [Matt] That's actually a decent feature. - That's very cool. - I have no idea, is there even an LED, okay. - I feel like Nintendo could flip a switch, and turn on Bluetooth audio, maybe it like interacts with the Joy-Cons or something. - [Matt] So it does show up, USB audio, - [Austin] Yeah, so the Switch- - [Matt] Oh there- ay ay ay. - They're syncing, and connected. - Connected. - Connected, all right cool. - And it uh. - Right, do something on, oh! I heard- - [Matt] It says FBC. - It works, I hear Legend of Zelda in my ear. But it's fine, I mean it's usable, certainly there's always a little bit of latency when it comes to Bluetooth, but this is working. - It died. - And if you forget that little dongle, uh everything's being powered by the Switch, you're pretty much up and running. So this at least seems to be fine, um, the rest of the stuff I'm not so sure about. The controller, the Pro Controller's good. - [Matt] I didn't look to see what we spent on the Pro Controller hold on. - I mean I'm sure, cause the Pro Controller I believe is also 60 or 70 dollars, the Nintendo is quite expensive. - [Matt] Okay, so the Pro Controller is a good deal, it was 23 dollars and 12 dollar shipping. - Okay, okay. - Gladly gladly paid 35 dollars for um, so what, half off. - Half off. - Yeah. And this feels really good, a lot of times I've seen with like the cheap joysticks um, - Mhmm. - They get like kinda like sticky, - Yeah. - [Matt] It looks cool too, like it's straight up the Smash Brothers design. - Everything else though, not so hot. The Bluetooth adapter is fine, except it's just really not a good deal, and the shipping times on Wish aren't really worth it. The Joy-Cons are just not particularly worth it, I mean if you really need another pair of Joy-Cons, but honestly I think there are better options out there, that aren't so cheap feeling. And these Amiibo cards, look if you're really wanting to get into them, yeah I guess the artwork is kinda cool on them, if they work, but like eh, I dunno I- - [Matt] I'd be like, to me the coolest part about like this whole package is that it came in like a leather pouch but, - Yeah. - It doesn't even keep 'em. - Mildly cool. But you know what else is mildly cool? Subscribing to This is to make sure that you're always kept up to date with the latest and greatest of our mildly cool content, you can also subscribe to other channels, but please subscribe to This Is, because we would really appreciate it, otherwise we won't be able to buy anymore dumb things on Wish, that sounds like a cry for help, but it's not, Matt, why is that not a cry for help? - Cause we have more Wish things already! - You mean you already bought them, and we're about to do a video on them very soon, and that's why they should subscribe? - Roughly five months ago. - Cool. - Yeah.

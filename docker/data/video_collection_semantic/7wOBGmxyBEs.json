    "transcript": "well it's time I'm switching back to Intel now don't get me wrong our entire rising experience we've done so much content around it has been incredible and the amount of time savings we received using the eight core sixteen thread 1700X monster has been immense in comparison to what I was using in the past with Intel but I think it's time to switch back to Intel see how those guys is doing in terms of stability in particular for Adobe Premiere and that entire suite of applications because the latest Adobe suite updates don't work for my machine everything is crashing I have to revert the drivers I have to revert the programs and it just seems like there's this misalignment between Adobe and AMD Ryzen and that does not work well with me and just to make sure I'm not making a huge mistake by switching to an 8600K which is only a 6 core 6 thread part I've run some gaming benchmarks alongside with the rendering performance just to see if I'll be gaining anything in performance with the Intel side of things I'm not really looking for performance improvements because right now rendering is pretty good anyway but I'm mainly looking for improvements in stability so let's do the system swap right after this what is that the view 31 you should put a ring on it yes time to make it hard to be official there will take ring high static pressure fans because your case deserves a ring full details in the description below so this switch back to Intel is not permanent I just want to see if those issues also exist on an Intel platform or I'm just being super unlucky with my machine here so inside I have a 1700X at 3.8 gigahertz I cannot push that any further i have a gtx 1080 and then vme SSD nothing is eber is also having issues with his adobe applications so it seems like it's a platform specific issue and not necessarily component issue this also gives me the perfect opportunity to create my black and white system inside the PC o 11 dynamic using the white and 7 motherboard from NZXT with the kraken X 72 and I'll put in some RGB fans on here so that it's like you know going back to the illumination days from something that was air cooled or something that has an all-in-one and RGB should be fun so usually this part of like actually installing the motherboard inside the case is never a concern until now so I've stumbled upon the frustrating hiccup because of this white shroud it's a bit unconventional it requires these long screws for mounting otherwise you can't fit a normal screw in there but the threading on the screw is different from the threading on the motherboard standoffs here so I had to take out some Malamud stand offs from the h200 encase put them inside the Lindley case so it can actually mount this motherboard and you would think that this would be standardized across all cases in terms of what type of thread the screw and the motherwort standoffs use but as you can see here apparently that is not the case man so it's been a frustrating couple of hours as you can see by the state of this office so I finally was able to boot into Windows with this system but not without its challenges because of this motherboard so the reason why I have all these NVIDIA GPUs out on the table here is because I'm only able to boot with an AMD card into the windows because for some reason the motherboard would not detect the signal from an Nvidia card but the text set from an AMD just fine which is also why I have this riser cable because I was actually able to bypass some sort of bias thing with this riser cable using an Nvidia card to actually get into Windows but right now we're back to an AMD card because I have to access the BIOS in order to overclock some memory and CPU which I cannot do with an nvidia card so yeah this has been fun alright so let me get this clear for you I use an AMD card to get into the bias of the n7 motherboard to overclock the memory to XMP profile and the CPU to four point nine gigahertz I still cannot go beyond four point nine because then it will not boot whereas with this ITX motherboard from Asus five gigahertz in five minutes no problems whatsoever so now we're back on my machine and video card inserted right now so I can resume my tests but still wow I was not expecting this experience to be all over the place and quite frustrating - it is kind of ironic - if you think about it of me wanting to switch to Intel because of extra stability yet we have all this instability instead damn you and seven yeah I don't think it's stable Wow believe it or not after some 20 hours of troubleshooting with NZXT trying multiple graphics card multiple riser cables multiple configurations and the BIOS I finally figured out what was causing the issue and it was the monitor so this 4k freezing display would not do it with an Nvidia graphics card but once I populate this g-sync panel I'm here from Acer everything boots just fine no issues I can get into the BIOS without needing to plug in aim the GPU first so that is awesome however I still cannot achieve my 5 gigahertz overclock the system is not stable with this motherboard I am doing some benchmarks right now to see what performance we get at 4.8 but the asus prime z 370 a saves the day so this is also a black-and-white color theme so that fits perfectly and this white actually matches the case much better instead of this eggshell white that we see on the n7 this one we have more aluminum that matches the graphics card so color scheme here works out perfectly well and i've had nothing but fantastic results with overclocking on asus boards so i'm actually quite excited to populate the chip and here do the quick system swap so I can finally resume my work aka edit this video it's actually a good thing I did not do cable management easy-peasy and now I have to repopulate all the original standoffs inside this case which is a bit inconvenient I wish that these things were standardized across all cases across all motherboards I am very much out of thermal paste catch I am pretty confident and hopeful that this will work come on they sous work with me here I'm such a noob forgot the front eh oh hello forgot to switch on the power supply beautiful and all right moment of truth but the question is will shit boot with an LG display something that I was not able to achieve on the n7 motherboard strangely Oh BAM that is how you do it a soos or NZXT and so the first order of business is making sure that the system looks beautiful with the illumination so both the GPU the kraken and the motherboard area all have this purple illumination that looks beautiful inside the white enclosure I mean I haven't even done any cable measures so right now all my SSDs are just hanging out over here you know this is this whole thing is just a mess but five gigahertz is achieved in five minutes I just had to tinker with some memory stuff but yeah everything going well with this asus board whoo so after all that trouble was the switch actually worth it so for 1080p gaming games like overwatch Assassin's Creed origins and which are three for example don't really see a significant boost in performance for averages and minimums however Far Cry 5 and bf1 definitely see that substantial increase in frame rates with the Intel chip and bumping up the resolution to 1440p the difference is not as significant as 1080p results obviously because the GPU is more important in this resolution so the frame rates are on both chips are pretty acceptable and I game at 1440p anyway so the slight boost in frame rates is not that significant but it's nice but then what's premieres performance like because that's why I'm making this whole switch in the first place so back a few months ago when I tested the 86 hundred K versus the 1700 X the Intel chip was rendering the videos faster than Ryzen but since then it seems like Adobe have upgraded their engine to utilize better cores and threads on horizon systems because rendering 4k videos on my 1700X is faster 8600k at 5 gigahertz now this difference of 1% is not significant at 4k however if your output into 1080p the difference skyrockets to 24% of the 5 gigahertz 8600k vs. 3.8 of the 1700X and it seems like those extra cores and threads on the Ryzen system really are utilized when you output to 1080p with Adobe so just keep that in mind if you're potentially thinking of getting arisin for content creation it's still a fantastic value and performance the one thing we're into winds is warp stabiliser something that they use quite often so you're about 20% faster and stabilizing clips versus rising but numbers aside editing on an Intel machine inside premiere is like night and day vs. risin so absolutely no dropped frames when playing back original 4k footage with adjustment layers and color presets applied something that I've never been able to do on the rising machine because we start to drop frames as soon as the playback starts to happen so you rely on using proxies to to like edit stuff and now I can just preview original 4k pixel to pixel footage and not see a dropped frame when so many layers are stacked on top of each other that is exactly what I was looking for when I initially wanted to make the switch back to Intel and it really makes me sad to date tries it because I feel like this platform has a lot of potential especially with the Zen plus that just launched so you're seeing about 10 to 20% extra rendering performance on like the new 2,000 chips so make sure to check out our review over here but you know until we get that you know that balance of stability and performance with highly used applications like Adobe Suites you know people will gravitate towards Intel because of that and by the way if you have not yet subscribed to the new channel boot sequence consider doing so let's see what's on the news hey what's up guys I'm your host snows and today in the news we've got YouTube cracking down on MC NS Amazon trying to get into your car and some new rumors on the nvidia gtx 1180 click down below to learn more alright guys so I hope you enjoyed this little adventure coming along with me and just seeing the whole process of how things have evolved throughout this entire idea and I'm happy that everything is stable it looks beautiful I love the purple I love the case but I do miss that air cooler because going with them eh oh that is definitely louder alright guys I'm Dimitri make sure to subscribe and check out this other relevant content most likely Ryzen and we'll see you in next video",

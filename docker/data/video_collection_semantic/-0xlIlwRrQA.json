    "transcript": "- Are we allowed to put this on YouTube? (Austin croaking) Hello and welcome to \"This Is.\" Let's see some Amazon reviews! \"I whip out this thing like it's cash money and flip it around like a $2 bill you've never seen before. I'm throwing everything in there, towels, shirts, pants, my grandmother's bathrobe, my grandfather's ashes.\" - \"I can sell this thing to a man without a torso. God bless.\" Thank you boomers for making Amazon reviews a glorious opportunity for us all. - So Kinsey has picked up a bunch of Amazon reviews and we have to try and guess what they are based on just the review alone. We did this a couple episodes ago. We did not do great. I won that competition, of course I did, because Austin loses everything. I'm gonna say that this is a- - You're making a guess already! - Yeah. - Okay. - I'm gonna say that this is a steamer. And then this psychopath puts his grandfather's ashes in there. - You know, I'm gonna say, just to be contrary, this is some kind of bag. Final answer. - Alright, so I'm gonna modify mine slightly. - Oh, too late! - [Kinsey] Is a laundry folding board. (Matt groaning) - I don't think either of us get points on this one. - But where are the ashes from? - What? - Okay, I think- - The ashes is just this guy being insane. - The people who leave these reviews are absolute psychopaths. I think I get the most amount of points. - You get one point. - I get one point because I at least was talking about laundry. - I think my bag of some sort for clothes is also worthy of one point. - You never said \"clothes,\" you just said \"bag.\" - Yeah, bag to put, obviously, the clothes. - I at least said \"clothes,\" Matt gets three points. Moving on! - No, no, no, no, no! Kinsey's the point master! Kinsey, where do you come down on this one? - Yeah, but I'm Kinsey's boss. - I'm your boss! - So? - Let's go to the next item. - All right. - [Austin] \"The long con. Big tree time, ha ha ha. It's about to be big tree time for my neighbor Shaun.\" (Austin laughing) 125 people found this helpful! Shaun is about to get big tree'd. (Austin croaking) - Are we allowed to put this on YouTube? - Have you experienced big tree time? - You're about to get big tree'd. - What's wrong with neighbor Shaun? - Oh no. - What's wrong with neighbor Shaun? He doesn't deserve to be big tree'd! - I'm absolutely baffled by this one. I have no idea. (Austin laughing) Fertilizer. - (laughs) What? - No, no. - What? - A fake plant. That's all I got. - I think this is a costume of some variety. Either it's Groot or it's like camouflage, something like that. - I'll lock in my wrong answer of some sort of ridiculous fake plant, but I do think you're right. - [Kinsey] Tree seeds! - Tree seeds? I was close- Oh, my... - Wait, wait, wait, is this guy really- - Is he gonna plant a California Giant Redwood in Shaun's Backyard? - Shaun is gonna regret this decision in two to 400 years! - I think I could have gotten points if I stuck with manure or fertilizer. - Yeah. - But I- - You can get one point. (bell ringing) - I'm up 10 points today! Moving on to the next one! \"How long can I wear the product? For the wearing of blank, it would depend how much body perspiration you have. If you are normally a dry kind of person, the blank could last several days. If you're a waterfall kind of person, I would say a few minutes before the blank broke down and stuck to your body.\" - I don't ever wanna be described as a normally dry kind of person. - But I also don't wanna be described as a waterfall kind of person. I feel like we're on a spectrum here. You got the Mojave over here, and you got Niagara falls over here. - Stop, stop, stop, no! So here's the thing, right? It's gonna be something lame, it's be like, it's some kind of patch that you put onto your body, that's my final answer. - All right, these are temporary tattoos. And I know this because for Halloween, I went as Post Malone and I could not get the damn tattoos off my body for, like, a week. I would not call myself a dry nor waterfall type of person. But those were- - Because no one should! - [Kinsey] It's football cards. - I'm offended by this. - Kinsey played incredibly dirty on that one. - You know like what they say, don't go chasing waterfalls. But what we should chase is the next Amazon review. - [Austin] \"Please come back, Becky.\" Oh boy, this is a great start. Blank is true in every way, unlike my ex-wife. Although it does a superb job of whisking away the droplets of sweat that fall from head, it does little for the tears that fall from my face. If you're worried about the plushness of this product, fear not, it is perfect to lay down on the back seat of your 2003 GMC Yukon, which I am currently living out of.\" What the (beep). - Kinsey, I specifically asked you not to use my review! (Austin laughing) - How are we ever gonna get this? This guy has problems! It has nothing to do with the Amazon review! - I think this is a callback to our first episode. - Ooh, okay. - And I think this is the same product that we were ripping tanks with! - [Austin] \"I hit an absolute tank in slow pitch softball with the boys wearing these.\" Do you ever rip tanks? Is that a thing we can do? (Kinsey laughing) - Kinsey, did you call back to an earlier episode? - Maybe. - Oh! Full points for Matt on that one. - Let's see it, let's see it! - [Kinsey] Yoga mat. - [Matt] No! What? I was so confident. (buzzer ringing) - I didn't even take a guess on that one 'cause I was so convinced that you were right. - Kinsey, you done me dirty. - [Kinsey] I'm giving you two points because that was a really good answer. - Also, I think it's my turn to read this one. No, no, no, you read the last one. - It's my turn. \"My wife purchased this for Christmas thinking it was an Alexa. Even when she wrapped it, she didn't notice it was a blank. What bothers me most is I've shown her the exact model of blank I wanted Santa Claus to bring me and it didn't look anything like this. Anyways, we decided to give this a try. This thing has saved our marriage!\" Please contact Becky after this. (Austin laughing) - I'm not gonna go where obviously everyone's head's at right now. This is some shenanigans going on. I'm gonna think in a completely different direction. What's something that looks like an Alexa that is innocuous and also saves marriages? - I mean, like, a Bluetooth speaker would be, like, the obvious one. - Saves most marriages, Bluetooth speakers. - I know it's not a Bluetooth speaker. - It has to look like an Alexa. - Here's the thing, I think Alexa's being used in the context right here the same way, like, oh, every boomer calls any video game \"a Nintendo.\" - I think it's a clock. I'm gonna just say it's a clock or time keeping device of some type. That's my answer. - I have no idea. - One of the censored words is \"buns.\" - You can't tell him that after I locked my answer in! (Kinsey laughing) - I'm gonna think what saved our marriage, which was the toaster, the $500 toaster. That's what I'm gonna say. - [Kinsey] You're absolutely correct. (bell ringing) (chair snapping) - I broke the chair. (Matt and Kinsey laughing) - I call shenanigans 'cause not only is this my toaster, Matt got the hint after I locked my answer in! - I still get the question! (Matt giggling) - Can I just ask who orders this? - You're losing points for that weird laugh. - Exactly, excellent! (buzzer ringing) - I definitely broke this chair, by the way. - Yeah, you jumped up and down on it like an absolute maniac. Your wife, sir, may need to get her eyes checked if you think that this is an Alexa and not a toaster. - In my headcanon, Becky left her first husband for this new one. - Who actually got her a toaster. - Becky's a serial divorcer. This toaster has stopped Becky in her track of just divorcing everyone. - The toaster is what's good and right in this world. - Let's move on to the next item. - [Austin] \"Best prank ever!\" - Why does Austen get all the pranks? - I'm a fun guy. \"Placed it in the vent in my boss's office. After a couple days, he had a blank come in to check for the blank. A week later, he was going absolutely nuts. I started to feel bad, but then he came out and started to be a dick to a coworker, so I figured he gets another week of blank. They finally started to remove all the drop ceiling tiles to figure out what was blank. He recently switched to a different office. Guess what moved with him? That's right! His new office now has a new blank.\" - There's no way this isn't just some sort of stink bomb. Can you just buy, like, a whole (beep) mackerel? Just a fish from Amazon. - I am gonna say this is a little noise generator that's making annoying sounds. - The mouse jiggler. - No, this a sound in the vent. It's a sound thing. - Nope, yep, you're right, you're right. - [Austin] Oh wow, what a horrible device! - [Kinsey] It won't stop beeping for three years. - That's messed up! (buzzer ringing) - Who puts that in an Amazon review? - This is a serial killer device. - This is terrible, but I think I get points on this one. - All right, can we get a recap of the score? 'Cause he did get full points. I'll fully admit he got full points. - I say it's probably, like, five-V-five right now. - Five-V-five! - That sounds all right. - I got 27 points before! - You laughed funny and she removed them. And then you broke your chair and you got negative points. - I am sinking, by the way. (Austin laughing) Just FYI. This chair is, like, legitimately broken. \"Is it harvested from free range game-\" - Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. - The gamers did not rise up for this one. \"There is no such thing as a free range gamer, unless you're a mobile breed. But no one speaks of lesser creatures. This was harvested from the crusted keyboards of many a sweaty nerd, or the silt-covered crevices of an Xbox controller.\" - Oh, man. I don't like anything that I just saw. So obviously it's a gamer product. It's a non-slip thing for a controller or a keyboard. - You think it's on the controller. - Controller, mouse keyboard, it's something to keep your hands from slipping. - [Matt] Is this like those finger condoms? - [Austin] Oh no. - I'm going with finger condom. - Okay. - [Kinsey] Gamer Goo. - [Austin] Oh, that's- - [Kinsey] Austin was pretty close! - Can we talk about how upsetting this name is? - At least it smells like cherry blossom. - Probably the best smelling thing that a gamer... I don't wanna talk about Gamer Goo anymore. - No, don't finish that sentence, please. - [Matt] \"I can say unequivocally that the experience was wonderful. I showed up at work and my boss immediately handed me bottle of heated milk.\" (Austin laughing) First of all, we're doing work way, way wrong at this point. \"At lunchtime, I crawled down the hallway until Roger from IT gave me a toy race car I could zoom up and down the conference room. All day, I heard people say, 'Anyone know where the blank went? I don't don't see him anywhere.' Little did they know that it wasn't an actual baby in the office, but it was me.\" (Austin laughing) I don't feel good. \"When I came to work the next day, everyone was talking about the giant baby that showed up to the office the day before. I didn't tell them what happened. This is now our little secret.\" - It's gotta be a baby costume, right? Come on! - I'm gonna get more specific with it. - Okay, go for it. - I'm gonna say it's that, like, super hyper-realistic baby mask. I'm so upset by this. - I don't like... Okay, all right. (Austin screaming) (Matt laughing) - Debbie, why would you swaddle this? - I want that photo to go away. What a great review, though. I want more reviews from Amazon written from the perspective of babies. - This is your thumbnail, by the way. - [Austin] \"A very helpful way to find your balls. Sometimes it's very frustrating to find my balls.\" - I know. - Matt, can you speak to this personally from experience? - I don't wanna talk about giant babies and then finding your balls. - Babies play with balls all the time, what are you talking about? All kinds of balls. You just need to experience more balls in your life. (baby crying) - Balls. - This is an impossible question, but I will say this is clearly not from Amazon. I detect skullduggery, is what I detect. - This is from Sharper Image. (Austin humming thoughtfully) - Oh, this is golf, golf, golf! - I'm gonna take a wild swing. I'm going for birdie. I'm gonna say these are glow-in-the-dark golf balls. - Ooh! That's a very good answer. I would say I agree. I'm gonna go with something to be a little different. I'm gonna say it's a golf ball that, like, makes noise or something. But I think you're right. - I do think that would be more on par with... - Hey, that's... - With Sharper Image. All right! Let's see, trying to find your balls on the links. - [Kinsey] So you guys are both close, but not quite. - [Matt And Austin] Oh! - [Matt] Okay, okay! - [Austin] All right! Golf ball-finding glasses. They're just blue glasses that tint out the green of grass and whatnot. - It's one of those things, again, we did this with Sharper Image, you can go check out that video right here, however, this is one of those things that, like, it seems like a decent idea from Sharper Image, but it is, again, about $59.97 too expensive for what it is. You threw us for a sand trap on that one. - I don't appreciate getting caught in the rough. - This was a water hazard. All right, after tallying up the score, I think I am the winner here. - I think the viewers are the winner for this highly entertaining piece of content! make sure to subscribe to \"This Is\" for Matt to cheat and Kinsey to throw lots of skullduggery our way. And if you enjoyed, then you know what to do. Ringling the dingling button, check out some of our other videos, and until next time, we're gonna go argue about who actually won this complete nonsense game. (mellow hip hop music)",

    "transcript": "I've been saying repeatedly on your show and to my students is that I believe that hacking radio signals is really the next level I'm so glad the Flipper Zero came out because the Flipper Zero has made everybody aware of all the possibilities of radio hacking we've been ignoring for all these years. If you're just sitting there throwing up firewall rules and and using you know an IDs or whatever to try to prevent attacks if you don't really understand what the hacker is doing it's you're going to be working blind so I strongly recommend that if you want to be a cyber security pro not necessarily a hacker that you study hacking. I personally wouldn't connect to a free Wi-Fi without the use of a VPN because you never know if it's a legitimate Wi-Fi access point or a rogue Wi-Fi access point. Now based on the recommendations of hackers, cyber Security Experts that I've spoken to and book books such as these the VPN provider that I've been using for a long time is Proton VPN. One of the concerns people have however is how fast is the connection to the VPN. In this example I've connected to Proton VPN in the UK so a local connection let's see how fast this is going to be. So I'll go to fast.com now in no way is this scientific and the speeds that you get may be very different but at the time of this recording those are the speeds I'm getting when I tested this earlier I was getting 610 megabits per second down. So if I was using public Wi-Fi and I would be very careful doing that I would always use a VPN. If I'm using a connection in a hotel I would use a VPN this is an example of the speeds that I've been getting using a local connection. Speeds of course will vary and you may get very different speeds to me as in all things in life you need to weigh up the pros and cons of using the internet with or without a VPN. Personally if I was using a public Wi-Fi connection or a connection in a hotel I would always want to use a VPN and Proton VPN is the VPN that I've been using once again for a long time. Big shout out to Proton for sponsoring this video hey everyone it's David Bombal back with the amazing Occupy The Web. Occupy The Web welcome. Thank you David it's always great to be on the best IT and cyber security channel on YouTube. As always I really appreciate you saying that and you're a big reason for that now if you who the viewers who are watching haven't seen our previous videos I've linked them below Occupy The Web and I have done a whole bunch of videos if you don't know who he is you should by now but um in case you don't he's the author of this book Linux Basics for Hackers, fantastic book. Occupy The Web and I have also created a series of videos covering a bunch of topics in this book so I've link that below as well. Occupy The Web has also written this book Getting Started Becoming a Master Hacker and Network Basics for Hackers is one of my favorite books because I love networking. Occupy The Web we were talking offline that you covered some of it in this book but we're going to do an updated version for 2024. A comment I often see on YouTube is people say I've installed Kali Linux or something now what you know what tools should I look at using and I'm hoping that you're going to show us your top 10 hacking tools. I'd love to show you my top 10 hacking tools. I do cover I do cover it in the book Getting Started coming Master Hacker but I'm going to do a little bit of an update on that list and and kind of show you what's what's happening now, what tools I think are most important um um and show you the latest versions of them you if you're starting out as you know cyber security pro or hacker you know I I think I kind of use those terms interchangeably because I really think as a cyber security pro you should know how to hack because you really can't defend what you can't do. I mean if you don't understand hacking you're not going to be a good defender you know you're you're if you're just sitting there throwing up firewalls rules and and using you know an ideas or whatever to try to prevent attacks if you don't really understand what the hackers do and it's you're going to be working blind so I strongly recommend that if you want to be a cyber security pro not necessarily a hacker that you study hacking that's going to make you better at becoming a cyber security defender and and forever that's worth let's let's get started then okay. One of the first tools that I think everybody should know no matter what field you're in in IT, cyber security, hacking what have you is Wireshark right. Wireshark is It's a wonderful tool and I know you've had a number of people on your channel talking about Wireshark but let's just talk about it briefly here and just show you. Now one of the things that you may not be accustomed to if you're coming from a different environment than Linux is that in Linux you can often times most times not all the times but most of the time simply type the name of the tool you want to use in the command shell and it'll open it up of course you also have the option of using a menu system here right and you can go ahead and search around for your Wireshark or whatever you can type in Wireshark here and find the link to it and there it is right there you can see it okay but we're going to use it from the command line and we're just going to go let go sudo wireshark sudo because we need root privileges to do certain things in Wireshark so let's go ahead and put our password in for those of you who aren't familiarsudo gives us root privileges in Linux and so the first thing you're got to come up with and when you open up the Wireshark says Wireshark network analyzer. Those of you who might be taking some of the certification exams out there SEC plus what however you um you might run across the term protocol analyzer all right so that often is used to describe Wireshark. As a protocol analyzer or Network analyzer you can see that as I open it up it's showing me the possible interfaces and you can see the activity and there's one that says any interface and the other one says eth0 right. eth0 is ethernet zero our first ethernet adapter remember that in computers we always start counting at zero not at one so every the first item in the list is always zero not one. That takes some getting used to if you're not uh you haven't been part of this world let's go ahead and click there and it'll begin to show me the packets that are coming across that interface. I don't see any packets coming across the interface I can always create some by say just going to opening up a browser there we go you can start to see the packets coming across there now I took a little delay there this is this is Wireshark and what it's doing is it's sniffing the packets going across in my case here at eth0 the ethernet adapter the first ethernet adapter you might have more than one ethernet adapter in which case they would be called ethernet1 second one would be called ethernet1 the third one would be called ethernet2 okay and these this is the live feed of packets that it's sniffing okay and it shows over here the number of the packet these are just simply numbered starting with one right and we're already up to about 10 99th 9900 packets the time since the initiation since you've opened up Wireshark source IP address, the destination IP address, the protocol that it's using, the links of the packet and then some some simple description of the packet including you can see here the sequence numbers, you can see whether there not there's a flag set on it and of course you know that when we have a three-way handshake that the first packet has a syn flag and then a syn ack and then an ack and all the packets after that and that's what's going on over here we can go ahead and pick any one of these packets I just clicked on one and then what that allows me to do then is to go ahead and analyze that packet I can I can dig deep into that packet and see everything that's going on inside of it and this is where I can go ahead and you see here's a TCP I expanded it by clicking on the little button there and it'll show me all the key information and this is not a Wireshark class but I just wanted to kind of demonstrate simply what it can do and then you see there's the Ack numbers you know if you know a little bit of TCP there's the relative sequence number. Then over here we have the the payload in hexadecimal that's one of those skills that you need to know folks right you need to know a little bit of heximal and then over here we have an an ASCII all right. So if I were to open up my browser and go to my favorite website all right which of course is hacker eyes right I will see it come across the screen it comes first of all it comes to the browser and then we'll see it come over here so here we done what we've done is we've searched for the content of the payload all right looking for the word hackers and you can see that it's pulled up here you can see right here hackers rise and over here it's an hex all right so we're just looking for that one key word that's all we're looking for so it's that's real basic one of the things that you want to do if you're using Wireshark is that you want to be able to know how to analyze and you know if you're new to networking and cyber security you may not know what the look for and how to create filters these are called filters up here we're just trying to take out certain path pets and and just look at them and analyze them you see here is analyze okay and it says display filter expression right here what this does is opens up a window and here you can see the thousands of feels that you can search for all right so you know these literally there's thousands of fields that you can search for in uh Wireshark and it just go quickly to just like TCP which is you most of what we're doing uh let's go here the TCB transmission control protocol right there and then you can see all of the fields with an TCP that I can search for so for instance TCP flags are equal to s that would be the opening of a TCP connection it creates a filter for you I click on it I can go over here and say the relation it defaults to equal equal which means that it's set okay to sin the where is one okay here's the value one and it says here set I go ahead and click on that it creates a filter and then will filter for all of the packets that have Sy flag set on it and let's go ahead and put that and now I've got all of the Sy flag packets right so we can go we can dig really deep into every packet to determine what's going on in those packets and this is what essential I was essential tool for anybody who's working within the field of cyber security networking what have so that's tool number one I'm going to ask you a question that I think a lot of people will be asking um Occupy The Web so I'm going to ask hopefully a lot of like um beginner questions or questions that the audience might have and the first thing I'm going to say is like Occupy The Web this is not hacking this is protocol analysis why do I need to learn this well you know some if you're looking about it's not hacking really the only part that you could really use Wireshark for for hacking is to sometimes to analyze well first of all if passwords are being passed unencrypted okay in plain text you you can see them in Wireshark right but if you're trying to understand say ah Haack so somebody's already hacked you compromised your system and you're trying to understand what they did this is the first step that you would go if you capture the packets and then you begin to analyze what they did so I would agree that it's not hacking but it's part of the analysis um tool set that you use both as a network engineer or cyber security so if I'm if I'm sitting here on the defensive side and I'm being compromised the first tool I'm going to open is probably going to be wiar because I want to understand what that hacker just did to my system and I can see all of that in wire shot is it also true to say that if the problem a lot of we said it a lot with in the cyber security space that a lot of people who are new just want to jump straight ahead and like they want to run before they can even crawl and this helps you make sure that you learn what's actually happening on the wire so you actually understand the protocols that you perhaps trying to hack I I would agree 100% I mean if you if you don't really understand TCPIP you know it's going to be hard if you to be a successful hacker you know you might be able to you know use some of the simple tools and you know maybe compromise somebody's Wi-Fi what have you but if you really want to advance and become really Adept in this field you got to understand TCPIP and Wireshark's going to help you because it's showing you all the information about what's happening on your wire or somebody else's wire and that way you're going to better learn how these protocols work and how they are equipped now one of the things that it's important to note is that most of what goes on in tcpip or the other protocols yes is all defined by what are called rfc's requests for comments and these requests for comments or rfc's Define how the protocols should talk to each other right how they can communicate it's like agreeing that you you know in this case here we're agreeing that our protocol is has been defined by English right and if we're both not speaking English we're going to have a hard time communicating that's what that's what a protocol does or an RFC does to a protocol it says okay we're all going to agree to speak the same language and here's the rules of the language and those are defined by RFC so you can begin to understand how these Protocols are are defined by analyzing the protocols in wihar it's also important to note that as a hacker you can defy the protocols you can defy the rfc's you don't have to follow the rfc's the rfc's are designed for people who want to successfully communicate if if you don't if you don't if you're not caring if you don't care about successfully communicating you can create packets that are not compliant with these rules and sometimes that can be really helpful to you because by creating packets that are not complying with these rules sometimes you can get information or get the system to do things that it wasn't intended to do now a really good tool for doing packets that don't meet the uh rfcs is something like hping3 uh hping 3 will allow you to create packets of just about any type and right now hping 3 has become one of the the hacker most important DS tools right now we're seeing a lot of DSes coming from hping because it allows us to create a packet that defies all of the protocols and the rules of those protocols which are often they referred to as rfc's so I would say that the first thing you need to do is you need to understand networking protocols and Wireshark the tool to do that all right I agree okay good all right I'm gonna close down my Wireshark and uh I'm gonna all right so when I'm closing down Wireshark I could stop and quit without saving or I can stop and save this would be saving all the packets that I can use for later analysis I don't have to necessarily do my analysis in real time I can just open up Wireshark and and it'll automatically save the packets for me and then I can analyze them at at my leisure you know whether that be tomorrow or next week right so I'm going to go ahead and I'm GNA stop without saving okay I'm going to open up a a Target system for us here and uh I'm going to do end map next also I'm glad you mentioned why shock and it's nice to hear how you pitching it not just for hacking right but you for cyber Security Professionals as well right right we we we train both hackers and cyber SEC but but we emphasize that what we call a cyber Warrior is somebody who's who's conversent in both offense and defense because I really firmly believe that you really can't defend the system and I work with a lot of cyber security Pros some of them with 10 and 20 years of experience and they really don't know how their systems are being hacked they're just following a cookbook of rules that you know they they've been given by you know the uh the firewall manufacturer what have you and they totally are dependent upon you know the new rule sets coming from The Wire the uh firewall manufacturer or the IDS manufacturer really don't understand what's going on so we try to train them in how hackers actually work and then I think they're better at defending their Network so let's go ahead and clear okay so I've gone ahead and and uh I've opened up a Target system and my target system here is going to be Dragon OS uh dragon OS is an SDR is a Debian based labunu actually it's a luntu based operating system that is tuned for doing radio hacking it's got a whole lot of tools in it I use it it's great tool it's a great operating system and so we're going to be using it as our Target so let's just do a quick if of config you can see that it uses different notation okay for the interfaces than Debian does hopefully this doesn't throw people off let me expand the screen which show the larger zo men whereas Debian calls the first inter ethernet interface eth0 the launu and those of you who are using launu will notice that it's using a different notation this case is ens 33 here's my IP address and then I'm going to go ahead and try scanning that system so our next tool that is an essential tool for anybody in cyber security or hacking is nmap nmap's been around forever 25 years now I think yeah 25 years about 1998 or 97s when it first came out and it's still great it's still a great tool it's an essential tool and so one of the things we we want to do is just type end map and then just do n-h to see all of the options there's a lot of options I'm going to expand this and so if we can see all of the help screen so I just opened up for the help screen to show you there just lots and lots of options and sometimes this can be overwhelming to the newcomer but in reality end map is pretty simple all right so let's see if we can't and just boil it down to real simple terms of what how to work with nmap it's in lots of options if you want to go ahead and scan now what this tool does in its most basic form is it is going to tell you first is the target system online that's the first thing so first thing it does is it sends an icmp a ping to the Target and waits to see whether or not that ping came back if it comes back it will then begin to scan the top one ,000 not the first 1,000 but the top 1,000 ports right why ports ports represent a service it's where a service connects to the Internet so for instance we know HTTP is on Port 80 usually right by default it's on Port 80 so if we see Port 80 open on a system we know that HTTP is running on that system why is that important because there if we want to attack HTTP first thing we got to know is whether or not it's actually running then not every system has Port 0 open at it if we're trying to attack for instance SMB as Port 445 we would check to see whether or not that system has has Port 445 open at it if it is then we can begin to explore the possibilities of attacking it so the first thing you want to know is what ports are open on that system and this is how we do it real simple n map okay then dash s that's scan now the next step is the type of scan and there's many types of scan you can do with nmap but really the most basic and probably the most important is a t- scan a t- scan is simply a TCP scan which means that it creates a three-way handshake with the target system we know that to create any type of TMP connection to a Target whether it be your H your web server website what have you it has to First create a three-way handshake that's the most reliable type of scan so we can do that with a t and then we just got to give it the IP address that's all we have to do so all that all these other options that are out there right we can ignore them for right now and simply go 192 168 107 uh I forgot the IP address let's go back 107 137 okay 136 so what we're going to do is we're going to go in and run a scan and see what ports are open on that system let's do that and hit enter and if it's up okay if it's there's a couple things I want to kind of mention if it's down it'll come back and tell us that it's not online but also remember that a lot of uh Network Engineers will drop icmp they will not allow IC m p to return so if you ping a machine rather than allowing icmp to Echo reply so icmp is defined by Echo request okay that's us asking for an answer and then Echo reply right which is the system coming back and answering us a good network engineer who's security conscious often times will simply not allow the system to reply because it's a way of hiding it's a way of hiding the the host right that make it easy for the hacker in that case if that's the case inmap will just come back and say oh it doesn't exist because it won't start scanning until he it knows the system is actually on line and I'll show you how to get past that in just a sec so nmap St right TCP scan and then hit enter I think you need to put your 136 on the end I wasn't sure if you actually had toped this oh I'm sorry I got talking and I forgot to B the last stock 10 and then we hit enter and we start scanning and it says all right says host is up okay tells us host is up all 1000 scan ports are ignored States okay so what we can do now is let's go back over to our dragon and let's start a Apache server I think there's Apache on the system so we'll go suo Apache two sorry okay so that's that's kind of the old terminology you know it's using the services we can now use system control both of them will work on most linuxes now so I've started the Apache server to check to see whether the Apache server is running that go ts- Au and then grep okay Apache 2 this will show me whether or not the Apache 2 system Apache 2 is right Apache 2 for those you aren't familiar with it is world's most popular web server been around for 30 years now and you can see that it's running over here so I just use the the PS all right which is the pro the processes then the A switchin and then I grep which is a filter or Apache too all right so I know it's running now I can go back to my Kali Linux and I'll scan again and let's go and run it again again and let's see what happens and there it is HTTP is running now that's really helpful we know that Port 80 is open but we don't really know what the service is behind it all right we know that ad is open and by default that means it's HTTP but what type of HT what type of web server is it is it IIs is it Apache 2 is it engine X is it you know all the all of the various types of web servers we can find that out by adding one simple switch okay to nmap V Dash a and then go Das a takes a little bit longer because what it's doing now is it's probing it's sending out probes to every one of the ports that finds open in this case only finds one and it's probing to determine what is actually running behind it and you see it came back with a lot of information it came back and told us that one it's it's unbuntu is the operating system right and then they came back and said it's Apache too and they actually read the the default page and said it worked which is the default page alache if you haven't seen it before you can go to go here open up a browser on the system and if we go Local Host which will take us to our Apache server out our system there it is it works so this is the default page so it's reading that and back uh and telling us that so lot more information we can also if we just wanted to test for a single port we can do- p and then the port number much quicker simpler all right you do that and doesn't have to go through all the other ports there it is okay works great now one of the things that a lot of people are new uh to end map and some of the ethical hacking books and classes will tell you to do is to do a an SS scan because that's a stealthy scan um right you laugh and I laugh it's not really very stealthy because the only difference between the TCP scan and the what they call Sin scan or stealthy scan is it doesn't complete the three-way handshake your IP address is still going to be attached to all those packets all right so it's not like you're really getting past anything at all so I think it really isn't worth doing that but to each their own and so that's one of the you know I what I think is kind of a and it sometimes not give you as good results usually it'll give you about the same results as the t- scan but it really isn't stealthy because the packets still have your IP address big the big the only difference is that the web server will not log a successful connection that's the difference right so that's end map I think you need to know and map you know it's one of those essential tools it's the first step of active reconnaissance the first step of active reconnaissance on any system right now that's kind of begs the question it's like well that's active reconnaissance how about passive reconnaissance and so one of the things that we can do one of the best tools for doing passive reconnaissance is showan let's open up a show here and chodan is a a tool that was developed by what's his first name mly I don't remember his what's his first name his last name is maie he out of San Diego he developed this 10 or 15 years ago this is a tool that scans the world and pulls the banners off every IP address in the world okay that's pretty that's a big task right think about that there are 4.3 billion IP addresses there's 65,000 what 6536 ports per IP address that's a lot of that's a lot of banners to grab and so mly does this with showan and there's a number of other tools that have followed on to showan that do things similar but what's critical about this one is one it's relatively simple to use okay and two at least in the basic in the basics it's free when I for the basic Showdown use it's free so here's Showdown right remember showan is going ahead and pulling the banner on tell you the banner so a banner is essentially a page that it where the web server tells the world who they are what they are right and so that's what showan does now there are other tools that do things differently but this is what showan does it goes around and pulls the banner on all of these IP addresses and ports and then takes that information and puts it into a database and then indexes it for us to search now you can see this is just the explore page okay you have to to get much from it you have to create an account and log in now they actually have paid accounts as well where you get even more uh useful information but you'll see that I can go here and so for instance ethereum miners I can go ahead and click here and these are going to show me all the ethereum miners right there's 8400 of them the cryptocurrency miners right it's amazing when people connect to the internet yes unreal and so so we have all the ethereum miners out there um and you can see that most of them looks like vast number are in Germany right then us and and L if we were to say look for say over here industrial Control Systems which is one of the areas that I specialize in industrial Control Systems industrial control system are really varied okay you can see there are different manufacturers of diff of of industrial control systems and the most widely used but far from the majority is modbus this is Port 512 I can click on this and I can see there's almost a half a million of these systems around the world right and so these are chose me every system in this case it defaults the port 502 now that's not necessarily going to be mod bu but it shows the port 52 and if you really want to make certain that it is mind bus you can look for let's go little further down here get a lot of 52s that aren't that probably are not mod bu but really the important Point here is that you can use Shad to find just about anything you want okay the interesting things as you'll see you can also look for key words such as compot part is the most widely used Honey Pot in industrial Control Systems well I didn't find any interesting they must have taken them all down there was just a few online just recently okay we could go and say oh we all see those that are in China we can just pull all those up in China so it's a really it's a great tool for finding first of all if you're a hacker it's a great tool for finding potentially vulnerable systems that have particular characteristics right if you're somebody in cyber security one of the things that you want to do is to check to see what showan has on your systems right so if you're if you're showing all this information to the world right you want to know that so you know that's one of the things that you want to do if you're working in defense is to make sure that you're not giving away more information than you should and uh in showan and some of these other search engines now just as another example we know that for instance uh Port uh 3306 is used for uh MySQL so we can go and look for those and here we go this shows me 4.6 million that's a lot of systems yep using using MySQL so these are you know if we're looking for and look at this end of life product here too so this is kind of important right because that means it's no longer supported by the manufacturer developer in and updating it and given it security update so this is mean they're going to be particular vulnerable to attack you can see the versions here right it version 5.65 5.74 I like these are old versions of MySQL which makes them them vulnerable yeah and so that's the kind of thing that we can do here you know something that people always mention to me is that well you know nobody ever runs those old operating systems no nobody ever runs those old operating systems com on anymore you know nobody runs Windows XP right okay that's the the most common YouTube comment right exactly and so one of the ways we can do we can actually search by operating system so we go OS right and here I can see some of my previous searches including those that are in Russia uh you use OS Windows 7 let's go look Windows 7 right no nobody runs Windows 7 anymore right oh I don't know why I'm getting these results here let's go let's go back to just visit okay let's see if we can get that there we go all right so my search with SMB uh was returning nothing but I got 42,000 okay systems 6,500 of them are in Russia 5600 in China 34 even in the US you 3,400 now this is not telling me how many systems are running Windows 7 this tells me specifically how many Windows 7 systems are connected to the internet right exactly this this is a 15-year-old operating system and people are still using it to serve right onto the on the internet right you can actually see it pulls up even the the the login screen on these systems so there's far more than this 42,000 because most of those over systems are not connected to the internet these are just the ones connected to the internet of course let's just go back another step and let's go XP right see how many of those are 5,777 so for all of you out there who say nobody nobody runs Windows 7 nobody runs Windows XP I think are different right and one of the things that a lot of people who are new to this field you know one of the things as human beings that we do is that we think the rest of the world does the same things that we do right we extrap we extrapolate from what we're doing to the other 7 billion people on the planet and that's that's dangerous to do right because not everybody or a common comment I'll get was well none of my friends run Windows XP or well yeah that's true I'm sure that's true that none of your friends would run Windows XP but there's at least 5,777 people who were running Windows XP and have it connected to the internet right now these XP systems are really vulnerable to all types of attacks right but people are still using them so be careful in trying to extrapolate your own personal experience your own world to everything else in you that's just a general rule of life right you need to not everybody is doing things the same way you do it and you might ask the question why are these people still running XP and there's a large number of reasons that they still are but they're really putting themselves at risk that by continuing to attach these systems to the internet but this is just a good example of what Shodan can do for us in terms of scanning the globe one caveat one warning about using Shodan is the data is usually a few weeks old right because he can't scan the whole world every day it's just not he's not possible sometimes you'll find a system that appears here and then when you go and actually try say running an end map scan on it you'll find that it's not there anymore or certain ports have been closed so just kind of a is a uh a warning now we want to see say Port just combine we can just combine searches right 3306 and this will show us all the systems that have and there none of them uh let's go 14 33 which is the SQL Server all right and see if we wouldn't expect necessary there we go so this is the port for the SQL Server database on windows so and these are all the systems notice are all end of life OS end of life product so this particular system in France is running a operating system that is end of life OS and end of life product both right you can see these are all very very vulnerable systems okay and most of them are in Korea looks like they're not most of them but the largest number are in Korea so that's probably the first tool that you need to know for Passive Recons I think it's the it's the easiest to learn okay you can basically search by country so if I wanted to go by country as well I could go go country and say yeah and all those that are in uh Spain I think Spain is es is that right I'm yeah and there's all of them so I got 40 I've narrowed it down to 46 systems that are running Windows XP Port 440 so it's both Windows XP and SQL server in Spain I've gotten really specific here right and I've narrowed it down to 46 systems on the planet that meet that criteria so that's tool tool number three let's keep on moving on next tool I want to show you is probably one of the most essential Tools in doing web app hacking which everybody wants to do right everybody wants to hack web applications and there's one tool that nearly everybody uses in web app packing and that's called the burp Suite okay uh and it's going to be you're going to find it up here under web application analysis and there it is the burp seet now built into Kali is the free version there is a paid version to that they charge I think $395 a year for but for most especially if you're just starting out you're not going to want to invest $400 you can do most everything in the free version there's a few things you can but if you're starting out you don't have to have those capabilities so it comes back and says I accept the terms and conditions of course I do of course I accept all of these conditions I and I've read I've read all of them in my 10 seconds there and I agree to all of them then as a as a beginner and using the free version you can't NE you can't save it's a temporary project that's one of the drawbacks so notice it's a Community Edition and so I go next and then I can start burp okay what burp does for us is that it allows us to intercept it's it's a proxy right so it's a proxy that allows us to intercept web traffic and then manipulate it or in whatever way we want we can first of all analyze it okay and then we can manipulate it between our browser and the server so once the traffic leaves our browser we can pick it up we can proxy it that's what it's called it's a it's like kind of like a a man in the middle we're capturing it between the browser and the server and we can analyze it and we can manipulate so with first of all we go ahead and turn on the proxy okay and turn our intercept on notice here we can H look at our history let's go ahead and create some history okay let's open up a browser your briet now has built into it I think the Chrome browser and uh it works best with the Chrome browser of course the Chrome browser has its on issues okay and uh then we go to uh you can use it with other browsers it just takes a little bit more knowledge and so you can start to see the traffic coming up there what you would need to do to use it in the the say Mozilla is well we oh did we do that in a previous class we may have not sure think I think we did yeah I think so yeah I think we did and you see here's the the intercepts on and so what we see here right is the it intercepted okay the packet from my browser to the web serure now this opens up all kinds of possibilities of what we can do right so one of the basics of this the first step oftentimes in web app hacking is you first of all you have to know what's going on in the packets right so this is kind of the analysis stage is that you can go ahead and see each one of the packets so if I go forward right here I can see each one of the packets there's like no there's another one so I've gone through three packets and I can begin to analyze how the browser is communicating with the server and how the server is communicating with the browser once I know that then I have some basic information that I can use to be able to attack the web application there's a number of other tools built into this for instance there's a sequencer and decoder the one that most people are interested when they start out is What's called the Intruder you got to go what you do here with the Intruder is it allows you to go and for instance try cracking remote password so if you got a password on this system so for instance what we can do is we can go right click Send to Intruder and then it'll send this packet we can send this packet repeatedly to the server now this is not a login screen but if it was a login screen I can go ahead and send a password list to the login screen let's see yeah probably there's probably a um without using a it's probably going to get ourselves into trouble with YouTube with this so I probably don't want yeah I don't I don't want to do but I will just say that we can you can use this if you know you don't have to search very far on the web and on hackers eyes and how to use this to go ahead and crack passwords now as a password cracking tool it's not the best in the community Edition because it they actually put a governor on it that it limits the speed that you can go through passwords okay but if you buy the the professional Edition there's no limits it's still not the fastest passer bracket but it does a really good job of identifying the fields okay that you need to be able to log into a website and then try to do remote password cracking but it's one of those tools that if you're going to work in web application security you're GNA you know if you want to test your own website for vulnerabilities if you're trying to hack a website this is the first step you really need to use the burp Suite the burp Suite is like it's one of those essential tools we can't go we don't have time to go into all of the capabilities but it's a really capable tool and it's for free in the community Edition all right let's close be a whole course in itself it is a whole course I mean it's it's a it's a a weekl long course and just doing the burp swe just wanted to right now we're just trying to show you the basics of all the tools that are out there next on our list is going to be Metasploit Metasploit is um a tool that um basically what it does is that it allows you to take all of the off the shelf tools no not all of but many of the off the-shelf tools puts them into a single tool that you can use them so let's go ahead and just do it to open up Metasploit you can either go to exploitation tools right and there's our metlo framework there or you can go msf console what this does is it it opens up an interactive console for Metasploit and inside of Metasploit there's thousands of tools so that's the advantage of it it's not always the latest and greatest in terms of exploits and tools but it saves you a lot of time if you're working on say you know a vulnerable system you can search here to go and find the tool that's going to work against that system once again this is a whole weekl long course of how to use met but I'll just show you a little bit first of all you got to know that the terminology these are exploits these are are essentially these are hacks these are tools that allow you to get inside of the system auxiliary okay those are all of the tools that don't fit into the other categories that are that are not they're not payloads and coders knops Invasion or exploits there's 12220 of those okay these are often these are scanners and password crackers in this area these are post exploitation so after you've cracked over open the system what can you do with it can you turn on the camera can you turn on the the uh a key loger can you you there's a whole lot of things that you can do can you scan the other systems to be able to Pivot to other machines on the network that's all going to be in post exploitation payloads are what you leave behind Okay once I cracked open a system I got to leave behind on the system something that allows me to be able to connect to that system you whenever I want to that's a payload then we have encoders these are things that will change the encoding of the tool knops are called no operations this is often used in developing your own exploits and then we have nine evasion so these are ways that we can change the tool to help it get past antivirus now the way that you need to to find what you're looking for this is kind of the key the first stages of metas is how do I find what I'm looking for I see that there's I see that there's like you know 8,000 modules here right how do I find what I'm looking for well here's how you find it you just use the keyword search and then you tell it what type of module I'm looking for type and say I want an exp of course we always want Expo right exp and and then I then I can then give it a key word or I can go plat form which platform is kind of it's all synonymous with operating system go windows and then say we looking for the Eternal blue exploit Eternal blue for those you who don't know I do an expansive um analysis of Eternal blue and getting started becoming a master hacker because it's one of those exploits that was so widely used and so dangerous that it allowed basically the NS it was developed by the NSA in the US to hack into just about any Windows system right and when it was when it got released onto the internet okay in 2017 so it's six years ago now it was used by criminal hackers to be able to do Peta not Peta wannabe many many Ransom Wares it caused billions of dollars wor damage so we can find that like by simply using that search you can see it came up with three different ones and then here's the original 2017 was Ms 17010 then here's one that has uh this one right here PS exact this basically just allows you to connect if it's already been compromised and here's the one with a double Pulsar remote code execution right so we got three different ones if we were to not put in exploit and just look for etern blue we'll find a few more auxiliary modules well maybe not let's see Windows yeah there is a scanner there's a Eternal romance there is right there yep let's see if we can let's just take out we should be able to find the auxiliary mulus go typ and go auxiliary and this is a a vulnerability scanner for we Turnal new it should be one that there we go and this one will go ahead test to see whether or not this system is vulnerable to Eternal blue and this one here is basically checking to see whether or not there's the remote code execution taking place on the system already so somebody's already compromised so that's how you would go about finding you know you can there's there's all kinds of modules in here let's do do one more search a search right let's go type auxiliary and let go say MySQL my SQL you got 14 14 modules these are auxiliary modules right auxiliary modules aren't necessarily exploits sometimes they are like here you see MySQL authentication bypass hash dump here it's a numeration module these are scanners here's one for testing the login here's getting the version of MySQL lots of different modules in here so Metasploit is one of those white hat hacker tools we have seen it being used as well by black hats uh especially if we're talking about a systems systems like we saw just on sh and where we know that there are vulnerabilities there there's there's widely known vulnerabilities one doesn't have to go and create their own exploit you know we can just go and grab that exploit out of met exploit and go ahead and take control of the system I think the question is going to be Occupy The Web you've got training on all this stuff right so um I mean you you only just touching on it on in this video sorry go on yeah we we're just just touching on each one of them we have classes in each one of these David we're um what we're doing now is we're going to go and just test this eternal blue in metlo the wi the Eternal blue exploit against a vulnerable Windows 7 system just to show just to show what it looks like right that's fantastic yeah so what I done is I've loaded the exploit right here I the use command it goes ahead by default and it puts in a payload okay reverse TCP and then I can do show options this shows me all the options that I need to set to make this exploit work and you can see here required column well if it says required that means you have to put it in right here you can see our host our host stands for remote hosts that's the target here's the Target Port this you can't change because this is an attack against SMB so what we need to set is the our host right and you can see it's already automatically set the lhost that's us the attacker so it looks like the only thing we need to set with this particular export is the our host and we can do that by using the set command set our host and that's it's going to be one 19 this is the uh IP address of the Windows 7 system and it's going to be 100 and N so we've said we want to attack 192 168 1009 we want it to communicate back to us at 192 16800 101 and so all we need to do now is simply say exploit and the system will attempt attt now I say attempt because it doesn't always work you know unlike the you the Tik Tock videos where that always works every time in reality hacks can some even the well-worn well-known hacks don't work all the time that's reality that's you know it's not 30 seconds unless you take over you know the world's most secure server to take over the world's most secure server you might spend years to get inside of it right but here we have an attack that's well known against a vulnerable system and it still doesn't work every time so we'll keep our fingers crossed that it works for us this time and we'll just go exploit and keep our fingers crossed and see what happens you can see it comes back and says it's likely vulnerable and it opened up a interpreter session yay nice so it did work this time easily and simply we could do a Tik Tok video now so now we're inside the Windows system okay so we can to check to see whether that we're actually in we can go notice that we're getting some air communication there here that kind of worries me but let's see CIS info we should tell us yep there we are we're in otws Windows 7 system right or we can do a a dur to check those directories out some Tik Tock system and W cry too this is L that I use for for various these are actually exploits that I developed to work on the system uh and then of course we could also just do if con to see what the IP addresses are so we're inside we are inside and controlling a Windows system now once again this is not it's not always this easy so I don't want to deceive your viewers is that you know it's you can just go ahead and point and click you know at a at a Windows system and immediately take it all even a Windows 7 system because many of them not all of them but most of them are already patched right this I kept this Windows 7 system unpatched for years and years and years just with this purpose but this is how Metasploit works you know you need to justb the right exploit right the correct exploit that's going to match the operating system system and the various features characteristics of that system sometimes the characteristics are going to be ports that are open sometimes it's going to be an application that's on that system sometimes in this case it's going to be what version of SMB is on that system in this case smv1 is vulnerable okay if it's running smb3 it's not going to be vulnerable so that's Metasploit I think that's number five on my list so we're g to shut that one down okay okay the next tool that we want to talk about is Snort now snort is not let's reemphasize is not a hacking tool instead it's a defensive tool it is a tool it's what's called an intrusion detection system it's a it's a system that is looking for attacks against your system system and then sends you an alert that it's this looks suspicious this looks like it might be somebody trying to attack your system and one of the things that you and I talked about in an earlier video is that I used it in Linux basics for hackers as an example you can use you can use any file for an example but I wanted to use snort just because it's a widely used cyber security tool is now owned by Cisco and their taor group was originally an independent company that they purchased and that's part of their cyber security group within Cisco and as you know and you've pointed out several times Cisco is really emphasizing cyber security it's a big new initiative on their part they started off as a networking company and they were very successful at that they being the biggest in the world and now they're really pushing cyber security which they should right and part of that is they purchased well just recently purchased Splunk right and then they purchased snort like in 2014 so snort is was the world's most widely used intrusion detection system and although you may not see its name out there it's built into a lot of ids's including the Cisco products even other manufact because it's open source other manufacturers can use it as their backend software and then put a different front end on a different GUI on the front end of it snort if you want to go ahead and download it out of the one the package managers uh you can get it from the Debian package manager I think Ubuntu also has it built in there it is not in the Kali repository any longer Unfortunately but all you have to do is as you know all you Linux experts out there is you need to go to your sources Etsy apt sources list all right go right I'll open it up okay so we'll just use we'll go mous pad and then we'll go Etsy uh apt sources list all right you open up this file and this is where your system looks for packages all right these are the repositories and so you can see that I've got several of them in here including right here this is the Debian package manager and this is where you will find it all right it is available there as well as other places as well so you just need to add this to your sources list and then do updates pseudo appt update and it'll update your packages so snort is designed to be able to sniff on your wire okay your ethernet or whatever the the interface you have could be used on a wireless interface it could be used on a wired interface but it's designed to sniff the package each packet that comes along to sniff it and determine whether or not that packet is malicious or not if you're a hacker the beauty of understanding snort is that you understand what the security devices are doing that you're trying to get past right you know you want to know what how are they trying to determine whether or not this packet is delicious and what can I do to evade their detection if you're a cyber security pro of course you want to understand this tool to be able to use to alert you and also if you're really Adept at it you can enhance it to do even better than what it's designed to do and we have a class coming up in early 20 we we've done a class on snork we're going doing a new updated version this spring um snork so for those people who are interested in getting to understand this tool better we have that coming up in a very near future in a few months so to run snort all you need to do is go snort and then uh Das vde are the switches we could go ahead and just do a-h to look at the help screen there's lots once again there's a lot of options but we can boil it all down to a very simple command Ry Ro okay is the one who developed it uh I think he's now he's a venture capitalist that we' now he's no longer doing cyber security but he he developed this in 99 I think at while he was working he was working at um GTE in Canada if I remember correctly 98 guess those were here right and then uh he sold it to a company called sourcefire and then Cisco bought Source fire and still a viable product okay it's still out there it's du open source so you can still use it for free you well if you know how to use it and so we can boil down the command to dashb DB okay and then Dash C and then the location of the configuration file and that configuration file is going to be at Etsy snort usually not always but usually snort C and if I typed it all correctly we should get it to run and it'll begin sniffing on my wire it comes back and says parsing rules F snort count permission denied when I see that that really tells me that I I'm not root and I need to be root so that's all I need to do and there it goes so what snort is doing is it's taking every packet and examining it and it look at the header first and then we'll start looking in the payload to see whether or not anything in that packet matches known exports and if it does it'll send you an alert and you can determine where those alerts go to it can go into a database it can go into your log files you can go into your alert files you see every packet coming across here all right and so this is an excellent tool you it's as good as any I can say this I think unequivocally it's as good as any of the commercial tools it just has a little bit of longer learning curve you know the the commercial tools that you'll pay thousands of dollars for are are excellent tools like pal Alto networks and others but snort does just as good a job but it has a little bit longer learning curve and being able to understand how it works and how you can enhance its capabilities and that's part of what we try to teach you our upcoming snort class okay I love that it's part of like five like pfSense has it so you can just use it at home for free right it's fantastic yeah use it use it at home for free right yeah use it at home use it at your small business you know and if your this cyber security is your industry you know it's a good way to train yourself and how ids's work because really they're all working the same way I mean they're all going ahead and examining each packet they sniff off the wire they examine the packet now the rule set and the way they apply rule sets there's some variation there but basically we're looking at the same process and if you're not willing to spend the thousands of dollars to buy one of those commercials and you're just learning this is a good place to learn because it's all free and it's doing the same thing at the commercial products are doing giving you a good background in ids's all right I'm going to stop it from control C okay I'm going to clear my screen the next tool that I want to mention is uh being excellent tool for anybody in cyber security is nessus nessus is the most widely used vulnerability scanner out there now it's it's been used for many years it's owned by a company now called tenable it's started as an open source project you can still get nessus for free I believe let me see if I can show you where you can get it at they have a a home version but still free or trial version I'm going to put it up on the the screen here and uh it's also nessus is included in my getting started becom a master hacking class Master hacker book okay this is nessus by tenable started off as a open source project you can see up here there's a try and a buy and sometimes you have to look around a little bit to find the free versions but there's still free versions out there and so here's a let's go take a look at the try all right so what'll happen is that they'll give you a free version for 7 days and you can go ahead and scan all your systems usually there's a limited number like on the free version there used to be 16 IP addresses so for a small office home office that's going to be more than adequate now if you go to buy it it's pretty pricey okay $5,300 per year but usually let's just see if I can find uh their Home Essentials they used to have a product called Home Essentials that was free up to 16 IP addresses let's see what we can find here see BL P Bings it up okay as part of the table Miss table Miss allows you scan oh it is up to 16 IP addresses with the same highspeed that subscribers enjoy okay please note that ness's Essentials does not allow you to perform compliance checks or content audits live results or use ness's Virtual appliance using ness's Essentials for Education register here and we can get it all right I do have in Master hacker book a demonstration of uh how to use nessus we use the nessus essential it's a 16 IP address um I think David we should do a a tutorial just on nessus in the future great yeah but this is I put this on the list because you need to have some familiarity being ins cyber security of how to use vulnerability scanners now there's lots and lots of vulnerability scanners out there nessus has been around longer than most of them have and it's widely used it's it's the most widely used so let's do plan on doing a tutorial on using nesses because it's a really good tool for identifying potential vulnerabilities in your system because it doesn't necessarily find all the vulnerabilities it finds potential vulnerabilities and then it can narrow down your task of trying to be able to patch and make your system uh harder for a hacker to get into now everybody who's starting out in hacking wants to hack wifi right and so and so the granddaddy the granddaddy of wi-fi hacking tools the original is air crack and air crack I'll just open it up here air crack NG that's air crack NG let's give it a dash each for help screen and it tells me that my help screen is that dash dash help right me we could spend you know once again a whole class on air crack right you can see that it has multiple methods of being able to crack WiFi this is when the web attack first came out in the early part of the 21st century yeah it was widely used for that so here's some psk this would be modern systems that usually what WPA2 and so this this tool is great for being able to hack uh Wi-Fi passwords you know one of the things that has happened is that with WPA2 essentially what you're doing is you're trying to guess the password you're you're you're creating a good password list and then using aircraft or others to crack it so the first thing air crack does is it connects to your system okay let's point out first of all to use air crack and some of these other Wi-Fi cracking tools you have to have an air crack compliant WiFi adapter right and I recommend the alpha cards you they're they're cheap they're relatively cheap they work really well you don't have to have the latest and greius so you can go out and buy a used one off eBay or other places and they're going to work just as well for you because really speed is not the key to the speed of the Wi-Fi connection is not going to really make a whole lot of difference the the CPU speed is what's going to help you be able to crack the password so you can go out and buy a cheap one for 105 $20 I think new they cost 440 $50 and this tool will allow you to be able to at least attempt to crack your passwords but you have to first have a wifi a air crack compliant adapter if you're using a uh virtual machine you're going to have to have even though you're using a laptop with a Wi-Fi adapter in it you're going to have to go ahead and connect via USB your new air crack compatible adapter usually it's going to be an alpha or something because even though right now so for instance right now I'm connected via Wi-Fi but for my virtual machine if I go IW list which is the the wireless interface list okay now let's go IW config see I go IW config you can see all the interfaces which I have five of them on the system but none of them are Wireless but in reality I am connected via Wireless but that wireless connection that Wi-Fi connection is then piped through an eth connection from my host to my virtual machine this is not an issue if you're using C on bare metal you're using it as your primary operating system but in my case here I'm using Windows 10 with Kali as a virtual machine if you're doing that you're going to need to have an extra Wi-Fi adapter via USB to be able to crack passwords now for a beginner in this field there are a number of goys okay because aircrack it's not that hard to use but it it does take a little bit of knowledge okay and I have I have a a three-part video series that users can view on Wi-Fi cracking looking at many different techniques but there are some goys that you can use that make it a little simpler and they're all built upon ear crack and one of them is why fight why fight is basically a gooey that sits on top of air crack and makes cracking passwords a little bit simpler notice it says run as a pseudo so I'm going to go pseudo wi fight and it's going ahead and it's telling me that I need to go ahead and put in some extra tools if I want to use them I don't have to install these right these are this tool these two tools right here are useful for being able to use What's called the pmkid attack which is a interesting attack where it allows you to get the hash right out of the AP without having to capture it between the client and the server or the AP and so this is a relatively new it's a two or threey old attack but this tool is is basically a gooey on top of the of air crack and it's an excellent tool simple to use right and so I recommend it if you're just starting out and in wi-fi hacking then moving on to the next one right we're not going to do any wi-fi hacking here but I just wanted to show you some a couple of the tools right next we have a tool that's probably the best one out there right now if a password cracking and that's hash cat look at hash cat okay here's hash it's got a really really long okay help compated yeah it's very complicated but it's an excellent tool great right and one of the things that we were looking at right here is this is all the different types of hashes so to be able to crack a hash you first of all have to identify what type of hash it is right and oftentimes you can do that there's tools that are built into C uh that will help you identify the hash uh for instance if I remember correctly the hash identifier I got to spell it right all right um if you have a hash and you want to know what type of hash it is there it is this tool will allow you to put a hash into right here at this prompt and it'll tell you what type of hash it is once you know what type of hash it is then you can use a tool like hash capap to crack it and hashcat is probably right now the best password cracking tool out there but the first step of course is once you grab your hash use hash identifier or there's other tools like it that they're not 100% accurate but they're pretty accurate they'll give you like 98% accuracy occasionally they'll get it wrong but this is an excellent tool for identifying and I'm not putting hash identifier on my 10 it's more of a a tool that you need as kind of a a helper to using hash capap next okay I want to move a little bit into some more little bit more sophisticated tools that we user your viewers might be interested in one of them that came out a few years ago was called gidra okay and gidra G is a is a tool that was developed by NSA so if you have if you have a you have a lot of reservations about uh about the oh I'll just I'll just pull up some nice um pictures of I don't know if I have it on this system but I'll pull up some screenshots of it that gidro was developed by the NSA for doing engineering and previous to them releasing this as an open source project you you had to spend some serious money for things like I Ida Pro and others and this tool does almost everything that Ida Pro does and it's free so you can get it and here's that this is gidra here and this is actually analysis of we working with Wan cry right here wac cry was one of those tools that was used the tural blue as a as its entry point for ransomware and so in one of our classes we were doing an analysis of it and we use gidra to do it we have a class coming up in February in reverse engineering we'll be using gidra extensively in that class so it's one of those tools it's kind of an advanced tool I wouldn't say that it's a entrylevel tool by any means because reverse engineering is kind of an advanced topic but it's one of those tools that's free and the more you know about it the more you're going to understand malware and more you understand malware the better you're going to be as a cyber security pro and as a hacker I think it's one of those essential tools that advanced at least to the intermediate level is to be able to use speed and the be beauty of it is that it's free keep that on your list and then as my final tool all right and you know this is kind of goes to what I was saying I've been saying repeatedly on your show and to my students is that I believe that hacking radio signals is really the next level in terms of and David you've done a number of of tutorials using Flipper Zero and it's been widely acclaimed and used around the world but I really prefer the hack RF the hack RF has been around for a while and and the difference really between the Flipper Zero and hack RF is that the hack RF is basically a transceiver right with very has a little bit of software some firmware built into it but your computer okay and all of its capabilities and all of the tools that you can download into your Ki or Dragon OS remember we talked a little bit about Dragon OS Dragon OS has hundreds of radio hacking tools and in most cases the hack rf1 which is about a $350 tool so just be clear it's not free by any means it's very capable of handling all of those radio hacking tasks you know it's not the best it's not the fastest but it certainly gives the beginner a capability to do a lot of the radio hacking its limitations are speed okay it's relative slow compared to some of the more advanced tools and the other limitation is that it's only half duplex it can only send or receive and can't do them simultaneously so there are some attacks where you need to have both send and receive re at the same time and some of the more advanced tools can do that but if you're starting out and you want to get started and becoming you know a radio hacker which my God it's like it's one of those really unexplored areas that I'm so I'm so glad the Flipper Zero came out because the Flipper Zero has made everybody aware of all the possibilities of radio hacking we've been ignoring for all these years exactly and so we've begun a series of classes um radio hacking we just did one last week on Cell system hacking uh we have one coming out on satellite hacking in 2024 and an advanced radio hacking in 2024 so I throw that out there because I want to make people aware of hey if you're starting out in hacking don't limit yourself to tcpip because there's so many other things out there you know like even your WiFi your cell phone your satellite connections your remote control you know these are all radio signals and it's just we're just on The Cutting Edge of exploring what we can do in terms of hacking those types of signs so with that I think that concludes my 10 my 10 best my 10 most important let's put it that way and let's come back in a later episode Let's do an episode just on nessus and maybe we can even do an episode just on metas and deeper deeper into those tools um I think there's an awful lot of people who cover wi-fi hacking out there so I mean if somebody really Dragon might be a good one what's that I'd love to do dragon OS Dragon o is great and uh we maybe can do some some relatively simple using a hack RF that' be simple R Radio hacks that uh the beginners might be interested in doing okay by the way I really want to thank you for sharing so much knowledge but I know this is just the tip of the iceberg right because you you know so much so can you show us your website and I believe you got good news about your website right yes here's here's our website right here and we have a brand new website coming up in January we hope to have it complete it's it's in the final stages here this is our old website we're looking at right here but we're going to have a new website uh with the same material and more material but maybe uh a little easier to navigate and find what you're looking for um so this is our our current website and you know we always adding to it like every week we post something new and different on it here's a ransomware build youall ransomware there among other things uh so hopefully if you really want to learn more about any of these subjects that we talked to talked about there's more free tutorials here on hackers rise and if you're really serious about studying cyber security we offer multiple packages that uh the individual can purchase and delve deeper into those including our ultimate package is what we call subscriber Pro which includes all of our courses both the entry level to the advanced and everything in between and it's a three-year program so after three years you know you're can become a professional cyber security exper a professional cyber Warrior I've listened to some of your courses I haven't attended them live because you do live but I've I've watch some of the um the recordings and they're fantastic so I mean for everyone who's watching I mean you've just seen Occupy The Web teach a whole bunch of stuff and um he goes in a lot more detail in his courses highly recommended I've put links below it's an affiliate link so Occupy The Web thank you for supporting the channel by you know giving me an affiliate affiliate link so everyone who's watching I highly suggest you go and uh buy those courses if you can afford reped but otherwise you know use the free content we've got lots and lots of videos on my channel and Occupy The Web has also been interviewed on other channels Occupy The Web is always I really really want to thank you you know for helping the Next Generation and spreading the knowledge and not just teaching hackers but like teaching people who want to defend networks I know you've you you've told me previously that you've had people from the military and all kinds of places come to your courses to see what hackers can actually do so that they can protect themselves hey we we recently got some students coming in from a a special uh police unit in Belgium just signed up and so we're real pleased to have them and that was a nice thing for them to come in they signed up as subscriber Pro I also want to just put a plug in in that we're offering 20% off right for the viewers on your channel appreciate by using the coupon code bomble just David's last name and you get automatically 20% off on anything I appreciate it man thanks so much for supporting the community you know and um in the old old days you know people used to try and like hide their knowledge or store it because they didn't want to lose their jobs and our you know I appreciate you sharing it with the young people people who trying to get into cyber thanks thanks David I've always I enjoy sharing my knowledge and hopefully people appreciate you know what we're doing here together and so I hope to keep coming back and doing more and more of these with you so for everyone who's watching you know I really want to get Occupy The Web back you've got to give us ideas of the things that you want to see we've we've already given some ideas but put in the comments below the stuff that you want to see Occupy The Web looking forward to many many more interviews thanks so much thanks Damon",

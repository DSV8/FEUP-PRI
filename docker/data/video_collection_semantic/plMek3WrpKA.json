    "description": "The camera is one of the most used apps of any smart phone.  Taking pictures of your lunch, snapping your life story... its important to know what the quality is like before making a phone purchase.  Come watch as I compare the video quality between the New OnePlus 3 smartphone, and the flagship Galaxy S7 Edge from Samsung.  Will the flagship killer actually beat the Flagship?  Make sure to vote in the video poll and tell me what you think looks best in the comments!!  I test the higest resolution 4k, along with 1080p, different kinds of stabilization like the EIS and OIS, as well as slow motion.  The front facing camera makes an appearance as well.

    "transcript": "Today were going to be doing a test between the OnePlus 3 and the Galaxy S7 Edge. Both of the cameras are mounted to the same rig so itll be held equally as Im walking around. I will also keep all of the settings on automatic and Im using the stock camera apps so the comparison will be fair between the two of them. Im going to need your help to decide which camera is better, the Galaxy S7 Edge or the OnePlus 3. Im going to leave a poll up in the corner if this video so you can vote at the end of the video. And you can also leave your opinion down in the video comments. Well start off in 4K, then well drop down to 1080p to see if the image color or stabilizing is any different at that resolution. Well do the front facing cameras and well also go into slow motion. So well test every aspect of the video camera on both phones. Make sure to pay attention to things like the color quality, the resolution, the image stabilizing, the white balanceeverything. Lets get started. So right now both cameras are shooting in 4K. Both cameras also have OIS image stabilizing, so the camera itself is compensating for the motion as Im walking which is pretty cool. Its not an electronic stabilization. Its an actual physical image stabilizing. So Im walking right now. Im going to try running. Still shooting in 4K. Both of these cameras are shooting at 30 frames a second right now. Before we get started with the walking front facing camera test, I just want to thank everyone who has subscribed to my YouTube channel. 200,000 subscribers is phenomenal. When I first started making jeep and motorcycle repair videos 4 years ago that number wasnt even on my radar so thank you so much for watching! Lets keep going. So this is the front facing camera on both the Galaxy S7 Edge and the OnePlus 3. The OnePlus 3 is going to be shooting in 1080p, the Galaxy S7 Edge resolution is a little bit higher, its quad HD 1440. You can also check the white balance and the depth of field so you can look back on the path behind me and see how far back the quality goes. With enough leaves like this its also nice to see what kind of bit rate were working with. Ill have the bit rate listed up in the top corners as well. Bit rate is basically the quality of the image inside of the resolution. So having a higher bit rate is a good thing because theres more information there. And if theres lots of weeds and detail on the background, its usually more of that bit rate. Obviously YouTube is going to compress it a little bit, but we can still see and equal comparison between the two cameras. Even though the Galaxy S7 image is bigger that doesnt always mean better. The image quality could be way better on the OnePlus 3 so its important that you guys let me know what you think and how it looks on the screen youre watching on. Whether its an IPS display that youd see on an iPhone, a regular computer monitor, a CRT monitor from way back in the day, or an AMOLED screen like we see on the Samsung phones. Its going to look a little bit different on every single one of those. So heres the 1080p walking test. Both of these cameras have OIS image stabilizing, optical image stabilizing. The Galaxy S7 also has an extra layer of stabilizing that isnt turned on at the momentits EIS: Electronic Image Stabilization. Sometimes it warps the image. So lets take a look at that. Im going to turn on the EIS for the Galaxy S7 Edge right now. Now the EIS on the Galaxy S7 Edge is enabled so its got dual layers of stabilizing where the OnePlus 3 only has one layer of stabilization. Get a little sun flare in there. One more slow pan in 4K. One thing that I really like about filming in 4K is that there are a whole lot more pixels to work with and you can zoom in on things that you normally wouldnt be able to see with 1080p. It gives you a little more space to work with. Were going to come up here to the skyfind some clouds to look at. There are some over here. It gives you a good indicator of the white balance. You can check out the contrast between the white clouds in the sky. Hopefully there are not too many focus issues with the different phones. Remember I need your help to decide which camera is better. Make sure you comment after watching the video. So keep in mind that there is a huge price difference between these two phones. The OnePlus 3 is the cheaper flagship killer, and the Galaxy S7 Edge is pretty much, you know, the top of the line most expensive phone on the market. So right now just pay attention to the color reproduction on both phones. So Ive had this bike for a while now and about 3 years ago I took this rear tire and sprayed NeverWet, its a hydrophobic spray, around this side of it. So you can see that this side is still white even after 3 years of use and this side is black because of all the brake dust from the calipers and the brake pads. Its kind of interesting. I mean this will clean off pretty easily but that hydrophobic spray is pretty interesting. I never finished the video because I hurt my back and wasnt riding as much as I thought I would, but now its done, I can get my rear rim a wash. Remember its super important that you leave your opinion down in the comments below and you vote in the poll question up here in the corner so we know which camera does better. I have tons of camera tests. We have the Nexus 6P, HTC 10, iPhone 6S Plusyou could watch this all day long. Please consider subscribing if you enjoyed this video. Hope to see you around.",

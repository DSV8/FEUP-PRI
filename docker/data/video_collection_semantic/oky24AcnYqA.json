    "transcript": "(upbeat music) - Thank you guys all for coming to this meeting. I just have a very, just a quick little announcement that we might be having a few new additions to the family. I know, I know, by this time normally, we would have already had our new family member here, but it's okay. Things have been delayed. It's been a crazy year. You guys have all been through a lot. We've all been through a lot together and I'm glad that we could be here, because on October 13th, that is when we will find out more about our new friend. I know I'm really excited too. Do you guys have any questions? Can I answer anything for you? Any concerns? Oh, will it have USB-C? I don't know. I'm not gonna get into rumors. I feel like that's something that I've done in the past. And now nearing the moment that we're gonna find out all of the information I don't want, I don't want any more spoilers. I don't, I just, that's a good question, that's fair. Anybody else? No, this does not mean that we love you any less. It just means we have a new member of the family. This has nothing to do with the fact that you're not 5G or this has nothing to do with that. It's just, and I understand your concern. I completely, I get it. If anybody gets it, I get it. Okay, I hope that we're all very excited for this moment. It's something that we've all been waiting for. And I look forward to bringing home our new family member, members, for you guys all to meet them. Thank you for coming to this meeting. - [Man] Maybe look at the camera and be like okay, that was silly, but let's talk about the new iPhone. - No, that's it the video is over. - [Man] Oh that's the vedio. - That's it. - [Man] Oh, okay. - No, I'm just kidding. I don't really know. (laughs) Guys, I don't even know what to say really. I'm just really excited for the new iPhone. Obviously you guys, this is something that I look forward to. Basically I revolve my entire year around when the iPhone is gonna be launched. And I think we really did expect this to be released later. We don't really know. There's so many rumors out there and I've kind of stopped looking at the rumors. I know I've made a couple of rumor videos before. I just kind of wanna be surprised. I mean, I know what I've read. I know what I've reported to you guys that I've seen online but at this point I'm done, no more looking. It is, as I'm recording this is Tuesday October 6th, and I'll be posting this October 7th. And at that point, you know, we're gonna wait until 13th, the big event, they sent the invites out today on Tuesday the 6th. And it's crazy because I woke up this morning and as I was walking the dog my first thought was, feels like iPhone season. Like I just sensed it. I tweeted, then 15 minutes later in my email, I received the invite to the Hi, Speed. And my sister, Jenna, actually sent me her invite first because I was busy editing. And then I saw her text message come through. And I, (laughs) this is really silly but I thought that they had like mistyped her name. And I thought that they were calling her speed, like hi speed or hi Justine, hi Jenna. And it took me a second to realize no, they were saying hello to speed because that must mean something speedy is around the corner. But I think at this point we're all pretty well aware that 5G is the future and the next iPhone, or iPhones will most likely be 5G. I mean, what? - [Man] Possibly will be a lot more than 120 hertz. - No, but it's true. Will we have 120 Hertz display? Will we finally get a USB-C charger in the iPhone? I feel like if they do put a USB-C charger in it's gonna be in the pro models. I feel like some of the lower end models, I had said I wasn't gonna go get into talking about rumors, but I feel like, kind of just have to, there's supposed to be four iPhones. There's gonna be a mini. Oh my gosh, I just don't know. That's what I've read, I've seen it. Aah a mini iPhone. Like what size do we think the mini would be? Do we think it would be the size of the original iPhone? Could you imagine this little mini iPhone with like a full like all red retina, like an updated version of this. Could you, like this. If this was updated into a today version of something similar to, I mean, this is kind of more along the lines I feel like of what, the rumors that I've seen. This more kind of a boxy edge design, which I do really really like, but there's something so beautiful about this original iPhone. Like, it is just so iconic. Like if they went back and did a re-release of this iPhone as a new generation phone. (sighs) Apple, if you're not thinking about it, if this is something that you weren't thinking about before, and I just planted the seed, like please let it grow. Let it flourish. I think, I mean, maybe I might be the only one that buys it but that's okay. (laughs) It's okay. Anyway, I am looking forward to it. It's also gonna be crazy because, you know, last year we were all celebrating together the release and the announcement of the new iPhone. And we're back to doing the digital thing again. And I think Apple has been doing a really incredible job of their digital events. A lot of companies have really completely changed the way that they're doing events. And I think people are really stepping it up. And I think Apple. There's a fly so big. Oh God, he's so massive. - [Man] There he is. - There he goes, he's out. By having very impressed with a lot of the press briefings that I've attended virtually for tons of different companies. So I think Apple has been really setting the bar because obviously there's have by far been the absolute best. (dog barks) Maddie agrees. (beep) Apple has been doing such an incredible job that they have. My God, there are so many flies in my house. I keep the door open so the dog can go in and out. (laughs) The flies also go in and out. It's so big. Yeah, It's a different one. He's a different shape. So in conclusion, let's freaking get hyped up man. October 13th, I'll see you guys on the internet. That's it, that's it. The end of the video. Okay kids, do you guys wanna go to the park? Gosh, so many beautiful phones. This is still one of my favorite gold colors. Like this, oh, like it's just beautiful. All right, I guess say I put these guys back where we got them. Don't worry, I'll bring you guys back out on 13th. (dog barks) We can celebrate together. Maddie has it, he has an iPhone. Actually he has an iPad. It's for the DJ set, I know. Bye. I clearly have issues. (upbeat music)",

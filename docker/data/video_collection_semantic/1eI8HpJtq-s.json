    "transcript": "(upbeat futuristic music) - I almost can't believe we're finally here. I've reviewed so many products over my lifetime on YouTube that it's almost ridiculous and the question always comes up in the background, \"Well, Marques, when are you gonna make, design your own product, right?\" So two years of materials work and design work and basically a lifetime of inspiration later, I'm actually holding the thing, this is the first one. It's called M251. Why is it call 251, you might be asking. Good question. I'm glad you asked. So this is still a collaboration after all. I could have all the ideas for shoe stuff in the world but I still need someone to build the shoe. So Atoms is the company that's come through for me on this one. They've had their Model 000 and then Model 001. They've been hailed some of the most comfortable shoes of all time and I agree but this would be something completely new for both of us. The length of my first ever YouTube video, on tech, yeah, that one, was two minutes and 51 seconds long, a new beginning and this is also sort of a new beginning. (dramatic upbeat music) Now if you know me, you already knew I like shoes but I'm not suddenly a shoe designer out of nowhere. So the idea was that I would take all sorts of bits and pieces from different shoes that I like, shoes that I've worn, shoes that I've seen, and try to combine as many of that in one place as I possibly can. So the lightweightness of NMDs, the silhouette of Jordan 1s, things like the soul and the elastic laces of Atom's shoes and the little bits and details and tiny things from Blazers and Off-White collabs. And so we went through a lot of prototypes and a lot of things like that to sort of accomplish that, put them all in one place. So the process was really fun actually and we went through as many combinations as possible and went through a ton of different ideas and designs. We're trying to figure out what was possible and what wasn't in a shoe. We have a lot of older prototypes that we didn't go with that had things like fitment issues and support issues and material issues and we went through and basically Atoms could tell me, like, this will be possible versus this won't be possible. This will be more expensive versus this won't be more expensive. And so all the different parts of the shoe had to come together from our combination of expertise and my taste. It was one of the most fun processes I've ever gone through. And then the other part of that was I literally got to wear them around and start testing them. So once we got working prototypes, like this one, I wore for weeks. Literally started showing up in videos by accident just because I was just daily driving these things every day testing my own creation. So we went through dozens of samples over two plus years. I mean this is a long process where, like, we have an idea for a YouTube video and we can make that in a couple of days. This is something that's been in our heads and in the background for a long time but we finally have come to a final version and I really, really like it and I'm now excited to, like, get you guys to actually wear it and try it yourselves. So now I can't review my own product, actually I'm really excited for other shoe reviewers to be able to do that, but what I can do is tell you all about it. So the silhouette is pretty simple, right? It's not fully high top, but obviously not a low top either. It's a really comfortable daily mid and this upper is a combo of synthetic leather and then we actually have a recycled mesh fabric that's a nice balance between breathable and supportive and it took a lot of samples to get that right. And if you're curious, development wise, this soul was actually the hardest part. So I'm on my feet all day. My job as a video producer in this studio does involve a lot of walking. It's a lot of moving around and crouching and kneeling and all kinds of stuff like that. So comfort is a high priority. So this outsole has to be supportive enough to actually function and hold up the shoe so it doesn't collapse, but also still be soft enough through the midsole that it's really comfortable. And this bottom soul is proprietary. It's all very, I dunno, came together super nicely. We also did something a little bit interesting, just if you see the shape along the side. So this is a little bit structural it's a little heel to toe drop. So if you're used to wearing shoes that are a lot flatter, like Js or Converses, you will notice and feel a bit of a difference with this shape and it's really good. There's a copper lining in here, that's naturally antimicrobial, which does help prevent odors, which is awesome. My signature and size stamp is on the tongue. We've got this loop on the back too, which is actually functional and that's where we put the Atoms logo, which is the top one here and the MKBHD parallelogram in the same style. And of course the elastic laces, underrated. A lot of people don't know about these but you can sort of just treat them like normal laces, maybe tie 'em little looser or tighter, and then they flex a little bit to support your foot as you're moving around. There's little details like the New York City tag, the 251 is stitched, even taking it apart, even the soul is custom designed and it kind of cups your foot a little bit and is soft as well. All of this stuff is awesome. I really couldn't be happier with how these turned out. Now if you get these, you have to promise me one thing. Wear your kicks. I am such, like, there's this whole culture of, like, you get shoes and then you have to like baby them and take really good care of them for proper resale value. No, no, no. You gotta actually daily these and, like, wear 'em out and put them to work. I still get, I still get roasted on Instagram for, like, crouching down in a picture and then the toe box is creased and then all the comments are like, \"What are you doing? You're ruining your shoes.\" So no, wear your kicks, crease your kicks, wear them in all four seasons. I'm gonna be dailying these things. We put a lot of work into the engineering of them to be able to do that. So winter, spring, summer, fall, snow, mud, you'll be able to see mine on social media getting dirty as I wear them a ton. We love that. So I'm gonna make sure these are available as worldwide as we possibly can. And maybe you'll even see me pop up in a retail shop once in a while to help just get the word out about them. And I hope if you get them that you wear them too. So this 251 is an exciting new beginning. Also, I've been waiting a long time to do this. (upbeat music)",

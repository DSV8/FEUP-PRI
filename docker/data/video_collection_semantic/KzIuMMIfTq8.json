    "transcript": "- AMD's launch of the 7900XT and 7900XTX went about as well as they could have possibly hoped. For the MSRP of $900 or $1000, they are basically within striking distance of NVIDIA's RTX 4080, which costs anywhere from two to $300 more, but while AMD's performance and traditional rasterized games was competitive, in ray-traced games, not so much, and when it came to acoustics and thermals, AMD clearly fell behind NVIDIA's Founder's Edition cards. I mean, (plastic wrapping crinkling) it's a compatibility advantage being smaller, but man were those things loud and hot! That is where this comes in. Meet the Power Color 7900XTX Red Devil. This is a limited edition card that comes with all the same basic specs as the regular 7900XTX, so 24 gigs of GDDR6 memory, 6,144 stream processors, and the latest connectivity. So back here, we'll find a single HDMI 2.1 port and three display port 2.1 ports, supporting the new UHBR standard, though it should be noted that only two of those DPs can be used at the same time. Let's take a closer look at the accessory package, shall we? This is a very traditional unboxing here 'cause I'm technically on my day off, but, ooh! Now that's pretty stylin'! Oh, that's cool! It's a back plate (back plate clanking) and it doesn't go on like that. (Linus chuckling) Look, I'm working on it! Okay?! Okay, that's pretty cool! More importantly, you're probably wondering about the business pieces of this card. We've got a PCI-e Gen 4x16 interface. It's a three and a half slot cooling solution. There's a load of RGB on here and this is huge. Rather than go with the newfangled 12-pin PCI-e connector, which does have cool features like the card being able to report its capabilities back to the power supply and whatnot. They've gone with a traditional 3x8-pin PCI-e connection. So, this is probably overkill unless you're doing some kind of like volt modding and overclocking on this thing or something like that given it's 315-watt power budget in OC mode, but at least you know that your power supply should be compatible right out the box. Speaking of OC mode, there's a little BIOS switch up here that allows you to switch between OC mode which is what it's in now, or Silent mode, which actually locks it at 303 watts. It's not a huge difference. It's unlikely to be the kind of thing that you would even really notice day to day, especially at the kind of performance that you're getting out of this card, regardless of OC mode or Silent mode, but hey, at least it's there. Why don't we go ahead and fire this thing up on a test bench? Oh, sorry. What's, oh! Oh! There's a whole bunch of stuff in here! Okay, I totally lied. (Linus scoffing) Oh! Oh, I know what this is! Oh, that's super cool! Okay. They've got one of those modular GPU support brackets in here. So you just, ooh, where is it threaded? Is it this side threaded? Yeah! There we go! Okay, so, it's just got a little weighted base, and then you put this guy on here and it keeps the GPU from sagging at the back. While I hooked this up, Lab sent me a whole report on it, not just performance. So, boost clocks are 2565 with Silent mode clocks at 2525, so we're talking a 40 megahertz difference, but it apparently operated much more efficiently in Silent mode, so it may be that you wanna go with Silent mode. Then again, it's really quiet in OC mode, so, I mean, if you can have another 40 megahertz, then maybe you might as well take it. At the end of the day, the choice is yours. It's not like there's a subscription service to go a little bit faster. I mean, the thing's not a car. I think that the cool back plate is actually interfering with the M.2 drive's heat sink. Yeah. Okay. Sorry, back plate. (back plate clanking) See you later. The board has 21 phases, 12 plus three plus two for the GPU and two plus two for the memory in order to deliver great stability and overclocking capabilities. It's not only capable of over 400 watts, but by having a V-run like that, it'll run cooler and I would expect it to have better reliability. This is part of why it has a $100 price increase over the regular 7900XTX. I guess I don't have drivers installed, but we can already tell that it's gonna run quieter than the reference card at idle because you can see the fans are not spinning and that's despite the fact that we're actually in the OC BIOS, so I'm really happy to see that. I mean, that's gonna be because of this gigantic cooler. It's got eight heat pipes, a metal support brace to keep the card nice and stiff which, along with that support bracket, is gonna help keep it in place and not sag in your case, and it's got a triple, what looks like 100-millimeter fan-cooling solution, and all three of them are a 100 mil. I've actually seen triple-fan ones that have two big ones and one small one, but this one goes big all the way. There we go. Everything seems to be working properly with the drivers. You can tell because, well, what's that? Lttstore.com. Believe it or not, this video is brought to you by Shopify, who powers lttstore.com. Shopify is easy to use and it's an all-in-one commerce platform for anyone, regardless of your technical ability and experience. It allows you to start, grow, and manage your business, and let me tell you, guys, we have had an absolutely great experience using Shopify. You can sell online. You can sell in person. We've actually done pop-up shops before in the past, anything from like a couple-hour event to a multi-day event, and they support all major social platforms. They support businesses along the entire journey, from their first sale to full scale, and they power millions of businesses in 175 countries. One of the things that I love most about Shopify is the super detailed, (fingers snapping) and I cannot stress this enough, high performance dashboard and analytics. If you wanna run a report for the entire year, for example, some platforms, man, I swear, you can sit there waiting for what feels like forever for your report to come up. Shopify, nice and snappy. Shopify believes in a future where commerce has more voices and they're reducing the barriers to business ownership one step at a time. So, head to shopify.com/shortcircuit and jumpstart your small business today. Who knows? If everything goes according to plan, your business might not stay small for long. Let's get some games launched and let's see how this GPU's doin', and you know what's wild? All that noise right now, that's actually the Play Button PC. It's completely silent in here. I can't wait to see how this thing does once a game's actually running 'cause the reference card is really loud. With that said, it's $100 cheaper, theoretically, so, I mean, you can find it for that price, and if these graphs are anything to go by, the performance difference is pretty negligible, anywhere from zero to one FPS. So, if your hope was that you were gonna pick up an OC version of the 7900XTX and it'll, like, solve AMD's ray-tracing performance woes, the answer is, I'm afraid not. The good news, however, is that this is \"Cyberpunk 2077\" running at 3440x1440 Ultra, sans ray-tracing, and she is one smooth boy, but that's the thing, right, is would I pay another $200 to turn on ray-tracing right now? Even in game. Gotta give 'em credit. Not only are these fans (fan buzzing) like damn near silent, like, my mic is right here, (faint whirring sound from fans) but actually, this is very, very minimal coiling and that's something that will vary from one unit to another, so you might get one of these cards and it's more, or even less, but our sample is very reasonable. Once you have that inside a case, you're not gonna hear that. Oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry! Oh, I'm sorry! Oh, I'm so sorry! And I'm sorry, this video's over! Subscribe to Short Circuit.

    "transcript": "- Case apart and put it back together. Oh boy! Wow! That was scary! Okay! Guys, I have a treat for you today. It is much anticipated, for me at least. The O11 Air Mini. This is Lian Li's mesh case that fits an ATX form factor motherboard, but it's small still. And I'm really excited, let's get it open. Now, what I'm excited for with this case is the modularity. So you can take this case and it'll fill an ATX it'll fit an ITX, it'll fit a MATX and it says it even fits EATX, but I don't really believe it. So we'll have to find out there. But let's, I hate getting cases out of the boxes. Voila! Wow, look at all that mesh. Ooh, what do we have here? A little goodie. Radiator offset mounting bracket, ah, yes! So these are so we can put in as long of a rad as we can fit. I think it's 240 mil max in this thing. Got a nice, big thick, I think it's three millimeter, a glass panel, and we have mesh on four sides. Front, top, back, the right side. And on the bottom, we don't have mesh. But we do have a fan filter. This is a rather large chungus to pull it out, but it works well enough. We have a 120 millimeter fan in the back and that's PWM and up front kind of hard to see cause it's mesh, but, can you see that? We got two 140s upfront. Right now it's in the seven IO slot configuration. You can make this five slots and that will move the motherboard slot down. And that gives you a little bit of extra radiator clearance up in the top. Because you are a little limited. Just, I think, it's a 25 millimeter top spacing max. So you'd have to run a thin red. If you wanted to run something up here with an ATX motherboard. We do have support for a full ATX power supply in here, which is super nice. Especially when you start getting into higher wattages. Things get a little bit expensive. Let's open it up and take a look inside. Oh, I forgot. I gotta tell you about honey. Thanks to honey for sponsoring this video.

So get honey and save money today at joinhoney.com/shortcircuit. These absolute chungus thumbscrews. Which ones do I even do? There's so many of them. Okay, that one's top for sure. There is no filter. So Lian Li claims that this mesh is fine enough to keep dust out. I have my doubts, but it is pretty fine, but at the same time, that will affect airflow. So time will tell and that's something I can't, unfortunately, do for you on short circuit. Okay, where are we here? Does it slide? Ah, okay! Once you get the top off, this just slides out. There's two little retention pegs that slide into these slots here. We got the two 140 mils. That's nice to see it's, you know, this case is I think a hundred dollars for the black and 110 for the white. And that's not a small amount of money, but the fact that it comes with fans, like that's what, 30, 40 bucks there. So that's nice. And they match, which is just nice. We've got, ooh, Der Bauer, hello! So when it says Der Bauer, you know, they take a little bit of consideration into cooling. Which is nice, given all the fans. And we have, this is really interesting, and we're going to test this. You can fit four hard drives in here apparently. And two SSDs, that is a lot of a storage! We have, the IO comes down in the back, comes up through these two ports. These don't have any grommets, but these do, which is nice. Okay, why don't we try starting to fit some stuff in, let's start with the power supply. I got a big old bin of parts here. I know there is a length limitation. I think it's 200 millimeters on this case, so we're gonna hope this fits. I have hopes and dreams. I mean anything that comes in a velvet bag, hmm hmm. Oh, fan side up. Uh oh, uh oh, will she go? No, oh no, she'll go, she'll go. No, like it's in there. - [Jono] Oh, there's a screw. - Oh geez. - [Jono] Oh, what is? - Oh, it's a Phillips, come on. (man laughing) Okay, well, it's barely in there. Let's see if I can get it to actually fully seat. Like that. Okay, so there's a little elevation down there for airflow, that's kinda nice. Ah, okay. So this is the hard drive accessories and this is the block off plate. So if you want to make it an MATX or smaller case, you put this guy, up at the top here and every one of these panels moves down. And you remove these bottom two panels. - [Jono] I think you're pushing it with that Noctua fan. - No, okay, here's why I grabbed that Noctua fan. It's not just because I'm wearing the shirt today. They claim it holds a 290 millimeter tower cooler and the D15 is 285 millimeters. So if it fits, I'll be very happy. You know, air cooling is the way to go. I'm just putting it out there. Water cooling, yeah, it's cool and all. And you got liquids running around and it looks all pretty, but air cooling. Got a nice big hole cut out in the back so I can kind of avoid... Yeah, uh nah, I should probably put the plate on. Because there seems to be that hard drive sled in the way. So, we'll pull out the D15 while we're at it. The amount of times I've pulled D15s out of boxes here, is too damn high. Come on, get in your hole, good dog. Oh, I don't know, it is right up against that fan there. Oh yeah, no she goes, uh huh. I don't even know what I was worried about. You know, I could see it fitting the ATX. You know, a little bit further up. But you wouldn't be holding anything on here. - [Jono] No, we're not doing the benchmark. - No, no, no, no. We're just testing compatibility here. It's all we got time for. Yeah, if you want to see a whole build of this case, you're going to have to bug Linus. You know, hit him right at Twitter. Just be like, yo, I want to see this case. It looks so cool, build something in it. Usually I mount it this way. You want to put it so that the slots in the tower cooler give you clearance for your RAM, which while I'm here, I might as well put in. When you get to play Candyman, you just get to go grab whatever you feel. And I grabbed some Trident Z Neo 3,600 MHz round. Because I thought it looked cool. Right now I'm pushing the mounting plate back up through the hole so I can get the thumb studs on, or the thumb nuts on. Didn't ever say PC building was glamorous. Sometimes you just got to give a PC a good hug. We don't need to put in fans or anything. It was plenty of RAM clearance because it's a D15, who am I kidding? Oh man, I asked for a GPU, Jono, not a brick. (man laughing) Well, it is literally, it's a dummy GPU. So it is a brick. But holy moly, this is a huge, I guess there's no better test than a... I feel bad for the PCIU slot. (man laughing) There's maybe an inch of clearance. Ooh boy! Yeah, no, we're going to have to go down a slot. Because that's right there. Going to get a little bit of air flow. The other option is they do make a right angle kit. So you can just turn this whole plate sideways. We don't have one, but that guy aint fitting neither. If you had a normal person graphics card, you could probably pull that off. But we do not. We've got a GPU in here and it is large and in charge. Oh, that got way heavier. (man laughing) I mean it went in without affair and that is about as big as you're ever going to want to fit in a case like this. And yeah, I'm kind of impressed it fit. - [Jono] That's why I chose it. - Well, yeah, yeah, it was a good call, Jono. At the end of the day, good call. I didn't even talk about the IO. How did I forget that? Okay, upfront. Super nice to see. We have USBC upfront, critical in these times. Two USB 3.0s, power button, and a combo USB headphone Jack. I kind of wish they had separate jacks, it's just nice. But you know, beggars, can't be choosers. Sorry, yes, combo headphone mic jack and power. This is illuminated. Oh, hard drives! We're going to try and fit four hard drives and two SSDs in the back of here. We'll do that, and then I think we'll bring her home. Okay, I found the oldest hard drives in the LTT inventory. This one I believe is item number 18 in the inventory system. (man laughing) Yeah, B0016. This is the 16th item we ever inventoried. I'm not going to get too crazy and actually bolt them all in. Because that sounds time consuming. But yeah, more or less two there. Wait, there's more! Then we have this sled over here and these guys go on this bracket that we pulled off. Like that's just nice. One fastener, you have one that goes there. One that would go on the underside, under there. I mean, yeah, it'll fit all of these things. It's going to weigh a ton, but it'll fit it. It'll fit four hard drives, two SSDs and whatever graphics cards you can throw at it and anything ATX and smaller. I mean, this is a great option for someone who wants this aesthetic, this form factor. I'm just talking from a, hey, I took this case apart and put it back together. Oh, boy! (man laughing) Wow! What is even holding it in still? Minus one point! Sketchy glass retention. And oh yeah, just for you guys. (plastic static crinkling) Oh, static! (plastic static crinkling) There we are. This is a clearly, well thought out case. You know, there are a lot of parts that if they didn't fit together perfectly here, they wouldn't work at all. And it's impressive that they do fit together and they made such a solid case out of the whole thing. All in all, you have dust filtration the whole way around, hopefully good breathability. Something we can't really test here, but given all the mesh, I can assume there's going to be a lot of airflow. And the form factor is nice. It's wider than a normal case, but squat and small and cute. And it's white. I'm going to say this is a good option. If you're looking for something in this form factor, I'd seriously consider taking a look at this. Went together pretty well, comes with fans. Prices is right. You know, made by reputable makers. Well, that's it for the first look at the O11 Air. If you like our case videos, why don't you look at Alex's Meshify case video. And of course it gets subscribed to short-circuit. (beeping) Join honey.com/source or short-circuit ah, get honey.com/source short, ah, blah, ha, ha, ah. (beeping) I can't say honey five times in a sentence.",

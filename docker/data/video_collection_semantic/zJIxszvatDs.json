    "transcript": "hello good people i'm Eber with Hardware Canucks and not too long ago i got the chance to check out the galaxy a51 from samsung it was a great smartphone for the price in fact it still is if you value factors like a really good display good battery life and satisfactory camera performance my only issue with this smartphone was the performance because my sample only came with 4 gigabytes of RAM and it just couldn't keep up with my usage however a lot of you were curious about its bigger brother the galaxy A71 is it a better buy compared to the a51 are you gaining or losing anything with this smartphone so let's put an end to those questions after this the Razer Viper ultimate the lightest and fastest wireless mouse designed for eSports with an accurate focus plus 20k dpi optical sensor raise your hyper speed wireless technology that is 25% faster than the competition all packed onto lightweight body with optical mouse switches check it out below ok so I want to kick things off with pricing for these phones because they're kinda all over the place so the a71 launch price was $600 and the reason for that is that it came with a 5g tag in the United States of course right now you can pick it up for around four hundred and thirty dollars but if you look around Amazon you'll find one for around three hundred and seventy dollars but that is an international model and doesn't support 5g and it won't work with most of the use carriers so you might end up paying a little bit more for a model that actually works the a51 on the other hand lunch price $400 but you can pick it up for less than 230 dollars at the time while making this video so there's about a two hundred dollar price difference between these phones and guys that is a lot of money but if you factor in the a71 without the 5g compatibility then the price difference is significantly smaller from a design standpoint there is absolutely no difference between these phones the a71 shares the same plastic back with metal side railings really it's just a clone from the outside except for the sides you see a51 has a 6.5 inch 1080p display or as the a71 has a 6 point 7 inch display so it's a little bit taller and a bit wider but having swishes them back-to-back I didn't feel like holding a really huge smartphone on one hand and then a tiny one on the other both are fairly lightweight and someone easier to use in one hand although if you have small hands like really really small hands you might have trouble reaching the top spots on the a51 with your thumb so that's something to keep not've the resolution remains the same between the two not a deal-breaker to me personally and just like I mentioned in my A51 review the a71 has a beautiful fantastic display great colors deeper blacks you get the idea both these phones have mono speaker is paired with headphone jacks but interestingly enough the sound coming off of the a71 had more clarity to the higher ends or the trebles compared to the a51 which sounded compressed I did switch them back to back to see if it was consistent with different genres that I listened to and I definitely notice that the vocals stood out a bit more on the a semi one so I guess that's definitely a bonus with this guy that's for the rest of features Samsung hasn't added anything new to the a71 guys because they still share the same expandable storage options no IP water-resistant rating no wireless charging in fact they still share the same in display fingerprint sensor which surprisingly worked pretty well on the a71 my success rate with this smartphone was far superior compared to the a51 which sounds odd considering that they share the same hardware design but it is what it is now the last thing I wanna touch base on is the a71 5g variant which is available in the United States because it is a lot of money when you consider or when you compare to the a51 so bus it's almost $200 which is which is a lot I think it's ultimately up to you and whether or not if you know you would see yourself taking advantage of 5g when it's the normal standard but for now I just can't see myself justifying spending that kind of money on a 5g model internally there are a few spec variances the SOC s are different so on a51 it comes with an ex nose 96 11 processor whereas on the a71 it comes with a Snapdragon 730 CPU which is running on an efficient eight nanometer architecture the memory configs started six gigabytes of RAM on the a71 instead of four on a51 and I was genuinely curious to see if that extra two gigs of RAM made a difference and you know what it absolutely did because the difference was nine-day after I switched from the a51 to the a71 multitasking performance was way better on the smart phone ask just load up so much faster and it just fits my usage when I'm using apps like Photoshop Instagram Twitter and especially when I'm editing photos this thing can actually keep up with my usage and if you're in the same place as I am when you're constantly on social media or if you're just using your phone or if you're tied down to your smartphone for the most part this thing will keep up with your workflow or your usage but if you don't care about specs if you don't care about performance and if you want to save some money a51 still gets a job done the other bonus feature with the a71 is better battery life because this phone comes with a 4,500 million power battery versus a four thousand milliamp hour battery on the a51 so you can push this thing to 2 days maybe even more if you use it lightly and that is also a win win and as I mentioned earlier the size difference between the two is not that significant so I personally think that you are getting a lot for the size or for the exercise if that makes sense alright so the last difference between these phones is the camera setup it's nothing significant but I discovered something really interesting so they both come with the same 12 megapixel F 2.2 ultra wide-angle camera the same macro and depth sensors for light focus but the main white camera is where things get a bit interesting the a fifty one comes with a 48 megapixel F 2.0 sensor whereas the a71 comes with a sixty four megapixel F 1.8 sensor now don't assume that a higher megapixel sensor or a larger sensor would automatically yield better photos because higher megapixels they just don't mean anything to a smartphone because it ultimately comes down to the way how the sensor treats or sees colors and then how it processes photos let's start with the ultra wide-angle camera keep in mind that both phones don't have focus control in this mode but you single enough the a51 produced a vibrant and contrast image compared to the a71 the photos also tend to be a bit brighter on the a51 and this was really interesting to me because both these phones again have the same ultra wide-angle sensor but they capture and process photos differently oh and by the way I did say both scene optimizer and these were all taken in Auto mode now switching over to the regular wide-angle sensors things get even more interesting I noticed that the a semi one captured true-to-life colors compared to the a51 and given that it has a larger sensor you're gonna get a shallower depth of field so if that's something that you're into a71 is the way to go it also processes skin tones accurately and you don't get that magenta look like what's found on the a51 and if you're looking at detail honestly I couldn't tell the difference between the two I mean here's a shot I've got some water droplets on the leaves and zooming in can you really tell if there's anything different probably not low-light performance also tends to favor the a semi one because it just nails white balance and most importantly it captures colors that are actually true because strawberries are red guys it's not pink like what the a51 thinks personally if I were to pick a winner here I would hands down get the a semi one because the camera performance is more consistent and better than the a51 but I'm gonna let you guys be the judge here which one of these photos look better to you finally these selfie cameras both these phones they share the same sensors but interestingly as I said earlier they just processed them differently as you can see the skin tones look totally different both these phones share the same video recording capabilities I didn't notice a huge difference between image quality or even microphone quality between these smart phones but if you're interested in checking out how they look or how they sound make sure to check out my a51 review which will be linked up right over here so that pretty much wraps up this comparison between the a51 and the a71 from Samsung I hope I was able to answer questions that you guys had in my a51 review and honestly if I'm contemplating between these two smartphones I wouldn't hands down pick the a71 simply because it's got a bigger battery the camera performance is far superior compared to the a51 because the colors are more to life you know you're not getting photos that look like pink unlike what the a51 things because this thing for some reason things that red is pink so that to me was just super odd and finally there's the performance aspect because I would highly recommend getting six of RAM or the model that comes with six gigs of RAM because I personally noticed that it was a day-night difference switching from a sample that only comes with four gigs of ram now if you live in the United States things can get a little bit interesting and somewhat confusing because the a71 comes in a 5g variant and it is significantly expensive compared to the a51 it's almost a $200 price difference between the two but if you can find a non 5g variant that works with your carrier then go for it because this thing is just a much better buy in my opinion so on that note thank you so much for watching and I'll talk to you guys in the next one",

    "transcript": "- [Krazy Ken] I don't feel good about that. This is gonna be a long day. We're just gonna pretend that this is all correct and it's gonna work. You (beeping) kidding me dude? This makes everything a lot easier. (electronic music) Hey guys how you all doin'? Really? That's just great. We're back today with the good black. Macintosh TV or as one commenter called it the Blackintosh, which honestly, I really like. However the system software is a little subpar for me. I know you're gonna be like Ken, the thing came out like in 1993 give it a break. Yes, I know. However. In the Apple CD tech video log, I stumbled upon this disc which was left in the caddy from the drive I bought on eBay. Was it left in there on purpose? I have no idea. But I have it now. Yes, it is a system software disc for the Performa, but I'm willing to bet that the Mac OS 7.6 Essentials will still install on this Mac TV. If not, well then I'll have to go to plan B which I don't have yet but I will make a plan B if we need one. So we're gonna try this out first. 7.6 is way newer and it will have a lot more features that will make the computer more usable. So in to the caddy you go. Oh yeah that's right. The computer probably needs to be on for that to work. Haha I'm an idiot, boot it up. There's the start up sound. Kind of quiet. Again I think there is a problem with the board that is making the speakers really, like not muted but just really hard to hear. Anyway in you go. And here we are at the desktop. Running 7.1. Again this is a Performa CD so it may not work but we're gonna try it. Restore all software, I wanna see what this is. Oh restore all software. Oh, data file, okay. I wonder what software came with the Performa. We're gonna find out because that's another benefit of doing this. If it works we can get some more software on this computer because there really isn't much. Desk images, let's see what's in here. Oh disc copy, disc tools. Okay sweet. Let's just putz around in here for a sec. Boop, some of the volumes you selected can't be repaired. You cannot repair the start up disc. Yes, that makes sense. Let's verify it at least. I mean how much drive space is even on here? But yeah we can at least run disc first aid. Let's just see what it finds. Oh that looks familiar doesn't it? Disc utility spat out the same information for actually it might still spit out the same kind of information. That hasn't changed but it doesn't really need to. Okay it looks okay. Do we have enough space. To install. We have 7.5 megabytes available. All right I don't feel good about that. We might have a problem. But let's find out. Resources from software. Restore system software. Expecting some kind of error. In order to run this program you must have started from the oh, oh, well we can do that. Let's just see if we can set it to the CD. Looks like we can. All right so we got that. Let's reboot. And it ejected the CD, well you, you, you asshole. That's not gonna help. Oh my gosh guys. This is gonna be a long day. Yeah set the startup disc to the CD. Reboot, oh, I'm just gonna eject the CD before I reboot ha ha ha. Yeah, not very, Oh. 'Kay so it detected the CD but we got this lovely error screen. Good yes. Good. I don't really know what to do. Okay hang on let's just restart. Yeah that thing must only work with the Performa. Okay well I might need to get a different stand alone installer that's not specific to the Performa. I also may need to repartition the disc and actually make one usable volume because otherwise the hard drive space is just rigidly chopped up. I also do have the original system software for the Mac TV. I'm just gonna experiment with that quick before I got putz around eBay and try to find an actual CD that I can use for 7.6 so let's reboot this. This is why it's nice to have two caddies. Just throw that in there. Oh it might still default to the CD-ROM drive. Hmm, I thought it might default to the hard drive now that nothing was inserted. Sounds like it's going off the CD. I don't know if you can hear that but it's just like a little (chattering) sound. It's a really quiet drive. Like quieter than like the current super drive. It sounds even quieter than that. I don't know maybe that's the magic of a caddy. Your clock is not set to the right date and time yes. Oh hello. Here's out little folder looking interface. I've honestly never seen this before. I've never booted off of an old system disc like this. This is new to me. Install system, the hard drive's set up. Disc first aid. Go to finder. Oh that's nice. Mac Check. Oh and then you can actually get individual disc images here. Well that is pretty cool. Sweet. At Ease 1.1. That must be the name of this thing I guess? So yeah 7.1 well that's what we currently have on here so that's not really a problem. Let's see what else, is there any other software on here? Extras, install, install two tidbits, reinstall first. What's under extras? Disc copy 4.2. And floppy disc, oh floppy disc duplicator. I remember this stuff. Huh, yeah I guess that's all that's on here. Well we don't need that. We can abort mission. Let's get outta here. The funny thing is we do have Mac OS 7.6 installed on the Mystic hard drive. (computer beeping) Oh that was a sound. So yup, we'll have to go to plan B. I will need to get a 7.6 CD. I guess I could get an image just of the inter webs but I would feel better actually getting a CD. So I may have to hop around eBay. That is plan B, we'll do that next. Dun dun duh. Hey about one month later here we are. I now have a Mac OS 7.6 CD. It didn't take me very long to get it. There was just a lot of other things that came up. But now we can have some fun and install this. So. Hopefully this works. I have not installed 7.6 before. So this will be my first time. I am a Mac OS 7.6 virgin. If that's even a thing. Caddy is loaded, let's boot up the Mac TV. Power up. Oops (laughing) why do I always do this? I forget to turn the power on. Here we go, power up. In goes the caddy. Install Mac OS. That's what we're lookin' for. So hopefully this works better than the last CD. All right let's take a look. Installing Mac OS 7.6. Hey Cyberdog. I wonder if this has Cyberdog on it on the CD. I think it does. I've never used that before but I know of its existence. I don't really wanna read this. So we're just gonna pretend that this is all correct and it's gonna work. I'm actually curious what's in CD? Oh man America Online. Man I'm just getting like distracted by so many shiny objects. Oh Eric's solitaire sampler, pointer mode control. Lotta good stuff on here. Well let's install it. See if this works. I just want it to please. Mac OS, playing hopscotch. All right. Perform all steps below. Read important information. Well I think that's what we were just looking at but let's see what else this is. So an interesting thing is I believe there is a VHS tape that talked about all the new features in OS 7.6 and the demoer said that this document was, this was my favorite line. A consolidation of much information. I'm just like, it's like so poetic with the frickin' syllables and the rhymes like, but who says that? Who says consolidation of much information. (laughing) I don't know it's the small things in life that amuse me. - [Man] This document represents a consolidation of much information. - [Ken] Late breaking information yeah, from the nineties right? Okay well that's done. Update the hard disc driver. Let's take a look at that. We don't have an Apple hard drive in here though so I don't think that's necessary. You may skip this step if any of the following is true. You don't have an Apple computer. Oh yeah, clones right? You don't have any Apple disc drives attached from a computer. You have an Apple disc drive but it has been updated already. Oh with a non-Apple driver. Huh, I don't think there is an Apple hard drive in here but let's just see what it does when I hit continue? Drive selection failed. There we go. Then I think yeah I, is that counting the SCSI port. So external? Not internal? Is this only for updating external? Choose a disc for installation. Okay so this is the weird thing. Shit there's not enough free oh my gosh that's right. Shit. Yeah this disc is all partitioned weird. Yeah we need to get a, we need to open up like the disc utility thing or whatever. But we would need to be on an external system to make that work 'cause we can't reformat this partition table if we're booted off of it. Shoo all right I'm gonna be guessing a few things. If we can boot off the CD like a live CD mode sort of thing, we can use the Drive Setup utility, whatever it's called. From there. And redo the partition scheme. Well whatever I did I think it's working because I can hear the CD moving. Oh it just ejected it you asshole. That's so weird it let me select the CD from the startup drive option but it ejected the disc when I rebooted the computer. (sighing) 'Kay. And the other weird thing is. Yes this hard drive is split up into like four different partitions. But when you add them all together it's only like 40 megabytes of space. Which is really weird because I know this isn't the disc that came with the computer but the computer shipped with 160 megabyte hard drive so I don't know why whoever tinkered with this put a smaller disc in here. Maybe that's all they had I don't know. But it needs to be changed. Hang on. Okay I'm trying to reboot again while inserting the CD. Please do something. There we go. Now we know it's working because we have the, the smiley face. We didn't have that version of the smiley face earlier because system 7.1 didn't have that screen. I think this screen was introduced somewhere in the 7.5 releases and this is 7.6 so, which was the last major dot update released this system seven because then they went to OS 8. Hey check out that CD wallpaper, yeah. I got a mouse cursor movin'. Menu bar blank. Wallpaper. Nothing else is happening. Also what is this stuff on my screen? I've noticed it there before and every time I try scraping at it, it will not come off. I don't know what that is. I don't know how it got there. Frankly I don't even know how to get rid of it. I've scrubbed at it and I don't want to damage the glass or whatever material this is. Your clock is not set to the correct. Oh it hit okay before I even clicked anything. Okay. I wonder if we need to change that before we run the install. It's probably because the battery, the clock battery is all funky after you know, many years in storage or whatever. This computer is older than me. At least pretty sure it is. Okay so we're almost done. Yeah it's taken a little longer to load 'cause it's going off a CD. But it's gettin' there. Okay. I want to see what's in the disc images folder. It's probably all the installers. Oops don't need all these windows. Oh boy it's reopening my old windows. Don't do that, no. No how dare you make a mess of my desktop. Get outta here boys. Go away. Hey Cyberdog and there's MacLinkPlus. That's the translators for opening up different programs. Or different files made with different programs and yeah here's Mac OS 7.6. Yeah these are all the installers I would imagine. Yup dot image. Look at that floppy disc icon. Look at that has a nice icon. Utilities... duh I'm an idiot. There we go. Drive setup. You (beeping) kiddin' me dude? What? What do you mean drive setup cannot be launched on this computer? You asshole. Okay well that makes that a lot harder. All right what's this? Yeah okay. Well this makes everything a lot easier. Said no one ever. That's really bizarre. Okay shoo. Well I happen to know for a fact I was able to boot into that other Mac OS 7.6 CD now I don't think that CD will actually install properly on this hardware but it at least let me open up the drive set up if I'm not mistaken. So we're gonna boot into that. Actually I don't know if I can actually boot off of it. I just realized shit, I don't think it will boot. Oh I'm really yup, that's right. I didn't boot off of this. I booted off of something else. Okay well I have an external SCSI drive which has a Macintosh system on it which I could possibly use to repartition this hard drive. Might have to plug that sucker in. So a small change of plans. We're gonna have to plug in this external system. And hopefully it boots up. The old ClubMac drive is gonna save the day once again. So I have DB-25 and CN-50 on the SCSI cable here. CN-50 on the back. There is a terminator installed. I do appreciate all of you guys making sure I have a terminator installed. Yes I always have a terminator installed. And then DV-25 on the back of the TV. I have never plugged a SCSI device in to this Mac TV. So don't know if it's gonna work but, I'm assuming it will 'cause the board seems to be very healthy. 'Kay there's that. And then, our power. So let's flip on the disc and then boot up the TV. Disc here we go, power on. Here it goes, TV. Well I was a little worried for a second. It said welcome to Macintosh for about two minutes. And nothing else but now it's moving. I can hear the disk crankin' away so, hey I didn't even have to press any buttons. It just knew to boot externally. Pretty sweet, very smart old Macintosh. Well met fair Macintosh. Hopefully I can just open up the utility I need to reformat the disc. Okay it's gonna rebuild the desktop file first it looks like to get those other partitions mounted. Which ideally should be gone soon. They're not really necessary. It's just, it's actually making everything harder. I'm sure the original owner did something with them at one time but I don't like them. I want them gone. All right here's our Launcher. Yeah. And there it goes rebuild for number two, number three, number four. All right. Let's pop our CD in. Performa CD. So this obviously isn't a Performa, it's a Macintosh TV. But hopefully I can just open up this drive setup utility 'cause that's all I need from this CD. Then we can go back to the other CD which looked like it was workin'. You, you, oh I'm gonna punch somebody. I'm swear I had it open earlier. Oh man I really don't remember what I did earlier. I should check the tapes. What did I do earlier? I got something to open. Why don't I remember? I gotta find a way to format this disc somehow. I mean that's a useless error message. I wish it would tell me why it can't be launched. Is there a compatibility issue? Am I stupid? I dunno, it's just so generic. Useless error message. Well I checked the earlier part of the tech video log and what I was looking for was the At Ease interface to see if I can maybe do anything with that. And it dawned on me. Duh. I have another CD that I could use. But then came the sad realization. It got (beeping) cracked. The guards were down here recently reorganizing some shit. I bet they cracked that. 'Cause that was not cracked earlier. You are all witnesses. The CD worked just fine. Son of a bitch. Okay I just wanted to get this Mac TV updated to 7.6. But this is becoming a really cumbersome process. Just because whoever had this disc, this hard drive earlier, like just partitioned it up. And there's not even anything on the partition so like now I can't do the installation 'cause I have no space. Oh, this is really frustrating. Oh my gosh guys. Oh scotch. Scotch, scotch, scotch. The shit? Why are you doing this now? Oh. Shoot I know why. It's trying to connect to that SCSI disc 'cause I have it turned off but it's still plugged in. I don't know, I don't know of any other like dignified way to shut it down except to do a hard shut down. With the switch on the back 'cause I don't think you can use the button. Yeah I don't think there's any way to invoke like a soft shut down at this point. So power switch it is. Yoink, all right. SCSI. The external SCSI disc has been unplugged. Reboot. (clicking) (sighing) And now it won't turn on. I'm having a bad day. Let's try a good old fashioned power cycle. Sounds like a fitness program or some shit but tell you what no it's not. No it is not. Huh that's interesting I'm not hearing the same buzz I usually hear when I turn this thing on. Oh you freaking kidding me dude? Crazy ass mother trucker. Oh I'm gonna cry. Yeah oh shit I know sometimes these old boards have capacitor issues but shit, this one was working just fine. Why is every video log a rabbit hole of bullshit? Oh you think this would've been so (beeping) simple. This won't load on that. This won't load on that. This won't load on that. Now that CD is cracked. Can't use that. Can't even turn on the (beeping) computer now. (gradual, psychotic laughing) Oh man. I'm gonna lose it. I'm gonna lose it. And I've already lost so much I'm gonna lose even more. Well I officially don't know what to do now. Maybe I just let it sit plugged in for a little bit just like the issue I was having with the Color Classic, it wouldn't turn on right away but if you leave it plugged in for a while it then turns on. So maybe I just gotta do that. Oh really not looking to that one. I do have a Mystic board. But I would rather use the original board that came with this computer 'cause it has all the TV functionality. The Mystic board does not. It won't even turn on now. Oh boy guys, I think this one's really (beeping) up right now. I may have to come back to this. This was my favorite Mac. This is my favorite Mac that I have and it's kinda rare and now it won't even turn on. All I wanted to do was update the operating system huh? Yeah, yeah see, don't like software updates. Even back then they caused nothin' but problems. Well this one's gonna be written down as a loss in the book for now but all right, we'll have to come back to this one later. I'm sorry guys. I mean if you have any suggestions let me know. I'm totally open to your help. Catch the crazy and pass it on. (electronic music)",

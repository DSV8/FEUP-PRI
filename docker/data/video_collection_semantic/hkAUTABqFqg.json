    "transcript": "- Jenna? - Hello? - What's up? - Oh my gosh! - You guys. - Oh, wow! - There's a lot of stuff happening today. Today, we were gonna shoot a video and then I was like, \"Tyler, we need to just redo everything.\" We basically ripped the entire shooting room apart. We're making different sections. We now have a podcast section. - [Tyler] Wait. - He says wait. - [Tyler] So sorry. (instrumental music) - He says wait. - [Tyler] The eye light. - Hold on we have an eye light, this is new. Look at it. We're working out all the kinks here, but I'm very excited to show you guys what we actually did today. This is something that we've been waiting for. This is the RODECaster with all of the accessories for our podcasting. We are officially podcasters now. Because before we were borrowing the equipment. - And it's gonna be good, 'cause we're not gonna have to keep setting it up, taking it down, setting it up, taking it down. This is gonna be way better for efficiency as well as our mental health. - Yes, because it took so long to setup everything. We'll show you guys here in a second and basically. - So this is like my unboxing area that we basically swing this light around, and then we're ready and set for podcasting. - Again, thank you to Rode for hooking us up. They got us all set up to be actual professional podcasters. Let's start with the actual RODECaster itself. - Okay. - Okay. I'm gonna make us some room. (clunking) - There's so many goodies. - I love our new setup. I'm so hyped about it. Look how cool the set looks. We've got all kinds of cool stuff back there, guys. (upbeat music) This is extremely exciting. - One of my favorite things about podcasting is pushing the buttons on the RODECaster Pro. - And since this is ours now, we can set those up to be whatever we want. We can have our own sounds. (upbeat music) So this is the whole system and each one of these are the various inputs. So you can also have this plugged into your computer, which is really cool, because when we were doing virtual guests, (clunking) we're able to hear them through here, through the computer and you guys can also hear them. There's also a Bluetooth connection. So we're able to Bluetooth in from our phones and there's four different inputs that you can input back here. Do XLR. And these are the buttons that Jenna loves. - You like them too. - Okay yeah, but you're like super into them. (chuckles) - So you can add like custom sounds, or if you guys have listened to our podcast before we have like the clapping. It's like, \"Yes!\" (clapping) This other sound is like, \"Wuuh!\" The sexy sound. - So it does have a micro SD card, which is really cool because you don't need a computer. You can record directly here. This is your entire podcast Setup. Is here and you need nothing else except the microphones, of course. But you don't need a computer to record. - That's really good. - Everything goes directly- - Convenient. It has this big record button, which is red when it's recording. - Yep. Green when it's not. There's more. - There's a lot more. - There's a lot more. - Okay. - Let's open up the microphones next. These are the Broadcast Quality Dynamic Microphone called \"Procaster.\" Do you know why? Because we're pro-casters. - Casters. - And the audio is incredible. So these are super exciting. (rustling) - It comes with this very nice little baggy. - Oh, a sticker. - I love that we're opening at the same time. (rattling) (chuckles) - What a nice little travel bag. - This is very nice. It's a heavy dude. Okay. Okay, microphone check. (clipping) - We definitely need chalk 'cause we're always just- - Writing the table. (banging) - Always hitting the table. - This looks like the cup holder (rustling) that we have on our Super73 bikes. - This is nice. Oh, this is very heavy duty quality. Nice quality. (clinking) - Oh my God! - Oh my gosh! (bang) - Look how sturdy my yerba is. - Do you think that we can use the extras in the meantime as a- - This is an incredible cup holder. (banging) (kinking) - Careful, please. - Okay, yeah that's spin. - Oh, we can. Oh- - It's spring loaded. - Spring loaded, all right. - I already opened one and set it at our desks 'cause I wanted to just make sure that it was gonna work with the desk that we have over there. We can just use this. So this will just clamp right on the desk. (clinking) - Caution. - There it is. (rustling) Spring loaded people. - Spring loaded. - Super springy. - Hello spring loaded. - There it is. Look at that, it's bending. This is a good workout. I'm shredded after three pumps. (laughing) - That's great. - Err! So I think we have everything unboxed. Now let's go set up our podcasting desk. So we're basically gonna just take the shot and we're just gonna be like, \"Whoop!\" Are they able to see in there? Will it go over there? Will they see where they're gonna be? - That's where you guys- - [Tyler] Oh, yeah. - Look at that, that's where you guys are gonna be. (upbeat music) - So this is the podcast set up. The whole idea for this room was to make it so that we have several different sets. My goal was to keep everything as confined as possible. So this is what we've got, the podcast that is here and the way that Tyler was able to configure this light. It's great because we just have to let a little bit of maneuvering and then we just can swing this right over like this, and guess what we are set for our second set. We might add a top-down here. We also set up an option for a top-down station, right over here as well. So we have this little light here. This is like a little eye-lights and it's so small. It's a smaller, newer version of those big tube lights that we have back there at the back. Speaking of the back. So this is also a shelf that I had actually downstairs in my kitchen. And I just put a few of my favorite things, some of my favorite books. And this is actually from John when we did an unboxing of this, that was a while ago. And this is an original 1984 Mac that I also did an unboxing of but actually forgot about it. I never posted the unboxing. Do you remember that? That was a while ago. That was like last year. - [Tyler] Oops! - So that's the room so far. This is kind of version, I don't know, 45 at this point. But I feel like this is version one of this new room set up. Tyler also, did we talk about that before that you blacked-out the windows with garbage bags? - [Tyler] No. - I don't think we did talk about that. I was like, \"Let's black these out.\" But look at this, you did such a good job. The reason we did this is because we can now completely control the lighting 'cause we would be shooting at all times of the day. And then when we were shooting after the sun went down, We were like, \"Man it looks really great in here.\" We now have controlled lighting, and I also have somebody coming to paint this wall. I think I'm gonna do. I don't know if I should do a dark gray or just go for the black. I have to decide. I gotta decide 'cause they're going tomorrow. Stay tuned. (upbeat music) - Jenna? - Hello? - No, close your eyes. (beep) Okay, Jenna, get ready. - All right. - I've kept you blindfolded for the past two weeks. (giggling) You haven't seen the new podcast set. - Nope. - Open them. - Oh my gosh! - Wow! - It looks so good. The lighting looks incredible. The table, the microphone, the wall. Oh my God, it's so nice. She's already seen it. We've already shot two episodes here. (crowd cheering) But this is the set. - The reveal. - You've already seen it, but I love it. I love the look. I think it looks incredible. I'm super hyped. But yeah, if you guys wanna check out the podcast, you can check it out at anchor.fm/samebrain. We also now have an Instagram and Twitter. We've had it for a while, we just haven't updated it. - We're using Twitter now. - But that wasn't really updated. We have a YouTube channel. So I'll put all the links in the description. You guys wanna check that out, but the new set looks great. And now all we have to do is figure out how to streamline this process to make it a little bit quicker. - Good luck with that. See you later. - Bye. - We're gonna need a new bench. - Yeah, this sucks. - Like, this hurts my butt. - This is terrible - My but is not comfortable. - We're sitting on a bench and it's not good. And it's Rocky, so I'm like, \"Meh!\" - My butt hurts. - Okay, cool. Bye. See you later. (recording playing) No. (crowd cheering) - My butt. - Delete everything. (upbeat music)",

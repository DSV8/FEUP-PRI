    "transcript": "what's up with people our first meeting for CES is going to be a little bit early we are going to razor yeah the three musketeers are landed we are back again alright good people so at the razor suite we have the razor tomahawk elite their first case that they've designed by themselves this is just a prototype it looks sick let's check it out but first the huge thanks to our sponsors for making this see as possible alright so this whole razor tomahawk case is a very interesting direction for razor because it's the first case that they're designing by themselves you know they've done some collaborations with the NZXT and other brands in the past which looks you know look they look cool but this is legit their first case of course it has you know a lot of resemblance in this current state to NZXT the H series like the H700 it's about the same size and has the same kind of like metallic shape the ventilation pattern for example is the same square so I'm really hoping that in the final revision that we'll see some unique elements in terms of design that you know separates this case from many other cases in the market and NZXT in particular so the tomahawk elite what's so special about it so what they're trying to do is go into the direction with these mechanized side panels so they're both tempered glass on both sides and they are supposed to raise up so the prototype sample we saw is just you know it's a handmade sample but what they want to do here is you press a button they open up but they're also inserting in this top panel which is also tempered glass so it's a three side tempered glass design and letting you raise that a little bit for airflow so my question in terms of this interior layout was because it is inverted you know you'll need definitely fan brackets up top otherwise you know this whole raising section up top will be pointless I really like the power supply shroud design it is all enclosed and they're still debating on whether or not to put anything in the front and I feel like they should because if it's just a front solid piece then the case is you know is going to limit its airflow potential if the whole basement is covered with the power supply shroud and the top has no fan bracket so where you know you know install fans so the rear has some an allocation of course it's not final yet and so I'm really kind of excited to see how and in what direction race it will take this tomahawk Elite what I really like about the cable management design I'm not sure exactly how it will be in the finished product but I love the motherboard sort of cover at the back so this is where you can hide certain cables routing them for your 24 pin and the eight pin cable while having that little transparent section so you can see the motherboard cutout which i think is a you know a very unique take on paneling design especially since that whole area is tempered glass side panels so it will be visible throughout I do like the SSD mounting locations however the SATA cables are facing towards the front and not towards the motherboard tray so exactly how you're going to route that so cable measurement still needs a bit of work especially on how to access the power supply shroud area of course the top i/o will include type-c connector and I'm hoping you know nice collection of buttons so you can control the top hydraulic system for airflow and those side panels pricing is not yet available but I'm really excited to see in what direction Razer takes the Tomahawks series and just really looking forward to the final production samples and this is the Razer tomahawk a slightly more basic version compared to the tomahawk Elite this one is a little bit more complete state so let's check it out and as for the lower end razor tomahawks so that's in a more complete state so the tooling is almost complete and it does have three resembles to a lien the Alpha enclosure so a similar kind of roomy interior power supply shroud with those covers on to which you can install either fans or SSDs you can install a 360 radiator at the front but my only concern is with the top mounted fans since those fan holes are not lined up for flexibility for radiators for example because they are fixed and that's an issue illumination of course though it looks awesome bottom firing LEDs plus the Razer logo at the front it kind of Falls and what Razer has been doing with NZXT that designed by Razer formula but now the tomahawk is razors own creation all right so that's the Razer tomahawk elite and the regular tomahawk what think any feedback is of course appreciated this is going to be launching in q3 of 2019 so lots of time for revisions and you know market trends to catch up hopefully we'll see many new features as well that are not included in this prototype so thanks so much for watching the CES coverage I'll see you guys next video",

    "transcript": "- Today, we have a mouse for you. This is from Xtrfy, and I don't have a knife. So, I'm just gonna use this bracket I found in the camera den. No, it's horrible. There we go. - [Man] You are hurting the box! - That is a lot of mice. We got the Retro-ness color. It's kinda... - [Man] Shoddy! (laughs) - You wish. I call dibs. This is real special. Custom LTT Orange Edition. (laughs) Okay, why don't we get all this other stuff out of the way? Nothing fancy in the box, but there seems to be some key caps. So that's kinda neat. Best I can tell, these are shine through. Got a GG key cap. That'd be good if you've got macros for GG. The mouse itself, right off the hop, it's light in the hand. The Glorious O is what I am gonna compare this to, and it has like a baggy cable sheath which I find a little weird. So even with pan this one is 66 grams which it's rated at 68 I believe. Let's see how it feels like creak wise. Little bit of creaking, but relatively solid. I like the round holes, compared to having a hexagon hole like most other ergo gaming mice like this have. Huh. It's really hard to see there, might have to get a close up, but that says \"good luck have fun, GLHF\", cute. The scroll is, not mushy but a little muted. It's hard to explain, a roller ball feel, but it's fine, I wish it was a little more tactile. This has Omron switches in it. 20 million click rated. This sounds nice. A little sensitive for my liking. I run a Rival 300 at home. Definitely a longer throw on my Rival, than this guy. I brought a friend. The Glorious O. See how the cable's kinda baggy. In reading reviews of this mouse, I haven't used it too much personally, that's what fails all the time. I wanna see this retro mouse. Ooh, this appeals to me greatly. Yes, I like how the strain reliefs , in the cable the inductive choker, all color matched. A little attention to detail that I can appreciate. So for weight, the Glorious O is 2 grams lighter, than the Xtrfy M4. Does it feel it? You can't tell, let's be honest. It has those hexagon holes that I was talking about, but they're very similar. You can definitely tell the M4 is more ergo. It's got a wider base to it. And generally in the hand, this flare out on the back edge, it feels like my hand just drops off this mouse. These holes on the side, add a lot of texture and grip, something that I personally find I ware away, anything in this zone. After about 6 months of using any mouse, it just gets worn, and looks horrible but having the raw plastic and have a little bit of hard texture is really nice. - [James] How big are your hands? - How big are my hands? (beep) My hands are rather large compared to most. Glorious O slides really nicely. And it's very minor, but I think this has a little more resistance. See how much farther the Glorious O slides? - [David] It's not as the box made it seem though, (mumbles) - I don't know man. But look at the two tone. - [James] I like the two tone, I think this thing it needs like one more (mumbles) - I think the RGB is, RGB is probably throwing you out, you said that to Red, you'd be down. So I don't know if you can that inside, but there is a little lit up Xtrfy logo in there. So it's nice they just include a combos, you don't have to deal with any overhead software. That much I appreciate. Okay, why don't we give it a game sesh? Let's see how bad my foot shots are as little maker today. So compared to my mouse at home, the lightness is throwing me off a little. I am used to having to put more hand into it. Being able to control the movement with just my fingers is different. Usually there is a lot of wrist work in it. I haven't ever really tried a mouse this light. It's got a Pixart 3389 sensor, it's like their top tier sensor. There are couple below that are really similar, you'd be hard pressed to find a difference. The control board in here, is conformal coated. So if you're like me, and you have a beverage sitting beside you while you game, and you like to flick shot a little bit too hard and you end up with your beverage all over your mouse, or in my case my number pad on my Corsair keyboard, rest in peace, this should survive. For some people it might be a problem, but for me it certainly is. The button quality is there. The lightness is there. It's got some neat features. It's got the highest end sensor that I think you can get right now, or one of the highest. Comes in a bunch of cool colors. For a wired mouse, and coming in at $59, it's hard to beat. Like our comparator, where is it, the Model O, is $50 for Matte and $60 for Glossy. So we are in the same ballpark. If you want more of an ergo mouse, I would say pick the Xtrfy, I really like it, and I think the color options are just better, in my opinion. But that's just me. That's ShortCircuit. Get subscribed. Peace.",

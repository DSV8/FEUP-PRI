    "transcript": "these days $73 gets you like a couple of eggsand maybe some milk, if you're lucky or some alientechnology. all you need to do is some Craigslist knife battling. Granted these aliens do seem to have a fetish for mass-- producing to the lowest bidder and apparently burying their crap in the desert but how about learning to forge new Advanced skills using today's video sponsor brilliant with brilliant you learn through application be it lesson in math programming AI data analysis brilliant has it all if you're terrified of AI for example try brilliant's new how llms work course by getting Hands-On with real language models you'll see that maybe skynet's not so bad after all so start your daily journey to developing a new skill using the brilliant link down below for a three full 30 days and you'll also get 20% off an annual premium subscription [Music] [Music] now considering the specimen's advanced State of Decay combined with its apparent impact on the local ecosystem to avoid further contamination the application of valida gloves has been recommended before continuing the autopsy now the deposits along the top of this specimen seem to be a combination of terrestrial mold and just general debris implying the specimen's been abandoned on Earth for quite some [Music] time when lifting up these gills for either cooling or breathing purposes the EXT of the contamination starts to become clear on the front of the specimen below some form of tribal adornment is a latch which hides means of interfacing with the specimen below that is a slot which may act as some form of limited intake which is also heavily blocked with Dey around the back is more means of interface in interface which seems real archaic for something supposedly alien but to further the autopsy I think we're going to have to Viv act to the specimen when lifting up this Gill one can easily remove the side on the inside of this outer protective skin there are markings perhaps instructions for repair or a warning now aside from the initial outer protective layer there is another interior protective layer of low quality polyc carbons my God this is It's So Advanced I've not seen anything like it in this class before this must be some form of Apex [Music] specimen this dirty dirty boy has a GTX 690 in it which is a monster dual GPU Beast of a GPU I didn't know it was in here when I bought this system which is which is pretty cool nice surprise uh I also don't know what CPUs in here although going by the quad Channel Ram which is very unmodern Alienware of it it's some LGA 2011 CPU which is all very exciting but at this point I don't really know if it works or not the person who sold it to me said that they were pretty sure that it does so um yeah let's see what what happens let's try and turn it on now interestingly in terms of rear IO we don't have HDMI on this GTX 690 which is kind of crazy considering that I guess the graphics card's not that old but it does mean that we're going to have to use one of these adapters to be able to use it with a Modern Display okay well now comes the Moment of Truth we need to see if this dumpster baby turns on wait is that is that all that button does is that not the power button oh come on what oh I guess this is the power button but apparently that power button wasn't working for some reason which meant it took me quite some time to figure out how to turn on the Alienware but eventually once I re-plugged it in for the 18th time it just burst to life oh oh it's breathing there's also some lights on under here and look at that it posted I don't think they reinstalled Windows on this system before before selling it on is there a password there is a password though uh yeah I'm going to have to reinstall Windows on it because that's a bit of a whoopsy on the seller's part but while reinstalling Windows I realized this system still has a boot hard drive in it which is complete Madness but luckily after a very painful initial launch process the system blew screened and corrupted my new windows install oh that's not a great start this is not a happy system so I decided to replace the hard drive with an s SD wait but these caddies don't support an SSD so that's kind of annoying I guess I'm going to have to just push the SSD in there apparently the Alienware didn't mind me thumbing in a shorty cuz just like that we had windows installed on our brand new SSD oh W it's so much faster now it's crazy how much of a difference an SSD makes over a hard drive PSA if you have a hard drive in your system now that you're running Windows on don't stop watching the video run to a shop and buy an SSD yeah with that hard drive out the system feels a lot healthier I think it was on the verge of failing to be honest in fact I think it may have right at the end uh but anyway let's plug some internet into it so we can set it up and then we can see what CPU we've got okay so it's not nearly as baller as I thought it was but it's still a 3930k got six cores 12 threads here is oh it says we're just using three out of the four slots so slot one is either dead or just not fully seated so we'll check that out in a second and then we have our two GTX 690s but it it reads twice because it's a dual GPU GPU so I'm going to check the ram quickly and then we can try game on it it was a seating issue the ram worked [Music] fine okay well um that's not a great start but despite initially being a downer the game still launched fine it's get getting hot on the GPU pretty quickly we haven't even started playing yet and it's already hovering around ADC oh that's not going great 50 frames per second at 1080p medium settings is not an impressive result although we are just using one of our gpus so at this point we're essentially just gaming with a single underclocked GTX 680 that really is the problem with multi-gpu setups oh wow the game feels awful my word temperatures are also not doing great although maybe a repaste will help I'll give that a try a bit later cuz this system doesn't look like it was owned by a repter CS2 also mad about our presidential candidate aged graphics card very nice interestingly we have a teeny bit of utilization on the second GPU it's not a whole lot but there's kind of maybe something happening there we're also not fully utilizing the other graphics card or the CPU so I'm thinking we're maybe running into video memory issues here considering we just have 2 gigs of video memory per GPU but despite all that at 1080p low settings this is a usable result there's some definite fluctuations going on but I say this is kind of usable let's try some Fidelity FX that has not improved our frame rate it's just made the game look all Fidelity fxy okay cyber Punk is doing about as well as arm laptop gaming so that's I I I don't know which which of the two systems should be offended by that our graphics card is just continually getting hotter and hotter and again with cyber Punk the second GPU isn't doing anything so yeah the system is not holding up particularly well and this kind of thing is just such a good example of why dual GPU configurations aren't a thing anymore is because they're so driver dependent and then these companies have to keep uh keep supporting them stuff but maybe some balanced Fidelity effects can save us oh I mean we can tell by our mini map that game is happening for some reason Fidelity FX just breaks cyberpunk so I decided to shift over to a game that would still have driver optimization so we can use the full power of our 690 first I tried GTA 5 which just kept making the system crash I couldn't get the game to run but luckily shadow of the Tomb Raider worked hey we found a game look at that almost 100% utilization on both gpus at 1080p High settings we are crushing some some rise of the Tomb Raider here although it is feeling a little bit micro stuttery something which people complained about about dual GPU setups and yeah you can really feel the kind of inconsistent frame pacing it doesn't feel terrible but for the frame rate there's there's a bit of a stutter but with the two gpus running at full power we can witness this system in all its Majesty lots of power Happening Here lots of heat as well now that the second GPU is doing stuff the first one has crossed crossed the 90 threshold oh oops and then it crashes oh no I died so hard the system crashed which was my cue to perform some surgery after preliminary tests the subject is responsive yet clearly unwell I think we're going to have to try and do some surgical intervention although considering the advanced State of Decay I'm not sure how much we can do for [Music] it my God is drier than I [Music] imagined it's so dense [Music] some of the specimen's internals seem in surprisingly good condition although an attempted further investigation will be made as with the previous part there's a buildup of dry material which could be impeding its performance so let's replace it and see what happens [Music] but the initial Booth after the surgery didn't go well the fan on the aiio ramped up to full speed and then the system crashed after which the system would barely survive the post screen oh it is still wildly unhappy let me reset the seos again and see replacing the massive corroded seos battery did nothing and despite the ai's massive exertion the CPU kept overheating the aiio had very little liquid left in it and I think while cleaning it an air bubble moved from the radiator into the pump preventing any heat exchange from happening because replacing the aiio fixed the problem okay there we go it's working perfectly fine now okay well temperatures all around are better I mean it makes sense that the the CPU temps are better we have a functional AO on it now and it's a 280 as opposed to a 120 mil the GPU on the other hand is better but we just started gaming so let's let's give it some time and see where it goes a few moments later okay never mind it still runs hot as hell I guess this is just a fiery graphics card which brings me to the end of the video thank you for watching subscribe to the channel if you like the video Don't if you didn't and yeah until the next video bye-bye [Music] [Applause] [Music]",

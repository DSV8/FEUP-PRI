    "transcript": "for today's video we're going to test some marketing claims of sellers on amazon we're going to see if for 280 you can buy a legitimate 4k gaming pc and then at the same time we're going to see if pigs can fly and if hell has frozen over and then finally at the end of the video i'm gonna see if i can get the thing to do the thing it was meant to do in the first place by adding a waifu [Music] and here is the little 4k gaming piece of crap that actually took surprisingly quick to ship considering the fact that i live in canada and bought this off amazon us i guess it's a good sign that it's a microsoft authorized refurbished although i wonder if microsoft realized that this was a 4k gaming system when they actually did the refurbish but we'll we'll benchmark it naturally at 4k later on in the video to test those illustrious claims so let's do a quick unboxing here and see what this 4k gaming system looks like oops okay let's see what it looks like in here uh we do actually get some peripherals that's always exciting i love getting e-waste with my with my 4k gaming system here's a mouse as well and then we have a user manual also with a bunch of microsoft branding on it it seems like the base system is by hp and as we all know hp is famous for their 4k gaming capable line of office pcs so let's just take this out and have a closer look at it ah there we go the 4k gaming system in all its glory look at this beauty now for those of you that are still struggling to see through my quite frankly awful sarcasm this clearly isn't a 4k gaming system the seller was lying this is the kind of office pc that you'd see in like an office a school computer lab or like a library or whatever i don't actually know what specs are in here they just have really vague language like core i5 and that's about it in in the actual sellers post so we're going to find out together i mean it's got a usable front i o you've actually got four usb ports which is which is great the rear i o also helps date the system somewhat we've got two ps2 ports which is which is pretty cute and then we've got a vga port and an uh port it does have a display port though which is pretty cool and four usb3 and then when you get down to the display outputs again it's not really looking like a 4k gaming capable system here so the seller i think through the graphics card in here is like a separate edition so yeah i honestly i'm not even sure if this actually outputs a 4k signal but we'll have a look at that later with that let's open it up um okay it wasn't even screwed down but i guess that's fine oh just on a quick side note it's so staticky in winter in canada that i actually have a grounding point which is very unusual for me but let's move over to the innards of this beautiful 4k system uh the graphics card you may recognize uh it's not quite what you think it is it's actually a gt 730 so not quite the gt710 that it looks like it's it's bigger brother i think i'm not quite sure how their performance relates to each other but you know we'll see how it performs a bit later under here we have an i5 that's the extent to which they give us information about it as far as the ram goes it looks like we've got ddr3 in there which also helps date the system a lot this is not gonna be a new i5 that it has in here and then we've got the uh optical drive here and then this is the power supply can we lift this up oh yeah there we go that just flips out like that oh we've got a one terabyte hard drive that's pretty fancy let's have a look what it says about this power supply so the power supply is actually a 240 watt unit let's see can you take this little sliding door thing off that oh it's stuck on the cables maybe okay there we go and then we've got two okay hopefully it'll and then under that we have an intake fan and um nothing else i don't really know what i was expecting to see back here to be honest this duct is such a pain in the butt to get back on it's clearly important though there's so much power in the system that you know i don't want to mess with the airflow characteristics at all but okay there we go honestly when it comes to the rest of the insides there's not much else to say this is a very boring looking pc that looks like it dreams in excel spreadsheets so yeah let's close it up hook it up to a 4k monitor and see what kind of gaming performance we get and we also want to figure out what cpu it has in it [Music] [Music] yay finally we're in that took way longer than it should have um but now we can actually have a look at what's going on on this system as far as bloatware goes there's nothing on here it seems this is just like a fresh vanilla install of windows now is a good time to check what cpu this system actually has in it an i5 3470 okay it could have been worse and then we have eight gigs of ram running at 1600 megahertz so it's ddr3 and then we have the gt 730 og i don't think it's an og anything but that is what's hopefully going to get us some good 4k gaming performance okay so the max we can output at the moment is 1080p that may be because we don't have graphics card drivers though so let's see if we can even get a 4k signal out of this gpu after what feels like a lifetime of struggling i still haven't gotten a 4k signal out of this 4k gaming system in fact i couldn't even install graphics card drivers on it i struggled for ages and eventually just gave up and reinstalled windows on it so now i've got graphics card drivers on here but still no 4k signal out of it but there may be a very simple fix to that problem 3840 by 2160 and then it's gonna be 30 hertz yay okay yes so that works we can we can make a custom resolution okay so we have a 4k signal coming out of the 4k gaming system now that we have the world's worst 4k signal coming out of the system let's see what the gaming experience is like there are a lot of visual artifacts going on and we're off to a flying start this is a perfectly playable gaming experience right i think i think the thing that gets me the most about it is the tearing yeah we're sitting at eight frames per second but just just look at the daring after cs go i decided to try something a little bit easier to run half-life 2. and as you can see here we're sitting between like 40 and 60 frames per second which is actually not that bad but don't be too impressed by that because it is half-life 2 a game that can comfortably run on a pacemaker and then there's the problem of that 30 hertz signal which oh it just feels so terrible you can see there's still really bad tearing and it's just such a bad gaming experience so obviously that didn't go very well but did we expect it to actually be able to offer a playable gaming experience at 4k i mean the seller was just straight up lying if this system is a 4k gaming pc then i am a victoria secret model but can we turn it into a 4k gaming capable system by making some minor tweaks and maybe adding a waifu now as you can see inside this hp office pc it is very cramped and there's no way that we're gonna fit this huge waifu card in here so we're gonna have to use this pci express extender so that we can actually just leave the graphics card outside of the case and i'm gonna have to use like an external power supply for the graphics card because we only have a 240 watt power supply in here and it uses kind of proprietary connection sizes so we can't just use a normal power supply so i'm gonna have to be a bit ghetto about that as well i don't know about you but that seems perfectly safe to me we've just got a graphics card lying kind of on top of the system there and then we've got this power supply which is going to be providing the pci express power for the waifu card um i'm just gonna trip the power on on this bad boy and then hopefully it's not gonna set the world on fire but this may be a functioning 4k gaming system now i've actually not done any prior research to see whether or not this is actually a safe way to run a gpu but my instinct tells me it's going to be fine and my instinct is usually very accurate with this kind of thing it's four and five right oh it's not on okay so it's clearly it's clearly sending power to the gpus so that's a good sign i love that like nail cutting scissors are the best way that i have to do this but okay so we've got lights on here and now let's do that that sounds normal it it makes that tractor starting noise every time you press the power button that's not unusual oh look at that we've got a signal out of it now whether or not this gpu actually has enough power available to it to actually game is a different story but look at that and just like that we're running at 4k 60 hertz with a 5700 xt in that system so it's working weirdly let's actually see uh ram wise what's happening as well uh performance yes we do have 16 gigs of ram running at 1600 megahertz and there is our rx 5700 xd so let's see if we can do some 4k gaming with an actual modern game look at that we've got like 200 plus fps i mean it is an rx 5700 xt running cs go so yeah i mean it's not like this is a very demanding use case but still we're gaming in 4k with the 4k gaming pc and some some minor tweaks we've got battlefield 5 running this is at a high preset and we've got about 80 frames per second what i find pretty hilarious about all of this is that even at 4k the cpu is a bottleneck in this game uh with a 5700 xt but still this is uh very playable okay yeah so we can now run battlefield 5 at 4k which is pretty impressive but can a lame overused meme at 4k there's no way you didn't see this coming of course i had to do like the lamest meme in the books at this point but yeah um crisis isn't running very well at 4k although that's not necessarily the system's fault considering that the crisis remaster looks more like a desperate cry for help to me than a genuine concerted effort to make a well-optimized reboot [Music] you",

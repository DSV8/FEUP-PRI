Use Kron and archive to back up configs to TFTP, FTP or SCP servers. Don't try to do everything manually. Automate it! Just like cron in Linux, you can use kron on Cisco IOS to schedule things. Schedule backups, schedule TCL scripts and much more.  Amaze others with your knowledge of the Cisco IOS. You don't need python for these scripts. Rock that job interview and show senior network engineers what you can do. Keep on learning and change your life. Get that good paying job by showing your skills.

    "transcript": "- Okay snake, we don't need you. I don't mind Python as in the programming language but I don't particularly like snakes. You can watch this video as an example where I had an encounter with a black mamba in Africa. When that snakes bites you you've got about 30 minutes to live or 60 minutes and then you're dead. (dramatic music) So fortunately nothing happened but it was a very close encounter. In this video I'm gonna show you how to back up iOS configurations, I'm gonna show you two methods to do that. The first method is using kron which is very similar to cron on Linux. It basically allows you to schedule things so we're gonna schedule automated backups of Cisco routers and switches. You can back up the configurations you can do other things. In a previous video which I've linked here I showed you how to use Tcl scripts to do things. But you can use kron to schedule Tcl scripts. The second method is to use archiving. Both these methods have been available in the Cisco iOS for a while. I don't meed Mr. Python here because we're not gonna be using Python. In other videos I have shown you how to use Python to back up configurations so have a look at this video if you're interested in doing that, I'll also create some updated videos because my Python videos on YouTube are quite old at this point. But again, kron has been available in the Cisco iOS for a while. As you can see here it's been available since 12.2 on some versions of iOS so it's been available for a while. Archiving provides you with many features it's also been available on the Cisco iOS for a while. So as you can see here 12.2, 12.3. It's also available in Cisco XE. Okay as always because this is YouTube I need to ask you please subscribe to my YouTube channel, please like this video if you find it useful and please click on the bell to get notifications when I post a new video. Okay so I've spoken enough now let's get started. I'm using a GNS3 topology here. I've got three Cisco routers these are just traditional Cisco routers. In my example in router two, show version, notice we're using VIOS version 15.6(2)T. So this is just standard Cisco iOS it's not XE. I've also got a Ubuntu server here. This server is actually the toolbox server available in GNS3. And what's nice about this docker containing GNS3 is we have tftp. So if I go to the tftpboot directory there are a bunch of files already here but what I'll do is I'll remove all the files in this directory. So ls now shows us that there are no directories in this tftpboot directory. No files currently exist in this directory. But what's nice about this docker container is that it runs a tftp server. Now if you've got a Windows PC you could use different tftp servers. You could use SolarWinds which is a free tftp server and I've linked that below or you could use TFTPD32 as an example or 64 if you prefer. There are multiple tftp server options available for free so you don't have to pay for a tftp server today. Okay so this Ubuntu host has a IP address of 10.1.3.2. That's the address that were gonna back up configs to. Now on router two, that's the router here in our topology, you could do this on multiple routers but I'll just do this on router two. I'm gonna use the command kron, so K-R-O-N in this example. I need to specify a policy list and an occurrence. So basically what are we gonna do and how often are we gonna run the V commands? Okay so kron, let's say policy list, give it a name, so let's say backupconfig, whatever name you like so just give it some kinda name. And then what we're gonna do is run a cli command. And in this example I'm gonna type show run pipe, redirect tftp and again you could use sep or something else if you want. The Ubuntu host has this IP address once again, so 10.1.3.2 so I'll paste that in. And give it a name, let's say r2-shrun.cfg. So that's the file name where we're gonna save the configuration. Okay kron occurrence, so give it a name, let's say backup every minute, whatever you wanna use. Notice here we have two options, in, how often are we gonna run this? So in one minute in my example. Or at a specific time. So I'm gonna say in one minute. We can specify minute or hour, minutes or days, hours and minutes so in one minute recurring. What I'm gonna do is run the policy list of backupconfig. So scrolling up that's the policy that we created, backupconfig. So that's the one that we're gonna run. Okay so end and that's all you need to do really. So show kron schedule shows us that our backup will run in 38 seconds, 35 seconds, 34 seconds. Going back onto the tftp server notice we don't have a configuration on the tftp server because it's gonna run in 23 seconds. Before that runs let's do a debug so debug kron all so that we can see what's going on. Show kron schedule once again 14 seconds to go, no config on the tftp server. Nine seconds, seven seconds, sorry about this delay, I'll speed this up if you like in future. Now one of the things I want you to see is notice before it ran it was inactive but as soon as it ran it became active, so it's active while it's running. And you can see here this is what happened. The command was called show run redirect config to the tftp server so that command has run, it'll run again in 56 seconds or 16 seconds in this example. Notice the config is there if I type more r2 config notice there is the running configuration of my router. It's been backed up to the tftp server. It's actually just run again. So the config has been backed up once again. So I could remove this or in this example let's just move it to r2 v1 config. So ls now shows us that we've got the old config here. When this runs again in 31 seconds we'll get the new configuration on the tftp server. Now one of the questions people often ask is okay, how do I get a timestamp? And I'll show you that using the archive method. Okay so it's just run, ls again, notice there's our configuration. So once again more r2 cfg, there's our running configuration backed up to the tftp server. Okay so that's the first method kron. You can get this to do many types of things. They've got some examples on the Cisco website you can find a lot of examples of this online as well. You can get it to run Tcl/Tk scripts you can get it do all kinds of things. It's basically a scheduler just like you have in Unix or Linux. Okay next one is archiving. Okay archiving allows you to do a lot more than just back up configs. You can restore configurations, you can have a history of configurations. Very nice feature available on Cisco iOS. So global config mode archive. What option are we gonna use? We're gonna use log config. So we're gonna log our configuration. And actually you can see here kron has just run so what I'll do actually is turn off the debug. So do un all. Basically disable debugging. That's not part of the archive command so just that it doesn't get confusing I'll do that again. I typed archive and then I typed log config, pressed enter and now what I'm gonna do here is enable logging. So logging enable. I'm gonna hidekeys which basically suppresses output e.g. passwords when displaying logged commands. We don't particularly want our passwords displayed so hidekeys. Next step is exit and what we wanna do here is specify a path. Notice the options there are many options here, we could use flash, so write the configurations to the flash or the router. We can send it to a tftp server, we can send it to a secure copy server. But in our example I'm simply gonna use tftp. So tftp, forward slash, forward slash, IP address of the tftp server is this so 10.1.3.2. And what I'm gonna do here is specify a date. So notice dollar h hyphen or dash. What I also wanna do is backup the configuration whenever the configuration is saved. So as soon as I save the configuration I wanna write it to the archive. You could also specify time period. Now typically you don't wanna do it as I'm doing it here, one minute. You might use a value like this which is once a week. But in my example I'm just gonna specify one minute because I want it to backup continuously. Now to show archive, this is the most recent configuration. So it's actually backed it up already to the tftp server. Show clock, notice the date, 12 September, the time, 11:49:58 so this got backed up at 32. That is the most recent configuration and that's what I'm seeing here. Now I'll clear the screen ls dash l. Notice we can see another configuration has been backed up. So we now have two configurations on the tftp server. And if I tap show archive on the router notice we can see Most Recent configuration is there. Okay so let's do that again. As soon as I type wr, so write my configuration and then type show archive, notice an archive was made. Back on the Ubuntu server there's our newest archive. Show archive, write the configuration. Show archive, this is the Most Recent one now. Back on the tftp server originally we had two now we've got three and it's actually done another archive because I'm making an archive every minute. So copy run start. Save the configuration back on the tftp server. Notice we've got another backup of configuration. Okay so that was fairly simple. I've shown you how to archive the router's configuration. And pointed to a tftp path. It's gonna run every minute in my example now that's probably way too much. But just for this demonstration, that works. It's also gonna archive the configuration when I save the configuration. Show archive, notice we can have up to 10 displayed here on the router. So what I'll do is I'll simply do a bunch more. So do another one. Notice we're at nine as a number here. Do another one. Show archive, notice 10 is the Most Recent. Notice we lost zero there. Save that again. Notice we're at 11, we lost one. But those configs still exist on my tftp server. So there's the original config notice we're all the way to 11. So these are two great ways to automate the backup of router configurations. Once again, show run. I'll use forward slash here to search for archive. There's our archive configuration. And as always I'll put this below the video. And here is the kron configuration. Now with kron one thing I forgot to show you is the at option. So I'll just paste that configuration in here. Notice with kron you can get it to run at a certain time. So notice at 11 p.m. Sunday reoccurring. And the policy that's gonna run is this one. So show run forward slash kron. I've got it running every minute probably wanna remove that. And then I've got it running every Sunday evening. The issue here is it's gonna overwrite the config on the tftp server, archiving makes this a lot easier. Very simple configuration to archive your config to a tftp server or ftp server or secure copy server every week, every minute, whatever you decide to do. Okay so hopefully you found this video useful. If you have, please would you like it, please would you subscribe to my YouTube channel.

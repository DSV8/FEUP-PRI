    "transcript": "say what you will about NSI but they do crack out obscene pre-builts that are frankly impressive rate and MSI doesn't let boring things like practicality thermal limits or copyright law get in the way of their eccentric experimentation and today's system is no different so let's check it out today's video is sponsored by the Deep cool AK lineup of coolers a collection including the ak-620 ak-500 and AK-47 different shapes and sizes that fit in many budgets and use cases I've been using the ak-620 in my main system now for ages and not only does it look great it also works very well and if you don't like the standard silver you can also get them in Zero Dark if any of these deep cool coolers have peaked your interest check them out using the link in the description below thanks deepcool for sponsoring today's video [Music] thank you now I was made aware of this MSI system on eBay by a patreon who also happens to have a tech YouTube channel which I'll have Linked In the description below and not only that but they also contributed a considerable amount of the asking price of this system so thank you very much Carrie I really appreciate that and with that let's check out the system [Music] oh yes eBay Packaging oh this is actually it you know I'd say it's about as haphazardly packaged as you'd expect but it seems fine but other than the system we have a power cable and that's about it cool [Music] oh it's so gross oh there seems to be bear stuck in what I can only imagine to be bot juices on it okay well I've given it a minute and made peace with the fact that we did buy it off eBay so pubes are kind of a given but putting that aside look at it it's like a like an MSI version of a trash can Mac which apparently comes with an i7 in it it even seems to have the same thermal design of having like a top fan that pulls air with the help of convection through the case which is pretty exciting except the top vents on this one are all angular and gamery also dirty and then back here underneath the dragon which the Mac Pro disappointingly doesn't have we've got pretty good rear i o we've got a bunch of USB ports and even dual gigabit Ethernet and down here next to the Pew we've got two USB C and two display ports and finally on the system's undercarriage we've got a bunch of ventilation and this little knob is where you plug the power cable in now I'm hoping that bit isn't the entire power supply but we'll figure that out once we open up the system but on that note I just want to power up the system and make sure it works before I potentially break it during the teardown because I can't imagine this is going to be easy to take apart anyway let's quickly do that ew oh it's so sticky do you know what do you know what I need here not valida because apparently I lost my velida gloves which is a travesty [Music] I will buy more at some point but I have to settle for these work gloves I don't know if these are biohazard rated like the velida gloves but at least it's a baron so I guess now we just it's not a good start is the power on oh that is that is really not a good sign it is very much plugged in my initial diagnosis was not promising I don't think it works but after spending a bit more time struggling with it I had an idea the first thing I want to try is to just plug a monitor into it and see how it responds I don't think it's going to make a big difference but let's see you never know no way it actually turned on now look at that it works very good now let's tear it apart but before the teardown I wanted to give it a quick wipe down with cleaning liquor to cleanse it from its previous Life as a gaming system in a brothel so now comes the fun part opening it up and figuring out how MSI screwed up the thermal solution thank you [Music] then we should just be able to oh yeah that pops right out and that is actually metal that's pretty cool oh and then I think you whoa you just pull the sides off oh do that and then you try and ignore all of the interesting stuff that we're seeing while unplugging that little clip for the RGB oh that's not nice oh that is fascinating so the first thing we see here is the graphics card and I think this is a GTX 1060 which will give you a rough idea of when this system came out and what's interesting about the cooling Solution on it is that it's passive you can see that there's no fans or anything going on we've just got quite a not dense fin stack which here it is compared to a more normal GPU cooler fin stack and then I'm guessing error just gets pulled through it by the fan in the top of the system so I'm very interested to see the temperatures on this and next to that is a slot for another graphics card which is pretty cool which funnily enough seems to also use an mxm slot like that Alienware laptop I upgraded so you could get this MSI trash can Mac with two graphics cards in it which is pretty terrifying and next to that mxm connector we've got an m.2 slot with nothing plugged in but you do have the option and then behind that GTX 1060 we have of our Ram slots so it uses laptop RAM and there is actually an additional set of slots behind that so you can drop four sticks of ram in here and then behind this rear i o is the main motherboard this is our CPU Cooler which again is kind of passive because it doesn't have a fan attached straight to it it's just got like a whole system-wide fan at the top as far as I understand under this cooler we have an i7 7700 so we've got all these little motherboards around the power supply in the center of the system this is quite a neat design MSI stole from Apple and I think this is the point of the video where I jump to the Future because I'm going to go test this now before I tear it down further but you'll just see the rest of the teardown process so I guess our first order of business in the future is to remove the graphics gun it doesn't feel like that did a whole lot so let's just undo screws until something happens [Music] front bit of the bit of thick so I'm guessing I'm gonna have to remove this first but after undoing the screws removing that front bit proved challenging oh there we go wow that process was more dramatic than expected but I got the front bit off and now we have cleaner access to the graphics cards but with the front bit out the way I wasn't out the woods yet I still couldn't get the graphics board out so I decided next I needed to tackle ripping off the top of the case [Music] oh oh yes that's quite a lot of Separation that's happening and I think the last couple of screws that we need to undo are the ones up here I mean can I take this off first oh there we go so this beauty is all of the active Cooling and you can see it's it's just a huge blower fan and it had oh and it has a whole bunch of little cables that come off it which means this dragon logo actually lights up that's something you won't see on a Mac and in this is a much better top-down look at the layout of the case so we've got the two kind of GPU bits over here that is the CPU bit of the motherboard and then that middle part is the power supply it's just in a slot that's quite tight yeah there you go do you have long hair I hope that's mine looking at this the system's kind of like a laptop hybrid because we've got this mxm laptop GPU that they're adapting to the Dustbin system using a PCI Express daughter board another weird thing about this GPU setup is that all of the screws that hold the mxm board in place are underneath the cooler so we're gonna have to remove that first [Music] yeah I can pull that off now and that's what our GPU heatsink looks like I love that look of like aged heatsink copper it's always cool and then this is our 1060 with very dry thermal paste on it we definitely need to replace that [Music] where you have to also undo this standoff damn these are really stuck down there but either way there is our fully naked GPU that that feels perfectly reasonable whoa look at that oh that is a really stupid process holy louder so what happened there is you have these standoffs that when the motherboard's mounted it actually is flush all the way here and you have to pull it off like bend it out and then oh what a terrible process and then under there we have our CPU board which also connects via pcie to the kind of main Hub in the bottom of the system but let's get this cooler off and have a closer look [Music] whoa that is remarkably dry thermal paste I'm surprised nothing exploded so I'm definitely going to replace that but as you can see under that we have our 7700 and then there is our power delivery and then the final thing before I put this back together and do some gaming on it and see what thermal paste changes did this is the power supply 450 watt power supplies I'm really hoping they had higher end ones for slides systems even if they are using laptop gpus and after that wishful thinking I laboriously reassembled the system to test the effect of the fresh new thermal paste which went well oh I didn't reassemble it correctly but that's later's problem first we need to have a look at the initial testing [Music] it's pretty clear that the seller installed a fresh copy of Windows on here because we don't have a ridiculous MSI background and there's no bloatware on it I'm 100 sure it didn't come from the factory like that so that's good [Music] now putting aside the the wine temperatures at least on the GPU initially are really good it's under 50 degrees Celsius it's not being utilized very much but still you know that's really impressive performance wise it is running well this is a 1080p High settings and as you can tell from the frame time graph which was suggested by a viewer uh it's running stably the game the game feels nice and smooth but let's move over to a game that doesn't regularly have systems running it basically at idle wow Battlefield 5 a 1080p medium settings is running very well and surprisingly for an MSI pre-built despite a bunch of Battlefield having happened already we don't have temperatures that are mimicking the center of the sun although the CPU is getting up there and it's pretty noisy now all the hardware is showing its age a little bit considering that this is 1080p low settings it is still playable cyberpunk does have a tendency to feel a bit sluggish below 60 frames per second but again very player and because AMD is not Nvidia we also have the option to turn on some Fidelity FX and just like that with a little bit of fidelity FX going it's running better although you can really tell the Fidelity effects ooh big accident uh but yeah there's quite a lot of smearing and stuff happening in in especially in the very contrasty areas okay so a 1080p low settings Last of Us is running uh now the same with cyberpunk at 40 frames per second this game feels quite heavy heavier than like GTA 5 does at 40 frames per second so it's it's not a great experience but it's it's running so the system still works well and despite the higher noise the temperatures are better than I was expecting but how much did the thermal paste application help and could I get the system running again oh I didn't reassemble it correctly this ribbon cable came loose real easy so I think that's the culprit let me plug it back in and see okay it's not turning on so maybe it refuses to run with the outside panels off a few moments later okay attempt nine thousand well the top bit lights up now that's good that's less good though so it clearly wasn't one of the 800 ribbon cables being loose which meant I just had one idea left so I've swapped over from the HDMI to Mini DisplayPort which is a long shot but let's see if that helps oh think louder I I just broke the HDMI somehow but at least the DisplayPort works so the repaste is a bit of a mixed bag we've got slightly lower temperatures on the CPU but the GPU is slightly higher and it still is noisy so all that effort wasn't really worth it which brings me to the end of a particularly frustrating teardown thank you very much Carrie for helping out with the system and thank you everybody for watching bye-bye [Music]",

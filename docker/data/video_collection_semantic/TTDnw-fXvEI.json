    "transcript": "- [Ken] This episode of Krazy Ken's Tech Misadventures is sponsored by Linode. This is a Mac Mini. This is an Apple TV. Is it possible to get the desktop operating system Mac os X that's on this Mac Mini to be installed on this Apple TV? Let's find out. (upbeat music) Hey guys, how are you all doing? Really that's just great. You know, I'm doing pretty great today too because there's someone very special in my life here. My stylist. I finally got a haircut after all this time, the pandemic maybe, I didn't get a haircut for like four months. So now my hair is shorter again. And to all the people who said my head is round, this is now proof, it's not round. It's gorge shaped. Oh, I'm also here with Brainiac Brent. - Hello. - So Brainiac Brent wanted to help out with a project. What do you got there? - So we have the first generation Apple TV here. And what has come to my attention is that this is based on the Core M Intel processor - Right. - Therefore-- - Mac OS X. - Get an Intel version of Tiger on here and you have a full desktop version operating system running on an Apple TV. - So it's a Core M, and it's a hard disk mechanical so it may not be that fast. - What do you think the most intensive app, this thing will be able to run is? - Mail. (laughing) So here's the plan. And normally this is where I would like to put up a big graphical fun presentation for you but we've spent all of that money on our other show Krazy Ken's Tech Talk, which means we've only had enough graphical budget left to do this. (buzzing) Yeah, that's not very good. So I used the whiteboard. Go ahead Brent, pass me the whiteboard. - Here we are. - All right. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna take the Apple TV which is right here. We're gonna take the PATA hard drive, it's not SATA it's a PATA hard drive. Out of it, we're gonna put it in this enclosure, which basically turns it into an external USB drive, right? And we're gonna plug that into an iMac, and with the iMac, we're gonna install Mac OS 10.4 Tiger. And we have to do a few other things too. We have to put a new boot EFI file on there, a Mach kernel file, and we have to remove some text and some other chase. So what we're also gonna do is we're gonna make a backup of the drive that's in here, just so we can restore the Apple TV system later. And seems pretty simple. It should work go ahead and send that back. - Yeah, there's less steps so there's less points for it to break. But-- - We just jinxed it. - Nothing ever goes right here so. - No, uh huh, no, not at all. And a great example of that would be the SSD episode we just released recently. So what do say? Wanna get started? - Yes. - I don't. All right, so the Apple TV is prepped for surgery and by the way, thank you Brainiac Brent for busting out your Amazon Prime subscription to rush ship this Zheino to us. - Yeah no problem. - Also I just wanna remind you, the Computer Clan is an Amazon Associate. So anything you buy from any of our lists or anything on Amazon at all, if you buy it through our link, you actually support the Computer Clan channel as well. So if you wanna do that, that would be greatly appreciated. - Have fun. All right, go ahead and bust out your torque. - Yeah, we had to kinda peel this back. It's all glued on here. - Mm hmm. - Let's go ahead and examine some of this damage here. So yep. - Ooh. - I mean, it's been sitting and doing nothing for a while. I mean there could be a bit of dry rotting happening too honestly. - Yeah, it's even nastier as we go to this corner 'cause there's all that and then-- - Oh, that's delicious. - Second one now. - That's delicious. Go ham on that one. - I wouldn't fry that on a processor. I mean sir have some more. We're gonna lift up and we're gonna be careful not to lift up too much 'cause there's the drive attached to this panel here. - Yeah. - The cable attached to a panel. - Yep, so there's a PATA ribbon cable. - So we have a Fujitsu Apple branded drive. They put the screws on the underside of this. - Oh yeah, more rubber and glue in the way. - Yeah, so-- - All right, so now we busted out one of the I don't know if this is called a spudger but it's a pointy thing. - Metal scribe, no idea. (dramatic music) Yeah we're good. So that will probably just fall out. No, it's still in there a little bit. - Okay, so I started prying it and I heard like a sticky sound. And he said something it's not like a typical glue. Does it look like a strip of gum? Let's eat it, no. I will remove the PATA cable. And now we're gonna bust out our Zheino. - Registered trademark. - Registered trademark, all right. - Careful 'cause there is like a four pins. That's kind of like a little further away from the connector, but it looks like things will line up fine. - Is the board supposed to bend up like that? - I think it does a little bit, yeah. - That looks pretty good to me. - We won't be able to close it with that in the way, I don't think. I don't think we need to. - Good point. - Well, it's not like we need to. - Yeah. Lets leave that open then. - Yeah. - Yeah, that's if you wanna like put in your pocket and walk around the quad like yo, yo, peeps, I got a PATA in my pocket. So we have the USB connected bus powered. So now the next step, plug it into the iMac right? - First things first backup, but-- - Oh, yes, plug it into the iMac and make a backup. - And make a back up, yup. - All right, let's do it. We have this amazing 2007 iMac here with us. So thank you Ian for donating this to the show. And this is what we're gonna use to do all the magic. So here we have the enclosure, Brent, you're closer to the port so go ahead and. - On your. - No on your side. - No, this isn't the power button. - Oh, wait a minute, what? What am I-- - Right there. - Well, that's embarrassing. I'm gonna turn in my non existent Apple certification right now. - Don't worry about it. I had a little bit. - I'm seriously concerned. - what that you thought the poor throw over here? - Yeah, I was thinking of the G5 where the ports are by the power button and the power they go there but even on the G5 they're on this side but so with the power button. Okay, we're gonna forget that ever happened. I've never browsed this before, this is interesting. So this is basically how the Apple TV system is all set up here. - Yeah, there's a very small partition just for booting the operating system holding system stuff. And then this is where it actually stores the media. - Oh, they call the user Front row. 'Cause that's the name of the feature in Mac OS that gives you that interface that the Apple TV uses. - Yep. - That is so cool, I never knew that. Yeah, here we go, ooh. This is how the Apple TV basically looks like. It's the same interface basically. - How did you launch that? - Command escape? - Really? - Yeah. - So what we're gonna do, I'm gonna launch terminal. So it is disk one. From there, need to run a DD command dot image. Wait, I gotta give a file name. - Just TV. - Tv.image. And I'll give it a block size of 1024k because why not? And cross our fingers. - Yeah, okay, it's getting there. It's getting there. Now we just gotta basically wait for it to copy probably a couple gigs into it. - Yeah, unfortunately, DD doesn't give you any feedback in the terminal. - You've done a -v flag to get a verbose? - Probably I'm unfamiliar with DD but I can't believe this is here. - Yeah thanks. This is working thanks to quick look. So yeah, now we basically just wait a little bit. Okay, so we've been here for about a little over an hour. We're at 37.9 gigs. Hey Brent, guess what? - Mm hmm. - I'm really happy this isn't the 120 gigabyte version of the Apple TV. Okay, so 40 gigs hopefully it's done soon. And a look at that. Oh, it told us how long it took. So now you know how long we we've waiting? - And how fast the interface is? What is that, seven megabytes a second? - Wow. (laughing) Wow, that is freaking slow. - So now, do you have your Tiger installation media? - No, I should go get that. - Now we are at a standstill. - Well, you know you've been waiting a long time when the computer gets so bored it asks you about an Adobe update. - We have the install for Tiger. And the website that we're reading from says we specifically need 10 for eight. And conveniently enough that is exactly the version on this disk. - Fantastic. This is the disc that came with my first iMac that I got. - Nice. - Pop it in? - Yep. (buzzing) - All right, okay. - You know we're not installing it under this-- - Yeah, it's not smart enough to know that, so there's probably a way we can get around that. (buzzing) - That's it. - It was probably trying to automate something and it was like no, can't do that, it's too new. We're gonna try to trick it a little bit. Hang on a second. - I think it really need to be modified. - I really don't think it's gonna run at all. The Apple TV operating system, but it shows up as a bootable option. - There's two of them so we can try it. - I'm this curious. It's probably just gonna give us like a verbose counts. Whoa. - Hello. - I was not expecting that. I would be surprised if it actually boots up but I'm-- - Oh my. - Reboot? - Yeah, I heard the fan's kick down. - Yep. We got the logo though. - I'm gonna try just to see what happens. - I was not expecting-- - It freaked me out. You should not see that logo on the--. (laughing) - I'm surprised that we even got that far. That's pretty cool. Yeah, we'll try the other device. - That's so blurry. I want that on a regular Mac OS installed now. - You could do that with a boot exchanger? Yeah, on older systems, you could there was a little utility that just modified them, I don't know where the images were stored at the time. Probably they're currently in the EFI file. But yeah, so boot exchanger. Yeah, it's gonna do the same thing I think. That's still pretty cool though. - I love that so much. (chuckles) It's reminds me of early iPod touches. - Yeah, the old iOS with a pen. I'm gonna do it in verbose mode just for (beep) giggles. - Yeah. - Just to see-- - See where it stopped. - Yeah, okay, if I loaded from device looking for kernel cache file mackernel.prelink. It probably can't find that for... Oh, hang on. Oh, I couldn't even read that. But we'll have to check the playback. (buzzing) We'll pull the tapes. In the meantime, we're gonna throw this into the CD installer, which is gonna take our DVD installer, which can take about five minutes anyway. So hey, we have something to do during the downtime, yay. So we're about loaded in the installer, we pulled the tapes, and yes, it did basically just kernel panic and auto reboot. Anyway, now that the curiosity is out of the way we can actually get back to doing the thing that will work. - Hopefully. - Oh no, don't do this. - Is it still gonna, so is this where we break out another Mac? - Boom. The cool thing about having a Mac collection is you just have when you need it. We need to format. We could probably do it from the installer, but we could just do it from disk screw-tility as a blog, as he calls it. We're gonna partition it. And we're done. All right, so we're gonna back out. And we're gonna customize this and we don't need all of this stuff. (mumbling) - Actually, what is in here? There actually might be some fun stuff to have in here too. - You get like iPhoto. And you can like do iLife applications. Well, let's uncheck fonts and language translations. We don't need this. That that. I don't know, let's keep iPhoto just to have one iLife app on there. Oh, it's too lazy. I'm just kidding. We have it. - Yeah, we have this right here. - I know it's way over here. - I will get it for you. - I don't think you can do that. - I will get in my car and drive it to right over here. - You better cooperate I wanna turn this installation sensation around. - Turns the iMac around. (laughing) Okay, this is probably gonna be about 20 to 30 minutes. But also it is a pay to drive so it actually might be longer, I'm scared. But before we continue, let's take a quick second to talk about Linode. No matter what skill level you're at, or what technology stack you use, Linode makes it easy to give your creations their own personal space on the internet. If you just need something small, like a simple website, games server or personal VPN, Linode has you covered. If you need to manage tons of websites and reliably serve them to millions of visitors, well guess what, Linode can do that too. Unlike entry level hosting services that lock you into their platform, Linode gives you full backend access to customize and control your server to fit your needs. Their DNS manager allows you to easily switch your domain to your new server. And SSL certificates can be installed for free using open source tools. And here's another cool thing. If you run into any problems getting set up, Linode comes with amazing 24/7 customer support by phone or ticket along with hundreds of docs to help get you started. And because you're here and because we're all best friends, you amazing Computer Clan viewers get a free $20 credit on a new Linode account. You can sign up with the link in the description. All right, now back to the Mac. Alright, so we're shifting the disk two. The slot is there. And Yep, and this will probably install iPhoto and the Front row I think is on here too. Software installation is done. Cube transition. - Yeah. (laughing) - Okay, so now and Brent feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. we gotta set the startup disk back to the internal drive so then we can actually access the kernel file and all that crap we need to futz with. Brent copied the boot EFI and the Mach kernel files from the Apple TV system software or OS, whatever you wanna call it. - And here's also a kext for the Ethernet on there as well. - That is true. So plug it in. On the Apple TV hard drive now, which is running Mac OS X. We just go to System, library, core services, that's where this stuff is hiding. So here's the boot EFI file, which has a lock icon on it, which we could probably override with some sort of terminal stuff, but let's just try without it, okay. Can't do that. Can we just ignore ownership? - Can you click up? - Yep. - Locked. (talking over each other) - I mean, we have permission to do this. So replace the file. (laughing) I forgot there's a checkbox that literally says lock. Okay, so now here's the Mach kernel. I think back a few directories. - In the root of the drive. - I was gonna say, Yep, it's in the root. So we're gonna need to do some sneaky (beep). All right. Sudo defaults, right? Is that two words? - No, it is. - Oh, it is? - Yeah. - com.apple.finder Apple show all files, true it. - So I mean, even if it wasn't sudo it should still do it. - I used to be able to do this just fine, but lately I feel, oh, there we go. I guess there's no need to run a sudo. Yeah, you're right. There we go. So now the Mac should just show up right here. Look at that. All right, so we're gonna try to do a move. I'm not 100% sure if this is gonna work. But because it's invisible, we can't do it in the Finder super easily. So I'm gonna do a move of this over this and it should prompt an overwrite or just does it. Wrong, this was... Oh, it refreshed. - There you go. - The window just did refresh. So the file moved into here. - Oh, okay. - Yeah and overrode it. So we're good. - I want that file back. - Oh, well, we can get it later. - Okay. (laughing) - In the nether we just sent it to. (laughing) - Yeah, I wasn't really expecting to lose the file in its place. - Now let's go back and get that Ethernet kext. This mouse really needs a mousepad, we're gonna put this kext in here. And we need to delete a few Nvidia kext I believe. - Five of them. - Okay which ones are they? All right so then we'll just throw these in the trash and we will empty the trash. Okay, so we replaced the Mac boot EFI, we added the Ethernet kext, we deleted the Nvidia kexts. I think that's it. - Run bless. - All right, we gotta bless it. Do you wanna drive for this part? - Yes. - Okay, Brent-- (laughing) - Brent is gonna-- - Brent is gonna bless the hard drive. So I've actually never used the Bless command before but is it basically just telling the startup disk to look for a new EFI file? Or how does that work? - I don't know what bless does. - Cool. I'm gonna man this. Man bless. Bless set volume bootability. All right, well, we got that figured out. Yep and just press return, boom okay. - All right. - We are blessed. Now we just have to reconnect the PATA drive to the Apple TV and should boot. Should boot. All right, so we have the Cinema Display hooked up with a DVI to HDMI adapter with the HDMI plugged into the Apple TV. The hard drive is back in. And yeah, there's no power switch so we basically just plug in the power cord and go. If this works, it should boot into OS X and we do have a keyboard and mouse hooked up through the USB port as well. So Brainiac Brent, since this is kind of your pet project did you wanna plug it in? - I would love to do that. - All right, do the honors. Plug that boy in. (upbeat music) All right. So we got the amber light. Hard drive is spinning. Now let's see if this works. The light went off so it detected a signal. That's usually what that means. Ooh. - Ooh. - Dude, okay. That's like a too excited, yeah but that's a good first step. - I wonder if the status indicator is gonna change. - That'd be interesting. - Is it just me or is that pinwheel a tad slower than it's supposed to be? - It does look a little slower. Oh, dude, starting OS X. - That's a good sign, we're in. - Okay, hang on. Let's wait until everything loads. - Menu, menu bar, everything and icons. There's our Dock. - Oh my gosh. You should be the first one to touch the cursor, not me. A mouse support works. Can I test the keyboard at least? It's loading. See, we knew he was gonna be kind of sluggish but it's running fricking Mac OS X on an Apple TV. We basically just made our own Like slow Mac Mini. (laughing) - Even the beach ball's slow. - Oh my god this is great. There you go guys. - It's restoring our windows. Go check the About this Mac. - Oh yeah. - One gigahertz, oh no. (laughing) It does it doesn't know what the Core M. It was never made to run on a Core M. Okay so we gonna run some updates here and see if that helps with anything. My hopes are a little low but we'll just do it anyhow. Okay while that's going in the background let's test the speed of this thing. Let's launch iPhoto. (talking over each other). That's interesting. - That's a quartz animation. Those are the smoothest, those are the easiest. - Typically. it's weird that the animations are like even slow. - Yeah. - That's what's really interesting there. But like window movement, once it works. Oh, that's chapiest, hell no, it was smooth like, that's... Okay, that's nice. That's nice. - I've never seen that kind of repainting. (laughing) That's a Windows pre arrow. - All right, so we're gonna do a restart. I guess we could actually do a shut down. So, you know, frozen progress bar on shut down, we're shutting down and installing some software updates. It's just kinda stuck here but doesn't know how to shut down? The hard drive isn't making any activity. - It might be trying to switch to a sleep mode that's not supported by this hardware. - Yeah. 'Cause there's no power button either. It's like you said earlier, it's off the record raspberry pie. - Yeah. - Gotta pull the power cord but you can still shut down a pie. - You can still shut down a pie like it will. It doesn't really turn like the status light off. You'll at least get a signal done from your display. - I think it is like as far as it can go. Next time we should verbose it to see what it gets to. - Yeah. But yeah, I'm pretty sure we just have to. - I'm pretty sure it's trying to set it to like a P5 or whatever state and that's just not supported. - Well, I know how to do this. I can't possibly screw this up. (blasting) I can't possibly screw this up. Hey, it worked. Okay, so Brent's going back to track down some files again, because when we ran those software updates, it's possible that the Mach kernel file and maybe even the boot EFI were changed back to the normal ones. And now the system can't boot up. I've actually never even seen that screen before. I didn't know it existed. So we're gonna get those files back, replace them and try to boot up again. Also, it could just be me, but it looks like the amber light blinks at a different rate when this issue is happening. It's almost like it's calling out for help or something. I thought that was interesting. Okay, so Brent found out the Nvidia kext also reloaded onto the system. So even if we weren't able to boot the system, we might have had some issues with that. So you will blessed the thing, you put the Mach kernel on there, the EFI blessed it and should be good to go. Do you wanna plug her in? - Yes. - All right, go nuts 'cause we don't have a power switch on this thing. (laughing) - Hopefully remove that keyboard and mouse back over. - Oh yeah, we have the keyboard plugged into the iMac so we could do the maintenance. Here we go. Hey, there you go. I forgot the verbose that 'cause I wanted to check something, but-- - Is it late for that? - It might be too late for that. So what we're gonna do next is I'm gonna put some sample files on here. I have some photos and some videos that I just wanna test the performance of the system with. Okay, so I use Safari to download my stuff folder from my web server. I have some pictures and some video I just wanna test playback performance here. So let's start with a 720p QuickTime movie 8264. It's a trimmed excerpt of one of our other episodes. This is the Island Episode from Krazy Ken's Tech Talk. And let's see. Oh yeah, we're getting about like 10 frames a second probably less. Yep, 11.37. It's cool how all the metadata is still readable here. - Does closing that window help us any? - It might help a little. Oh, look at that cross. (laughing) - On a less intense thing like this, it's doing a little better. But maybe I just notice it less because it's little motion-- - Is chugging, let's try scrubbing. - I hear the disk going high pitched now. - Yeah, that disk is like ah, and my pain, you assholes. - This is 720p. - Yeah, I don't even know if I wanna open the 10 ADP one, but we're gonna do it anyway. Oh, crap. - It's larger than the monitor. - There we go. (laughing) - It cannot keep up at all. - Can't do crap. Okay, so, video playback with Mac OS X on the Apple TV, probably not the greatest. Now if you use the Apple TV normally, it can play video pretty decently, so. - When it doesn't have the overhead of Mac OS, yes. - Yes, there's a lot of extra overhead we're introducing into the poor computer. So now let's just try a basic task, like what you would do with your iLife applications importing photos. So I'm gonna drag some photos onto iPhoto. And I'm gonna ask Microsoft people say drag and drop onto the photo icon there and see if we can handle a task like this. Okay, took a couple minutes to do the 19 photos, but it's persevering. So let's go ahead and attempt to zoom these thumbnails in. Oh, that was actually kinda quick. - By this computer standards. - By this computer standards. Yeah, so yeah, I mean, it works. Here's one of the new wallpapers we made recently. Let's double click, let it load. And we should be able to set this as our wallpaper from here at least I think. - Share desktop. - Maybe that just exports to the desktop. Maybe it actually sets it as the desktop, that would be great. Oh, that's a squeal. - Oh no. - There it is. That's a squealing hard drive. Here we go we got a sexy new wallpaper. - Minimize that. I wanna see the genius. - Oh yeah, should I do it slower? To see if you can do it? - Sure. - Decently? Oh. - The hard drive is squealing. - Oh man. - Oh, it smoothed out once it got towards the bottom though. - It did smooth. Yep, that's not too bad. We're getting like a little bit of tearing to no big surprise, but wow. - Oh, overall, that's acceptable. - Let's listen to that again. Dude. (laughing) - That's interesting that it affects the hard drive that way trying to-- - Bizarre. I'm sure someone watching can explain that to us. Okay, so now we're gonna attempt to reboot it into verbose mode so we can determine what's happening with shut down because it seems to be getting stuck on shutdown. It's rebooting. I have Command V down on the keyboard. I'm not sure if it's gonna be able to interpret. Oops, got some extra V's in there. I held the keys too long. But hey, there we go. We are booting into verbose mode. Well, let's try a shutdown and see if it gets stuck this time, like it did earlier. And if it does get stuck, we should at least be able to interpret where it's getting stuck. CPU halted. And that's what I'm thinking. - It's trying to put it into a power state that this device doesn't support. - Yeah, you can't shut it down. You can reboot it, but to shut it down, you just gotta pull the power. - I mean, you can still software shut it down to appropriately end your session, but from there the device won't power-- - True. this is basically saying it is now safe to turn off your computer. - Exactly like a computer that doesn't support ACPI if I have those letters in the correct order, APCI I think. - So what do you think guys? That's how you take your first generation Apple TV and basically turn it into a Mac Mini. Just a slow Mac Mini. - Slow, but still very functional. And I'm grateful that we ran into very few snags and it booted for try. - I was not expecting it to be, quote and quote, that easy. Future things we could do, we can maybe get a newer version of Mac OS X on here, maybe hook it up to a sound system, so we might do a follow up episode, could be. - I do have an adapter for SPDIF two, 3.5 millimeter and then I can supply some PC speakers and try that out. - Totally. So thank you Brainiac Brent for being here. - Thank you for having me. - You're a genius. And thank you guys for following along with us. Catch the crazy and pass it on. (upbeat music)",

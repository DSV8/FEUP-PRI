    "transcript": "- [Michael] It almost couldn't be a worse time to launch a budget-conscious smartphone. Yes, people are being more frugal, but there are already amazing options out there. If Apple's new iPhone SE lives up to its predecessor it'll easily earn its $400 price tag. And rumors have Google's Pixel 4a launching soon, around the same price. If that weren't enough, last year's excellent Pixel 3a just dropped to 299. Which I think is the deal of the year, so far. With competition like that, you gotta ask why anyone would wanna buy a Moto G for 299. And my answer would ordinarily be no one, not even for the stylus and the silo. Were it not for a reduction at the retailer's. (peaceful techno music) Yeah, the Moto G Stylus is so-named because it comes with a pen in the pocket. There is a Moto G Power out there as well, but I love the pen as a concept. And I told Motorola, please just send me the Moto G Stylus. Why do I love the pen so much? Well, most importantly, it's like a mouse for your Moto. Look, we've known for years how disgustingly germ-ridden our phones are. So it's nice to be able to tap and scroll your way through the interface with a pen, instead of well, you know, smearing your finger all over the gross glass. You've gotta remember to disinfect the pen, of course. But anything that keeps your fingers a little cleaner, especially right now, is a win. There's a little smartness in here, too. You can set the Moto notes app to automatically launch when you take the stylus out. And if you put the pen down and forget to replace it, the phone'll remind you the next time you wake it up. It can even tell you the last time you took the pen out and where you were when you did so. So you can go back and try to find it. Now keep in mind, this is a budget phone, so this isn't an S pen with a bajillion levels of pressure sensitivity. It's not a remote control for the camera. It's a metal stick with a nub on the end. This is for signing documents, or doing some light edits in SnapSeed. Or blotting out my personal details on a bill, so I can show you what four nights in a hospital would've cost me if I didn't have health insurance. Yeah, pneumonia sucks. Don't risk getting sick, folks, if you have to go out, like I did when I took these pictures on the way to the store. Wear a mask and gloves. While we're talking photos, Motorola has never been great at them. The colors tend to be off, the dynamic range tends to be lacking, the night mode tends to be bad. I think the company knows this, and so it tends to try and make up for that with toys like Spot Color and Cinemagraph and a bunch of portrait modes. You know, I don't know maybe it's because this camera's hiding the five extra quarantine pounds I've put it on so far, but I like these selfies a lot more than I expected to. No actually, the real reason is the better edge detection and depth effect than I expect from a budget phone. Particularly on the front facing camera. Also more than I expected? (camera snaps) The number of cameras. Three of them on the back, topped off by a dedicated video camera Motorola has physically installed sideways. So you can shoot video in landscape while holding the phone vertically. The idea is that's more comfortable and this is a so-called \"action\" camera for skateboarding or bumpy adventures. (peaceful techno music) Put those features together with that twist-wrist camera lock shortcut and it's almost enough to make me forget the inherent inferiority of the low light performance. The hamstrung image processing as a result of that cheaper image processor. But not quite. Same with those other Motorola hallmarks I love so much. Moto Display is still the best always on display on the market, fight me. And paired with Android 10, all the special Motorola gestures and shortcuts should make the phone a pleasure to use. But in a word, it's slow. In another word, it's laggy. In another word, it's inconsistent. You get the picture. And the screen you use all this on is just plain ugly. Tilt it just a little and all the brightness drains away. There's unsightly modeling too, all around the perimeter and the selfie camera. It's not a defect, it's just a cheap LCD. You've gotta cut some corners to kick out an affordable smartphone, and you can also see that on the backplate, which smudges up the second you take it out of the box. And the whole thing feels plasticky, despite the heft. Now to its credit, Motorola made the most of the thickness. Found room for a headphone jack, big speakers. That means the G Stylus is a good companion for speakerphone calls and video conferences. I had like a hour-long Zoom call that was really cool. And the aforementioned heft is partly due to a big battery. Like the OnePlus's I got two days out of this thing with light to moderate use. (peaceful techno music) Does any of that make this thing worth buying at 299? I gotta say, no. Not in a world where the Pixel 3a exists. In fact, I was gonna bag this video entirely, until I saw this story from PhoneArena. If you get the Moto G Stylus through some retailers in the States with a new line of service, the price comes down to 199 on Sprint or 149 on Verizon. When you consider all you're getting for that price, this bizarre amalgamation of action camera and poor man's Galaxy Note. Well, then, and only then, it's a good deal. (peaceful techno music) This video was produced after two weeks with Moto G Stylus review sample provided by Motorola. But I don't take money from manufacturers or retailers for reviews, nor do I offer copy approval or early preview rights the same. That means Motorola is seeing this for the firs time right alongside you. If you really wanna support the channel, please, go watch a video I care deeply about, but which very few people watched, my Moto Razor review. I miss that thing. Until next time, thanks for watching. And even if you can't leave the house, the spirit of the sign-off is the same. Stay mobile, my friends. (peaceful techno music)",

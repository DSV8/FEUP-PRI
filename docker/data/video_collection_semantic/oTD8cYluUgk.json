I'll also show you how to install applications like nmap and get a GUI working with Kali Linux. By default, when you install Kali Linux with WSL 2, you won't have a GUI, but in this video I'll show you how to get that installed and configured. Go from zero to hero with Kali Linux on WSL 2.  WSL2 is part of Windows 10, version 2004 which was released in May 2020. Rather than using a translation or compatibility layer between Linux and Windows which was used in WSL 1, WSL 2 uses virtual machine technology to allow you to run a real Linux kernel directly on Windows 10. This also allows you to run Docker within Ubuntu running on Windows 10.

    "transcript": "- In this video, I'm going to show you a number of things. I'm going to show you how to get Kali Linux downloaded and installed and running within WSL version two, running within Windows 10. I'm going to show you how to download applications such as Nmap so that you can check for open ports on devices, but in addition, I'm going to show you how to get the graphical user interface installed and running on Kali so that you can manage the Kali Linux device running within WSL version two using remote desktop. So rather than just getting a CLI, which is the default that you'll get when you install Kali on WSL version two, I'll show you how to get a graphical user interface installed and running. Okay, let's get started. (energetic synth music) Now in this video, I am doing everything on this Windows 10 laptop, I'm controlling the Windows 10 laptop using VNC from my Mac, but I'm actually doing everything on this Windows 10 laptop. On the Kelly or Kali Linux website, they discuss using WSL version two with Kali and they say that Kali Linux has had support for WSL version one for some time, but it was somewhat limited, especially with regards to networking. WSL version one had problems with speed, specifically input/output, which were problematic. The reason why is that in WSL version one, they were using a translation layer between Linux and Windows 10, so there was sort of this translation layer, translating system calls between Linux and Windows 10. Now however, they're using virtualization technologies. So it's a lot better in WSL version two, versus WSL version one. However, they are still investigating how useful it is, but what I'm gonna show you now is how to get this up and running. It's very simple to get Kali Linux up and running on a Windows 10 computer. Okay so on my Windows 10 laptop, I'm gonna go to the Microsoft store, I'm gonna search for Kali and notice this entry, Kali by Offensive Security. I'm gonna click on that and I'm gonna click get, and I'm gonna click install. Kali is downloading, it's about 185 meg in size. I'm gonna click launch to start the installation. We can see that it's now being installed. We're asked to create a default Linux user account. This doesn't have to be the same as my Windows username. So I'm going to simply call this Kali and set the password as Kali. So in other words, this is similar to the default username and password that you get if you download the prebuilt virtual machine from Kali. Okay, so there you go, it's installed. So lsb_release -a. We're told that that command doesn't exist. Let's go, uname -a. We can see that we're using Linux on my ASUS laptop. Could also try cat /etc/os-release and as you can see, their pretty name is Kali Linux Rolling. I can see that the version is 2020.2. Okay, I'll clear the screen. Can I ping a device in my physical network? This is a Cisco router. I need to use sudo to run that command. So I'll put my password in and notice I can ping a Cisco device from within this virtual machine running within WSL version two, I'll start PowerShell and notice wsl -l -v shows me that I've got Kali Linux running and I've also got Ubuntu virtual machines running. So in other words, this Kali Linux virtual machine is running within WSL on my Windows 10 computer. Okay let's do a sudo apt update to update references. So Kali is now connecting to the internet and making sure that the references are updated, I could upgrade software, but I'm simply gonna use the command sudo apt install Nmap to install Nmap on this Kali Linux host. So now I have Nmap installed and I could use that to check devices on my network. Okay so let's use Nmap to check the ports on my Cisco router. This is a physical Cisco router in my network. So let's paste that in and check which ports are opened on that router. We can see that Nmap is running. Okay so it's run a check against that router. We can see a whole bunch of ports are opened, including chargen, now you typically wouldn't enable that on a Cisco router. I enabled chargen and other ports on the Cisco router for this demonstration. So as an example, on my Cisco router, I enabled the TCP small servers. You don't typically enable that. So you wouldn't typically do that. So what I'll do on my Windows computers, open up a CMD prompt. So this is traditional CMD. I'll make this Kali Linux window bigger. So on my Windows computer, if I Telnet to the router on port 19, notice, we get a whole bunch of characters. So that's character generation on a Cisco router. That's again, something that you don't typically enable. It's not a good idea, so I'll close that. So you can see chargen is open. We can see SSH is open using Cisco SSH 1.25. We can see that Telnet is enabled, not a great idea for security reasons, so once again, I could Telnet to that router and I'd be able to log in to the router. It's not a good idea to use Telnet 'cause it's all in cleartext, but as you can see, a whole bunch of services are opened on that router and Nmap has been able to discover that for me. So I'm once again, using Nmap within Kali Linux on my Windows 10 laptop. Now this only currently has a CLI. You may want to run a GUI. In other words, get a GUI version of Kali running. So let's do that. Okay so to do that, I'm simply gonna install some software. So install Xfce, and then I'll install Xrdp. So we can see that the first installation is taking place. Now I'll speed up the installation 'cause it takes a while. Okay so I want to use US English and the software is now installed. Okay so now that that's installed I'll install Xrdp. Say yes to install the software, same thing happens. Software is downloaded and installed and what I'll do is start the Xrdp service. So that's now started and what I should be able to do is start remote desktop, so start remote desktop connection. What IP address am I going to connect to? So IP address on the Kali Linux host shows me that the IP address is this. So 172.18.108.119. I'm told that the identity of the remote device cannot be verified, I'm okay with that. I'm gonna say yes to connect and notice I'm presented with an RDP session. So I can now log in as Kali, Kali. The username and password that I configured. I'll click okay and notice, I now have Kali Linux running within an RDP session on my Windows 10 computer. So I'm connecting to my Kali Linux host. There's the IP address once again, 172.18.108.119 or to use the more modern command IP address. There's my IP address of my Kali Linux hosts running within RDP on Windows 10. So I'll close my remote session. So once again, I've got Kali Linux running within WSL version two, here's the CLI version. I'll use ifconfig old command there's the IP address and what I can do is once again, use remote desktop to connect to that device and once again, manage it through the GUI. So by using these commands, I can now connect to the Kali Linux host using remote desktop and manage it through the GUI. Okay so in this video, I showed you how to get Kali Linux up and running within WSL version two. I showed you how to install applications such as Nmap and I've also shown you how to install a GUI on Kali so that you can manage the Kali Linux host running within WSL version two, using remote desktop.

    "transcript": "- Today we're checking out this LG soundbar to go with my new LG TV. This is the S95QR soundbar, and this has an entire system, and I'm so hyped to set this up. Thanks to LG for partnering with me on this video. Right now, we're actually in my podcast room that I have turned into a podcast/guest room in my studio. So I've got this pullout couch, I've got the TV set up. So I've got it nice and cozy if I ever have guests that need a place to stay. So they can come here to the studio and I can just kind of put my microphones away, and it turns into a nice little guest bedroom. Guest bedroom/cinematic sound and television experience because with this new soundbar, it's going be so awesome in here. This also can double for when I have late nights editing. I don't have to go home, I can just sleep here. So yeah, guests or me. (upbeat music) Oh, this is so heavy. (upbeat music) This is so awesome. This room is gonna be so great. I think I'm moving into my studio. (upbeat music) Here she is. Look at it, it's beautiful. All right, everything is now unboxed, let's put it all together. (upbeat music) So I don't have these speaker stands yet, so I'm borrowing these ones from my desk just to see how I like them and how I like the height. And then I'm gonna update and get some other ones to really set this up. The installation of this thing was so easy, it was actually kind of mind blowing. Basically all I had to do was plug the HDMI from the eARC out to the eARC in on the TV, plug in the speakers and the subwoofer and everything just worked. Okay, time to calibrate them and see how they sound, I can't wait. So now everything's all set up, let's get this calibrated to the space. I'm so hyped, our podcast studio is finally coming together. With this soundbar and TV combination, we're able to use a WOW interface, and we can connect it to just using one remote. This will let you individually access each speaker to make sure it's working, and you could even adjust the settings and sound. So outside of the app, this allows us to calibrate it to the room, which is very exciting because obviously if you are in a larger room, it will sound differently. So let's start the calibration. (speaker beeping) (indistinct noise) So now that everything is all calibrated, I went in and turned on the WOW interface, and this will allow you to be able to use one remote and control each separate speaker just right here on the TV. So here you can see it brought up all of the settings and you can see all of our speakers individually. What's great about the WOW interfaces, this will allow you to only have to use one remote control to not only control your TV, but you could also control your soundbar at the same time. So as you can see here, this brings up our display, which shows us all of our connected devices. You can go in here and change the different settings if you like, except for me, I usually keep it in AI Sound Pro because it usually sounds amazing, but if you do wanna customize this further, you can conveniently use the single remote paired with a WOW interface to change it to standard, cinema, clear voice pro, sports, music, game optimizer, or even base blast. So depending upon what type of content you're watching, you can customize it directly for yourself or you could rely on AI to do it for you. The reason that this works so well is because this TV and soundbar are made to work together in perfect synchronization, which might not be the case if you're using a soundbar from a different manufacturer. So the fact that this is made by LG and made specifically for this TV, it's gonna sound amazing. Speaking of sounding amazing, let's test it out. It sounds so incredible. Even though this room is tiny, like this sound stage is massive, it feels like a cinematic experience. Wow! What's so special about Wild Orchestra is that not only does the audio come out of the surrounding speakers and the soundbar, but it's also coming out of the TV at the same time. This is really unique because usually most soundbars and surround sound systems will just replace the audio coming out of the TV, but this works with it to enhance your sound even more. It's also pretty awesome to be able to control this all with one remote. As you can see, I'm going up with the volume and down with the volume, all with one remote. - [Justin On TV] I was so excited to check out this Evo G3. Now the panel is a 3840 by 2160 4K Ultra HD self lit OLED. - My voice is all around me and I feel so weird, but it sounds so good. Okay, I need something a little more music. All right, let's turn this up. One remote. (upbeat music) This sounded so good, and what I love so much is the fact that I can only use one remote. This did come with another one, but since we have everything all synced up, I can control the volume directly from here, I can also control the TV, so everything is synced and working perfectly. Now, let's talk about these speakers. The S95QR is actually the world's first soundbar with an up firing center channel that lets you hear dialogue and other mid-range sounds way more clearly. This makes for a super clear dialogue and a really immersive sound experience. The soundbar has a total of 17 speaker drivers and rear up firing speakers for a full immersive experience and supports IMAX enhanced, Dolby Atmos, and DTSX formats. This really lets you experience the audio content the way it was meant to sound. Powering all of this is the Alpha 9 AI processor in the TV for automatic optimization of the soundbar sound quality. So no matter what you're watching, the sound is always amazing. I also love that it's compatible with voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant, and it even supports Airplay too. And on top of all of that, you can easily connect your phone via Bluetooth. I'm so excited about this new setup, and I can't wait to start recording some podcasts in here and maybe even have my first guest experience this entire setup. Thank you guys so much for watching. I had so much fun getting a chance to check this out, and I'm so hyped about my new addition to the podcast setup. If you guys wanna get more information about this soundbar, I'll put a link in the description.",

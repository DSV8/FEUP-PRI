    "transcript": "In many parts of the world, if youre taking a stroll outside or driving your car around at night time, youre likely to be basked in the orange-peach-gold-yellow whatever you want to call it glow common in street lighting. This particular hue of light has been a staple of outdoor lighting for decades, and it continues to be used widely. But, why that color? Well, its special kind of light bulb. Thanks for watching, I hope you enjoyed the video. No, of course were gonna go into more detail than that! Much of the worlds street lighting (and indeed more broadly outdoor lighting) uses sodium vapor lamp technology. The most common is high pressure sodium. This artificial lighting technology is a type of discharge lamp. Discharge lamps are very common in many applications because they are a very efficient way of creating light from electricity. Among the earliest sources of artificial light is the incandescent light bulb. Many, many people were working on its invention, so to say one person invented it is disingenuous at best, so Im just not gonna say anything because, well, no matter what I say Ill be wrong. But its principle of operation is really simple. Hot things glow. Make thing hot. Make thing hot without burning. Put hot thing in vacuum. Now that thing cant burn away. Light! By running electric current through a thin wire, that wire will get hot because of resistance and it will glow. Tada! The earliest light bulbs used a carbon filament, but shortly thereafter improvements in the ability to make tungsten filaments allowed for a brighter and longer-lasting bulb due to tungstens much higher melting point. I must recommend this video by the Engineer Guy about the tungsten filament lamp. Its great. Ive put a link down below. But anyway, incandescent lights arent very efficient. Creating light through incandescence wastes the vast majority of electrical energy on radiation that isnt visible light--simply infrared light and heat. Among the most common ways to measure efficiency is in lumens per watt, and incandescent bulbs are typically around 10 lumens per watt. Really efficient halogens and high-powered incandescents can reach 20 lumens per watt, but its still not great. But a discharge lamp, well that can be very efficient. When you send an electric discharge--basically a small electric arc--through an ionized gas, you get light! I wasnt very good at Chemistry in high school, so Im just gonna read the passage from Wikipedia which explains why. Ehem. In laymans terms, if you create an arc discharge through some gases, then because of ions and stuff bouncing around, youll end up with photons and depending on what the gas is, these photons will be a specific frequency and thus will produce a specific color of light. Ive put a link to the Wikipedia article down below because it has some great images of the colors produced by specific gases. The most common type of discharge lamp is actually the fluorescent lamp. The glass tubes in fluorescent lamps are filled with an extremely low pressure gas mixture made mostly of argon or neon used as a starter gas, and a wee bit of mercury which produces the main discharge. Mercury vapor on its own produces a very cyanish blue light, but it also produces a TON of ultraviolet light, which the phosphors that coat the glass will convert into visible light, and depending on the phosphors used you can get a very pleasant or very ghastly white light of various color temperatures. You can even use colored phosphors to make any color of light you want. Sodium vapor lamps rather than using mercury use...sodium. You guessed it! When sodium is ionized, its discharge is a very distinctive yellow hue with a wavelength of 589 nanometers. Low pressure sodium lamps emit light of pretty much just that wavelength. While useful, and actually the most efficient discharge lamp available, this light is monochromatic with a color rendering index of zero, so it is only useful as street lighting, and even then it's not great. Low pressure sodium lights are going to appear on this channel in the not-too distant future, but for now were sticking with high pressure sodium which is far more common these days. This is a 50 watt high pressure sodium lamp. This is the second smallest common size, with 35 watts occupying the smallest spot, but they go all the way up to 1,000 watts. In the center of the bulb is a small tube made of aluminum oxide--which for those that dont know is what rubies are. Of course this is synthetic, but due to the crazy reactivity of elemental sodium, it needs to be contained in something that will A) contain it without reacting with it and B) is quite strong and can withstand a lot of heat. Aluminum oxide fits the bill perfectly. Inside the tube theres a bit of xenon, as well as an amalgam of mercury and sodium. The mercury is added in high pressure sodium lamps to control the rate at which the sodium vaporizes. It also helps to improve the color rendering of the lamps by adding some blue light to their output. Just like any discharge lamp, a ballast is needed to limit the current the bulb can consume. Due to an arc discharge having negative resistance, as current goes up, resistance goes down, and power consumed will just skyrocket without a ballast or choke to stop it from destroying itself. The ballast will have either two or three components. First is the actual ballast itself which is similar in construction to a transformer, then there is the ignitor which is needed to start the lamp, and some ballasts including this one will place a large capacitor across the leads to help correct the poor power factor brought about by the inductive nature of the ballast. As with many discharge lamps, high pressure sodium lamps generally go through a distinct warmup routine. When first powered on, the ignitor is working to strike the arc. Once its been struck, it briefly glows a pinky-blue color as the xenon is ionized. Quickly the mercury starts to vaporize, and as it does so the ionization of the mercury vapor releases a pale blue color, often appearing as grey. But then the distinctive yellow of the sodium discharge takes over. As the sodium vaporizes, the lamp emits a very pure yellow color, which is not at all white. This is what the light from low pressure sodium lamps looks like. But then the high pressure in high pressure sodium does its thing. The arc tube is very small, and the gases inside it become quite hot. In a space of given volume, with increased temperature comes increased pressure. This results in a phenomenon called pressure broadening, which causes ordinarily weak spectral emissions to become stronger, and thus the lamp emits more wavelengths of light. Once completely warmed up, the pressure broadening causes the light to appear less yellow and more white, though still with a prominent yellow cast. Color perception is subjective, but Id call this a orangey-peachy-gold color with a hint of pink. You are you, yes? You are warming up right, youre on? OK Good. This is the most exciting part of the video, I guarantee it. I bet youve never had a video more exciting than this one. I dont even know what this looks like on camera. So well, well just. I should--I should have looked into that! Yeah. That was good. This light is extremely efficient, and the output it makes with only 50 watts is pretty striking, just like its arc. Ha! If I put it side-by-side with a 100 watt equivalent LED bulb (in a lamp that would never, EVER have an HPS bulb in any ordinary setting), you can tell that its much brighter. For half the energy of its incandescent equivalent, its producing about triple the light, going off lumens. This particular lamp produces 78 lumens per watt, which is 4 to 8 times greater than an incandescent. Some high pressure sodiums lamps are nearly twice as efficient as this one, producing 150 lumens per watt. Also, and this is hard to demonstrate on video, but the light from the sodium lamp appears to travel farther than that of the incandescent. The walls on the opposite side of the room seem much, much brighter than they do with a standard white light. Some of that has to do with the sodium D-line, thats the main yellow spectral emission, closely matching the peak sensitivity of the cells in our eyes. But only under photopic, daylight conditions. This gets kinda complicated and well get into it, but the peak sensitivity of the average human eye is 555 nanometers, and the HPS lamps peak output of 589 isnt far off. But dont fixate on that too much because, spoiler alert, this turns out to be a bad thing. Before we move on to their advantages, lets quickly discuss why we dont use this light source for general household illumination. Every artificial light source has whats called a CRI, or color rendering index. A CRI of 0 means its impossible to distinguish color, and a CRI of 100 is a perfect score, which the sun has. Incandescent lights has a CRI of 99, but most other light sources arent so high. Poor CRI plagued many fluorescent light sources, particularly early ones. Though the light of a CFL might appear perfectly white, the colors of objects underneath it might seem a little off. A cheap CFL might have a CRI as bad as 70, which will be generally OK but which can cause some colors to appear oddly. The average high pressure sodium lamps has a color rendering index of about, drumroll please. 21. Its pretty bad. Heres an assortment of colorful objects as lit by normal white light. And now, observe how they look under high pressure sodium. Ill show them as it warms up, because it demonstrates how when the sodium emission first comes into play, it is almost monochromatic. See how you can barely tell what color things are supposed to be? As the pressure broadening occurs, you can start to see color, but it is still just odd. The strangest-looking object I discovered was this can of La Croix. Take a look at this side by side. The sodium light mutes all of the color differencesin the background, and the text becomes bizzare looking. Food in general looks unappetizing under high pressure sodium lighting. Pasta and red sauce? The sauce will look more of a pukey-brown. Having some yellow tortilla chips? Yeah theyre more of a chartreuse now. Of course, their slow warm up time would be inconvenient for home use, so theyre really suited for general illumination where theyll run all night. So, street lights, parking lots, security lighting, and other dusk-to-dawn applications are where these lamps really shine. I came up with that all on my own. For these applications, theyre really great! They are very reliable, are long-lasting (24,000 hours is typical), usually have no trouble starting in the coldest of weather conditions, and also they are very color and brightness stable over their life. They will usually retain 80% of their original brightness by the time they go out. And, their color is very consistent. Youve probably seen a parking lot with metal halide lighting, another type of discharge lamp, with each fixture a different shade of purple, green, or bluish light. Sodium lights generally are all the same looking with little to no variation among them. They also benefit from being able to perform a hot restrike. See a metal halide lamp cannot be restarted until it cools down nearly completely. If theres a momentary power interruption, it may be 3 to 5 minutes before these lights can reignite, and then it will be another minute or two until the light is up to full brightness again. But high pressure sodium lamps are able to re-strike the arc just a few seconds after a brief power interruption, and they come back with nearly their peak intensity. Its actually kind of neat to see the arc form in the arc tube when a hot restrike occurs. That said, their end-of-life failure mode is kind of odd. Over time, the sodium does react with the aluminum oxide, slowly. This causes the voltage required to maintain the arc to rise as they age. At a certain point, the arc-sustaining voltage will exceed the voltage the ballast can provide, and the light goes out. But, once it cools, it can be reignited. This process is called cycling. A cycling HPS lamp will appear to start normally, but once it reaches full brightness, it goes out. After it cools, it fires up again, and then when it reaches full brightness, it goes out. This happens over and over again until the lamp is replaced. So remember, if you see a sodium light going on and off and on and off, its not the fixture at fault, it needs a new bulb. But in the end, the high pressure sodium lamp is a very efficient, very robust, and very effective light source for outdoor applications. It is also very low maintenance, with the lamps lasting about 5 years assuming an average of 12 hours daily operation. So even though their color is odd and they are slow to warm up, they still make a lot of economic sense. In recent years, the sodium vapor lamp is starting to be replaced with new LED lamps. But should they be? (yeah) Current LED technology is only about the same efficiency of old fashioned high pressure sodium. And with a commonly rated life of 50,000 hours, a drop-in replacement may only last twice as long. And with a faulty driver it may fail sooner. Well, the answer is surprisingly complicated. It turns out that lumens arent quite the objective measurement they seem to be. While the sodium light may have an efficiency of 150 lumens per watt, it might be that in nighttime conditions, only a quarter of those lumens actually mean anything to our eyes. In my next video, well talk about current research that suggests our knowledge of light sensitivity is flawed. Well also discuss the problems of light pollution and circadian rhythm disruption, and how high pressure sodium and new LED lighting solutions are both double edged swords.

For the thousands of people, Im sure, that were wondering how I got the sodium light to work in a table lamp--this ballast is wired into an extension cord.

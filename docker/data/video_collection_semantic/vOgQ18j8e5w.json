    "transcript": "it has been what feels like my entire life since i've been able to knife battle a relatively modern graphics card off of craigslist for a price that didn't produce an involuntary hara-kiriresponse but it's finally happened i bought this pretty THICK version of a gtx 1080ti for about 380 US dollars depending on the exchange rate at the time and today we're gonna admire it then we're gonna play some games on it and then we may even compare it to another graphics card *Intro Music* now this gtx 1080 ti is probably the evga card design that's produced the most inappropriate physiological response in me of pretty much any evga graphics card ever so i am very excited to have a look at it wow this is quite a limp old box that is actually really nice packaging because it's you're just shipping the graphics card in foam so it'll be nice and protected Ooo ... there it is we've still got our evga case candy now i think this really cool looking shroud design is actually plastic which does dampen my inappropriate physiological response just a little bit but it is still there because we've got one hell of a fin stack under here with those three awesome looking fans at least *tap* *tap* *tap* the back plate isn't turtle murder material so that's good that's nice and in terms of physical condition aside from being a little bit sticky this graphics card is actually in very nice condition considering that it could potentially be quite old um but yeah i'm curious to see how the temperatures hold up with this cooler now considering that the gtx 1080 ti was launched back in 2017 you'd be forgiven for thinking that it's going to start struggling with bladder control soon however with its 11 gigs of gddr5x and its many many cores and rops and things i'm sure this middle-aged man is still gonna put up quite a fight \"I may not be able to pee anymore but i can still kick your ass\" especially considering that this is the 'FOR THE WIN 3' edition which is one of the epiniest variants of the gtx 1080 ti but with that i'm going to drop it into the test system i've been using lately with a 12 400 F in it and 16 gigs of ddr4 running at 3200 megahertz now as is tradition we're starting off with gta 5 running at 1080p very high settings i really hope the 1080 ti can run this game well wow this is running extremely well um especially actually it's running too well it's running at that point where the frame rate is so high the gta 5's engine starts freaking out and then stuttering uh so actually the 1080 ti is too good at playing gta 5 at very high settings so at 1080p you should probably limit your frame rate otherwise you're going to get those stutters uh other than that though um gpu utilization utilization's not super high but you know it it doesn't really matter in this situation because again the game is running too well if anything whoa battlefield 5 a 1080p ultra settings is it's running very well uh we're also sitting at about 160 frames per second fairly similar to gta 5's frame rate although we're sitting much closer to that 100 gpu utilization which is good now what i find really interesting about this is the power draw that's hovering just under 250 watts which is a far cry from the modern higher end gpus something like an rtx 3080 ti easily draws over 350 watts while playing a game like this obviously you get more performance but still that's it's not a super high power draw by today's standards but yeah from what i've seen so far it seems like the 1080 ti is actually kind of overkill for 1080p gaming uh which is impressive for a five-year-old gpu next we're going to try a more demanding game cyberpunk which a lot of the reason why it's more demanding is just because it's terribly made but that's besides the point which at 1080p with the high preset is giving us about 70 frames per second now unfortunately one of the shortcomings of the gtx 1080 ti is that we can't enable features like ray tracing or dlss at higher resolutions uh but in terms of ray tracing i don't think that really matters to be honest but yeah this is a surprisingly good feeling playable cyberpunk experience good job middle-aged gpu wow this is clearly how fortnite's supposed to run so this is a 1080p with competitive settings and on this 240hz monitor that is some crisp movement we've got going there but anyway with that let's have a quick look at some more detailed benchmarks and then we're gonna rip off that beautiful cooler and re-paste it to see if it helps improve the temperatures at all now part of me really hopes that all i need to do is undo these four central screws to remove the cooler you know kind of like higher end asus graphics card coolers uh but i don't think that's the case i may have to undo the nine million other screws as well so fingers crossed that this cooler is as easily removable as a republic of gamer's gpu oh no that is very very very much not the case okay well i guess it's going to be a long day of screwing well it's several months later and we're finally done screwing uh hopefully it just kind of pops off now and there's not more more stuff we need to deal with uh oh the whole connectors that's very nice okay those are undone it came off really easily it's just the one that we broke oh yeah that was just mildly traumatic but we finally have our gpu revealed now around the front of the board we do have some gpu cheese going on which i find quite common with older gpus although this one does seem to have a particularly bad case of it the thermal paste application is actually not that bad but you know let's re-paste it and see what happens but look at the size of that die it's huge it's also got a real chunky power delivery where in my idiot struggling i did kind of tear the thermal pad which could be a problem because i don't think i have a replacement for that maybe it'll be fine wow that is one hell of a die damn it's thick yeah let's hope i didn't break it well i mean everything lights up which is a good start yes there we go oh no i've made it much worse somehow look at that it it's it's almost immediately jumped up to 83. 84. oh it's starting to throttle i definitely did something wrong okay so one of the fans isn't spinning i'm assuming that's the problem okay well there's your problem right there um the gpu is so hot now holy crap let me let me plug that back in and see how much that helps okay well after fixing the result of my gross incompetence we're just back to square one in terms of temperatures so that was a complete waste of time yay and then finally in a petty attempt at revenge for the 1080 ti wasting my time by having me and competently rebased it i'm going to try and emasculate this graphics card by comparing it to this which is an rtx 3060. who knows maybe this comparison will actually prove how badass the 1080 ti is but whatever happens it'll be interesting wow this is running weirdly similarly this is battlefield 5 running at 1080p ultra settings just like on the 1080 ti and uh if i couldn't see the power draw figures and the graphics card in the case i would not have known that this was a different graphics card in this system having said that i can see the power draw and it is about 100 watts lower than the power draw on that 1080 ti which that's actually quite impressive in terms of the efficiency of the 3060. having said that let's have a look at some more benchmarks to just get a fuller picture of how they stack up they do perform very similarly don't they although in most cases daddy still has a bit of an edge however baby is a lot more efficient than daddy and has a better feature set so um yes evolution i guess anyway if you enjoyed the video sub to the channel and consider watching another video a suggestion will pop up in a second and until three seconds from now thank you for watching bye",

    "transcript": "in this box fresh off of AliExpress there is a gaming laptop by a brand that definitely is an Alienware those two logos look nothing alike neither do those two and these two especially don't look like a blatantly copied homework but before we crack open this box it's time for a word from today's video sponsor that helped pay for this weirdly expensive Northern Alienware in a world dominated by garbage trash fans one fan Rises to the top with uncompromised build quality and a dedication to Performance the be quiet silent Wing fours lay waste to the competition no unicorn vomit gimmicks just silent performance and dependable reliability the be quiet silent Wing fours thank you I love how this damage on the box right over the bit telling me to report any damage on the box that's a pretty Chad move DHL see it's nothing like Alienware the name is completely different Thunder robot or is it thunderro part I'm not sure now as you can see from the specs this thunderro bot is a pretty serious not in Alienware gaming laptop so I'm excited let's open it up and have a closer look whoa there's another box inside holy crap we've gone from current minimalist logo to older glowy background logo wow this is actually quite a nice 150 watt power brick it's not very large and it's got a nice like soft rubber matte feeling to it oh and it also comes with two different power plugs as well which is quite useful damn look at that undercarriage holy crap that actually looks disappointingly unlike an Alienware laptop so disappointing in fact that it gives it a pretty serious we have Alienware at home Vibe I love that it's also called the 911. at this point I did a quick Google and it turns out Thunder robot does have a higher end model the zero which looks a lot more like an actual Alienware laptop interestingly the zero seems to be based on an Electronics laptop which I guess is how you pronounce that which supposedly is a pretty good laptop either way though I feel like this being the loser model further adds to the we have Alienware at home Vibe having said all of that I actually think it looks a bit better than an Alienware laptop it doesn't really scream gamer you know it just kind of Whispers it now in terms of build quality and material choices it's not amazing especially considering the quite premium asking price which we'll get into a bit later in the top you know you do have this top metal plate it's quite flexy though but at least it's metal and then that is bordering on some quite scratchy plastic that wouldn't feel out of place in an early 2000s Ford interior and then when you open up the laptop in here again it looks pretty nice you know I really don't think it's a particularly bad looking laptop but none of these materials feel as premium as you'd expect considering the asking price like the build feels like a laptop from several years ago in terms of the keyboard it's fine it's perfectly serviceable although I have felt better keyboards on cheaper laptops the i o is good you have enough USB ports to plug things in so that's nice you even get a full-sized ethernet port although I do wish it wasn't on the right hand side if you have it plugged in while clapping cheeks it does kind of interfere with your mouse a bit although offsetting that a bit aside from the HDMI port on the back we also have a Mini DisplayPort which is quite rare for laptops and I think that's a great addition with all of that out the way let's open up this thunder robot and have a look at the cooling solution under here which actually seems quite promising there is a lot of ventilation on the back and then we also have some copper peeking through under that ah a warranty seal nice now I am definitely a non-professional but I'm also not one to take orders from a sticker on the base of a thunder row so I'm gonna have to open it just to assert my dominance now despite there being a raised bit on the back that makes it seem like somebody wanted to put a glory hole on the back of this laptop someone stupid told them not to do it so I ended up having to undo all the screws to get the pack off initially I thought I also had to take the keyboard out to get the back off which was quite easy to do but there were no screws under there I just had to pry plastic harder there we go oh that felt really rough oh this is not a very nice laptop to open oh that's a lot of copper although we do have my favorite thing in the world under here which is downward facing speakers I just love them and next to that is a nice hole for an additional 2.5 inch drive and it actually comes with dual Channel Ram which is very exciting uh it's actually ddr4 which considering that we have a 12 700h in here is a bit disappointing for the price but it's dual channel so I can't complain too much it's got an SSD in it by a brand called SSD which is quite interesting battery wise we've got a 3500 milliamp hour battery in here in terms of the cooling solution it looks pretty good we don't have that many heat pipes but there's a lot of ventilation down here and I I think it should be fine under the naked copper we have a beefy i7 12700h and an RTX 3050. I'm not sure what the TDP of this 3050 is but again we'll find out in a a little bit actually on that note let's close this laptop up and fire it up so we can see how much VD it comes with wow that is a lame power button now we get to a very exciting bit of the video we get to see what kind of VD a thunder robot 911 from AliExpress comes with my bet though is that it probably doesn't have much VD on it control center 3.0 seems to be thunder robot specific software with like fan speed control and power modes and stuff okay we'll leave it on on entertainment for now but when we get to the actual gaming bit I'll switch it over to Performance we've also got an RGB software control Suite which looks like this so that's control center it's just got fairly generic laptop control stuff in it other than that though it's just got Windows 11 on it which shows it clearly isn't an Alienware clone considering that it's not so loaded down with venereal disease that it puts 18th century Sailors to shame anyways on that note let's try and game on the Thunder robot wow GTA 5 is running really well on this laptop obviously the fact that we have a just usable Ram configuration on this laptop Straight Out of the Box does help a lot um although the temperatures are a lot more wild especially on the CPU damn it's also so noisy this is a great example of a gaming laptop LARPing is a jet engine uh let's try a more demanding game and see how it handles that wow this laptop also runs the crap out of Battlefield 5. this is a 1080p High settings with DirectX 11 and it's sitting solidly at about 100 frames per second which again considering the RTX 3050 in here is pretty good you can see that the GPU does seem to be averaging about 65 Watts but it does jump up to 75 every now and then the display is really good it measures quite well you get about a hundred percent srgv color space coverage and it's got decent contrast for an IPS display the only anomaly is there's a lot of deviation in magenta for some reason but everything else is nice and accurate so I've been playing Battlefield 5 for a while and again the temperatures are actually doing reasonably well at the moment if you put your hand behind the back of the laptop there is a lot of air moving out and it's it's quite efficiently dissipating the heat although I just got Katana quite hard there but it is very laptop noisy like you can definitely hear it all right but with that let's move over to cyberpunk and see how it runs that with cyberpunk running a 1080p medium settings uh it's very usable we're not quite getting 60 frames per second but it feels nice and smooth the speakers are really bad even for downward facing laptop speakers it's pretty shockingly bad yeah you can barely hear the speakers over the laptop shouting that's a terrible combination bad downward facing speakers with a Ramjet laptop it means you just can't hear anything all in all not taking the price into account the definitely not an Alienware thunderro bought gaming laptop may not be crazy well built but it's pretty good the problem is I had to pay a thousand nine hundred Canadian dollars for this thing when compared to North American pricing that is way too much not even taking sales into account you can get a nicer laptop for a couple hundred dollars less the thing is there is a lot more to the world than just North America and if you're in North America you're probably not buying one of these so let me know in the comment section down below how this thunder robots pricing compares to gaming laptops in your country which brings me to the end of the video consider watching another one if you enjoyed it a suggestion will pop up in a second and until the next video bye",

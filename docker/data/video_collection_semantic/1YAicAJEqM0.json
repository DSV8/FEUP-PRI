    "transcript": "- Today is day six of the David Bombal Christmas giveaway. - Greetings from a very sunny but windy South Africa. As you may know, I like to give things away. What would you like to see in future giveaways? In this Christmas giveaway, or if it's not possible in this giveaway, in future giveaways in 2020. What would you like to win? What would you like me to give away? (upbeat music) (glass breaking) Okay so it's day six of the David Bombal Christmas Giveaway. Extremely windy here when I'm doing my recordings, I've had to redo them because I've got some extra stuff to give away. So let's start off with an Amazon eGift. I'm gonna be giving away a $200 Amazon eGift. So one person will win a $200 Amazon eGift as a thanks from me to you to say thank you for the support of this year. Really appreciate all the support you've given me. (upbeat music) Thanks to Bosan, I'm also giving away one ExSim Exam Simulation software for the CISSP Exam. If you're studying for CISSP then this software can help you. I'm also giving away one copy of the CCNA ExSim Exam Simulation software and two copies of the Boson NetSim Network Simulation software. Use this software to help you pass your CCNA exam. Great software from Boson, once again I really want to thank them for their support this year and for once again supporting me with this Christmas Giveaway. (upbeat music) Okay so I'm in a different part of South Africa. It's really hot here. Hopefully these videos will come out okay. The good news is that I've got a whole bunch of additional content and prizes to give away. So it's well worth once again adding additional videos to this Christmas giveaway because I've got a whole bunch of extra stuff to give to you. Now I've got some good news. If you're studying for the new CCNA, Cisco are sponsoring one copy of Kevin Wallace's CCNA 200-301 Complete Video Course and Practice Test. This is valued at $399. Kevin is a famous instructor in the Cisco community. You may know him already, he's a CCIE, he's also written a bunch of Cisco Press books. - [Kevin] This is going to allow us to communicate a lot more binary data with fewer waive forms. It's a lot like throwing darts at a dart board. If we hit different spots on that dart board, there are different numbers associated with those different spots, same thing here. In this example, we've got 16 dots, and we said that represented four bits. That's because two raised to the power of four is 16 and this is called 16-QAM, Q-A-M. That's quadrature amplitude modulation. It gives us 16 different targets in what's called a constellation. - So one person has the opportunity to win one of Kevin's courses, sponsored by Cisco. I really want to thank Cisco for their sponsorship of this giveaway, and their sponsorship of my channel. Now I've mentioned this in the previous video, if you're studying for your CCNA, you probably wanna join the new Cisco CCNA study group. Here's a link if you wanna join that study group. This is a place to share information with others in the community and learn from others. Okay, so I've got an additional giveaway, sponsored by Cisco. One person is gonna win access to the CCNA 200-301 Portable Command Guide, 5th Edition. If you're studying for the new CCNA, this can really help you prepare for the simulations as well as for the real world. You go through a whole bunch of commands that you need to know for the exam, as well as to help you in the real world. But hold on, before we continue, first 60 people that use this link will get free access to my Python for network engineers course. First 60 people get access to my Python course. If you're not one of those first people, then you can use the link below this video to get to the course at a discount. Okay some good news, Kevin Wallace is sponsoring one person to get access to his new CCNP ENCOR Video Training Series. It's currently in development, but will be released by the end of February, however the winner will get early access to the ENCOR training. So if you win this giveaway, Kevin will give you early access to the content so that you can start studying straight away. Full course will be released by the end of February 2020. Okay but one more thing, the first 60 people that use this link will get access to my Wireshark course. If you wanna learn how to use Wireshark practically, then use this link and get access to my Wireshark course. Now I hope that you have a fantastic Christmas, fantastic New Year. And that 2020 is a great year in your life. All the very best. (upbeat music)",

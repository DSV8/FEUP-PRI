    "transcript": "We were thinking you would be so cool if we tried to overclock at the North Pole, but the North Pole is very cold But what isn't is our environmental test chamber with the ability to go all the way from a hundred and eighty degrees Celsius to negative 40 we can test everything from your nan's cookie recipe to a computer at the North Pole So, let's see just how fast a PC can go at negative 40 degrees And if it can even survive what will survive is this segue to our sponsor build redux? Are you in the market for a new rig pick your parts and let build redux take care of the rest with? Competitive pricing compared to building a PC yourself build redux will have your dream rig shipped to your door ready to do all kinds of Computery things so check them out at the link down below Before we can take the chamber down to negative 40 degrees and chuck a PC in it We first need to heat it up. So here's the thing at minus 40 Condensation is gonna be a really big problem and although in the near future We're gonna have humidity control in our environmental chamber. We don't yet have the air compressor That's required for us to do that so instead what we can do is just heat the chamber up to remove all the moisture from the air and Then cool it down now since we needed to have the chamber heated up anyway We were curious What was the performance of a PC look like if you were to take it out of a comfortable room temperature whoa? Oh, that's spicy fast fast fast put it. Oh, sorry. Sorry. I'm putting it in I'm putting it in and put it at an insane 49.4 degrees Celsius the all-time Canadian record for highest temperature recorded in Lytton two years ago Let's get this thing hooked up. I did not orient it correctly. Yeah, we also need cables It's a whole thing. Okay, let's do it. I mean, that'll probably do right we can just take the squid over there Have we got this we also need to go we can't just go straight in We need to go over this down do a loop and then in the reason for that is that not now But later we have a lot of potential for condensation to form around here and potentially Drip down our cables and we don't want it to get onto anything that matters We want it to just drip down here around the floor this bucket. Okay. So this poor computer is running at 50 degrees right now. Oh Shut up There's a whole like web interface for it that I mean that makes sense. Yeah, so you can fully control it from here Program in routines and stuff and also see like oh we open the door there and we open the door there Wow, it actually loses less temperature than I would have thought. Yeah, it wasn't too bad. Our poor CPU is sitting at 75 degrees right now Doing nothing and what's really wild is that these temperatures aren't even unrealistic If you lived in one of the hottest regions in India For example, you could see temperatures close to this on a fairly regular basis in the summer What's our what's our planned load? Like should I just cinebench it real quick instant thermal throttle and our poor CPU is running at a mere 4.14 point one three. I mean it's well above base clock Which is kind of impressive. Oh, it's it did a burn-in test. Okay. Okay. Let's see. We're at 4.02 3.99 Man what's everything else looking like Surprisingly the motherboard VRM's are still very reasonable. Good job gigabyte, I guess GPU idling at 52 which is impressive when it's sitting in a 50.6 degree Celsius chamber Wow dipped as low as three point nine four three point nine three That explains why the motherboard VRM's aren't getting hot. Oh There's no power. They're not pushing any power through them now that we've heated up our CPU Let's get an actual score for reference. I would expect 36,000 on a computer like that. We are not getting 36,000 sir. I will eat my sandal if we get 36,000 33,000 points, but how will Nvidia fair Fer Mark you want to do Fer Mark and yes Fer Mark? Oh my god I want to run like 25 60 by 1440. That's pretty good for stress test 4x anti aliasing go Now what we're looking at on an Nvidia GPU is not the temperature because it's not going to go over 80 85 degrees They're hard limited What we're looking at is the effective clock speed because they will just throttle down their performance To match whatever they can do within that thermal target. It's doing pretty well. It's doing pretty well so far The one time that 40 90 cooler is needed that fan is running at 90 percent though We can't hear it over all the sound around us, but that thing must be freakin ripping Okay, I want to know can it can I crack it? Yeah, go can I crack it just to hear it? Okay She's gone It's hard to tell but she's definitely going it's not in real time so it might take a minute or two to show up, but yeah, we lost a Bit here Wow Alex our fan speed isn't even a hundred percent. This thing is handling it How we had a whole plan for this video where we were gonna show like dog slow performance at 50 degrees on the GPU And then we were gonna ramp it down to like, you know The average Arctic temperature in Canada negative 40 and show how it's like. Yeah It's doing it. What the heck? Okay, these coolers are so over spec'd Hold on a second 40 90 specs Founders, okay. This isn't a founders card. This is uh Looks like yeah, it's an Asus Strix card, but Realistically, they're all gonna have fairly similar environmental condition ratings I cannot find any reference to a safe environmental operating temperature for the rtx 40 90 I guess we're off the rails for the rest of this video All right I want to take this down to minus 40 it does kind of make sense that it can do this because if you think about Like a computer case you might expect it to be in 35 degrees you're pumping 450 watts into it for a while if the airflow isn't too great Right inside of the case. It might be getting to 50 very well be 510 degrees over ambient But good for good job a suits geez flipping gears then modern CPUs Particularly from Intel don't even operate at peak efficiency at room temperature. So we are expecting Ah, yes a very very different outcome almost immediately we dropped from 200 watts down to 190 and the lower that power consumption is the less of our total potential Performance that we're getting it's already dropped a full gigahertz of clock speed. That is 1 billions of clock speed Oh, wow. Yeah, this is still dropping We can give it a tiny bit longer. Sure. Now you said that until we have our compressed air set up here We are not going to be able to control humidity. I mean obviously for wetting the air. We've got this water tank So I guess the compressed air plays a role in drying the air Yeah, the compressed air goes into these desiccant chummies right here. Okay, so there you get dry air out All good. I see so it'll basically go. Oh, no, it needs to be wetter up. So it needs to be drier And that's pretty much it but you need quite a bit of pressure and a lot of CFM to Blast all the air through so we need a big air compressor got it This seems to be settled in we went from an average clock speed of four point seven gigahertz all the way down to three point Five five and our power is down from over 200 watts to just one hundred sixty now It's time to pull our temperature down to the average Arctic temperature in the winter here in Canada. Okay, I hear her doing something Hey, buddy, you okay in there now, there's a lot of Leakage so that's probably just the air blowing past the compressor Okay, which we can look at ah Also in the time that took you to go from over there to here we dropped 10 degrees Really? I Thought you said it was gonna take half an hour to pull down I guess it gets harder to pull down once the environmental temperature is higher than what it's trying to do. Yeah Wow Wow There goes another one. They're biting the dust and another one. Got you. Yeah. Sorry, okay Holy schnikes I Underestimated the size of that compressor Wait, is this a two-stage system? It looks like it but no it's not We thought we had two stages of phase change cooling one to cool down the chamber and one to cool down that stage but what we're actually looking at here is a gigantic three and a half horsepower scroll compressor and then a couple of Accumulator tanks that seem to play a role in drying the refrigerant So removing any moisture which can't be compressed and also filtering it so that it can operate as efficiently as possible Shout out Jake Danes for helping us read the schematics is our CPU seriously still at a hundred degrees on a Noctua NHD 15 It's actually really confusing because around like 15 degrees Celsius It was doing pretty good and now the clock speeds are dropping and so is the wattage So I wonder if like our thermal paste has frozen. Oh It's been at a hundred degrees the whole time. We might have just frozen our heat pipes Wait, did it just crash? Welcome back To land on the living the GPUs at negative 16 degrees on the memory I really want to check it for condensation But I don't really want to open up the door and add in a bunch of condensation. See this warm air When it touches the cold stuff We'll immediately have the moisture drawn out of it where it will collect on the cold stuff Do we continue with this computer? No, I think it's time for us to take it to another level. This is where things get really spicy Because remember that part we mentioned about how when we open it up the warm air condensation, etc We need to find a way to swap components on this bench without destroying it. We're gonna have to be really fast Okay, and once it's running through maybe it'll be fine. If it's just sitting in there. It's gonna freeze right? I'm so sorry deep cool. Thank you for sending us your all-in-one liquid cooler. I don't know Why are we just gonna wing it? Let's just open it up and see what happened. We're just gonna wing it. Ah, okay Currently minus 35 freaking cold. Okay. This is bad. It is condensing already Alex. This is very bad. Yeah Oh Also is the computer on right now Why is the computer on oh my god, it's frosting over. It's frosting over already Alex Close the door of it. Let's get yeah more more more. Oh My god, it's really bad. Sorry Andrew. You got a oh my god. This is so cold We're just gonna get the hardware after all this is bad you gotta close it more close it more shoot me through the window just I Mean here. I'm in here. It's fine Okay, I need the backplate Oh my goodness, she's frosty Alex I can tell Where's the other where's the old backplate? Oh, it fell off. Okay. Okay. You got it. I have the old backplate There's the new one. Oh Oh crap, this is bad very bad Okay, so it's just a second I need to hold this back plate on I think yeah, there it goes Okay, good work Here we go. Oh My gosh. Oh, sorry. I just elbow you in the head. Yes. Oh, sorry. That's fine Okay, is it theoretically ready to power up? Okay, we gotta close it Alex. You can't organize organized hardware in a little tray Have you gone mad sir? So the power buttons in there Oh ball. Oh god. It's at 92% humidity Alex Why did we change the cooler? I'm just here to hold the door for you. Um, it's content. Don't blow up my chamber, please. What we should have done Was brought it back up to room temperature then pulled it down again It does appear that Linus was right and there is no more frost all over our computer. Our AIO might be frozen But it should be fine. You may remember this computer from our direct dye cooling video recently Well, it's still got the same direct dye water block on it But instead of using an industrial chiller to pump fluid through the loop. We're gonna be running this inside our air chiller Yeah, I was wondering about that. So instead of using straight water We are apparently wait, is this windshield deicer or is it like all ah, perfect I expect some problems problem number the first this doesn't seem like a lot of glycol problem number the second glycol when it reaches Certain temperatures gets quite viscous. And this is just a PC cooling pump. This is not your car's cooling pump Have we crossed the line from fun to stupid? No, what would be stupid is if we didn't use this tray because if the water from our computer Gets onto that and they common ground we blow up both of them. Don't worry. Everything's fine I didn't think it wasn't but now I'm concerned. No, they're fine I'm down. Everything's fine. I'm leaving in five minutes and now I'm concerned intended Thank you. The test chamber will work when you arrive tomorrow. Oh Wow, this is just clear antifreeze Glug-glug-glug-glug-glug-glug-glug Wait, did we ever plug in the pump for the AIO in there? Yes, but also it's not working Oh, well, maybe the pumps working but either way we're at a hundred and fifteen watts right now hundred degrees on the CPU so, uh, it turns out AIO in a Minus 33 degrees not a good time. Are you prepared for a very cold looking computer? Oh, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch You doing all right? Yeah. Wow, that's very cold This will need to sit for a solid day or two before it would be safe to fire up at this point Even the air inside the CPU socket would have enough moisture in it that left like this It would be a major concern for it to be just pulled up in there. How much glycol did you get in there? I don't know. I have absolutely no way of knowing. Yeah, it'll probably be fine. All right It seems like not fine. It's kind of the theme of this video though All right That's a lot of liquid metal, all right Crap, we're gonna get that off. Oh Serious, okay I guess we haven't actually explained in this video certain thermal compounds will perform worse at lower temperatures And for those of you who are wondering what we are seriously using this equipment for That's actually the closest thing to it out of what you've seen so far is Figuring out like validating manufacturers claims about the safe operating temperatures of their equipment Okay, we going for it. Yep Wow, this is a very hard cable to move this feels like being in an arctic wind Oh my god, come on, come on Okay, oh Yes, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. We've got output. Okay So here's the thing when we were using the industrial chiller Obviously actually it has a very similar cooling capacity about 5,000 watts Yeah, but the chiller is gated. It won't go under five degrees on the coolant Theoretically with negative 40 degree air our traditional water cooler could go below five degrees We're not expecting it to simply turn to solid ice immediately But we would hope to notice though is if it was starting to solidify around the edges I think I'm starting to see a little bit of freezing on some of the tubes. It might just be external seriously Oh, no, you're right. Holy crap. That's a problem if it's around the outside. It's not too bad. I don't really inside I don't think it's the outside. I think it's the inside other CPU doing 100 degrees at the entrance to that radiator There's already ice The wildest thing is that that might have been because of CPU over temperature it was only at like 80 watts on the CPU and a hundred degrees like That could have actually been our problem and I don't know why Can't turn back on. You know, it can turn on though this segue to our sponsor XSplit.

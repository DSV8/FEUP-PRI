    "transcript": "Now that weve looked at how rice cookers work, its time to get back to the CED. Yes, we are now on Part 5 of this three-part series at some point this series will be over. Will this be the video that concludes it? Well, at the time that Im writing these words, it looks like it. But we wont really know until we get to the end, will we? So, lets not beat around the bush and get right to it. As a refresher, the CED is RCAs ultimate exercise in beating around the bush. An idea first conceived in the mid 1960s, but ultimately delayed into the 1980s, and delayed for a ton of reasons mostly to do with mismanagement and corporate politics. Im gonna put these away now.... We left the story in the year Stars and Stripes Forever when Edgar Griffiths, a videodisc naysayer, took the helm at RCA. Things didnt look too great for the project, especially because their Japanese competition was beginning to heat up. But lets not talk about that, lets go back to 1974. Uh-oh, here comes a twist! Back in 1974, RCA had sent representatives to Japan to try and license their videodisc technology to Japanese manufacturers. Now, you might be saying to yourself, really? Didnt you just say something about the Japanese being competition? Wasnt it the case that they didnt have anything to do with the CED? Well, in the end, this was largely true. But initially, RCA was trying - hoping - to establish their soon-to-be-called CED as a unifying standard in the industry. They offered really generous terms to various Japanese companies, hoping that they could get lots of third-parties involved and avoid a potential format war. There were a couple of big problems, though. First, these demonstrations in Japan didnt go so well. The demonstration units burned through playback styluses like there was no tomorrow, and the discs were extremely hit-or-miss. To those within RCA who had expressed doubts in the system, uh this only strengthened those doubts. And frankly, they saw the performance of the system in Japan as an embarrassment. The second big problem? Well, RCA wouldnt find out about that for a little while. But, suffice it to say they let the cat out of the bag, and way too early. They werent anywhere near done ironing out the kinks, and the Japanese knew that. Matsushita specifically expressed concerns about the disc manufacturing process, and had even suggested that RCA set up a manufacturing plant in Japan to help take care of that problem. With suggestions like that, it sure seemed like Matsushita was on RCAs side. I mean, theyre being so helpful! They were among six companies that had taken RCA up on their incredibly generous deal. For just $3,000, RCA sold them a prototype player, sample discs, and engineering drawings. Whether this generosity was out of desperation or whether RCA was perhaps irresponsible is unclear, but in any case, Matsushita signalled that they were all in, and they began doing their own work on the concept. We are going to return now to the year Stars and Stripes Forever when Griffiths (who remember did not care for this project) was now in charge of RCA at large. But one thing that you should know is that JVC, thats the Japan Victor Company, funnily enough born from the Victor Talking Machine Company and thus at one point owned by RCA (at least until World War II broke out), was at this time owned by Matsushita. Interestingly, Graham refers in her book to Matsushita as being JVCs parent company, and ehhh Im not sure thats really the best way to put that. Wikipedia simply says they were the majority stockholder, and Panasonics own website (Panasonic is the main consumer-facing brand of Matsushita in the US) says they formed a capital alliance with JVC in 1954. In any case, Matsushita and JVC were good buds! Remember that. Up till now, RCA had learned that basically everything they were doing wasnt working. The auto-coater didnt improve disc yields at all. The discs were still wicked fragile. Labs and the consumer division in Indianapolis still werent working together all that well. And in general, it looked like Griffiths had plenty of reasons to just axe this project. This was when Griffiths commissioned that report comparing it to Betamax which you may recall from the last episode. And heres where things stood. Richard Sonnefeldt, who was the head of the videodisc project, argued that if they pulled out of videodisc, it would be strike three for the company. Already their image wasnt great what with all the terrible business they had been doing, and they announced both Holotape and Magtape without actually delivering. If they couldnt move on this third incarnation of SelectaVision theyre out. Moreover, the promises they had made to their Japanese investors were presumably still good. If they moved forward they could get perhaps $100 million in licensing revenues. Even if the product ultimately failed, they could still have some sort of licensing from other patents. Sonnenfeldt made the case that having come this far, it would be silly to quit. And he believed that, given the progress they had made, they could get it out in April of 1978. But that was still a ways off. And the Japanese were encroaching on RCA not only with video recorders, but also with consumer electronics in general. No longer was buying a color television a choice between RCA and Zenith. Now theres Sony, Panasonic, and Hitachi, among others. They were being squeezed out on all sides, and their existing dealer network was getting tired of the situation. When it came time to make the final decision, Griffiths gathered all 17 managers of the Videodisc project for a vote. Should we proceed? Or should we cut our losses? The vote was 1 in favor of withdrawal, 5 abstaintions, and eleven votes to continue. Griffiths agreed to keep going, but as a compromise measure, they would enter into negotiations with Sony and Matsushita to produce a videotape recorder that they could market through their dealer network. And THATs how the SelectaVision name ended up on VCRs from Matsushita before it ended up on their own damn product. Side-note, this is unrelated to the CED story, but since its come up in the past on this channel, I feel I cant ignore the fact that right here, in this very meeting, the fate of the videotape format war was essentially sealed. Matsushita gave more favorable terms to RCA than Sony, and importantly they went along and bodged a long-play recording mode for them which Sony wasnt willing to do. RCAs decision to go with Matsushita and the VHS format is likely the single most important event in the entire format war. In the years that followed, Griffiths became somewhat of a convert. Perhaps the result of a critical mention in a Fortune magazine article, or possibly in an effort to convince the folks at labs that he wasnt against them, Griffiths became gung-ho on making Videodisc happen. And progress was happening. They still hadnt figured out the keys to everything, but their 1977 technical checkpoint went pretty well. Plus, they had demonstrated their system to GE and it seemed like they might be interested in working with RCA. It began to look like maybe, just maybe, RCA could get other American companies to follow their lead. And then they returned to Japan to follow-up with their partners over there when they were completely blindsided. JVC had been lurking in the background this entire time, and they had created a working videodisc made without a complicated coating and mastered using a simple optical method. This disc seemed to be almost in all respects better than what RCA was working on. Some of you may have already guessed that this disc is what would eventually go on to become the VHD, or Video High Density format. This new format was very similar to the CED. In fact, one might say, suspiciously similar. If youd like to learn more about this format you should check out Techmoans video on it. Ive linked it down below. Now RCA was kinda forked, here. You see, this new system, while pretty clearly inspired by RCAs ongoing efforts, was substantially different in many respects. This meant RCA probably couldnt get any sort of licensing revenue out of JVC, at least not anything significant. Whether or not JVC had stolen RCAs idea by way of Matsushita is unclear, but I mean that would be one hell of a coincidence, wouldnt it? RCA had now lost not only their competitive advantage from proprietary disc mastering and manufacturing, but also any hope of unifying everyone under the same technical standard. Not good. Suddenly, it was a race against time on all sides. Sonnefeldt realised that JVC and Matsushita could just come out with a videodisc format of their own without warning. Philips/MCA were now pushing DiscoVision as a consumer format, and thats looking like its gonna launch soon. And this whole time, videocassette recorders are getting super popular, and although RCA is selling tons of them, theyre actually buying them from who could soon be their main competitor in the videodisc space! Its jus. AHHHH! 1977 was the year that RCA decided they would pretty much just start over. The labs and consumer division relationship was still not fantastic, and at this point the labs were mostly cast aside. Indianapolis would now be put in charge of figuring out how to make this work, and the labs would basically be there for support. The first task at hand was to figure out how to make the discs using JVCs techniques. You may recall that at this point RCA was using injection molding for the discs, which is NOT how conventional audio records are produced. JVCs videodisc prototype used plain, uncoated, stamped discs, and RCA recognized this was a better and more cost-effective idea. So, if JVC had stolen their basic concept, well now RCA stole their improvements so I guess theyre even now. The switch to conventional record-stamping was not only simpler but also, just, worked better. Discs yields were way up and equipment costs and complexity were way down. Perhaps they should have thought to try that themselves like, forever ago. They also developed the electromechanical mastering process, which also is incidentally pretty much exactly how conventional audio record stampers are produced. They also switched to a diamond stylus from the sapphire that they had been using, and this increased playback stylus life tenfold. OK, I need to interject here with some commentary. 1977 was the year this finally started to come together, and yet, all these breakthroughs were hardly breakthroughs at all! Now, sure, Im oversimplifying, but honestly everything that just happened could be boiled down to; well what if we just tried making discs like audio records? And what if we just tried a diamond stylus, like many record players have? Treating the CED like the glorified audio record it was fixed a lot of problems. Sure, they needed to innovate some of the specifics, and coming up with the actual formulation of PVC which would allow the disc to be conductive was an entirely new innovation, in my eyes. But seriously. So much progress was made in this one year by attacking the problem with already existing techniques. To me, this is the biggest piece of evidence that the Labs was arguably more of a hindrance than they were a resource. Given that the people working there liked to research shiny new phenomena and publish their findings, it seems pretty unlikely that anyone there would have said well, what if we just iterated on the technology we already understand? In fact we know this wasnt their cup of tea, given how everyone there flocked to Holotape rather than what would become the CED. This rapid progress didnt happen until Indianapolis was given the lead, and the pressure of restricted budgets caused them to consider tried-and-true methods of the past. And these happened to work. And really well. This just goes to show that a bunch of bright minds in one place isnt necessarily a recipe for success unless theyre working towards a common goal. The Labs didnt see themselves as working on the Videodisc, they were a research institution! And everyone in the labs had their own pet projects, so of course they were gonna push for those to be incorporated into whatever the consumer divisions were working on. It took me until I re-read this section of the book to realize how absurdly complicated some of their ideas were. What place do electron beams have in making a disc stamper? Why the hell wouldnt you just do what youve been doing for decades and physically cut the master? Well, unless somebody asks that question, nobodys gonna try. And if your job is to think up new things, youre probably not gonna ask that question. The people in Indianapolis werent trying to blow the minds of the world with new discoveries. They were just trying to make the damn product work. And once they were given the lead, suddenly a lot of pieces fell into place. Funny what can happen when your division shares a common goal. If 1977 was the year of figuring out the obvious, 1978 was the year of lets get going, shall we? As predicted, Matsushita decided that they would rather back this new thing JVC was working on, so there went any hope of having them as a partner. Adding to that pain was the fact that currency fluctuations now meant RCA couldnt make much money on the VCRs they were importing from Matushsita, and their hopes of importing Japan-made videodisc players of their own format pretty much dried up. It became clear that if this system was to have any chance of success, RCA would just have to do it themselves. And so, they did. Now that they had, like, a plan, Laboratories came back into the fold to work on specifics like figuring out how to mass produce components and whatnot. And Indianapolis played a bigger role than ever. The various pilot tests that they had done over the years were always being handled by a scrappy team at the Rockland Road facility, and now that team would grow to about 300 people in preparation for launch. Luckily, this went pretty smoothly all things considered. Thanks to the fact that they had cracked the code using nothing but [through clenched teeth] modified record stamping equipment, it wasnt that hard to procure the equipment and start production. Plenty of companies made that sort of stuff. If only they hadnt been trying to reinvent the wheel [thorugh more intensely clenched teeth] for the past decade. The new conductive PVC formulation eliminated the need for the auto coater which had caused tremendous problems in each pilot program, and really all they needed to do now was get a catalogue of programs ready to go, and start pumping out players and discs. Unfortunately, the stars were not aligned. Before launch, videodiscs were getting bad press thanks to reliability problems with the early Discovision players. And the economy was heading into a recession. And GE announced that they intended to back JVCs system. And IBM had backed Discovision. And videocassette recorders were getting cheaper and were selling like hotcakes. And nobody wanted to work with RCA. So, alone, battered, and afraid, the system finally launched in March of 1981 to little fanfare. Of course, RCA would add their own fanfare in 1982 RCA's incredibly confident fanfare for the CED plays buh dah dah dah dah dah dah daaaaaah daa daa dummm BWAH DO DO DO DOOOOO DUMMM but that wouldnt help. [that cut was bloody perfect, wasn't it?] Not even RCAs dealers were interested in pushing this product, as they had had their hands full with VCRs for the past 4 years. Two thirds of the dealers who had signed on to sell the videodisc had backed out, and that alone may have been enough to seal its fate. But even had that not happened, its important to remember that the VCR was in nearly every respect a better, more capable, and more convenient product. The only advantage RCA had with their videodisc was cost, but that would only remain true if the consumer attitude was to A) see no reason to record live TV and B) wanted to buy lots of pre-recorded content. And of course the thing that RCA didnt see coming was rental. I went over this in much greater detail in my series on Laserdisc, but an important thing to consider here is that RCA developed this product before home video existed as a concept. You could argue they were trying to invent that concept, but unfortunately they were catastrophically late. If the CED had managed to be on the market before the VCR had made much headway, Id wager that it would have been tremendously successful. If they had made even their 1977 deadline, the choice would have been between a $400 machine with $15 movies and a $1300 machine which could record live TV. That makes the value proposition of the CED player much more compelling. But by 1981, not only had people been watching the price of VCRs steadily decrease through four years of intense competition, but they could also witness this home video rental market start to appear. Now, if they bought one of these VCRs, they would not only be able to record live TV, but theyd have access to a large library of content. And sure, mass producing pre-recorded videocassettes was a slow and expensive process, but who cares if a videotape of your favorite movie costs $75 to buy if you can rent it for $3? Also of note is the fact that you could get practically anything on videocassette, but your choices on CED were limited to what RCA could cobble together. They struggled to provide a wide library of programming, and since relatively few people bought the machines, even though disc sales exceeded expectations, they could never justify expanding production all that much. To their credit, though, they did manage to have a remarkably large library when you consider only half a million players ever existed. But there was still a lot they just couldnt offer. And, uh, well one of the things they didnt offer was shall we say mature content. Graham mentions this mostly in passing as an example of the lack of programming variety, and I dont believe shes suggesting that this would have saved the videodisc. And hey. Before this gets brought up, because of course it will now that Ive said this, porn existed on Beta tapes, OK? That whole explanation of Beta losing the format war because Sony wouldnt allow porn is nothing but an urban legend, and we know this because not only was there Beta in the back room, but because Sony didnt have control over what was being put on their tapes. Neither Betamax nor VHS were created to sell content. Let me repeat that. Neither Beta nor VHS were created to sell content. JVC and Sony werent in the distribution business, and they were not greenlighting anything at all. Im only bringing this up because RCA WAS in the distribution business, and it IS the case that RCA was unwilling to put their name on naughty movies, and since they were distributing literally all of the content available for their players, the only way wed have gotten that kind of Discpix would be if third party manufacturers appeared. Which of course didnt happen because the volumes just werent there. This almost makes me wonder if the origins of that VHS myth might be traced back to the CED, because that story is what literally happened in the case of RCA. The real head-scratcher about the entire CED ordeal is the why. Why did RCA continue with this in the face of so much competition? Why did they think it could work? Well, thats a complicated issue. In many respects, the CEDs role in the company continually shifted. Conceived as the sequel to color television, SelectaVision would have undoubtedly been tremendously successful had it been released in the 1960s. But that didnt happen, and in the meantime priorities at RCA had changed. Consumer electronics had stopped being the primary business by the time David Sarnoff had stepped down. The diversification into computers, and of course all the other businesses they had been gobbling up under Robert Sarnoffs questionable leadership, meant SelectaVision was now just one of many projects going on. And since Labs was allowed to pursue three different methods at once, and the consumer divisions were also just doing their own thing with Magtape, there was never a real coordinated effort to make it work. So it just floundered in the background. Forever. By the time RCA had become re-focused on their goals after their computer division sell-off, it was arguably too late already. Real progress didnt happen until VCRs were already on the market. And the sad irony is that RCA knew they couldnt afford to ignore that, hence the deal with Matsushita. If theres one thing I can glean from this situation, its that the CED was viewed as a last hurrah. A chance to return RCA to its roots of a consumer electronics powerhouse, and to open up new business as a new kind of media company--not television, but SelectaVision. Of course, it failed catastrophically. In the very beginning, RCA had made a series of key assumptions that, if held true, would probably mean the success of the CED. These were that consumers would prefer a lower price to more features, that potential format confusion could be alleviated by their dealers, and most importantly that videocassette recorders would remain expensive because economies of scale apparently dont apply to magnetic tape for some reason. And also, of course, that consumers would want to own a library of video, just as they had amassed their libraries of music on LPs. Nobody ever challenged these assumptions. And that was quite foolish. In 1972 those assumptions would almost certainly hold up. And perhaps they still rang true in 1977. But RCA seemed unwilling to acknowledge the changing landscape. Consumer electronics was starting to become the way it is today, with intense competition pushing the boundaries of features and price at an incredible pace. It seems RCA was just unaware of this new reality. Four years wasnt a long time to wait in the 1960s. But by the late 70s it certainly was. Yet they still tried. In summary, a bunch of things doomed this poor product. The free-rein that Labs was given to just do whatever with little regard to practical matters prevented progress from ever being truly coordinated, as did the general resentment of the labs by other departments. So years passed without anything to really show for it. Then, RCA had lost their way under Robert Sarnoff and just kinda stopped innovating altogether for a while. And by the time Griffiths was in charge, they had just kinda forgotten how to innovate. Griffiths made an earnest attempt in the late 70s to take RCA back to its roots and become a true innovator once more. He brought back the His Masters Voice tagline, long ago abandoned, and he really tried to get RCAs reputation back on good footing. And I think it says a lot that real progress was made once the folks in Indianapolis were essentially leading the project. That team over there worked like RCA of old, and they actually got results. It was just too late to make much of a difference. RCA had a lot of debt to cover by the time 1984 rolled around. The CED had failed spectacularly, so there goes any chance of this covering it, and while they did have some strategies going for how to get out of that debt, in the end they just couldnt make it. GE bought what was left in 1986, and sold off many of those assets in the years to come. Given how it panned out, the CED literally was RCAs last hurrah. Is the failure of the CED what ultimately killed RCA? Well, not from a pure numbers sense, no. There were far too many things going on at RCA for the failure of one product to sink the ship. But I think its fair to say it was the final nail in the coffin. A lot was riding on the success of the CED. Literally the entire company. Had it gone according to plan, I think RCA would still be around. But lets be honest. It needed to be out about 6 years earlier if it were really going to work. Well. Thats it. Weve finished the series, and I hope you enjoyed it! Id like to mention here that RCA is dead. But the brand lives on as one of those brands that doesnt actually mean anything at all. You might find an RCA-branded whatever on store shelves but lets be real. Its probably crap. Maybe youll find the odd gem here and there but seriously, its not like the legacy of David Sarnoff lives on in this countertop dishwasher. Oh, and one other thing. While this officially ends the series, it was suggested to me that I could follow-up on some of the unanswered questions you may have regarding this disastrous format. For example, some people have wondered if you can insert the disc into the caddy upside down. Well, you can! At the edge of the spine theres a little side indicator, so that is really what tells you which side is which. I would imagine most people were careful to make the sides match the label, but there is indeed nothing stopping you from putting the caddy in upside down. If theres anything youd like to know about the CED that I havent covered, please leave a comment! Of course, a huge thank you to the people who support this channel through Patreon. Without your support I couldnt spend so much time on big long series like this, so thank you! You can join these folks if you like through the link on the endscreen or in the description. Thanks for your consideration, and Ill see you next time! disastrously smooth jazz We are done! The series is over! Yeah! *inhales* no. Hoping that they could sell beh bu ba da daba da dubba da Well in the end, this was large-ly true. But initially. Why did I say largely like that? They offered really generous terms to various Japanese companies hopening hopening? This is not going well, this is gonna take forever! I have to get the book which I left upstairs. Hang on. Got it! Side-note, this is unrelated to the CED story but since it comes up in the (awkward pause) since its come up. Its as in its has it has. Disc yields were way up and equispment equispment? And importantly, they went along and made for them (another awkward pause) Skipped a line The various ta.. buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh That would only remain true if consumer attitudes were to A) (snaps fingers) What was that line? That would only remain true if the consumer attitude if THE consumer attitude. OK. Griifiths made (clears throat) Griffiths made a Griffiths is a hard name to say.

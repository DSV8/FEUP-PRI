    "transcript": "- This is take one of August 18th Mystery Tech. (clapper board claps) - [Matt] Austin, what do you got there? No, no, no, what do ya got there? - This? - [Matt] Yeah. - This is the clapper board. - [Matt] Look at how ratty and out of date it is. - Yeah, this piece of paper - [Matt] It looks awful. - This piece of paper is about five years old, but it's been on like every shoot for the last five years. So we can sync it up perfectly. Oh, it's already open. - [Matt] Well, sort of. I just had to see what it was. - So you've pre-unboxed a Mystery Tech item, wow! - [Matt] Sometimes I like to get a little sneaky peaky. - Sometimes one of the items falls out of the box by accident, and it rolls into my apartment. - Interesting. - A lot of packaging here, and there's also a marker. Oh, is this a new slate? - [Matt] Why would you even think that? - Okay. It's E-Ink? Wait, that's way over the top! But most important thing with any slate, how does it sound? (slate clicking) - [Ken] Cute. - No, no, no, no! - [Matt] That is adorable. - Matt, would you like to fill us in? How much is the TRIBE7? - I wanna say like 300 bucks. - Oh, that's actually not as much as I thought it'd be. Like slates can cost a thousand bucks. - No, no, no, but those slates actually have like time code and stuff, this is - [Ken] Does this have time code? - [Matt] Oh, uh-uh-uh. - What's the point? (Ken laughing) - I thought it was smart! - Alright, so here's a template. Hold your device near the slate. Oh, wait, wait, wait, hold on, this is actually kinda cool. Oh, alright! You know what? I take back some of the mean things I said. - [Ken] Overclock Media, look at that! - Probably should have inverted it, but there we go. We're now ready for our next segment of Mystery Tech. (slate clacking) (box whooshing and thudding) (Austin cheering) This looks expensive. - [Ken] It is. Robosen \"Transformers, more than meets the eye.\" (box thudding) (Ken chuckles) What the (quack) is that? (box thudding) What? So this one's $700. What's this one? And what's the giant one? - [Alex] The small one you have in your hand is the Bumblebee version. That's a robot. It doesn't transform, but it's still like, it does all the robot kind of stuff. - Oh, okay. - That's $400. - And what is this nonsense Roboraptor knockoff? - [Alex] He is $1,700 and will be released sometime in the fall. - Can I just say thank you to Robosen for providing these samples for review? Because if these guys had actually spent $3,000 on robots, I would've transformed into a (dolphin cackle) - [Ken and Kinsey] Whoa, whoa, whoa. - [Alex] There is a transformer that can turn into [censored]. - Oh really? - Yeah - Oh, how convenient. I need that one. Look at that. Look how cool this box looks. It's all like transforming from black to purple. Whoa. God, I feel like I am the least qualified person on earth to do this right now. Okay. - Speaking for all the Transformers nerds out there. - Yeah. - They're foaming at the mouth that you have these and you don't care. - I, that's why I feel bad. Let's take a look at Bumblebee first. Ah, okay. - Hey, that's kind of neat. - Alright - Optimus Prime is, wait, what? Oh, you actually have to assemble him. - Wait, no, he's in his truck mode. - Oh, he's already in truck mode. I see. It's like, this is definitely gonna be sitting like at like a comic shop or something. It's gonna be sitting on the top shelf collecting dust for like years until some nerd walks in and buys it for like five grand. Behold. My friends. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh For context, he a big boy. So I believe that we are ready to begin. I have downloaded an app for each of them. So let's start out with Bumblebee. Connect. - Bluetooth connected. - Is it that easy? You just download the app and just connect it. I didn't even need to make an account or anything. Yes. So I've got remote control, create, action, download center, and mini theater. Let's do mini theater. - [Ken] The intricacy in the movements is so good. - So I think I have like weapons for him. I should have probably put in his hands. Oh yo, what? My dude. - I do anything to protect my friends. - I wouldn't, can I just mention Bumblebee is just in his idle animation right now. - He's chilling. - He's just chilling. So we've got the same thing; Missions, remote control, actions. Let's do missions. - [Ken] What? - [Kinsey] Yo! - Oh, whoa. We gotta try the big guy. We gotta try Grimlock now. If that's how cool Optimus Prime is. Okay. We're about to transform him. Ready? - Oh my. - Oh. - It's extinction time. - He's got so much detail. Holy. - Alright. - He is now armed. Let's do it. (laser gun shooting) You're dead now. So, sorry. You're, you're all, you're all gone. It's the moment we've all been waiting for, Roboraptor versus this poser, this defender of the robo sword dudes. - Roboraptor, okay buddy, you got this okay. You got 'em on the ropes. You just gotta take 'em. Ah, gotta watch out behind you. Watch you behind you, he's transforming. No! - It's extinction time. (all laughing) - Maybe we'll live to fight another day my dude. Okay, is that my Taco Bell hat? And that's my, wait, okay. What is going on? Wait. - Okay - I did not realize what this was when you threw it, I thought it was a light 'cause it says like RGB on it, but also says it's two watt, but it's a, it's a head. Oh! Is this just a mannequin head? Boy. Alright, we're gonna plug this in, and - You just change the color. - If you two would like your own weird IKEA disembodied, glowing head 'cause that's a item that's popular enough to live at IKEA. Have fun. I 75% caught the Walkman, I've got a lot of questions. And I think we're gonna go on this journey together. What the hell is APE, that's a supported format is APE. - Oh that, is that - That's, so it's, it's proprietary audio compression under the Monkey Audio source code license. - Get it, ape, it's a monkey - Which was like, I think Sony was really the only company that used it. What? - My boy, ready to listen to some music with me. Alright, let's take a look. Oh, it's actually, okay, well I ripped the package immediately. This is actually really tiny. So my first question is, why the hell do you want this? But this is significantly smaller than even something like my beloved iPhone Mini. I mean, you can see the Mini's not a big phone but this thing is absolutely tiny. So we've got a ton of buttons on the side. We've got power button, volume up, volume down, play, pause, forward, back. We've got a little hold button. Wow. Device is starting. So it's a proper little Android guy. That's cute. So you've got Chrome, the Play Store, a big ol' widget and a bunch of wiggly wiggly bits. Alright, so I'm gonna listen to this on my CD900ST's. - My CD900ST's - Ken's CD900ST's that he used my credit card to buy. So this is Daft Punk in hi-res, lossless audio. Okay. So I mean, obviously a huge chunk of what I'm listening to right now are the headphones, which I have listened to these in the past. They're very nice. But hi-res lossless audio is great. I'll actually play with some of the modes though. Alright, so the vinyl processor is on. Yeah, that vinyl processor actually sounds nice. It like warms up the music, There is a game of love, there is a game of love If you're an audiophile, there's a lot to like with some of the stuff that you can do here. - Three hundred and forty nine bucks. - Okay, Hmm. I think this is one of those things that's a little bit of an irrational purchase. You do not need a Walkman. No one needs a Walkman in 2023. - I do. - Besides Ken. But you're buying into this because you want to experience music in a different way versus your phone and Bluetooth headphones like everyone else. Okay. This is small. I like it. Small things are my thing. Hmm. I like, smaller thing. Um. (loud beep) Anyway, this is the, Ortomi. This is totally 3D printed. Like you can literally see the layers of the 3D printer. So we've got a USB-C port, we've got a little switch. And then an LED. Is this just like a little 3D printed friend? - You need those? - I do, 'cause I have to pay all my friends right now. Well, let's plug our little guy in and see what happens. Do I need to read the manual? 'cause my little dude's not turning on. I mean, there's a red light. It's clearly doing something. Okay. I'll read the owner's guide. Congratulations on adopting your very own Ortomi. Use the switch located at the back, to turn it on. Switch to the right or off. So I'm gonna switch to the right. Okay. It doesn't, it doesn't tell me why is he not on? Hey little buddy. You're trying to tell me that my new friend is not even here. This is the Ortomi, oh. Wait, what? We already did this one. - But - But what? It didn't work. - Correct. - So you bought another one? - Until now. - Alright, let's fire it up, and it works. Alright, what's up Ortomi? How, how do I do this? Oh, I can pet him. Okay. - Okay. Okay. - That was aggressive. - Well, well, yeah. What, what do you - I'm petting my Ortomi. - That's not - Oh he's dizzy. I pet him too hard. Oh I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, look, he's happy now. I'm not sure how he knows this, but he's, he's very happy. - He ticklish? - Tickle, tickle, tickle. Oh, he likes it. Oh, he likes, oh. - Oh no. Oh. Oh no. - Oh. Oh. He's reading now. What the? - He likes that a little too much from behind. - You know what? Here on Mystery Tech, we learn a lot of things. We learn that some things are mysterious some things are tech. Some things work and some things don't. And I think I accidentally made that sound like a Dr. Seuss rhyme. But we're gonna roll with it. Sony, is this the PS6? - Nah it's a little small for the PS6. - Is it the PS6 Slim? - No. - Oh, I know what this is. This is the Mocopi thing? - Yes. - Okay. Which, there's a bunch of sensors that allows you to Vtube. Is that a good way to describe if I described anything so far? - Well I think you can just generally describe them as motion trackers. And then - Yep - The application could vary depending on what you want to do. - So, you open it up and it's got some little trackers. So we've got a head, hip, left right wrist, left right ankle. So that seems pretty straightforward. Oh, okay. And then like, I mean, it guess makes sense. Got little straps so you can strap up and get yourself virtualized. How much is this? Do you know? - So this is $449. - Oh - But - Oh, that's lots of money. - Well it is and it isn't. - Okay - So compared to something like, you know full Vive VR you know, sets that do full body tracking. This is actually a cheaper alternative, it undercuts at least by half. - Pair each sensor with your smartphone via Bluetooth. - These trackers are quite nice. They're magnetic and they just kind of snap into place. So, yep, that is correct. So we're gonna pair with the first sensor. So you're gonna have to pair six devices to your phone. - Yeah. - But it also happens pretty quick too. - Okay. This is probably the most seamless Bluetooth experience I've ever had. There we go. Okay. We are connected. Update the firmware. Oh no, we'll be right back 'cause that's a lot of loading bars to go through. Okay. So head sensor going on. I don't think this is really meant to be used with jeans, I'll just tell you 'cause it feels like it's quite, - Yeah you really should put 'em on the inside but whatever. - Yeah. Okay. Hey, calibrated. Okay, cool. Aye, aye, aye, aye yo, aye yo you're lookin' what sorry, that's, that's me. - So in theory, if you step over here, so we can actually - Oh, there. - Yeah, so you're, you're like right there. So if you do the action, it's like you're there. So we can just pretend that, you know Austin is like kind of just the character. - I have no idea. I can't see anything, but I'm assuming it looks really cool. - It actually kind of does and the AR works pretty well too. It even adds a shadow in the background. - Ah, no, don't, get off of me. No, this is too much. - We having smooches? - No, if you don't love me for the real me, you don't get to love me for the virtual me. - Okay. - Is this our first fight? - You're damn right. You know, I haven't felt anything for minutes, in my heart. - Oh, now you know how I feel. - This is unacceptable, I'm leaving. - Oh, just go back to your mother's - That actually kinda worked. - Here, if you want, if you wanna watch it back? - No, I don't, I don't actually wanna watch that.",

Getting into a wreck would not be a comfortable experience, as you can see from this video. The Airbag launches the iPhone 6 quite a far distance.   Watch Brians video where we LAUNCH A TURKEY!:   Brian has been repairing vehicles on his channel 'BriansMobile1' for years! He is the one that opened my eyes to the world of YouTube. Look for your own way to 'Decrease World Suck' and make the world a better place! Whether its entertaining, teaching, or just vlogging your life. Everyone has something to share.   Obviously detonating airbags outside of the vehicle is pretty dangerous. So I do not recommend attempting any of this on your own.

    "transcript": "So 4 years ago my jeep broke down and it was going to cost 1,000 dollars to fix. So I looked on YouTube and found a video that showed how to fix my jeep for 80 dollars instead of 1,000. The guy who made that video 4 years ago is right here. Brian, what are we doing today? [Brian] Today were going to send a cell phone and a turkey the size of a human head airborne using an airbag out of a Mazda and a Honda. [Zack] Alright, lets get started! [Intro] [Zack] Alright Brian so were blowing up airbags. How does this work? [Brian] So the airbags really simple, its an explosive charge. It explodes into a bag and just rips through the front cover. You have two wires that youre dealing with. You can see Ive got some special terminals for probing or testing. But you have a red wire and a white wire. A positive and a ground. And basically theres an igniter behind this that will set off a charge. So Im going to take my orange wire, put it in with the red. Then the black wire into the white. And then were going to set the cell phone on it. And then Ive got some speaker cable to keep us a safe distance from the truck cuz I dont want to lose my truck doing this but I do want to entertain some folks. Maybe well lose a phone and a turkey. Thats acceptable. [Zack] So this is the cell phone that were going to use. This is an iPhone 6. Its actually locked and the screen is cracked so its not worth very much. Im going to plant it on top of the airbag. Alright, so Brian weve got the airbag right here and it looks like this is just what is coming out from inside of the steering wheel. So now the steering wheel goes around the airbag. So how does the airbag work? [Brian] In a car its a lot more complicated, you have the airbag computer, you have sensors and theres a lot of if this, then this type of programming on the computers so that your airbag doesnt deploy and cost your insurance company a bunch of money if youre going 5 miles an hour in the parking lot or something like that. And airbag like this new from Honda would probably be like 500 bucks or something like that. You can get them from the wrecking yard for about 100 bucks50 bucks. You know, so there are a lot of options where you can repair the car. [Zack] So how many sensors are there on a car usually, like inside of the bumper and on the sides? [Brian] Most cars will have sensors in the front bumper, at least one if not two. Like a Chevy pickup truck or something will have a couple up front if its in the late 90s. It just depends on the car. German cars, theyll have sensors all over the place and airbags all over the place. My truck that you see over there, its got airbags in the side curtains, in the front, you know, both sides and its got all kinds of sensors and wiring. Like explosive charges on board with that, if youre counting airbags, there are at least 6 of them, I believe. So, its a lot of explosives on board that you dont really think about. [Zack] Lets see how far this baby flies. And we have these wires right here leading up to inside of the truck. And Spencer, whats going on right here? [Spencer] So its not live right now, but we have it hooked up to the battery and once I touch this wire right here, just like that, it will shoot off the airbag. [Zack] Threetwoone [Classical music playing] [Zack] Nice. So how high do you think that got Brian? [Brian] Id say 30 feet. [Zack] 30 feet? [Brian] I was expecting more. [Zack] The airbag started off right here next to the sandbag and it jumped actually all the way over here. So this is what an airbag looks like after its deployed. It looks weve got some smoke coming out of it. Nice. [Brian] Some of that will be talc powder. [Zack] Whats the talc powder for inside of it? [Brain] Like if you want something to deploy smoothly and not snag on itself, you do the talc powder. If you want a book page to open to a certain page, you can talc powder the pages and anytime you open the book it will just automaticallycuz it, you know, theres not the friction there with the powder. [Zack] So it looks like the center of the steering wheel just opened up right along that crease. It just blew up that center seam. And this bag feels like nylon. It feels kind of like a canvas tarp. So the airbags here and the phone is about 30 feet in this direction. Oh no. We got some more damage to the screen. Good thing I know a guy who can fix phone screens. So we lost a lot of energy during the last explosion because the airbag actually hopped up off the ground. So were going to take some wire this time around and strap the airbag to the sandbag so that it wont lose as much energy, and all of the energy will be transferred to the phone launching it up into the air. The phone is still working. I mean it was a little bit broken before. Oh look dude, the phone is bent. Like its bent [Brian] from the compression from pushing it back. I kind of thought that would happen. [Zack] Iphone 6 bendgate from an airbag. Okay. [Brian] Sweet. [Zack] Threetwoone! And it hit. [Classical music playing] {Zack] Wow, that was in the air for a while. [Brian] Its secure - that makes a difference. Its the whole force equals mass times acceleration. F = MA. [Zack] Tight. Well look this airbags a different color. Thats kind of fun. So it looks like even though we attached wires to the airbag it still exploded and separated itself from the sandbag. So we lost a little bit of the power but we had what like, 3 and a half seconds of hang time on that one? [Brian] Yeah, it was a significant difference. [Zack] So thats incredible. Like think about that much power hitting you in the face during a wreck but like [Brian] secured to like a 4,000 pound car. [Zack] Yeah. I guess its better than your face hitting the dashboard, but you know, its not a marshmallow either though. Airbags have to hurt. [Brian] Theres a lot of force there. There is venting so that when your face hits it, it actually cushes it and then the travel after impact makes a big difference. Thats why they do the lifesaving job that they do. [Zack] Where we started from way over thereit landed right here. Looks like there are a few more cracks on the screen. And we had a little impact crater here even. Looks like, yeah, the ribbon just ripped right off of that. You can see where it hit the corner here. Wonder if it still works. We got some green lines on the screen. It looks like the LCD is cracked this time aroundwhich, you know, its a little bit to be expected. Either way, a new replacement screen and this phone will be as good as new. [Brian] Thats not too bad when you consider that it was impacted to get it up into the air pretty hard. Thats where the bending came from and then hitting the ground too. Thats respectable. [Zack] Yeah the inertia lifting off of the airbag. So big thanks to Brian, without him my YouTube channel wouldnt exist. When I messaged him about my jeep breaking down 4 years ago and asked him why in the world he makes YouTube videos, he said it was to decrease world suck, and because you can make a little bit of money on YouTube. So I started doing the same thing with cell phones and thats how my channel came to be. We have a turkey and what are we doing with this turkey? [Brian] This isnt just any turkey; this is a butter ball turkey thats the same size and weight as a human head. [Zack] Oh boy. [Brian] Airbags come in contact with peoples heads all the time and thats what theyre supposed to dobut what if your head was right against the airbag when it went off? What kind of forces are we dealing with? So weve got a 1996 Mazda Millennia side impact airbag that were going to launch this turkey with. [Zack] So if you want to see what happens to this turkey using and even bigger airbag than what we were using on this cell phone, click this video right here and show Brian some love on his channel. Thanks for watching. Ill see you around.",

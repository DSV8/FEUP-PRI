    "transcript": "[Music] Mr Robot has to bump into an employee and he's going through the line and he he basically has this device in a bag on his chest and when he bumps into the employee he grabs the information from the card and then they go back home they store the data from the card uh and then go home and they take that information and clone the card and then use that card to get in the first step okay in being able to clone these cards is first of all place the card on top of the Proxmark and when it's on top of there you should see some lights go on and then we'll go LF this is low frequency search let's see if we can read it. I really want to thank Brilliant for sponsoring this video and supporting my channel here's an example of why I really like their training they have this course designing programs hon your coding skills by writing complex programs to build games and apps we start with programming a game and then they go through options such as decomposition event driven programming functions debugging arguments and scope internal variables etc but notice how interactive this training is so I'm going to start this lesson on programming a game and in this lesson we're going to program a very famous game so I'll click continue and we asked to add a statement run and check our code so let's start the problem notice they've taken us into a gaming environment and we need to code the program by adding statements so this block needs to obviously move left by one but then we need to move it down by let's say five so we put that value in and then we click run and hopefully we solve the game and as you can see we have now we need to rearrange and delete statements so this is really basic programming that you need to learn so as an example how do we rearrange or delete statements to complete this task and make sure that that block fits nicely so first thing I would do is rotate 90 and then we need to move it down by six so we could delete these two statements and hopefully if we run the program I've done this successfully and as you can see I have now what about this one now we need to look at rotation so we need to rotate this and I would say 270 then we need to move it down I'm not quite sure here let's say six maybe that works click run program and I think I got that right how did you do by going through this okay here's a more complicated one how would you do this here we need to add a loop and Nest some statements so I equal to 1 2 3 let's add that statement we're going to want to move this right and move this down I would say so let's run that and see if that works and check problem looks like we passed the test so as you can see very basic programming concepts are taught here this is going to get more and more complicated as you go through the course so you're going to have have to learn as an example how to display fireworks and play the game what I really love about this very interactive very Hands-On you're basically learning to code by guess what coding might be simple coding initially gets more complicated as you go on but that's how you learn to code start with something simple but what's nice about this is it's a game which makes it more fun it's very interactive very hands-on you're learning by doing not just by watching someone else do it.

Everyone it's David Bombal back with the amazing OTW OTW welcome. Thank you David it's always an honor to be back on your show the best it and cyber security Channel on YouTube. Always appreciate you saying that just for everyone who doesn't know OTW and you should by now he is the author of this book Linux basics for hackers very very popular book on Amazon he's also written other books one of my favorites Network basics for hackers and he's also got Getting started becoming a master hacker so check those books out I'll put links below if you're interested OTW I don't want to put you on the spot but hopefully at some point we're going to get a new Linux basics for hackers right? yeah we're it's in the process right now and the the preliminary schedule is I believe it's scheduled to come out like April or May of next year so yes and it'll 2025 right 2025 and it'll be all up to date with the new Kali and some of the changes that have been taking place in Kali um a as your viewers know we've been doing a series on Linux basics for hackers and I think we're up to like chapter six or something like that um and so that's all updated there that's all new stuff we also have the complete uh course in the on Hackers Arise that the viewers can can purchase there or if you're a student you get it for free. Yeah I'll put that link below for everyone who wants to watch uh the videos that we've done talking about the basics of Linux with the updated book but OTW one of our most popular videos has been Mr Robot and it's been a long time since we've done a Mr robot video and a lot of people have asked for it so I'm very happy to hear what you've gotten you know to share today I believe it's a Mr Robot hack thing and you're also going to talk about the technology right? Yes well I I love doing Mr Robot and I think we should do I think we should do more in the future you know I love doing them I think the viewers love watching them and as you know Mr robot's really like my favorite hacker show maybe my favorite show and and and so it's fun to go through the hacks that he does in that show and and try to dissect them and see what he's actually doing because a lot of people don't know that the hacks that he is doing are real hacks there's almost there's almost I can't think of any hack in the show that's not real the only thing that's not real is the time frame right so he'll get he'll do things very very quickly that might take hours or days all right so that's the only real difference between what he's doing there in reality unlike a lot of TV shows and movies that are totally unrealistic. I agree with you it's a great show for anyone who's interested in like real world hacking but I want to keep quiet now and hand it to you what are we going to be looking at specifically today? Okay well let's let's talk about the show a little bit so that uh the viewers who are new here uh can get some perspective on what's taking place so we're talking about episode 5 from season 1 all right so Elliot and the F Society crew have decided that they need to destroy the backup tapes okay from Evil Corp e Corp or evil Corp right and those tapes are all in storage at a company called steel mountain right that is up in apparently Upstate New York if I remember correctly and that's actually there is a a real company in the United States called Iron Mountain that does exactly the same thing Iron Mountain stores tapes and digital media and actually paper media as well that's what they do for companies and they put them in these fireproof imp penetrable facilities and the the steel Mountain facility actually has a sign in front of it in the show it is impenetrable right and so face mistake right right you never never say unhackable or impenetrable if you do that you're just asking for trouble right and so they have to find a way to get into this facility to put inside in this case they're going to put in a r Raspberry Pi into the facility to control the HVAC system so one of the beauties of Mr Robot is well one of things I love about it is that they do a lot of SCADA hacking like the prison hack and then this is a SCADA hack 2 where they're going to go into the HVAC the the heating and air conditioning system and be able to turn the temperature up on one of the holding facilities so that it will make the tapes unusable right so they go put a Raspberry Pi this episode involves a lot of social engineering and so I'm going to repeat what I've said so many times on your show and in my classes and that social engineering is really really important and anybody who ignores the importance of social engineering you you ignore it at your own peril because about 80% of all hacks have some social engineering aspect to it right so there's always a technical aspect but there sometimes most of the time there's a social engineering aspect and this episode five has a lot of social engineering and the first portion of the social engineering is that they have to somehow get inside the facility now the facility is well protected it it says it's impenetrable right and so they first of all in the previous episode they have hacked a car which we we've done here in in this on your show they've hacked a car and they're driving this minivan up to Upstate New York to get to the evil Corp storage facilities and they have to get in they know that there's all the entry points are protected by card keys right so to get in you have to present a card key a legitimate card key to get in past the gate and so what they do what they decide to do is that they find a coffee shop near the facility right and look for people who have their their card Keys their lanyards around their neck with a card key from steel mountain and once they've identified this and this isn't explicitly stated in the show but it's what it's actually happening they end up in a coffee shop and then it becomes a social engineering effort to be able to get close enough to to the card around the employees neck to copy the card right and this is this technology has been around for know 10 12 years so it actually came out just before the show was was uh presented and uh he first came out I think Bishop Fox was the company who first developed the the cloning technology and basically what it does is it just reads the data off the card right stores it in memory and then you can go ahead and clone the card and make the exactly the same card and so that's what their strategy is here and back when the show was made the technology required that you get very very close to the card almost almost touch it but in recent years several companies some security researchers have come out with technology that allows to your allows you to be able to clone or copy the card up to two or three feet it's basically putting more powerful antennas in so at the time the show was made he had to find a way to actually get right next to the C and that's where the social engineering aspect came in so Mr Robot not Elliott but his father played by Christian Slater has to uh bump into an employee and he's going through the line and he he basically has this device in a bag on his chest and he bumps into an employee and when he bumps into the employee he grabs the information from the card and then they go back home they store the data from the card into storage into the little device that he's holding in a bag uh and then go home and they may take that information and clone the card and then use that card to get in uh you using essentially his ID to get inside the facility and then they have much more social engineering for those you've seen the show to be able to get inside the facility and find the storage tape so that's kind of where the fun part becomes uh but the first step is they have to get inside the facility. So just for everyone who's watching we actually did a a video on like the tapes didn't we and we did the Raspberry Pi piece so I'll link those videos below so we covered that OTW which was great um so anyone who's interested in that can watch that as well but I got to ask you the question because I love it when people call me a boomer so that I'm not accused of being a boomer and old fashioned this was created before the days of Flipper Zero right so could they have done something similar today just using the Flipper Zero? Yes there's there's many different types of cards so in the show they're using a low frequency card that doesn't have much in the way of any type of encryption right but there there's dozens of types of cards and one of the things that is important to note is that some of the more modern cards have additional encryption and security measures and The Flipper zero can't do anything about those whereas the prox smart has the capability of one it has like 1,900 default passwords okay that you can you can try first to break into these cards and then it also has a Brute Force uh password cracking so these cards the more secure ones you can't just make a clone of them you have to be able to have a password that's encrypted on the card to be able to make a clone of it or to change any of the information the proart has that capability in addition we just had what last week we had a a new paper came out that uh some researchers in France were able to find a back door to the Mifare classic which is the most widely used of these encrypted cards so that you don't even require the password so here what we want to do is we just want to replicate what they did in Mr Robot which is is a pretty simple relatively simple hack um that you can simply capture the information from a card like they did on the show and then go ahead and clone it and we're going to be using the Proxmark smart which has been around for a while and it's probably the uh the leading tool for doing RFID Card hacking. So OTW you've just teased us about this article you got to tell us more uh what what actually happened? Well what happened is some I'm going to pull it up on the screen here for you is that some researchers in France had come and found some back doors into the most common cards there's millions of these cards out there and the Mifare cards are a technology that has been developed by NXP Technologies you'll Phillips okay and they that's the leading technology in these RFID cards and so these researchers here okay say significant back door and contact contactless cards made by China based Shanghai fudan microelectronics allows instantaneous cloning of RFD RFID cards used to open Office doors and hotel rooms around the world so this is um FM11RF08 cards okay and they've got a a back door in them that they would that these researchers discovered so these cards which are used in a lot of secure facilities are now going to be vulnerable to cloning so this is one of the things that uh is happening this is just last week so this is brand new um and of course this was what happened in Mr Robot happened 10 years ago almost 10 years ago now so they did some of the old attacks against these systems which is a low frequency card okay that's often used for these Gates and uh and they're relatively easy to clone you don't have to crack any passwords you don't have to find the back doors in them you can simply copy them and uh and then make a clone of them we're using the Proxmark let's go ahead and take a look at what the Proxmark looks like and I'll pull it up on the screen here Proxmark is um is I guess uh I think I paid about $80 for mine I give you some idea what they cost okay one of the things that I do want to mention for those people who are interested in using the Proxmark there it is right there is make sure that you get the upgraded Proxmark that has 512k in it because 512 megs I'm sorry uh because the the the firmware the new firmware the Iceman for firmware is going to take up about 350 megs so as a result if you get the older ones that only have 200 uh 256 you're not going to be able to use the new firmware that's the Proxmark I've got one sitting here on my desk I got it all set up setting it up is a is a little bit of a challenge it's got a lot of dependencies but once you get it all set up it works great okay so you can see here I've gone ahead and uh and got it all set up into a directory called Proxmark and then the command is simply pm3 one of the beauties of the Iceman firmware right is that he's got a lot of great help screens on it and it's got these nested help screens and so you can go to help screen just about any place to be able to find out what you need to do so here's the uh the help screen on it the first step okay in being able to clone these cards is first of all place the card on top of the Proxmark of course right it has to be close enough to read and when it's on top of there you should see some lights go on all right and then we'll go LF this is low frequency search and's see if we can read it there it is okay so what we've got is the basic information about this card and you know there's a lot of things that we can do with it uh once we have that information we could also do this high frequency search as well and do try that okay high frequency search and it's going ahead and searching the lights are flashing and say basically it doesn't have any of the high frequency it this is not a high frequency card this is a low frequency card right this is the kind that you they show in the show also it detected okay that it's EM410x okay it also tells us that this is the type of chip set that's being used the t55xx which is one of the older and least secure of the um technologies using these cards so once we've got that we can go and then do lf okay and then hid read all right and then we can go ahead and let's go and take the tag off this one all right there it is the unique tag ID right there let's copy it and I'm going to take another card all right and a blank card because that was one that's been used right let me see if I have another length card of low frequency card here I'm sure I do somewhere ah here we go okay here's another low frequency card and what we want to do now is to go ahead and use that tag ID all right so go lf hid right and then this tag ID paste it there no it's not going to let me paste from the clipboard there it is and then hit enter and it's coming back with an error message here let's see what it's saying all right oh I forgot the keyword clone that'll do it okay let's go LF okay hid clone and then all right got to tell it to clone it and then paste in the clipboard and there it goes looks like says preparing a clone hit try oh hid reader to verify okay it did went ahead and cloned okay now it says go ahead and try hid reader to verify all right did its job all right now let's go and do an lf hid reader to verify all right we did it good job so now what we're we have is a card that's identical to the one that they had uh identified in the coffee shop all right and then they went ahead and stored that information and then created a clone of it now this card is going to be exactly the same as the one that the employee had which is going to enable them to get in through the gate now it's important to note that not all of these cards are this simple to clone the one in the show is all right but with the man it's always it's always the easy ones easy to clone yeah sorry go there's some that are very easy to clone and the one that is the ones that are typically used in these gates are these low frequency cards that don't have a lot of security built into them and these are these are the variety okay of cards that are out this is only a these are just the Mifare cards that are out there and you can see there's all different types and the ones that the researchers um came found the back door and are these in this area right here but you can see that if you look at the security in here right some of the security is relatively low but as you get into the more more advanced one you're talking about they end up with DES and triple DES I'm trying to see where it points that out DES and triple DES and actually AES on some of the more advanced ones this one so DES and triple DES so you see these here and then a AES 128 and these so these cards have a small chip inside of them and an antenna and then they can go ahead and make it put credentials in that will enable uh some security into these cards and one of the things the prox smart does is that it actually will allow you to one try to crack the credentials by using you know the the default and was surprisingly a lot of these cards have default credentials and I'm like you know we find everywhere in the cyber security world people leave in the default credentials and if that's the case it only takes a few minutes to crack them if those they don't have the default credentials in then it can take some period of time sometimes hours to go do a Brute Force attack okay but it's only I think the the passwords are just two bytes so it doesn't take that long to go ahead and take try all the possibilities and they're they're a numeric by the way right they they are a numeric two byte passwords so it doesn't take that long to go through all the possibilities and do a Brute Force attack and of course if you know what the the back door is then you don't need the password at all to be able to clone these cards in some um institutions these are used with like for instance some cities use them for bus tokens like to to ride the bus and they have a a of money stored on them once you're able to break the encryption then you can not only clone the card but you can change the amount that is actually on there some schools and universities use it for students using cafeterias what have you so once you're able to break the encryption on these cards there's a lot of possibilities here and this is really one of the UN least understood areas of IoT hacking and that's one of the reasons why we've put together an IoT hacking class in October we'll be doing more on RFID NFC Bluetooth BLE and a number of other technologies that are used in IoT devices. I'm glad you're doing that because um it was funny I just saw at DEFCON some of the hotels were having forced inspection of rooms confiscating tools did you did you hear about that so you tell us the story you're good storyteller so tell us. Well I I wasn't there okay and uh but I believe you but you we assume you there if I'm there you don't know I'm there exactly um that's that's the important part um so what happened is that the the hotels felt really uncomfortable about having all these hackers around and they were doing inspections within the hotel rooms looking for wifi hacking and other hacking tools which I think is going to put off a lot of the security researchers the hackers I doubt that defc con's going to come back to those hotels again next year I mean they basically instituted a forced inspection of rooms which really put a lot of people off and people felt very uncomfortable about that but you can also understand their perspective that if you've got a hotel full of hackers right you got you got a hotel and and you know you you don't know anything is safe and also remember that the hotels in Las Vegas got hit with ransomware last year remember that yep right so they're par they cost them tens of millions of dollars in ransomware uh ransoms so they're particularly worried about that type of uh a type of attack but you know I don't know that um you going ahead and inspecting rooms without permission is the is the best way to handle that so yeah there's a l lot of attacks that require in a world where we have IoT devices that are growing at exponential rates I mean inside of people's homes there's all kinds of devices now that are connected by some Wireless technology whether it be RFID NFC nearfield communication Bluetooth what have you a lot of these these technologies have relatively weak security and one of the things that I most worry about is that these devices get hacked and then become part of a botnets and then those botnets get directed against a company a country right I mean that's how powerful these botnets can be and then this can be a form of ransomware so if I have a million IoT devices all um sending packets to your particular webs server what has happened in the past is that they demand a ransom to um stop the DDos attack and I've actually at hackers arise we had a similar attack a few years ago where attackers came to us and said if you pay us off now we won't attack your website and uh and I I laughed at them and and they attacked and they they took down our webs site for about 20 minutes or a half hour and we were able to block them um they were not real sophisticated attackers we were able to block them pretty easily and we paid them nothing at all but if they had millions of devices okay and if they had done a relatively sophisticated DDoS attack so one of the things that's important to note about a lot of these devices is that these devices have have a Linux kernel in them a very tiny Linux kernel and so if I gain control of your device I've got this little Linux kernel that I can use to send packets to any place in the world and so we saw for instance the Miral botnet a few years ago what was that 2018 somewhere around there the Miral botnet where we had millions of IoT devices that had all had default passwords in them which many of them do all being directed in against the number of different companies and uh this became a a huge problem and I suspect that we're going to see this again very soon I've been warning our students and our our clients that this is something to be prepared for that's one of the reasons why I've been doing more and more on DDoS because I think this is something that's going to be more important in the future if it isn't right now I mean we've seen a number of DDoS attacks that have been very effective especially in cyber warfare where a country will DDoS another country at as they invade right so cut off Communications so if you can DDoS the country then you cut off Communications between say the military branches and the government this has happened multiple times these IoT devices can be a way to generate incredible DDoS attacks larger than we've ever seen before and if if nothing else you these devices often times like the RFID devices that we're talking about here are ways that we secure a lot of different facilities these are used for for cards to get into secure locations to get into schools to get into businesses in the case of Mr Robot they were used to get into steel mountain and the older ones like those that are used in Mr Robot are really really s simple to be able to to clone as you get into the more modern ones that have some cryptographic uh security those can also be broken as this article in security week shows is that some of them that the most widely used technology which is the mifare classic has back doors built into it that make it easy to be able to change basically what you're doing is that once you've got the password then you can change the data on the card for instance you know the identity the facility the dollar amount all those things can be changed once you have the credentials so if you have a back door on these cards it would allow the attacker to clone the card and put any data they want into the card. Should I buy a Flipper Zero or should I buy a Proxmark? You know one of the things I lo question yeah that's a lot question I I have both okay yeah and and the beauty of the Proxmark if you're looking at RFID then the Proxmark has a lot of capabilities that the Flipper Zero doesn't The Flipper zero is kind of a g first of all I want to thank the the developers of flipper zero for raising awareness of all of the radio hacks all the radio signals that can be hacked out there because this is something that I've been talking about and promoting for a long time saying hey you know this is an area of cyber security that's really underappreciated so once the flipper zero came out everybody oh my God look at all the things that can be done so I'm thankful to the Flipper zero for that I think it's a limited device I hate I hate to say that you need to buy a Proxmark but if you're going to do RFID hacking I think the Proxmark is really the only way to go I'm not saying don't buy a Flipper Zero I'm saying if you want to do RFID I think the Proxmark3 is the device of choice. I think it's great about the Flipper Zero you've said it before the past as well right it's raised awareness and it's got a whole new generation interested in cyber security and um Flipper Zero is limited but it it shows you the possibilities right and shows you what what's out there. The other thing I want to point out here to a lot of um your viewers is I get people writing me and saying well well you know I want to start in cyber security but I can't afford to buy all the devices yep right y like no you don't need all those devices start simple start with your laptop, start with Kali or one of those other one of the other cyber security Linux distributions and start from there you don't need to buy all the devices I had several people said oh I you know I've got a laptop but now I can't afford to buy all the devices I need to become a cyber security hacker right I need all the gadgets y you don't need all the gadgets right start small start simple and then you'll figure out what gadgets you do need because there's a lot of gadgets out there right now and many of them are duplicative they do the same thing so don't don't feel like you need to buy all the gadgets before you get started in an earlier um video we talked about what you need to get started in terms of laptop and what I said then is that don't worry about getting the latest and greatest laptop right because in hacking 80% of hacking is the human being sitting behind the screen only about 20% is the actual computer in computer speed is not that important in hacking it's the skill level and some more important is skill level but also some tools and none of those tools really are dependent upon speed so if you can only afford a 10-year-old a cheap laptop go get it don't wait till you can go out and buy you know the latest and greatest and some people think that hacking is kind of like gaming that you need to have the super computer to be able to hack no that's not the case a gaming computer is very different than a hacking computer right you don't need like a a super graphics card to be able to do hacking now a super graphics card can be useful for password cracking okay and and other uh applications but you don't need it there's other ways to cracking passwords without a GPU so what I want to reiterate here is that you make sure you get started don't worry about the machine just make sure you have a machine and then start studying right start learning David's David's channel is a great place to start your learning. Occupy the Web I always get this about books right have you read this book book and do you recommend this? I really like that book uh we're going to be using segments of that book in our IoT hacking class it's written by some experts in the field and it's also it's a it's a no starch book no starch books are always excellent so you know I would highly recommend that book. Occupy the Web I went through this book I also thought it was great I did find that it went into the weeds about a lot of stuff is there section specifically on what we've been discussing and do you know do you do you like it? yeah I I love the book and there's a whole section called radio hacking and on that radio hacking they have RFID which I think is excellent and they also have the whole section on Bluetooth okay and Bluetooth low energy which we'll also be doing in our upcoming IoT hacking class they also have uh hacking WiFi and they also do a lot on the the threat landscape right the IoT landscape they talk about that they kind of introduce it and so you get some idea of how you know what types of things that you should be concerned about in this and why you should be concerned about it and so and then they also go into smart home hacking at the end of that book as well so I think it's I think it's a I highly recommend the book I think people should take a look at it uh make an investment in it you can almost always guarantee that a no starch press book is good going to be excellent I mean I obviously I'm I'm a little biased here Linux Basics Linux basics for hackers comes from from no starch and I know the people at no starch well I think they you but before I published with no starch I had a lot of no starch books on my shelf right because they are excellent. yeah I say I mean I need to just clarify something so I just wanted to show that I hopefully the viewers can see that they're they showing the Proxmark and they're showing a bunch of thing about the cards so maybe we can put up some b-roll about it so like a lot of the stuff we've discussed that really go into I really enjoyed that um but I will have to just for transparency no starch sent me this book so they've sent me some books but I'm like you I've had a I've bought a lot of books myself and um since I've been interviewing authors from no starch they've been sending me books so I'm not paid anything by no starch to review their books I simply get their books for free so just for transparency uh note that um so Occupy the Web I've bought your books um and I've also bought a whole bunch of other books but I'd agree with you a lot of the no starch books are excellent and the authors are great right they're people in the industry which is what's so important it's not people who are just talking about the industry there's people that are actually experts in the industry yeah you you can't go wrong with a no star there's been some I you know over the years there's been some books that have been not the best but in general the best the best books in the industry are coming out of no starch. I I love about cyber security it's so wide and it's that's why I love interviewing different guests like you you focusing now more on um IoT stuff and um it's it's so wide every time interview someone else it it's a whole world and I think that's encouragement for anyone who started right just get started and you know see which area you like because there's so many cool areas to get into. Right and you're not generally people are not going to become generous they're going to find an area that interest them they're good at and they're going to focus on that so you don't need all the gadgets that are out there you know I mean I remember I've had people oh I need a I need a Raspberry Pi, I need a pineapple, I need I need that I need a Flipper Zero, I need I need a hack RF one, I need no you don't need all those things get yourself a laptop start from there if you want to get into radio hacking or IoT hacking you might have to buy some additional devices but that's still down the line that's a little more advanced stuff get first of all get yourself familiar with Linux right and all the tools that are built into say a Kali and how to use them understand Linux understand Windows understand networking those are all the the basics you need to get started and then if you need then you might go out and buy one or two gadgets here or there but don't feel like to get started I mean literally in the last month or so I've had several people say I can't afford to buy all the gadgets y you don't need all the gadgets get started. I love it soOccupy the Web that's a great way to end off so really appreciate you sharing I love that just get started right just do it. Always good to be on your show",

    "transcript": "well hello Eber have you seen these speakers they're amazing thank you it all started with an April Fool's joke but now apparently there's going to be an actual product from Phanteks expanding him to audio apparently this thing is actually pretty cute actually so it's sound good for the for the size the whole RGB illumination and it's kind of like marketing for for the kid for the of all cases speaking over the evolv cases you guys know the evolv X and I've done a dual system configuration in it and it's kind of cool how they're showing its case in action so all dual systems we have one gaming PC at the bottom one streaming PC at the top and you can see the dual monitor setup that showcased that exact scenario by the way Eber you're not very good at this game you know I know I'm terrible I'm just kind of oh you're you're in the training yeah because because it's not online I'm just gonna peace out and again huge thanks to Phanteks and SteelSeries for making our computex possible and they also would like to go over some other changes regarding to Phanteks products including the eclipse line new power supplies new shift enclosure and some metallic gear stuff so let's begin with the Eclipse p360X so it's a $69 case and they've improved airflow and integrated LED elements into the front panel which was inspired by the automotive industry because of the three-dimensional look of how this LED strip looks from each angle so it might look slightly more ambient and soft when the front or more harsh because you can actually see the LED strip from the 45-degree angle or at a 90 degree angle it again looks like different so I get what they're trying to do but not a fan of the esthetic from the three sides I prefer something a bit more soft and ambient like what they've done with previous cases but at least they've improved on the airflow because on the original p350X which is still around by the way I'm guessing it was slightly bit more challenging as with the Eclipse p400a a stands for air flow where the done here is replaced a solid panel with a one that has more air flow so that whole front panel is full metal body which is awesome it also the dust filter and based on their own testing airflow has significantly improved and the P400 series we are told has been really popular for Phanteks and them adding an airflow version into the mix is awesome plus they're doing digital RGB fans version which is $89 and will include three fans on the front which are digital RGB with awesome effects while the $69 case will have two fans which are not RGB and two color options two glossy white or matte black and both a 360X and the P400a will be out-of-the-box compatible with the vertical GPU bracket that Phanteks also sells for $39 with a riser cable by the way so it's not just the bracket itself so you can go with a nice vertical orientation that is spaced out pretty far away from the side panel to have sufficient airflow and moving on to the evolve shift the vertical case which I absolutely love the aesthetics of now they're finally adding the airflow side panels and the cool thing about this story is that they found a speaker Factory and they're using them to manufacture the side panels with this high airflow fabric and therefore they're trying to target the whole HTPC market whereas the case now looks pretty modern not with glass but with fabric that is both slightly transparent so you can actually see the components and anything that's lit up behind it and it's acting as a dust filter that you can easily vacuum it's not going to rip and three the whole thing is about airflow so it will allow that whole vertical and horizontal airflow channel for both the CPU and the GPU and Max are excited to check out where the temperatures will be like with glass panel when it's completely closed when everything is just a little album inside versus when the high airflow mesh our panels are installed and since this is exactly the same chassis the panels will be backwards compatible with the original evolv shift and of course you can create this hybrid solution with the mesh on one side ntg on the other and that's for power supplies they have a new series called amp again they've partnered with C Sonic like they have with revolt X units and this one is a slightly lower more mainstream targets so 80-plus certification and 550 650 and 750 watt power supplies ranging from $89 to $99 two hundred and nine dollars as for the size they are pretty compact at 140 by 150 millimeters they are fully modular with black and flat cables we have a hybrid mode that stops the fans from spinning if your power supply is under 30 percent load they're using cable free interior for efficiency purposes and the main thing to take away from the amp series is there a hundred percent certified to work with the revolt ex power supplies which means that you can connect the amp power a power supply to the revolt X power supply route that power directly into that to expand your power capacity for more enthusiast systems so that means they are rated for reliability stability and connectivity to work within the whole ecosystem of what the revolt X power supplies try to do between either splitting power or adding more power supplies to create this massive pool of power so to say and that's pretty awesome for enthusiast guys and the last thing for Phanteks I promise you would be the metallic gear updates so this is a their separate brand that there's more lower tier and these cases range from $49 to $89 and Neil v2 line up which has been more refined and almost finalized and I'm excited to see what they can do with such budget enclosures so stay tuned for our sort of experience with metallic gear as a brand hopefully we'll get to see one of the Neo V twos in the studio soon all right guys I'm Dmitri thanks much for watching and stick around with this make sure to check out this other relevant content subscribe for more and yeah I'll talk to you in next video 12m perfect have time to edit",

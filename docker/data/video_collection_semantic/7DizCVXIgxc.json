    "transcript": "- Hey everyone, it's Justine, and today I partner with Best Buy to show you some unexpected tech finds. (upbeat music) Even though I'm one of the biggest Best Buy fan, it is always so surprising to find things on their website that I never thought Best Buy would carry. All of the things that I'm showing you today were things that I've had on my purchase list so I was so surprised and excited to find them at Best Buy. (upbeat music) First up, let's talk about health and wellness. Now, I was so excited to find this TRX trainer at Best Buy because this is something that I've always loved at gyms. So I was beyond hype to see they carry not only the TRX Elite System suspension, but all of the accessories like this TRX XMount Plate and this Invizi Mount Plate. The install is super simple. You just have to install these plates either on the wall or the ceiling, and you're good to go. And now I'm here about to install it in my own garage at home. Can't wait to try this out. (upbeat music) Here it is. So we have this little mesh bag, which is great because you can actually take this with you anywhere. I even saw online people have like tied these to trees, to the doors of hotel rooms. So you can basically have a portable gym wherever you have this. This looks like it's the door anchor. Oh, a little bracelet. Here's our suspension anchor, and we have some resistance bands. I love resistance workouts and I'm a huge fan of resistance bands. Even if you can't take the TRX system with you, these things are incredible. We've got a little workout exercise poster. Oh, we're definitely hanging this up. I've watched a bunch of review videos and I've seen a lot of people make this mistake. Never clip these anchors onto each other. You never want the metal to be touching the metal. This is the moment that I've been waiting for. I've been preparing for this honestly for days. I've watched so many YouTube videos. I was gonna hire a professional, but honestly, it's literally two holes that I have to drill and screw in. Gonna mark our holes. Now sign the drill. (drill vibrates) (upbeat music) Hole number two. (upbeat music) Great, so that looks pretty solid. Now that everything's unboxed, our mount is officially mounted, let's hang it up. (upbeat music) Okay, our posters all set up. Our TRX is hung, and now it's time to test it out. (upbeat music) Nothing yet, stay tuned. Another product that I love, is the Bosu Sports Balance Trainer. This is also a very simple gym accessory that I've never owned, but always loved using at the gym. Much like the TRX, this is another great tool for doing body weight exercises, advanced ab training and mostly used for improving your balance. I clearly have not been working on my balance recently, so I am so glad that I now have this added to my gym. It's all set up. This is so exciting. Oh yeah, I mean, I feel so fit already. There's also a bunch of workouts that you can do. So I've got this little QR code that I can scan and this will give you some manuals, workouts and wall charts. And I can add those to my TRX wall charts over there. (upbeat music) Now that we have our fitness out of the way, let's talk about travel. So recently I went to Europe and as a tech reviewer, I forgot one of the most important things that anybody really traveling outta the country would need and that is a travel converter or an adapter. This is the Insignia converter and adapter. So it'll convert from 240 to 120. So you'll be able to use this in different countries. It's super easy to use too. You just go like that for wherever it is that you're traveling to. So over here on the side, you have the adapter and converter so you can switch to whichever mode you'd like. And there's also two lights on the front that'll let you know which mode you're in. There is even two USB-A pots on the bottom. I also was traveling with an electric toothbrush that was really large. So when I saw this Quip plastic smart electric toothbrush, I couldn't wait to try it out. It's small compact and will actually earn you awards like free brush heads, products and gift cards as you track your brushing habits with their free app. There is nothing that I love more than earning awards for doing everyday tasks. So I also like that this has a little toothbrush cover so I can put my toothbrush in there and it has this adhesive on the back. So I can just basically stick that to wherever I want and my toothbrush is ready to go for my next brush. No travel is complete without a Mophie Powerstation. This is the XXL 20,000 milliamp hour portable charger. I really like this one because it has two USB-A and one USB-C, giving you the flexibility to charge multiple things with various outputs. It's also a pretty small size considering how much power it will be able to deliver. (upbeat music) This summer, I've been riding my bike a lot more and I haven't had a good bike lot. So I picked up this Kryptonite Evolution 1090 Integrated Chain. This thing is super tough and it makes me feel so much better leaving my bike somewhere out of sight when I go to a coffee shop or the beach. It's 100 millimeter size chain links made from steel. It has three stainless steel keys and one actually has an LED light with replaceable batteries. Time to go for a bike ride. I'm so excited about this bike lock because with an electric bike, you need to really have something that's pretty substantial. So hopefully this is rated eight out of 10 as far as security rating. So let's take you out for a spin. (upbeat music) So you may have seen this in my previous videos. I've talked about the the Theragun. I use it after workouts. I've been using it for the past couple of years and I absolutely love it. But this is the TheraFace Pro. So if you've never heard of Theragun it's basically just like a massage gun that's able to get into like trigger points and get into deep tissue. Well now they have a face aversion. It comes with a bunch of different accessories, I haven't unboxed it yet. So let's see what's inside. (upbeat music) Comes in a nice little traveling case too. So inside we have the Therabody which looks very similar in kind of the style and shape to some of their other devices. This is bringing that same concept of relaxing the muscles but for your face. It'll give you a firming or microcurrent facial massage, LED red and blue light therapy, deep cleaning. It has an OLED screen and 120 minutes of battery life. So we can change the different color LED lights. I mean, I feel youthful already. Just one simple pass. (machine vibrating) Here we go. (machine vibrating) (woman mourns) Definitely I feel relaxed. Interesting, that's cool. So you can change the intensity. I'm excited to try this out more but here's all of the accessories that we have. You can just swap these pretty easily, just like so. You guys aren't even gonna recognize them me anymore after my TheraFace Pro treatments. (upbeat music) I recently got a new studio and have been wanting to upgrade the thermostat to the Google Nest Learning Smart wifi thermostat. I had them in my home for a while and have always loved the integration with Google and the way that the Nest is able to learn my habits to conserve energy. Also, because it's connected to an app, it's super easy to control from anywhere, even if I'm not at the studio at the time. Lastly, we have this Hover-1 Jive Electric Folding Scooter. It'll get me 16 mile max operating range and up to 14 miles per hour max speed. This summer I found myself going to the pool and meeting friends around town. A lot of times trying to find parking around the beach or pool is impossible. So even if I had to drive somewhere, I could just fold this up, put it in my car, park far away and if I need to, I can cruise to my destination. Okay first of all, let's check out a few of my favorite highlights. It's gotta bell. (bell rings) Gotta love it. This does have three different modes and it also has a light. Now, not only does it have a light up here up front but check this out. We've got some LEDs here on the board as well. We've got a kickstand which is clearly always something that's important. Got some brake lights back there. So this is our throttle. So basically to get started, you get going, hit the throttle and also has this nice speed lock function too. So if you are going on longer rides, you don't have to continually hold the throttle. This is your breaks. Also has a really nice folding mechanism. So we just pull up right here, pull out, fold and you're ready to take this wherever you need to go. I never thought that I was a scooter person but here we are. Apparently I am one. (upbeat music) If you guys are interested in any of the things that I showed you today, I will put a link in the description to BestBuy.com. I had so much fun checking out all of this unexpected tech. Leave me a comment below and let me know what your most unexpected tech find is that you found in Best Buy.

    "transcript": "Sometimes these tech upgrades go very wrong. Did you just break my bed? I can't watch p*** anymore. Your fill stick cannot appear in the video. Six inches, I think. This is what you think six inches is. But today, that cannot happen because AMD has sponsored a $5,000 ultimate tech makeover for our one and only queen of HR, Ariana. Now, I heard that the theme today was bunnies. Yeah. Like we've got some bunny related things. I'm going to be on my best behavior and make sure that I adhere to whatever is most appropriate and good throughout the entirety of this video. Bunnies, right? Yeah. This is going to be a lot of fun. Oh, that makes way more sense. I mean, this is good too. Yeah. This is really cool. They really like oats. This is oats. Yeah. I don't think oats are that cool. No, you got to like tap on it. Oh, oh my goodness. You guys love oats. Okay, how do I feed it to them? Pinch a little bit and just, you can either put it in the palm of your hand or you can just put on the ground. They're so fuzzy. Who needs stuffed animals when you have real animals? And then when you're done with them, you can have them stuffed. No, absolutely not. I'm going to write you up for that. What about this is bunny themed exactly? Is this a nanny cam or? I thought there were bunny things. Yeah, this is a bunny desk mat. Okay, that's pretty cool. So it's not actual things for rabbits. It's just a rabbit themed things. No, I do have something for rabbits right here. Oh, this piece of furniture is new. Oh, that's super cool. It's a whole rabbit tat. Habitat for rabbits. It's a word I made up. Now, are they potty trained? Is this a toilet? That's their toilet, but they decided to put some. Oh, oh, there's already poop in it. Gifts there, yeah. Oh. Yeah. Perfect. Is this where it lives? No, so it's going to go into the bunny room. All right. That sounds like a great starting point. I guess we just grab an end then? Oh, that's heavy. I can't do it. Okay, Colin. One, two. What? Oh, my side has a whole handle. I can take this end. It's okay. I got this, I got this. Do you want to take off the plants first? What kind of hijinks would we have if we took everything off before we lifted things up? Wait, are you okay, Colin? You got it? Ooh. But the plants are going to go here. Why did you put them here? It's pretty. Is this part of the upgrade too? So yeah, this is going to be a greenhouse. Oh, it's white. Thank you, Linus. That's why there are shelves. Yeah. Oh no. They're special shelves for my plants. I gotta say, I think this is right up there with Live Laugh Liao for most superfluous items. It's kind of funny you say that because I have one more surprise for you. Holy shnikes, and they couldn't be arsed to take the little extra pieces that they laser cut out of them. So they're just everywhere now. If only there had been some way for us to prevent these from scattering everywhere. Oh no. It's my bunnies. It's bunnies. And I got the idea from Dennis. Oh my goodness. Because of a sign. Please tell me you didn't get the price tag from Dennis. This looks way more expensive than his. Yeah, it was $1,000. It was $1,000? US. It's custom. It's for my babies. Wow. They won't notice. They can't tell. They're rabbits. I will notice. I will notice. Oh my gosh. That's the power supply it shipped with? What the hell? Did it come with a cover for this? This is 120 volt AC. If you plug this into the wall and you go like this, you get zappy zappy. Are you on the safety committee? Yes, I am. There we go. Okay. That's the money shot, right? Okay, we don't call it that though. This is a good shot of a product. I hope that went over your head. Well, let's plug it in. I'm really confused though, because I have three switches. Oh. You gotta be kidding me. That's their control scheme? Is I have, they're all, what? Really? They were really nice. For $1,000? Before we hang this on the wall, should we throw AMD a bone and show off what you got that's AMD powered? This is an interesting choice and one that I'm seeing more and more people make. These handheld gaming PCs, this one running AMD's Ryzen Z1 Extreme have gotten so powerful that we saw people using them not only for portable gaming, but even as their primary machines that they would either dock with an external GPU or simply not bother to dock with an external GPU when they wanted to use it as a desktop. I see you've already been enjoying it. Yeah. What kind of games do you play? I have the Elder Scrolls, and then I got this one, Gris. Hopeful young girl lost in her own world, dealing with a painful experience in her life. It's kind of wild to think that a gaming PC with legitimate enough graphics horsepower that you can play AAA older games like Skyrim or even newer AAA games that now fits in the palm of your hand is incredible. And I'm really into this one. This is actually what I daily drive for, handheld PC as well. The best thing about the Ally is Ariana's not the only one getting one today. As part of the sponsorship deal, AMD is hosting a giveaway. All you gotta do is head over to our Twitter. We're gonna have it linked down below and you can try your luck. It really is an amazing mobile gaming device. Hey, quit playing games. We're trying to do an upgrade here. No. Sorry. Ow. Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. I only kicked it. I didn't step on it. Well, no, kick is better than step on. Nothing. Well, it's a light kick. No. Going in, he's going in. Oh, is it? Wow, is he using it already? Yay. Oh, wow. He needed to go to the bathroom. On the stairs. That's where I go to the bathroom. Yeah, on the stairs. It's the best place to go to the bathroom. It's so convenient. It's fine. I saw where the rabbit was. Yay. Okay. Awesome. He's in it again. Maybe this should be this way. That's kind of where I thought it was going. Yeah, right? Yeah. Yeah, I think it'll look good. Okay, all right. This is not an experience I've ever had before. It's your upgrade. And it's my birthday. And it actually is your birthday today. Daddy! Okay, how's that look? I think that looks way better. It looks crooked on your side. Oh. Like it needs to go in a tiny bit more. Yeah. I'm thinking front and center, right here. Yeah, well. Ta-da! That, I actually would kind of, that's kind of cool. But then it's too busy on the one side. There's nothing here. I can hold this all day. It's really light. Okay, thanks. Okay, stay there. I think it's a giant neon rabbit. Yeah. And tastefulness was in the rear view mirror a long time ago. Hey, right there? Yeah. Okay. Thanks, Andy. Wow, look at that. That's so cute. Very cute, actually. That's very nice. In all seriousness, I think these are very cute. How much did they cost? You know, we could have made these on our laser cutter, right? I didn't know that. They would have cost like, I don't know, $6 or something. Actually, big pieces of acrylic are pretty expensive. It might've cost like 20 bucks. Oh no, how much did we pay for them? It was like, how do you say times five? Like, I don't know what these are. I think that's your moss pole. Oh! They didn't give the moss part. They just gave the... I'm glad this was complimentary because it looks very cheap. He caught himself again. It's our paper skin and glass bones. Uh-oh. What's up? We did not nail this. Oh God, you're right. No! What the hell? Where'd that one go? So you do have extra holes in the wall. Oh, there's the dot. Oh! The dot's also not really in the right place. I'm not gonna fix that. Thanks, ma'am. That's to go in your hand, not the wall. There, I'll catch the hole. No! I can see why you didn't upgrade much about your desktop setup. All we did was add the webcam, the desk pad, and ooh, these are nice. Some bamboo Kanto speakers. I actually love this. I'm holding it upside down, but other than that, I'm doing a great job right now. Beautiful. It matches the other bamboo colored stuff. Yeah, kind of. Kind of. It's close enough. It's really good. Yeah. If you're happy, I'm happy. Yeah. Now, you have a couple of things here that are not plugged in. I couldn't help noticing. I don't have a big enough power bar. I count three. Did you by any chance think to grab a power bar for your upgrade? Oh, you did bring something. Success. Wow. It's a big one. Wow, a Ugreen DigiNest Cube. 65 watts. There's hay. There's hay in your outlet. There's hay everywhere. There's actual hay in the outlet. Yeah, if you're a bunny owner, you know hay is just everywhere. I thought you were really good at like cable management and stuff. Really? Yeah, isn't that what you're doing? Whatever gave you that impression? I'm ready to discover all of the intentional tangling that I've done. Oh my God, are you serious? That's a good one. Okay, well, anyway, here's power for your speakers. Oh, to the right. Sorry. Okay, there. Is it getting it? No, this way. Oh. Goodness. I almost never get to hang out with Ariana. This is great. I'm having a blast. So your options are to not be able to see your bunny or to not be able to hear your audio properly. I could just move my bunny like right here. Oh, I mean, that was also an option. Any particular rationale behind this Vizio soundbar? Someone asked in one of our chats for like a good soundbar and then Gary was recommending a bunch. He made like this giant list. So then I just went and looked and I was like, this is a good price point. And then I just picked that. That is how most people shop for things. That's why price points matter so much. And what's the point of a soundbar for your setup? Oh, I'm sorry. You were drinking on the job. It's water. Yeah, I have no way of knowing that. Could anything but alcohol be in a vessel like this? You can smell it then. I don't know what alcohol smells like. I've never had alcohol. That's a lie. How much of this video are we actually gonna be able to use? There'll certainly be a lot on the cutting room floor. LMG.GG slash floatplane. That's where our exclusives and behind the scenes go. Oh my gosh, another remote. Probably not necessary. But on the plus side, we just got two AAA batteries. Woo, I'm excited actually. Let's find out if that controller works. Hey, okay. Why does it have these extra two leads off it then? You can either just hook up the one and have a maximum brightness that is lower, but be able to control it with the remote, or you can hook up all three, have a higher maximum brightness, but the only granularity of your control is these switches. That is janktastic. I think that's bright enough though, realistically. I like it like both of them bright because one of them's dimmer. Oh, okay. Don't feel like you need to help or anything. It's okay, I got this. I don't know what to do. It's your upgrade. You can do whatever you want. I don't know what to do. Here, I'll do this. Power cord. Excellent. Your Christmas lights are here. I know. I found them. It's that bunny blocker. Oh, ow, dang it. Oh, I don't. It attacked me. It was coming right for me. Oh, my guitar. I mean, I can think of one way that we can tell if it's damaged. Why don't you play something? No, I'm learning. Okay, well, show us what you learned. No, I don't want to play. Oh, you ruined the wall. No, that was already there. That's fresh. Look at that, my wall. Here, hold on. I have a solution. What? Don't put it on the wall. Anyway, we do need to plug the HDMI cable into the soundbar though. So can I pass it through to you? Yeah. Yeah. Please. Oh, yeah, there it is. Oh, is it talking? It's talking. I don't like that. Do you want to turn the TV on? No, no, it doesn't have a power button. How much you want to bet? I looked at the manual, everything. There's no power button. Yeah, it has a power button. That's right here. What? No. Where? It uses the nipple control. But it says okay. It's not intuitive. You have to like push on the nipple, which normally wouldn't be how to operate that. So can I expect my write-up to be verbal or written? Or write email? Written. Okay. Written meeting. A written meeting. Oh, wow. Oh, please blurb. I love your gamer tag. It's amazing. Okay, Roblox. Apparently this is a game you play, so that's for adults. No, my sister comes over and plays Roblox and Fortnite. Yeah, I mean, that's what I would say. No, actually though. Yeah, that's what I would say. For some reason, Roblox has taken too long to start. Fortnite has never sounded better. Linus, can you do the floss? I did it successfully once. I can't fully wrap my brain around it. Yeah, there you go. Yeah, I think that's it. Yeah, but I can't go fast. Faster, faster, faster. Faster. I can't do it. I give up. That was pretty good. All right, let's see if the sub just immediately kicks in. Wow, that sounds good. That's so cool. I've always had my sound come through my TV. It makes such a difference, doesn't it? It does. Hey, thanks, Elijah. This is looking awesome. Guess what? It's up. Oh, it looks so good. Is it everything you ever dreamed of? Oh, it's so cute. You know what would really enhance this moment? A joke. No. What would they call you if you were like eight inches taller? Ariana Venti. You know that those are like exposed, right? Yeah. Yeah, it hurt. What, you did not. I didn't mean to. Elijah, what the heck, man? Are you okay? I'm fine. It was very quick, but I was like, oh, okay, that's up. Yeah, 120 volts is not fun. Yeah, it sucked. Yeah, so basically those are live and that's bad. It's a really good design. Thank you Now you want the greenhouse moved into the corner here, right? Yeah. But then it will not have any natural light. Yeah, that's why I got some grow light. Oh, we got grow light. So we actually move it away from the window so we can put the grow light in. Well, okay, even- What are you growing under that grow light? Plants. Yeah, I wouldn't know what pot looks like anyway. No. Now that we've switched over to plant stuff, I feel like the bunny bit was played out. All right, I'm ready to help with plants. Did you take that from the bunnies? Maybe. I hope it's clean. Does this look straight? Here's a way to tell. You just poke your finger there and then see if it's in the same spot. It's not straight. Yeah. It goes this way more. Oh really? I thought the other way. Wait, wait, wait. NFA 14 five volt. A USB power adapter. It comes with little crimp-on things. What? What are you even doing, Noctua, you absolute mad lads? We're gonna have to weatherstrip a bit. Oh wait, we're gonna like seal it up. Yeah. Wait, so do you want air flow or do you want it sealed? I don't know, I looked at the DIY online and it said get this and this and this and this. I'm trying to make that. Why would we weatherstrip it if we're trying to have circulate? I don't know. Or wait. Here, I'll look at my phone and I'll see what they said. I'm just gonna start building it while she's gone. She's smoking. Colin, you didn't by any chance get a metal hole saw, did you? I bought that. There's two layers. Oh, okay, so we'll just take one layer off and then. No? I mean, like it's this thick. Oh. And there's a bracket in the corner where I'm drilling. We, yeah, we need to hit the Home Depot for a metal hole saw. Yes, good, good. Okay, so what we wanna know is actually, oh yeah, it's well, it's equal, it's equidistant. So yes, it works. Okay, Ariana, show me where you want it. I mean, yeah, I'll try. That's good enough for you? Okay, cause it's never coming off now. It's VHB. Okay. Sure. That's where it goes. Perfect. This is a humidity sensor, I think. And it's broken. Oh, it was. Hey, look at that. It is not, it is. Freedom units, perfect. No, I don't like that. I know, don't worry, we'll try and change it by clicking. Oh, the one button, perfect. That was easy. Okay, and so that would go front and center. No. Yeah, it's so cute. Back and center. Middle and center. I mean, remember, it's gonna read it wherever it is. So you want it wherever it should be reading it from. Okay, let's go ahead and see if she powers on. You guys ready? Hey, that looks awesome. All it needs now is some plants and air flow. And RGB. Oh my God. Oh, alcohol prep pad. Yeah, we'll need that. And she says she doesn't drink. What? You need a special pad to drink alcohol? I didn't know that. These jokes are just getting worse and worse as the day goes on. You know what though? It's very diffuse. Oh, that looks so good. Okay, good, she likes it, then it's good. Here, I'll do these two points and then you do those two. Oh, it's not long enough. So that's fine. Okay, that's fine. Yeah, we'll just go up until it is like and such. Am I the first in the world to have an RGB greenhouse? Believe it or not, probably not. Probably not. Oh. Given like weed culture. I'll be the first in the world to have it done by Linus. Yes, that is true. Oh, my wall. What's up, what's up? Wait, what? What was that? Oh, it might be like one of the buttons. Like your buttons might've been, yeah, on your butt or this. I have magic eraser. Oh, hey, look, it worked. You should try it on the other one over there. That's paint. Yeah. Ah, well, good thing we're putting a hole there. I need that fan cable to come through this hole. Is it not? Nope. It has to go through two holes. And we totally went through the corner brace, but in like a really good way. Oh, nice. Perfect. Look at that fan spinning. Awesome. Distraction. Distract them with movement. Run away. So pretty. Okay, but what about this? You got your dock for the ROG Ally over here. Oh, my goodness. We've got this great little dock, so you can add USB, ethernet, and HDMI to your ROG Ally. Boop, a little something like that. Oh, it helps if you actually plug in the USB-C power pass through. What was that? Are you okay? Yeah, I kicked this downstairs, and so I was like, oh, I'm gonna go grab it. Totally ate it. So I was standing here, and that bang, bang, bang sound you might've heard. I did, yeah. Yeah, I was like, what was that? And I was like, oh, crap. So I walked down to go get it, and I got to like the third step, and just went, and I was gone. I was like, this is it. I warned you guys before. You did. I said, hold on to the remaining. I was holding on. It didn't save me. Oh, my gosh. What did I just pair? DeskJet 2700 series. That's my printer. Yeah, it sure is. Can confirm. Can I get you to verify something, please? That's the hole saw. What's the matter? Didn't your parents teach you about tools? No. What? No. They raised one. Oh, that's true, yeah. What? Don't say that. Hey, this looks awesome. I mean, you know what they say. If she doesn't find you handsome, she better find you handier, however it goes. Who says that? Lots of people. Dang it, Elijah. That's not it. What? That's not my fault. The cable's in the way. The cable. No, it's not. Guys, I really don't know if that's the problem. Oh, yeah, it might be. Are you happy with it being that much closed? Yeah, but the cable needs to go that way. I think it will help. Well, oh, wait. Is our hole saw here? Overall, though, you guys did a bang up job here. Good job. Nice weather stripping. Okay. Oh, no. Oh, wow. We definitely made a tactical mistake. Oh, man. This is really bad. I should not have widened that hole. Oh, yeah, there she goes. Woo! Ow, hot! Why? Don't touch! You know what? For that being by hand, huh? Pretty good. Almost 90 degrees. I need a little clearance here. Give her the old leany lean. Oh, my God, all the plants are gonna... No, no, they're fine. It's good for them. They like sideways gravity. Ah, there's hot metal filings everywhere. Oh, my gosh, it burns. They're like red hot and they fall on my hand. Ah! That frickin' hurts. Can we put gloves on? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I think my arms are covered in burns. So to finish some of the cables up, we're gonna use our upcoming magnet cable holders. These are actually the medium plates. We forgot to bring the small plates, but what these do is you can either use the 3M on the back to stick it to a surface, or they actually got little pass-through holes so you couldn't screw it into something. And then use these little bridges. Cables go in there. Boom, just like that. Ah, that's so sick and easy. I love it. Russian Fishing 4. Well, don't ask me. It's in your game library. No, it's not. Yes, it is. I can't look around. I can only move forward and back. Does it work on this one? Dang it, what the heck? Why? This is actually running shockingly smoothly. This has gotta be pre-rendered. Holy crap, I don't think this is pre-rendered. I thought he flipped the bird there. That face he made. Hey, all right, couch potatoes. Quit sitting around. Let's work off those pounds. Woo! Oh, I'm sorry. Did I just body shame you here? This'll make you feel better. Why do I? Oh my gosh. Why this? I got you a Peloton. And this'll make you feel better. It's a whole thing. Peloton launched a campaign where the husband gives the wife a Peloton and then body positivity activists were super mad about it. And then Ryan Reynolds hired the woman to do an ad for Aviation Gin when he owned it, okay. You guys who get it will get it. The point is let's have a look at the last and biggest piece of the upgrade here. This is really cool though. Come on, let's clock those pounds away. This is a small medium, by the way. I paid $50 for this costume. Wow. I was gonna ask how much you spent on costumes today. Too much. Okay. To be clear, it's okay to give someone a Peloton when they ask for it. I have to confess to you. I have never actually seen one of these things in action. Have you tried it out yet? I did. Yeah, so how does it work? I see it's got a camera so it can watch you sweat. Which is not a weird thing to do. Look it, you got the same outfit almost. Oh wow, yeah. Okay, well let's do that then. The 80s rock ride. Didn't these guys get in trouble for like not licensing the music that they were playing and stuff? All right, show us how it's done. Me? No, no, no, no. What, who else is gonna ride it? What, I'm not gonna, I don't need to ride it. You got the outfit, what do you mean? Geez, this is ridiculous. I have to keep that speed? Yeah. No, I can't do that. This is warm up. What, this is, how long do I have to do this for? Half an hour. I can't do that. Why not? But the whole, that's like 300 watts. That's it, that's all I got. I got no cardio. This is who Dennis lost to. Heads up. Head punch. Fantastic grapple. Linus! Oh, look at that, you can cycle down the road. Yeah. Hey, you don't have to travel anymore. Come on, you gotta do more. You gotta do 10 more. The resistance is on 58. Well, I don't know how to change that. Oh, well, you didn't tell me about the knob. That would have been easier. Yeah, your output watts is like 130. Hold on, I wanna see that at 300. Let's go. Here we go, here we go. 300 watts. It's like 93. Okay, fine, there. Okay, I'm just kidding. 300 watts, here it comes. I can't do that. No, she's got this, she's got this. 240, 240, 240, it's leg day. It's leg day. 324! Yeah! Hopefully you'll get a lot more use out of this than most people do out of their exercise cycles. Yeah. I've certainly gotten a lot of use out of this video. This has been a ton of fun. Thanks, AMD, for sponsoring this ultimate tech upgrade. Man, we got everything today. We had the rabbits, we had accessorizing the PC, we had the ROG Ally, which, by the way, reminder, giveaway, we've got the link down below. We had the whole gardening aspect of it. We had exercise. And then now we bring it all full circle, right? You've got these rabbits, you've got all these plants that you can use to fatten them up. So, the last part of the theme today is, when's dinner? What? Get out. All right, see you later! I can't get out!",

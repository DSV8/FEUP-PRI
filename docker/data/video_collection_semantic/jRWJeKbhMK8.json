    "transcript": "hi Hey, how's it going guys? This is Dave2D So the 12-inch Macbook from 2015, really nice looking device But it was geared towards a specific type of user not everyone could make it fit into the lives Same thing goes for the 2016 model though. It's been updated, but a lot of it remains identical It's got the same aluminum body with Incredibly high build quality Probably the best in the business. It still has an awesome display with pretty much quad HD resolution, great viewing angles, good screen brightness, and pretty good color accuracy The 480p webcam that people love to hate on is still there I think it's weird that they didn't change this. the keyboard is also unchanged it uses the same shallow butterfly switches that took awhile for me to get used to, but I've grown to like it a lot the force touch trackpad is unchanged. It's one of the best track pads out there, and it still has fantastic speakers I think it's the best speakers in this class of laptop and most importantly and kind of surprisingly it still has one port for everything including Charging usb connections and outputs for displays if you're looking for an adapter This is by far the best one I've used good number of ports It doesn't overheat and it has USB C pass-through, so you can charge while you're using it There's a link below if you want it, so the refresh hasn't changed at all aesthetically except now comes in Rose gold So I was actually interested in Rose gold. I was going to get it I saw it in person and I checked it out. you might have bigger balls But I highly recommend checking that in person Before you commit to buying it because really it's a really large slab of pink to be carrying around The things that have changed first the processors are slightly faster They now run skylake chips and for the core M3 geekbench pegs it to be around 15% faster Most of that speed boost actually comes from the increased memory bandwidth and memory clock speed the drive speeds have also improved they were reasonably fast last year But this year's models definitely a step up the thing is unless you're opening massive applications or importing a ton of photos This speed increased isn't that pronounced I mean, it looks big But regular computer usage like emailing and web browsing and just media consumption all of those things feel pretty similar on the new drive Maybe like five to 10% faster at best the other spec bump is the integrated graphics So these skylight chips have the HD515 graphics chips for gaming you're still only able to play lightweight titles But they run quite a bit smoother than last year's Macbook that use the HD5300 So would counter-strike go you can hit like 45-50 frames per second this is with everything turned down to lowest settings and for MOBAs like dota or heroes of the storm you'll hit like 40 maybe 45 frames per second when you're laning so it's still not a gaming machine like far from it But if you have one, and you want to play something light, it's not bad the HD 515 it doesn't accelerate much else though So it's not noticeable in Adobe Premiere or even in adobe lightroom unless you're using like the develop module So even though the new graphics chip is nice, it's not really noticeable for most applications The Graphic strip from last year's Macbook could only push an external 4K display at 30 Hertz The HD 505 can theoretically push it out at 60 Hertz but the USB 3.1 port is still first-generation there is no Thunderbolt 3 so there's not enough bandwidth for 60 Hertz And there's not enough bandwidth for an external GPU connection if that's what you're looking for in terms of their thermals, they're basically identical now keep in mind that this is the core M3. Which is like the base model I can't speak about the core M5, or the core M7 But in terms of the base model, they are essentially identical to last year the physical battery size is the same But it packs a little bit more juice and when you combine that, with the improved efficiency of the sky like chips you'll get like 10% more battery life the price hasn't changed and I'm a little bit surprised But if you look around in the refurbished section of the apple store, you can get the 2015 models for like 15% off That's not bad Okay, the 2016 Macbook a lot of stuff hasn't changed so like the price, the single port, the webcam, if those were deal-breakers before they probably still are the performance has improved a little bit and the graphics chip is nice for some users But unless you're playing games or like you're really jonesing for a pink one I think a used or refurbished 2015 model is a better value That's the end of this video. Hope you guys liked it Give me some thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it. It's been nice. I'll see you guys next time",

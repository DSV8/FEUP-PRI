    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and I'm here with Ro. - Hello. - Today I thought we would do a Ro reacts, video. - Oh, wow. Oh, wow! - The new iPhone just came out, so it's now the iPhone 11 Pro Max. There's an iPhone 11 Pro. - Whoa. - And just an iPhone 11, which comes in five colors. - Whoa! - There's a lot to choose from. - Wait okay, there's a new phone, there's three of them, they come in bazillion colors, I don't have any of these. - So Ro just told me that she broke her phone and you had to go buy another one, and it's like right before this phone came out. - I know, which is really really bad timing. I have dropped my phone a million times and every time it drops, I'm like, \"This is the time it breaks.\" And then I dropped it again, it broke. My screen was flashing green. - Oh my goodness. - Green, it was so weird. I've never seen a phone do this before, and it was a couple weeks before the new phone came out, so which is bad timing. So I just ended up getting the X again. - I mean honestly, the X is still a really great phone. Actually, you have the XS I think. - Do I? - I think you do. - Oh wait, do I, okay-- - Bring that over here. She has a XS, yes. - Okay, don't judge me for this case. - I'm not, that's cute! - Okay, because I ordered another case, it's in the mail, it's really sleek. It's like black with a little bit of white marble, and my pop socket, ready for this, my new one, is black, and the top is black crystals, and it's Swarovski crystals. - That's cool. - It is fancy. I went for a fancy pop socket. But this is the one I have right now. It's just a cake with sprinkles. - This is the XS. - This is a XS. - Yeah, so if you were to get another phone, I think this would be the one that you probably would get. - 'Cause I don't like the big ones because they're too big in my hand. - Well, we've got some options for you. So this is the 11 Pro. - And this is the same size as this one? - It is the same size. - (gasps) Whoa! - This is the new color. This is midnight green. - Oh my gosh! These looks like the little grills in those little pictures that I've been seeing online Justine. Mini little sauce pots on top of them, and that's what it looks like, it looks like a little stove. - It does really look like a stove. - There's three cameras? - What's this one? - So that's the flash. And so there's a wide, an ultra wide, and telephoto, so there's three. - Why would you need a wide and a ultra wide? - You do, you definitely do. - We want to slim! I want to look slim. Ultra wide? - It doesn't make you wide. There's also this one. So this is the iPhone 11, this one has two cameras. - Oh my gosh, it's like this beautiful lavender, I've never seen this before. - That's 'cause it just came out. - They never had this color before. - They didn't, this is new. So there's a lavender, and they have a really new mint green, a yellow, a red, and then a silver, and then a black. And this one comes in silver, the midnight green, and a gold, - Midnight green. - And a space gray. I can't wait to show you this. - Whoa. This only has two cameras? - That is the 11, and this is the Pro. So these are the Pro versions. - Pros have three. - So this one's a little bit faster. Has three cameras, it has a faster processor, and it has an OLED retina screen, whereas this one just has an LCD screen. So the quality isn't as good as this, but it's still an incredibly fast phone, and it has the new wide angle on there. I got to show you the camera, because that's the main thing about this. - Let me see this wide angle that you're talking about here. - This is the regular. - Okay. - And this is the zoom, so that's the telephoto, so you can zoom in. And here's the wide. - (gasps) Whoa. - Yeah. Doop. Ba-doop. Let me take a picture of you, okay. Ready? - Oh my gosh. Like I can see all of you. - Well, are you sure? Okay, I'm standing here. - Okay, now you can take a picture of me. - Okay. Mike, I can see you, are you gonna smile? I got Mike in there. - Yeah, because it's so wide. Now, hit the middle one so you can see-- - I keep taking your photo. I'm taking like 100 of you. It's so cute, and Cookie's on the ground, you can see little Cookie too. - Yeah, because it's a wide angle. - Whoa! So this would be really good for like, room photos, like real estate pictures. - 'Cause you can see everything. - 'Cause you can see the whole room. Okay, that one's okay. - Look at Cookie! Oh look at you! - Look at my feet, oh god. - So it does distort it a little bit, but I think what's the best part about the ultra wide is for landscape photos, or if your trying to get in a whole table of people at dinner. - Okay, then you fit in there, okay, that's really cool. - And this is cool, so in the new front facing. - Okay, let's see. - And then there's a little wide angle on this also. So we can fit some more people in. And then, this is also kinda neat. So when you automatically turn this, it will automatically give you some more room, 'cause it'll think that there's more people in the frame. - She turned it, and it zoomed back to give us more space. - It's pretty cool. - Okay, this is amazing, because as someone who has a very short arm, and when I'm trying to take selfies with somebody, there's not a lot of space between my hand and the lens. And I have the short arm, and I'm always like, \"Can someone else take it, 'cause my arms are so short.\" - Yeah, so it actually gives you more space to work with. - Wait, which phones can do that? The new ones, which new-- - They both can, all of them. Yeah, they all have... Ooh, I almost dropped it. - All three of them can do the pop back? - Yeah, so this one does it as well. The difference between this is it doesn't have the telephoto lens, but it also has the ultra wide. This also has a front facing 4K camera now. So before, it was only 1080. They also have front facing slo-mo. So now, okay, tell me what you think it is. - What?! - They're calling them slofies. - Slofies? What the heck, like, what do you mean? - Okay, this is what I mean. - Okay, show me a slofie. Let's take a slofie. Oh no, I'm terrified. - So basically, when I hit the button, just kinda go like that or something. - Move. - Yeah, are you ready? - Oh, I'm gonna give you a look, you ready? Okay. (lighthearted music) - All right, let's see our slofie. - I don't even know what we've started yet. Me. - But we are slofie-ing. We slofie-d. - Wow, yours is better, you were moving more. - We could do another one. - Can I do one more time? - Yeah. - I want one more slofie. I didn't know how to do it. - We can slofie all day. - Okay, I'm gonna move my hair. I'm so ready now. - Okay, go! (lighthearted music) Oh, that's a good one. - This is great. - Yes. They have some new editing features, so you can actually add filters onto your video. So this is in, - Yes! - iOS 13 update so you'll actually have this update as well. - They're gonna have filters? - Yes. - Thank goodness. - Look at this! - Because sometimes, I'm taking videos and I don't have the best lighting, and it's just dark, and you can't see how cute my dogs are, you can't see how cute, so I use the filter to make it brighter. - Yeah, so you can adjust, you can do an auto, you can adjust exposure, so this all-- - So you can make it lighter. - Yeah, so this is all built in to iOS 13. I mean, it's basically anything that you used to be able to do on the photos, you can now do in the video. And then you can save it. - This is so cool. - So you'll have an update. - (gasps) iOS 13?! - Yeah, so all you have to do is update your phone. - Update phone, update! - That's not quite-- (laughs) - Update, update now! Update now! - And obviously, this will work on the older versions when you have iOS 13, but it's much faster using the A13 Bionic chip, hello! - Oh my gosh. - Look at you, look at you slofie-ing. - This is so cool. - Oh, and look. Yeah, that was good. - Oh my gosh. I am here for the slofie and I'm really excited about it. And you know what I really want to try it on? When this update happens on my phone, I want to film my dogs, 'cause they do the funniest like, when they lick their little mouths or their tongues they like (imitates dog licking). - So you can do slo-mo, but you wouldn't be able to do it on the front-facing camera, 'cause that's new on the iPhone Pros and iPhone 11. So that's an iPhone 11 thing, but yeah, you can still do slo-mo on yours. - Okay, deal. - And it would be better anyway because you're gonna be filming them. - But if I break my phone again, then I can get a new one, and then I can slofie all I want. - I mean, you could say, \"Mike, why don't you use this iPhone \"and get me another one.\" - Mike, here's a gift for you. - Which color do you think you would get? - He's like holding his Android and he's like, \"Never.\" (laughs) - He is. Well, Mike and I unboxed his, was it, it was the S10. It was a few months after it came out, but it's okay, because we still did it. It was one of his first unboxing videos. It was pretty great. - Yeah, you showed him the ropes, how to unbox something. He did good, he did a computer. - I was very impressed. - And I was really proud of him 'cause he did that after. I really love this color. Now, what do they call this? Lavender, or just like-- - They called it purple, but it's definitely lavender. - Yeah, purple. - So here's the new colors. And there's this mint green, which is really-- - Ooh, mint green is really pretty, really pretty. - Pretty. The yellow's nice, then the lavender, the red. - Ooh, I love the red too. - This is the color that I want. This pink, if they had-- - Like a hot, beautiful pink. - Oh, it'd be so great. - A bright pink. - Yeah, I mean basically, the main difference is obviously, it's faster, and you have the new lenses, but the ultra wide is gonna be really cool, especially for video. - Which lens do you look at? I got a question, official question from somebody who's not very good with technology. Which camera do you look at? - I would say you just look at the middle. - [Both] Right in the middle of three of them. - That's your best bet. - Because you know when you have a friend taking a picture, look at of these, there's all of these going on. I'm like, where do I look? - Just look somewhere in this general vicinity, - Just look right down the middle, - And you'll be good. - And I'll be looking like I'm looking at every lens? - Yeah, I mean on the front-facing though, it's up here, so you just have to look kind of, up at the top, right by the speaker. - Just look at the speaker you think? - Yeah, so just look at the speaker. - Okay, I'm gonna look at the speaker. Okay, and I'm gonna smile at the speaker. Does that look like I'm looking at the camera? - Um, yes, look at that. - Oh my gosh, it does! - I know! - Okay, we're good. I love this. I'm so fascinated by new technology, even though I don't stay on top of it. The only way I know what's going on is when Justine comes over, and she shows me all of the cool stuff on my phone, and new phones. The only reason I even know how to record my own screen or about those cute little emoji-- - The Memojies, yes! - The Memojies. The only reason I even knew those were on my phone, is 'cause of Justine. 'Cause I just use my phone to call people, and send emails, and do my social media stuff. Other than that, I had no idea all the cool things that my phone could do. So, I love this. - We made a really cute Memoji video, it was like a few months ago at this point, on the iOS 13 beta. It was so much fun, everyone loved it. - In shock! Wait, it this the small one and this is the big one? - So yeah, this is the 11, this is the 11 Pro, and this is the Pro Max. - Is the Max the biggest in size? - This is the biggest. So it's basically the same size as the previous one. - I used to have a big one, but I actually switch to do a smaller one. Because my hands are small. I have little nugget hands. - Well, thanks for checking out the new iPhone with me. I'm gonna have to bring over some more tech for you. - Thank you-- - Guys, what tech should I bring over next to show Ro? - (gasps) Oh my gosh, anything please, please. Comment down below. - Okay, I'll think about it. - Tell Justine what to bring over. I want to see everything. - Oh my gosh, how fun. - What tech stuff do you got? - I don't know. - Got any robots? - I might. - Got any drones? - I've got all of the things. - Can you teach me how to fly a drone? - Yes, I will. - Or is it to expensive, it's too fancy? - It would be worth it to have you fly a drone. - Oh my gosh, what if I crash it though? Oh no, bad idea. - That's okay. (Ro stutters) Ro flies a drone. - What about something on the ground? - I have a little robot that you can drive around. It's like a ground drone. - Better, because I'm gonna fly one into the tree or something. - Well guys, thank you so much for watching. Ro, thank you so much for checking out the iPhone with me. - Oh my gosh, thanks for bringing these over. - It's so great. If you guys want to see some more iPhone videos, or check out some of Ro's videos, we have done so many videos together, so I'll put a link to my playlist, and hope that you guys enjoy checking them out. We'll see you soon. Bye. - Bye! (upbeat music)",

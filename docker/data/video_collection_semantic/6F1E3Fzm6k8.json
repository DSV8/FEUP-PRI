    "transcript": "- Everybody needs tech news. Which is why we're happy to provide it, until the government rolls out the new federal tech news distribution program. - [Riley] Finally. - At that point, we'll switch over to covering Reddit memes. Why would we do that Riley? That sounds terrible. - [Riley] We need way more memes. - Those ones where someone just like talks forever? Elon Musk must be getting on the nerves of even his most ardent supporters by this point, because on Friday the world's richest meme reposter filed a letter with the SEC to cancel his $44 billion bid to acquire Twitter. - [Riley] Whoopsies. Didn't mean it. - Yep. The move comes after months of loud speculation from Musk over the percentage of Twitter's user base that is made out of bots. An issue that many expected Musk to use as an excuse to get out of the deal. But doing that, won't be so easy. Twitter has hired prominent law firm, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz. - Johnson and Johnson. - Sure. To sue Musk and force him to complete the acquisition. Ironically, the same firm created the so-called poison pill defense that Twitter initially used to try and prevent Musk from taking over the company. So there's some snip snap, snip snapping, on both sides. In classic fashion, Elon responded to the lawsuit by posting a meme on Twitter, that pointed out he's finally going to find out the bot information he craves during the trial. And I'm starting to reconsider whether this guy should be the king of Mars. - [Riley] Can I take back my vote? - The law seems to be on Twitter's side here, but some analysts are pointing out that there may be a way Musk could get out of the deal. Considering the ramifications of handing one of the world's most high profile public forums to a weirdo billionaire, apparently trying to single-handedly reverse humanity's declining birth rate, even if that means letting him succeed at covering up his sell-off of 8 billion in Tesla stock. - [Riley] You know, you gotta take the good with the bad sometimes. - PC gamers cheered as GPU prices drop below MSRP, for the first time in years last month. And we really needed some good news. Even better though, GPU prices are continuing to drop in China, and here too actually, we saw some 3090s for under 900 bucks. (onlookers gasping) With some high end cards down as much as 38% below MSRP. Now it's worth pointing out that MSRP for Nvidia and AMD cards are slightly higher in China, than in north America due to tariffs, but 3D Center also is reporting that GPU prices are continuing to drop in those regions, with AMD cards in particular, down an average of 88% of MSRP. Wait what? Oh, an average of 88% of MSRP. That makes more way more sense. - [Riley] Okay. (Alexander laughs) - You can't tell right now, but this situation is so wondrous that I'm holding back tears. Hopefully the GPU landscape is relatively level, because while hiking is good for you, it's not something that PC gamers generally appreciate. On average. - On average. - I like it. - [Riley] Yeah, I know you do. - And the president and CEO of Rogers Communications Tony Staffieri, has apologized for the network outage that took out a quarter of Canada's connectivity on Friday, including my phone. Saying the company now believes that they narrowed the cause down to a faulty maintenance update, which caused some of the routers to malfunction. - [Riley] Ah, what? - Yeah, about how many routers do you think that was Tony? Because we're not just talking about cell phones here. We're talking about emergency services, payment terminals, my cell phone once again, and more than that just stopped working for a full day, and it still isn't working today for me. Is yours working? - [Riley] I'm on Koodo baby. - Good job. The outage has also put Rogers 20 billion merger deal with one of Canada's other big three ISPs, Shaw Communications, into question. 'Cause cutting off a quarter of Canadian internet is a rookie number bud. You gotta build up, get a whole third of it. Otherwise you might as well. I don't know. - [Riley] Everything stopped working, including the snowboard ramp I built. - Yeah. - It's July. (all laughing) - Now it's time for Quick Bits, brought to you by TeamGroup, who are currently giving away an exclusive set of their 32 gigabyte DELTA RGB 6,400 MHz DDR5 memory. It's got support for Intel's XMP 3.0 one-click overclocking for ultra fast speed. 120 degrees of ultra wide RGB lighting with a clean geometric silhouette, and on top of all of that, it's free in the giveaway, which is the best part. What? Are we giving away RAM? - [Riley] No, we're not, TeamGroup is. - Okay. And keep your eyes out for TeamGroup's new gen five SSD, and all new AIO liquid cooler, for both your CPU and M.2 2280 SSD 2. Learn more about the giveaway, and TeamGroup's Delta RGB DDR5 RAM, at the link down below. Quick Bits make you feel great, which is why you have to enjoy them in moderation. Trust me. Microsoft has done some snip snapping, snipetting of their own. And reversed the earlier reversal concerning support for untrusted macros and Office applications. The tech giant initially said, untrusted macros will be blocked to combat malware. The security community hated that, so Microsoft walked it back, but this morning the company said that walk back was temporary, and untrusted macros will be blocked by default. Although admins will be able to allow unofficial macros on a case-by-case basis. Just be glad Elon didn't offer to buy Microsoft, or we'd be needing seat belts to deal with all this whiplash. Am I right? - Whoa. It would look like that too. - Speaking of Microsoft, the Xbox Series X has given an upgrade, or a downgrade as it were, by Digital Foundry, who installed Windows 98 on the console, and got a number of classic PC games running, including \"Quake,\" \"Half-Life,\" \"Turok,\" and \"Command and Conquer.\" They followed a guide posted by Arcadius Gaming to get the OS running in DOSBox, Pure Retroarch core. So you could do this yourself, if you prefer potentially getting in trouble with Xbox, and use your fancy new current gen console for decades old games. Why? Because it's fun. David knows. - [Riley] There's no reason. - Speaking of Xbox games, \"Halo Infinite's\" co-op beta was supposed to go live today, but instead is delayed. Because eight months after the game's launch, which itself was delayed, it is still not enough time to add a feature that is core to the franchise ever since combat evolved. Look, I know game dev is hard, but I didn't think infinite was supposed to refer how long it was going to take to roll out the game's updates. (onlookers laugh) - That was a good joke Riley. - Okay. - But at least \"Halo Infinite\" isn't pulling a Doctor Disrespect. He will be allowing fans to playtest snapshots of the game that prominent streamer is developing with his studio, Midnight Society. By buying an NFT, (all laughing) players will be able to access these unfinished portions of the game, a process that is usually handled by professional playtesters, and paid for by the studio. Not the other way around Jesus. (all laughing) But hey, Midnight Society's Project Moon promises to be a super best battle royale, oh my God. It's a battle royale with NFTs, that's basically making you pay for early access. - [Riley] Yeah. - Oh. - [Riley] You don't want to miss out buddy. - If it sucks, you can sell the NFT to the people who will definitely still want to buy it. - For sure. - Yeah. And if you're interested in other fake games, check out these title made for Steam's recent summer sale, written by Erik Wolpaw and Jay Pinkerton. And illustrated by Claire Hummel. From boomer classics like \"Pro Poker Amateur,\" to darlings like, \"Help Get the King to the Toilet.\" There's something for everyone looking to get hyped about ideas, instead of playable simulations. I just know I'll be the next top rank in \"Dead Seagull Zoo Magnate.\" Are any of these actual things? What did I just read? - I didn't even make it, but Alex, you can do it. You're good at that game. - And you, are our top rank viewer for watching to the end. Wow, I love you so much. I'll let you in on a secret, come back on Wednesday and we'll have even more tech news. Don't spread it around though. I need my Quick Bits.",

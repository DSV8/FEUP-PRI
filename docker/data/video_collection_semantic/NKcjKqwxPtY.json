    "transcript": "- Adjust. Ooh, (man laughs) - I think you might've worsened my posture, but I like it. (Jono and man laughs) - Hi there, welcome to another ShortCircuit unboxing. Today, we're gonna be looking at the Secretlab's Titan Evo 2022 series, regular size gaming chair. This thing's actually pretty sick, I am out of breath. I'm actually really excited to open this because I've personally never used a Secretlab's chair. I don't think I've ever even really sat in one, before this video, so I'm stoked. Let's just dive into it. When are we getting a LTT store knife? Yeah, let's go. Cool. The 2022 series, zero compromises. Every Secretlab chair is put through a series of rigorous tests and international certification, so you know it's truly built to last. Five foot seven to six foot two. So full disclaimer, I'm only five foot six. So, I'll be a little little short for this chair, but that's okay. Up to 220 pounds, we're all good there. I'm the same height as Linus. So yeah. - [Jono] Really? Linus is as short as you? - Yeah, he might be even a little bit shorter than me. It depends the socks and sandals, I don't know. You know, they do a five feet drop tests. Wow, they should get Linus for that. Can we do that? Titan Evo 2022 series and bam, instructions right on the back. Look at that QR code straight to an assembly video, perfect. Are we gonna follow this? Maybe we will. Having a friend to help can make the assembly process even easier. Well, jokes on them. I don't have any friends. Oh, Secretlab access. - [Jono] That's cool. - That's pretty dope. What is it? Is it like a, it's matches just like a plane ticket. User manual. That's the access we got Secretlab access guys, all of us, everybody watching, Secretlab access. It's pretty cool. They actually tell you how to take care of the upholstery options. So, they've got their kind of softweave plus, they've got the nappa leather, and the microfiber leather, at which I don't know yet but I think we have the leatherette. So, this is the top of the armrests, which they have hot swappable armrests that you can get for this thing which is really cool. We'll go more into that once it's actually built. This is kind of a disastrous, I rip everything off. So, (plastic crackling) pull handles to slide back rows out gently. What did they say for me to do? I'm just gonna go. You know what, this is ShortCircuit. (plastic crackling) No, my chair. Hey, if they can drop it five feet, it's gonna be okay. All right? - [Jono] They drop the box five feet. Oh right, so we got our answer. So, this is the hybrid leatherette version of this gaming chair. Grab the magnetic head pillow, which is pretty cool. So, the only thing is that I don't really use head cushions very often, but maybe this all changed my mind. That's a wide seat for a wide boy. I don't need help, Jono. It said, friends. The amount of things I forget about unboxing these different chairs, it's just hilarious. Okay, we're good. Big thing when you're building anything up, just keep your work area clean, just keep it nice and clean. Stay organized. Do not remove the strap until the back rest has been securely installed. I really wanna remove it. Rules were meant to be broken. So, let's put the casters on here first. All right. Turn the wheel base right side up and insert the hydraulic piston. What are you doing, Jono? - You're a piston. - Don't call me a piston. This is fun. This is a good time. Okay, cool. So, we are going to slide this. - Into your DM's Slide right into DM's which are located here. Okay, I got one. Can you tilt it up a bit more? Am I gonna break the chair? Always do the top screw first. So, when you're installing this, do this one first then this one. Don't start there because then you won't be able to get it to tilt properly. Viewers are like, \"I already knew that, 'kay?\" - I already skipped five minutes. (man laughs) - Best thing about friends, you just let them do it. Next step, remove the reclines trap. Done. See, we already got ahead of the game. I love using the provided tools 'cause usually they're really bad. This tool is not bad at all, honestly. It's like that magnet is high quality. Do not discard the reclined safety tab and screw as they can be reinstalled for child safety. That's actually, thanks for looking out for me. Lift the chair, and gently downward. Nice and gently. What's this guy? Secretlab neo hybrid leatherette. Plush and supple. Yeah, so this is the way that it goes, fantastic. So, now we probably screw it in, I'm assuming. I pinched myself, using this tool. But it's not the chair's fault. Actually, it's really helpful that they write tilt lock and height here as well as on the diagram, so you can match it like exactly. Instead of having to kind of guess 'cause you don't know and can't orient yourself properly. Insert. Nope, I don't need no friends. You got a friend in me, okay. Final, the final piece. Pretty easy to put down but when he actually tried to pull it off, you definitely need a little bit of force to do that. No wonder it says, \"Warning: Strong magnet.\" Three, two, one. (man laughs) Now, as per chair tradition. The last thing to do is to sit in the chair after a word from our sponsor, Genshin Impact. Genshin Impact is a free to play open-world action RPG. Available on PC, mobile, PlayStation 4 and 5 with co-op play up to four players. If you want the best visuals and performance with Genshin Impact, playing on the PC is the way to go. Update 2.0, includes the new map Inazuma that's associated with the electro element. Explore and discover new mysteries, quests, and stories within this latest area. Cute, amazing creatures are available in Inazuma. Travelers will run into them while exploring the new area. Interact with them and find more surprises ahead. This update also includes a new character, Kamisato Ayaka, a five-star crowd sword user. New in game events such as, Thunder Sojourn and Theater Mechanicus: Stage of Wonders, allows the four-star character Beidou to join the fight with you. New forging weapons and two new five-star weapons are obtainable through wishes. So, use the link below and get Genshin Impact on your devices, today. Go do it. So, now we're going to try out the 4-way L-adapt lumbar system, which is really cool. And so there's a bunch of hinges inside of the chair that will adapt based on the knobs to form to your back to your exact curvature of your spine. So, it's different for, but it, yeah, actually and hold on, I would usually lean a little bit, hold up. And my only thing is that I don't know... Okay, now I feel it. What are you doing right there? Oh, okay. That is really working, 'cause now I feel nothing. I feel nothing inside. Oh yeah. Yup, yup. Perfect. So that is, wooh, get my back supported. In all my excitement, I realized that I never talked about how the armrest actually adjust. So, your armrest, they go forward backward. They go curvy. They go side to side. They go up and down. I'm gonna curve mine in like a true gamer. So, that's some of the features of the chair. Now, we're gonna get a few other people in here to actually game with this bad boy and we'll get their thoughts, so. All right. First up, we got the new guy, Jake. Come in to test out the Secretlab's Evo, whatever 2022. What is this thing called? - Ooh. - [Jono] Titan's secret. - Titan. - Now, I'm a real gamer. I want my arms to do the least amount of work possible. So, I want them as high as they can go. So, that way... There you go. - Oh, wow. Look at that form. - [Jono] Seems like a gamer. - Can you tell I'm a console gamer? (man laughs) - What do you sit on at home? - The floor. - The floor. Is this comforting than the floor? - Barely. No, yeah, definitely. - Definitely, definitely. That's good stuff. Hey, check it out. Try that armrest off. How would you like, - Oh. - What are you doing? - That hurt. - Come on. Well, don't hurt yourself. It does with such force. So, what do you think about being able to actually swap the armrests for different materials? - I liked that a lot. It was actually super convenient. - What is your posture when you're gaming? Are you actually, you're sitting like that. - No, I sit pretty straight up. - Oh wow, that's pretty good. Hey, do you want some lumbar support, bud? Don't know which way to adjust. Ooh, (man laughs) - I think you might've worsened my posture, but I like it. - Well. - Where was it? - So yeah, you can adjust it yourself. So, it's the two knobs right behind your elbows. - That is convenient. - Yeah, that's the only gripe I have with this system specifically, but - I need to tilt my head. - Oh, we've got that. - Ooh, that's snazzy. - You like that? - I do. Nice. Yeah, how much do you think his chair costs? So, I've never looked at a gaming chair before, but, - Okay. - I would say $500. - [Jono] Getting yourself a deal. - Wow. - [Jono] $449. - Not bad. - Wow, there we go. - Not bad, there you go. - Yeah, this is really nice. Like, it looks nice, not too gamer-y. The stitching, it's real Italian leather, right? - [Jono And The Man] No. - They had me fooled. (man laughs) - Next up, Dennis Liao, MLG gamer. What do you sit on at home? Do you have a massage chair? Didn't you break it? - [Dennis] No, I didn't bring it. - I thought you broke it. - [Dennis] No, Brandon took it. First thing I touched, this is nice. - You like that? - [Dennis] Yes. - Take it off. Take it off. - [Dennis] I can take it off? - Yeah, take it off. - [Dennis] No, you can't. - Dennis, we spent an hour with this chair. You can, you just have to believe. It's magnetic, you just spread it off. - [Dennis] Oh. - There you go, nice. - [Dennis] Why do you need to take this off? - Because you can swap it for different tops. You said this one was nice. This is actually aftermarket. This is not what came with the chair. - [Dennis] Oh, really. - So, if you want something that's a little bit more cushy. Something's a little bit more solid. - [Dennis] I like this. - Yeah, that's good. - [Dennis] But I feel like you will get fingerprints really, - Yeah, I can already see, it was like somebody sweat on it. That's kind of gross. Dennis, how tall are you? - [Dennis] I'm taller than you. - Oh yeah, you're definitely taller than me. So, actually you would be close to demographic for this chair. - [Dennis] Really? - You'd be close to what they suggest for this chair. - [Dennis] For shorter people? - For shh... - [Dennis] Shorter people? - You're calling me short. - [Dennis] Shorter. - You're taller than me, wow. I take that as an offense. Unbelievable. - [Dennis] The back is a little bit hard. - It is, yeah. It's just firm? Oh yeah, here. We can adjust that. That could be the lumbar support. I think I've worked it before. I don't know which way it goes what. - [Dennis] I don't like you go up behind me. - That's okay, no problem. Oh, that's any better. But you can adjust the lumbar support, so. - [Dennis] It's not leather, right? - Wow, two for two here. It's, did you just smell it? - [Dennis] That's leather. (man laughs) - It's fake leather but the fact that it fooled you, I mean, it's doing its job, so, - [Dennis] Like, it kinda goes this way, right? It's not flat or it's like, - Yeah, tilt adjust is I believe here and then you can kinda, and then you got a rocket and you should be able to, actually, there you go. You got it. - [Dennis] I like this one, like this way more. - Probably need to sit somewhat, well, - [Dennis] Ooh, pretty nice actually, like very comfortable. - How much would you pay for it Dennis? - [Dennis] $888. - $888. - [Jono] It's $450. - [Dennis] Oh what? Really? - Oh what? No way. - [Dennis] You said it's premium, must be a premium price. - Yeah, but I mean, it feels premium. That's the whole value proposition here with this company, dude. - [Dennis] What? Okay, that's a good deal. - R&D. All right, well, I mean, so honestly that kind of wraps it up. This thing is high quality, like it feels really premium. It's hard to convey in a video, but if you're in the market for a gaming chair, I would highly recommend it. At least doing your own research and checking one of these things out. At least go to a store and sit in one, if you can. I don't know if they even do that, but yeah, it's a good chair. You can get all the details the link below as with anything else that we do on ShortCircuit, so. Thank you very much for watching. Make sure to like the video, if you'd like it. Leave a comment. Check out some of our other chair unboxings and we'll see you on the next one. Bye-bye. - Wow.",

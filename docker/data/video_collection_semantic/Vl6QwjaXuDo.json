    "description": "The Google Pixel C has been reviewed, re-reviewed, and reviewed again. So why go back to the well once more? Because the Google Pixel C is still the best Android tablet there is  at least, for me. Fifteen months after I bought the Pixel C, I'm still in love with its industrial design and unique magnetic keyboard, and I still default to the Pixel C every time I want to leave the house without the bulk of my MacBook Pro. But for $599 plus $149 for the keyboard, is it really worth it? The answer ... is no. Actually, it's \"HELL no.\" But if you can find a Pixel C on sale, as has been known to happen, I think you're gonna have a great time. Join me for MrMobile's Pixel C Review Re-Do for 2017!

    "transcript": "- When the Pixel C launched in December of 2015, it was a beautiful tablet, with a price tag far higher than its undercooked experience warranted. In February of 2017, it's still a beautiful device, and Google's new software has really helped it come into its own, but that high price tag, it's still here too. I'm Michael Fisher and, as you can probably hear, I've got a head cold, join me anyway for another look at the Google Pixel C on the Mr. Mobile Review Re-Do. I'm not gonna make you wait till the end of the video for my comments on pricing, the amount you have to pay for a Pixel C is absurd, this is a 14 month old tablet with a spec sheet to match, there's no reason I can see that it should be $599, with an additional 149 if you want the keyboard, which in my view is essential to the whole experience. So why bother with another review? Well, because sometimes the Pixel C goes on sale, and in those cases it becomes a compelling product for those who want to leave their big laptops at home while working, or not working, on the go. If that sounds like you, many of the features that distinguished the Pixel C at launch continue to rock socks, the LTPS display is super crisp, and bright enough for the all but the sunniest window seats. The microphone array is now fully utilized to pick up the Google hot word, even from across the room. Okay Google, what is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow? - [Google] According to Saratoga.com, in the end, it's concluded that the airspeed velocity of a unladen swallow is about 24 miles per hour or 11 meters per second. - That's pretty fast. The hardware is still gorgeous, and well thought through. My favorite feature is the LED strip which converts from branding accent to battery meter at the tap of a finger. And I've yet to see anyone do a magnetic keyboard as well as Google has here, it's equal parts futuristic and finger friendly with widely spaced keys that offer great travel, and it charges itself wirelessly when docked, as a bonus, the magnets that make the keyboard work also make the Pixel C a great accent for your fridge. Even over a year later, this still hasn't gotten old. Being a Google built product, the Pixel C gets software updates right from the Mountain View mothership, while Android Nugget took a few months to make its way here, it was absolutely worth the wait, mostly for multi-screen, multi-tasking. Being able to run two apps side by side on that 10.2 inch display means you can keep a chat session running while writing an email, or watch a video and browse Twitter, or in my case, keep a spec sheet handy while writing a script, now, the competition has been able to do this for considerably longer, and Android's implementation still has some room for improvement in foregrounding and focus, but the Pixel C does beat the Ipad when it comes to hardware extensibility. The USB C port means that things like mouse support, file transfers from your phone, and wired ethernet connections are just a dongle away. You can also plug in a jump drive or even an SSD which helps make up for the lack of a microSD slot. And while the Pixel C still lasts me a full day of browsing in Chrome and scripting in Google Docs, with power to spare, when it does come time to charge, I love that I can use the same power pack, and the same wall charger, I use to top up my phones. One less thing to carry is always a good thing. To paraphrase the famous pitch, I'm not just a Pixel C owner, I'm also a customer. I bought it to review for Pocketnow right after release, and it's performed well enough since that I've never wanted to trade it in. I even survived two months using it as my primary computer. Of course, that also means that I've been exposed to all of its shortcomings, the keyboard's tendency to double up on keystrokes has never been fixed, as you can see from one look at the script to this video. Annoying too, the likelihood that the display will scratch if any kind of foreign object finds its way between the keys and the glass, an unavoidable consequence of this twist the Oreo docking method. Some popular apps still won't run in landscape even after seven years of tablets being mainstream, a problem also faced by the Ipad. And my Reddit research has uncovered no small number of hardware issues in later batched Pixel Cs. Now, many of these are common complaints when it comes to consumer electronics, but they seem unusually prevalent for a device that, when you factor in the keyboard, costs more than some laptop PCs, and that's really my biggest problem with the Pixel C, not the existence of Chromebooks, which are in another class entirely because they don't convert to tablets on demand, not the popularity of the Ipad, which Android purists wouldn't buy anyway, but it's price tag, which was excessive at launch, and 14 months later is now just ridiculous. Especially with new tablets forecast for the Mobile World Congress at the end of February. So, if you're in the market for an Android tablet that can occasionally serve as a productivity buddy, don't buy the Pixel C at full price, but if you can find it on sale, history teaches us those price drops don't last long, snap it up quick, and make the most of your exchange period to see if it's really the right fit. If you own a Pixel C, or know a sweet deal on one, share your experience in the comments, and if you're just showing up to bludgeon people for wanting a tablet instead of a full laptop or a Chromebook, why don't you stay quiet for a while? The rest of you, subscribe, so you don't miss more of Mr. Mobile dropping every week. As always, thanks for watching, and stay mobile, my friends.",

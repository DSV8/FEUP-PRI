    "transcript": "- Deciding what exactly to build for this video took a lot of thought. On the one hand, we didn't wanna go too overboard, but since the point was for some of the enthusiasts here to share their passion for keyboard customization, we also didn't want to go too basic and miss out on presenting some of the more fun options, even if they aren't the most wallet friendly. On that note, when you're making this decision for yourself, the first consideration after your budget, set a budget, should be your layout. What's right for you? A tiny little 40% board with several function layers to jot down your memoir? Or maybe you want a full-sized 104 keyboard for productivity and entering data in spreadsheets. Maybe you'll land in between. There are endless options with new layouts coming out all the time, but the most common are your 60 and 65%, 75%, TKL or 10 keyless, and 1800. There are also alternate layouts like ortholinear and Alice and split for the ergonomically minded folks. But I'm boring, so I've gone with the new Tofu65 2.0 from KBDfans. The original Tofu60 and 65 are pretty common recommendations for an entry level but very enthusiast-tier keyboard. Unfortunately, in the few years since their release, the classic tray mounts that they used have fallen out of favor. Thankfully, the new keyboard kit that they sent over includes three mounting options, top mount, silicone gasket, or silicone bowl, which we are going to be trying for the first time. More on that later. For now, all you need to know is that you can purchase your case, PCB, plate, stabilizers, switches, and anything else that you would like separately and build it fully custom, but you don't have to anymore. Many of them come in kits like this that include just about everything that you need except for, you know, switches and keycaps. I mean, those are kind of critical. First, a nice thing about the Tofu65 is the fact that it is hot-swap, which makes trying out new switches or replacing defective ones much easier compared to if everything is soldered in place. Now, soldering does have a few advantages, like some added stability, more layout options, and no risk of your switches popping out when you go to change your keycaps, but it's so convenient to be able to just pop switches onto your board like this anytime you want that this is absolutely what we'd recommend for novice to intermediate builders, especially those who aren't 100% sure that they wanna be married to the first switches that they choose. For those of you looking for a challenge, by the way, you can convert a solder-only PCB into a hot-swappable one, but that's beyond the scope of today's video. Today's video, which needs a message from our sponsor. Build Redux, Build Redux builds fully customizable gaming PCs for any budget. See how your favorite games perform with their online PC builder so you dominate in War Zone and not Candy Crush unless you want that. Head to buildredux.com/linus and start your new rig today. Our kit today is a bit more expensive than the 60% version, but for our $190 US, we're getting a lot. We've got an aluminum case with a brass weight, a plate in the material of your choice, both silicone gasket mounting options as well as smaller screws for top mount, laser-cut Poron bottom and plate foam, an EVA switch pad, a set of feet and cherry screw-in stabilizers. More on all of these as we go. And don't worry, if this guy and a set of switches and keycaps are out of your budget, don't sweat it. You can follow along with any of the still very good options that we've got linked down below for as low as 40 bucks. You'll probably be looking at a plastic chassis, maybe fewer plate options and no frills like bottom weights or added foam, but kits like these are a great way to both learn the basics and to get typing, and feel free to spend those savings, by the way, on our new circuit desk pad, which is a great fit for whatever keyboard you end up building. Let's start with our PCB. These can come anywhere from completely bare, in which case you'll need to solder on parts like LEDs, resistors, or controllers yourself, to fully populated with hot-swappable sockets, so there is zero soldering involved. Now, sometimes they're pretty rigid, but it's becoming more and more common to see flexcuts, not only around the F row or other modifiers, but also to break up the alphas like this. This contributes to a less harsh bottoming-out feeling, but without the mushiness associated with membranes. And it might seem like a small and insignificant detail, partly because it is, but this practically infinite customizability is a huge part of what draws people into this hobby. Whether it's the big factors like the actuation forces of your switches or fine ones like the viscosity of your lube or PCB flex, all of it is gonna make a difference in both sound and feel as you type or game. So I guess what I'm trying to say is speed holes are in fashion now, but if you don't like them, that is totally 100% okay. Moving on, failures are rare, but you should still always do a quick test of each socket on your PCB before you build. The fastest way to do this is to lay your PCB on something non-conductive, I'd recommend the box it came in, plug it into your computer, open a keyboard testing site like VIA. We're gonna have a couple of those linked down below. Then using a pair of conductive tweezers or a paperclip, bridge each socket one by one and check to ensure that the key press registers. Now it's time to actually build, and step one is adding our stabilizers. Now, most of the keys on a board are size of 1U. They won't need them, but bigger keys like Shift, Enter, and Tab will typically range anywhere from 1.5 to 2.5U with the space bar generally being the biggest at around 6.25U. A good rule thumb is that anything over 2U needs a stabilizer to stay, well, stable. To see what this looks like, let's flip our space bar upside down. Here you can see three mounting points, one in the middle for the switch and then one on either side for the stabilizers. Without these two side mounts, pressing your space bar anywhere other than right dead center is gonna result in a sort of seesaw lever action. This will fix it. But wait, if we screwed them into our PCB without lube, well, we'd be able to hear the wire scratching and rattling around inside the stabs. Well, I mean, it wouldn't affect the functionality, right? - No. - No, okay, right. But, but, but, but it would be awful, right? - [Plouffe] Yes. - And we can fix that in about 20 minutes if we care, and we do. There are a few ways to do this, but we are gonna use some dielectric grease for the bars and Krytox 205g0 lube for the housing. Then for bonus points, we're gonna be using flush cutters to clip off these little raised sections here that can poke into the PCB awkwardly when they're pressed down. If your stabs don't have those little feet, by the way, don't start randomly cutting things off. Many of the newer ones are starting to come pre-clipped, so you could end up screwing something up. In either case, the next step is to lube our housing like so, applying a light layer to the inside. Once that's done, you just pop the insert back in, making sure to orient the side with the hole here with the side that's open, grease up the end of the bar, so that's greased all right, then insert the bar and click it into place. Stable, now, before we move on, I just wanna quickly mention that there are more than just cherry screw-in stabilizers like we have today. There are different mounting styles, snap-in, screw-in, or plate mounted, or you might even open up your keyboard and find a different style of stabilizer altogether. Costar stabilizers look like this, and while they can be lubed up, there's not much else you can do with them. So thankfully these are less common these days. And optical stabilizers, like you'd find in an optical keyboard, well, those can't be modified at all, at least at this time. So cherry screw-ins it is for us. Now at this point, if you still hear a little bit of rattle, I mean, I guess I can kind of force it, but this is certainly acceptable to me anyway, there are two more steps you can take. One of them is a serious pain in the butt. It's called a Holee Mod and involves adding tiny strips of bandage or other padding material to the inside surfaces of the insert. Some full kit cases actually come with precut strips like these ones, but whatever you use, the idea is the same. It's to stop the wire from making contact with the plastic. Hamaji Neo actually has a great video on how to do this, so feel free to go check that out. We're gonna have it linked in the video description. I am not that fussy obviously, so we're gonna do the easier mod. Now, the old way of doing this one also involves cutting up bits of bandages, but since it's more common, premium kits often come with little padded stickers, either with or without holes in the center, since some folks don't like the actual insert hitting the pad. Now, our Tofu kit didn't come with these, but luckily we had some lying around from another kit. Now, for the record, not everyone likes adding these, and some finds that it makes certain stabilizers feel a tad mushy, especially before they're broken in, but I was told I had to do it. So all you gotta do then is line up the smaller side with the smaller stabilizer screw hole and the wider side where the stabs hook into the PCB and stick it on. Some people actually like to add a bit of lube to these before installing their stabilizers over top of them, but maybe you could try it without first and then see how you feel about it. Once those are on, we'll install the stabilizers by hooking them onto the bigger opening, then pushing both sides into place. Then you'll need the spacers or washers that come with your stab kit. We're just gonna use these washers that came with a different kit. As long as you have a magnetic screwdriver, ha-ha, lttstore.com, you just take the washer, put it on the screw, and screw it in from the backside. (key clicking) I'd say it's nice. It's a good job. - [Plouffe)] Good job, Linus. - One last trick, by the way, if it's still not quiet enough for you, you can take a syringe and squeeze a little bit more lube into the stabilizers after you've installed them on the board. Wait, why didn't we just do that in the first place? That sounds way easier. - [Plouffe] Doesn't it? (laughing) - We could just stick some lube at the edges here. It would work its way in, and then we could just syringe some lube into there with a needle, and what, like, you just have to like type on it for a bit and it'd be fine. - [Plouffe] But that's the thing is you gotta type on it for a while to get it to- - Yeah, that's fine. Oh my god, that would take like a 10th the amount of time! Anyhoo, now it's time to assemble our PCB and get the rest of our keyboard ready for the case. Remember those foams that I mentioned earlier? Ah, yes, here they are. Adding any layer or combination of layers of these is gonna dampen or otherwise affect the sound. Now, some of the more popular materials include polyurethane, Poron, oh, that's this one right here, neoprene, Sorbothane, and EVA. If your kit didn't come with foam but you want some anyway, there are a few websites out there that will do custom laser-cut foam for specific cases and keycaps, but realistically, white packing foam like this can be found for cheap or free and does a pretty okay job. The question, though, is whether this should be done at all, and that's not even just me being all, \"Oh, all of this is unnecessary anyway.\" Many purists will argue that an expensive keyboard doesn't need foam and should sound fantastic without it. But for more budget boards, it can help a lot. Again, it's all up to your personal preference, but since it's part of our kit, we're gonna use all three layers. We're gonna start with the top foam and EVA switch pad. Then once they're aligned, we're gonna put the plate on top to sandwich the whole thing together before we start popping in our switches. But before we do that, we have to talk about our plate. It's a good thing we didn't forget that. The plate stabilizes your key switches and adds some rigidity to the board, but its main role is to keep the stress off of the PCB when you're typing. Now, like everything else, there are a ton of options for materials, each of which affects the feel and especially the sound of the typing experience. KBDfans sent us polycarbonate, aluminum, and FR4 fiberglass to choose from. They've also got a carbon fiber option, but they didn't send that over. Other popular choices for other boards include POM and brass. We're gonna go with the poly carb today for a lower-pitched sound and a little bit more flex, but if you're looking for something stiffer and higher pitched, then aluminum would be a really good way to go. For our switches, we've gone with Gateron Blizzards. These are five-pin, 60-gram tactile switches with pre-applied lube, which is gonna save us a couple of hours. Some enthusiasts would still apply their own lube, but factory pre-lubing has apparently gotten a lot better over the last couple of years, and I think it's fair to say that this is gonna get us at least 90% of the way there. That's not always true, though. We have both un-lubed and pre-lubed Nixies from Cherry, and we couldn't really feel a whole lot of difference. But then if we compare the un-lubed one to a switch we lubed ourselves, it's no contest, apparently. Okay, I've gotta feel this. - [Plouffe] I haven't yet. - I assume this is the one that you lubed. - [Plouffe] The quieter one, yeah. - Okay, all right, well, it is better. So fine, if you have to lube your own switches, here's how you do it. Pop open your switch with a handy switch opener. These can also be pried open with fingernails or other tools, but a switch opener makes it about 100 times easier. Then disassemble everything but the pins. You should be left with a top housing, bottom housing, stem, and a spring. Now, don't just start throwing lube at it because this process can vary a little bit, depending on whether you're lubing linear switches, tactiles, or clickies. Linears, they're kind of hard to screw up since there's no bump. There's no feel for you to really worry about. But with tactiles and clickies, you've gotta be careful not to over-lube or you can end up removing a lot of the feel and sound, especially for clickies. So for linears, take a small brush. Take your stem and brush a thin layer of Krytox 205g0 along just about anywhere except the stem. Now to be clear, 205g0 is not the be-all and end-all of switch lube. It's just pretty common, and we happen to have some on hand. Once that's done, take the bottom housing and apply another thin layer on the stem rails. Particularly with linears, you can coat a bit more of the bottom housing and the leaves, but it's not always necessary. As for your springs, we're gonna go with the lazy container lube method where you take all your springs, chuck them in a container with some Krytox 105, and then shake them up until you've got a nice thin coating on them. You can absolutely lube your springs individually for best results, but wow, does it ever take forever? So we are not going to be doing that today. Once each component is lubed up, just put it back together, and you're done, or at least you're probably done at this point. Something we haven't mentioned yet is switch film, which is meant to fix flimsy, wobbly housings by adding a small layer of material to fill any gaps. Most modern switches don't need them, but if yours do, you just add the film to the lower housing before pushing the switch back together. Great, good job, now repeat the process between 70 and 110 more times, and you should be good to go. Can't say the same for your fingers, but yeah. Now, since our PCB is hot-swappable, you can do this last if you'd prefer, but as long as you've got a soft surface to work on and you don't press too hard, you'll be all right. We're gonna put our switches on now. Just take your switch, line up the pins with the holes. Some sockets might require you to rotate 90 or 180 degrees, so make sure you watch for that, then press it down. One pro tip, by the way, is that if you do all the corners first, it helps keep everything in place while you install the rest of the switches. During this process, it's possible that you'll accidentally smush one of the contact pins on your switch. If that happens, don't worry about it too much. First of all, you can usually use some pliers to straighten them out and try again, and second, switches generally come in packs of 10, so you'll probably have a few extras anyway. A quick visual inspection to make sure the pins are poking through later, and I think we're almost done. We're almost done, right? - [Plouffe] Yeah. - I swear, we're almost done. (Plouffe laughing) Anyway, we know we want to gasket mount today, but the question is, how? Gasket mounting involves sandwiching the plate in between the top and bottom case with pieces of rubber or foam. Now, for the traditional gasket mount, we could attach these little sockies on our PCB, but these bowls are apparently the new hotness or something, so we're gonna try those out. To be clear, gasket mounts are not the only way to mount the PCB. There's your tray mount, top mount, bottom mount, sandwich mount, integrated plate mount, gasket mount, leaf spring mount, that's about it. Now we're gonna put our bottom half to the side. For this part, tweezers are your best friend. You're gonna take these little strips of foam there and insert them into these little recesses in the underside of the top plate. With these in place, we're gonna go back to our bottom case and add the little bowls. Tweezers also appear to be my friend here. We went with the middle stiffness to start, 'cause we've never really tried this mount before, but our kit came with three different stiffnesses, 50, 60, and 70. Before we assemble, we need to add our bottom foam layer. An alternative to this is actually painter's tape, though. If you just lay strips of it across the bottom of the PCB with cutouts for your reset switch, resistors, any onboard microcontrollers or anything like that, then you can just add as many layers as you like, as long as they still fit in the case, to achieve the desired result. Usually anywhere from two to four is enough. Another cheap and cheerful mod that seems to work like magic is the force break mod. This is kind of like creating a gasket for our case, which should help reduce hollowness and ping, particularly if you don't already have any other kind of foam layers installed. To achieve this one, you take some more painters tape or electrical tape and add tiny strips on either side of the screw holes, helping to reduce the metal-on-metal sounds of your closed case. Now that that's done, let's take our sandwich, screw in the daughter board, then lower it slowly onto the bowls on the bottom case. Good gravy, lower it onto the bowls, right? I mean, that seems like it's on the bowls. Now we just put this on, and then ever so, ever so carefully, whew, whoa, that's heavy. We flip the whole thing over and screw it back together. Now we put these on. These are really nice. This, my friends, is how you do a rubber foot, okay? No adhesive, just a nice little groove, and it sticks in the screw holes so getting at the screws later is super easy, but it still looks perfectly clean. Whoo! Now, that's something. We're done! Well, sort of. I guess keycaps would make things a little bit more pleasant. We've got a few different options to show off here. Keycaps are the most outwardly obvious way to show off your style, so obviously personal preference plays a major role here, but it's generally accepted that your average PBT keycap is better than your average ABS keycap, since PBT is a more durable plastic that tends to wear out both more slowly and more pleasingly. But while the average ABS keycap will quickly turn into a shiny mess, that doesn't mean that all ABS keycaps are bad. GMK, for instance, uses higher-quality ABS for their keycap sets, though they are known for being quite pricey. On that note, there are plenty of other materials that you could consider when you're choosing keycaps, rubber, wood, ceramic, metal. I mean, people are constantly experimenting with both materials and profiles. You're probably used to the cherry profile, but what about SA, XDA, KAT? The keycaps profile is all about the shape. Do you want something that's more flat and uniform or something that's tall and sculpted differently per row? The only way to know what's right for you realistically is to just try them. So we'd highly recommend experimenting with some cheap keycap sets from your favorite online retailer before you go with something fancy. I've settled on these clear purple keycaps. These are clear 2048 for our build today, but there's a certain element of luck involved in picking a keycap set. Not every set is available in every layout. Is your kit ANSI? Is it ISO? Do you need a stepped keycap? Is your space bar long at 7U, or is it on the shorter side for a split or a condensed layout? Sometimes you can make an almost-fit set work with your board, but you might end up with some empty space that exposes the plate and PCB, which isn't the greatest-looking thing. There are workarounds. It's pretty popular to have accent keys in different colors. So you could just take that one that doesn't fit and replace it with something else and put on some other accent keys. Or you could fill some of the odd sizes that you didn't account for with one of the many novelty custom keycaps that come in various shapes, colors, and sizes. The only drawback with these, aside from the cost, is that you might wait months or even a year to get them in some cases. Before we actually try it, something we already touched on in the last video is adding O-rings to your keycaps. You could do every key or just your stabilizer keys, like the space bar and Enter, but this, again, is personal preference. So you would just take your O-ring, pop it over where the stem inserts on the underside of the keycap, and you're good to go. Depending on the hardness and the thickness of your O-ring, this could add undesirable mush, though, so it's not for everyone. It's just a fast and inexpensive mod that can improve your sound when you're bottoming out your keys. I swear to you, this looks a lot better in person than it does on camera. That helps a little, but yeah, it really, whew, doesn't capture the right purple tone. Well, let's go ahead and plug it in. Now we just fire up Monkeytype and... (keyboard clicking) Oops. (keyboard clicking) Well, I can't type on it, but it sounds really good. Why don't I try that again? (keyboard clicking) All right. - [Plouffe] Sounds pretty good. - Not bad, it does sound good. Now you can go a step further and use VIA to map whatever function layers or key bindings that you would like, at least you can if your keyboard has QMK firmware. VIA won't work with everything, but the nice thing about 65% is that you've got basically everything ready to go with the use of a function key for the missing F row. And that's it. If there's anything you think we missed or didn't have time for, leave a comment down below where we'll have links for all the items that we used today, but we're done, and all right. All right, it's pretty cool. I mean, well, like cool in like a, you know, you get it. The point is, if you're not happy with yours, you can change it an unlimited number of times until you get the sound and feel that you like best, because at the end of the day, it's your keyboard.

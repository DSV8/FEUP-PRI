    "transcript": "What's up guys Lew here, back with another video, and today we are back on the iPhone 7 topic. More specifically, the iPhone 7 Plus As you'll notice in front of me, - shout out to Be Sound, a company in China that developed this mockup and sent it to me exclusively - I have what i believe to be the first accurate mock up of the upcoming iPhone 7 plus Now it was rumored to be called the pro, many think now it's going to be called the Plus But this is the model that a lot of people are paying attention to, because as you'll notice, there are some key differences between this one and the previous version. First, and most obviously, the color this thing has this kind of blueish, purple tone to it, A very unusual color for apple, it doesn't exist anywhere else in the product line personally, I think it would be really cool to see an iPhone in this shade Two cameras, as you will notice right there, this camera hump Which believe it or not is a little bit higher up than the previous version. Here is a regular iPhone 6s Plus. So you know that the camera is substantially different, a dual lens system If you've got this much bigger hump, lump What's it going to mean for laying it flat on the 6s Plus, when I touch the top left corner I get a little bit of movement, but on the new one Its quite a bit more, chances are that camera is going to be substantially better. Of course it will have the versatility of the dual lens system and how they choose to implement that You can now notice this antenna layout and how it has changed, previously, you have these lines that come across the phone, but on the 7 Plus mockup, it goes around the outside the font is also different here, it looks to be thinned out, the iPhone font. Now at the bottom, this again is where things get a little bit spicy now these docking contact points is we're assuming they will be, are probably going to interface with other accessories as well. Maybe wireless charging, maybe a keyboard dock, who really knows, maybe umm, a modular camera attachment. If you want to let your imagination flow. One thing that was rumored which isn't represented on this mockup is this sensor at the very top moving into the ear piece, in this particular case, it's still above like it was in the previous version. On the side here, similar layout volume rocker up and down. The hold switch, now some people thought that was going to be subtracted, I think it might still be there at least in the case of this mockup it is. And on the other side, really familiar stuff, your power switch as well as your SIM card tray Now when I was holding these two devices, I noticed that the mockup felt a little bit thinner. So I do have some digital calipers here to test that theory. So here is the iPhone 6s Plus, I am getting a reading of 7.18mm the 7 Plus mockup 7.14mm so maybe its a tiny bit thinner, if it is it's insignificant and it could possibly just be a discrepancy in the tool. The most controversial topic, the bottom. On the 6s Plus, you have a headphone jack and in the case of the mockup, that's been removed as expected, as rumored there is no longer a headphone jack on your next iPhone, you are going to have to live with it. You are going to have to use some type of dongle or potentially wireless earphones. You do have two speaker grills is that some type of consolation, hopefully there you have it, iPhone 7 Plus mockup, dual lens system, this really cool contact point at the bottom potentially for accessories. Let me know down in the comments, would you pick up an iPhone in this kind of blue? or which color would you choose yourself? If you are new to the channel make sure to subscribe for upcoming videos on the iPhone 7 as information becomes available and maybe get my hands on some other exclusive stuff like this iPhone 7 mockup. Thanks for watching, leave a thumbs up if you enjoyed this, I will catch you on the next episode.",

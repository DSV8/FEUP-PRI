    "transcript": "- Did you actually burn down your own house (laughter) for internet clout? - No. - Oh! (both laugh) - Hello, and welcome to \"This Is\". Is Austin a big old liar? We're gonna find out again. So, we did this a year ago. - Last time, when I had to get the polygraph USB lie detecter strapped on, I told a couple fibs. Not because I was trying to mislead you, it was because I was trying to test the voracity of this particular product. - Voracity . You and your ten-dollar words. But, here we have now USB Polygraph 2. The sequel. (Austin giggles) - They still couldn't invest in, like, more than one plot. - Actually, the exact opposite. They invented... - Oh! (Austin laughs) - There are three different fonts on this. (Austin continues laughing) This one has artificial intelligence. - Oh, no. - So what we're gonna do is we're gonna strap Austin up to the polygraph. We are going to ask him a series of questions, he's gonna try to lie to us. It's a series of straps and gizmos and apparatus. Um, it's just... (glass shatter effect) - We're doing this thing again. - Yeah. - It's, it's, but this looks exactly the same as last time. - It, but this one has artificial intelligence. We're gonna go through this. There's a couple little bits, bops and boops. The first one here, this is a breathing sensor. So this will go across Austin's chest and is gonna navigate his breathing. Here's the A.I. control bot, box. - Just say it, just get it over with. - Take it off, boy. (peaceful techno music) Da, da, da, da, da, da, da... (glass shattering effect) - All right. So, we got Austin strapped up ready to go. Let me walk you through what each of these sensors are. This here is for breathing. (Austin pants) Which, if you notice, like, it... - Actually is lighting up with my breathing. - Like, these sensors, uh, kind of go off. This one is a pulse monitor. And then these ones here are galvanizes? Yeah, sweat detection. So, we've cranked up the heat in here. So, we're gonna ask you a couple of control questions and then we'll get into the meat of it. Interview subject one-on-one in non-distracting and neat surroundings. Subject should face away from the examiner and the computer screen. So you can't see it. - I will stare directly at the camera at all times. - Ask each question in the same tone of voice and inflection, I won't be doing that. Do you consent to me putting you on this polygraph? - Yes. - There you go. That's legally binding. Subject must be convinced that you can detect truth. Are you convinced that I can detect the truth? - This is the truth, nothing but the truth or so help me YouTube. - Tell the subject when deception is detected. - Oh. - Let the subject explain why deception was detected. Get a confession. All right. Please remain perfectly still. This polygraph exam will detect lies. Have you ever lied about something serious? - Yes. I hear the dramatic music in my head right now. - It's just, someone's watching Law and Order. (Austin laughs) - In the other room. - Duh, duh, duh, duh... - You're supposed to be keeping a straight face. (Austin mumbles indistinctly) - Don't make me confess you. (dramatic music) Have you ever stolen anything from work? - No. - Is that because you own everything? - Yes. Can't steal what you already own. - Have you ever been dishonest? - No. That does seem a little contradictory with my first answer but we're just gonna roll with it. - Yeah, um. Is today Wednesday? - No. It's not. - Have you ever fantasized about murder? - Yes. - Oh, no. For some context, we found a celebrity profile site on you. And we found some information and we wanna see if this is real or not. Are you in fact 5'10\"? - No. - Were you born in New Jersey? - Yes. - Is your net worth, really, $5 million? - No. - The biggest of spikes. - The what!? Are you serious? - Is this video click bait? - No. - Now, what makes it not click bait? - We're talking about lie detector and we're testing the lie detector. So, if I'm a liar then it will be proven and the click bait will not exist 'cause it will be a true, it will be truth-based. - So it's interesting that, that your your baseline looked fine until you started explaining why this isn't click bait. Is the Samsung Z-Flip 4 the best phone of all time? - Yes. - I'm a little shocked that you didn't try to lie on that one. - Why would I lie about something which is so obviously the truth? - Well 'cause, like, you like to be... - I'd rather lie about something not important then... - Interesting. Again, as you explain these things this is where we're getting some spikes my friend. - Quit getting excited 'cause you're asking me about what's going on and I'm getting amped about it. - Do you like tech so much because you're secretly a robot? - (deep voice) Yes. - That's true. (Austin cackles) - Now we're, we're gonna get into some meatier... - Oh, no. - A little bit more spicy content. Make you really sweat, sweat it out. Do you actually not know what is gonna happen in Mystery Tech? - Yes. - So, your answer just caused a spike. - Okay. - Meaning you know everything that's gonna happen to Mystery Tech. Have you in fact, actually really, gotten scammed by Wish, or Amazon, or Facebook and, for the record, before I even ask this question, your, you spiked up so goddamn high. You got nerves about what I was actually gonna ask you. - Of course I did. - And then, yeah. You were truthful about that. - I've 100% been scammed watching the videos when I got like a box of rocks or whatever. - Did you actually burn down your own house for internet clout? - No. - Oh! (both men laugh) We got a spike. It's not as big as the other one when I asked how much money you make but... - You're gonna throw an accusation and not let me defend myself. - I, I... - Okay. - I've got everything I need here for conviction. I will be calling you insurance adjuster. Let me ask you, is X-Box better than PlayStation? - No? - Did PlayStation pay you to say that? - PlayStation (Austin laughs) - PlayStation? You heard it from the horse's mouth after he got his check from the insurance adjuster. He went back and got another check from PlayStation. - Got that PlayStation money, baby. - Did Microsoft pay you to say that? - Yes. - You had a spike as soon as I said did they pay you again. - Um, if I lose track of who's paying me at what point, but I'm just gonna roll with it. Yes. I was paid. - All right. Truth! - What?! - Truth! (Austin giggles) - We got a Grand Canyon-sized crater. Let's get into some personal facts. - We haven't been personal? I'm sorry. I'll calm down. Go ahead, go ahead. - Did you believe that the rice from Halal Guys was actually cheese? - Yes. That's that's just a silly question. I (beep) you guys for putting that on there. (everyone giggles) - Okay. I thought it was cheese. It was yellow rice on the bottom of a bowl with a bunch of other delicious goodies. And I totally thought it was cheese that just tasted a little weird. I thought it was cheese. - How did you not know what rice looks like? - This is a lie detector, not the attack of Austin Evans. Why is this a roast now? - Also true. (Austin laughs) - Did you ever look yourself up on Wikifeet? - Yeah. - As flat line as it gets. - It was unfairly deleted and I will file a formal complaint with Mr. Feet. So the next question. Did you delete your own Wikifeed? - No. - Okay. That was the truth. - Yeah. - That was true. - Why would I delete my own Wikifeet? - That's the next question. - What?! How many Wikifeet questions are there, Matt? - Like 12 more. (writers laugh in the background) - I'd like to thank you for subscribing of for ringing the ding-a-ling button. - Sometimes when you're doing interrogations you really gotta invade their personal space. So, that leads me to the next question. Did you delete your Wikifeet page because you were unsatisfied with the ratings that people gave you? - Yes. - So, definitely spiked his blood pressure. - (Austin laughs) Yep. - And, truth. - What?! I was completely lying. I have no, I have no authority of my Wikifeet. If I did, it'd be back. - Let's get to the one fans really wanna know. - They didn't wanna know about my Wikifeet? - Oh they definitely wanted to know. (Matt and Austin chatter indistinctly) - Also, according to this, your your pulse is dead. - I think it was on upside down. - But, your breathing jitter has been at 15%. (Matt screams) Wow, yeah. You got scared by that. Are you a real gamer? - Yes. - Immediate lie. Immediate, like not even... You call yourself a real gamer. - I do. - Do you compromise? - I never compromise. - Clearly you've never watched an Austin Evans video. - Are you trying to tell me that our police lie detector is in fact a lie? - This is how you get FBI criminals. - FBI criminals? Okay. - Have you ever won a game of Fortnite against real actual people? - No. - That's true. That's true. - Do you think that This Is has any good videos? - Yes. - The machine has detected irregularities! - (Austin laughs) What!? - Would you like to explain any of your answers? - Yes. I would love to set the record straight. - Who did you conspire with to burn down your house? Was that, like, did you and Lou do that together like... - No. - So would you like to explain how much you're actually worth? 'Cause according to this, it just skyrocketed above 5 million. How many zeros? Is it 6? 7? 8? 9? - If there were 8 zeros I would not be doing this right now. (Austin cackles) - What did you do to your Wikifeet? - I had nothing to do with it. I was very proud when I found out I had Wikifeet and then it was snatched away from me, cruelly. And, ever since then, I have had a vendetta against the entire system and will be filing a formal complaint with Mr. Feet any day now. - The exam is complete. - Okay. Should we reveal the actual answers and how close it got? 'Cause I will tell the truth now that the real test is over. - Have you ever told a lie about something serious? - Yep. - You said yes. That, that looks pretty baseline. Have you ever stolen anything from work? You had a weird dip down. 'Cause you see that a lot. - I was so chilled about my answer. - And then, and then you kinda like, you kinda went up. Have you ever been dishonest? Also, like, it went down again. - Yeah 'cause I'm so cool at lying. I have been dishonest, though. - So this is where it gets interesting. Have you ever fantasized about murder? So you were cool, collected. And then, you said no. - Uh huh. - And then this is where it spiked up when you were giving an explanation about how you had never thought about murder. So it's clear like... - No, let's be clear. Not thought about murder, fantasized. I don't fantasize about murder. - So, are you 5'10\"? This is the only one that was weird because you are definitely not 5'10\". You're pocket-sized. You are like... - I'm taller than you. - You're like half an inch taller than me. - Well, you're mini-pocket-sized. - The sheer gravity of me is the only reason I'm not 5'10\". (everyone cackles) I'd be 6'3\" if I wasn't fat. I wanna get to that $5 million one. So, when you said no... - (Austin laughs) Wow! Wow! - The pulse is legitimately off the chart. Do you actually, not know what will be on Mystery Tech? - That's what I said. - Big old lie. Exposing it here. I've exposed Austin Evans. Have you actually gotten scammed? Yes. But, your pressure, this is, this is where it got interesting. 'Cause you told the truth but you did have a pretty big spike as I was asking you that question. This is the incriminating one. Did you actually burn down your own house for internet clout. We have not one, not two, but three spikes. Because these aren't massive spikes, I'm interpreting this as... I feel like you would've has a big spike back then because you knew that you did what you did was wrong. - I did nothing! - The six years, the six years that you've had to cope with it. You're starting to believe the lie. You lie long enough, and you start to believe the truth. - This is slander. I'm calling the police. - I am the police. - Yeah you are, dammit. I did not burn down my house I had nothing to do with it. - I might have believed you had there not been 3 spikes. - What if the spikes for me amazed the audacity of the question? - That's not how the science of polygraphs work. - I wouldn't use the words science and polygraphs in the same sentence. I'm not sure that's how that works. - Here we have is, uh, is PlayStation better, uh, Xbox better than PlayStation. You said no. - Yeah, true. - But, when we got to, did Microsoft pay you to say that, big old spike. Big spike right there. - No, no, no, no. But, it's fine. You asked me if Microsoft paid me to say that I said yes and there's a spike showing that I lied because Microsoft did not pay me for that. It's true because PlayStation did. See, that's what we call entrapment. This is where you were flustered that we asked you about rice being cheese. But, right here, is where I, I, yelled, I spooked you. - Mm. - So, it's the only time that this green line moved at all. - I'm cool as a cucumber. I have nothing to hide. I'm not afraid of anything Matt. - Except right here (indistinct). (Austin laughs) Does This Is have good videos? - They're all very good. All of them. Every single one. - You are sweating. - You should subscribe and ring-a-ling the ding-a-ling button like I have myself. I've watched every video three times, in fact. - Let us know what other questions we should've asked Austin hooked up to the lie detector test. Like, subscribe, follow. (Men chatter indistinctly) - Just subscribe. We're not doing the lie detector anymore. We're just gonna put... - We're gonna do this again next year. - I don't think so. (Austin groans) - I usually have the same noises when I'm de-strapping. (Austin laughs) (calm, techno music)",

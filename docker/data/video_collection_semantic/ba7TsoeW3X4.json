    "transcript": "- Are we rolling right now? - Yes. - The TV's much bigger than you think. It's very very big. - Utah in the house. (funky techno music) - Yo guys, Jonathan here for those who caught the most recent office tour, in that space is this giant, beautiful, 85-inch monster TV from Sony, which honestly has been the only TV big enough to fill that wall. I could not be happier with it. So when Sony asked me if I wanted to check out this beauty behind me, their 65-inch A9F Master Series 4K OLED TV, I was like, \"Uh yeah!\" For me, not only am I a tech nerd, I'm a cinematography nerd, an audio nerd, and I would even say an aesthetic nerd because oftentimes it is form over function for me. But with this it's kind of like this ultimate sanmmich of awesome that checks off every single box. Now if you've never seen an OLED TV in person, it will change and potentially ruin your life because nothing else after that will ever look as good. This thing is packing 4K HDRs, IMAX Enhanced, but the secret sauce, and my friends, this is some tasty sauce, is their X1 Ultimate processor which works in conjunction with that beautiful panel does a ton of complex things in the backgrounds that you would never wanna think about and in turn delivers next level visuals. From there, if you are a Netflix fiend like myself, this TV might have just become your best friend. Not only is it Netflix-recommended, it has a Netflix calibrated mode exclusive to Sony, which allows you to see what creators of that show or TV wanted you to see. Master of None is not only one of my favorite Netflix shows of all time, but one of my favorite shows just like period. So I was really excited to check that on this TV, and when I flipped on that Netflix calibrated switch, I noticed an immediate difference. It is such a beautifully shot show. From the composition to the colors, it's just super rich, super warm. And I noticed without that super calibrated switch on, it tended to shift a little cooler, a little blue. So when I popped that magic button, everything just felt way more organic and natural. On top of that, Sony makes the industry standard monitors for TV and film. In fact, one of the best investments I have ever made, is this Sony Trimaster monitor in front of me. I saw it on set one time, and fell in love because nothing else I've ever seen has come close. So when film and TV is not only being monitored through something like a Trimaster, but then mastered on some crazy high-end Sony production monitor, it only makes sense that they are going to be the ones to trickle that down to a TV. So picture quality is phenomenal, but could we please talk about the aesthetic? Because it is ridiculous. It kind of looks like it is coming out of the media console, which is both crazy and awesome because it allows you to get immersed into the content and the way that's possible is this genius kickstand built into the back. Not only does it allow you to prop your TV up, like a badass, there is built-in cable management. Are you kidding me? If more things in life came with built-in cable management, it would be a better place. Cables, you are not my friend. I'm sorry. It's one thing if you have a beautiful image, but if your setup is not equally as beautiful, it's kind of a sad thing. Fortunately though, we got both kinds of happy. What absolutely blew my mind more than the image quality, more than the aesthetics, how clean it is, is the sound quality. This thing slaps. I feel like there have been many TV manufacturers that claim you don't need a sound bar. And I'm not gonna lie, they might be right. If you weren't sold by now, there's also built-in Chromcast, built-in Android TV so you have this super clean intuitive interface and on top of that there is also Alexa integration. So if you wanna channel your inner Tony Stark and be like \"Yo, Jarvis turn that volume up, make it slap a little more\" you can do that as well. All and all, this TV is packin image quality, audio quality, aesthetic quality, just sauce, on sauce, on sauce, on sauce! Hopefully you guys enjoyed the video. If you did and you are feeling like being awesome, make sure you guys slap that like button. Definitely check out the Sony A9F Master Series TV with the link down below. This is Jonathan and I will catch you guys later. - What's that? - Steel is your real name huh? - Steel is yeah. James Steel, I'm the man of steel. - Just (flexes)",

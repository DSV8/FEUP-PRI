    "transcript": "the sensei ten is still serious way of chiming in two very exciting mice competition by bringing back the legendary sensei shape that first made its appearance in 2009 and it's a great opportunity for them to revive a popular shape and upgrade all the components on the inside so all the hardware is new it's exactly what they did strangely to not following in the footsteps of like the super lightweight bodies and open shell designs but holes everywhere regardless let's gain The Sound Blaster a 9 is a special kind of treat for audio enthusiasts with their best emi shielding yet a fantastic DAC and swap hall opens plus a well-designed breakout box that includes an XLR input your ears deserve the best and perhaps your motherboard needs a friend check it out below alright so first of all the ten is a $69 Mouse with a matte surface coating instead of the metallic surface of the original sensei and it's a truly ambidextrous shape with thumb buttons on each side so all the lefties will appreciate this but in this space where you put sticky padding to like change the shape of the mouse to contour to your hand what is still series doing different it's almost like the sensei ten doesn't really have any bells and whistles it's not what I would consider to be liked weight compared to the competition it's 92 grams without the cable so I guess the G pro hero is the closest and price and weight the shell also does not have any cutouts just plain matte black coating without any color options although the surface does not scratch at all which is awesome and the side texture I noticed is less rubbery than the top the cable is not paracord like instead it's just simple rubber that is not very good at releasing those kinks having played with the extra 5m4 or the Razer Viper you can definitely notice the difference a good cable makes and heck even my three year old rival 310 has a better cord which is softer than the sensei ten it is disappointing because it's like $69 Mouse with a really poor cable not acceptable and while the mouse feet are not fancy white PTFE the glide is still pretty smooth so no complaints for me on that and the bottom of the mouse is also slightly transparent kind of interesting as I haven't seen that before the shape would accommodate all three grip styles and it's very comfy for my fingertip grip it is slightly smaller than my model oh but it is very close in size to the Razer Viper which by the way is only $10 more and is lighter with a better cable and is also a truly ambidextrous body so the Thumba are on both sides I actually prefer Viper shape over the sensei ten because of those middle indentations whereas with the sensei ten the rear bump is a bit more noticeable the scroll wheel is very low into the body I prefer this approach with like middle click but the scroll steps are really light and soft don't really feel the tactility behind them the DPI shift has up to 5 profiles adjusted in 50 CPI increments with a corresponding blink behind the scroll wheel which is awesome the opposite of thumb buttons are out of reach so you won't accidentally press them while the primary clicks are mechanical switches rated at 60 million clicks and I would consider them to be like semi crispy take a listen and finally let's talk about that sensor still Siri says it's their best sensor yet the true move Pro that goes up to 18,000 CPI with true one-to-one tracking throughout the entire range it is different versus the previous true move sensors because of what they call tilt tracking with the true move pro from what I understand that means that if you place the mouse down and it's not exactly flat and the slight angle the sensor will still track accurately on any surface from my understanding in theory this is great for people who play at lower dpi sensitivity and like to move your mouse a lot and reposition the mouse in like your center comfortable position after like a large flake and so when you place the mouse down it will still track accurately even if the mouse is slightly angled when it comes down as for liftoff distance it feels like it's under two millimeters so the same as the Razer Viper but my model o has even lower lift off distance which I would consider to be better and I'm kind of surprised that SteelSeries do not have a lift off distance adjustment in the software there's still serious engine 3 by the way is awesome you can remap all your buttons set your 5 CPI profiles adjust the RGB illumination for the scroll wheel and the back logo and save all those profiles to the mouse itself and that's for my gaming performance well it wasn't anything spectacular because I haven't they've been practicing too much but there are no flaws either the sensor is great the mechanical switches are quality and the shape is fine plus the 92 gram body is just a reminder that not everyone wants to game with a 50 gram Mouse but I will say that after having used like the mm 710 or the model or - I do prefer a smaller Mouse like the G pro and the G 305 are really awesome - but the sensei ten is a nice ambidextrous design however the Razer Viper is a more appealing option to me as the shape fits me better and I was hoping for something a bit more interesting from steel series but the sensei ten could just be a placeholder until they launch something new in the future that follows the trend of super lightweight and potentially holes in the body to reveal whatever's inside I don't know we'll see all right guys thanks so much for watching make sure to check out this other relevant content all the mice are listed in the description below thanks so much and talk to you in the next video",

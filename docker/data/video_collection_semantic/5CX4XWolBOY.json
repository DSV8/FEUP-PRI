    "transcript": "- Want to feel old? The first Toyota Prius came out 20 years ago. Since then, it's become synonymous with hybrid in America. I can't go two minutes without seeing one in my native Boston. But personally, hybrid cars don't really get my motor running. If I can't be behind the wheel of a true electric vehicle then I want to be driving a plug-in hybrid that lets me drive pure electric at least some of the time. Well, the Toyota Prius Prime is just such a car. And I spent two weeks getting to know it. (light jazzy music) Visually, the Prius Prime is polarizing. I've seen it compared to an anteater, a deep sea creature, a dolphin on roller skates, but as someone who never warmed up to the look of the earlier Prii, I like that the Prime at least seems sportier. The model Toyota lent me is the top-tier advanced trim which mainly finds expression on the exterior through LED accents and fog lights. The rear hatch looks, at first glance, like someone used it for a trampoline but it's just part of the design flare which Toyota says increases aerodynamic performance. And surprisingly, rain does not pool here when parked on level ground. Thoughtful engineering, we like that. Let's hop inside. I know I've used the car-as-shuttlecraft analogy before but first off, if you don't dig Star Trek references you're watching the wrong channel, and second, this is the most futuristic cockpit I've sat in since the Teslas I drove last summer. Again, this is the top trim model so all available features are included, from the SofTex leather trim and seats to the heated steering wheel, to the wireless charging pad for your Qi compatible smartphones. I like this implementation better than Chevy's cup holder chargers. It's nice to have the phone out and visible so you can use it for GPS navigation. Of course, the available oversized display gives you plenty of room for the built-in nav system but I've come never to expect greatness from an in-car computer, and Toyota's is no exception. It's much too dependent on touch input which makes for a great looking console but one that's very frustrating to use when you're trying to change the cabin temperature or radio volume while trying to keep your eyes on the road. Fortunately, the button-studded steering wheel compensates for some of that. On the whole though, I think most of the things this system tries to accomplish on its own are much better executed by the common smartphone. Up to and including that mockish piano music that begins and ends each drive. (gentle piano music) Sadly, Toyota still refuses to include compatibility with Android Auto or Apple CarPlay. So yeah, good thing you can leave your phone out here. My favorite piece of tech that works really well in this car is the heads-up display that projects your current speed right onto the windshield. You also get occasional reminders of the local speed limit up there, and navigation cues if you've set a destination. If you don't like the HUD you can disable it and rely instead on the dash monitor, but I prefer to use that screen to keep an eye on my efficiency. After all, that's what you're buying this thing for, to get in on some of that legendary fuel economy. Well, here's where the Prius Prime first disappointed me and then sort of redeemed itself. Let me put the disappointment in context. The last plug-in hybrid I drove was the Chevy Volt which with me driving, averaged about 45 miles on its battery before the engine had to fire up. Now I found even that range to be a little disappointing and the Prius Prime is only rated for 25 miles of pure electric driving. Further, I only managed to get close to that figure once on a drive from a suburban setting to a highway that saw me hit 23.5 miles before the switchover happened. The rest of the time, I typically exhausted the electric charge around the 18 mile mark. Keep in mind, this is gonna depend on your driving style and how much you use accessories like climate control. There's no denying I was let down by that. Having managed over 200 miles of all-electric range in pure EVs, it was tough to come to terms with a car that could only deal with a 10-mile drive to work and back before it started puffing smoke. But then I saw that my average fuel efficiency for my review period was over 50 miles per gallon. And then I considered that I had driven this car from Boston to eastern Long Island to western Long Island and back before my first refueling stop, and even then that only cost me 25 bucks. Well when you look at it that way, the Prius Prime makes a lot more sense, especially when you factor in the pluses that have made this brand such a winner. Reliability and safety, a five-star overall crash rating, features like forward collision warning, auto braking, automatic high beams, and lane departure warning, all standard. Fun fact, when I pushed the Prime's patience by straying too often from my lane on an empty country road, it suggested I get some rest. Before we wrap it up, let's spend 60 seconds on the small stuff. You charge the battery through a cable plugged into a standard outlet, which takes about five and a half hours at 110 volts or about two hours at 240 volts. If you have a garage, the cord will be long enough. If you don't, it probably won't. There's a B option on the gear shift that introduces some regenerative braking, but it's not very pronounced. No one-pedal driving here. You do have the option of several driving modes to make the most of the hybrid power plant, but no matter which one you pick, you'll have to deal with the horribly annoying backup alarm whenever you're in reverse. (beeping) Because of the aft-positioned battery, the cargo space takes a step down to about 20 cubic feet from the typical Prius' 27, but you do get this sweet retractible cover. For human cargo, you get for seats total, the front two of which are heated. And don't expect great acceleration. Toyota has clearly built the Prime for efficiency rather than quick merges. Finally, that bendy back glass means there's no aft windshield wiper, but that's what the rear camera is for. So, at between $27,000 and $34,000 before incentives, is the Prius Prime a good buy? Well, those looking for the best plug-in hybrid experience will definitely want to cross-shop the Chevy Volt with its bigger battery, brawnier horsepower, and more user-friendly cockpit controls. But the Prius Prime gets a better miles-per-gallon equivalent rating, and there's a lot included as standard that you need to pay extra for with the Volt. The Prius' reliable reputation and its tendency to hold resale value should factor in, too. If you're more interested in the hybrid part than the plug-in, and you're really not looking for performance, the Prime will probably keep you pretty happy. Especially if your round trip to work is less than 20 miles. Don't miss all the other revues from cars to laptops to smartphones and smaller tech. Subscribe to the Mr. Mobile on YouTube.

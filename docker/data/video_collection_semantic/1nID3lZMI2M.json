    "transcript": "- Mm. What's up, guys. Lew here back with another video. And as you can tell, I've got a very funny-looking box in front of me. I might go so far as to say that this is the strangest-looking box I've ever featured here on Unbox Therapy. Some might even say that it's not a box at all, which it, might, think they're probably right. But something tells me, that there's a product inside of this giant log. You can see there's like a little slit on the side here, and I have to say, companies have been getting way more creative as far as the stuff they send me. It's really making for some entertaining Unboxing experiences. So this guy here, supposedly lifts off to reveal, okay, first of all, (inhales deeply) oh! (inhales deeply) That is godly. This video is already worthwhile from the smell alone. Inside is a product, couple of products, and look at that, how they chiseled that out in there. Okay, one more time. (inhales deeply) It's even stronger in there. That appears to me like that has been carved out by hand. Hence, the name of the company, Carved. They are based in Indiana, and they make these cases by hand. When it was created, the identity, Fred, assembly DDH, and the species, Maple Burl. Look at this! This has gotta be one of the coolest cases I've ever seen. You see that grain in there? I mean, it's hard to believe that's even wood, they way it's stained here. It's got like this crazy tone in there. This looks like the ocean and the beach. I mean, that is some abstract stuff. That's inspirational for sure. Now, on this side, you have a more traditional style case to protect your phone, so your phone's not directly up against the wood. You could see signatures from the actually company that made this thing here. And all of your usual cutouts as well. Speaker, lightning port, headphone jack, power switch over here, and your volume rocker on this side over here, so, you're gonna get (thumps) You're not gonna see, truthfully actually, you're not gonna see another case quite like this anywhere else. Each one is obviously gonna be completely unique because there are no two tree patterns that are identical. This one is now called the Wilma, Maple Burl, so same tree type, different assembler, created on the same day. Oh yeah, right there, Indiana made. Home of the Pacers, Reggie Miller, Rik Smits. Kay, so this is a different style now. It's a two-piece design, so same type of wood here. (sniffs) Woah, there's actually smell left in the case! (inhales) So this one you can tell, it clips on. This is the smaller one, so it's gonna be for the 6 and 6s, and this one will be for the Plus. Buttons are a little different, so they're kind of like remapped in that location there. Lemme get some phones. One second, let's actually test these out. Okay, so, 6s and 6s Plus. So that fits in very easily as you can tell. So, nice little fit, super special on the back. For somebody who's looking for something different, something natural, and something unique. Yeah, maybe there's a special female in your life, you gotta step your game up, what better way to do it than with all-natural wood? Jack, that was pure. Jack! (sniffs) Let's ahead and try this out. That just slips right in there, and then the top part, same deal. That's actually kind of translucent there. I dunno if they can, can you see that? Right there in the grain, see my finger there? That's, wow. And that actually fits on rather easily too. The buttons actually quite satisyfing still. See the variance between the two there, Jack? What can I say, I like 'em both. This is insane. Well done, guys. You know, don't send a boring little cardboard box. Send a dude out into the woods, and look what we're doin' now! If you guys wanna check these guys out, I will ... where do I put, what do we do with this wood now? I wanna keep it. People are gonna take a look at that. They're gonna know you're on some different level. You're on the all-natural wood level, and there are few levels higher than that level. Thank you very much for watching, guys. If you appreciated the video, make sure to leave a thumps up down below, subscribe if you haven't yet, and I'll catch you on the next episode. Later. Get yourself a woody. Jack, not goin' it.",

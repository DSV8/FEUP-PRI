    "transcript": "- WWDC. Or as I like to call it, what, who, don't care. - Whoa. - Just kidding. I actually do really care about this year's WWDC, because there's a lot of interesting stuff that Apple announced, and so we have the guy from the Apple channel, Mac Address. Lots of interesting stuff announced. - Lots of stuff announced. These kind of videos they've been doing since the pandemic started just go by so fast and they have put everything in there. - Yeah, and you are feeling that even more now, because you had to do a same day- - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - WWDC video. - And it's like- - Is it out now? - It's out, yeah, we got it out at 1:00 AM. - How was that? - It was great. We went to the park to film my piece to camera. 'Cause they actually did invite the media this year to the Apple campus. - Right, we're just not media. - To watch the video live. We're not media, no. (Riley laughs) - See, I kind of like the online feel because A, they can be a bit snappier maybe, but who knows? I don't know. It feels kind of weird when Apple is like, hey, come to our special campus. It feels kind of culty, and it's like, \"Work everyone up,\" feels like an MLM sort of like... - But, you mean like what they did specifically this year. - All our devotees are so, we're working them into a faith kind of frenzy. - I don't know if I viewed it in that sense, but- - That's how I view it, and I don't like it. - I did think it was quite- - You're just part of the cult, man. - I just think it was quite interesting- - You don't know that you've been indoctrinated. - Yeah, right. - Let's not get into that. (Jonathan laughs) But, what we should get into is what was actually announced at the conference yesterday. - [Jonathan Horst] Yesterday. - Today is Tuesday, as you know. Was there something that you were like the most excited about? - Yeah, I was most excited to see the MacBook Air get updated, but I was most disappointed to see the colors the MacBook Air is available in. 'Cause, there were rumors coming out for a while that the MacBook Air would come in similar colors as the iMac. And if we look at the historical precedences of the original iMac and then the iBook, which came out in a couple of funky colors at the time, and it was like my favorite computer. I was also a child, so it very much appealed to that. - We're talking about a MacBook Air and the first thing you wanna talk about is the color? - Yeah, yes. - What about the fact that it looks like a MacBook Pro squished now? - That's great actually. - Do we have a visual for that? - [Jonathan Horst] Here's one, ding. - [Riley Murdock] Nice. - [Jonathan Horst] All new design, look at it. So this is the Midnight color, which is probably the most colorful of it. Midnight is kind of Apple's almost black with a bit of blue. Silver- - [Riley Murdock] The problem is that- - [Jonathan Horst] Which is we know- - [Riley Murdock] Yes. - [Jonathan Horst] Space Gray of the Starlight, which I have not been a fan of Starlight since it came out on the iPhone, and then Midnight. - [Riley Murdock] Oh, that's not how I- - So, it's a lot more formal in a sense than the iMac. And there's an interesting, I guess, aspect to the MacBook Air where it is a little bit in this interesting kind of almost Pro space where- - Yeah. - We get these performance improvements and the media engine that includes Pro Res acceleration, while kind of maintaining that superlight, fanless, efficient design. It's funny, 'cause I've been kind of humming and hawing about the Apple's Silicon Transition, 'cause as we've been getting to the more performant aspects to it, I've been sort of discovering it's a bit harder to figure out and see the performance increases. And also to see the benefits of Apple Silicon's efficiency, because on a desktop you just plug it in the wall, it's always getting electricity- - Right. - You don't need the efficiency other than keeping your house cool, I guess. But I switched to this- - And the knowledge that maybe you're helping with the environment in a tiny way. - Yeah, yeah. Or that it's an incredible... You're getting a really efficient processor. - Right - Like that's an incredible thing. - Oh, sure. You don't want a another space heater. - Yeah, but like to remind myself of what made Apple Silicon's so revolutionary, I've been using this Intel MacBook Air, this 2020 model- - Oh. - And it is insanely slow. I am staggered at how slow and hot it gets. - Wow. - Compared to one of these things, it is incredible, it is mind boggling. We're now in a place where this is mind mindbogglingly bad. (Riley laughs) - Well, and they showed one of those graphs that they showed during the presentation. - Oh yes. - I think the M2 is like... I forget exactly what it was, but the leap up above the M1 version- - Yes. - Of the MacBook Air was like around 30%, 35%. - So they said- - What is it? - Well, this is an Intel laptop. But they did say that it's like 15 times faster than the Intel MacBook Air with a I5. - That's crazy. Yeah, I mean, it was it's smart of them to show these graphs showing just how far M2 has taken mobile performance, especially arm based, desktop class, sort of- - Yeah. - Not- Okay, I don't wanna say that, people are gonna call me out. - Oh no. - But like how far Apple has taken mobile laptop chips, since the last Intel powered Macs. It's crazy. - Yeah, and Apple Silicon, I'm kind of convinced that Apple Silicon is really about the mobile laptops kind of space. The efficiency is really for making laptops better. Desktops never really need, I guess haven't needed that much efficiency. 'Cause usually instead of efficiency, you take the same amount of energy and have more performance out of it. - Right. So let's talk about M.2 specifically, then. - M.2, like the drive? (Riley laughs) - The M2 chip. (Jonathan laughs) The new Apple Silicon M.2 SSD. You can plug it in your iPhone. - What a dream. - [Riley Murdock] M2 has now up to 24 gigabytes of unified memory. - [Jonathan Horst] Yeah. - [Riley Murdock] Up from 16. - Yeah, that's as a top option. - But have you looked at what the MacBook Air can do? Can that do up to 24? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - It can? - Yeah. See, that's crazy. - You got the two chips against the thing. One of them now can become a 16 gig chip alongside an eight gig chip, and then you're gonna have two eights and two fours. - Oh, right, right. - It's basically how it works. I mean, I think memory was a big bug bear for people with the MacBook, M1 MacBook Air, and it not having enough. And so I think this at least will help satiate those who want a fanless design, but a little bit more memory. - Yeah, I'm interested to see how well this does, because with the old MacBook Air, it at least kind of had that tapered body, so you could understand how there's some sort of airflow going on in there. But this is just so flat. It's crazy, it's like a tablet. - But maybe they have more material for the heat to dissipate through. - [Riley Murdock] We also have a 10-Core GPU now. - [Jonathan Horst] Yeah, two more cores. - Two more cores. And that was one of the big things they talked about at the presentation. They were like, okay, big thing that is gonna make the performance jump here is graphics. They really wanted to talk about gaming. - Oh, you wanna go to there? I think the issue with gaming is not about Metal 3 needing whatever up scaling. And it's maybe more about the structural situation of how the app store works and- - Right. - The relationship with the developers who make the games. - And whether developers want to go through the trouble of optimizing their games for this new chip. - For metal, yeah, and using Apple's development hardware, whatever they call it. They announced two developers developing games for Mac OS, which is \"No Man's Sky\" is gonna come. And \"Resident Evil, The Village.\" - [Riley Murdock] Which are like- - [Jonathan Horst] Big titles. - [Riley Murdock] They're not games to really shake a- - No, but they've been out for a while. - Is that even a proper term to use there? - Shake a stick out. - It's not games to dismiss because \"No Man's Sky,\" I think if you haven't really paid attention, \"No Man's Sky\" has turned into one of the coolest, best games out there right now. - Yeah, yeah. But I also have it for my PS4. (Riley laughs) I already bought it. - Yeah, yeah, you can play it anywhere else. It's not like a super, super demanding game. And even the footage they were showing of \"Resident Evil Village,\" they were like, look how smoothly this is running. I'm like, it looks kind of (bleep). - Yeah. Those games will be fine and fun for people who wanna play them on their Mac, but it's just gonna be a long, difficult, slog for that to- - I wanna move on to the things that I really wanna talk about. - It's your show. I talked about all the things I wanna talk about in my video, so. - Oh, really? - So just watch that. - So let's just jump to the thing that blew my mind of this presentation. - Tell me, tell me, tell me. - The thing that blew my mind was the iPad- - Oh. - OS Stage Manager. Let's get a visual of this up here. - You get a visual of that. - 'Cause that is crazy. So now on iPad OS 16, you'll be able to not only resize Windows on iPad. Before you could snap 'em to one side and do like the splits view, and you can change the proportion of what app you see or whatever. But now you have floating Windows in iPad OS. The new Stage Manager feature, which is also on Mac OS, which has this kind of like sidebar with app previews, which I also think is kind of cool. I mean, it's basically like the Windows task bar, but with the app previews always open. So you can kind of see, which I really like. - [Jonathan Horst] Uh-huh, uh-huh. - And not only that, but now when you connect an iPad to an external monitor with iPad OS 16, it will actually extend your desktop. This was... Jonathan. I made some iPad videos for LTT. - Yeah, I've done it too. - I haven't done it for a while, but when Apple first started doing this whole, iPad, it's a desktop class machine, you can use it for, pros can use it,\" I made these videos and I was like, okay, really though? And I used it as my personal computer for a while. I edited a video on it. I was like, okay, there's promise here. There's a lot of problems, but Apple has steadily added stuff. It seems like they kind of took a break for a while. And now they're like- - Ta-da. - \"We're back baby.\" The iPad is 100% just a laptop now. - Well... - It is, it's not running Mac OS, but look at this. - Yeah, yes. - You take your iPad, you plug it into your... They played at this before. You could plug in your iPad to a larger monitor, but it was only certain apps supported a specific external monitor. - It was specific photos and videos. Otherwise it was just mirroring. - Well, there was a Luma Fusion would allow you to have a different view on the monitor than you had on your iPad. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - But as a default, it would just mirror your screen. - [Jonathan Horst] That's right, yeah. - [Riley Murdock] With these stupid bezels on the side, if it's a 16x9 monitor. - [Jonathan Horst] Any monitor, yeah. - [Riley Murdock] This is blowing my mind. - I'm pretty passionate about the idea of the iPad kind of being a touch first portable device. And the iPad has a small screen. And so that just brings with it certain limitations that just need to be acknowledged and accepted. So, this Stage Manager Window mode, I'm not convinced that's gonna be that great on an iPad Air, 10 inch iPad Air, or 11 inch iPad Pro, definitely not an iPad mini. - Really? Well maybe, yeah, not an 11 inch. - The bigger iPad, it definitely helps make the bigger iPad a lot more useful. - Yeah. - In that sort of computer desktop style, ergonomic orientation. And then it's further useful when you plug into an external monitor. I mean, it really does make the iPad an option as a sole computer for some people who want, maybe do still wanna set it up at a desk. So, I don't wanna say, oh, this isn't great, because also you can still use your iPad traditionally. You don't have to grab the little thing in the corner to make your apps into Windows. You can just let them- - Right. - You can use the iPad like an iPad really easily just as before. - Right. - This is sort of another layer added on to kind of bring the iPad kind of the next step forward. And I think that's actually pretty good. I'm curious about the Stage Manager stuff on the side and how you're gonna be able... Like what if you cover it and how that's all gonna work but- - It looks here like you could kind of can come and cover it? - Yeah, I guess you- - I guess if you wanna grab a napkin to kinda shift it over. - It probably won't let you go all the way. For me, coming at those iPad videos, I was excited about the possibility of the iPad having the capability to act like a laptop if you wanted it to. - Yeah. - And also having the capability to like, okay, now I'm gonna take it off of it's dock and walk around with it with a pencil or whatever, and just use it like that if I want to. - Right. - I loved seeing the idea of a tablet and the idea of a laptop just kind of smashing together into something that wasn't ugly and janky to use. - Right, right. - And it has kind of been janky to use because it hasn't had this capability yet, and now it does. But I hear what you're saying. I talked about this in one of my iPad videos, where it's like, maybe it was a mistake to even try to do this. Maybe Apple should have leaned even further into, okay, we're gonna make a Pro tablet that you only use as a tablet. Don't try to use it as a laptop. - Yeah. - Like we're gonna optimize all the touch gestures. We're gonna optimize everything for that experience, not try to like smash it into a laptop situation. - There's a convergence, that's extremely difficult to find the line and make sure you don't cross it in the wrong way, and try and make it work as well. And so for instance, when the Magic Keyboard came out, also when mouse support came out in iPad OS, I kind of saw the way they did the mouse, and it was very clear to me that they were not making it like a precise pointer that you find on the desktop. (Riley laughs) - That was pretty funny. - Yeah. - Especially when the first implementation of it, which was just that big black circle. - Yeah that was ridiculous- They worked with it to take some advantages of what you can do with a mouse, but also maintain the limitations of what you can only do with a finger on the software. And so I kind of appreciated that. And so I think that's sort of what this Stage Manager experience is, is also just still respecting the limitations that a touch interface device brings and not trying to push it too far away from that core. - Right. - Interaction. - Well, I will say that, okay, so while Stage Manager is very explicitly, like, this is acting like a laptop now- - Uh-huh. - There are other elements that they announced during WWC about iPad OS 16 that may be more in alignment with what you're talking about as like, okay, we're gonna keep it a- - Touch first device. - A touch first device, but make it better. We have this new reference mode, which I don't know how useful that'll be, I'm not a colorist, but apparently this is going useful for color things. Because the iPads do generally have pretty good color reproduction. - Oh yeah, oh yeah. Might as well. You have a really, really great screen, and then to not be able to use it for something like a video workflow, might as well, right? And then you don't have to have seven monitors on your desk. - We have display scaling mode, which just gives more customization options for people, which is always good. - To some degree, I would interpret that to make Stage Manager more useful on the smaller iPad screen. So you're making the interface- - Yes. Those go kind of go hand in hand then. - Yeah, yeah. I think it's really just- - But I think it has always, even when I'm using an iPad- - Yeah, a little bit- - Just by itself, sometimes I'm like, I wanna zoom out a little bit, I wanna zoom in. - Yeah. Density will be good there. - There was also, I don't see it here, but there's virtual memory swapping. - Oh yeah, I know. That's something when they announced it, I went, \"Wow,\" and then kept forgetting about. (Jonathan and Riley laugh) And I think that's a big deal, actually. if you have too much in your RAM, then it'll put some stuff that you're not using into your SSD temporarily just to be there so you can reference it still. - Okay. - And so it basically means that you could have Windows open, because the way iPad OS had been dealing with RAM before was it would just flush... If an app you hadn't used in a while would just get flushed from your memory. And then when you go back, you'd have to reload it. - Oh my gosh. Yes, that happens so often. - It's so annoying, right? - In iOS and iPad. - But that's 'cause they never had swap in iPad OS. So this will be a big deal in just making the iPad feel less annoying sometimes to use. It has lots of RAM now, but yeah. But also, they have to do this for a Windowing mode, because you can't just hide the app that's gonna get flushed away. - Right. The app preview's always there on the side. - Or you leave the Windows up and it's just still running in the background. So they had to implement Stage Manager in the windowing, they had to also implement swap memory. I don't think- - See, I always just thought that was because they did that killing apps in the background thing because iPhones and iPads can get away with having- - Lesser memory? - Well, that's the reason why they can get away with not having very much memory, because they're so good at managing the background stuff. - Them being good at managing the background was you have to reload this app and you're no longer in the place you were in on the feed. - Yeah, yeah, exactly. Scroll all the way down again. Oh, you know what? I was wrong. - What were you wrong about? - The thing I was most excited about. - Oh. - From yesterday's announcement. - Tell me. Show us. - [Riley Murdock] It's a weather app. - [Jonathan Horst] Oh. - There's a weather app for iPad now. iPad didn't have a weather app before, now it has a weather app. - I know, I actually was really excited about it. - Everyone's freaking, people are rioting in the streets 'cause they're so happy, - But there's still no calculator. (Riley laughs) - [Riley Murdock] Okay. Moving on from iPad, I think, right? Oh, there was something about collaboration free form. That's like this shared browsing thing is kind of cool, shared tab groups. - [Jonathan Horst] Yeah, but like everyone has to have an Apple device. - [Riley Murdock] Right, yeah. - There were a lot of these things, collaboration and share play and all that sort of stuff, that was very much for like remote work and the pandemic. And all I could think about was the controversy Apple was having, I don't know, a month ago, where their employees were like, \"We don't wanna go back to the office.\" - Yeah, yeah. - So then Apples making these features to make remote work more convenient. - Should we talk about iOS? Oh, and also about iPad OS, it was cool to see them talking... Well, they've talked about Desktop-class apps a lot in the past, but now they're like, \"Oh, there's an API, so now you can make your app.\" - I'm still a little confused about what that means. I think I have to investigate that further. - I think they're making it easier for developers to incorporate things that you would naturally expect to have in a desktop app. Like native renaming, undo, find and replace, customizable toolbars. - [Jonathan Horst] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - [Riley Murdock] Whereas before, you get the app and that's kind of what the app is, and now there's probably gonna be more customization and stuff. - I will just say this. iPad OS has finally earned its name with this release. I think that's probably would be the best way to sum it up. - That's super big of you to say that. - It's earned its name, I think that's laudable. I think now we're seeing iPad become its own thing, and I think that's a good thing. And even when I've been doing videos about iPad, I've been talking to people and they're like, \"Yeah, I use an iPad as my main computer now.\" Like Nicole- - [Riley Murdock] Really? - [Jonathan Horst] Yeah. - [Riley Murdock] What? - [Jonathan Horst] The whole video is like, she got an iPad Pro a couple years ago. She didn't really use it that much. - [Riley Murdock] Oh sorry, not for editing. - No, not for editing. - 'Cause Nicole's an editor. - She has things she does on it. crafty things, workflow, she's developed these workflows to make it work. But she switched to using the iPad as her personal computer at home. - Yeah, I mean- - And so I think this will just help people who are already in that process, and the power to them. - The thing that will always keep me back from getting super, super, truly excited about the iPad, because it's cool to see products change like this and evolve. - Yeah. - But the thing that will always keep me back from being like, \"Oh, this is amazing product that Apple has made,\" is the fact that they're just so fricking expensive for what they do. In order to have an iPad... Wait, if you're buying an iPad to use it as a tablet, sure, you don't need to buy any accessories, especially the smaller ones. Buy an iPad Mini, buy the iPad, whatever it is, 9th Gen or whatever it is, the base model. - Yeah. - But if you wanna use an iPad Pro or an iPad Air as your computer, you're also gonna be wanting to buy the keyboard attachment and maybe some other things. And at that point, now you're looking at 1600, $22,000. - It's the same price if you were to get a Samsung with the same sort of performance in the accessories. - A Samsung tablet? - Yeah. - Sure, I guess it's more about tablets in general, I guess. If you wanna use a tablet as your main computer, you're paying a premium for the privilege of trying out this cutting edge form factor that is actually not very cutting edge, but around for a long time. You know what I mean? I'm upset about it. - Are you less upset now that the iPad is more capable, so it's actually coming up to its price point? - I think it's just like, I'm thankful for the people with a lot of money who will go and buy these products so that Apple keeps fiddling around and innovating. Okay, I wanna talk about iOS, because we've basically talked about most of the other stuff, Car Play's new, there's gonna be new UIs for Car Play. - [Jonathan Horst] I mad about that. - [Riley Murdock] Blah, blah, blah. - [Jonathan Horst] I'm so deeply- - Watch OS. They've got this drug scanning thing now. Which is interesting, but also scary, because then you're sending your prescription information into the cloud. - But they protect your privacy. - Yeah, and they also scan your photos for child stuff. - Right, I guess they're still doing that. I can't remember- - And they also, Apple announced at WWDC, everyone was so excited about it. They announced that they invented a new Smart Home standard. In collaboration with blah, blah, blah, other companies, blah, blah, blah, we created a new standard, Matter. - I didn't interpret that. - I didn't interpret that way 'cause I knew that they didn't make Matter, but it kind of sounded like that. - Oh. - And I was like, is there a joke here? Not really. Let's move on. - The joke I made was there was some things they referenced that I was like, aren't these features already in your operating system, maybe slightly improved? So for instance, when they talked about sports, which was fascinating. - [Riley Murdock] Sports. - Sports, look at all the sports we care about. The person literally said, \"You know, you can ask Siri about sports scores.\" And I thought, yes, I remember that feature being announced 10 years ago. And then they're talking about this iCloud Photo Library for families. - [Riley Murdock] Mm. - And I thought, doesn't iCloud have a shared photo album feature that also was announced 10 years ago? - Yeah- - Sure does. - And also when they were talking about all this stuff where it's like, oh choose who you share with, and like automatically... Here, I got it here. Automatically upload photos to shared libraries and stuff. - Yeah. - I'm like, I mean, Google Photos has this. - Yeah. - This seems like basic stuff, and I was like, what? You didn't have this already? - [Jonathan Horst] Yeah. - [Riley Murdock] iOS, let's talk. Lock Screen Widgets. We don't have much time, we gotta hurry. - [Jonathan Horst] Here's my thing. It's great. I love that you can change the font of the clock. They do this cool thing where they figure out what the subject of your picture is and they can hide the clock a little bit behind a person's head or something like that. - Yeah, that's kind of cool. - And that's part of the whole machine learning stuff they've been adding to iOS, which we could get into if we really wanted to. But basically, the widgets are like watch complications, was my take on them. And then notifications are now kind of this like stacky thing on the bottom. They don't take that. - Yeah. So it can do this thing where it does a portrait mode thing. I saw Quinn Nelson posting some examples. - Yeah, the machine learning's pretty neat. I've been curious... We haven't talked much about the hardware of the Neural Engine within Apple Silicon. And it's been added to A Series chips for a couple years now. And it was always there and they said it can do stuff, but we never really knew what it can do. And clearly Apple was sort of leading up to now this sort of thing. So it's really interesting to see how this sort of processing will be able to be used in kind of real world, so to speak. - Right. - And so right now, we're seeing it in terms of scanning text from video and photos, which is now available. And also now even figuring out what the subject is in an image and taking that out, which I think is really great. I'm also curious in terms of the Neural Engine zooming out. So maybe the Mac, to see how developers are able to access that and take advantage of that. - You wanna see Neural Engine stuff being used on Mac stuff? - Like in photo- The iOS operating system can take the subject out of a photo. Then you open up Photoshop and it's this big faff to do the same thing. Wouldn't it be nice if that hardware accelerates Photoshop? - It makes sense. - Yeah, it makes sense. So Adobe has to figure out how they're gonna... And Apple has to make sure the API's there so that the Adobe can take advantage of it. I just don't know where we're at with that. - I don't think there's anything else. I mean, obviously we didn't talk about absolutely everything that they announced, but you know- - You can't. - You can't. - They announced too much. This is why I wanna go back to live stage stuff so that they are a little more judicious about what they choose to show us. Your iPhone could be a webcam now. That's pretty nifty. - [Riley Murdock] Yeah, no, sorry. That was the other big thing I wanted to say, which is kind of- - Which will make sending mail a dream. I'm curious what sort of stands are people gonna get and what that's gonna do to the hinge sort of situation, having all that weight on the top. - I mean, you're not gonna have it on there all the time. - Well, it will make a difference, but it'll be convenient. It needs to be like easy to put on and stuff like that. So I'm curious how that workflow's gonna work. They had this thing where they're really taking all the cameras of the iPhone and doing like a desk mode, camera view from the ultra wide and some crazy, and also center stage with your iPhone camera. - Yeah, that was cool to see. - Really, really going above and beyond. - I mean, honestly, webcams have really come a long way fueled by the pandemic probably, where people had to sit in front of these things for hours. - Yeah. - And Google has this now in Meet, and various other chat apps have it, where like they're now virtual lighting effects where- - Yeah. - You can backlit and whatever, it can like dim the background and brighten you up. - Yeah, which you can do with this iPhone as a webcam. So being able to use the really great camera on your phone as a webcam, just in an easy way, I think that's really handy, but you'll have to buy a mount, and that'll be a bit annoying. - Oh, I forgot my other favorite thing from the... This is my actually favorite thing from WWDC. It was the dictation- - Oh. - That the keyboard stays open when you used dictation. - Dictation was announced at iOS6 in 2012. - Yeah, but I just saw this and I was like, what are you talking about? (Jonathan laughs) This wasn't a thing already? Like when you use dictation on an iPhone, the keyboard just goes away? - I did say, it's even worse than that. Sometimes you accidentally hit the dictation button when you're just fiddling with your phone, and then it goes, bing, and you don't have the keyboard and you have to wait for it to load up and then you have to hit the done. So it doesn't- - That was so funny to me, and he's like, \"And now I can just seamlessly switch between voice to text. And if, oh, I made a mistake, I'll just fix it with my keyboard.\" I'm like, it's 2022. - Yeah, it's a long time coming. - This is crazy. Anyways, so that's basically it. - Yeah. That's a lot. - You have to go to a shoot. - Yeah, where I actually am gonna be comparing the iPad to an Android tablet. - Oh, well which Android tablet? - Samsung Galaxy Tab S8. Samsung when it comes to- - Is that the new one? - Yeah. When it comes to tablet, Samsung is just the only Android tablet essentially. - I did the short circuit for the S8 Plus. - Yeah, everyone got mad at you for that. - Yeah, they got mad at me 'cause I forgot about Decks, but honestly, no one talks about Decks, can you really blame me? And I wish I did, because all the people telling me to check it out, I was like, you're right, Decks is really cool. It puts iPad to shame. I've used Decks in the past on some phones, it's been years, but I just thought it was really cool how it's like, okay, this is Android- - Are you talking about like Decks onto an external monitor, or Decks was on the screen? - I didn't know that you could do Decks without an external monitor. - Right, right. - So I definitely wish that I could have tried that out, but the fact that Samsung has had this feature and they've kept supporting it, and I guess making it better, because there are people who actually care about it, in the background for a while is really cool. I think Android has the capability to serve as a desktop operating system. - I wasn't bowled over. - What's that? - I wasn't bowled over - Well, you're never bowled over by anything. - No I guess I'm a curmudgeon, I'm such a curmudgeon. - By the Job-ites, Jobs-ites. - No, no, no, that's not how I am. - \"Jobs-ians\" I'll make a big faff about Android all the time. Faffy man. (Jonathan laughs) Okay, you have to go to a shoot. - Yes I do. - And I don't care about Apple at all. - And you have to edit this. - No, I don't have to. - Oh. - I edited the last one, but Hoffman will do this one. Love you. - Love you Hoffman. - Okay, thanks for watching, guys. We're gonna do more talk links more regularly as you can see. Subscribe. - Rate and review. - And put in a good word for us with the receptionist. Subscribe to Mac Address.",

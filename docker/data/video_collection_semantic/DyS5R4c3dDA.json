    "transcript": "these days it is not uncommon for people to spend lots of money buying CRTs which is a display technology from the 1500s because apparently they are very good for gaming which got me thinking are there any other obsolete display technologies that are secretly very good for gaming what about plasma TVs but before we go investigate today's video is sponsored by Corsair and their fancy Dominator platinum ddr5 in White NOW aside from the obvious hello epine that comes with these dark black kits they also perform very well you can get 32 gig kits in up to 6200 megahertz speeds in the white version and that performance combined with their 12 ultra bright capellix RGB LEDs make these a great option for any high-end gaming system check out the Corsair Dom Platts in white using the link in the description below thank you Corsair for sponsoring today's video thank you oh wow it's so much heavier than it was anticipating oh now you can tell that this plasma TV is not that old because it's got HDMI ports on it in fact we've got three of them there's another one hiding behind here and aside from that we've got a whole bunch of analog video in which does data a little bit and we actually have an RGB PC Port which is just a fancy way of saying a Mesozoic period board and finally it's got a standard IEC power port on it so no soldered on power cables here but with that let's install the enormous aftermarket standard camera okay oh holy meow that is that is very heavy oh and after a lot more grunting I finally got it in place whoa that is a big dirty TV actually that's pretty gross just give me a second now while I wipe the TV down let me tell you a bit more about it because compared to CRTs plasma TVs aren't that old in fact this LG 50pk550 was only made in 2010 which means I have underwear older than this TV but plasma is an obsolete technology and I'm curious to see how it holds up for gaming compared to Modern standards now straight off the bat I don't think this is gonna be a very good gaming experience because well at this point people are pretty much giving these TVs away this 50-inch TV basically just cost me A Fistful of pocket lint and a couple of Cheerios now in all fairness this is about a 12 year old TV and uh plasma is known to have a problem with burning so yeah that's maybe why they didn't hold their value so well and I did buy this from a museum so I think this is a reasonable chance this TV's just spent the last 12 years displaying a static image which means it would be completely unusable but let's plug it in and see oh many clicking sounds okay so there's not just like a burnt in shot of a T-rex skull or something in the image so that's a good start now the first problem that I've immediately noticed is that even when the TV is off it the background is gray basically so I don't think we're gonna have particularly good black levels on this TV okay this is very exciting look at that start update I mean straight off the bat there's a real like haze around stuff and after observing the slight haze around text I decided to give the display another quick wipe down with cleaning liquor while I waited for the Xbox to finish updating and once everything was finally ready I immediately noticed a bit of a problem with this TV wow is that full brightness it's really annoying it didn't come with a remote and wow it is so slow navigating the OSD on this TV feels like swimming through custard while trying clumsily to pleasure a robot and when I finally got to the brightness settings it didn't do much I think I'm gonna have to turn that light down quite a bit a few moments later okay so I've actually had the more light in just so that we can properly see what's going on on the TV so clearly brightness is an immediate shortcoming of plasma TVs uh but it's nice and dark in here now let's start with the good things um if you look at the horse's butt that's some pretty crazy black levels right there I mean if you get close to it you start to see like a like a noise artifact but that is some deep black levels right there now aside from the occasional hints at very good black levels the image is very flat and gray looking I remember Elder ring being quite a gray game but definitely not this gray now the muted colors look quite pleasing it's not as bright and vibrant as a modern TV but it's got a bit of a film camera effect to it just a quick note from editor David here that kind of yellowy Trail you see behind moving objects on screen that only seems to show up in video of the TV I didn't notice it in person although what I did notice in person was that the image had quite a bit of a flicker to it there is a bit of a like a flickering I don't know if you can tell that over camera but there's a definite flickering which is a bit annoying but with that let's try a more vibrant game so that we can see how muted it really is the 1080p is really not sharp I I remember how people would say like oh you can't really see the difference between 1080P and 4K unless it's on like a huge TV and you're sitting right next to it like I'm sitting a reasonable distance away from it and it's really not very sharp interestingly High pixel densities were a real problem for plasma TVs and even something like 1080p at 42 inch was very difficult to make so in terms of resolution war plasma didn't stand a chance anyway with that side note out of the way let's get back to the flat image now I've switched over to Ori which is a very colorful game and this the contrast on this TV is all over the place in some scenes this really deep blacks but in other scenes it's just like a flat gray image and I think the reason for that maybe that This TV has a similar problem that oleds have just on a much worse scale in that it can't really produce dark gray because plasma TVs are also a self-immissive display technology so they don't have a backlight the actual pixel itself produces the light which means for very dark scenes the pixel condemn itself a lot giving you deep blacks but the moment a little bit of extra charge gets given to that pixel I think it immediately turns like a light gray so that's why when there isn't like a very dark bit in the image it looks like there's basically no contrast although despite that the colors have a real richness to them even though there's not much contrast there it's quite weird but seeing this TV makes me really want to experience like a very high-end plasma TV because I think they'd have a really beautiful image although I do think this TV is going to measure horrendously because its white levels are also all over the place but I'll measure it a bit later in the video first let's plug a gaming PC into this TV so that we can play some FPS games and get a better sense of the motion rendering and input lag on this plasma TV wow on the desktop you can really see how much this TV struggles to reproduce white there's this like brown Haze over the image so the input lag there is a little bit that you can feel like it's maybe not quite modern gaming monitor fast but for a TV it feels surprisingly good like going into this I was expecting this TV to be unusable for this kind of gaming but it's so much better than I was expecting and you can comfortably play a game like Battlefield 5 and not have the input lag bothering you also in terms of motion rendering this may be one of the better 60 hertz signals I've ever seen like it's surprisingly good actually I want to go try some CS go yo oh I got him what a shot the gaming experience may be surprisingly good on this TV but the flicker does kind of bother me and again I'm I'm pretty sure it's gonna measure real badly so let's actually let's actually do a quick measurement and see how it holds up using my spider X to measure the image quality of this TV LED to some very interesting results wow that is easily one of the worst color accuracy results I've ever seen and I tried a bunch of different color profiles and this was actually the best one of all of them that is real bad also the gamma measurement is pretty crazy look at that hump and then there's also the fact that the brightness settings don't really seem to do anything and that is clearly not a TV for a bright room also look at that contrast damn so in conclusion this plasma TV definitely wasn't a very good example of one but still I was very surprised at how good its strengths are as a technology and I paid the equivalent of about 69 nice US dollars for this TV so they may have some real shortcomings but you can't really deny the value actually considering their strengths and weaknesses these are kind of like a poor man's OLED which I think is really cool and I would still really like to see Peak plasma television because I think that may be something pretty special anyway with that it brings me to the end of the video let me know in the comment section down below if you're still using a plasma TV at home and if so why you've decided to hold on to it and uh yeah thank you for watching until the next video bye thank you",

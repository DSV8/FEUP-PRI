    "transcript": "It's a two for one today! Got two packages! It's the latest and greatest from Turtle Beach. They reached out and said, \"Lou, we want you to show the world what we've been working on.\" I said, \"I'm your guy.\" We wanna DO IT ON UNBOX THERAPY! LET'S DO IT LIVE! A brand new gaming headset, the Stealth 350 VR. It's a gaming headset which is targeted at VR (Virtual Reality) users It's got a microphone attachment as well, of course... Talking back, like any other headset, but it's got a VR design. The over-ear design and memory foam have a grooved headband which is tailor built for VR comfort. So that means it goes along with your VR headset and you do need a decent headset for a fully immersive VR experience. 50 millimeter speakers, its important for, as they call it, THUNDERING LOWS! An integrated amp, which works for 30 hours via the rechargeable amplifier. Ok, cool. Now this thing will work with PlayStation VR, PS 4, Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and even mobile VR. You can see a picture on the side here with the extra clearance for the VR headset. Now, also, they got this stream mic over here. Now, I know a lot of you out there, you wanna kick off your own YouTube channel. Maybe you wanna stream on Twitch and you need a microphone to get started. Trust me. Do not underestimate audio. People want to hear you! Clearly, loud and clear, you know what I mean? That little chinsy mic. Maybe you got it hanging down from the earbud. You know the one with the little button o- NO! That's not how you get it started. No one's going to respect you or watch you. Your streams are going to have, what, six, six people watching and you're related to all of them? It's sad. This is cool. So they are the official partner of Twitch. I didn't know that. This stream mic is for console and PC streaming. And then on the back, it has universal compatibility, so Xbox, PS4, PC. It's got adaptive mic patterns with TrueSpeed technology. Professional processing for EQ, GAIN, compression, and others. It's got a built-in headphone amp, so you could speak into this and then amplify your headphones for monitoring coming out of there. Personalized voice tuning, so you can personalize the sound of your voice. *In a sing-song voice* Where's my knife? First, let's check out the mic because I just finished talking about it. Oooh. \"This is Turtle Beach. The pursuit of perfection drives us.\" Oh my goodness. \"Ready to make everyone sound like a pro, even you.\" You're the next PewDiePie out there, could be... Oooh, I kinda like the styling on that. *protective wrap being teared off* Ooh. Fresh. It's kind of got an old-school-looking vibe to it. Those old-timey microphones, like you're Elvis. She ain't nothing but a hound dog [intelligible] all the time What's she doing all the time? What do we have here? Must be a nice little base for it. Yes, of course. A large USB cable here. This is cool. It's a heavy duty base. So when that baby's on the desk, you are golden, even when you get rowdy. This is an adapter for a boom or mic stand. That goes there like that. A large, dedicated mic can make a huge difference to your streams or your videos. There's also a nice big mute button on the front. Right here. Your mom's screaming at you because you... You're streaming too long and you're not doing your homework. So you got the mute button. Keep it private. This is where all your options exist. So, you can connect your headset right here. You've also got dedicated volume, so this essentially becomes your audio interface. So PS4 and PC are on the same setting? And Xbox ... has its own independent setting. And then on the far side, you got your USB port for connecting to whichever system you're using. Let's jump inside the Stealth 350 VR headset. Ooooh! Nice and light. So you can see the cutout at the top here. Adjustable... *sliders sliding back and forth* *protective wrap being torn off* So, some controls on the earcup. There's power as well as a microphone mute. It's in that location there. Micro-USB to charge it up. *More protective wrap being torn off* Really smooth material on the inside of the earcuff. Plus, they fold completely flat. That's a nice touch. Here is your microphone. MIDI jack cable with a right-angle connector. An audio cable for your audio interface. Micro USB cable. Oh! That's a bass boost. Tailor your sound. Get a little more thump if you want it and turn that down, back that down if you don't. Oooooohhh ... Oooohh ... Those fit in there absolutely perfectly. Even with my glasses on. You see how that fits right in there? I mean, man, I love on a next-gen console it just goes right into the controller. So convenient. *Randomly pressing buttons, jerking controller around as if he's punching* Taking care of dudes. I'm just gonna sample it with a little bit of music first... Huge ability to tune this sound with this bass control. You want the thump, man, you can go after it and get it. More bass, please. *Forcefully pats arm* \"Saving Private Ryan - Omaha Beach\". How's that for sound effects? PEEEEWWWW!!!!!! PEEEEEWWW!!!!! GRRRRRRATATATTATATATTATATTA!!!!! PEEWW!! PEEEWW!! So, there it is. Two new products form Turtle Beach. The Stealth 350 VR ... VR-specific headset. So can get immersed and stay immersed. Be on your couch for weeks at a time. Then we got the stream mic. So you can start your broadcast career, become a famous YouTuber. The rest is history. Be like me. Be like Jack.",

    "transcript": "(upbeat music) - Hey, what's up, MKBHD here. And we finally have them, two of maybe the most hyped devices of the entire year in their real retail boxes, the Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6 Pro. And right off the bat, you can see these new, smaller boxes, which you already know what that means, but let's just get started with the Pixel 6 here, the smaller one. So we've got these little plastic tabs on the sides of this recycled cardboard box. You get past those, flip it over, and right up at the top, there you have it. This is the Kinda Coral Pixel 6, looking exactly how we've seen it in all these materials and on websites and in teasers for the past six months or however long it's been, this is it. Flat display up front, camera visor on the back, with two different tones, two different color oranges on this design, but with the rest of the box, as you can see, if we get into that, you get a USB type C cable and you have a USB A adapter along with some paperwork, and there is a sim card removal tool over here also. But yeah, as you can tell, there is no charging brick in the box, but now we know. This phone will start at 599 for 128 Gigs. Now I've got a lot of thoughts on this, but hang on to that for a quick second, let's take a look at also the slightly larger phone in the slightly larger box. Again, with tabs on the back, and I kind of like this. We're not really needing to use a knife as often anymore with unboxings, but then again, up top here, we have the Stormy Black Pixel 6 Pro looking like an evolved Nexus 6P, for those of you who remember that phone, shout out to you. And if you look closely, you can also see, it is actually, technically, also dual tone, the top gray is a little bit lighter than the bottom gray, but this phone, this phone will also start at 128 Gigs of storage and it's at 899. So 599 and 899 for these two phones. My reaction when I first saw these prices was like, \"Oh wow, that's a lot better than I expected.\" A 599 for the Pixel 6, that just feels like a really good deal. That was just my gut, but then my second thought was, \"Okay, now there is $300 in difference in price between these two phones. And there's not a whole ton of difference between them, physically.\" It kind of makes the 6 Pro seem like maybe a little bit of a tough sell, but anyway, for this video, I'm not allowed to share any new software features or any sample photos yet, or really anything conclusive yet until my full review, which is pretty annoying, and quite frankly, a bit of a red flag, but for this video, what I can show you, for those considering pre-ordering, is everything that is now real about these phones and confirmed and all the differences between them and my reactions to that. So these phones both have similar specs, both have the new Tensor Chip we've talked so much about and the new Titan M2 security chip, they both start at 128 Gigs of storage, although the 6 Pro can go up to half a Terabyte while the smaller 6 goes up to 256 and the 6 Pro does have more ram. It has 12 Gigs of ram, while there's eight Gigs in the smaller phone, but really the biggest difference between them is the size and that screen on the front. And it's not even that huge of a difference. They're both pretty huge, but you can see here, Pixel 6 has a 6.4 inch flat, 90 hertz, 1080P OLED display, like I said, already a pretty big screen, but then the 6 Pro has a 6.7 inch, 120 Hertz, 1440P LTPO display that's slightly curved around the edges. So this one can modulate up and down from as little as 10 hertz all the way up to 120. That's the benefit of that LTPO technology. And it also has a slightly smaller chin and some smaller side bezels, too. Some people may prefer this. It does look a bit more premium. Either way, these are the biggest Pixels ever, and they do now much more resemble the higher end phones out there. You know, they've got the whole punch camera up top for the selfies and the fingerprint reader underneath the glass on the lower third, but then a slightly bigger phone also does mean slightly more room on the inside to take advantage of, which means the bigger one does have more room inside for a bigger battery, 4600 million powers on the Pixel 6, 5,000 million powers on the 6 Pro, so those are both pretty good numbers on paper and the bigger one also does get an extra camera inside. So in this camera visor, that's what I'm calling it, they share this new 50 megapixel larger primary camera and the same ultra-wide, but the 6 Pro also has a folded 4x optical zoom lens for those telephoto shots. I am very interested in testing this whole new camera system now that they've finally, finally, upgraded so much of this hardware and there's some big promises made about both photos and videos that could be really cool, but again, not allowed to show that yet so we'll just have to wait and see, definitely get subscribed so you do see that early. But also the last little thing, the difference is just the rails on the side of the phone. On the Pixel 6, it's matte black and they're made of aluminum, while the Pixel 6 Pro has a slightly heavier, technically, more durable glossy stainless steel. It is pretty dark stainless steel though, not like the lighter colors on the Pro iPhones that show a lot of fingerprints, but all that being said, I honestly think I prefer the look and feel of the Pixel 6 overall. And that's as someone who doesn't plan on putting a case on this phone. You know, usually, there's a difference between seeing a render of a phone, like an image on some website on a screen or something, and then actually getting out the box and holding it and looking at it. And usually, I like it more once I hold it in real life. And this is another one of those designs that looks kind of strange, at least very unique, on paper or on your screen, and then once you start using it, pretty quickly, you get used to it. But I think their goal with this phone is to look unique, like to not look like any other phone. We've all seen the rounded camera bump in the corner of the phone. And if their goal was to stand out and not do that, and really establish like a Pixel design, I think they've done that. And the funny thing is, once you start using a phone with this like full width visor, is what I'm calling it, it actually, first of all, acts as a place to rest your finger if you hold the phone like this, the way I do. And also it won't rock nearly as much, actually, it won't rock at all back and forth on a table, so that's a nice bonus. But I will say it has also already started gathering dust in the very corners at this 90 degree angle. And that's gonna be incredibly annoying and difficult to clean, no doubt. The buttons on the side of this phone, very clicky. They're in the opposite order though than pretty much every other phone that puts the power and volume on the same side. I'll probably get used to this though, but there's also actually a little indentation, if you can see it here, a little notch in between the power and volume buttons, and that actually makes the buttons feel like they travel more, you can feel the depth of the button a bit more as you're clicking them. And this indent is nowhere else on the phone, so it's pretty neat touch. And the 6 Pro also interrupts the stainless steel rails at the top for a matte black cutout, which I believe should be for the millimeterwave 5G antennas that the smaller Pixel 6 does not have. You know what I do miss though, the Pixels used to always do those accent-colored power buttons. This one's just black on black. I like those accent power buttons, RIP. But yeah, that about covers it as far as differences between these two phones, as of right now. Of course, make sure you get subscribed to see the full review when that does come out of these, but essentially, what you're looking at is more screen, more battery, more camera, and more ram on the bigger phone. But yeah, from that, pretty much everything else is the same as far as specs, which kind of makes the Pixel 6 look like a much better deal. You know, they have the same chip inside, the Tensor Chip, of course. They both have 30-watt wired charging. They both have wireless charging. They share the same primary and ultra wide camera like the very same, oh, I almost forgot. The ultra wide selfie camera is back. That's pretty sweet. I was missing that in the previous Pixel. Happy it's back. But yeah, you know, they both have Android 12, a lot of the same features. It's just gonna be a matter of like, do you want a little bit of that extra for the 6 Pro? Oh, and of course, they're both promised five years of security updates, which is awesome for an Android phone. Good looks for the Pixel. But yeah, I'm gonna be off to testing these phones, Android 12, material, all of the new software features, and the things that make a Pixel a Pixel, which I'm really excited about, but let me know what you want to see in the full review. Let me know in the comments below. Either way, that's been it. Moving right along. It's the Techtober, there's more coming. Catch you on the next one. Peace. (futuristic electrical buzzing)",

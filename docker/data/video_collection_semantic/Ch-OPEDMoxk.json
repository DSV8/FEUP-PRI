    "description": "Intel's Optane technology hasn't exactly made any fans around here but that was mostly due to its overall cost versus performance benefits but the new H10 does things differently.  Intel jammed an Optane accelerator along with up to a 1TB SSD onto a single M.2 module.  Let's take a look at this weird mashup before our performance testing.

    "transcript": "hello good people on Dmitry and today let's talk about a really exciting topic Intel Optane memory now to be honest with our previous experience with Intel Optane it wasn't so exciting for the DIY community now on paper it's supposed to cache data from the most used programs and use that information to accelerate applications and when those loading times when paired with a standard hard drive and that's exactly what happened however there were too many limitations with Intel Optane so it didn't really add any value over traditional SSDs they were expensive modules if you were adding it to an existing machine with a hard drive you most likely had to do a complete revamp and reinstall windows and it could only accelerate the hard drive onto which the OS was installed however I would say it deemed pretty successful for the notebook space and so now Intel is launching a completely new module that could point towards them really interesting evolution for the SSD market let's talk about that right this give you a hardware the power deserves would be quiet straight power 11 power supply with a wire free internal design fantastic cooling with silent wings three fan and a fully modular layout with black cables and 80 plus gold efficiency check them out below alright so in order to understand where the h10 module fits in let's talk about the current lineup of Intel Optane because it is a bit confusing first of all anything with Optane memory name means that it uses 3d xpoint storage to boost system responsiveness through data caching rather than being a standalone SSD and that's where the Optane memory m10 comes in it's targeted towards entry-level systems with spinning hard drives now the drives without the memory designation are full-blown SSDs in the mainstream market there's the 800P series that's only offered and really odd 118 and 58 gigabyte capacities and finally there's the opting 900P and 905P which use higher capacity 3d xpoint modules and cost an absolute fortune so those are pretty much reserved only for enthusiasts with pretty deep pockets and so the Optane memory h10 fills the spot between entry-level and mainstream and it will not be sold separately because intel sees that is like a value add towards the notebook space instead and so this is the H10 module it may look like any other m.2 SSD but it she takes a very different approach so on the one side there's the 16 or 32 gigabytes of obtain memory that can provide latency measured in microseconds rather than milliseconds like in most others as these and the other part of this drive is actually a dedicated SSD with up to one terabyte of qc3 dean and now in the past Optane did not have enough performance to properly accelerate SSDs but with technological improvements we can now take this SSD section and accelerate with octane by supposedly a pretty big amount and this communicates with the system via the x4 and vme interface which reserves two lanes for the NAND and the other two for opt-in caching and with Intel Smart Response driver working in the background to cache your most-used files and dynamically accelerate them this is all supposed to happen without any interaction from the user and so having a single module with opted in memory on it and the SSD that it's accelerating is exciting because you're basically miniaturizing your primary storage and the Optane memory acceleration and this whole space-saving approach could lead to more connectivity on notebooks card readers are disappearing way too fast it could open up secondary storage compartments in a notebook that the user or the noble manufacturer could also populate so that the Intel update memory module itself is not occupying the m dot to stall on the motherboard but that slot now is occupied by your primary storage and the opting itself and right now these Optane modules would only be available to notebook manufacturers and they'll be available in three capacities the sixteen gigabytes that will provide caching for 256 gigabytes onboard SSD I expect to see that one is slightly lower end systems and the other two are a lot more interesting since they provide 32 gigabytes worth of space for acceleration along with 512 and one terabyte of SSD storage that is a huge amount of accelerated storage for notebooks that normally get less now in terms of performance the h10 equipped optane memory machine is on its way to michael and eber so stay tuned for all our performance results there but until then Intel has provided some interesting charts so you see here even though most synthetic benchmarks are on the entire range of queue depth most programs actually spend their loading times between one and two and that's where Optane memory provides most of its performance meanwhile it does struggle to compete in benchmarks that put continual stress on this storage system again here looks like intel is targeting a more typical scenario for application loads rather than someone who requires a ton of continuous storage performance and that's pretty important since it shows the h10 might not be a benchmark monster but it provides performance where people need it most and so I would love to hear what you think about this whole evolution of Intel Optane memory you know in our previous experience it was nothing special sure it accelerated by a few seconds but it was really not user-friendly so I'm excited to see you know how h10 module performs Michael and Eber will be doing their testing and see if it's a bit more user friendly and if it actually makes sense for you look thin in like notebooks that most likely coming out in June I guess the biggest concern for me right now the price and if adding these new h10 update memory modules into notebooks will just increase the cost of them but hopefully not too much because the primary hard drive is already kind of built in on the same module that is being accelerated so I guess we'll have to wait and see now the thing that I'm most excited about with these modules is the whole system responsiveness especially on a notebook space like everything will just completely fly you know opening premiere this is not gonna show me the loading bar it just like open up or opening audition or Lightroom know those things that thing kind of forever even on the fastest SD will just fly and especially because we're already talking about they're really fast and DME SSD and adding opting on top of that to just like bring us to that next level of performance but stay tuned for our full performance analysis coming later thanks so much for watching I'm Dimitri we'll see you the next video",

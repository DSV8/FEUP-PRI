    "transcript": "What's up guys, Lou here back with another video, And today it's a comparison, a versus video if you will, And possibly a bit of a guide for what you should be looking for in your upcoming smartphone. If you're hoping to spend somewhere between $300 and $400. In front of me I have two devices that are representations of that. I have the OnePlus 2, newly released, hotly anticipated. And I've also got the Moto X Play, which some of you might not have heard of yet. It might actually be called something else in the US as a Verizon exclusive. Here in Canada it's the Moto X Play. It's more about meshing two phones together that base models will retail somewhere around $300. We know that the OnePlus 2 starts at $329, And I'm thinking that the Moto X Play will be around the same. These things are right in each other's... wheelhouse. They are, they're doing this right now. Speckwise, not so much. This is where things get interesting. As much as they're both great choices in this price range, They're great choices for different reasons, So let's go ahead and get into those reasons. Starting with the OnePlus 2. This is the 64 gigabyte sandstone version. I've got the cool, dbrand skin upon here, carbon fiber 2 tone. If you wanna customize your OnePlus, you wanna do it in an inexpensive fashion. You should check out dbrand there, link will be down in the description. A cool looking charge brick, look at that. Red, white, A nice little cable as well. But this actually brings me to one of my first points. This one features USB C, while the X Play doesn't. Now, you might not think that is a major advantage because right now, there aren't many things that utilize USB C, And you'd be right. I think this depends on the individual, Whether you see this as an advantage or a disadvantage. But, since this is a channel with... a heavy focus on technology, I'll give some props to OnePlus for being on the cutting edge with that brand new interface, And as things become more wildly available that take advantage of it, You'll be ready for that future. Moving on to the second feature that the OnePlus 2 has that the Moto X doesn't is a dual SIM card slot, So you can carry around two different networks with you. So next up we have the guts of the device, And this is where OnePlus takes a step ahead. You've got a faster processor here as well as more RAM, You can get 3 gigabytes or 4 gigabytes of RAM depending on which configuration you go with. Next, let's talk about the camera. While the OnePlus 2 has a 13 megapixel sensor, Unlike the Moto X, it's capable of shooting 4K video and it's also got optical image stabilization on the rear camera. So if you're a video shooter, you're probably gonna wanna look at this device, as it has those extra capabilities. Fingerprint sensor. This one has one, And the Moto X does not. If security is a big thing for you or you like the convenience of unlocking your device with your finger, You can't do that on the Motorola. You can do it on the OnePlus 2. Lastly, exclusiveness. You have to get an invite, 'cause all these cryptic ways of... securing a OnePlus 2 for yourself. But for those who actually get one there is, sort of a point of pride of like, \"Yeah, that's my OnePlus 2. Oh you don't know what it is? That's cool, just me and my OnePlus 2.\" You know, you walk around like it's some kind of achievement that you even got one, Let alone an invite, I mean on Twitter, there are giveaways for invites. There are giveaways for the opportunity to buy something. Think about that real quick. So, the scarcity or at least the perception of scarcity here, Is a sort of exclusive vibe when you have this phone. I'm gonna call it an advantage, but on the other side when I get to the Motorola, I'm gonna turn it into a disadvantage. Let's get that part started. Okay, so here is the Moto X Play. If you're unfamilliar with what Motorola has been doing recently with their devices, They've been emphasizing a sort of pure Android experience. The unadulterted version of Android and I'm a fan of that. Now, as mentioned before, you're looking at slightly less horsepower here in the X Play. But, how about, a bigger battery. This one features a 3630 mAh battery. How about quick charge, like 50% of your charge in half an hour or whatever it is. Now, while this model only ships with 16 gigabytes of storage, It has expandability. Got a Micro SD Slot so you can go ahead and stick a 128 gigabyte card in there. A little bit more durable. At least from a water resistant standpoint, this can take a splash or two. You don't wanna dunk it like the Moto G, don't go dunkin'. Other items included in the box, a USB cable, as well as a power brick and a SIM card tool. No fancy USB C, now this one's a tough one to evaluate. This can be an advantage or a disadvantage depending on where you stand. It's said that Motorola has made major improvements to the camera here on the X. You now have a 21 megapixel sensor, Which is apparently going to be far more capable than the previous version. And this to me is an advantage, granted, camera's attributes are not all about resolution and that's it, And it's not all about megapixels. We all know that by this point in time. There's a low light sensitivity, sensor size, You've got more resolution out of this camera than the OnePlus 2. NFC. Or, the lack thereof on the OnePlus 2 for whatever reason, it doesn't ship with NFC. It could be a deal breaker. You got NFC over here. While you're gazing at the screen here of the Motorola, There's something you're gonna notice. It's not the forward-facing camera that's on every single phone, No, it is the speakers. Oh, my goodness, front-facing speakers? \"Lou, are you serious? There's something that we can come to expect here in 2015?\" Well, in some cases, yes it's actually kind of amazing that more phones don't feature forward-facing speakers. As you'd imagine if you use your phone as your primary device, your primary computing device. Or even not as your primary maybe it's just a consumption device for you, while you're lying down on your couch or something. There's certainly an argument to be made that the multimedia experience is far better with forward facing sound, Theoretically, it should be clearer, it should be nicer, easier to deal with, you won't cover up the ports. Okay, so that brings me to my very last point. With the OnePlus 2 there's an exclusivity and air of exclusivity about it. Granted this device is currently not available everywhere but once it is, it will be the kind of thing where you walk into a store, And you hand them money, and they hand you a phone back. It's gonna work like any other smartphone. You can just buy it so long as there's inventory available. So there you have it. OnePlus 2, Moto X Play, I hope this helps you guys make a better decision when trying to figure out what phone to get next. Those were the things that popped out to me when I was looking at the differences, And it's actually kind of surprising that 2 phones, in a very similar price point, actually have significantly different attributes, And reasons why you would want one over the other. If you wanna check out the pricing and availability, I'll drop links to these two devices down in the description. Thank you very much for watching. If you enjoyed this content, make sure to leave a thumbs up down below, And I'll catch you on the next episode. Later guys. [Outtakes] (Singing) Lew, can you invite me to, purchase OnePlus Two... Jack?: You're wasting valuable no-noise time. Lew(Singing again): Lew, can you please invite me, I love the OnePlus Two... *Laughter* (\"Eh\" noises) Eh.",

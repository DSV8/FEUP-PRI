    "transcript": "- Hello, and welcome to This Is. Did you know that the MacBook is just an aluminum piece of garbage? - I'm really excited about MacBooks. In the trash with you. Today, we're taking a look at laptops that didn't kill the MacBook but probably should have. Starting out with number one. - The Dell XPS 15. The Dell XPS is a damn good laptop. So if you've seen these videos before what we're gonna do is we are gonna be taking a look at some of these laptops. We are gonna argue that why they are better than the MacBook Pro, which won't be hard because all of them are in fact better than the MacBook Pro. - Fact. - The only catch is that we don't know what we're arguing ahead of time. I'll be honest. I was like, kind of expecting this to be trash. - Like what? It's an actual real laptop to start. - Yeah, it's like really good. It's got like 11th gen Intel processor. It's got super thin bezels. It's got a 3050 in it. There's nothing ironic. This is like a really good laptop. - I think it's bad actually. My argument is that MacBooks are good and the XPS is bad. My argument is for the truly greatest laptop that we've ever seen. The Chuwi AeroBook pro. Now. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, did I get the good one, and Austin get the bad one? - For $500 this device brings some of the most impressive design you've ever seen. Now, did they have to Photoshop some of the photos to make a look a little bit better? Yeah, but of course, whoever posts like a regular photo to Instagram? What's to stop Chuwi from doing the same thing? This is so pro it has pro in the name, a key component of any device, which is for professionals. On top of that, it has some similar MacBook build quality. I would argue probably better. And it has one of the most high performing impressive processes you could have, a Core m3, which is enough to run at least a tab of Facebook and maybe even a YouTube video, if you try really, really hard. - This thing had to Photoshop itself to look thinner. If I don't have to do that, then the Chuwi doesn't have to do that. But you know what doesn't also have to Photoshop itself? The Razer Book 13, today is coming up Matt. Now, this is a non gaming version of the Razer. So this is more of a productivity laptop. You can play some minor games on here, but again this thing is a productivity beast. It's got all the ports you can want. It's got thunderbolt, it's got USB A. It's still got all the fun little bits and boobs like per-key RGB. This is a great little laptop. If you're a gamer, maybe not the one for you, but it definitely beats a MacBook. - The Razer Book, I will give you, has some redeeming qualities. However, I'm just gonna say it holds no candles whatsoever compared to the Alienware M17x. Yes, friends, the OG, the big chongus. This is the first laptop that Alienware made after being acquired by Dell. It was all about trying to show everyone that you were a real gamer. Now this is mind you just nine, before RGB was all the rage right? Alienware... - No, you just had G. This behemoth had not one, but two G4s 9800s in it. - [Austin] SLI, baby. - Did this one need two power adapters as well? That were roughly the same weight as any of the laptops I've looked at so far. - No, but Matt, what you're missing the point of is that this is cool and your (expletive) sucks. Laptops these days are thin and all about their aesthetic and, who cares? - I don't want a forklift to have to carry around my laptop. (inaudible) - Forklift for other things, Matt. - You know what is better? - Like your ego. - My ego is way bigger than a forklift. You guys don't know you're in the presence of a CFO. A Certified Forklift Operator. Show me the next one. (Laughing) - Okay. - Where's that forklift? Beep, beep, beep. (laughing) - My hubris flew a little too close to the sun and I got shot in the face for 4,999. It had an over-clockable desktop GTX 980, an over-clockable I7 processor. But the way, way, way, way, way, way, way, cool thing was a detachable dock that liquid cooled all of this. - I actually remember this. It would actually work without the dock. - Yes. - But when you plug the dock in, it would literally just liquid cool everything and help you to run at sort of the proper specs. Because it's easy to forget, like these days you hear a lot of like desktop class, this and that, but this is actually true desktop class gear in a laptop. And it was about the size of a desktop. How could you say this is better than a MacBook, Matt? It weighed a mere eight pounds. 18 with the dock. - I might be arguing against MacBooks today, I'm gonna say the MacBook was better than this. This is a cool clickbait Linus video for 2016. - Didn't know you were an Apple shill. - Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! - Let me see you try and argue this piece of garbage. - [Austin] The Framework laptop. - [Matt] Dammit. - [Austin] Speaking of lap... - [Matt] I'm doing the show. - Freaking loves this thing. Of course, if you've ever watched Linus Tech Tips video is invested in by the one and only Linus Sebastian. Really? That's all I need to say. I can explain to you why it's a modular, affordable, fixable, and eco-friendly laptop, but who cares about any of that? The only thing that anyone cares about is that Linus likes it and by buying one of these, you're depositing 17 cents into Linus' personal bank account. Honestly, when I buy a laptop, the only thing I look for is does this personally benefit Linus Sebastian? Cause if it doesn't I'm out. - Do you remember that video we did a while back that is I built a laptop? - Yeah, it was really bad. (inaudible) - That Kano? We keep getting comments on that video. And this is from before the Framework was out by the way. And they're like, why didn't you mention the Framework? - Are you trying to tell me that YouTube comments from years old videos are sometimes not up to date almost up... - Sometimes not up to date, but you know what I love strictly because of YouTube commentators? (laughing). I'm sorry, what? (laughing) Kenzie, (expletive) you. (laughing) - Released in 2002, this 5,012 pound brainchild of the mad lab. Who the (expletive) is Jeff Patillo? - I think he's getting so tilted right now. It's the Xentex Flip-Pad Voyager, Matt. - It folds into fours! Who looked at a laptop and said, \"I need more folds in this fourth?\" Unsurprisingly, it never made it to the stores. But according to Petillo, this was because his manufacturing partner went bankrupt. - This is absolutely ridiculous. And Kenzie, thank you very much for giving this one to Matt, because I'm happy that while you have to argue that this pile of (expletive) is better than the MacBook. I get to argue that in fact, the superior device to all of these laptops and the MacBook is... (laughing) - Kenzie why are you laughing? You haven't even flipped it. The Dragonfly Futurefon. Mad lab Jeff Petillo back again, baby. He took your money once, he'll take it again. The Dragonfly Futurefon was a 2014 project. That was a phone, a computer and an Indy Gogo scam. - I just wanna know what's going on with Petillo. Why was he so obsessed with that one feature? - The left side can be Windows. The right side can be Android, or you can run Windows on both displays. This raised $726,000 on Indy Gogo. And then he got convicted for 12 counts of fraud. - This is as much of a scam as those garbage MacBook Pros. But you know what's not a scam? - What is that? - The next one. Yes! Finally a good one. The IBM ThinkPad 701. This was a compact laptop that had the revolutionary butterfly keyboard. Not the BS one that Apple says with my butterfly keys which would get a speck of dust in there and break forever. No, this bad boy would actually fold out and expand past the bezels to have a full size keyboard experience with a small package. This won 27 design awards including into the MoMA Museum of Modern Art. - I will say this actually looks phenomenal. Like this is what almost 30 years old at this point. It still looks great today. I'm not gonna argue this one. I'm actually gonna agree with you rarely. - It's one of the best laptops ever made. - It's super cool. It's super cool. Mind you laptops in 1995 did kind of suck, but this one sucked the least and certainly has one of the most unique designs. You know, Matt, what I could never say sucks? Something that would be truly incredible. The Via Nano Book. Okay. So there were a series of laptops in the late 2000s called Netbooks. They were wildly popular. I wanted one. I couldn't afford one. But they were super cool because they were tiny little laptops. They were very affordable, very, very portable. Little weak, and usually ran Windows XP, but they were super, super cool. Well, the Via Nano Book took this to another level. 2007 it cost $600. It is a tiny ultra portable that weighed less than two pounds. It had a included voice over IP phone on the side, optional GPS. This was the do-everything device. You got your Windows XP on the left. You got your IP phone on the right. You got the world's tiniest keyboard on the bottom. The Windows XP desktop has never looked better. Just look really, like squint a little bit kind of... - That 12 pixels of screen real estate there was really great. You know what had much better resolution? The ASUS ZenBook Pro Duo 15. This had so much resolution, it couldn't even fit it on a single screen. Packed with an RTX 3070 and an I9, this Screen Pad Plus is the answer to MacBook's failed touch bar. The only complaint I had about this one was the awkward track pad over to the side. - And they've actually done more of these. So this is specifically the Pro Duo 15, and they've gotten better. Like they've improved the displays over time. I'm sorry, Matt. I love this thing so much. I gotta argue on your behalf here. - So do I get 40 points? - No more points, Matt. There's no points for this. You know what, I won't argue on your behalf though. The Lenovo Think Pad 2700 DS. - Before we get into this, Kenzie, did you just search for laptops that have multiple screens? - No. - Did you just find a Buzzfeed article of laptops that have multiple screens? - No, they're just cool. - There you go. They're just cool. Like the think pad. So this is from a 2009 vintage. A particularly fine vintage, I might add, since that's when I started making videos. This is a $3,000 laptop that would go up to about five gram when you specked it out. Expensive, right? However, when you spend that kind of money you expect a high quality performance. And that's what you got here because the DS stood for dual screens. - Is that what DS stood for? I'm just putting two and two together to equal six on that one. - This did actually have a cool feature which added a Pantone color calibration sensor. Much like some of the later Think Pads, you wanna make sure that your color accurate drawing on your Think Pad DS is high quality. - You know what would've top that, if it had the fold out butterfly keyboard. But, I can top this one because up next we have literally one of my favorite laptops of all time. - Wait, really? - This is an accurate, this is real. - Really? - I love the Surface Laptop Go. This guy is the most premium feeling device I've ever used. It's not the best specs in the world. It's not the cheapest laptop in the world. It's not even the best price for the specs that are having there. - You really selling me here. - It starts at $550. The track pad was on par with Apple, with the MacBooks, which I think is the best track pad. The keyboard was wonderful. - [Austin] Yeah. - It had a 3:2 aspect ratio, which was, I thought, perfect for productivity. No, it didn't have an integrated GPU. So gaming on this thing was a chore. - We did it, this is on the service laptop, didn't we? - We did, and that's when I started playing it. I really like this thing. - I actually agree with you. This is actually really cool. The main thing I think they messed up here though was just the pricing. To get a configuration that you would actually wanna use regularly, it jumps up to like 900 bucks. And at that point you're starting to get into like XPS 13 territory it's a little bit of a hard sell. - This was the equivalent of the MacBook 12 inch. - Yeah, you had (inaudible) - It had extra port instead of just one, like the garbage MacBook 12 inch. - Well, you know, what's better than both the Surface Laptop Go and the garbage Macbook 12 inch. the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Fold. Guess you don't need in a laptop? A keyboard, what's up? 'Cause this, my friends, is a Windows powered, folding laptop tablet. It folds in half. - Think we just call those two in ones. - Nope. It also has a beautiful OLED display, which is why it's foldable. Right? So this is basically a giant Galaxy Z Flip that you just fold open. The fold, I think even today, even though it spent a couple years, still looks super cool. And I know for a fact that other companies are working on similar form factors and similar devices that I may or may not be checking out shortly. - And it comes with a stylus that you immediately scratched your screen with because it has to be soft. - I didn't do that. - But you know what doesn't have a soft screen? The Toshiba AC100 hundred. So this was in 2010, it ran Android 2.1 - Particularly excellent version of Android. - Yeah. This is like a precursor to Chromebooks. And look at what it spawned. - This didn't spawn anything. - It spawned. - Everything spawned itself. - We're gonna have gaming Chromebooks because of this guy. - No, no this happened and this flighted the industry for a solid five minutes. - This is a trendsetter. - This didn't even run flash. - And neither does MacBooks now. Trendsetter? I think so. - (expletive) you Matt. - After tallying up the scores, it's clear that I have won 57 to two. I'll give you the one. let us know in the comments who is right, who is wrong which laptops do you think we should look at which are better than the MacBooks. We'll catch you in the next one, when I beat Austin again. - Here's the laptop back. - Can I have my laptop back? I need to work today.",

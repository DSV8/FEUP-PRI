    "transcript": "What's up guys, Lew here back with another video. And today I've got something...that... I've actually had my eye on for a little while. What we're looking at...is a Panasonic product... the DMC-CM1 from the Lumix line. So... everything so far is pointing at \"camera\" ...but the weird part is, it's also a phone. I, for a long time, have been interested in... kind of the \"ultimate social instagram/twitter camera\" Lemme just... lemme just open it up. This guy features a one-inch sensor. That's the same size as the Sony RX-100 That is a substantial sensor. And look at it... But it's not... But it's still... You know it's kind of like the size... At least from the front, of a phone. Now, granted, it's, it's fatter. But it's not crazy fat. You've got a nice, big aperture on the lens f2.8 You have a dedicated shutter button Camera switch over here, the power switch There's even a tiny little forward-facing camera [to Jack] Can you catch that there Jack? Kind of an unusual layout, the headphone jack is in this location here, And I assume this is where you'll put your memory card ...no, that's your USB Port. There we go. SIM Card slot and MicroSDXC. So what else do we have here? Pretty straightforward, a char... a BIG charger. Holy smokes! Oh, it is a Qualcom QuickCharger 2.0, okay. So it's gonna charge faster. Alright then. This is a quicker publishing method for photography that looks more like dedicated camera photography. Look at my hands right now. There we go. Update... succesful. And we have, actually a fairly... a fairly stock look in Android here. 5.0, 4k Photo, 4k Pre-Burst So you see it actually, [to Jack] Check that out Jack. It extends a little bit. It's not huge. I'm kicking it old-school. When I was a little kid, and I got a new gadget, I would take the... user manual, to bed as my reading before I went to sleep. This was my [New E?] magazine right here. Panasonic is positioning this as a connected camera, not a smartphone. The lens also happens to be fixed, so... Might have been nice to have a little bit of zoom here but they've opted for a fixed lens like a lot of other smartphones in order to protect the form factor. Now, the camera app is gonna be what you're most interested in, you can launch it a couple of different ways, either just by tapping the icon or this little slide at the top which is gonna get you access a lot quicker. You can see the autofocus working here ...as I move in. [Beep] Boom! [Beep] Boom! [Beep] Boom! [Beep] Boom! You guys hear that? [Shutter sound] Like that's... [Beep] [Shutter sound] That's quick! Certainly a photo-first experience. [Beep] [Shutter sound] It's just different. [Beep] And, of course, having complete manual control you can map this ring on the front for focus, zoom; whatever you want. Now I wouldn't recommend using the zoom, it is a fixed focal length, so you're working with digital zoom there. Never advisable, you're only gonna be using a portion of the sensor. Granted, you're looking at a one-inch sensor here which is about seven times bigger than your average smartphone sensor. So if there were a sensor to use digital zoom on, this would be it. The 4k video is only operating at 15fps, so You might hope, at this pricepoint, to be getting 4k at 30fps since a lot of phones do that. But again, I feel like this is mostly aimed at still photos. Let's see how wide this guy is. [Beep] [Shutter sound] One thing you can do here that you couldn't necessarily do as easily with a lot of other cameras on the market is do like an automatic backup. You could connect your Google Drive, or use Google Photos, whatever you wanna do because you've got Android right here. A couple of 4k features here, It's got something called \"PreBurst\" which is going to actually be recording bursts of 4k resolution frames prior to you hitting the record button. If you're anticipating action, then you can set up PreBurst and when that action happens actually go back in time so you didn't miss it. What would you say, like, what is it, business on the front, party on the back? Or would it be the other way around? Business the back, party on the front. I like seeing when tech companies do something ...strange; ambitious, if you will. They're not gonna sell a ton of these but they decided to make it anyways? Let's say I got this thing in my pocket, let's do a quick... (with accent) Boom! Slide over to the camera! [Shutter sound] SHOT! Boom! And that's... That's like a macro focus situation! [Shutter sound] Look how quickly... [Beep] [Shutter sound] Look how quickly it gets focus on me. Maybe I'm too excited about this? I certainly don't look excited in this frame right here. But anywhere you wanna share still images this is probably the best you're gonna be able to do immediately. This is the CM1; DMC-CM1 from Panasonic I think we're gonna have some fun together. We've obviously gone to the extreme here. What exactly went down? I'm gonna pull this out.",

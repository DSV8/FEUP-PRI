    "transcript": "(pensive music) - So if you couldn't tell, I'm a pretty big fan of Ed Sheeran. I've dug his music for a couple of years now. I saw him live, which was amazing. Then recently a couple of months ago, Divide came out. Naturally I was super excited. And I swear, I must've listened to that album for like two weeks straight. And during that time, I remember it was late at night, I was frantically running back up and down stairs trying to fill circles on my Apple watch. And while I was listening to it I thought it would be amazing to do an Ed Sheeran dream desk. Now I totally understand when you hear those words together it might sound a little silly. In fact, I remember the very next morning I told Austin at the gym I'm gonna make an Ed Sheeran dream desk and naturally he kinda laughed at me. What I think he had in his head was probably more like a fan desk with autographs and pictures. But for me, it was more than just the music something about the divide symbol, the color blue, I thought it would be amazing if I could somehow implement that into a desk. At one point I even talked to my buddy Chris over at Foureyes' Furniture to potentially make a custom desk for this. But then it was at that point when I realized that I had the answer right in front of me the entire time. This desk here, which we already had, by itself is beautiful. But what makes it so special is on the back, or in this case the front because of how I have it set up, it attaches magnetically. At its core it's used for cable management, but it kinda set off this lightbulb in my brain that this would be perfect. What I kinda saw in my head was this semi-transparent divide symbol that we could shoot colored light at, and not only get that divide blue, but if we wanted to throw back to orange or green, we could do that too. From there Chris was able to whip up some concepts that looked amazing. So I gave him the green light, not only to cut out that portion of the panel, but also to have that acrylic made. And I think the end result is amazing. Now with this dream desk, it was less about the set up or the computer or the tech or the gadgets, and more so about the desk itself. For me, it didn't matter if it was a Microsoft Surface Studio, the original 1984 Macintosh or a picture of DJ Khaled, this was about the desk. I'm in love with the shape of you We push and pull like a magnet do And though my heart is falling too I'm in love with your body And last night you were in my room And now my bedsheets smell like you Every day discovering something brand new I'm in love with your body - Now this is the point of the video where I would normally find someone and surprise them with something really, really cool, but this dream desk is different. My initial plan was to find an Ed Sheeran super fan and then surprise them in this video with tickets to an upcoming concert, but in searching for that fan, I stumbled upon a tweet that changed everything. This tweet here is from this amazing mother, Sheryl, who had reached out to Ed Sheeran in hopes of him maybe dedicating a verse or a song to her baby boy Thomas, who had terminal cancer. - And all I could think of was Ed Sheeran. And obviously it was like emotions and I'm like oh I'm gonna, I'm gonna tweet Ed Sheeran. So that was the initial reason for that. And then you got it. So maybe that's one step towards Ed Sheeran, but we'll never know. So about six weeks old for Thomas, we saw him and he was doing all the checks and making sure that he's growing fine and development, like responding well and like sounds and light and things like that. And then he felt a lump on his abdomen. And since like we saw the doctor the next day and it just snowballed from there. Like he was already ringing the children's hospital and the following week, when he was 11 weeks, they just said the cancer has spread, 'cause they found nodules in his lungs as well and his hip, he can't move his right leg anymore. And it started at the hospital and we were like wondering what's wrong with it? Is it something from the surgery, but they said no, there's a tumor now. - Now at this point I was already so emotionally attached to this, but it wasn't until the point where Sheryl flipped the camera and I saw Thomas, and that broke my heart. - [Sheryl] But he just, he looks unsuspecting stranger will know nothing, they'll just think that he's, yeah, like a baby. - Here was this beautiful innocent baby boy who's laughing, who's smiling. All I could think to myself is he does not deserve this. - Hey Daddy. What's Daddy doing? Hi Daddy. - Now from there I was fixated on trying to make this happen. I was on Twitter, I was Instagram, I was e-mailing anyone I could possibly think of that could potentially help. I did this week after week after week. I didn't care that the next dream desk was delayed. I just wanted to help make this happen. So fast forward to a couple weeks ago, I'm still trying, I don't wanna give up. But then I see a tweet from Sheryl and learned that baby Thomas passed away. So at that point I kinda felt like I failed them, like I let 'em down, I couldn't pull through. But then thinking of Sheryl and how strong she's been, this was nothing compared to what she has to deal with or her husband or her baby boy. So with that I wanted to finish this dream desk. Maybe somehow, some way, Ed Sheeran will see this and reach out to Sheryl. So if you guys can help in any way by sharing this, that would be amazing. Sheryl thank you so much for letting me into your family, for giving me a chance to know Thomas. I'm so sorry for everything you've had to go through. You're an incredible mother and I know you're gonna inspire so many people. 'Cause you are my one and only You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb And hold me tight - [Kid] I love you so much. - Thomas. - Thomas. - Thomas. - Thomas. - Thomas. - Thomas. - Thomas. - Thomas. - Thomas. - Thomas. - I am sorry you had to go through that little buddy, but I promise you, you will never be forgotten. You're just a small boy, so young Two years torn from life Maybe you were needed up there But we're still unaware is why",

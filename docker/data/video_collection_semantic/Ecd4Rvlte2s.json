    "description": "The Creative claims their new SFXI Gamer has the best microphone and surround sound of any gaming headset currently available.  Those are some pretty bold statements considering all of the amazing options in the wired gaming headset category.  With a price of about $130, there's other options like the PC37X, Logitech G PRO X and some others but this one actually has a USB-C connector making it a bit more unique.  But is all of this worth your time and money?  We review it in FPS games, MOBA games and more in order to see if the Creative SXFI gamer is really the best gaming headset of 2020 and how good its build quality is.

    "transcript": "good people I'm Dimitri and today we're taking a look at the SXFI gamer headset from creative labs the thing is I do not actually want to review this headset until they emailed us with two big claims saying this is the best microphone on any game a headset the commander pro microphone so let's test out if this actually sounds the best and versus my entire gaming headset collection and number two they claim it also has the best surround sound gaming experience using their holographic algorithm that maps out the ear and your head size and gives you a more personalized approach to surround sound audio that has been specifically tuned for eSports and that to me is kind of bizarre element in the first place because normally you don't enable surround sound for csgo for battlefield for Call of Duty because that usually mutes out all the important elements whereas with creative they claim with the new battle mode it gives you the best directionality and the best positional awareness and also takes into account the distance of audio cues so not only does it expand your environment but does it so accurately for eSports and so that is why I'm excited to check out the SXFi Gamer by the way the proper way to say as SXFI Gamer is sexified gamer wing and do that so I've been using this headset for the past week and I'm excited to share my experience testing their claims about this being the best microphone in class and their surround sound for eSports games alright let's check it out right after this what does it take to experience a compact high performance gaming notebook you want specs that can meet the most demanding tasks like a fast CPU up to 32 gigabytes of RAM ultra-fast nvme SSD and r-tx graphics you also want something that's a lightweight and easy to carry around how about a robust optical mechanical keyboard with perky RGB lighting and a fast 144 Hertz IPS display this is a new xbg senior gaming notebook check it out at the links below and to the extreme alright so first of all it's pretty competitively priced at $129 so going against PC 37X Logitech G Pro X but this being a USB type-c headset you're not relying on any sound processing based on your motherboard based on your sound card as all the processing is done on the headset the USBC cable here is reinforced kevlar whatever that means I'm guessing it's pretty strong but it does send out a bunch of cable noise directly into the ear cup so you better not have this rub against your shirt or somewhere else around or move too much with the headset because all that movement will be audible since there is a USBC headset we have a USB a to use PC dongle which is pretty compact and most likely will be attached to the actual cable when you travel or when you need to replug it in if you don't have a type C cable available on your machine but there is no way to actually store this with the headset so I would recommend plugging it into the cable if you don't want to lose this we also have a 3.5 million in beside the USB type-c so you can use this headset in wired analog operation but of course you lose out on that beautiful RGB illumination I really like the consistency and uniformity of the illumination and they're going after the whole spaceship x-gamer e vibes without looking kind of stupid note quality is fine no rattling anywhere even once you stretch out the headset to almost its maximum at 349 grams it's not exactly lightweight and most of the padding is actually on the ear cups so there leatherette really thick and nice soft memory foam like material unfortunately there is no padding inside the ear cup so that means that you can feel the plastic housing on the driver right underneath in case your ear makes contact it will not be comfortable and number two I'm surprised at how little padding there is on the headband and for me personally the clamping force is enough to stabilize the headset on my head without relying too much on the headband and the clamping force here is absolutely perfect no issues wearing this thing for hours but do keep in mind this is a closed design so heat accumulation inside does happen there is a bit of wiggle room on the ear cups to conform to your head size and there is some plastic on plastic contact I find it really interesting that the ear cups are removal yet no replacement velour pads are included with the package which normally come with like a gaming headset at this price point but not here let there only but overall I'd say it's pretty good pair comfort wise and build quality wise also given the really thick ear cushions wearing glasses with the gamer absolutely no issues here even though this is a really low profile frame there's no clamping anywhere it's nice all of your controls are on the left side with the sx fi button to enable surround sound mode on/off or enable battle mode we have a volume wheel that has no tactility whatsoever but volume adjustment is instantaneous which is great and we have a mic mute button below the microphone of course is removable and there is no attachable pop filter because that is built into the microphone itself and I do appreciate the red LED indicating when the microphone is working when it's solid and when it's mute it does flash and red I also appreciate this LED indicator because it has to face your mouth in order to have the best pickup because even the slightest like it's facing down the volume pickup for the microphone will be completely different and you'll sound way too distant and finally you can change the illumination mode directly from the headset with the button above the microphone giving you the preset color that you choose versus cycle and off for a little added user experience there's an announcer voice built-in so when you change the SXFI modes you can hear what is being enabled or disabled and the same thing with mic on or off alright so let's begin with the microphone test what you listening now is the commander microphone by the SXFI Gamer first of all there is built-in site own something that is there by default you cannot remove it aka you can hear slightly yourself like it's not completely muted which i would say is a positive thing but normally you have the option to adjust the site tone volume and multiple other scenarios would USB headsets here you cannot I will say I really like the implementation of the led when the microphone is working because otherwise like if I position the microphone slightly down where the LED is facing my mouth like my neck like even this would appear to be normal right but I sound a lot more distant than if I position the facing my lips as for noise suppression you guys can probably hear a little bit of modulation in my volume because it's trying to suppress whatever is happening in the ambient environment which right now is pretty quiet but if I was to try a start typing you can maybe hear a little bit of modulation that is happening with RTX voice I think companies are trying to scramble to see who has the best solution in terms of like noise suppression but creative here's trying to do is deliver a more balanced approach so it doesn't completely isolate all the keystrokes for example and like little banging and stuff around your environment but I think it does a good job as for the microphone quality let me know what you think how does it sound to your ears what I'm hearing is nice bass pickup good clarity without me sounding nasally nor too muddy I wouldn't necessarily say it's like a broadcast quality microphone but it's definitely getting up there next up is the Sennheiser PC37X this is my benchmark gaming microphone I think it sounds fantastic it does have a bit more of that pop pick up even though it has a built-in pop filter but it has great bass nice clarity great full body sound not as nasally as other gaming microphones and now let's check out the Logitech G Pro X and now we're listening to the G Pro X headset by Logitech and so this one with the collaboration with Blu voice the software suite is quite powerful but the microphone I think is not capable in delivering what the software can do in terms of changing the different equalizer settings for the volkl pickup and it's kind of standard let me know what you think between the three which one sounded best two years and finally let's talk about the sound quality and whether or not the SXFI Ggamer delivers on their initial claim of having the best FPS sound mode aka battle mode when short what battle mode is it creates this virtual distance awareness that can give you an advantage in knowing exactly how far certain audio keys are coming from and I think it's still a stereo reproduction but there's some clever tweaking in here so that the highs are boosted without it sounding crunchy while the super XFI SXFI modes it creates a surround sound note virtual personalized multi-channel multi-directional recreation and to be honest I lowered my expectations when jumping into a game using battle mode but then I realized when you disable it just how much better it is when battle mode is enabled for FPS games like Cod bf5 csgo and escape from tarkov by default the headset is quite neutral with a lot of power this is USB powered after all with a little double beep when you reach maximum volume but good base nice clarity on the high end the mid-range isn't pushed too far forward it isn't too too close either I would say it's a really good sounding pair for gaming by default and of course it's really important to have that baseline covered before introducing any of the sound modes and so let me talk about battle mode first because I think it is quite game-changing in battlefield 5 with it disabled the game almost sounds flat even though it isn't it's a beautiful sound engine but when battle mode is enabled it's almost like applying contrast to an image so the highs are amplified your directional awareness becomes so much more apparent and like pinpointing exactly where footsteps are coming from and how far they are and on what level they are so not only do we have verticality we have very good directionality or distance measurement with battle mode enabled now jumping into csgo I did not find battle mode as useful there as I did with ba5 just because csgo I mean the sound engine is good already by default in terms of being able to hear things being able to position things within the map and so you don't necessarily need to emphasise that anymore and in fact I found it to kind of go the other way where it gave me less of an enjoyable audio then when battle mode is disabled however where I think battle mode is absolutely amazing is escape from tarkov so in that game you have different headsets that your character can wear to amplify different frequencies of audio inside the game and so battle mode almost does that for you without the need to actually wear the head that on your character in game so for EFT when battle mode is enabled I felt like I had an advantage because the highs were boosted but not too sharp and this isn't something that I've been able to recreate simply with EQ tweaking so I'm not sure what they're doing in their algorithm and making sure they're feeding the source audio and here to recreate a really good positional like audio reproduction but it gave me full awareness of verticality distance and on a small map like Factory I had total awareness so where enemies were coming from as you can see by that game play and even when I went through to a larger map like shoreline having a sniper that is shooting a kilometer away gave me that perfect distance measurement almost like I could sense they're really far away while the game by itself would also give you that but battle mode kind of gives you an advantage in that sense where you don't have to boost the volume on the headphone simply enabling battle mode gives you better clarity without it sounding too harsh or like really tamed and so from my experience battle mode is helpful and really busy audio engines ba5 aft but I didn't particularly find it useful in csgo and now let's talk about the SXFI surround sound mode and that one I'm not entirely convinced as necessary just because there are many roadblocks along the way to get you to actually enjoy it so first of all you need to download an app on your phone take picture of your ear and your face and it generates a more personalized all you experience when it comes to surround sound you need to then install an applications for the desktop sign into your super x5 profile and use that for the surround sound experience so the issues can begin from the beginning I encountered multiple crashes on my iPhone and that normally doesn't happen and also whenever I try to download the sound profile SXFI through the desktop app it sometimes just wouldn't download it but when it finally does work it does expand your audience and it is one of the better surround sound modes that I've experienced still not as good as what son Heiser does with gsx 1000 but this is like a close second what is trying to do is recreate audio as if it was playing out of speakers in front of you and in many situations that could be an enjoyable experience for example if you don't feel like wearing headphones and having that almost closed sound turning on super X Phi gives you that open sound it's still not perfect as many audio cues and game just completely get pushed too far out and like you don't hear the particular audio cues that you would in stereo for example the dialogue and Red Dead Redemption to just tone it a little bit off when SXFI was enabled while still allow me to expand the audio environment but I want to enjoy the important elements in the game and in stereo mode you can still enjoy the environment and its massive audio stage without SXFI alright so I think its conclusion time and what creative have delivered here is a headset that is trying to be soup ambitious and catering to the FPS market to the eSports market while introducing features that are normally like shunned upon and pushed aside when it comes to exactly that gamer style and I think they've succeeded here with battle mode that I do not play without when it comes to escape from tarkov the microphone quality as you heard is kind of broadcasting not exactly there and I think they have a bit too of aggressive modulation and volume making sure that you're heard regardless of how loud you speak it is pretty impressive to hear the difference between personalized and 6fi profile versus it not being there and I think they're onto something but it's gonna take a lot of convincing for people because I've been not recommending surround sound at all and now I'm kind of flip-flopping back and I still don't recommend it for everything but I mean battle mode is a different thing but as sexify it's kind of cool for a certain genre of games but I wouldn't necessarily buy this headset for that particular reason I think creative is onto something here catering to the gaming community with something super unconventional and maybe more gaming audio brands should follow adding a little bit of flair to their gaming headsets so that you can have a bit of an advantage you know it's like placing a digital crosshair from your monitor to give you an advantage in some titles it's kind of the same thing here almost like adding contrast to the audio environment so that things that are important are audible and things that are not so important are muted in the background but I think I'm done blabbering about this headset for now thank you so much for watching let me know what you think of the audio quality again check out this other relevant content subscribe for more I'll talk to you next blessed games",

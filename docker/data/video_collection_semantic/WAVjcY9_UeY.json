    "transcript": "(birds chirping) (upbeat music) - Recognize this place? Very famous, Stonehenge. Beautiful, beautiful day. What are you gonna do with your life today to make your tomorrow better? (upbeat music) What are you gonna do today to make your life better tomorrow? Are you working for the long term or just for the short term? You need to think long term, don't think short term. So again, what are you doing today to make your tomorrows better? What are you doing with your time today? Are you studying? Are you investing in yourself? Are you investing in your future, or are you wasting your time? (upbeat music) Make sure that your future self, in other words, yourself two years from today or five years from today, or 10 or 20 years from today, thanks you for what you did today and what you're going to do every day from now on to make your future better. Think about it as follows, if you just invest a bit of time every day making yourself better, improving yourself, you will exponentially improve yourself in the coming years. Don't spend time on things that don't make a difference, don't spend time on things that are here today and gone tomorrow. Spend time on things that will improve your life but also improve the lives of your children and perhaps your grandchildren in future. Invest with the long-term in mind. Now I've mentioned this book in the past and I'll mention it again, Atomic Habits, fantastic book. Talks about this whole paradigm or way of thinking that if you make incremental changes in your life today, small changes, it can make a huge difference over a period of months or years. 1% change every day, 1% improvement every day makes a dramatic improvement over a period of time. If you just improve your life little by little every day, it makes a massive change over a number of months or years. But now let's get practical, people often ask, how do I improve my life? How do I make things better? Now, forgive the boomer statement now but in the past it was a lot more difficult to find information to study. I remember the days of teaching Cisco classes in person used to cost thousands and thousands of dollars for a in-person class that was only available to people who were rich or only available to companies. But today, because of platforms such as YouTube or Udemy, or Hack The Box, it's now possible to get access to amazing information for free, or for low cost. There's fantastic training available on YouTube for free, fantastic training available on Udemy for low cost. I mean, paying $10 for a CCNA course was unbelievable a number of years ago. You can now improve your life by investing in yourself. Always invest in yourself first, don't go and spend your money on something like a car that depreciates in value. Spend money, spend time on things that appreciate in value such as yourself or property, or something that increases in value. Make sure that you invest in yourself. And to help us do that today, I really wanna thank Todd Lammle the author of these famous CCNA books. He's sponsoring today's giveaway, six people are gonna win books written by Todd Lammle. Now there is a caveat or a restriction here, this only applies to the blue books as listed on Todd's website it does not apply to these books because Todd didn't self publish these books they are published by Cybex. But you can win any one of the books that Todd has self-published. In other words, the blue books listed on his website. Use the link below to enter to win one of Todd's books but wait, there's more, as they say, really wanna thank Todd for sponsoring this giveaway, three people are gonna win platinum access to lemmle.com. The value of this prize is $299. You'll get access to a whole bunch of content, CCNA content, CCIE content, a whole bunch of other content, including AWS training and a lot more. Really wanna thank Todd for supporting me, he's often given me stuff to give to you so really wanna thank him for that support. Three people are gonna win platinum access to lemmle.com. Please make sure that you show him your appreciation by following him on Twitter, connecting with him on LinkedIn, but also checking out his offers on his website. Todd has really supported me and given me a lot of stuff to give to you, so please make sure that you show him your appreciation. Okay, with that being said, make sure that you spend your time improving your life. What are you gonna do in the next 12 months to improve your life? Set goals for yourself, but make sure that every day you practically do something to improve your life. Goals are okay, but you can't just write them down, they don't happen by themselves you've got to make it happen. So every day, do something to help you reach your goals. I'm David Bombal, wanna wish you all the very best. (upbeat music)",

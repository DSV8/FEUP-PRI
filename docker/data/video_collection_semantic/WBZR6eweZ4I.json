    "transcript": "now, as you can tell by the huge pile of moving crates behind me, after two and a half years it's finally time to move to a new much bigger space but before we embark on that huge undertaking there's one pretty big problem with the new space we need to solve [Music] first so this is the new office space and as you can tell it is a palace compared to the previous one but aside from the massive size increase as you can probably hear there's a big problem with this space the the Absurd echo which we definitely have to deal with but before getting started with my grandiose construction plans I needed to get sciency and measure the echo with my calibrated microphone now to measure the echo I use software called room EQ with which plays a consistent frequency sweep over the entire audible Spectrum which can be used for a bunch of things but here I'm using it to measure the Decay time of that frequency sweep okay now the the measurements are kind of wild and I'm probably going to explain why with voice over because this Echo is really crazy after room EQ wizard does the measurements it shows the results in a graph like this now I'm sure a bunch of you are primed to click off this video the moment a graph showed up but don't worry it's pretty straightforward it's called an rt60 graph which plots how long it takes a sound at any given frequency to reduce its volume by 60 DB hence reverberation time 60 so the higher the number the longer the echo rings in the room see that wasn't too bad now in a bigger room the ideal rt60 is between 0.4 and 0.6 seconds whereas the result I measured from my new space looked like this with Peak Reverb times of over 2 seconds which is the kind of numbers that puts a mediumsized indoor swimming pool to shame and because I don't want to bankrupt myself sound treating this space I came up with a plan to build my own big ass sound panels which considering my checkered history with manual labor should go very well step number one get some wood but once I loaded all of the wood we calculated we needed the scale of the undertaking became clear especially considering the new office is up four flights of stairs and once all the wood was loaded I also needed to buy some rock wool insulation which is going to function as the acoustic absorber in the [Laughter] panels we just need to edit that no and after just carrying a single bail of rock wall up four flights of stairs I was already considering faking my own death just to get out of this rental contract okay so how many do we have here this is Oh Come come on so I had to slog back to the Rona for a single piece of py brown now for this project I decided to build huge 2 and 1/2 M squared sound panels as opposed to something more reasonably sized like the ones behind me here which are a lot more efficient at covering just a lot of surface area on the walls but the reason that I'm going with huge panels instead is because my new office is wedged between two other off offes separated by what I can only describe as Paper Walls and not only are they quite noisy I also don't want my constant shouting about goria disturbing them so I want the option in the future if it's necessary to expand these huge panels into full double walls separating me from the other offices so with that let's get to the building the first panel needs to fit under this air conduct in front of this door so I did some very professional measurements in preparation for cutting now now when it comes to The Cutting I don't have any power tools but according to some guy on Reddit this meter box with the included saw is a great peasant solution but I quickly discovered a huge shortcoming to this method there's no other way to put it manually sewing sucks oh no way that single piece has basically broken my spirit and there's still there's still that much left now in cutting the next piece of wood I realized that because of friction as you get deeper into the piece of wood it gets harder to sort so I had the genius idea of halfway through turning the plank around and starting again with less friction from the top which did make the second piece easier but it still felt like bamboo fingernail torture on my nerd body and there was another problem okay well my strategy of turning it over halfway through the cut is makes it way easier but uh we do need to perfect it a little bit because we did go a bit skew uh despite our meter box or whatever but that bit of suffering has given us our two vertical pieces so I can now make the outer frame before I have to cut down the like beams that is huge and now we get to the very exciting part of figuring out that I bought the wrong screws to get this all to go together so yay let's do that but luckily the screws worked very well and soon the outer frame was finished so we now have the outside of a frame that was very professionally screwed together by me uh but now we need to do the beams so I need to measure them out and then I am going to have to cut them so there's quite a lot more sewing that needs to happen but it's going to just be for this panel I'm going to rearrange how I connect them with the other panels cuz we have less of a of a height concern with those so that I don't have to cut any beams and just like that it was time for me to get back to what felt like Eternal damnation of sowing so much suffering and pain oh thank God but with the last beam cut I was ready to screw together the hardest to assemble frame the other two frames were way easier I just had to measure out the beam spacing so the rock wall will fit between them and then screw them together the only issue I had here was with all this screwing my drills started to overheat but luckily I had a great solution [Music] I then reinforced the corners with metal brackets before enlisting Anna's help with covering them in fabric because the panels was so massive Anna had to seam together two pieces of fabric to cover their entire footprint once Anna finished we put the frames on the fabric and used a staple gun to try and tension the fabric over the frame the reason we used fabric as a wall front was so that sound could penetrate it and get absorbed in the rock wall once the fabric was attached to the frames it was time to fill it with rock wool now rock wool may be a great insulator but it kind of sucks to work with because you can't make skin contact with it it feels like you're stuffing your panel with a hive full of angry bees but once the panel was stuffed to the brim we stretched over and stapled down some backing material to keep the rock wool in and preventing us from ever accidentally touching it and getting whatever the skin equivalent of a urinary tract infection is the final couple steps was attaching some shelving brackets at the B bot of the panel that function as feet starting with the two in the back and then lifting the panel and attaching two more on the front while Anna held it [Applause] up well now comes the Moment of Truth we need to hope that that fits under that pipe oh and it did it fit like a glove which means after what felt like an eternity the panels were finally finished and it was time to admire them in all their monolithic Majesty [Music] and now comes the most important bit we have to see how much of a difference it made now remember the initial measurement which looked like this massive mountain of terrible Reverb with peaks of over 2 seconds but after we put the panels in it went from that to this which is a huge Improvement now it's still not perfect but it's a lot better and remember this is in a huge open room without any furniture in it that's basically made of reflective surfaces so once we put Furniture in there it's going to be way better than that we're also going to lay some carpet and stuff in areas to help with that very acoustically reflective wooden floor uh but all in all I'm pretty happy with the result which brings me to the end of the video thank you very much for watching next week at some point I'm going to bring out a video documenting the move you'll see the current state of this space which is kind of wild and the process of moving the huge mountain of tech from here to the new office which should should be very fun uh anyway if you don't want to miss that subscribe to the channel and until then bye-bye [Music] w",

    "transcript": "today's video is sponsored by Corsair where Anna will be building one of corsair's fancy new DIY PC kids how are you feeling about that I'm feeling pretty good so the last time I built a PC was more than a year ago and how well did the last time go there was one fatal error so the PC kept crashing um and I think that may be the reason why but now that I know not to forget that let's hope that nothing else bad happens thank you oh these are the unpacking instructions and with the crystal clear instructions Anna managed to unpack the Corsair build kit available in the link in the description like a pro this be difficult after which Anna QR coded some build instructions this is where the page where the QR code leads you open your Corsair build kit verify you received all of the hardware using the hardware checklist provided and Asana soon found out there was only one thing Corsair forgot to pack what about your mama is that on that list uh so we're going to organize and place all your components on the top sheet to protect your components and tabletop as you can see David does not do that usually and his tabletop is screwed very much not protected yeah times and once inside the case Anna discovered her nemesis I don't think I'm allowed to help you here like I said don't think so I don't know if I get the knife involved so quickly there you go I did it removed the motherboard from its packaging and place it on the anti-static bag provided Anna Then skillfully followed the CPU installation instructions here's the little triangle and there's the little triangle but it didn't take Anna long to discover Nemesis 2.0 yeah that's not right that's a long screwdriver but eventually Anna figured it out and could get to some screwing okay next we're gonna uninstall no unpack and install our rim but I screwed them all down after retrieving the screwdriver Anna discovered the joys of front i o cable installation that is very not correct no but a quick look at the manual and Anna figured it out in no time next we're going to do the CPU power cable cooler and fan installation I think it's my birthday and I like the fact that they've chosen their own gamery shape you know so there's a cohesiveness so it said to get out the CPU oh I see CPU install the necessary CPU power cables in the top left corner of the motherboard next okay install the two fans onto the radiator as exhaust using the long screws is this gonna go here I think and then this is going to go here so we want the fans to go on this side do you ever think Okay so I'm also gonna have the fans so that the the logo is the same and the fans are kind of oriented oh it's gonna yeah there's something really satisfying about this like more than I was expecting there like it would be hard so it says attach the provided Intel standoff for your socket yes so they said to remove the fan that's at the front and then we're going to replace it with these oh look at that bank of fans nice and I got the cables out the side good the little holes here so um this should be nice and easy for cable management click your so I've just unpacked the GPU so I have to remove the second third and fourth screws and back plates install the graphics are on the first pcie slot on the motherboard secure the graphics card with the case screws that were removed in step one of this section do we take the plastic off before uh what is your gut to tell you my gut's telling me to do it now so I've just pushed pushed little Graphics called Lippy thing down saying that this is right depending on the model of your graphics card you may need two GPU power cables if your graphics card includes a power adapter connect the adapter to the GPU then connect the GPU power cables to the adapter thank you yay that thought looks pretty neat okay that's so professional thank you I'm actually gonna put it with a fan facing at the bottom a good time can you just shove I can just go at the top okay that's the closest I've gotten it a whole oh oh no it's so messy hey honestly if the back panel goes on that's the only thing that matters that's the only measurement yeah that's the only measure of success oh okay okay and after not much time stuffing cables and holes Anna was ready for the final rear panel struggle oh ah there hey hey it's on and after that surprisingly easy panel fit there was just one thing left to do before firing it up do you think it's gonna work I do okay cool let's see okay I'm gonna flip the switch at the back oh I I always forget to do that yeah that's a good job can we have flip the switch the wrong way I love that you did end up debating new CPU installed but before we see how the system runs after Anna set up the pre-installed Windows let's quickly admire Anna's handiwork and I decided to do some cyberpunk and we had to crank the crap out of the settings because this is 1080p are you ready I am I don't do much driving oh yeah it's the worst car ever and what do my clicks do nothing in the car yeah so this is with Ray tracing on medium yeah look at the the light reflecting like the sun reflecting off of her yeah look at that car wow temperatures are very good it's nice and quiet so Anna what what was it like it was it was a really fun experience less scary than I thought it was going to be and it's a surprisingly therapeutic process at the end of it I feel like I'm accomplished like yeah you did you build a species laughs",

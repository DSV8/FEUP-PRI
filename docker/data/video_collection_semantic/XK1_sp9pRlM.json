    "transcript": "- [Krazy Ken] Hey, look at that, I drew box. Shit! I'm gonna find a professional graphic illustrator, put them on this computer, and see what they can draw. We're gonna boot this sucker up. (clicks) - [Ken] It's doing absolutely nothing. That's a good sign. - [Heidi] Well that's a big foot. - [Ken] Cute. - [Heidi] Command Z - [Ken] Aww, I wish. Okay so just a tiny little problem, and by tiny problem I mean catastrophic and now the whole project is gonna be halted. (radar beeping) (upbeat electronic music) - [Ken] Hey guys, how are you all doing? Really, that's just great. You know I'm doing doing pretty great today too because a generous, generous viewer, donated this to me. Mint in the shrink wrap and in the box. The KoalaPad TouchTablet for the Apple //e and //c with the graphics software included. Check this thing out man. A stylus, who want's a stylus? You gotta get 'em and put 'em away and you lose them, bleh. Nobody wants a stylus, so let's not use a stylus. The only thing is though is it's the 80s, so let's just use one okay? This is what it looks like. Computer graphics, children's education, business graphics, free hand drawing, business software controller. On the back are some cheery pictures of people using it. Charts and graphs, the Nostalgia Critic's brother would be very happy. Tools for education, music, spelling, mathematics, logo, L O G O must be a program or something. Colorful designs, high resolution graphics. So okay, we can do a lot of things with this. We can draw with this. So here's the fun thing, I know of some professional illustrators, some very talented people. So if I can get this thing working, I'd like to see them ditch their iPad Pros and their Wacom Intuos, Cintiq devices, and try drawing something on this bad boy. Wouldn't that be fun? So first we have to unbox it and then we actually have to get it working with something. Oops, I think just face planted it. Yeah, I have an Apple //e that has not been used probably in over a decade or so and I have a monitor to go with it, that also has not been turned on in, I'd say at least 10 years. I have no idea if any of that stuff even works but we're gonna plug it in and try it together. But first, let's do something a lot easier. Let's pop this box's cherry. Alright, this is like a time capsule. You know I'm gonna do this a little more delicately. Ooh, that is some tougher shrink wrap than I'm used to. Holy shit. Oh my gosh. Wow, the 80s did not (beep) around. Whoa, holy bananas dude. Oh hang on, there's, we have a little bit of like a hole right here. We can just go in there, so I guess it isn't 100% shrink wrapped, now the value just went down by 200%. (crinkling and ripping plastic) - [Ken] I'm trying to be like super careful with this. Okay, well, there's the shrink wrap. I'm not sure what happened here, but there's clearly some discoloration. It even feels different, like over here, compared to here. I have no idea what did that. It looks like we have a little flap right here. See if we can infiltrate the fortress. (popping) - [Ken] There we go. And I'm guessing this way. This is kinda like that MacBook Air commercial now, where they're taking the computer out of the manila envelope. (humming and singing) - [Ken] I'm a new soul when I came to this strange world Hoping I would learn about a Something I don't remember the words. Alright, ladies, gentlemen and every thing in between, I present to you the KoalaPad. Oh my gosh. KoalaPad TouchTablet owners Manuel. Let's start inside here, Oh hey, there's our stylus. Look at that. Here's the stylus. It has like, it even sounds like a pencil. It kinda feels like a pencil with a slightly rougher exterior, but it's light. It's light, it's light like an actual pencil. That is. Wow, that feels like a freaking pencil. Like it even sounds like a pencil. When you hit it against this beautiful Aspen table. The KoalaPainter owner's manual. Looks like we got some little pictograms in there. I'm sure we'll refer to that later. Important from time to time we would like to keep you informed of new software developments. Oh my gosh, back when you had to freakin mail this stuff in. Warranty registration card. Santa Clara, California. I was just there, I was literally just there. I doubt these guys are around anymore. I don't know who's in that office right now. I don't know, I need to look these guys up. I wonder who bought them out or maybe they just went bankrupt or something, I really don't know. This is the fun part. KoalaPainter, trademark of Koala Technologies, 1983. Here is our diskette. That is a very clean looking diskette. I mean this was mint, like usually my diskettes, that I have are you know they've been used for years by other people. This is actually like really clean and really beautiful. I wanna make sure that stays in it's sleeve for now. We'll get to that soon, once we bust out the Unidisk. With the Apple //e enhanced and yes, there is an Apple //e enhanced. There were some people commenting about that. Saying that the e stood for enhanced. Yes, I know, but there was literally an Apple //e and an Apple //e Enhanced. It may be redundant but there were two different models, okay. At least two different models. And here is the Koala pad itself. Well, that wasn't very climatic. I'm just gonna brush some of the packing peanuts off of here or the styrofoam I should say. So it looks like the surface got a little wrinkly. So I don't know if the box got damaged, but it did look like the box was also a bit dented, so I'm guessing this thing got hit by something. Looks like it's a little damaged there, but the rest looks very clean, like very untouched, by humans hands. It's even got a little twist tie still. This is great, oh my gosh, I cannot wait. Wow, just. Credit card payment, boop. There we go. It's a super minimalistic design. Like this is pretty awesome for the 80s even. Like especially for the 80s, this is cool. This feels better then a lot of those things you freaking sign with, you know like you're buying something at the store and you sign for your credit card or whatever. This is like legit. So I'm gonna bust out the //e and the monitor, see if I can get those things working. Oh I'm scared. I have all the components, I just don't know if they work. Alright, well, we're in this together, let's do it. And kaboom here we go an Apple //e Enhanched with our power there, our slots and I believe we just use the, I don't know if that's called the joystick port or whatever. I'm just looking at the shape of it and it matches what's on the freaking tablet. So I think we'll be okay. As for the video interface it looks like we have composite, pretty standard analog connection. I have a composite cable but I'm not sure if it's gonna work with the old monitor I have. Speaking of the old monitor. There we go, this bad boy right here. Look at that, alright. So I don't have the composite cable that came with it but I have a composite cable not sure if it's gonna work. But you know what, we're never gonna know if we don't just freaking do it. Let's find out together. Man, the power cable on this monitor is just coated in dust. It's may not look too bad but you can just feel it. It's like, ugh, you can just feel the caked on dust. I'm gonna be sick. Alright we got the monitor plugged in. Now I'm gonna try my composite cable idea. Could totally fail. Okay, well Krazy Ken just have a little confidence. Sure it's not the cable that came with it but it's analog it's not like it really changed much. Okay we're all plugged in, let's have a look. Ooh, I hear a ring. I hear an electric ring, so this thing is turning on. Oh shit, look at that. Well I'll be. Whatever that means, I mean I am be. I always am being. That is delightful, look at that monochrome. Wow, the KoalaPad's not gonna be able to show color but whatever. Boot it up. This is amazing, it's working. It just worked on the first try and this stuff was made in the late 80s and it probably hasn't been turned on in over 10 years. Probably over 20 years, and it just worked. First try. Oh boy, let not touch that dial. Don't touch that dial, you'll (beep) everything up. Success, we just need to get the Unidisk hooked up along with the KoalaPad. So let's shut it down. (clicking) - [Ken] And I know I have the Unidisk somewhere. Gonna have to find that. Okay so just a tiny little problem and by tiny problem I mean catastrophic and now the whole project is gonna be halted. I recycled the Unidisk. Yeah I'm an idiot. I had two of them and I recycled one of them. I thought, whatever I have a second one. I just remembered back in 2008, I made a stupid video where I dissembled it with a friend. And never reassembled it. So that one was already recycled when I thought I had it as a back up. I had two, they both got recycled. Shit. Okay, I'm gonna have to hit up Shmebay. And see what I can find, 'cause we have no way to put a disk in here. The thing is I seriously looked for like an hour before realizing this. It was kinda, or maybe like a half hour. It was kind of a waste of time, and the insulting thing was I found two floppy disks and some other cool Apple peripherals which are nice, so I guess, hey it's not all loss. But yeah I found two disks, and no disk drive. That's just a sucker punch to the gonads. Okay, off to Shmebay. Here we go, let's find one. You know the expression, \"Your Network is your net worth\" Well, that was proven once again. I am very grateful to be surrounded by a community of techies, because whenever I need a five and quarter inch Unidisk drive, you just call someone up on the old telephone and they'll give it to you. Shout out to Christian for donating this for today's experiment. And we have our software now that we can actually load into the computer now that we have the disk drive. And I noticed it was kind of interesting, the stuff on the back it's like safety precautions for your, not your floppy disk, but for your flexible disk. Interesting, alright let's boot this sucker up. Monitor power up. KoalaWare jacket with our KoalaPainter flexible disk. Kinda doing this without seeing too well. There we go and the satisfying little click there. It's not much of a click, it's more of a clunk. And finally power with a nice little beep sound. I love that beep. Here we go. (clicking and beeping) - [Ken] Well we had something show up on the screen, I couldn't really read it from my point of view, but there we are KoalaPainter in monochrome. Now's a good time to get the actual hardware set up. Now I've been lied to before about hot plugging things. Some people say, \"oh you shouldn't hot plug ADB devices\" and then some people are like, \"Oh, that's just a myth\", so I really don't know who to trust anymore, but good job, you have put me into constant state of paranoia, YouTube commenters, so I really appreciate that. So I can't trust myself with plugging this thing in while the computer is on. One weird thing about this, it's almost like snake skin sort of thing going on here. Like this styrofoam, that white stuff in the middle, the styrofoam from the packaging is like permanently stuck on it. It looks kind of like a a snake skin or something. So yeah, since I can't trust anyone anymore, I'm gonna power this thing down, then plug in the graphics tablet to the joystick port. No screws necessary. Kinda cool. Stylus, there we go. Who wants a stylus? Boot her up. (clicking and beeping) - [Ken] Ah, such a pleasant sound. Alright, so probably can't do anything right there. I guess. Let's see how this works. Oh, okay, so the buttons are working. Oh, there we go, we got a crosshair. Storage, mirror, magnify. Don't really know how to control this. Arrow keys don't let me make a selection. So let's see do I click on, (beeping) - [Ken] Oh, there we go. We got beeps. Okay so I think I know what's going on here. Let's go here, I'm gonna move, I'm gonna move this a little closer to me. So I can sign my name with my credit card. There we go, you gotta press and hold down the button to draw. Oh my gosh, this is gonna be, Oh I don't know what I just did there. It like drew a straight line. Oh what the? Okay well we kinda got something going on. I'm trying to figure out this interface though. Wow this is really fidgety. (clicking) - [Ken] So I can draw a box now? Hey, look at that, I drew a box. Shit, and it filled in my box. That is the sexiest box I ever did see. Pretty cool, alright well that's impressive. Alright let's get out of there. I wanna see what's in the storage area, let's see if we can save our stuff anywhere. Oh, it's accessing the disk. Okay, KoalaPainter by Island Graphics. Storage Catalog disc, disk file utilities, load standard DOS 3.3 picture, save standard DOS 3.3 pictures. So we can save and load, alright. Insert target disk. So I'm guessing we can't save onto this diskette, because it's probably read only. But I don't have another Unidisk, or a blank floppy to save to, so we're just gonna have to do all this in the computer's memory for now. So let's get out of here. Alright, lift stylus press button for picture and menu. Okay so, when you're not drawing and you press any of the buttons that's what switches between the menu and the picture. So I think I'm getting the getting the grasp of this a little bit. Let's just erase the whole thing. Select color to erase picture. Okay, Did I just fill the picture? Oh, eh well, that's beautiful. B1 is that black one? I don't know, let's do that. There we go, alright so let's start over. See if we can draw something here. Now I'm not the greatest illustrator, but if I can figure some of this out, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna find a professional graphic illustrator, put them on this computer and see what they can draw. Let's see all of their skills go to waste on 80s technology. (laughing) - [Ken] Oh shit, I'm so evil, even my goosebumps have goosebumps. Okay so palm blocking isn't 100% functioning here, it actually did pick up my finger it seems. I'm using my finger right now and it's triggering it little bit. So let's try to not do that. Let's try to draw something. Yeah, you just gotta push kinda hard otherwise you get little gaps. Let's do the Mac Picasso face. And give him a nice smile. A nice crooked smile. Well hey we got something. Let me sign this for ya. I just did a menu. Okay hang on. There let's sign this. So hold it down, Oh if you tap on the other side of the tablet, it jumps the cursor, okay. I'm learning stuff. There we go. I signed my name, this gonna be a treat. I can not wait to torture a graphic illustrator with this program. Let's black this thing out again. Let's try something different. Let's try the old hello from the old Macintosh. (chiming) (pencil scraping on a tablet) - [Ken] Kind of? I mean it's not, that's not terrible. It could probably be neater. But hey, give me a break, this is the first time I'm using this thing. On a real graphics tablet, like one from this millennium, I can draw better. Magnify, okay. Oh shit. We, oh, hello, ha, literally. That's pretty cool man we can just like pan and zoom around our, Oh, Oh and you can lay, Oh shit, you can lay pixel by pixel. Individual pixels here, you can really be precise with this. There we go. (pencil scraping on a tablet) - [Ken] Yeah, you gotta push kind hard, Otherwise it kinda, yep. Well now it's anime mouth. You know they always have like a gap right there or something. But yeah, that's not too bad, man. It's, for what it is and year it's from, that's impressive. We can be like a doctor, be like, \"Hey here's your EKG\" That's probably not a very healthy one. I don't know what I'm doing but There you go, your patient is healthy. And we determine that with our KoalaWare KoalaPaint software Well let's try some disks. Ooh, aww nice I love that animation right there, that's pretty cool. Let's get another circle here. Or a disk, excuse me. Hey, we got something going on. Okay lets go back to the menu. We got something going on. Let's get a brush. Yeah, that right there, that is art. We'll draw, Some pupils. There we go, it's coming along. Well on this device that's probably the best I can do. Now I'm gonna track down that graphic illustrator. And I'm gonna torture her with this machine. And while I track down the artist, I must conserve power, which scientifically I don't think is 100% possible. But you know what I mean. Sorry face, nothing personal. Alright ladies and germs, so I found that graphical illustrator I was talking about earlier. Everyone say hi to Heidi. Thank you, that was very nice of you. (laughing) - [Ken] What do you, so what do you normally draw on? What's your like go to device for drawing? - [Heidi] Well, I really just love drawing on like just regular paper. - [Ken] Ahh, that's the way to do it. You don't have battery life, you don't have to worry about saving, it's very nice. - [Heidi] Yeah I like sketching with just regular pencils and blue pencils and red pencils. - [Ken] Oh yeah. - [Heidi] And then just going in with a classic ink. I like brush pens and stuff, but lately I've been using, can I show this on here? - [Ken] Yeah, show me that thing man, that thing is huge. - [Heidi] Lately I've been using this awesome iPad. - [Ken] So this is what you're gonna be drawing on today. How does that make you feel? - [Heidi] Well I saw it earlier, and I was like, oh, that looks or cool. - [Ken] Yes, oh my gosh, okay so there's no screen on it, you're just gonna kinda be doing it, - [Heidi] Yeah. - [Ken] Kinda blind. And, can you reach me that stylus right there? - [Heidi] Yes. - [Ken] Yeah. So let's see we have the KoalaPad stylus as it says on there, Why don't you take ahold of that. This probably actually feels more like a pencil than like today's modern styluses do. - [Heidi] Yeah and it's a lot lighter than the Apple Pencil that I got with my iPad here. - [Ken] Yeah. - [Heidi] That one is like freakishly heavy. - [Ken] So what we're gonna do, - [Heidi] Yes. - [Ken] Is I'm gonna hook you up with this guy, and you're gonna be drawing a picture. Now I hope you like green, I hope you like green, 'cause that's the only color you've got. - [Heidi] Well green is good, it's close to my favorite color, blue. - [Ken] Alright, so let's hook this up and give it shot, What do you say? - [Heidi] Awesome. - [Ken] Alright let's do it. Alright so you're all cozy down there, ready to make some artistic magic. - [Heidi] Mmmhmm. - [Ken] Alright, so we're gonna boot this sucker up. (clicking) - [Ken] That crunching sound is normal by the way. That's a floppy disk for ya. - [Heidi] Okie Dokie. - [Ken] Let's take a look at what we got on the screen. Once it warms up. I hope I plugged this in right. There it is. It's doing absolutely nothing, that's a good sign. (laughing) - [Ken] Good, we're off to a good start. Can you press the reset button for me right there? - [Heidi] The right one? - [Ken] Ah no, this one right here. - [Heidi] Oh, I'm so sorry. - [Ken] I want you to contribute to this. (laughing) - [Ken] There we go, see if that works. There we go. So here's your software. - [Heidi] Ooh, nice - [Ken] Oh yeah, so I gotta actually see what's going on so I can guide you. So yeah, press return on the keyboard there. - [Heidi] Of course. - [Ken] So this is the menu. You choose like what shape you wanna draw, what colors you wanna draw with. You see that little crosshair that shows up? - [Heidi] Oh yeah. - [Ken] So you can use that to select like, your colors down here and stuff like that, and you just use this like a mouse. Like that's your click. So like if you were to click on, - [Heidi] Like, - [Ken] Yeah like, those are you brush sizes, yeah. So if you click on it watch what happens. See how it changes there? - [Heidi] Oh yeah like it selected it. - [Ken] Any time you wanna get to your canvas, you just lift the stylus and click. - [Heidi] Just? - [Ken] Yup. - [Heidi] This one? - [Ken] The way you actually draw, is you gotta hold down the button. - [Heidi] I had a feeling it was gonna be something like that. - [Ken] Have fun. - [Heidi] Oh okay, I figured something out here. Wee. So if I we're to lift the stylus, and we got the right brush, - [Ken] Nice - [Heidi] Okay. Now I, wait. - [Ken] Make magic happen. - [Heidi] Alright. Okay. (laughing) - [Ken] It's a bowling ball, yes. (laughing) - [Heidi] Oh my goodness. Maybe I should retry this. - [Ken] No it's okay. - [Heidi] Oh fudge. (laughter) - [Heidi] Oh my goodness, what am I on now? Whoa, sweet. - [Ken] Your on mirror mode I guess. - [Heidi] Did you know this was on here? - [Ken] I knew it was on there but I never tried it. - [Heidi] Wee. - [Ken] Whoa. That's actually really trippy. - [Heidi] Okay should I just go back to, - [Ken] You had mirror selected, yeah. Oh dude, this feels really mathematical. (laughing) - [Heidi] Mathematical. - [Ken] Oh my gosh, that is beautiful. - [Heidi] Sorry. - [Ken] Shit. - [Heidi] I don't know if this is gonna look anything like, but then you, I don't have room for his ears. (laughter) - [Heidi] Ah. - [Ken] Oh. - [Heidi] Whoa - [Ken] Whoa. - [Heidi] It like jumped around. - [Ken] Something happened there. You can draw with the smaller brush. - [Heidi] Oh, that would probably be nice. - [Ken] Yeah. - [Heidi] Command Z, Control Z. - [Ken] I wish. (laughter) - [Ken] I love it. You gotta remember to -- - [Heidi] Oh my god. - [Ken] Oh no, it did it again. - [Heidi] I was just trying to fill in the, oh no, oh yeah, it likes to jump around. - [Ken] Oh boy. The body's looking, oh. - [Heidi] Whoa, I did not do that. It just went, wee. - [Ken] I spoke too soon. I was like the body looks great. (laughing) - [Ken] I don't know guys I think the new Firestarter looks really good. - [Heidi] I'm trying to shade it. - [Ken] Oh my, oh my god you're-- - [Heidi] It's hot working. - [Ken] It's gonna be hard to shade on a one bit monochrome display but I know it's possible. - [Heidi] I thought it couldn't hurt to try. (laughing) - [Heidi] Oh my gosh. - [Ken] Oh no. - [Heidi] That was the worst so far, I'm done. - [Ken] Oh look at that, it's pretty awesome. - [Heidi] Um, should I try to draw a squirrel? - [Ken] Squirrels are cool. - [Heidi] What if I try to draw really fast? - [Ken] It probably won't work. I tried it, but you can certainly try it. Yeah, see? - [Heidi] Whoa, okay yeah. - [Ken] Yup, time to wipe that out. - [Heidi] Slow and steady wins the race. - [Ken] Yeah, you gotta go like really slow with this thing. - [Heidi] This is looking more like a bird than, Maybe I should just make it a bird. - [Ken] Maybe. - [Heidi] It want's to be a bird. - [Ken] It wants to be a bird. - [Heidi] Screw the squirrel. This is a bird. (laughter) - [Heidi] You can actually tell it's a bird. - [Ken] Oh my gosh this is the - [Heidi] Oh! - [Ken] Oh He's got a big talon. - [Heidi] He's a little deformed, that's okay. He's still beautiful. - [Ken] Is that a sun? - [Heidi] Yes. - [Ken] Yay. Let's Bob Ross this thing and out some happy trees in there. - [Heidi] Mmmhmm. Should I try to draw like an anime character or something? - [Ken] Go for it. - [Heidi] I don't know. - [Ken] Maybe you should like do it, and like I'll try to figure out what it is before you finish - [Heidi] Oh okay. Alright, then I won't tell you who he is. Or she - [Ken] Oh, or she, alright. Hatsune Miku! (laughter) - [Heidi] No. - [Ken] Just a guess. Pretty good. - [Heidi] Ooh, I don't know if I have enough room. - [Ken] Oh no. - [Heidi] That's okay. - [Ken] If only we knew how the scale tool worked. - [Heidi] Could zoom out. Now this was one of my favorite anime. When I was a kid. - [Ken] Oh yeah? - [Heidi] It actually kid got me into anime. - [Ken] So while she's working on that, I just wanted to take the time to thank the awesome viewer that donated this tablet. Dasheill, thank you so much, and his former instructor, Mr. Staley, I believe he got it from an old university he used to go to. And again Christian, thank you for donating the Unidisk, because without that, we couldn't actually run the software. - [Heidi] Yeah, I tried to write his name right there. I had to split into two parts, and the, this letter here, wanted to do it's own thing. Looks exactly like him. (laughing) The shape of the eyebrows kinda right. - [Ken] That's not too bad. - [Heidi] They're a little thicker but - [Ken] That's not too bad at all. - [Heidi] I tried to write, Inuyasha.

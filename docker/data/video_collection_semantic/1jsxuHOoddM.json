    "transcript": "- Like I- - Ha, whoa, whoa! Hot take alert. Whoo, you could drop that on at the very end of the video. - Hello, and welcome to This Is. The iPhone has been unlocked, unleashed. They're cracked out of their jorts and they're on the bean. - So this is an emergency episode because there has been absolute breaking news. The iPhone, famously the most restrictive of the major smartphone platforms is getting cracked wide open by our friends in the good old European Union. Now I'm gonna do my best to offend the smallest amount of Europeans in this video possible. So, hello. Greetings - Guten tag. - Bonjour. - Hello - That's Australia. - Wait. - The story here is really, really large. Now the European Union has been working to, let's say, reform Apple and the iPhone for a while. They're a huge driver. And why it's pretty much a lock that the iPhone in 2023 will be using USB-C instead of Lightning because there's trying to standardize that across the - For the record, I still don't think that's actually gonna happen because of some weird legal mumbo jumbo but sure. - But now it is almost the biggest change to the iPhone since the iPhone app store was announced. A couple caveats here before we dive into all the, the specifics. This is not officially confirmed yet but this was run by Mark Gurman at Bloomberg who has an exemplary track record. And it does make sense because the European have basically been trying to tell Apple, Hey, fix your shit or however you say it in kind European words like hello sir, we would like you to change the operations of your operating system to better comply with regulations. - So basically what the EU said is you have to open up the app store to allow third party and more importantly, side loading app - Which is almost what jail breaking has been since the beginning, right? Obviously jail breaking is a lot less popular than it was but back in the earlier days the app store was wildly restrictive, right? You could only do so many things. The quality level was so high they always wanted the 30%. - The restrictions were really high in the beginning. And that was a good thing because it meant like we got really dumb apps in the beginning. - iBeer. - There was a level of quality like, and I don't mean like app quality, I mean like performance quality. They weren't crashing. - There were so many restrictions, right? So in the early days, it's easy to forget there was a rule that you could not release an app on the app store if it duplicated a system function. You couldn't do like other mail apps and calendar apps and photo apps like today. Obviously some things have changed in regards to that. But still, if you are the creator of an app, Mr. Musk, you are at the mercy of Apple. If you want to keep that app on the app store, if you wanna release an update that doesn't abide by one of the very many Iowa standards, they can just boot you straight off. They're judge, jury and executioner. Whereas for pretty much every other platform out there Windows, you've got Androids, you've got Mac OS you can download and do whatever you want like you own your device and you can download apps from anywhere you want and you can use them in however you want. Now, even with these new changes, which we're gonna continue to detail, cause there's a lot of stuff here that is going to be changing very shortly. They are still going to want their percentage which is nebulous because if I'm side loading an app how is Apple gonna try to get 30% when I side load something? - I have thoughts on that. Like, so right now the developer tools for Apple is free. Anyone can download them. And I think if this goes through, you're gonna have to start paying a licensing fee to have access to - To develop - Xcode. - Well, they also could only allow signed apps that are - Yeah. - Like even if you're downloading an app that was not from the app store, it still has to be signed by Apple rather to run on it. - Say there's a new phone that comes out and say, you know it's the Matt phone. And I wanted, and I'm wildly successful because why wouldn't I be, and I have the Matt store and I wanna charge 40%. I would be affected by this regulatory thing. - What this will look like is gonna take a number of different sort of paths. So first and foremost, in 2024 European iPhones and it is important to mention that this is meant to be a European only thing. So iPhones sold outside of Europe will theoretically not be open to this degree. Although how they will police that, I have no idea. - There's no way to. You hop on a VPN and oh, suddenly I'm across the world. - Don't do the accent. Don't do the accent. - I'm not doing an accent. - You were, you were about to do the accent. - Oh no, there's no way to police this. So like the same way of like, technically only iPhones in Europe are gonna need to use USB-C. They're just make it all. - Yeah, of course. - Like why, why not? - There are some big pros to this opening up the app store. - Emulators could be actually properly available on iPhones. - We could talk about like cloud gaming. - Yes. - Like the reason that Microsoft does not have a proper cloud gaming app on, on iOS right now is because of the super restrictive way that they handle this. So the way that Microsoft would have to put X Cloud or Game Pass onto iOS properly is they would have to have every one of the games that's available on Game Pass which is a lot by the way individually compatible and approved by the app store. - Because they wanna treat it as its own individual game, right? - Which is just not feasible. And it's also defeats the purpose of cloud gaming. - Absolutely. This is an exact perfect example of why the Byzantine App Store rules can mean that entire industries are just simply not either able to make it work on the iPhone or it is so difficult on diff, like almost impossible to deal with, right? And you look at lots of companies who would like to charge. So say you're Netflix, say you're Hulu, you're Spotify, maybe you're Twitter trying to charge for Twitter Blue. Well right now, if you want to charge someone through the app, you need to give Apple 30%. And if you're Hulu, you can't just give Apple 30%, right? Like so you almost have to artificially raise the price to cover Apple's cut because you need the $8 or whatever to pay all your shareholders or whatever. - We've seen that a little bit of like say sign up for a new subscription somewhere or say, all right, well if you sign up for it on desktop, it's seven bucks a month - They can't tell you that in the app, they go sign into your account that you've definitely made on another device. - Like it's gonna be $9 if you sign up through Apple because they're trying to get their $7 profit. - To be fair, this, while I think is honestly probably one of the bigger problems with the App store is likely not going to change because I bet you that if Apple is still wanting their 30% on things that are like side loaded and whatnot you better believe that Netflix is not just gonna sneak an update like Fortnite did where they're like, Hey, guess what? You don't have to use the app store anymore. But the thing that goes beyond just the pure apps you look at what has happened to Android. Now I will say Android has had this forever. You've always been able to side load an additional stores. You've always been able to side load additional apps which is why the Amazon app store exists. Which is why the Fortnite launcher exists. Because let's not forget that that was a whole split with both Google and Apple. It's just Apple feels like they kind of took more of the the brunt of things. This also dovetails into another very interesting concept. If you take a step to the other major regulatory news Microsoft have talked about why they think the Activision Blizzard acquisition should be approved is that they want to be able to create meaningful competition in the mobile space and create their own app store where they could sell apps and games and whatnot. - Sure. - Without having to give money to Apple. Well guess what? If Apple are forced to allow side loading of not only the Amazon app store and whatever, but also the Microsoft app store and they're able to do their kind of own thing, that's a super interesting idea. - Theoretically Microsoft can have you side load the app store the same way you used to side load the Google Play store onto like a Amazon fire device. - Exactly. - So like not only is it side loading the app but you're side loading an entire store. This is for the most part good for everyone. For the most part. - What about Apple? It's good for Apple? - Well, screw Apple. For the most part, this is a good thing. There are some issues with this. Think about these security nightmares of, if it really is as unlocked as people want it to be. - They'll water this down before it comes out. They'll water water it down. - Well, but like there's always like, again, you lose that security of Apples saying, okay, well we're making sure you don't have like just crazy malware. You wanna side load your banking app? - You're living dangerously. - Yeah. Don't side load your banking app. I don't want Tim Cook knowing my banking account. Let me get this banking app off of FileZilla. - Yeah. Wow. It's weird that it needs six different credit cards for me to log in. So weird, okay, do do do. - So you lose that like level of security. - But you don't, it's not like the app store's going away, to be fair. - No. - This is an additional option, which again Android has had forever. I'm just gonna just make a little informal poll. Please let us know in the comments below. Have you ever side loaded an app on Android? And if you have, have you done it once? Have you done it once a year, once a month? I'm really curious because I know for me, I can't remember the last time you needed side load something. But that's also because a lot of the apps that I would want that aren't on the app store such as emulators are actually on the Play Store so - Am I allowed to break some, some sponsor magic? The only time I've side loaded in the past like 10 years. - Oh. - Is if we look like get like a sponsored product that's maybe, maybe not out yet. - Yep. - The company will provide us a like an unreleased - APK. - APK, we side load that, which is very like, very niche. But like you said, I haven't, I haven't had to side load. There's some really good emulators that you could just get on the app store now, like Pizza Boy and stuff like that. When the heyday of side loading these things was like you know, maybe 10 years ago at this point they just weren't on the app stores or they like the ones that were on there were really bad. They were like heavily heavily ad supported and now they're not. And like, so like I'm willing to pay, you know a little bit on the app store to get a polished emulator, which is what I've done in the past. - Absolutely. - So like while this is good - Yes. - I feel like it's not gonna be that big a thing now. - But there is other stuff though Matt. - Yes. - Before you try to sum us up on like what this is about be, well they're not just locking up the app store. Matt, do you know what they're locking up? Tim Cook has the keys to the iPhone fortune and he is unlocked it for lots of fine European. - Expect iMessage. Yeah, they're not, they're specifically not doing that. - The only thing that people actually care about in this scenario is iMessage that's not affected by it. - Okay. Can I hit you with a list? - Yeah, give me a list. - So access to additional web browsing engines which to be fair, unlike pretty much every other device every web browser on iOS is essentially reskinned Safari so you can't actually develop your own web kit or whatever engine for the iPhone. You have to basically take Safari slap some features on it and call it a day. Basically every browser on iOS is Safari with some bits and bobs put on top of it. They'll be unlocking the NFC chip. They'll be allowing other - MagSafe could be opened up for a lot of things where I, what I had said was a cool way to use MagSafe would be in like automobiles, just kind of dock it and then have use the NFC as either your key or as like that that's what transmits the wifi credentials. So like whoop, you connect it. So automakers could do that without paying a massive license fee - Which to be fair NFC is a little bit of a nebulous term because it may not, MagSafe is probably proprietary enough that they can get away with it. - Sure. - But regardless, being able to, like I could develop an app that will allow me to unlock a door without having to go through the app store, whatever, using NFC, the ability for other people to use the Find My Network. So right now, if you want to use the Find My Network which is like used by an air tags and everything like that you're pretty much forced to a buy an air tag or B by a licensed product that has already been included. Well now they basically may force you to like say, hey this has gotta be open. Anyone can create or there has to be some clear rules. - That's one I think like everything should kind of be using the same standard. - That's really simple. And that's really a lot of these things. It is standardizing things, right? - Yeah. - And to be fair, we're talking about this from the Apple lens. I wouldn't be surprised if some of these may apply to some of the stuff on Android. But the thing is Android has always been more open. It's always been more like sort of wide ranging. What this really is, if you wanna boil it down to a single sentence in 2024, at least in Europe the iPhone is going to be much more open like Android. Now, the exact way that they approach that, the pros and cons, I'm sure they're gonna water things down and it's gonna be annoying. You have to do this. - Yeah. - And side loading means you have to like call Tim Cook a really cool dude on the phone. He's like, all right, I'll give you the code. And he like unlocks whatever. Like we don't know exactly the details - And you kind of joke about that. But like I would not be surprised if they just make it so difficult to side load. - Yeah. - Not impossible. - Just like, oh just the hoops you have to jump through. 99% of people abandon it. You know, you'll always have your enthusiasts who will who will wanna do that. But it's all weird. - It's an opening up of the platform. Yeah, right. The iPhone right now is a very locked down platform which there are reasons for that. I'm not saying it's a bad thing that that's an option but basically it's not really an option. It's just the way things are. Essentially what this is, is the first step, in my opinion toward Apple opening up the iPhone to give you the freedom to be a little bit more custom with things to install apps slightly differently. To be able to use more of the hardware on your device for different purposes other than the ones that Apple specifically allowed that can live in the app store. And I think with that sort of box starts to open I don't think it's something that can be closed. I think other people are gonna take advantage of it. And yes, there are security implications, that absolutely is true. But I think by that same token, vast majority of people are not gonna do this. And if you guess what if you side load some sketchy weird app or whatever. I'm sorry to say not my problem, don't do that. Same thing. You don't do that in your PC or whatever. Like you can't like being locked down and limited is not an excuse for security. - No, that is why that is partly why iPhone became popular was because you kind of didn't have to worry about that. Again, these are arguments from 10, 15 years ago. - Yeah. - Where like this was all new, new territory. Where I feel like this is actually gonna come into play in the real world is you go to download Spotify on iPhone and there it won't be on the app store. If you wanna put on your phone you're gonna download and side load it from, you know, through their website. And then they don't have to pay any of the, they don't have to give any of the 30% for your subscription. - So you think it'll be like the Mac app store where some apps are in the Mac app store but most Mac apps are downloaded individually. Is that kind of where you think this is gonna eventually end up? - Again, I think for the most part it's not gonna matter at all. I think it's only gonna be the big players who - People who want the 30% back or have some like, oh my app is not approved for the app store because of of this Byzantine reason or something like that. - Well for the most part, for small developers the app store is still the best way to get your app. - Oh of course. - Noticed at all. That's again, partly why it was so popular and that's why every platform, because again feel like we scream this all the time, Apple is not the only one charging 30% for their apps. There's a reason the app store became so big and so popular and I just, I don't see everyone abandoning it. - No, - I say that not just as users, but like as developers. I'm curious what a developer actually has to say this specifically a smaller one because - What does this enable you to do? - Yeah. - That you couldn't do in the past? Or what does this give you as flexibility? My hope for this is that it injects a little bit of competition more than anything else. If Microsoft and Amazon have app stores on the iPhone where they're competing to give you the best product, that has gotta be a win, right? Where you can still use the app store and you can pretend this never happened and never think about it. And everything continues exactly as it is. Nothing is being taken away from you as an iPhone user. However, if you want to experiment, if you want to dabble if you wanna try other stores if you wanna try other types of apps that have traditional app been approved, guess what? That now can become an option for you in 2024 if you're a European citizen. - What this does open the door for later on is opening up iOS even further with the way that the EU is pushing right now. - Good point. I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility at some point for someone to say you can't lock your software down the way you have. - Standardize, open. - You have to let Samsung use iOS. - Whoa, whoa. Hot take alert. You're gonna drop that on at the very end of the video. - Let us know how crazy I am. Like, subscribe, follow. What do you think about this? - I'm not gonna lie, I'd probably buy a z flip if it ran to iOS. - Just I would, 100% would.",

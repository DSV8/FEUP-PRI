    "transcript": "- Oh, look at that, he's so fine. (singing) So you ran into my former fiance. - Hello. - (singing) So I saw him dancing last night. You're not recording it. Don't do that. - [Cameraman] No, I'm not (beep) - Today's video is sponsored by Anker. They have a holiday giveaway goin' on with over 1300 prizes. For your chance to win, make sure you guys hit the link below. Here guys. Jonathan here and we are back with the best tech under 50, just in time for the holidays. Got a special guest, my friend Theresa. - Hi, how are you? - Do you like French bulldogs? - Yes I do. - Do you like bluetooth speakers? - Yes, I do. - Then get excited because we got the Aerobull French Blue Dog. - [Off Camera] Blue dog? - French Bull Dog bluetooth speaker. Now I think my favorite thing about this has gotta be the window sound. (beep) (static) (bongos) (xylophone) There we go. (chuckles) You ever use Windows XP? - Yes I do, all the time. - [Computer] Confirmed. (heavy rock music) - Can I ask you what song would you like to hear? - How about Bruno Mars, Uptown? - You're gonna get me demonitized. - I would've never known that was a speaker. - Quality. Say my name, you know who I am - Fabulous. Hot damn Wanna make you get up, honey. Break it down. And go. (claps) Girls hit you hallelujah Ow. Girls hit you hallelujah Ow. Girls hit you -- I'm gonna get it. Don't believe me just watch (clapping) - Youtube.com/tld, Subscribe now. - Tld, they don't know. - Tom Larry David. - Theme park, remember. - So if that doesn't sell you, I'm not sure what else would. If you need some French Bull Dog bluetooth speaker fun in your life like Theresa, check out the link below. So next up are the Anker SoundBuds Lite, which are wireless headphones that are not only under $50 bucks, right now they are under 30 and are perfect for anyone looking for a pair of active headphones. Now when I say active, I mean people who are looking to take these on a walk, on a run, working out at the gym, riding a bike. They're lightweight and they're also water resistant. So if you sweat a lot, you're not gonna have to worry about wrecking these. Now if you're someone out there who gets crazy, gets jacked, like Austin has at the gym, has a tendency to knock off their headphones or their earbuds. This neckband is gonna help ensure they don't fall off your neck. Speaking of the devil. I was talking about getting jacked at the gym, like this man. He needs some Soundbuds Lite in his life. - Do I? - Yes. - [Cameraman] And give him some macho beans. - Nope. - [Cameraman] Or some mache beans. - That's a well dressed man right there. Bye Evans. What's a nice little touch with these though is the ear buds themselves. They have magnetic tips so if you touch them together like Tim Cook and Bono, they're gonna connect and that's gonna be really useful when you have these stored away in your bag. Now as far as sound quality, these aren't gonna blow your mind, but again the big thing to remember is these are under $30 bucks. With that said, they sound way better than you expect for that price. You get a decent amount of low end, the isolation is really solid. But again the big selling point with these is one, that neckband's gonna keep these on your head, two, they're water resistant. So not only do you not worry about sweating, you can take these in the sauna and last but not least, these things are $25 bucks. So they are super affordable. So next up, this USB drive is kind of genius. It almost looks like this ninja star type thing, but what it is is this Swiss Army knife of USB drives. It has every connector you could possibly need. So of course you have your standard USB A connector, but you also have micro USB, USB C and then lightening. But what's cool with that is that it's also MFI certified. So this is kind of an awesome way to transfer files between any kind of device, whether it's Windows, Android, MAC, IOS or even Linux. It's also kind of the perfect tech gift if you're not sure which phone they use or which computer they have because the beautiful thing about this is that it's gonna work with pretty much whatever they have. Now the one potential down side with this is the speeds on this aren't crazy fast. But again, with a 32 gigabyte capacity, your more likely not to be transferring giant files back and forth. And more importantly, at the price point $35 bucks, this thing is awesome. So next, with more and more smart phone supporting wireless charging, the need and want for wireless charging tech has definitely gone up. This is a dual wireless charging pad from YOLIKE and it's kind of an awesome deal. It comes in under $30 bucks, which is honestly cheaper than most single charging pads out there now. Now what's kind of an added bonus with this is that it comes with a power adapter in the box. And with most wireless chargers, you have to buy that separately. So with that factored in, that makes that $30 dollar price point really freaking good. So if you have a household with multiple smartphones that support wireless charging, this is kind of a must have. Plus because you're getting 2 in 1, that's gonna help minimize cables and keep things nice and clean. Whether you throw this on your desk, next to your bed, in the kitchen, it's very simple and very minimal. So it's gonna look good no matter what. And again, for the price, you cannot go wrong. So next up, powerstrips are definitely not the most exciting thing on the planet, but this thing is freaking cool. Now honestly, aside from that crazy French Bull Dog bluetooth speaker, this episode almost could've been called the best tech under $35 bucks because this is also on sale for just under $32 dollars. See you have four USB ports for charging which is awesome, but those four outlets you get are not only Amazon Echo compatible, they also work with Google Home, which is crazy cool. So why I think it's kind of an awesome deal is I've seen single smart outlets that cost more than this alone. So why you may potentially want a smart outlet or outlets in your home is simple. It gives you control over non smart items. Whether it's a lamp without a smart lightbulb, your Christmas tree, your coffeemaker, this gives you control. Not only with your smartphone, but also with your voice. Speaking of Google Home and Amazon Alexa, I believe you can still scoop up an Echo Dot and Google Home Mini for under $50 bucks right now. So we'll link those along with everything I talked about down below. Aside from that, thank you guys so much for watching. Hopefully you enjoyed the video. If you did and you feel like being awesome, make sure to go Dancing Theresa on that Like button and she was amazing. We gotta hang out again. This is Jonathan and I will catch you guys later. (beep) - Hi, how are you? Welcome to this demonstration of this wonderful speaker. Anybody that's a dug, dog lover would really appreciate it. The artistic creation is -- (coughing) wonderful. - I'm sorry, I lost it. (coughing) I screwed you up. I screwed you up. (laughing) (coughing)",

    "transcript": "It is time to end the series on Laserdisc. I know, I know, its tragic, but Ive been putting it off and and its long overdue. Many new subscribers have perhaps not seen any of my Laserdisc series, and Ill place a link to the playlist down below. As the fastest recap possible, Laserdiscs were the first optical disc format, predating the CD by four years, and they held up to an hour of excellent quality video--nearly that of DVD--with CD quality digital sound. They never achieved great success in the US or really all of Europe due to the high cost of the system and the inability to record television shows on them, but in Japan they were pretty successful reaching about a 10% market penetration. Id also like to just throw in here because I keep forgetting to do so, Im on Twitter now @TechConnectify. Thats only the second time Ive mentioned that and Ive had it for two months now. Im really good at this! Now, this final video on the format goes over three things: One, the discs popularity in karaoke, two the Japan-only Squeeze LD format and Three, the MUSE high definition Laserdisc. Well start with that because thats whats the title and thumbnail said. Japan, being Japan, was way ahead of the rest of the world when it came to high definition television. As an American, I think of HD as being a product of the early 2000s, especially with the introduction of Blu-Ray and HD-DVD in 2006 providing the first form of high definition home video. That is of course only if you dont count the first D-Theater D-VHS releases from 2002. And I am aware that the first HD broadcast in the US took place in 1996, but adoption didnt really take off until 2004-2005. But in Japan, a new analog High Definition standard began test broadcasts in 1989 via satellite, and it was in development as far back as 1979. This standard was called MUSE, which was a sloppy acronym for Multiple sub-Nyquist Sampling Encoding. NHK, the national broadcasting company in Japan, preferred the name Hi-Vision. The actual specifics of MUSE are very very complicated and involve some strange sampling techniques to increase the resolution that go way over my head. Apparently its not strictly analog but also includes some digital sampling that is limited by movement within the frame and its just real weird so please visit some of the links down below if youd like to learn more. But in simple terms, MUSE produced a video source nearly equivalent to todays 1080i resolution. With 1,125 lines transmitted, of which 1035 were visible, you could call the resolution 1035i. And similar to NTSC, it used a 60 hz refresh rate. To get the MUSE signal on a Laserdisc required tweaking the format somewhat. The most significant twist was the adoption of a red laser. If you thought DVD was the first format to use the red laser, think again. Just as the pits in a DVD are smaller and allow for more data on the disc compared to a CD, the smaller pits of MUSE laserdiscs allowed for a higher bandwidth analog signal than a conventional Laserdisc. Hi-Vision Laserdiscs used the same CAV and CLV flavors of your standard discs, but due to a higher linear speed required--apparently the pits were still the same length, just squished closer together-- CAV discs used a smaller portion of the disc, with the inner radius being pushed out 76 millimeters. And CLV discs used the entire face of the disc, but the inner portion was read at 2,700 RPM. My word. That is ridiculous. OK, just as a reminder, these discs weigh a tad over 200g, or just under half a pound. And a consumer piece of A/V equipment would get this massive disc spinning at 2,700 RPM. If the disc were rolling, it would be travelling at 152.6 kilometers per hour, or about 95 miles per hour. In your living room. For more context into this absurdity, a standard Laserdisc spins at up to 1,800 RPM and already that seems too fast for comfort. Just listen to this player spin a disc up. [loud, building whirring noise, with a bassy vibration] To be fair, this old beast is louder than newer players, but newer players are still plenty frightening when their covers are off. [mechanical sounds as transport engages with disc] [Slightly less loud whirring noise, but still at unsettling speeds] Now imagine that 50% faster. Yikes. Anyway, even though Japan was early for HD, and MUSE Laserdisc was among the earliest ways to get HD content, it was the Laserdisc of Laserdiscs. Adoption was very poor, and the players were mighty expensive. Plus, they required a separate MUSE decoder to actually create a component output to send to your TV. But still, near 1080i video on a disc in the mid nineties? Thats pretty wild. Today, these MUSE Laserdisc players are highly sought after for numerous reasons. First is probably their collectability and relative rarity. And trust me, they arent common. As I write this, on eBay theres a player with an asking price of $1800, and someone else wants nearly $4000 for theirs. Discs are also hideously expensive, commanding $300 or more. But aside from their novelty, they are among the best laserdisc players available. These players used their red laser to read standard NTSC laserdiscs too, and the shorter wavelength of the laser means it could read discs more easily. Scratched and worn discs play better on a MUSE machine. Really, all discs play better on MUSE machines because the red laser almost entirely eliminates crosstalk, and its more advanced electronics produce a better output. Moving on then, for those that arent already aware, karaoke is a BIG deal in many parts of Asia. Much of Laserdiscs success came from Asia at large, and some of this was due to its seemingly perfect alignment with the karaoke business. Karaoke, after all, began in Japan. Pioneer was involved in the karaoke business to a surprising degree, apparently producing many of the music videos used in karaoke machines. Which, of course, were made very flexible with the use of Laserdiscs. Pioneer made various models of Laserdisc jukeboxes that could hold 50 or more discs. These machines, with catalogs of up to 100 hours of material available all in one place, helped make Laserdisc the format of choice for karaoke machines. To be clear, though, there were and are many different types of karaoke venue; those that would have one of the Laserdisc jukeboxes were probably in a small percentage of the total. Still, laserdisc as a format was used fairly widely. Now, if you werent aware, a large innovation in Karaoke was the development of the CD+G format, thats compact disc-graphics. Using the rarely-used subcode channels of an audio CD, the CD+G was able to store basic graphics (16 colors at a resolution of 300 X 216) alongside the audio. Karaoke machines displayed these graphics, which were usually lyrics, while playing a disc. Laserdisc received a similar extension. The LD-G addition wasnt quite as impressive, though. Info on its specifics is sparse, but it appears it was more along the lines of a closed-captioning system, with white text on black boxes resembling the standard line 21 decoding we have here in the States. The actual data was hidden in the audio stream. While it wasnt as impressive as CD-Graphics... its a Laserdisc so it has full motion video going on already. Plus, the LD-G standard supported 16 different data streams, so multiple languages of lyrics or subtitles could be supported. Whether or not LD-G made its way into karaoke is unclear, but its still pretty neat. Well, it seems as though this final installment will be pretty short. I suppose it is pretty much a heres three other things we havent talked about Laserdisc yet! episode. Hmm. Well anyway, the third and final thing is what we are going to refer to as Squeeze LD because thats what its called. Just as DVD can store the video on discs anamorphically, whereby the image is squeezed in from side to side, Laserdisc could do it too! But only in Japan. And only sometimes. So as a refresher, the reason why this is a good idea is that for widescreen displays, it really helps if the content going to them is also widescreen. We could create a new 16:9 video standard, but sending a 16:9 signal to a 4:3 display might get messy. What we want is something that would be compatible with both. Anamorphic widescreen is a way to use the existing 4:3 video standard for widescreen in a non-destructive way. In a DVD, if the disc is made using anamorphic widescreen, the actual video looks like this. If this signal is going to a widescreen display, A DVD player will send this as is, and the TV will stretch that image out to fill itself in. If you dont have a widescreen TV, then the DVD player will squish the image downward and add letterboxes to the top and bottom to restore the correct aspect ratio. Of course you can encode the video with the letterboxing, but then youre wasting much of the resolution on black bars. This means to fill a widescreen display, you have to zoom it in. And if you make these chunks go offscreen, youre making all of that resolution just go away. By using anamorphic widescreen, none of the image is lost, it just becomes stretched. To use digital terms, it takes pixels that should be square and stretches them sideways into rectangles. But of course Laserdisc isnt digital so there arent pixels. Lets not go down that path Squeeze LD was perhaps the first time anamorphic widescreen was found in home video. But it was rare for players to be able to unsqueeze the image--few Laserdisc players had the ability to self-letterbox like any DVD player can. So unless you had a 16:9 television, which was a rare thing even in Japan while Laserdisc was still current, a Squeeze LD would actually really suck. As you can imagine they arent particularly common, and they were never released in the States. Well, that about covers it. I think we said all there is to say about Laserdisc. Except no! Theres one more thing! A bonus fact! There WERE recordable Laserdiscs! And in at least three varieties. Just like the CD-R is a thing, so was the LD-R. Except they were really called RLV for Recordable Laser Videodisc. Now, Wikipedia tells us with no accompanying citation that these were developed and marketed by the Optical Disc Corporation in 1984. Ive linked some forum threads down below which shed some light on the issue, and it could be that fewer than 10 machines ever existed which could write to these RLVs. But, once written, they were compatible with standard Laserdisc players, just as a CD-R is with any old CD player. Usually. The second variety was actually re-writable. The Pioneer VDR-V1000 was a behemoth of a machine, equipped with 2 lasers to enable reading in one place while writing in another, and the caddy-protected discs had a theoretical lifespan of one million re-writes. But, this thing was definitely for professional use only, with a retail price of 25,000. Discs, though, were quite the bargain at only 800. Sony developed a third, almost unrelated writable video standard called CRV, which rather than being a midsize crossover... I mean a re-writable disc, was a write-once read-many format, but it only held 24 minutes per side. It was mainly used as a video backup system in the professional market. Interesting, CRV stands for Component Recordable Video disc, which makes me wonder if it stored component signals rather than composite. Perhaps that would explain its reduced runtime. There might have been more recordable versions of Laserdisc out there, but information on them is scarce. A lot of info for this video came from forum threads on the Laserdisc archive, the Laserdisc Database, and even CED magic. Ive put some links down below if youd like to take a look at these conversations. I believe I owe particular thanks to Disclord for his knowledge. Well now, that is all I have to say about Laserdisc. Im sure well look at it again in some fashion, especially as I want to get this machine working again, but I think Ive compiled everything you might want to know about the format into video form, if I do say so myself. Well, Im sure thats not true, but hopefully most of it. As always, thank you so much for watching. And thank you to everyone who supports this channel on Patreon, especially these fine individuals. I know Ive said this before, but support from Patreon literally is what keeps these videos coming. Very soon this channel will become my full-time job thanks to the amazing support youve pledged.

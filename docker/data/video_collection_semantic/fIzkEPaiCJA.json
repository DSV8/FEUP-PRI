    "transcript": "but the thing is you've had the whole day to practice and I just woke up like 10 minutes ago so don't don't expect miracles this is the first time I've let out the game oh okay so we're both fresh it's not running on this board I see you file panic again good game so as the year comes to a close you my friend have come to the right place to see which gaming mice deserve our recommendation and these have gone through insane flicks unintentional range moments but best of all delivers that satisfying feeling of being number one on the scoreboard gonna get a kill now I trust my aim you should probably - but you know what's better for you are two opinions so in this video you have a special FPS guest die from rocket jump ninja whom I consider an expert in gaming mice because of this so yeah he's really good and you should take his recommendations for real let's begin right after this what would you like so I'm looking for a gaming headset with a bit of everything but not overkill something that folds on your neck sure how about the light frame without excessive clamping force yes yes you have to be air cushions with proper internal padding excellent I will take the cable and the microphone are removable fine fine this is the one multi-platform compatibility with virtual surround sound dongle avail can I just take one and the sound quality you'll be satisfied with so the new coolermaster MH 751 and 75 to are here to make your gaming experience alright so my first recommendation goes to my favorite Mouse of all the SteelSeries rival 310 it is over a year old but this is my favorite wired mouse to date with their light non braided cable bungee is always recommended though an incredible sensor of course fantastic button layout and field especially that low profile fin to change the CPI and they've made this button larger on the rival 600 series I don't really like that the side grips have enough friction and most importantly it's only 88 grams with the most comfortable shape for my hand size and the flick on top is the price you can pick this up for around 55 bucks to 6 dollars and it is an absolute steal if you want to improve your aim and stick around with something for a while the rival 310 is highly recommended and you can check out full reviews of all the mice we were talking about today in description below plus pricing and availability my second Mouse of choice is the latest from Logitech the G Pro Wireless this is the mouse if you want to cut the cord for your serious gaming needs we've got the latest and greatest sensor in there that the super power efficient yet delivers outstanding performance we no longer have to be skeptical of using you know Wireless in a professional setting and best of all it is super light at only 80 grams and for wireless mouse that is incredible the gaming experience with this thing is you know very satisfying the scroll wheel is nice primer clicks so nice you can store away the USB receiver inside the mouse and the battery for me lasts for about a week so I never have to worry I find the ambidextrous shaped comfy for my hybrid grip plus you can add or swap side browser buttons for left or right hand use and the only caveat is the price since this is the best wireless mouse that I've used to date but not to worry my third mouse recommendation for 2018 goes out to the Logitech G305 that is also wireless and basically has the same performance as the G Pro Wireless selector you know older sensor with a smaller shape that for my hand is slightly better and the clutter on top is the price at around fifty bucks basically it has the same shape as the original G pro wired mouse that I love it is a bit heavier toe at ninety five grams because of the double-a battery but weight can be reduced if using a lithium battery so just keep that in mind and because there are no lights it will last for over 200 hours of continuous operation so battery life is excellent and the USB receiver can also be stashed away inside the body and for real this feels like using a wired mouse without any performance compromises but of course it is Wireless but now let's hear what Zy has to say all great choices I could probably say the same but for the sake of variety I'm going to say three different ones first the finalmouse air 58 it's not available right now but I want to point out why it's so popular the shape is amazing it has a top optical sensor and they've managed to get a large Mouse down to about 58 grams a normal Mouse this size would be about a hundred grams some people do like the extra weight in their mice but a lot of competitive players are finding they can aim much better with lighter mice so the Air 58 is extremely popular which is waiting on stock and for other mice to get even lighter next is my new personal favorite the Zowie Fk series which should be available in December 2018 stay tuned for updates it's a mouse worth keeping an eye on I was using the FK2 for years and the S2 is similar but a bit shorter and a bit taller really good changes to the point I can feel more confident aiming and I already am near my best with the FK2 so that's saying something and the third the Logitech G403 still one of my favorites and still the top Mouse even two years after its release I'm sure everyone already knows about that one though all three mice basically have the same top optical sensor it's just a matter of personal preference if you ever watch my channel I recommend finding a mouse 60% of your hand measurements small mice seem easier to aim would go too small and you might get cramps in your hand have to find the balance so any one of these mice could be the topic for you and I have to give a shout-out to the Razer Mamba Wireless 2018 this one surprised me I really wasn't expecting you to be so good but at about 105 grams it's not too heavy and the shape is one of the best for hands of eight inches by four inches and the wireless performance is like wired speaking of wireless I really have to talk up your picks the Logitech G Pro Wireless is the number one Mouse on my list at the moment and the Logitech G 305 is my number 6 they are absolutely amazing mice highly recommended but it really depends on your hand size and what you want so even though the G Pro Wireless is my number one I use some mouse listed at number three if the G Pro Wireless was my recommended size I would use that with that question there really asks so many good choices at the moment even the rival 310 is one of my favorites you just have to find what's right for you come on where's the peak what Oh cuz you are protected yeah and vulnerability so I really want that final Mouse now thanks I but my audible recommendation goes out to the slightly older Zowie FK1 it is still in my drawer for a reason because it fits my grip so well and I love the driverless cycle between the four dpi levels at the bottom approach and I feel like my aim is perfect every time I use it and it sells for around 60 bucks and it is definitely worth it and so to recap here is a full list of gaming mice we recommend with excellent wired and wireless options in there plus attractive price points for many they'll all be linked description below so check him out and I really want to thank Zy from rocket jump ninja for his expertise and recommendations for best mice to buy in 2018 and so make sure to subscribe to this channel for more FPS goodness you're welcome and thanks for having me on I have a video explaining how to choose the right Mouse you can check the description for the link to that so I hope that helps good luck alright guys so that is it from us hopefully these recommendations are helpful for you to decide on maybe getting in your mouth so you can improve your aim and become better you know player overall but let me know which Mouse you're walking now and potentially upgrade to later on I'm a Dmitry make sure to subscribe to Zy and yeah we'll see you in the next video and happy gaming good luck with the aim make sure it's good stay on top of the board's people stay on top of the oh my god I'm winning I'm 4-3 let me just take the salinity to screen show this enjoy it yeah I'm gonna play me it has been great see you later",

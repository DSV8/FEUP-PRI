    "transcript": "it's been a while since we've had some properly garbage gaming on this channel but I think what's in this box may change that now in this box is the cheapest Microsoft Surface tablet available new and I'm pretty excited to try some varyingly inappropriate levels of gaming on it oh that that required a lot less Force than I was expecting and hey okay oh they sent over the pen and by they I mean Micro Center that sent over the cheapest Microsoft Surface that they have thank you very much Micro Center oh yeah yeah what a beauty here is the cheapest new Microsoft Surface you could buy from a Micro Center you can see here that it cost 400 new and it is a Microsoft Surface go 3. now what I find really interesting about gaming on this device is that it has Windows 11 on it so we may have quite a big variety of games available to us to play on it but we'll figure all of that out a little bit later uh let's open the box and have a closer look at it but first I want to open the pen because that's fascinating oh there's like a little tuggy thing does it does it all undo with one pull no wow the pen feels quite nice it is plastic but it's it's sturdy enough plastic and here we have what almost looks like a little felt tip and then on the back we have like an eraser bit yeah that looks like a reasonable writing utensil all right oh that's a nice touch we've got little Graphics that show you where all the i o is and what it all does on the bit of I don't know is this like rice paper below that we've got some bookies in here and then this is I'm assuming like the power cable and stuff let's have a look at that oh it's actually got a very similar smell in the Box to Apple products you know that neutral clean smell I thought you had to pay at least a thousand dollars for that smell oh that's a cute little charger over here it's got like a fold the out bit with a very proprietary looking power plug which is a bit naughty wow this is quite a nice little tablet on the back we've got the Microsoft logo and it's like a really nicely finished metal and oh this got this little stand that pops open so you can kind of rest it on the table and that is actually metal as well and then on the bottom we've got the proprietary connector for like attaching a keyboard to it which doesn't come with this one because you know it's the cheapest model interestingly the cameras are on the long edge of the device which along with the bottom keyboard Mount thing shows that its primary orientation is landscape mode which hints at this being more a laptop tablet Abomination hybrid thing than just like a straight up tablet which should make it pretty good for gaming I guess I don't know we'll see in terms of IO around the sides there's there's not a whole lot we do have a power button up here with a volume rocker but that's kind of all we have on the top of the device I guess this is what that is and then this is where most of our i o is we have our proprietary power connector which I don't know why that couldn't have just been another USBC Port but you know capitalism I guess and then here is our USB C port word hopefully we can get a video signal out of this type c because I have some ideas for that later in the video and then finally we have our AUX port which is a nice touch we can still plug headphones into the device but we don't care about any of this do we the specs is what gives us the indication of the kind of gaming Carnage we can expect cpu-wise we're working with an Intel Pentium gold 6500y ah yes Pentium that would have gotten us real excited 25 years ago we also have a staggering four gigs of LP DDR3 RAM and 64 gigs of emmc storage this thing is looking like a real Beast now I'm gonna be honest I didn't do any research going into this video I just saw that it has Windows on it so we can probably do some gaming on it but I don't know that for a fact so we're gonna have to we're gonna have to find that out together foreign okay so I think this has like s mode Windows 11 on it so it's like a slightly lower power version of it but hopefully that doesn't impact our ability to install like Steam and stuff uh actually I forgot we got the pen with it as well so we can oh that is really weird the pen is starts registering before you touch the screen but anyway in terms of VD we don't have anything extra on here it's just Windows 11 but it makes sense it's a Microsoft device it's not the fastest device if you do a thing that it didn't really expect you to do it it kind of freaks it out a little bit and it takes a moment for it to figure out what's going on at this point I discovered that in order to install any apps other than Microsoft apps you need to switch out of S Mode which is as easy as just activating a thing which is good but first let's see what kind of games we can play in S Mode but first I desperately wanted a better way to interface with the surface honestly the first thing I want to do is plug peripherals into it so let's let's give that a try foreign very slowly I mean the fact that it can't even load the thumbnails for the games I feel like isn't a good sign I mean honestly this is some playable Roblox action it's not running exceptionally well and I have no idea what the settings are or frame rate is but this is kind of playable oh oh what's happened oh no and with that it was time to disable S Mode and try and play some real games getting steam up and running was surprisingly seamless all I had to do was get some switch out of s mode and then I could install Firefox MSI afterburner and steam I could even run games off of an external drive but idiot proof setup process aside can it actually run any of the games no way GTA 5 at 1080p ish normal settings is actually running I mean running is a strong word but still a few moments later uh okay that did not last very long maybe if we lower the resolution it'll run a bit longer before it crashes well we've made it further down the first street so that's a good start uh here we're running at the equivalent of 720P oh no it's crashed again oh I actually think we got a full-blown system crash here and not just the game okay so it lasted like 10 seconds longer but it took the whole system down this time hey we got further we're actually into downtown now and it's still running now that the game is actually running you can see that the CPU is bottlenecking the igpu which is one of my favorite things in the world when that happens because it's just so ridiculous but um yeah look at that we've actually got GTA 5 running now again with this kind of test when you start out with a high resolution where the system can't run it at all and you get to a point where you have you know like 16 or 17 frames per second it actually feels really playable then like it's like wow okay 16 frames per second feels decent at least it's running you know we're playing uh no it's crash this is probably really stupid but let's try Battlefield 5. it can render the loading icon which is a good start that's promising wow we get to run the menus which on a lot of these low powered systems is not even an option so I mean what this is already better than expected it may have been several lifetimes but we've actually loaded into the deployment screen hopefully we can spawn before the game crashes oh we're in this is by far the worst I've seen Battlefield 5 actually run like in game yes the menus and stuff work but I've never seen it load in and give us a frame every two minutes oh we got two frames there and we got kicked I think is what happened there uh yeah you lost connection I'm assuming the game server realized that someone was in there gaming on an easy bake oven and it just kicked us uh so let me try single player quickly single player briefly launched but once the game realized what Hardware it was actually running on it crashed pretty quickly I then quite bravely tried cyberpunk which obviously didn't even launch so I decided to try something quite a bit easier to run this is honestly one of the oldest cliches on the channel little potato system struggles to run any games but then runs the crap out of Half-Life 2. this is at just over 1080P and we are getting over 60 frames per second which actually is not as good as I was expecting it to run to be honest Half-Life 2 usually runs better than this but we'll find a way to make it run even worse in a second but first let's just try the more demanding bit in the game just over 60 and Half-Life 2 is done this is not amazing uh but let's make it run worse and then just like that we have a 48 inch 4K potentially 120 hertz tablet let's let's make sure it is no it's running at 30 Hertz and unfortunately 4K 30 Hertz is the highest resolution the little igpu in the Microsoft Surface can output which in all fairness is probably not going to be a problem for the kind of gaming performance we're gonna get from this thing at 4K now with GTA 5 I'm not entirely hopeful it's gonna work uh considering that at 1080p it could game for like 10 seconds and then would crash but maybe maybe it was just underutilized maybe the tablet was just so offended by us giving it such a loser load that it didn't even want to try and at 4K it'll be so happy with the challenge that it'll run perfectly lie yeah it just crashed wow okay down here in our little cave it does run well enough for it to destroy our refresh rate foible that we have so even though we're getting a respectable frame rate of over 60 it feels like garbage and there's lots of tearing again we are just above the refresh rate problem that we have with the display and honestly that to me is actually kind of impressive it is low settings but it is 4K on the cheapest Microsoft Surface you can buy and it's been essentially Plug and Play right so that's that's pretty cool that looks real 1999 right there uh let's actually crank the settings and see what that does has it crashed oh no it's just taken very long wow it's made a huge difference to the quality though and it's actually not impacted our frame rate that badly it is running very similarly we lost like six or seven frames per second and that six or seven frames per second we can't utilize because of the refresh rate anyway so um yeah look at that we can actually run Half-Life 2 at high settings 4K and if you have a low enough standard this is playable which brings me to the end of the first bit of gaming Carnage on the channel in a while and it kind of made me curious about gaming on a high-end Microsoft Surface let me know in the comment section down below if you want to see that and thank you for watching if you enjoyed the video consider subscribing to the channel to see more videos like this one and maybe consider watching another video suggest it'll pop up in a second and until three seconds from now bye-bye foreign",

    "transcript": "this video is brought to you by NCIX.COM great technology selection and service hello everyone this is Dmitry with Hardware Canucks and I just realized that we have produced and surpassed 400 videos released on this channel so give us a like if you'd want to see 400 more now this has given us many opportunities to highlight some of the best top quality and value for many products out there so in this episode we're doing a top 5 gaming mice to consider if you're looking to upgrade your current Mouse or just looking to get a sense of what is available on the market now these are not in any particular order but instead we hope to provide an objective top 5 gaming mice that we have reviewed and starting with number one the rocket ion now you can click on the name on the top right corner to view our full reviews on each of these mice but this one seriously has one of the best button layouts you can find on the mouse with awesome easy shift plus functionality that adds secondary commands to each of your buttons there's a tilt joystick for aircraft control and there's also a fence switch that isn't very comfortable to use but could serve helpful for additional macros the ergonomics are top-notch with proper thumb inserts curvature of the top frame with a slant to the right to properly support your palm and I love the scroll wheel it has very distinct scroll steps and is also light enough to press there is something I consider crucial for a gaming mouse now this is a laser option but with proper configuration in the software the tracking is super precise without noticeable acceleration and let's not forget the awesome rim lighting that you can actually see while you're using the mouse if you got the means to afford this $99 product we would highly recommend this to get on your list now for number two we've got the asus rog Gladius this is their latest gaming mouse as of making in this video and it's got a lot going for it the grippy sides allow light holding with good support along with proper thumb rest and extra form on the opposite side to accommodate for your ring and pinky fingers the optical sensor used in this mouse is considered one of the best on the market and if you have committed to optical mice you would definitely love this the scroll wheel and quick dpi change behind it are tactile and allow users to switch between two dpi without needing to cycle through as even one eye game I use only two DPI steps to increase it in decrease it if I get into a vehicle and if I exit and the best part about the Gladius would be the swap well on run switches as ASUS includes an extra pair that you can replace yourself for a different resistance click on either primary buttons and you can even mix them up to suit your resistive map reference the red lighting looks sexy to suit the rog color scheme and the Gladius is a strong contender within this list that should be considered just for $79 moving on to number three Mionix Avior 7000 and Mionix NAOS 7000 now I've grouped these two together as they use an identical sensor and just vary in the form as you can't avoid the left hand users so for those who require that left hand operation the Avior 7000 is a good place to start the NAOS 7000 has been my daily driver ever since release and I've come to appreciate that slightly wider body that fits my hand like a glove for that thumb support and both ring and pinky fingers covered in a soft touch coating both mice offers superb build quality but don't be thrown off by the lightweight it is unfortunate there is no weight customization but you quickly can adjust to the lightweight for both the Avior and the nails they use outstanding switches for your primary left and right click and excellent site browser buttons for soft roll off that provide tactile actuations but continue to travel inside the body that prevents it from affecting your aim this is a brilliant feature the optical sensor used here provide outstanding tracking given you combine this with a proper dark hard surface mat for best results and finally the subtle lighting features of an illuminated logo and the scroll wheel are super appreciated with full RGB spectrum that allows seamless color matching to the rest of your setup and at $79 both the Avior and the NAOS 7000 form a well-rounded bundle for lefties and an extremely comfortable Mouse experience on the nails as well coming in at number four we have the CM Storm Mizar for those on the limited budget but still want the proper ergonomic design good switches and the trusted Avago 9800 laser sensor so the Mizar might be a way to go you get RGB illumination on the mouse a proper Glide feet at the bottom and rubberized sides for a better grip along with large browser buttons for your thumb the scroll wheel is not the best at least not as nearly as good as with the other mice on this list but the dpi change buttons behind the scroll wheel are appreciated with good access that for sure will come in handy and for $59 the CM storm is our rounds off the features with a trusted layout to still be competitive and on the last gaming mouse on the list at number 5 is the logitech g502 proteus core this is an extremely popular mouse for gamers that offer outstanding ergonomics with deep curve for your thumb and proper top surface curvature for comfortable handling now for larger hands due to such a slim profile you might not find it as comfortable but this would be a total killer profile for smaller hands all of the switchers are outstanding with really fast primary switches for FPS titles for example quick dpi levels with LED indicators and a sniper button to quickly activate your preferred sensitivity when it is pressed this is also the only Mouse in this list with customizable weights that comes with a storage compartment and that's really appreciated so you don't lose them the g502 features an optical sensor with awesome precise tracking and the only thing to be aware of how the teflon feet at the bottom that on our sample were out easily and became an annoyance with tracking and there are many other cases like this online so there's no replacement feet included but it seems Logitech has addressed this issue by sending out replacement feet and they also believe that extra set is now included in all the packaging and well that would be it for our top 5 gaming mice that we have reviewed as they have gone through our deep analysis but let us know if any other gaming mice that you would recommend to the viewers to expand the horizon of a half a million options that we already have available and if you're an owner of any of these mice mentioned on this list are you happy with your current setup or considering to change for something else well let us know in the comments below make sure to check out our full reviews of all these mice here as always thanks for watching consider subscribing for more similar content and we'll see you in the next one",

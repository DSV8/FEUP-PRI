    "transcript": "- We've only done six videos about cases and we focused on specimens that are exceptionally popular, exceptionally weird or exceptionally innovative. And the DanCase C4-SFX falls rectangularly into the third category. Your picky SO will be delighted by its classy appearance and modest size and you will be blown away by its versatility. The build we're gonna be tag teaming today is the ultimate red box. We're gonna be rocking a 7800 X3D, the ultimate gaming CPU and we're gonna be pairing it with a gigabyte Aorus Elite 7900 XTX which is the ultimate. - Don't worry, it fits. Trust me. - Is that the motherboard chip set fan? How far are we gonna go taking it apart? Oh, okay. In spite of competition from case makers both small and large, DanCase has maintained their position as a leader in small form factor case innovation. At just 14.7 liters, this thing is small but mighty. Every single side panel is perforated to maximize airflow and if we peek at the back of the case, we see three PCI E-slot covers, meaning that this case has support for quad-slot cards, but this is weird. They're at the top. This kinda looks like a spot for a slim optical drive but surely it's an air duct. No way. - Yeah. No way. - They designed... Oh really. They designed a separate intake so Nvidia founders edition cards will draw fresh air not from the CPU area, which is back here, but rather from directly outside the case. - Close. It's for the exhaust. So that instead of dumping hot air from your GPU onto your CPU, it just blows it out the side. - Well how's this gonna blow it out the side? - Because it's a flow through cooler, so it pulls in from the top, flows through at the bottom so instead of dumping it down. - No it doesn't. - Yeah. No it pulls in here. - No, it flows downwards. - But look at the fan blades. They go this way. Unless... - The motherboard. The motherboard's - on this side. Wait! You don't even need a PCIe riser. - I know. It's genius. - This is awesome! - If you think about it, it's just a normal case but it's just upside down. - So it's just an inverted case which is totally a thing that exists. - It's just small. They just were so clever about it. - I like it. I can't believe I put a 4090 in here. Out the back of the case out here. So we are blowing some of it here but then also out the side. Of course, we're not using a 4090. - We're using something bigger. It'll take a little brain power but... - (laughs) Okay. It's a good thing they don't use rivets. - Yeah, there's no rivets on this case anywhere. It's all screws. So you can actually take the whole thing up completely apart. You can even flip it right side up if you want. - Oh, like reassemble it. - Yeah. In a conventional layout. - Exactly. What are you doing? - Am I not taking out this brace? - That's not how I, that's not how I would do it, but... - Sure. I mean, tell you what, why don't you start doing it your way. I'll start doing it my way and we'll see who gets it done faster. That'll be the theme of this video. What the heck, Adam? How is this supposed to go in here? There's a USB cable and that's the difference between this fitting and not fitting. - Yeah, but watch this. - Whoa! Hold on. No, no, she goes, she goes. Oh, I got it in. It only fits because I haven't screwed this in yet. - Yeah, yeah. (both laugh) As you can see, we have room up here to mount some fans. Right. Wait, what? - We can do a 280 mil round up here if we want. - Not with this in it. - Not with these in it. The benefit is, is that we can install these 150 millimeter fans which will blow more air at lower volume. - Nope. Well, okay. The word volume is very... - I'm sorry, love using in this context. - That will be quieter. Yeah, so it'll blow... - More air more quietly. - Yeah. Okay. (laughs) While Adam works on the power supply, let's talk about our CPU. It's the 7800 X3D. It's the fastest gaming CPU on the planet. Sometimes the extra cores on the 7950 X3D win out and sometimes the stupid high clocks on the 13900 KS can lead to better performance in games. But this thing makes pretty much every CPU that costs more irrelevant, at least as far as gaming is concerned. Oh, just like I'm concerned. I might have forgotten the segue to our sponsor. - Oh snap. - The Ridge. Simplify your life with the Ridge Wallet. It's slim design allows you to carry your essential cards and cash without weighing you down. Follow the link below and use code Linus to save 10% off your purchase and get free shipping. - For our motherboard, we've gone with the ROG Strix X670E-I gaming EI. EI, EI, O. Sorry, sorry. It's the err motherboard for AM5 ITX right now. It'll deliver the full compliment of 24 PCIe Gen-5 lanes for both the GPU and SSD along with enough high speed USB to choke a horse. Why do you wanna choke a horse? I don't know. You're the one who wants to choke a horse. Not me. (horse neighs) It definitely has some idiosyncrasies. Installing an SSD on this thing is like solving one of those weird science shop puzzles. Like how did get a thing in there? And all the front IOs on this bizarre daughter board. What do you expect? It has to fit everything you'd have on a full-size board onto a lethal tiny one. - You know what's kind of interesting about this? Is it we have multiple ways to put our PSU in. - [Linus] Is that an 1100 watt power supply? - [Adam] Yeah. - It's so small. - I know, right? - Why are you so small? - I think only just a year ago was the first like 1000 watt SFXL power supply introduced and now this is SFX and it has more watts. - It kind of cheats though. Yeah. Hey, the modular interface is poking a centimeter out. In some small form factor cases, that's gonna be a big problem but I guess we're making it work. - [Adam] We can adjust the height of our PSU bracket which means that the wiring should be doable as well as we can get rid of this airflow diverter since we have a full length board on this graphics card. - It either goes onto here or you just take this solid entirely and you just put it here? - No, that's actually a mounting point for your SSDs. - Okay. - You want two and a half inch to save it. - Why does it line up with this power supply then? - Whoa, can you do that too? - Okay, so these three on the bottom are all lined up and then these ones on the top are like not quite. There's like, it's like two of them are. You could put five screws on this power supply. That's plenty. If you had a cooler on your... Oh my God, where's the motherboard go? - [Adam] This is the motherboard cut. - Oh yeah, motherboards way over here. So, oh yeah, totally. - Yeah. There is no reason - that that couldn't work. Just like we've seen on Intel for over a decade, the latest AMD CPUs are using an LGA socket. So the installation method is exactly the same as it is on Intel and it's done. Now I gotta figure out how to get this bloody SSD in here. Don't tell me. I wanna figure it out. - It's a, it's a journey. - Wait, why can't I just put it here? - Oh, well, we have a we have a Gen-5 SSD and that's the Gen-4 slot. - I think I understand why they opted for this. If you wanted an SFXL and this bracket, that would allow it. Because right now there's just not enough space if this was any longer. - How does this even enter, oh, hi. All right. That wasn't that bad. Oh wait. Aorus sent over a Gen-5 SSD for this? - Yeah. - Gen-5 SSDs offer no tangible benefit for gaming or anything else. - But more fast is not, you know, it is... It's more better. - This is hilarious. What we're looking at here is a PCIe Gen-5 link to the second AMD chip set that makes a motherboard an X670 rather than a B-series board. Normally, they would have the two chip sets on the board and that's where you get those Gen-5 lanes that go to one of the SSDs. But it sits on a daughter board on this one cause after they put the one on here, they just plain shucks shoot, didn't have anywhere else to put it. That is quite the bent SSD right now. I don't think I did anything wrong but here we are. Now I noticed that we have a couple of different options for coolers. I see a Kraken X63 over here as well as an Noctua NH-D9L. Because we have this side bracket - Yeah that we can mount - a radiator to as well. So we can do a 280 millimeter RAD for the CPU. I guess the tubing on this side. - Yeah. Yeah. - Well, yeah. - Cause there'll be too, there won't be enough space over here. - Yeah, it's gonna be, it's gonna be all blah if it's on this side. - Or you can make your life easy. - I mean have you ever known me to take the easy path? - Ah, no. - What's with these crap fans? - NZXT, that's what it. - Yeah but they're not gonna seal against the RAD if you have them pulling through. There's giant gaps here. Why are cooler manufacturers still doing this? They only seal against it giving you better static pressure if you blow through which makes it really hard to clean. Stupid. (fan drops) - We have so I need to grab some more. Oh. All right. - Better fans. - One thing to note is that if you're doing a D-SHRAD MOD on your GPU, some manufacturers like to put a warranty sticker over the back of it even though it's technically not enforceable. But your best course of action if you're doing this, is to take some heat to the sticker to try and melt it off a little bit and then peel it off cleanly. I didn't do that. Gigabyte will not replace this for us if I (beep) this up. - The thing about the whole warranty sticker thing is that you're not technically wrong. It is not technically legal for them to deny your warranty claim just because you opened up the device. But legal or not, nothing prevents them from just dicking you around. What's the purpose of this little redirector shroud thing here? - I don't know. I think it's for cable management, but for me it only just inhibited where I could put the cables. Or maybe it's just chamber separation. - I knew I was gonna screw up this orientation. I wanted these down. I mean this is fine. I'm not redoing it. - Yeah. - Not only does this fit, but for the size of this case, it's not even looking like it's gonna be a big problem. For maintenance, I would mount these fans on the other side pulling air in, but for performance, this config is actually probably fine. - [Adam] Don't you even, oh my God, that's a little much. - That is a lot of paste, Adam. - That's a little, I'm gonna wipe it up. - [Linus] It's gonna be all over the place. - I'm not done yet! Gosh!. - What do you mean you're not done yet? - I'm gonna. You've already got enough - on there. - But I'm gonna take some of it off, a little off the top, okay? It's like the when you pour a Guinness, you you scrape the foam. (laughs) - [Andrew] There's an Irishman here. - Yeah. Really? You're gonna say that in front of him? - [Andrew] Very disgusted right now. - Cool. (laughs) This is amazing. It's like a little fortress around the CPU. You cannot pass. - Yeah, don't. No, what are you doing? - [Andrew] Oh no. Oh no. - These are all laid out so I could re-screw them in easy. There's like four different types of screws. - Cool. That's all you give for me. - Not a sorry. Not a oops, my bad. Cool. - I don't wanna lie to you. - Now hold on just a gosh darn second. Are we gonna have enough static pressure to push air through this heat sink? - Oh yeah. - The fans are like right up against it. - Yeah. Yeah. Wow. - There's like millimeters of room. You could, we could cut a bracket if we wanted but I did thermal testing on it and it runs cool. - [Linus] This has 11 heat pipes on it. - [Adam] Yeah, I know. Look at this. It's insane what's going on there. - There are two USB-C connectors on this board. Male USB-C connectors. You don't need to attach anything to them. There is a power switch header over here. You can use that but there's a second power switch header along with your reset switch and your hard drive and your power LED headers right here along with two USB-2 headers and two SATA ports. And these just plug into those USB-C connectors a little something like that. - What is this switch though? Wait. - We do need it. We have SATA. - Oh snap. - I don't know if they still make them but at some point, they made these super cool, low profile SATA cables. Oh no, I want the eight pin CPU connector before I put this on. - Oh yeah. Where's that? - Oh wait, here's another sick feature. You made a dumb dumb forget move and now you gotta fix it. What do you do? Here, lemme make your life easier for you. - Wait, wait. - Yeah! Wait. - Are these so you can cable manage on the other side of this? - I mean you could. I'm just talking about how... Look at that. So now that you forget your cables or you need to redo your cable management or you wanna do your fans at the end of the build. - Oh. There you just enter. - They just take the bottom off. - That's so cool. - I am like just endlessly impressed by this case. Cuz every single time I go, oh man, I screwed up. It feels like they're there to catch me. - The coolest thing about this case is the way that it gets out of the way. Pretty much every heat generating component is just drawing fresh air directly from the outside. So as long as that hot air makes its way away from the computer, there's no recycling. We need to plug in all our fans now before I put this on and we need to do our 24 pin power play. Okay, I thought you were in charge of the power supply. - I thought yeah but you had the motherboard and usually you want to do the motherboard with the cables. It's okay. You got it. We're gonna be in there. Don't worry. - Mm. You're being angry. - It's okay. - I'm not just hungry. I'm not angry or hungry. - That's okay, Wen. Show's not that far away. We're almost there. - You know what really minimizes my feelings when you attribute to - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - outside factors. - That's not fair. You're right. - They're valid. - Yes. No they are. I'm sorry, I didn't need to dismiss it. - How many times have you put that GPU in it? - I, okay this is, two. - Are you done with the GPU yet? - I need to get these fans in. - I need to get these fans hooked up. Wait, well we can hook them up now. - Yeah, that's what we're doing. - Oh for... - Yeah, I need to get the fans in and then the GPU goes in. - I just mean you didn't give me these extensions. - No, I'm sorry. We're just gonna smush everything down in there. Cool. We are not gonna have a big issue with fit. There's a lot of cable in a very small area and I got kind of sausage fingies. - Or can I just... - Yeah, you get your delicate little lady hands in there. Yeah. Okay. - What the hell is this? This is your cable management? - This is my only choice at this point. - Sir. - Sir. Sir. - It's a shorter adapter than I thought. - It's not your only choice at all. It's not even too late to fix it. Sweet. - This does not look like it's gonna do very well. - Yeah. Listen, I'm telling you - the thermals on this thing were outta this world. I did the testing. - Did you? I did. - Did you though or did the lab do it? Because... - I did the testing actually. - Really? Yeah. - I trust it more If the lab did it. - I should have said the lab did it. - So these GPU cables are gonna be. Yeah, okay buddy. Jeez. - Now this thing better fricking turn on. - Yeah. While it's pretty fun to build small form factor computers if you enjoy puzzles, what's not fun is having one thing wrong with the puzzle that requires a whole puzzle to be taken apart and then redone, that's not fun. Can you see the back plate of this GPU? - [Andrew] Yeah, it looks like it's cracked almost yeah. - Oh that's just how it is. - What? Yeah. - I don't believe you. - [Adam] That is how it is. That's how I pulled up on the box. This tripped me up like 17 times when I was... - Are you sure? - Yeah, cuz I, it just goes like that. - Oh. Here the - [Adam] You can see the front panel on it. - This GPU looks like it's sitting in here like that. This doesn't make any sense. Cool feature of the case that we didn't talk about yet. You can put your pass through for the power supply in either of these two positions. Just make sure you don't stick your dumb finger through the one that you're not using and then have to put this stupid grommet back in. - I brought some cases for comparison so we got the Meshroom. - Ooh. - Yeah, that's pretty fun. It's basically this but standing. And it's a sandwich layout so it does require a PCI-E riser cable. - This is a little bit larger in terms of volume but - Not much, - it does allow some ATX components. GPUs. - Wait, you can put an ATX board in here? - Yes, but only, but then you can't put like a full length GPU. - Oh. - And then this is probably the most direct kind of comparison which is the NR200P. - And it's quite a bit bigger. - It's quite a bit bigger. - The funny thing about small form factors that as you get close to the limits, there's not really a lot of benefit in terms of desk space. It's just more about the coolness. - Yeah. And this has - lots of coolness. Is it going to work though? What is that fan? Is that the motherboard chip set fan? - Yeah, it's stupid. - Jesus, I don't think it posted. That chip set fan is still going full bore. How far are we gonna go taking it apart? - Oh! What. - It's fine. Oh my god. - Okay, bye. Well we did our best. And one BIOS update definitely wasn't user error later, we're up and running! But while temperatures are pretty solid with the CPU maxing out at 85 degrees and the GPU something. - 62. - Wow! Okay, that's really good. It's kind of loud. I'm thinking we might have screwed up this fan orientation. We might be better off pulling fresh air from the outside and just hoping it'll find somewhere to go. Can we turn it around and see if it gets quieter. Oh balls, really? And this is why we have to build systems before we just say a case is really great. Doesn't fit in there. The RADs a touch wider. - Holy prevent fans on that side. - Yeah, but then it's hard to clean. - Yeah. - That's the whole reason I did it this way in the first place. - You could, you could force it on there. Just bend it. - Oh my God. - I mean that is technically an option. - You know what? I'm going for it. - [Andrew] Just do it yeah. - I refuse to build a system that is that hard to maintain. - It is a lot quieter. It is substantially quieter - Way quieter - and we're still within, we're still within the 90 degree limits that we want for our 7,800 XTD, so. - Yeah. - My concern was that if we're drawing air in and heating it up, drawing air and heating it up, the bottom is basically the only place you can exhaust anymore. And so my concern was that all that hot air was just gonna come - and recirculate. - and recirculate. - [Adam] It doesn't seem to be an issue with the GPU. Like GPU temps are just incredibly under control. - This is really impressive. Nearly full turbo with the entire system absolutely pinned. For those of you who are wondering how we did with air cooling though, we tested with the NH-D9L which is quite a bit easier to work with and got not quite the same performance in our synthetic full load test but it handled gaming just fine. And if you wanted to get nearly the same results as this, you could probably go with the D12. We just didn't have one for testing at this time. I think it's worth showing what temps are like in a game. - Yeah. We've pretty much settled in - at 66 on the GPU and nearly full turbo on our CPU. This is really impressive. I bet I could even turn those radiator fans up a little bit. We'd be good to go. This thing's freaking awesome. I just want every computer to be in that now. - Yeah, why go bigger? - Maintenance. - Yeah. - Also, you said - you had some nitpicks. - Oh yeah. So I mean nitpicks. Front IO would've been nice to get more than just one USB-C port. - Oh I mean you can always go out into a dock if you really care about that, but yeah, sure fine. - [Adam] Maybe some included cable ties. There's no tie down spots. There's not really a good way to tie anything down. - [Linus] There's no window. - [Adam] And that too. - I'm not just trying to play devil's advocate. - No, I'm just saying that these are the... - I really like this case, so when you attack it, I feel like you're attacking me personally. (laughs) - And maybe a thumbs, maybe some thumb screws. - We're on ray tracing quality Ultra. Everything else cranked 4K and I don't think it's gonna handle it very... Oh wow. Okay. - You sure you're on ray tracing ultra? - Yep. - What do you have for Frank? - Ah, it's about 40. - Did we mention the price? - Oh no. How much is it? It's not like 300 bucks, is it? - It's 200 Euro. - So two 220 US right now. You have cheaper options like the NR200P or the Meshlicious that we brought out earlier. - But this one's so cool. But this one is so cool. - Just like this cool segue. To our sponsor. Eight Sleep. Okay, real talk. When I don't get enough sleep, I get cranky. Like an adult sized or almost adult sized baby.

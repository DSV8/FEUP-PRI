    "transcript": "I had a really great plan for our unboxing video for nvidia's Flagship RTX 4090 I was gonna unbox the founders Edition but then our lab said sorry Linus we need it for benchmarking so I wasn't able to do that then I was gonna unbox one from EVGA so we'll settle for the next best thing check out this it's the RTX 4090 from Zotac that's right friends love gaming power the win here we go this GPU starts at 1600 US Dollars which means all the cool features and performance you're about to hear about can be yours five to six years from now once the price drops to a more worldly level this bad boy features over 16 000 of nvidia's Cuda cores 24 gigabytes of gddr6x memory and wow a whopping power consumption of 450 Watts which necessitates ah this is cool this new PCI Express Gen 5 12 pin power connector not only does it have 12 volt and ground pins but it also has these sense pins that allow your GPU and your power applied to communicate their capabilities with each other to ensure that your system will never run out of spec now there's been quite a bit of discussion online about the fragility of these connectors apparently bending them at a really extreme angle can cause them to heat up this is actually true of typical PCI Express power connectors as well but what I will say is that the problem is probably exacerbated by the tiny tiny pins I wonder what the motivation was for that when you consider that the graphics cards these things are going to be attached to are so big oh I feel like it's too hot for TV but I'm gonna show it to you this monster Turbo's up to 2.52 gigahertz in the founders Edition configuration and overclocked cards could end up exceeding that 2.23 gigahertz base and in spite of all that Nvidia claims that configured with a Ryzen* 5900 X CPU you shouldn't need more than an 850 watt power supply in order to power it now what's really interesting to me looking at a card this size it has a whopping three what appear to be 100 110 millimeter fans but the actual length of the PCB is only up to here which means that this solid ass hunk of aluminum fins all down the back which also has a pass-through so you can see this fan right here is just blowing straight through the cooler is all needed to cool this thing good gravy now since everything but the unboxing is still embargoed by Nvidia I'm not able to share any of our own performance thermal or power consumption numbers with you guys but we can make some guesses as to where the RTX 49d is going to stack up in nvidia's lineup just based on the slides that they've published they didn't tell us too much about performance in traditional rasterized games but we did see anywhere from two to as much as four times the performance in games using uh RTX Ray tracing and their new dlss 3.0 technology so it's worth talking about those things more importantly though this video is brought to you by Vessi Footwear vessi Footwear is known for being lightweight easy to pack comfortable and most importantly water resistant with their dimetex technology their everyday move line is designed with added support at the midsole and better breathability to keep up with your active lifestyle you can take them off and put them on with ease thanks to the handy pull tab and they're made creature free so every step you take will be guilt-free unless you're stepping on creatures in which case you should feel pretty bad your feet will thank you for wearing these though even if the creatures you're stepping on don't so say goodbye to wet socks and save 25 with our offer code short circuit at bessie.com Short Circuit first up dlss 3.0 is looking kind of amazing the first two generations of dlss were pretty straightforward we rendered at a lower resolution then used machine learning to upscale that rendered out image to a higher resolution improving visual Fidelity while hopefully not having too many artifacts or anomalies the LSS 3.0 takes it to a whole new level generating entire frames in between your existing frames to help smooth out animations um I have to wonder if there's going to be a significant latency hit especially at the kinds of frame rates where you would need such a technology but that's something we're only going to be able to talk about once we can actually measure it the other big one though is that their new Ray tracing cores are supposedly up to double the performance and efficiency of their old ones which has led to some absolutely mind-bending demos okay this RC race car demo that Nvidia produced I think they had they say 30 of their artists work on it apparently uses no pre-baked lighting whatsoever so we are just looking at Material physics to create these effects that is the kind of thing that I have dreamed about in games since well since I was old enough to dream about it high school maybe whatever it looks really cool another big highlight for me has got to be RTX remix man this was a mind-blowing demo when they pulled out Morrowind and it looked like this the ability to take an older game and essentially import objects environments lighting and then edit the game and play it back with edited elements could be an absolute Game Changer now I have seen some folks actually speaking out against this type of remixing and the arguments are are pretty fair you know like you might take away the artist's intended Ambiance or you might lose things like a lighting effect that lit up that doorway so that the player would know where to go next but the flip side of that argument is this might be our only chance of preserving these types of experiences I mean single player games without you know a season's pass or any other kind of games as a service elements are going the way of the dinosaur and you know thinking about whether or not my kids would be able to enjoy a game like Morrowind I don't think so not without some changes I mean even for me I got into Elder Scrolls with the Oblivion entry and I went back and I tried to play Morrowind after beating Oblivion and I was like I don't think so throw in some better objects throw in some better lighting a few Creature Comforts the kinds that the modding Community has over the years built time and time again for classic games and man I mean I want to play it so I I guess what I'm trying to say is the more tools we can put in the hands of talented PC gaming modders the better and I commend Nvidia another big feature for RTX 40 series is their dual av1 encoders we haven't actually looked at nvidia's encoders yet because you know the thing I said before but what we have been able to do is look at the hardware av-1 encoders on Intel's Arc gpus and so far av1 is looking extremely promising we are talking similar performance to h.264 at around 60 the bit rate absolutely wild especially if you're someone who wants to game stream but you don't have an amazing internet connection or you want to Arc I have a ton of your gameplay footage and you don't want to deal with enormous file sizes also um Studio drivers and video reflex okay that's mostly stuff that we've seen before so why don't we take a closer look at the i o we've got HDMI 2.1 a all right as well as actually this is a bit of a disappointment three DisplayPort 1.4 ports I was kind of hoping for DisplayPort 2.0 uhbr 10 because that's what Intel is shipping on their Arc gpus but I guess we aren't getting that I do want to take a closer look at this Zotac card though this thing is absolutely wild is that nine heat pipes full-size back play with backlighting that's got to be like uh that's gonna be a mode switcher right here I actually don't really know that much about it because the reality of it is even at sixteen hundred dollars people are gonna buy it so ultimately you're gonna end up with whatever RTX 490 is in stock even if this thing is only you know 30 40 50 faster than a 30 90 TI in traditionally rendered games which it looks like it could very well be Nvidia really didn't want to talk about that that much 30 90 TI's are still going for like 800 to 950 bucks on eBay 30 90s though ooh 390s are down like 700 750 which means that could be a pretty compelling option compared to this that's got to be Jake leaving for the day he's the only one with a car that loud this is actually a greater than three slot card can you guys believe this we've gotten to the point where I mean how far off just having like a seven wide like you just put it in that top pcie slot and it's less of just it's less of a card and more of just like a module you just take the whole thing and you just put the whole thing in there it just takes up the whole Space you know now that I've said it someone like Jesus is totally gonna build that anyway we can't really speculate on all the details when it comes to Performance because we haven't been allowed to test the card and talk about it yet so that's it short circuit unboxing and get over on LTT so you can check out the full review",

    "transcript": "oh this is easily the dumbest money I've ever spent on the channel which is saying a lot because I've bought some dumb crap before but in this box there is a broken Alienware system now I hear a lot of you saying David have you ever seen a working Alienware oh you know Smokey comment aside this one's actually listed as broken on eBay and I I paid quite a lot of money for it uh which was especially stupid considering that they didn't list the specs of it so it's like online slot machine level gambling which is very stupid don't do it uh luckily there is a video sponsor that's going to help me financially recover from my terrible life decisions today's video sponsor puts the fun in Linux based cloud computing and web hosting service um it's the node lenode is a Linux based cloud computing and web hosting service that offers multiple products to manage cloud storage websites databases Game servers kubernetes and they can even handle whatever computational load you can imagine also if you value good customer support which you should the node is one of the best in the business I mean look at how happy these two are with their service if all of this sounds good to you sign up to the node using the link in my description below to get a 60 day 100 free credit thank you lenod for sponsoring today's video [Music] so as you can tell by this very embarrassing invoice I paid about a thousand Canadian before shipping and tax for this Alienware system that has specs that I don't know that's broken in an unspecified way oh I really hope I can salvage summon out of this [Music] part of any Alienware system the Box although it seems to have been stored at the bottom of a well wait why did they cut crop circles into the box oh it's probably like shipping labels right to hide their address [Music] oh it's nice of them to include the E-Waste peripherals with the system so that means if these still work we've made back like two dollars of the money we've sunk into this broken system and I can also tell from up here at least we know there's still a graphics card in it so that's that's also a good start may not be a working graphics card but we'll find out soon enough all right now in first impression we can tell a couple things about it it clearly wasn't curb stomped by Godzilla at some point there's no like clear external damage on the thing we can also tell that it's the previous generation Alienware desktop rebuilt the one with like the power supply right over the CPU Cooler here Alienware was really innovating in terms of CPU fan cooler BDSM with this design other than that it's clearly a used Alienware it's it's a bit gross on the front and we also have a ryzen 5000 sticker on the front now around the back again it looks promising there's no obvious physical damage or like Char marks or whatever but one thing that does worry me a little bit they've clearly opened it up this screw is missing so it means they've dug around on the inside of it may not be a problem maybe we'll see we'll find out but with that I can't wait anymore so everybody fingers crossed let's open it up and hope that there's something salvageable in here [Music] it always catches me off guard how shocking the interior of these systems are like what was Dell thinking oh that is quite a chunky looking graphics card in there let's remove this power supply and have a closer look now I can't exactly remember how this works but I think you flip this and then now of course it's an Alienware system so it's just gonna have a single stick of ram in it what size is it actually ah a single 16 gig stick skeletor's configuration of choice but we do have the optional AIO in the wild I've never seen this in one of the Alienware systems before and this is an upgrade that I feel like is an absolute minimum requirement for these systems considering the heinous power supply placement it has a 120 millimeter radiator which is a bit losery but it's a massive improvement over the asphyxiated air cooler but I'm still not sure what CPU is under this very exciting AIO block I'm not going to take it off yet because I do want to test fire the system before I actually touch anything just to see what it does now the graphics card is a real chunky boy I actually still can't see a sticker identifying what it is I think it's at least the 3080 because I've seen the Dell 3070 before and it is a much smaller heatsink and it only has one eight pin power connector so that's that's lighting that's promising stuff and if it's a working 3080 that's already pretty cool now again in terms of physical condition the interior is quite promising there's no obvious damage like it didn't look like there was a fire in here for example it's kind of getting me excited no I actually think what I'm gonna do before I dig around in it is I'm going to close it up plug it in and see what the system does and then we can start trying to diagnose it oh ew it's so gross to touch okay so we're getting orange flashes now those orange flashes mean a thing it's like an error code wow it is so noisy damn one two three yeah it's three flashes pause two flashes let's Google what that means oh okay that potentially kind of sucks according to the list three flashes and then two means PCI video failure so there's something wrong with the graphics card oh okay it's not catastrophic necessarily let's let's have a look inside foreign so well made now the first thing I'm going to try is reseating the graphics card because maybe somebody took it out and didn't put it back in correctly so let's give that a try it like barely fits in the front of the case look at that it's actually oh there we go oh that's quite a chunky graphics card for a Dell GPU although I'm still not sure what it is there's no like labeling on it anyway let's reseed this Anonymous Schrodinger's GPU and see if that helps foreign [Music] about the graphics card because why would they not test the most valuable component in the system before getting rid of it right anyway let's give it a try yeah it's straight back to to Orange wait is it two three or three two I think it's two three it turns out it was 2-3 in fact I was looking at the diagnostic list for the Alienware r13 which was very different from the list for the r10 which doesn't even have 3 2 as an option if it's two three it's not the graphics card and that sequence means system board memory or processor failure which is a bit vague it's kind of like saying shit's broken I guess but let's start off with the easiest one to test the memory so for now we can ignore the graphics card because the system may have just rejected the ram configuration which I don't blame you little buddy I'm gonna use this random stick I found lying around I think this actually came out of a Dell system so it's potentially a good test subject and I'm also going to put it in a different Ram slot on the motherboard in case the ram slots an issue nope same warning so let's try another kit of RAM and then we'll have a look at the CPU no still the same thing which means it's almost definitely not the ram so at this point it seems like it's either the CPU or the motherboard that's committed harakiri but before I start playing around with that let me just reset the CMOS and see if that helps it didn't oh lovely sound every time now we do get to find out what CPUs under there exciting stuff foreign [Music] well that explains why it doesn't work there's no CPU in it that's kind of got me worried though because why would they just take the CPU out of it and then sell the rest of it for parts unless it's all broken right now my mind is telling me the next step is to just test the graphics card to see if maybe that's still working even though considering the missing CPU I think it's increasingly unlikely that this GPU is actually working but my heart is telling me to try dropping a working Horizon CPU into this system to see to see what happens it's not a very good idea because if this motherboard is faulty it could kill the CPU as well but on the other hand the person removed the CPU from it which kind of implies it was still working so the motherboard may not have killed it that's good enough Logic for me let's drop this in there and see what happens okay so we are potentially sacrificing the CPU to the gods of Alienware but we'll see since when you let me buy stuff at like 12 at night for a YouTube video this is what happens okay so hopefully I don't lose components in this process let's see oh no it's the same warning it's not good I I guess now all that's left to do is rip the graphics card out of it and hope that it works in a different system as unlikely as I know it is maybe they were being nice and left me a graphics card for my troubles so it's Let's test it and see okay well it lights up it's making a lot of noise no way yes oh I got something out of it oh thank God holy [__] a few moments later now comes the exciting bit we get to see what graphics card we got let's see what did we get okay it's a 10 gig 3080. um that's not too bad and in all fairness people have spent a lot more money on a 3080 so like it it could have been so much worse but it got even better because I decided to test a 5000 series ryzen CPU because I don't know maybe Alienware bioses are weird and lo and behold when I dropped a 5900x into the Alienware system no way it boots with the 5900x in it at which point feeling quite Victorious I decided to drop the graphics card back into the system so that I could game on my newly resurrected Alienware [Music] wow the CPU is immediately not super happy 73 degrees Celsius isn't horrendous but considering that there's 13 utilization it it's not great look at that we're actually gaming on our stupid gamble all we had to do was add a CPU and now we have quite a powerful gaming system it has kind of filled the room with the scent of a heavily used gym bag but at least it's working it's noisy it's very Audible and actually it's an AIO right so it's gonna take it about about 15 or 20 minutes to heat the liquid up fully because it's like a 120 it's not a huge AIO shirt so it shouldn't take too long um but yeah let's give it a minute so I've been gaming for half an hour and the CPU has settled in at 82 degrees Celsius which is not great considering the noise the not very high load and the ambient temperature of 15 degrees Celsius even with the AIO upgrade this system has some serious jet engine tendencies in terms of GPU temperature though it's decent it's not hit 70 degrees Celsius yet so yeah that that chunky cooler does seem to be putting in some work so after all of that we got most of a smelly Alienware system it's still an Alienware system so you know there's that but it could have gone a whole lot worse and hey the thing I'm the most excited about are these sweet E-Waste peripherals anyway until the next video thank you for watching watching bye-bye [Music]",

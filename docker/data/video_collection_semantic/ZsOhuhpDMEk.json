    "transcript": "- Hey Jared, what does Wish rhyme with? Wish I had saved my money on \"Wishtery Tech!\" - [Jared] Did you just rhyme my wish with wish? - I answered my own joke. So, immediately, I'm seeing some sus things. A smart card reader. Is this just what you buy to skim credit cards? What the hell, $148 for a full laser show. I will get in trouble with this. Does anyone want a Bluetoote? (people laughing) Let's get that. - [Jared] A Bluetoote! - PS5, PS4, PS3, Switch controller. You had me at Bluetoote. Three-in-one USB earpick mini-camera endoscope. Blah! You know what I don't wanna see? The inside of my ears. - [Jared] Well, you don't have to put it in your body either. We can just use this for- - Stop, nope, please stop. - What? - Don't, don't, nope. - [Jared] Like finding screws that we lost in a PC? - What kind of metaphor are you talking about right now? - [Jared] This isn't a metaphor, I'm just saying, there's more than- - Finding screws, Jared? - [Jared] What, no! - [Austin] Portable neck fan, $12 for a fan that goes around your neck. - [Jared] I mean, think about those nights when you're gaming, you know? - Okay, what? A gaming night. - Now that you've started to- Hang on, I'm a little nervous. - Sure, please, tell me more about your late night gaming sessions, where your neck's getting a little sweaty. - [Jared] No, no, no, you know, it's just. I'm a gamer dad, like a normal dad, only much cooler. - That might be the lamest shirt I've ever seen in my life. (people laughing) Okay, this is actually something that looks totally legitimate. $306 for an Xbox Series S \"Fortnite\" and \"Rocket League\" bundle. Surely we can't get scammed by buying an Xbox on Wish. (gasps) Oh! This is nefarious! (record scratch) This is a power bank that has a little mini camera inside of it. So, there was a video we did a few years ago, where we bought a bunch of hidden cameras. We filled up Matt's apartment, and I tried to see if I could find them. And fun fact, I hardly found any of them, and I knew there were cameras, and I was actively looking. - [Jared] I can't think of any like legal reason- - [Austin] There's no legitimate, no. - [Jared] That you would need this. - No, no, no. It's creep town 9,000 and I will pass. I found the world's smallest magic eight ball. I don't think there's anything I can do besides add that to cart, that seems totally worth it. A mini electric iron, it's so cute. Are you trying to say that my shirt's wrinkly? - [Jared] No, no, no, you look great. - These are candles shaped like strawberries. - Tech! - Tech! (people laughing) - You know, the cool kids these days use those probe lenses that cost thousands of dollars, and get you beautiful shots. Well, today on \"Wishtery Tech,\" we've got the next best thing. A two-megapixel digital microscope for seven dollars. Marques, sorry, but we're replacing you, my friend. (upbeat funky music) Is this the Uber special? It's just a like organizer for the back of the car that has like your phone, your tablet, and drinks, and stuff. - [Jared] Dude, that's like the best road tripping accessory ever. - Yeah, but that assumes that I want people in my backseat. - [Jared] Well, what is, what? You got a four-door car, you gotta use all four doors. - Yeah, for people I like. (somber downbeat music) - Do you like me? (door beeps) (alarm blares) (Jared sniffles) My mom said she couldn't pick me up. - I wish that I had chosen better items, but it is now a month and a half later. My \"Wishtery Tech\" is here and ready to go. (box thumps) That's a very big, heavy box. Inside box number one is, oh, the Xbox. That was anti climactic. Did we not get scammed? (dramatic orchestral music) - [Jared] No, we didn't! - I didn't think I just said the words without appreciating the gravity of the situation. - It's still- - It could be rocks, right, yeah, yeah, no, no, no. Let's calm down, let's not get too excited. (box rattling) - Significantly more moving- - Yeah, yeah. - [Speaker] Than a normal Xbox box. - [Jared] Better be legit, you paid $306 for it. - Now you're making me nervous. All I know is this seems to be an authentic item. Surely there's a real Xbox in here, and not a rock. I mean, I will say, this is looking a little beat up, but authentic. If this is a fake, I would be very surprised. - [Ken] No, I don't think we're doubting that it's a real box. - [Matt] We're doubting that there's real stuff inside. - [Ken] I wouldn't be surprised if someone resealed it. - There's so much suspense right now. Edit team, cut the dramatic music, okay? This is an authentic legitimate Xbox Series S that I got on Wish.com for a very reasonable price. And here's the proof. Power your dreams, (no audio)! - (laughs) That's aggresive. - Power your- It's sealed! I'm telling you, man. - Okay, okay, okay. - Look at this beautiful, pristine, just the ways. Almost beautiful, not pristine- - No, hold on- - Like I said, at best, this is a used console. - It's slightly scuffed, it's still new. It's fine! And HDMI. - Wow. Wait, no, this was repackaged. - It's not repackaged, stop it! - You know, this is a return. - Yep. - It's not a return! - [Matt] This is definitely a return. - Stop lying to me. You're stressing me out, okay? - But there's a dent on it! - Oh, wait, Matt. - It came off! - It came off. - There's nothing to see here, friends, the Xbox- - [Matt] We can do a drop test for it. - Series S. - Wow! - Authentic, verified, legitimate, Wish.com. Victorious, we move on to the next item. Filled with hubris, confidence, Jared, please. - [Jared] Time to put you in your place. (bag rustles) - [Ken] Is it a muzzle? - Aw man, I forgot I ordered this. This is Austin regretting his decisions. Those look like electrical things! - [Matt] Take it off, boy! This is flashbacks to that This Is episode. Do I get to slap that on you again? - Matt, what if you take your shirt off, actually? That seems like a better idea. - (laughs) Absolutely not. Take it off, boy. - Where am I gonna put the mic though? - I think you just clipped it onto your chest hair. - [Ken] What chest hair are you thinking? (Austin laughs) - He had a couple. - I feel judged right now. (tape clunks) - [Ken] Oh, I appreciate you got the white one. We definitely won't see it now. (crew laughing) - You know, sometimes people ask me, do I like my job? - [Ken] is one of those days where you could say yes. - The things I do for videos. - So, we got three here. - Oh my God. - [Matt] So, we can do. - Matt, can you just get it over with? Ugh, no, no, no, it's not centered! Oh, you're gonna get my bellybutton, Matt! Oh. - It's not sticking! - Oh. - All right, we're gonna do this one first. We'll start at one. - Okay. There we go, okay, so, look at my arm right now. I am doing nothing. That is literally the electric signals. I'm not doing that. - Hmm. - Ah, ah! (crew laughing) - It started on two on its own. I didn't do that one. - I am not moving either hand right now. - [Ken] It's just a natural pulse, right? Because of the electricity. - Yeah. - I am completely not doing anything. - [Matt] And that's only at a two. - It's not even fully on, it's like coming off. - [Ken] Your Apple Watch must be having a seizure right now. - Do you see this, look. (crew laughing) Ah, hah, that hurts! Holy (no audio), that hurts! (Austin bellows and laughs) - [Ken] Take it off, take it off, take it off, take it off, take it off. - No, I need four, give me four, dammit! - [Ken] No, ah, no! - Look, look- (Austin bellows) We have the segment, we're good now. (crew laughing) - It's very hard to turn off when his arm is just flailing. I still say you could've clipped. - [Joanna] Austin, we forgot to hit record anyway, we're done with this. (Matt laughing) - You know what? This has been a roller coaster of an episode, and I need a pick me up. I need something to really revitalize my spirit. Oh, this is a fake Apple Watch, oh. If you look at it, it looks like a regular Apple Watch. It's got a little like plastic on it, you flip it over, it's got all your sensors. Take a look at the crown. Do you see how much this crown wiggles? Listen to this. (crown clicking) That's the sound of the crown. - [Matt] That's oddly poetic. - [Austin] How much was this fake Apple Watch? - So, this was six bucks. (cash register chimes) - That's like one fifth of a band for a real Apple Watch. - Let's say in a hypothetical world, this thing right here doesn't work. - Yeah, yep. - Yeet! - You just want the band? - I mean. - Six dollars, no, but there's also a watch here, six bucks. (crew laughing) - Look at all the features that they give you. Message, heart rate. You can put your SIM card in this. - 81 BPM, and like, it also gave me like my blood pressure, and my pulse ox. There's no way. Yeah, my, it's actually 66. This is complete nonsense, this is not a real heart rate sensor at all. Oh, for the record, this screen is terrible. It actually looks a lot better on camera than it really is. This video is sponsored by ZipRecruiter.

(hands tapping) This is veinless hanging neck fan from a cool summer. Summer wind. (laughs) That's what they call me. Oh my God, wait a minute! Jared, how much is this? - [Jared] $17 and 10 cents - Worth it, USB-C. - Really? - Really? Oh my God. - I wish I had bought more. 'Cause it's getting a little hot in here, and it's kind of rude that you didn't buy one for everyone. (fan clicking) - [Ken] That sounds like my bones at six AM. - Oh, wait, it actually like- - Oh, okay. - Will stay. - [Matt] Okay. Do you feel cool? You don't look it, but like- - I'm not gonna lie, it's a nice little breeze directly on my face. This actually works. - [Matt] I'll say it's loud. - Ah. (fan humming) it's also a white noise generator. Sometimes on \"Wishtery Tech-\" - [Ken] Where are you putting that bro? (crew laughing) - Oh no, stop. - Sometimes on \"Wishtery Tech-\" - Somehow, that's not better. - Things just work out. Okay, inside here we have. - [Ken] Is that a light? - This go up your butt? (laughs) - [Ken] Why did your brain go to that? - Oh, it's an ear cleaning device. Well, it looks like it's a- - Oh, that's even worse. - You get a USB-C to A, and a micro B to A adapter for a dollar 74, and a light you can stick up an orifice. It's great. Ah, we got the light! - [Ken] (gasps) Yo! - All right, we now have a live video feed from this dollar 70 camera. (Ken laughs) - Hi! This is how I'm gonna shoot my vlogs from now on. Coming at you from Disneyland. - It's like some horrible found footage movie. Oh, you're going straight in. Oh! (Ken laughs) Ken, clean your ears! Oh! - Well, it's very hot. What about the Apple Watch? - [Austin] Yo, this actually works as a macro lens. - No, no, no, no, no- - Oh no. - Hi friends. - Guys. (crew laughing) - Welcome to an avant garde shot. - Avant garde. (laughs) A journey to center of Austin's nose. Oh, oh! - Oh! - Oh, Jesus! This is really (no audio) gross, but for a dollar 75, we already bought ourselves $10 worth of enjoyment. Wait, ah! - Oh no! - POV, you are the Chipotle from two hours ago. (everyone laughing) This is the grossest episode of \"Wishtery Tech\" ever, Jesus Christ. - [Austin] This is so good though! - No, no, no, no, no, no, no! (Austin laughing) We're gonna stop it right there. - [Austin] I have never been this happy with an episode of \"Wishtery Tech.\" - [Jared] Now that we know your ears are all clean. - Well, I was cleaning something else, but. - [Jared] But. - Original high quality best accessories. I'll be the judge of that. It's the Wish mating call. (headphones clicking) - That- - Little baby Wish products are born - [Matt] There's a lot of things we could say right now, but- (horn honks) (crew laughing) - Joanna! - [Joanna] I'm just doing what I'm told! - They've got like these little, like, extra drivers on the outside. I mean, they feel cheap, but they also have like an inline mic, it seems like. How much are these very, very cheap headphones? - [Jared] These were a dollar and 30 cents. - What is going on? Is Wish okay? I don't think I've ever had this many good items. - [Matt] You haven't tested it yet. - This could be worth a dollar. - [Matt] It could be, but you should test it. - [Ken] Is it the drivers moving around? - Yes. - [Matt] It's called active noise cancellation. - I mean, these fit horribly in my ears. Oh, wow, you know what? Yeah, the drivers are moving. When I talk, I almost hear the headphones vibrate a little bit. Top five worst headphones I've ever heard. (box clicks) - [Ken] Whoa, that's heavy. - You almost assaulted this Asus Zephyrus G14. This is the Jelly Comb laptop tablet holder. - [Ken] Oh, this, some assembly required, it looks like. - [Matt] No, this is gonna fold out like a Transformer, but it's gonna creak like hell. - [Ken] Oh, that's kinda neat. - And so, the Zephyrus goes on here. I'll put Z Flip on one side, Z Flip! - Yo, this is the streamer setup right here, guys. So, you get OBS on your computer. - Sure, sure, sure. - Right, right, right. Let's take off this garbage. Let's remove this. - Garbage, he says. - And bam! - Wow! - You get your V-Tuber on the side, you have your chat on that side. Oh my God, it's perfect. - Hey Ken, I'm not sure if you're familiar, multiple monitors exists. - What? More than one? - Yeah. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. - [Austin] How much was this? - This was $12.15. (cash register chimes) - Oh my God. - And that' pretty good. - A steal. - This is $12 for the quality, the plastic is actually fairly durable. But the main thing I don't like is there are the phone mounts. They don't come out far enough, and your laptop covers them. Like, that's the part it's not- - Beggars can't be choosers, Austin, look at this. Look how small this goes! That is tiny. - Wish, you're doing okay today. (package rustles) I got it. (package rattles) - [Matt] Lincoln Logs! - Digital microscope? - Wait. - Is this for non-orifices? I think. (Austin and crew laugh) Okay, so, we ordered a bunch of stuff, including these, which I'm gonna take a look at in a second. And this microscope was one of the things that I was excited for here. Look, here's my magnifier, all right? Ready? Ohp. Ohp! Magnified. Also, look at this! They come with C and micro USB adapters in this too. Metal adapters. (adapters clicking) - [Ken] Wait, so how much was this? - [Jared] So, this was six, I'm sorry, $14. - I'm gonna zoom in on the table, you know? - [Ken] Tell me when you see the termites. - Oh, oh, oh, oh, there we go. Look at the detail on the wood. All right, here, lemme pull a Z Flip, lemme pull a Z Flip out. - [Ken] Well, I got a better one for you, hold on. - Oh, that is a good one. - Tell me if this is a PSA 10. - PSA 10 \"Pokemon\" card coming right up. So, I'm gonna zoom in. - [Ken] Oh wow. - Wow! So that's what it takes to make yellow. I wish I could keep it stil, but unfortunately, this tripod is really bad. There we go, there we go. - [Ken] Oh, look at that. Oh yeah, look at that. - [Austin] That is neat! - [Jared] Is this a textured card? - No. - This is not a textured card, no, this is just a regular card. - [Ken] That's just how the printing is. - Let's look at what the Z Flip screen looks like. I bet this is actually gonna be pretty cool. Look at that, wow! - Oh! - So, you can see the individual OLED, so you can see the matrix here where you see the red, and the green, and as I swipe around- - [Ken] You could see in the OLED too, like, how certain pixels will just go dimmer. - [Austin] That looks rad! - [Ken] That's the percentage, right? And a little bit of dirt - Dude, how much was this again? - [Jared] This is $14. - This is actually like a high quality microscope, considering what it is. Actually very impressive. I am so happy with this episode, it's so cool! So these, I remember these. These are some of the world's smallest items. This is the world's smallest eight ball. - That's a lot of excess packaging for the world's smallest thing. - Someone ask the magic eight ball a question. - [Jared] Will I get a raise this year? - (laughs) The answer's no. Anyone else have a question? (crew laughing) - Will Jared get a raise this year? (light playful music) (Ken and crew laughing) - While you eight ball it, I would like to take a look to see what we've got here, which is the world's smallest ShopVac. So, we all make messes sometimes. And we all get into trouble in ways that we probably shouldn't. And so, with the world's smallest ShopVac, you can vacuum up your Cheeto dust. - Or Grandma Agnes. - If you guys, you can see, if I open up the top, it actually has like a filter and everything. Like, this is an actual, real vacuum. - It has a filter? - Yeah, right there. (ShopVac hums) - [Ken] That's like a micro tremor. Is that pulling on your face? Really? And you're doing something. - I mean, it's a very light amount of suck. - [Ken] Stuart Little can clean his apartment. - [Matt] Do you know if Stuart Little's actually a human? - Are you insinuating that I make a mess on purpose, Jared? - Well, you're supposed to- - You crush it, crush it in the bag, oh my. - [Austin] Those chunks are still larger than the actual vacuum. - [Ken] You're supposed to cut it with the razor blade before you do the line. But how much did the vacuum actually grab? - I don't know, let's find out. I don't think a lot. Nothing. - [Ken] We get it, you game. (Austin laughs)",

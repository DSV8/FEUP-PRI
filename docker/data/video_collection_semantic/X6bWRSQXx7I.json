    "transcript": "We've diagnosed a plethora of issues in our fixer flop playlist if you haven't heard of that playlist you are missing out it'll be linked below if you want to check it out but one of the more common themes that i've seen from folks who are inquiring about having their system fixed for free is overheating my cpu temps are running way too high and i don't know how to fix them i've checked all my fans are turning and no matter what i do my cpu temps reach crazy high temperatures and then the system shuts off or blue screens neither of those things is particularly fun the blue screen of death when i'd be a bit more afraid of just personally because i hate troubleshooting software and a lot of times software causes blue screens of death or software conflicts i should say but when it comes to system straight up overheating a lot of times if you have an aio it's because the pump died and in this video i'm going to show you what happens when the pump dies so that if this happens to you in the future you'll know how to properly diagnose it stay with me to get rid of that annoying windows activation watermark hop on over to vip SCD-Key where you can purchase a windows 10 OEM key for a fraction of the price of retail just use the secure payment method like Paypal enter the product key in your pc settings and say bye bye to the watermark and be sure to use our offer code SKGS for a special eleven eleven discount of thirty percent so let's jump right into symptoms that you might see and then i'll show you firsthand what happens when you disconnect the pump i'll use the system for demonstration purposes so when your system gets too hot and this could be a result of a number of things not just if your pump dies maybe you don't have good air flow maybe your case is just a hot box it doesn't really matter the point is if your cpu approaches t junction typically it's between 95 and 105 degrees celsius the computer will shut itself off in an effort to preserve itself it's like a last ditch kind of last resort effort to save vital components including the cpu and the motherboard which could potentially die with it and even the power supply we really should be happy that these safety nets are in place a lot of older pcs didn't have these fail safes and as a result their platforms would literally cook themselves to death you could fry eggs on cpus easy no problem just like weld a little pan to the top of the ihs and there you go you can cook breakfast but nowadays a lot of these systems won't let you do that at least with temperatures that are desirable for cooking eggs in fact there are even ways to disable t-junction which i won't go into in this video because you don't need to know how to do that there's absolutely no reason why your cp should ever reach above that temperature it will only do harm not good so with that i'm going to simply disconnect the pump leave the t-junction parameters in place and watch what happens and you guys are going to follow along for the ride so if this ever happens to you again you'll be able to kind of just yeah that's that's exactly what my system is doing you know what i think i have a dead pump there you go i saved you hours of troubleshooting i've been there done that i don't want anyone else to go through that so to kick things off let's start with a control this system houses a Ryzen 5 2600 a b450 or a b5d mother but i'm not really sure it doesn't really matter though everything's running its stock i do have docp enabled so we're running at a higher clocked memory than base at 21 33 megahertz and obviously the AIO in here is a 120 mil this is from Ddeepcool now i'm not tweaking fan curves i'm not changing again vcore or anything like that i'm just leaving this stock a lot of folks build their systems don't hop into the bios and change a bunch of things even though there are some benefits uh doing that obviously enabling docp or xmp uh maybe tweaking Vcore if your motherboard's just dumping a ton of voltage it doesn't need to into your chip so there are some things in there that you probably do want to mess with but more often than not folks who are maybe first or second time builders just don't know really what they're doing so they tend to stay away from the bios or UEFI so that's what i've attempted to replicate here just a system that i built kind of from scratch and it you know it just works it powers on we loaded up windows and there you go so what i did was download it 64 engineer if you're not aware of what ida 64 is it's a great software uh for just pretty much anything diagnostics troubleshooting can do temperature tests burns things like that it's not as heavy as prime95 in fact nowhere close to it but if you want to do some kind of long-term cpu stability testing you can do that in 964 and that's what you're seeing here with this chart so the temperature with the pump running appropriately with just a default fan curve you can see never really touched 70 degrees celsius stayed in the mid 60s which makes sense for a 2600 very low TDP it's a very uh efficient chip in that regard and 120 million is just it's fine for it right nothing out of the ordinary here now it's important that we let this test run for 30 minutes at least i'd say for larger AIO is probably an hour you can see this one's pretty much flatlined after about 10 minutes or so but i always like to let it stretch out to 30 at the minimum when it comes to liquid cooling because water has a higher heat capacity than most metals used in air tower coolers and as a result of that you usually need to wait a bit longer for that water to equalize to the heat output being dumped by the cpu so yeah and again mid 60s looking pretty good here and we're going to do the exact same thing or attempt to run this test for the exact same amount of time without the pump running and i can already tell you again from experience that this is not going to end well so as you can see in the graph we've allowed temperatures to return to idle around 30 degrees celsius that means that the fluid in this loop has again kind of equalized to atmospheric temperature what i'm going to do is simply disconnect the pump cable which is powered and actually powered through the cable itself sometimes you'll find like SATA or molex power for these pumps that's just separate power sometimes you need to connect a proprietary connector a lot of course their aos are like that so it really depends on the unit but in this case the pump is being powered directly through the pump cable so yeah what we're going to see here are temperatures steadily climbing we are at idle here apart from ida 64 being open and a few other background tasks this system is under no sustained heavy load at all and temperatures will probably still slightly increase over time and the reason why is because all the heat being kept here is not being circulated to the radiator so picture this like its own kind of stand-alone tower maybe an aluminum tower and there's no fan attached to it right so all that heat is just building up here and it's not being transported where it needs to be transported for active cooling with this fan that's not good what i'm going to do is put the side panel back on to simulate real-world use and we'll see what happens now by looking at this graph can you tell where i disconnected the pump it should be pretty obvious this is with the pump on this was about a 20 minute or so gap here and then you can see how temperatures immediately started climbing and they will continue to do so until i imagine the cpu overheats in the seat and the system shuts down this is a very common dead pump symptom now while this test is running there is another easy way to tell if a pump is dead obviously you can check temperatures if they continue to climb especially at idle that's a that's a bad sign it means that you probably didn't see the AIO properly maybe the block isn't making proper contact with the IHS or maybe you forgot to use thermal paste or forgot to remove the plastic covering on the bottom side of the the block over the cold plate or maybe the pump is dead right but an easy way to tell that the pump is dead is by grabbing the tubes okay if you have an AIO that's working just fine right now grab the tubes and try to remember what that feels like you got that fluid churning through them and that little vibration there that you're picking up is a good sign if you grab these tubes at some point and you don't feel those vibrations when of course your system is on because the pump has to be turning for this to work then that means that your pump is dead so memorize that feeling now if you have an AIO just store it somewhere in your head and then if you ever notice that cpu temps just continue to climb and never really stop until your system shuts down just grab the tubes it's an easy way to troubleshoot whether or not your pump is dead now back to our test bed you can see temperatures have continued to climb you would think that just by looking at this chart we were under some kind of heavy load but we haven't even started the stability test in ida 64 yet this system is essentially at idle but you'd think we were under load based on how crazy these temperatures have behaved and another thing don't be fooled by the fans in your system at this point the fan attached to the radiator here is just churning the rpm is very high much higher than what it was at at idle even though we're still at idle but the air back here i'm putting my hand behind the radiator this air is at room temperature that should not be the case if the pump was properly moving the heat from the source to the radiator where it is essentially convected to atmosphere we'd be feeling heat back here but this is literally just it's it's room temperature that's not good another way to tell that your pump is bad so we can simply let these temperatures continue to climb while the system is at idle and it might take several minutes especially with the 2600 because again the TDP is fairly low we're not dumping a ton of heat at idle but what we're going to go ahead and do is stop this test allow fluid temps to return to room temperature thereabouts and then turn on uh the stability test we're gonna click the start button on the bottom left of the screen and allow the temps to just skyrocket it's not gonna be pretty so here we go we just disconnected the pump again after temperatures had flat lined and we're going to start the stability test this is not not going to be good okay here we go oh boy i'm not liking this really hoping i don't permanently damage the cpu okay it's continuing to rise fans are pretty much max speed we're at 90 degrees celsius 101 degrees celsius so the system is actually um it's still still going it's kind of funny but i think it is throttling itself fairly hard what are we at here cpu frequency is what i want and uh yeah current frequency 500 megahertz that's what we're at right now folks 500 megahertz for comparison the standard clock speed of this chip is somewhere around 3 to point five ish gigahertz so we're not even we're right around like yeah like half of one gigahertz that's pretty awful okay yeah we are sustained at over 100 degrees celsius now system still hasn't shut off yet i'm kind of surprised i know intel at this point would have definitely shut off but AMD is just throttling back frequency it's trying to keep the system on at least somewhat functional but again 500 megahertz is just that's an abysmal clock speed and that there is t-junction this is yep 106. okay all right i'm calling it i don't know why it's not shutting off it should be shutting off right now but these temperatures are just yeah these temperatures are bad okay all right i think i think we made a we made our point and would you look at that just as quickly as the cp heated up the temperature also dipped at about the same rate once we reconnected the pump and shut off the stress test so that's a very very quick recovery but at the same time you just you never want to see your temperatures reach triple digits in in celsius at least if you're measuring in fahrenheit i'm sure triple digits can be just fine but 100 degrees celsius is no bueno for most if not all modern consumer desktop chips another cool thing to show you i took my floor imaging camera to the AIO both with the pump disconnected simulating a dead pump scenario and with the pump connected and functioning properly you can see that on the left with the pump not working that a lot of heat is built up in just one tube and especially under the cpu block and it's kind of hard to see under the block itself this is just mapping surface temperature here so the the plastic basically comprising the cpu block is not very hot but under that i can assure you it is extremely toasty and one of the tubes is also very hot this i imagine leads directly into the fin stack where the fluid would kind of pick up the heat and then pull it to the radiator it's not good to see something like this where you've got heat just soaking one side of a closed system if the pump was functioning properly you'd see what we see on the right picture here where you really have an even distribution of heat over time now you could see a small um you know maybe one tube is a bit hotter than the other especially in longer systems we're getting tons of heat dumped into the system you can see this in car radiators especially but in a very small build like this even under idle conditions which this photo was taken at idle um you shouldn't be seeing all that heat pent up on one side well that was a bit unexpected i guess i'm a bit more experienced with overheating when it comes to more modern intel chips Ryzen tends to not be that hot but anyway i hope that this at least gets the point across when it comes to overheating cpus and potentially like motherboards overheating and other things that are next to the cpu could be a dead pump and there are easy ways to check just grab the tubes you can feel the pump churning fluid in there that's a good sign otherwise if your system is randomly shutting off in the middle of especially heavy gaming and other scenarios like that or even at idle after i've heard it happen after a few seconds because sometimes when when the system starts up the cp is under a bit of a load um even that could cause the system to immediately shut back off again in an effort to save itself check the pump check the fluid churning in the pump itself if you can get into your desktop check temperatures if they keep rising yeah you've probably got a dead pump if you're rocking an aio with that if you enjoyed this fun little video be sure to let me know give this one a thumbs up i appreciate that you know sometimes it's better to just like kill two birds with one stone by making a video like this when i come across scenarios and the email chains of email threads that i get from folks inquiring about participating in the fix or flop playlist a lot of them that have overheating issues usually i just tell them to check the pump and that ends up being the issue so instead of just seeing so many of those over and over this one video i hope should suffice and uh what i'll end up doing if i suspect that's to blame is link those folks this video here and maybe it'll point them in the right direction with that uh consider leaving a

    "transcript": "The original AirPods released nearly five years ago as an answer to the courageous elimination of the headphone jack on the iPhone 7. What was originally criticized for its price, memed for its looks, and mocked for [lacking a wire connecting the two buds together (yeah, that was a thing at the time and it was a real complaint), AirPods was one of the first players in the true wireless earbuds market and they inarguably nailed it. The proof of that isn't just that they were sold out for nearly two years straight despite moving over 50 million units, no, proof they nailed it was that they continue to sell today what is essentially the same earbud; 5 years later! And it's no wondering why people like them: the ease of pairing, battery life, convenience, and reliability still put them near the front of the pack; however, they never grabbed me, a chronically diagnosed audiophile. And it wasn't until the AirPods Pro and subsequent AirPods Max that I conceded fidelity for the convenience that the AirPods line offered. But Apple hasn't forgotten the earbud that made them, it seems, and the new AirPods 3rd Generation now retail for $179. Of course, the question is are the changes made good ones and are they worth the price? Well, todays sponsor, EcoFlow, and their new River Mini power station certainly is! EcoFlow makes power stations large and small from ones that can power your hometo, well, this. The River mini is their newest, smallest unit yet and it can power 90% of consumer electronic, like the new MacBook Pro over the built in 100W USB-C PD port, the AirPods 3 or your phone on the Qi wireless charger, and over the built in AC inverter, lots of other stuff. It is capable of recharging to 80% in just 1 hour and can be charged over AC, a cars DC power, or even a solar panel. The thing is lightweight at just 6 lbs, and packs 210Wh of juice. They have an awesome app that allows you to get real-time information as well as modify certain settings (pause) like enabling the X-Boost which allows for double the AC power output. This thing can power tons of stuff conveniently and Ive been using mine everywherethe newest member of the RIVER family, the RIVER mini, is a great addition to your home when you need a smaller power source. Head to my link in the description to check it out. The new AirPods 3 look more like their pricier sibling, the AirPods Pro than they do their predecessor. Gone is the classic vertical charging case in favor of the wide one found on the Pros; however, the new AirPods charging case does find itself with a smaller footprint than that of the pricier earbuds, despite offering six hours more total listening time. Another feature not found on AirPods Pro? MagSafe compatibility. The new case isnt super MagSafe-y with just 4 magnetsone in each cornerbut it does indeed snap onto the MagSafe puck with a bit of encouragement and roughly centered alignment; of course, it also works with non-magnetic Qi wireless charging mats. Unlike the prior generation, this wireless charging case is not an additional charge is and included at the $180 price point. The design of the earbuds themselves mimic the AirPods Pro as well with an even more aggressive insertion angle. Comfort and fit is of course, subjective, and just as the original AirPods and AirPods Pro were not a catch-all, these are certainly not going to be either; however, the new contoured design offers a few objective improvements for *most* ears. First, the angle of the driver aligns with a greater number of ear canals providing a better natural seal and improved bass response. Secondly, the wishbone design balances the weight far more than the prior AirPods moving mass away from the stems and placing the majority of the load inside the ears' concha. And while not everyone's experience will align with mineReddit is already filled with a bunch of people that say this design is a regressionI (along with a few other people that tried these very buds) find that they're the most comfortable of any AirPods models to dateperiod. I have very small ears and ear canals so I get discomforted by crap lodged in there after usually just an hourit's why I most typically wear over-ear headphones. Discomfort never came with AirPods 3 and I forgot they were even there on multiple occasions. I will remark that the shorter stem, which adopts the force sensor from AirPods Pro (gone is the awful eardrum tapping required previously) seems to point into the cheek for most peoplecertainly myselfand is therefore a bit trickier to engage. Of course, comfort means little if the AirPods sound crappy, so well how do they sound? I felt I needed a baseline, so I went out and bought a brand new set of 2nd generation AirPods to make the most direct and fair comparisons possibleafter all, Apple does still sell these for $129 so theyre very much competition. And just as I remember, theyre not very good. Their loose canal fit makes for an extremely weak low-end (and thats coming from someone who doesnt even really love bass). Conversely, the other side of the spectrum is overly bright nearing on sibilance. They have no noise isolation whatsoever but also no soundstage. Theyre frankly bad. That sets the bar pretty low for the AirPods 3, but I have to say. wow! Im impressed how much better they are. The frequency response is very inoffensive. The bass is surprisingly prominent for earbuds that dont establish a seal with your canal, but theyre not overpowering and they remain quick and controlled. The mids are very lush with vocals in particular showing nice separation from instrumentation, and the high-frequencies are surprisingly punchy, but without being too bright like the AirPods 2. Obviously their isolation is poor relative to the AirPods Pro (you will still hear people around you and people nearby will also hear what youre listening to), but they isolate way better than the AirPods 2 and manage to do so sounding more open. Imaging and soundstage is much improved. A big pitch from Apple for these was Spatial Audio via Dolby Atmos. Im, frankly not a fan of Atmos on higher-end headphones, but on the AirPods 3 these audio processing tricks can occasionally make the AirPods sound better than they really are. For example, in Michael Kiwanukas You Aint the Problem, the background crowd stands out from the rest of the track and the whole recording feels very dimensional with Michaels vocals shining through with excellent separation and with more weight than the instrumental. But not every track is a hit. Marinas Venus Fly Trap pushes the singers vocals underwater with sluggish bass and an extremely thin high-end. It sounds legitimately very bad. So, its still a bit of a wash with Atmos tracks, but I do feel that more are getting better which is good. I think Spatial Audio is much more effective in movie and TV content howevertheres generally better mastering and vocals dont tent to get pushed to the background like they can in music. I had a lot of fun watching content on Apple TV+ with these even with the kinda gimmicky stuff like head tracking disabled. So, I guess the questions is are the AirPods 3 worth $180? In a vacuum, Id be inclined to say yes theyre very competent and certainly the best variant of the standard AirPodsa huge jump from the second generation. But these dont exist in a vacuumand while the new AirPods 3 are good, the older AirPods Pro are great. The sonic performance is quite a bit better and then you have the entire ANC capabilities which in my eyes, is an enormous asset. And while the MSRP of the AirPods Pro is high, the going rate now is seldom more than $20 extra than the AirPods 3and on discount days, Ive seen the AirPods Pro sell for even less than the AirPods 3. And with competition that close in price, AirPods 3 become significantly less appealing. So my suggestion is this only buy AirPods 3 if the AirPods Pro dont fit in your earsthats literally the only reason to choose themwhich is too bad because theyre really excellent otherwise. Maybe if they were $150 or less, the story would change, but theyre not. So I cant recommend them. What I can recommend is some merchandise from our friends at LTTstore.com!",

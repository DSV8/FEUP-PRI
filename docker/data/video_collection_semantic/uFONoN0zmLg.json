    "description": "The Apple AirPods and the Apple Lightning headphones that are included with every new iPhone 7 look very similar. Obviously one is wireless, and one has a cord (although with no headphone jack attached) But which one has the better internal speaker? Its time to find out!   Its interesting to see the differences in cone design and material. As well as the internal magnet size and copper coil dimensions.

    "transcript": "I have in front of me a brand new pair of Apple Airpods. I also have the remains of Whats Insides Airpods that they demolished on their own channel. And I dont know about you guys, but I would much rather analyze whats left of the Whats Insides Airpods, and giveaway my brand new set to one of you. So stick around to the end of the video to see how to win. Lets get started. [Intro] The unfortunate thing about the Apple Airpods is that once theyve been taken apart they can never be put back together again. So Im glad I dont have to destroy another pair; that would be unnecessary. This is the left over Airpod that Whats Inside did not destroy and I can see a faint seam around the head of the speaker, and thats where Ill start my attack. While the Airpods might look like a glorified Q-Tip in a dental floss container, theres actually some interesting technology inside. Remember that water resistant screen that covers the ports on the iPhone 7? That same type of screen is found here, inside the Airpods. It lets sound and air pass through, but not liquid. It helps the Airpods stay water resistant. The proximity sensor ribbon did get torn completely in half when I ripped off that outer shell. See what I mean by non-repairable? And now for the good stuff. This is the actual speaker inside of the Airpods. The first thing that stands out to me is the clear speaker cone made out of smooth, flexible, rubber-like material. Lets compare it to the speaker inside the regular corded headphones that are included inside every new iPhone 7 box. I would recommend against applying pressure with a razor blade in such close proximity to your finger tips, but just remember, I am a professional. The wired ear phones are definitely easier to get inside and I can already see the difference with the speaker cone, instead of the smooth rubber cone of the Airpods. This has more of a plastic feel to it. The textured ripples are noticeably different. The cone material doesnt matter a whole lot though. For a speaker this size, the sound difference between materials would be minimal. Both materials are water resistant, unlike a paper or cardboard cone found in some car audio speakers. For a speaker this size, the sound difference between materials would be minimal. Underneath that cone though lies something more important: the magnets. The regular corded Apple headphones have a copper coil diameter of 7 millimeters, while the coil of the Apple wireless Airpods have 7.5 in diameter. This means that the electromagnet inside the Airpod is slightly larger than the magnet inside the corded headphones. A larger magnet means a more powerful speaker. Obviously the .5 millimeter difference is extremely small and the average person wont notice any major differencesbut its still interesting to see. The copper coil from the regular iPhone 7 headphones can fit inside the coil from the Airpods. So if youre the type of person that needs every half millimeter you can get, Airpods are probably the headphones for you. Just for kicks and giggles Ill open up the shaft of the Airpods. This allows the metal charging tip on the bottom to come loose and the inner battery can be exposed. Most everyone I know who owns these Airpods and uses them says good things about them. So whoever wins the brand new set of Airpods is going to be lucky indeed. Ill include a Gleam link in the description of this video where you can enter into the contest. Ive included Whats Inside social media in the giveaway, since without them this free pair of Airpods wouldnt be possible. The Airpods do work with Android phones as well so everyone can enter into the giveaway. Hit that thumbs up if you like seeing tech reviewed from the inside, and Ill continue to make videos like this in the future. Thanks a ton for watching. Ill see you around. And if youve made it this far in the video, hit me up with your favorite color in the comments. Lately my favorite color is red.",

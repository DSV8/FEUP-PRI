    "transcript": "- [James] Riley! (grunting sounds) - Ah, sorry, I was doing my cameo in the Spider-Man movie. Oh, you didn't get one? - [James] What? - Oh, the other James didn't get one, either. Franco. We're doing it this week on They're Just Movies, ah! Silicon Lottery, the company who found, certified, and sold specific CPU's with guaranteed high-performance, shut down a few months ago, but Intel may be finding a way to give you another chance at beating the house. Just so you know, statistically, you will not. A report indicates team blue will be releasing special, pre-binned core i9-12900KS chips with an all-core boost frequency of 5.2 gigahertz, 200 megahertz higher than their standard binned brethren. - [James] Your mom's standard binned. - Oh. (chuckles) I feel bad. And it's eight performance cores are expected to handle overclocking better as well. They're basically like the Spartans of chips. You ever played that game? Spartan? Spartan 2000? To be fair to Silicon Lottery, RIP, Intel has released higher clocked KS chips before, but the last one was the 9900KS back in 2019. So the timing seems a little insensitive. - [James] Too soon! - I mean, obviously, obviously not for whoever's going to drop $5,000 or whatever for this thing. They should be sitting at home, pouting. Like we are. It's only proper. The official Bitcoin wallet app in the world's first country to make cryptocurrency legal tender is enduring a flood of public complaints about identity theft and mysteriously disappearing funds. Thankfully, the ledger is public, so everyone can see just how badly the victims have been robbed. Wait, that doesn't help. The issues have eroded public sentiment in the country, whose crypto-bro president has seen the value of his investments dropped by nearly 6 million US dollars due to the recent fall in Bitcoin prices. Critics are also pointing out that government officials who are being sanctioned by the US for financial corruption have business ties to the official Chivo wallet, leading some to speculate that the whole \"Bitcoin as legal tender\" thing may have just been a ploy to launder money. The whole thing is a bit of a mess, which is really sad for the regular people of El Salvador who have been affected. - [James] They have diamond hands, though. - I mean, that won't help them at this point! The only thing that will help them is if they get this crypto volcano Bitcoin city project off the ground. I'm crossing my fingers. And there's a new entrant in the world of gaming laptops, LG, who has historically focused on portability rather than gaming performance. Personally, I take my washer-dryer combo everywhere. I'm going to my parents. They need my help. But LG's debutante looks like it's going to be no joke, with an RTX 3080 Max-Q GPU, an option for 32 gigabytes of RAM, and a 300 Hertz IPS display. It's also getting a USB 4 port, in case you've been wondering where the heck those are going to show up, as well as an ethernet port, though it's a tad heavy at nearly six pounds. - [James] That's a heavy port! - The ethernet port. (mimicking explosion noises) It's due out early next year, with LG saying more details will be coming at CES. Hey, you know, what's not coming to CES? LMG. Staying home this year, watching some Transformers. - [James] Michael Bay marathon! - It's been on my mind for some reason. I am not Omnicron. Now it's time for quick bits, brought to you by PebbleHost, provider of premium, dedicated servers at affordable pricing starting at just $39.99 US per month. They dedicate their life to you. PebbleHost has everything from power efficiency, to high performance Ryzen's, all located in the UK, with instant setup on in-stock systems. We're talking automated OS reinstalls with one click installations for Proxmox and cPanel, plus US and UK based 24/7 support. So check them out at the link below and the first 200 people to do so will get 50% off their first month with the code LTT. Look, don't try to understand. They're just quick bits. Amazon's ban on warehouse workers' phones was suspended during the pandemic and was due to resume next month. But after a warehouse in Illinois was hit by a tornado that claimed the lives of six people, employees have been understandably concerned about being able to communicate in emergencies. Under pressure, Amazon has now put its plans to reinstate the ban on indefinite hold. Stay tuned for when they decide you can use your phone within the new and improved sanity boxes. It's not exactly easy to find a place where it's legal to provide streams of pirated material, but you definitely shouldn't try it in Malaysia, as the country has recently upped the penalty for doing so to a maximum of 20 years. - [James] More like Lame-aysia. That was hard. Company managers could also be found guilty if they don't stop their employees from participating in such behavior, and I'm pretty sure the penalty wouldn't be house arrest at the Koala Loompour Four Seasons. In case you missed it, Disney and YouTube TV have resolved a carriage dispute that lasted a couple days, leaving sports fans in anguish. What's going to happen! YouTube TV customers lost the ESPN family of networks, a huge draw for many viewers, as well as FX, ABC, and other Disney channels, though they're all now back on the platform. Public disputes between content providers and streaming carriers have become increasingly common as the tech world fights to make sure the storied tradition of segmenting services into thousands of confusing price tiers is preserved. It's the holidays after all. What are we without traditions? If you've had trouble finding a new Xbox, it might make you feel a little better to see that during this chip shortage, not even Microsoft can get their hands on them. The company had to use dev kits instead of retail consoles to run a major Halo tournament over the weekend because of supply chain problems. It doesn't appear this affected the tournament that much, other than to save space by not using fridge-sized consoles. But if I were there, it would feel a little like trying to throw a sticky grenade and throwing a frag instead, like bounces right away. I look like an idiot right now! What is that guy doing? And scientists have taught a Petri dish of living cells to play the game Pong in just five minutes, guaranteed. The so-called dish brain is comprised of human brain cells and the scientific team used electrical impulses to tell the cells where the ball is so it could whack it like a paddle. - [James] I would have called it Dish Wash Dog. - Dish- dish dog. Dish brain isn't as good at the game as a proper AI, but if I know dish brain, I wouldn't give up on dish brain just yet. They've got some fire in them. I think dish brain could take it to the nationals. As long as ESPN is still around. Talking about dish brain! And you take yourself right out of here, but come back on Wednesday for more tech news, straight outta dish brain right here.",

    "transcript": "What's up guys, Lew here back with another video Today, it's all about the Galaxy Note 4 which I've been using for about a week Actually a little bit more Running it through various tests Testing the battery life, the camera performance I did an unboxing video as well as a 4K camera test You should go check out those videos If you're interested in this device But I've been receiving a huge number of requests Possibly from Apple fan boys Suggesting that I've been unfair In bend testing the iPhone 6 Plus But not doing the Note 4 yet And there are some questions in concerns with this device Even though it looks durable at first glance You have a brand new metallic exterior That you didn't have on Note 3 Now, the Note 3 on the other hand has this internal chassis With a plastic exterior and it did incredibly well in my bend test You can go check out that video through a link in the description It's one of the toughest devices that consumer reports tested as well Holding 150 pounds of force before completely giving in Where as the iPhone 6 for example is less than half that At 70 pounds of force, so a very durable device From that perspective but can Samsung keep it up with their latest Galaxy Note 4 Let's go ahead and do this test But before I do that I do wanna mention that of course don't do this yourself Do not attempt this at home that is not smart And on top of that, this is by no means the critical test to determine A phone's durability; It's a benchmark, it's just showing you that under the force of my hands, these things are capable of bending or not and for the people who are gonna go crazy suggesting that all will bend That is also not the case I have another link in the description to a much larger selections of devices That will are bent in one video Or attempted to be bent So yes, there is a benchmark, it's up here The Note 3 is at the top of it With a 150 pounds of force And let's find out where the new Note 4 fits into that scale Through once again the power, the pressure of these hands right here Alright so there you have it The Note 4 does bend a little bit And funny enough it is in the exact same spot As the 6 plus It's nowhere near as severe I just had a tiny little warp here And I had to put a lot of pressure into it to achieve that but still at that same amount of pressure The note 3 was completely fine Now, this tiny little warp might be able to be fixed Just by bending it back Let me go ahead and try that right now Do it live So yeah You can basically bend it back I think, yeah So there you go I guess in this particular case whatever material they are using Is a little bit more robust Or maybe it's an internal frame holding it together Could be the battery It will bend But not nearly as severely as the 6 Plus So can you bend any phone? Yes, of course at a certain amount of pressure every phone will bend The question here is how easily and how often And of course time will tell as people use these devices for more extended periods The purpose of these tests for all of you haters is to put these phones in an extreme condition For obvious reasons I can't test these things for 6 months and then tell you what happened in my pocket All I can do Is apply the force with the tools that I have available to me To give you potentially some insight into what it takes to achieve a bend in any of these phones And as you've seen in my previous bend tests which will be linked down in the description Each phone performs differently and that's the key characteristic I am really sick of these reports coming out saying Of course you idiot, why are you bending phones? That's not really the conversation here The conversation here is why are other devices engineered to specification higher than others Why? Why do that? If no phones ever bend, why can the Note 3 would stand a 150 pounds of force? Whereas other devices are less than half that? Oh, let me guess, they just had extra money to invest in durability? No! Because everybody's perception of what a durable phone is Is different and some manufacturers have specification here, others have it here And as we continue to miniaturize our devices We're gonna take it's durability So as mentioned before, these bend tests are not the \"Be All\" and \"End All\" of durability testing on a phone They are the far end of the spectrum, the extreme case But I can't possibly replicate 6 months. a year or 2 years of ownership in a quick video Or in a review video that comes out 2 weeks after the phone is out So, in some circumstances we have to push the boundaries Because you're gonna be the owner of these device for 2 years, maybe more And this is a significant investment for you, in some cases, close to a thousand dollars So, I can't see why having extra information to work with could possibly be a bad thing So if you appreciate this testing and me essentially sacrificing personal devices to get this info out to you Then please remember to leave a thumbs up down below And also chill out on the fan boy stuff in the comments, ok? This is all positive information for everyone and if anything is gonna lead to tougher devices in the future So there you have it Another bend test video in the books The Note 4 It can be bent, not very much, with a lot of force And then it can also be bent back without any real issue Regarding the integrity At least that's what I just found out right now Alright guys, that wraps this up Catch you on the next episode!",

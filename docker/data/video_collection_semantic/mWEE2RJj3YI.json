    "transcript": "- There are thousands of games, even entire genres that can only be played (hand tapping) on an old Windows 98 PC, like this one. But it sucks! It's big, it's loud, it's heavy. Unless I spend extra money, the most reliable way to transfer files to it is to burn a flippin' CD-R. But it's my only hope if I wanna share my favorite childhood games with my kids. (crickets chirping) Wait, what is this? Windows 98? Running on a modern computer? The hardware even all works. What sorcery is this? The kind that gives me confidence you are not gonna be able to navigate away while I tell you about our sponsor, Pulseway! Pulseway is a mobile first, remote monitoring and management tool that's built with MSPs and IT teams in mind. To learn more about how you can see and control your network from anywhere, check the link in the video description. While we won't be completely rid of our friend Scale here anytime soon, PC emulators, that is to say, software that emulates the hardware of a retro PC rather than emulating a retro game console, have gotten extremely good in the last couple of years. Now, there were already solutions to running older software. DOSBox and Windows Compatibility Mode come to mind, but this is different. PCem is an honest to goodness, we're even emulating the CPU and firmware solution that drastically improves software compatibility. Can your DOSBox do this? (Linus laughing) (Windows 98 startup jingle) I'm impressed that sound is working. And check this out! (Linus laughing excitedly) It's a whole working PC BIOS! There's not much we can do in here. I mean, even things we take for granted now, like overclocking, were not done in firmware in those days. It would've been, like, conductive pencil mods, replacing oscillators... - There were jumpers. - Jumpers, yeah, moving jumpers around on the motherboard. Now we're in Windows. I don't remember Process Explorer. This was an add-on or something, right? - [Anthony] Yeah, so this is a Sysinternals app. We actually have a video on that. Basically, this gives us a much better task manager experience. - [Linus] There was something that I would always do. Oh yeah, yeah, you have to go in here and you have to uncheck this. - You gotta be like, \"Oh, do you have a proxy? Ha-ha!\" - Yeah, it would make things really slow every single time you launched Internet Explorer. Speaking of which, obviously, Internet Explorer is not going to work, but we are on the network, are we? - [Anthony] Go to entire network. - [Linus] Ah, here we go. - [Anthony] What? - [Linus] No, we do not have an IP. How is it that Windows networking tools have actually gotten worse? - I know, right? - [Linus] The fact that this just has a release and renew button right there. - [Both] Renew. - [Linus] Hey, look at that! Here we go! - And check it out, all those familiar faces. - No way! Wait, can I just... Okay, well, it makes sense that Yvonne's workstation would not just let people browse it. Do I have- No, I don't have any shared anything. Okay, hold on, what about a NAS, though? - [Anthony] Well, the thing about- - Whoa! - I was going to say, the thing about Windows 98 is that it will use the login that you chose at the beginning for all of your logins for network places. So it probably wouldn't have worked, but this enables anonymous access, so it totally works. - [Linus] Can I just... No, not enough free disk space. - It's only an eight-gig disc. There you go. - [Linus] Okay. - I wasn't expecting that. Windows 98's file sharing is ancient. Most things don't support it. - I remember it being terrible. - [Anthony] Now this is with the unofficial service pack three, so it has, like, up-to-date stuff, but it's still a pain to get set up and it doesn't work with Windows 10, Windows 11. - Yeah, that's a Linux server that I was pulling files off of. - Yeah, because that was a Plex server, or whatever it was. - I'm RAID. - Yeah. - [Linus] Now as I mentioned, obviously Internet Explorer is completely unsupported on the modern web, but we can fire up Opera, which is still available for Windows 98 or, like... - This is a version of Opera that only really runs as a consequence of installing a package called Kernel X, which kind of emulates Windows 2000, so we're kind of multiple levels deep here. - I see. - That being said, not everything will work. HTTPS generally doesn't like to work. There are other browsers you can try, but you can also use the old web. - [Linus] Theoldnet.com. Okay. 1998. How have I never seen this before? This is amazing. - [Anthony] There it is. (Linus gasping) - PC97.com, baby! Netlink Computer Inc, your one-stop computer and internet store! The store that I used to work at, ncix.com, this was their original domain. Click here for more options. PC builder, that was my job! (Anthony laughing) Much later. The software that enables all of this, PCem, was originally written by Sarah Walker as an open-source project that, as we saw when we were booting it up, uses the original BIOS ROMs for old motherboards and GPUs to emulate the hardware in its entirety. And there is a shocking amount of hardware supported. Everything from the original IBM PC and plasma display luggables all the way to the Pentium II, with pretty much everything in between. And with support for a wide variety of both sound and video devices, some of which are really obscure. I think what's most impressive, though, is how easy it is to set up. The user interface is so intuitive that with no guidance whatsoever, I managed to stumble my way through it in about 15 minutes after which, I had my kids playing The Magic School Bus Explores the Solar System like it was 1994. I mean, it helps helps a little bit that I used Windows 98 back in the day, and I wrote down explicit instructions for how to use it on my underwear, which, by the way, is now available on lttstore.com with new patterns. Now, because it emulates the original hardware, and not just the environment like DOSBox does, you can run basically any software from the time period, including Windows and even alternative operating systems like OS/2 and BeOS, which has been nigh impossible to do up until now unless you used very old virtual machine software that provided virtual devices that were compatible with these old OSes. And even then, you're not running that old software on a brand new machine, which clearly isn't a problem here. On a 12900K, Anthony has set up a period-accurate Windows 98 SE virtual machine, complete with Pentium II CPU, 3DFX Voodoo3 GPU, and a sound card that can do EAX for the full WIN 98 experience. That's a really big deal because a lot of games in the Windows 98 era not only used 3D video acceleration, but also used audio acceleration to enhance the overall immersiveness, something that Windows Vista dropped support for entirely. It's time to play some games. Anthony, you didn't tell me we were gonna go off script because I have to play Road Rash! - I had to install all these games to test them and make sure that they all worked, you know? And as a little surprise, I guess I left them installed. - I'm so excited, I love Road Rash! Oh, I'm so excited. Road Rash, let's go! Oh, what you guys are looking at right now is how you put a disc into the drive. It just uses a virtual CD-ROM, so as long as you have those ISOs on your host computer, you can pop 'em in and race. - [Anthony] DirectX 3.0a. - Oh, man! Even just this intro screen is so good! The arcade version, no character selection, no bike shop, no unnecessary gossip. Just pick a race and go. Man, remember when you could actually just play a racing game? - Yep. - Okay, could you change the camera angle? I forget. - [Anthony] No, this is it. - [Linus] Are you sure? - [Anthony] This is how the game looks. I'm pretty sure you can't get first-person. - [Linus] Oh, wait, yeah, 'cause this is me. This is me, right? - [Anthony] Yeah. - Control+Alt, maybe... - I think the num pads- - It's either side. - [Anthony] That was the old gamer stance. Wasn't WASD, it was the arrow keys. You had everything clustered around the arrow keys. - I'm gonna kick this cop. You'll never catch me, copper! Oh, oh! Get outta here! Oh, no, no, no! No, no, crap! Oh no! No, no! - Yeah, you don't wanna be on the sidewalk. - [Linus] Sidewalks are a real bad time. - [Anthony] Yeah, there you go. - Oh, oh, oh, not good, not good! - You got road rash! - [Linus] Oh, you have to hike back to your bike. - [Anthony] Yeah, you do. - [Linus] Old games, unforgiving. Oh, no, the cop got me! - [Anthony] Yep. (Linus laughing) - These FMV segments, though! - I love these segments so much. - Now, like, here's the the thing, guys. Playing old games might not impress you much. So what, right? You're running a PC game on a PC. Want a cookie? And I can see why a lot of people would take this sort of thing for granted. Odds are that a lot of old Windows software you try to run will work on newer versions of Windows, but it's not a given. It's thanks to an incredible amount of software engineering that goes into making Windows backwards compatible. One of my favorite stories comes from the nineties, when Microsoft discovered a bug in SimCity that caused it to crash on Windows 95. Their solution was to actually build a mechanism to detect if SimCity was running, and then temporarily alter Windows memory management to work around it. Isn't that incredible? Let's try Mech Warrior 3. - Sure. That's hardware-accelerated, actually. - Oh, whoops, hold on. - Yeah, you need the CD. These are images from my own CD collection, by the way. I don't have them all here, but I own all these games. - Now, I never played this game back in the day. Do you wanna take the wheel? - Sure. I don't remember much about this game, so that's cool. I do know the mouse works and... - [Linus] Holy crap! I didn't have a good computer back then, and I did not know that games looked this good back then. What's impressive about this is that this is 3D accelerated. How do I help people wrap their heads around how cool it is that we are able to play a game on a Voodoo3? - [Anthony] Well, it no longer exists, and Voodoo Hardware only existed for a short period of time anyway, so a lot of games that supported Voodoo hardware also supported OpenGL or Direct3D, so- Oh, he took out my leg immediate- Whoa, dude, with the snipe! - [Linus] You just got wrecked. - [Anthony] Holy crap! Voodoo 3D accelerators were the best back in the day. Nvidia had only just kind of started off the ground and they weren't doing super great with their original NV1. ATI was still kind of trying to find their footing. - But Voodoo only existed for a short period of time. - Yeah, and so the fact that you can run a Voodoo card and it's fully accelerated with all the features, like bilinear filtering, which was a big thing back in the day, otherwise you had the chunky pixels that kind of warped around. - Yeah! - That was huge. And the fact that you can do this is massive. This is being emulated on the CPU, there's no GPU in this system! - Now, I wanna make this clear. Some older games will work without jumping through PCem hoops. You can use community patches, or community projects like DGVoodoo, to convert old APIs like Glide to modern ones, but that can be its own entire rabbit hole unless a studio like Nightdive has taken the time to restore it. I wouldn't expect Nightdive to do anything with this, but it's worth showing you guys just because this is an entire genre of games that I remember very fondly that simply doesn't exist anymore. These interactive learning experiences and multimedia story books were pretty much how a couple of my younger siblings learned to read. There's just no profit in it anymore. Speaking of things that became unprofitable to the point of extinction, encyclopedias. I mean, it sounds like a wild idea now, but what if I didn't want my kids on the internet? There is no reason you couldn't use Encarta 98! - [Anthony] Also, MindMaze is lit. Unlike Wikipedia, which you're definitely not encouraged to use these days at school, we were encouraged and in fact expected to use Encarta, or, like, Compton's or whatever, usually Encarta, to just look stuff up and, you know, do our book reports, or reports on... - [Linus] Tonsillectomy. - [Anthony] Yeah, tonsillectomies. - What should we learn about? Find... Uh, foxes. Smallest member of the dog family, let's go, here's some pictures. It's so cool. Like, to call PCem a success would be selling it well short, but it's worth noting that there are other ways to do pretty much everything I've shown you so far, and I would be remiss if I didn't at least mention them. Probably the least painful way to play older games is in a browser. Many Abandonware MS-DOS games are a five-second Google search away and require no configuration whatsoever to get running. Mixed-Up Mother Goose was another of my childhood favorites and runs perfectly on playclassic.games, which, aside from its obnoxious ads, seems to work pretty well. And those of you who were paying close attention probably noticed that this site, and the others like it, is simply using DOSBox, a free and open-source DOS emulator that you can also set up and run for yourself without any ads. DOSBox runs on just about any modern operating system, and can be used to run pretty much anything that ran on DOS or Windows 3.1, as long as you have the patience to set it up and troubleshoot it. And it's this troubleshooting that leads many retro enthusiasts to simply acquire older hardware, hence Scale. Old software, even if it's running \"correctly,\" is full of idiosyncrasies that made sense at the time, but seem pretty bass-ackwards today. For example, many older games have their physics and animations tied to the CPU clock speed. Therefore, when you would upgrade your computer, they would become completely unplayable. Fun fact, by the way, that was the true purpose of the turbo button on pre-Pentium-era Intel PCs. It was not to make the computer faster, it was actually to slow it down for compatibility with last-gen software. So unfortunately, even older hardware isn't the silver bullet that you might think it would be. I mean, believe it or not, the progressions from DOS, to Windows 3.x, to 95, and Windows 98 took place over many years, and while we might think of them all as kind of part of the DOS-based era, there's no one hardware configuration that will cover you across the board. So after a time, you're gonna end up like Brian the electrician, hoarding dozens of unique configurations and the spare parts to go with them out of fear that your old hardware will eventually fail and that there will be no way to replace it. Now, windows XP'S compatibility mode is gonna get you a lot of the way there, but anyone who ever tried to use it at the time can tell you that it was less of an Apple Rosetta and more of a, \"Oh, wow, it worked! What a pleasant surprise,\" kind of experience. I mean, even PCem can't account for software that's just straight up incompatible with the hardware. Speaking of which... The Need for Speed SE! DirectX is installed. Bleh! - That's a weird hybrid of a Windows and a DOS program. Like, you saw that it said \"install DirectX 2,\" and DirectX 3, too? - I saw that, yes. - Both of those? It actually runs in DOS, and its installer is DOS, and it uses DOS, like, sound configuration. What we're seeing here is whatever incompatibility we have, either be it hardware with our EAX compatible sound card, or maybe our Voodoo graphics card- - Or just Windows 98 at all. - Windows 98 at all, it just will not run. Absolutely not. - However, this apparent weakness is actually one of PCem's greatest strengths. Watch this. Through the magic of simply creating a separate VM that emulates completely different hardware, we can either select our EAX compatible sound card for immersive audio, or we can do this, and handle games that came out during the transition from DOS to Windows 95! Let me tell you, as someone who lived through it, that was a painfully long period, and compatibility was a huge problem. Did you know that they still made DOS games as late as 1998 because of the limitations of the early versions of DirectX? Let's try it again, this time in Windows 95. Hey! There we go! Oh, shoot, I gotta shift and stuff? - [Anthony] Yeah. You should have automatic shift, but you need to shift outta neutral. - Oh, oh, hi there, oops, sorry, hi, Mr. speed limit sign. - [Anthony] This was a very immersive game back in the day. This is unfortunately the \"special edition,\" or SE, which doesn't have any of the fun cutscenes or colorful characters. You just had the racing experience. - [Linus] But while this game from that period works fine, Jane's ATF from 1996 will not run in any version of Windows. It has to be DOS. And good luck getting everything working. Anthony juggled having sound, a mouse, and networking support back in the day due to the need for a massive amount of conventional memory, of which only 640 kilobytes of it is available in DOS. With that in mind, the farther back we go, and we can go all the way back to the original IBM PC, the more DOSBox kind of just makes sense for people who only wanna play games. That is, unless you really want to relive the experience of manual memory management like Anthony and so many others. PCem will give you that experience, and it will be faithful, which I guess leads us pretty well into some of PCem's other weaknesses. For starters, while serial ports and parallel ports are emulated, you cannot pass physical devices to them. Anthony learned this the hard way when he tried to transfer saves from his Dreamcast Massive Memory Card Plus. So what that means is that if, say, an app had a dongle for copy protection, it's to the high seas for you, matey. And if you had designs on replacing old point of sale hardware while keeping the software, tough luck, at least for now. 86Box, a fork of PCem that's looking to improve accuracy, actually has this on their roadmap. But as of right now, you would need to use something like DOSBox-X for passthrough, and then hope that the software is compatible. It's also a lot more difficult to access files on your host PC with PCem and with its derivatives compared to DOSBox. Where DOSBox can just mount any folder you want as a drive letter, PCem is, for better or for worse, much more like the original hardware, requiring either a network connection or a disc. And unfortunately, while the network interface is emulated just fine, and we were actually, you saw, able to transfer files, it couldn't see our host machine on the network, maybe 'cause they have the same MAC address? We're not a hundred percent sure what was going on, And the reality of it is that networking in Windows 98 wasn't great. So what some people end up doing is setting up an FTP server on a separate VM or something. But what we did was to use Folder2Iso, or AnytoISO to quickly turn folders into disc images that then can be mounted inside the VM's virtual CD ROM drive. It's clunky, but at least it's something. Finally, there's the configuration. I did say that PCem was easy to use, but the problem is that there isn't as much granularity as you'd get in DOSBox. Things like setting the IRQs and DMAs for your sound devices might cause problems for you. And unless you're a fan of black borders, or uneven pixels, or Vaseline blur, you're probably gonna need to use the OpenGL 3.0 renderer with the sharp-bilinear-2x-prescale shader from RetroArch if you want to get proper scaling. It also doesn't come with the ROM files that you need to emulate the old hardware because they're probably still legally protected. The good news is that an archive exists on GitHub, because at this point nobody actually cares, but you never know when some company will reach the verge of bankruptcy and decide that it wants to enforce its copyright from 1997 on its BIOS firmware. That would be a dick move. Maybe instead, they should try getting money from someone like our sponsor! Micro Center! Thanks to Micro Center for sponsoring today's video.

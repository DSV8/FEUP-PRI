    "transcript": "- The iPhone 14 kinda sucks. - Whoa, whoa! Is that how you're starting the video? - Every one of our commentators is just gonna be like, \"(chuckles) Of course it is, it's an Apple product.\" (boom) \"Just get something else that's Android.\" - A Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4, perhaps? - Or wait. - Wait, Matt, are we twinning right now? (Matt sighs) Are we twining with Z flips? - Twinning! We've been using the iPhone 14 Pro, specifically, you and me. - [Austin] Yeah. - For you know, about a week now. - Yeah. - And we have thoughts and- - Let's talk about this from the perspective, this is not a review. Youtube.com/mkbhd exists, as does Denki. Both are great videos on the iPhone 14 Pro. But I think for this video- - It's more just like - Lets talk about it. - What our experiences have been. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. So in my opinion, the iPhone 13 Pro was a terrific device. Terrific cameras, great display, 120Hz, excellent battery life. There was really nothing wrong with the 13 Pro. You come to the 14 Pro, and now we've said goodbye to the notch, and hello to the dynamic island. We've got ourselves an always on display, which definitely drains battery. And we've got an upgraded camera system, which it's almost a side grade because like, certain times, yes, it's better, but also certain times I feel like I've been having focus issues. Some of the color and the processing, I feel like is a little bit different because they've completely changed their back end to the Photonic Engine. It's a weird upgrade this year, I think. - Let's start with the elephant in the room: the dynamic island. Or should I call it the dull-lamic island? - What? You cannot say the dull-namic island. - Dull-namic island. - Hit me, why don't you like the dull-namic island? - So, I wanna be very clear that when they showed off the island in the, you know the keynote, whatever we're calling it these days. - The event. - The event, the event. I do fully believe that the way that they've integrated, is the best way to integrate like, a notch, a hole punch, anything. A couple other Chinese brands have already immediately started copying it. It looks really good on, no matter, kind of, where it is. But the implication has been really weird to me. Because, okay, sure. Like, music works great on it, but you know what's dumb? - What's that? - Notifications don't use it. Like, notifications still bounce down below the island. There's a wasted line of pixels when you get a notification. So now, where the notch was, it's a good like, quarter of the screen, which is then taken up by, between the notification, the dynamic island, and then this like, the kind of No Man's Land that's above the island. Why would notifications not expand out from that like every other thing else? - I think it might just be because the dynamic island, like, the parts that they can't work around, which is the hole punch and the little pill. - That's square in the middle. So, if you wanted to put like, notification text up there, you would have to like put it off to the side or something. My thought is that the dynamic island this is very much the version 1.0. - Yeah. Look, like, they've got like a very solid, like, core. My bet, is that next year when we see iOS 17, the dynamic island will turn into a dynamic... tropical paradise. - So like, alright, we've talked about this a lot. And I'll just kind of, give you my thoughts again on. I know full well, why Apple is going with the pill, versus like, a hole punch, whatever. Because when you have like, a silhouette of a phone, like an icon. You couldn't immediately look and say, that's an iPhone. If you have like the, the hole punch, it's like, oh, is that a Samsung? Is that a Xiaomi? Is that a whatever? - Is that a Z Flip Four in your pocket? - You can't, like, the silhouette you can't tell. And that's purely a branding thing. It has nothing to do, like, that is fully form over function. And that's kind of what Apple's all about. That's like, why they introduced, I think, the notch to like, the MacBook pros. Like, I guarantee we're gonna see the island in MacBook in the, in the next refresh. - I would not be wildly surprised. - Like, it's, that's, they wanna keep things succinct. Whatever. - Yeah. - Cool, great. - [Both] Whatever. - However, the notch like, was because it was so static, you just forgot that it was there within seconds of using it. But you are very aware that the dynamic island is there. You know, we shoot in 16 by 9. People ask constantly, can we please go into like, 18 by 9 aspect ratios? We used to do that. But then it was like really annoying, production wise. So we went back to 16 by 9. - Yeah. - And like, all the content I consume is 16 by 9. You know, when you have a phone that is not a 16 by 9 phone, it's gonna get letterboxed, anyway. That's why I never really cared whether it was a hole punch, where, nothing, because all that's cut off. If someone who's watching, almost exclusively YouTube content, and they have people who are uploading in 2 to 1, I see that being a big problem. And. - That's a very niche kind of case, though. Isn't it? - Based on what I'm seeing from people talking about online, it's more prevalent than I think, you and I think. - I think the way that Apple have done the dynamic island, is generally a step forward, right? Because before, that notch was just dead space. And now there are things you can do. I like the ability to, you know, have my music up there. There's neat things that they're doing there. I agree, it's not fully fleshed out. But it comes back to sort of, my initial point of, the like, the 13 Pro was essentially the perfect device, right? They had taken all their ideas, the notch, face ID, all the stuff, they'd taken it to its logical conclusion. Now they're kind of throwing some of that out with the 14, and they're starting the next wave, where I bet, two, three years from now, we'll say, oh, this is the version of the dynamic island that is sort of ideal and perfected. But we haven't seen that. - I miss my 13. In fact- - Whoa, do you really? - In fact, I missed my 12 mini, for the record. - Yeah, I miss the Mini. - For the record. Walk me through. So you find yourself a week into the iPhone 14, missing the 13. - Yeah. - Why, what's wrong with it? - So, it's not like night and day difference. - [Austin] Sure. - The battery life has been noticeably worse. Even with turning off always on display. - Oh, really? Interesting, okay. - Like, I'm not the only one who's noticed this. Like, most people said, \"I'm turning this off because the battery life is so much worse.\" Battery's never been a problem for me, even when I had the the mini. And I wanna be clear that battery's not a problem for me. - But you notice it's a downgrade. - But I notice a difference. When I would go and lay down in bed, usually around 11 o'clock at night. - That's a good time, good job. - I go to bed early, I'm an old man. - [Austin] Same. - My routine hasn't changed, but I come home and I maybe have like 30, 40% left on the day. But now when I'm going to lay down, I'm having maybe like, 20%. My battery is actually saying like, \"hey, you're gonna die soon.\" (bell chimes) - (laughing) Whoa, wait, rephrase that one. - Yeah, I didn't phrase that great. Let me put, with the 13, I stopped scrolling TikTok when I wanted to. Now, with the 14, I'm scrolling TikTok, I have to end when my phone tells me to end. Because the battery is dying. - So, what you're saying is the iPhone 14 is an improvement and it's helping you live a healthier life. - Again, it's not a massive night and day difference. - [Austin] Okay, okay. - But like, it is, I do think it's a downgrade. And if the solution is, turn off always on display, Well, that's a selling point to the phone. - I will say, the always-on display, for me, is still really disconcerting 'cause it's like, I keep thinking my phone screen is on. - It is weird to me. - I think it's one of those things where I get the idea that this is something that if I spend enough time, I will get used to, but I'm still in that phase, like, oh my phone's not locked. Oh they're like, I'm like constantly, like hitting the power button. Cause I'm not sure. - [Matt] Yeah. Is that always on or not? And the thing is, if you don't like it, you can turn it off and it will give you some battery like saving. - That is the actual, like, that is one of the new selling points to a 14 versus like I say, a 13. - [Austin] Yeah. - So like to say like, oh, just turn off this feature. That seems like short changing. Coming back to the battery life. I wonder how much the satellite, it's not like you're constantly connected to a satellite. - [Austin] Exactly, right? - [Matt] Like it's, I wonder if there's like an, you know, every once in a while it's pinging an expert, like a little bit. - All I can say is, in my limited testing of the iPhone 14, which again it's about a week or so as of filming this video. I have personally not noticed a real difference, but also I have not done like a full travel day. Like for me, the number one battery test is always you know, a full travel day, waking up early in the morning, going to the airport, flying. - Yeah. - Going to a hotel. Like that's always the point where I can tell like how solid a battery is, because honestly since the 13, the battery on iPhones have been so good that it takes a travel day like that for it to die. - Yeah. - The only real issue I have with the iPhone 14 Pro personally for me. - Yeah. - Is the camera. Now I know that as of recording studio, again, this might might change by the time you're actually watching it. There is a bug where like the camera, like, how would you describe it? - It clicks. - Like jitters? It clicks. - It clicks, clicks. Like I, I had this happening. In third party apps, with like Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, people reporting that the camera, like the stabilization in the camera was actually like freaking out. - [Austin] That is being fixed. Apple's announced they're working on the patch. - Yes they've confirmed. - Very shortly. - And that like the only one that won't be fixed, in, in this patch coming up is battery. Which I still think could be fixed in a, a, a software thing for optimization. - It's hard to know what the real the battery issue is. But for me, the main difference between the 13 and the 14, is in the ultra wide and in the standard main sensor. Right? So it's a larger main sensor. You've got a different ultra wide, and also they've redone the processing, right. So I'll start with the processing cause that's sort of the most straightforward one. - Yep. - Because they've switched to the photonic engine, which is a completely different way that they're kind of processing images, and doing processing earlier in the pipeline. So they're working on the raw images, versus when some stuff has been baked in, which they kind of explained to me and it made, it makes sense. I've noticed that some images, definitely on white balance, but especially when it comes to like sharpness, and whatnot, seem like they're a little too aggressive. Part of that might be be because they've got more mega pixels, that's just sort of naturally sharper. But to me, it's almost like, sometimes images seem a touch over processed, but my bigger issue has been with focus. So here, the way that the focus on any camera works is pretty straightforward. The bigger the sensor you've got, the shallow or the depth of field, right? So, I mean, if we look at my angle right here you can see I'm in focus. Now I'm not, because the actual plane of focus is very shallow. We shoot on Sony FX3's, which are big, full sensor, full frame sensor cameras. Which means that you get that nice shallow depth of field. But the downside is the focus is very thin. Because the sensors larger on the iPhone, it is by definition, just gonna be harder to focus, right? Because a smaller shallower area is going to stay sharp when you were, you know, tapping or trying to, to take a photo. But to be fair, I've noticed the same problem with a lot of modern Android phones that have very large sensors. - [Matt] Yeah. - And just that if you miss focus, for example, if Matt shirts in focus, but his face isn't, and you can still get a decent photo, but you'll see his face is just a little bit blur. - Are you saying it's a decent photo because my face is blurred? - I am actually saying that. - Wow. - But that's the thing. The, I don't know how much that this can really be solved. Like I just think that, with the iPhone 14 Pro, for me personally, I am no longer just gonna point and shoot quite so much. I'm actually gonna maybe take a second, and tap on a face, or tap on a subject, because I can't quite trust that it's actually gonna be focused. - I don't like that mentality for a, a phone camera. - But on the flip side though, and I will give 'em credit. The larger sensor does mean that some things like that shallow depth of field, the ones that look nice. - No, I, I've seen, where I've seen it be better is like, okay. I've seen a lot of like side by side tests with like a Samsung or whatever. - [Austin] Yeah. - [Matt] It's like, here's the 10x on the Samsung, here's. - [Austin] Oh, with the zoom. - [Matt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. For the most part I've liked iPhone better, in those comparisons. Some of that extra sharpening seems to, to do well in, for like, for the iPhone. Like you seeing like pores in people's faces. - [Austin] Yeah. - [Matt] You get in more detailed that way. - It's stylistic choice. - Right. And that's, that's pure preference. Like it's, I don't, it's not like, I'm like, oh, that like the, the Samsung looks like crap. It's I like 10, like, oh, I like the way this sharpened a little bit more, whatever. I wanna talk about lightning and USB C. - Can we just say that lightning sucks, and USB C is better? That's all I need to say. - Me personally, I'm like, I don't really care about lightning, but last year it was like really, really noticeable. When we started seeing ProRes on the cameras. - It's unusable. And it's unusable to try to transfer gigabytes of footage over a lightning connector. It will take forever. - And now this year, like, have you seen the file sizes for the 48 megapixel route? - 70 megabytes, per photo. - So even like, even if you're not doing ProRes, if you're just doing basic photos, which a lot of people will, that's a really big problem. This is the year, I feel like they, they, like if they were gonna go with USB C at all, they should have. - It's gonna be next year, man. I, the ultra, the iPhone Ultra, mark my words, editor's note, Aaron, you can clip this and you can reuse it in 11 months when the iPhone Ultra comes out. (mild TV static) Next year, iPhone 15, we'll have an Ultra model that will have USB C. - So I have a much more wild take. - No port? - Yeah. With all the European regulation of, oh, we have to be USB C or we have to do like - [Austin] Standardized. - Yeah, standardized. And I really hope I'm wrong for on this for the record. Cause I don't, I don't think this is good for anyone. But I, I feel like we're gonna see a port-less iPhone before we see a USB C one. - Port-less is possible, but the problem is like, okay. So again, take me for example. The only time I really use the port on my phone, typically speaking. - [Both] Is for CarPlay. - Which good luck trying to. - Yeah. - Oh am I gonna have to use a dongle for that? - Yep. - Like maybe I will, that's gonna suck. - But like, all right. - Charging every once in a while. - And this is not me defending Apple, for the record. If I'm thinking of like, oh, I'm, I'm a company trying to make all the money in the world, I'm gonna make my port-less iPhone. And then I'm gonna make a MagSafe, a MagSafe. - To USB dongle. - To lightning dongle. So now with all the 10 billion iPhones I sell that year. - Everyone's gonna spend that, party bus. - Everyone's got everyone, gotta spend that to, to use their existing accessories. Look, it's (groan). - Yeah. - But I feel like I. - I could see it, man. - [Both] I could see it. - And I do believe that that MaxSafe does have some rudimentary data. - [Matt] It does. - A- ability. - Yeah. - It's a little like nebulous because they haven't really opened it up. But from some conversations I've had with some accessory companies, there is some level of data you could unlock via that. - So let's talk about the eSIM. - Yeah. - Personally, and I know, again, this is not the most popular opinion on eSIM. I think this is a great move. - Woo, gang. - And yes, it's inconvenient for some people. - For almost everyone. - I, I don't think it is. Going from iPhone to iPhone, is is super easy. Do I think it sucks right now? Yes. Do I think the move is good long term? Also yes. Good or bad, Apple is a trend setter for the industry. What they do. - Yeah. - Everyone else follows. What's gonna happen is, Samsung's gonna make a couple attack ads, where they're like, \"Oh, our phones come with SIM trays.\" And then next year the, the, their phones are not gonna have SIM trays. If all the, all the phone manufacturers stop making trays, that means carriers are gonna have to get on board with it. One misconception is that if you have an eSIM, that there's no SIM at all, there actually is. There's just, it's just integrated into the phone. But when you don't have the SIM tray, you open up a lot of possibilities for how you can act, like for how manufacturers can actually stuff components into there. Because- - Unlike what they've done now is that they've removed the SIM on the U.S. iPhone. And it's just a blank space. - Right. Right now, right. But now think about it next year when all of them don't have it, that could be an extra 10% battery life. Like, that's why I don't like the argument that a lot of people had of just like, \"Oh, well this phone, it's thick enough to have a headphone jack.\" It's not just the thickness of the jack, headphone jacks are pretty long. - Yeah. - And that's a lot of, that's a lot of internal space wasted on the headphone jack. - Sure. - So like while yeah, it sucks, a lot of people like using headphones. Look at battery sizes over the last year since headphone jacks have gone away. They've gotten a lot bigger. - [Austin] Yeah. - And that's a big reason for it. - My main concern with the eSIM thing is that you're putting more power in the hands of carriers, who maybe don't have your best interest at heart all the time. You know, especially when it comes to switching in and out. And obviously it's not like it's impossible to switch eSIM, from one to another. But like these systems are Byzantine. They're ancient. They're difficult. And while yes, eSIM works kind of okay. It is really only in the U.S.. And I think there's a reason why only the U.S. iPhones dropped the SIM chart- tray. I think it is gonna be a very long time before carriers all around the world are fully on board with this. - You have to get the ball rolling at some point, and- - Yeah yeah, yeah. And that's clearly what Apple are doing. - Right, right. - They're trying to force it through. I, I understand. - And like, I, like, I think it will get better. It, I agree that it sucks right now. How many people have said like, oh man, I'm so mad that they got rid of the eSIM? Now I can't put like an international SIM in there. - Yeah. - And then they've never left their hometown. Again, this only effects U.S. phones. I wanna keep that in mind. - For now. - Like, you know, like, yes, there's a lot of people, who need to have international SIMs, but they can just get an international iPhone. You can go and get the Canadian iPhone, which. - There's not enough freedom in that one. (eagle cawing) Are you on board with my theory that the iPhone 14 is really an iPhone 15, like, like. - Every phone, is- - It feels especially strong this year that like, they tested half the stuff to go put in the iPhone 15. - Yeah. - Dropping the SIM card by really, really focusing on the dynamic island. - I, I do. - By getting the bigger cameras and whatnot. - I do agree with you. And that's why I think we need to, to go back to, this is a 13S. I liked that naming structure better. - Aren't you ready though? For the iPhone next year to have a camera bump that looks like a Pixel. I'm telling you it's gonna happen. Where else I gonna put that, that Periscope camera . - This gonna be the whole big thing. - It's gonna be a whole big thing, but you know what? Let us know what you think in the comments below. And if you have made it to this point in the video, make sure to subscribe to the channel, because, when we hit 400,000 subscribers. The This Is crew is throwing a pizza party. You won't be invited, but I, just know that the This Is crew's very excited for the pizza party. Right, Kenzie? - Yes. - See, don't you wanna make Kenzie happy? Subscribe to the channel.",

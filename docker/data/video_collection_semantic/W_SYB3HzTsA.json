    "transcript": "what is up everyone the studio is uh well clean ready to be made dirty very soon I want to start off the video though by talking about this work met here this is something you can use you can actually ground yourself if you want to be super proper with PC building and the like but I took those off it issues this kind of like as a building mat to protect the finish on the wood underneath even though this desk really isn't that expensive but I have this mat link in the description along with a few other alternatives this one is from alpha cool and it's pretty pricey so I recommend getting something maybe a bit cheaper than this that will do the same thing this one was designed to do it's also easy to cut down to size so it kind of fits the shape of the desk now as for today's video we've got to take a tour to the closet here this is not only my personal closet for clothes and whatnot but also all of the tech gear that I've kind of just stashed back here along with two PC builds that I haven't yet torn down so in this video we're going to tear down the horizon 7 custom loop PC build in this case right here this is the fractal to find C sorry about the weird autofocus and the dark it doesn't do very well the too soon yeah too soon so in every custom loop you've got three primary components you've got your radiators you've got your water blocks for your graphics cards and/or CPU and then you've got your reservoir somewhere else in the case I recommend having a reservoir pretty hard to fill your loop if you didn't have one the trick to draining a custom loop is to start with your lowest common denominator and that's figuratively speaking so I want to drain from one of these two ports because this is pretty much the lowest point in the loop with the exception of the pump which is down here this is gonna really difficult to get out we're gonna do some tilting and whatnot to get the rest of the fluid out but if we turn one of these dials here the fluid from this run is going to fall out that's expected but what we're going to have an issue with is trying to get air to be forced from the top of the loop down through the loop to get the fluid out the bottom right because if we have everything sealed up top and the only fluid that's going to leave the fluid right here there's gonna be a lot of pressure built up in the reservoir and also in the block so to prevent a lot of this fluid higher in the loop from falling down we're gonna take out anything that's not critical to the loop we're going to take out all of the cables that we can easily access including the eight pin VGA cables and we're also going to take out the 24 pin anything related to the power supply we went out first because if we do happen to spawn a leak somewhere we don't want our power supply getting soaked by any means you know the last time I clean this was the last time I turn this PC on and dust still manages to find its way in here this is kind of the issue with semi much of the power supplies the cables that you need will have to be plugged into the power supply but any extra cables just kind of have to be hanging around and that's kind of what I found myself running into here also the pump is down below so any excess cabling couldn't go down there so it just kind of had to I don't know lay it like this alright power supply is removed now we're going to rotate it and start draining the fluid now for those wondering what the coolant composition is I'm using some DI water and some true opaque white this is just concentrated premix here I added that to it I think it's one of these for every gallon of fluid don't quote me on that but very simple procedure just dump it all in mix it and you'll be fine now for the drain because remember said we're gonna unplug one of these two here probably this one just because it runs to the CPU block we're gonna uncap this we're going to use a funnel one of these three funnels pick and choose your poison and then we gonna have it drained from the funnel itself through one of these rubber tubes to the bottle does I want to recycle this stuff there's nothing wrong with the fluid in there right now so we're gonna reuse it in a future build now if you got really fancy with your custom loop or you know you just did it the right way and included a drain valve somewhere then you could just simply screw this on to the other side of the drain valve and then open it up and then this could funnel into whatever you wanted the fluid funnel into but for now we're just gonna try it the old-fashioned way we're gonna shove a funnel right under here and just kind of raw doggin let's see how much of it we can catch in the bottle also in the event of any leaks make sure to have some kind of splash proof so and ready to go yes this is Thomas the Train do not judge me and just as another precaution I'm gonna take a towel line and lay inside here so don't have any fluid finding its way into the crevices of the case and we're gonna go ahead and start draining now cap is Oh I'm actually working out pretty well fluid is pretty much out of the graphics card blocks for now that's a good thing we're gonna go ahead and isolate the rest of the loop here by taking these out so these two pipes are going to be kind of just hanging what I'm going to do is take out this run to the CPU and just cap it off with one of these G quarter caps and then the only available ICA's exit port for fluid is going to be this pipe here I'm going to turn the PC I guess this side down and this will be where hopefully the remainder of the fluid drains check it out these fittings here from premature literally warped the PE TG tubing talk about a water tight fit there's one 1080 and there is 210 eighties isn't it weird how empty the case looks without two graphics cards so you can see we pretty much got the radiator isolated the fluid up here at the top is just kind of sitting so I expect the fluid level to be somewhere around here actually this is where the fluids equalized at this point so the fluid and the radiators probably around here somewhere and we can see that up in the back there's no fluid so we're going to go ahead and detach the radiator completely and try our best to pull that out although it is kind of wedged against the pump and kinda moved around a little bit and then the last two pieces to remove the reservoir and the pump all right and the last two things to come out the reservoir and the CPU block I can disconnect this without fluid flying everywhere all right and after about an hour or so of cleaning all these parts I haven't actually torn down the graphics card block suppose some goo still in there but tore down the CPU blog flushed the radiator flushed the reservoir and make sure the pump was nice and clean this is kind of the end result here so I'm just gonna package the stuff back up once it dries and I will reuse it in a future build so for those wondering what happens to the custom loops when you don't see them anymore video most of the time this is what happens I tear them down and I just recycle the parts and now we have an empty case ready for the next build so if you've enjoyed this kind of like behind-the-scenes look at what I do when I tear down PC sure let me know by giving this video a thumbs up I appreciate that thanks for stopping by on this weekend of yours if you're watching this when it was uploaded if you want to leave a comment suggestion for a future topic sure to do that in the comment section below and check out links to support us on social media and elsewhere this is science studio thanks for learning with us you",

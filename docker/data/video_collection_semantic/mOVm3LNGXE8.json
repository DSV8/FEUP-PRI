    "transcript": "- Today we're checking out two new phones from One Plus, the OnePlus 8 Pro and the OnePlus 8. We should probably unbox these first. Yeah I know, they're unboxed already, don't ask questions. (hip hop music) The 8 Pro has a 6.78 inch, 120 hertz, QHD fluid display. Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor, it's 5G compatible, and you can get up to 12 gigs of RAM, plus 256 gigs of storage. It has a 4,510 milliamp battery, Wi-Fi 6 enabled, a quad camera, and it comes in three colors: Onyx Black, Ultramarine Blue, and Interstellar Glow. The 8 has a 6.55-inch, 90 hertz fluid display, also running Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 with 5G, and also can be configured up to 12 gigs of RAM with 256 gigs of storage, with a triple camera setup. (hip hop music) This color is so incredibly beautiful, it actually took my breath away. I wasn't recording my reaction when I opened this, but if I was, it would've been something like this. (gasps) And I love that it's kind of a matte finish, so the fingerprints are way less visible than on the OnePlus 8, but this color, if I didn't see this blue first, this interstellar glow (gasps) has my name on it. It's got a really nice rainbow reflection, we'll get more into the phones in a second, but I've got some cases and one of the new Warp Charge 30 wireless chargers. This is pretty great because OnePlus Pro has a 4,510 milliamp battery so you can charge 1% to 50% in just half hour with this new wireless charger. While the regular OnePlus doesn't have wireless charging, you can charge the 4,300 milliamp battery using the Warp Charge 30T charger. In 22 minutes, you can go from 1% to 50%. Let's check out some of these new cases. (hip hop music) (boxes ripping) Oh yeah. There we go, that looks nice. This new quad camera is something that I think everyone is gonna be really excited about. The eight megapixel 3X Telephoto will give you up to 30X digital zoom, plus enhanced optical image stabilization. The ultra wide is 48 megapixels, it'll give you 120 degree field of view. It also features super macro mode, which you can capture images up to three centimeters away. The main camera also is a 48 megapixel camera and the color filter camera is five megapixels. So now that we're outside in my confined backyard, still got my house slippers on because that's what we do here (laughs) now. I'm gonna test out the camera on the OnePlus 8 Pro, here it is, and I've got my beautiful model here. Matty. You've looked better. Pose for mommy, iMommy. (camera shutter clicking) Are you handsome? Have you looked better? It's okay, we all have. Obviously, one of the things that I'd love to test out is video, so, (phone beeps) let's test this out. We're actually shooting this in HDR right now. Do you wanna tell us about your quarantine? How's it going? Let's focus on your little face. There we go. Quarantine pup. So now I wanna see what it looks like if I'm filming myself to see how the wide angle looks. If I'm filming myself vlogging, one day, when we can go outside again. I can't wait to vlog. I've actually, this has all kinda made me miss vlogging a little bit, just cause I can't do it. It's classic. Matty, just cause we can't do something, that makes us wanna do it even more. Yup, we're human. So are you. Matty, is that Yoshi? Is that Yoshi? Let's get Yoshi and test out slow-mo. Matty, sit. Okay, you're a dog that doesn't listen. (laughs) So Matty's not performing. So, let me just think about this. I'll take a selfie in the mean time. This is portrait mode selfie. (camera shutter clicking) Okay, let's just take a regular one. Let me take a picture of my shoes. A-K-A slippers! So this is 1X, wide angle, and 3X zoom. (camera shutter clicking) I mean, hello. Have you seen anything more fashionable? (phone beeping) No, you haven't. Matty, let's test out these color filters, okay? So, here we are. This is regular, (camera shutter clicking) this is matte. (camera shutter clicking) Look beautiful. Vivid. (camera shutter clicking) Black and white. (camera shutter clicking) And this is photo chrome. (camera shutter clicking) Matty, you blinked. We're gonna test out macro mode. So this you can get super close. You can see the fibers, each tiny little thread. I'm gonna do it on Matty. Let me get down to your nose. (camera shutter clicking) (gasps) Are you all right, buddy? Are you having a time? Look at his nose! You can see everything! Gosh, I do not wanna do that to my face. The display on the OnePlus 8 Pro is really incredible. That 120 hertz refresh rate is really impressive. The display also has the highest color accuracy ever on a OnePlus phone. It supports to true-to-life colors with HDR 10 plus. It's eight millimeters thin, you can configure it in two different models, an eight gig or 12 gig. Much like most phones that aren't iPhones, it does have an in-display fingerprint sensor. Using LPDDR4X RAM, this allows the phone to ramp up the memory speeds by 30% while lowering power consumption by 20%. It has dual speakers, powered by Dolby Atmos with a new haptic vibration engine. This will allow your content and games to feel more true-to-life. With Warp Charge, you can go from 1% to 50% battery in a half hour with their new wireless Warp Charge 30. It also has reverse wireless charging, so in 23 minutes, that can give you up to a 50% battery life. Using this phone outdoors is really great because the maximum brightness of the display is 1,300 nits, and it also has an adaptive color temperature with up to 4,096 brightness levels. Jenna is now going to do a run-through of all these different modes that we have to do some videos, we have the 4K 30, 4K 60, the 4K Cine 30, and 4K Cine 60 frames a second, and of course we have Matty, who you've seen, who's not really performing very well today. I think he just wants to sleep all day. Same. All right, Jen. Photos, videos, let's start with video, and then we'll roll into the photo. - This is my favorite color! - I know. - No way! - I know. - Oh, I'm jea-- Oh, wow! - It's pretty nice. - Oh my goodness! It's beautiful. - I know. Okay, 4K 30, this is me, hello, regular, let's see wide angle. Can you see these shoes? - [Jenna] No. Well, now I can. - What's Matty doing? - [Jenna] He's digging. - Zoom in on him. - [Jenna] Times three. Oh. - [Justine] What are you doing? All right, let's do 4K 60 and get you some slow-mo hair flow. (lively music) Pantene Pro-V, call me! The cinematic mode gives us a 21:9 aspect ratio, so we'll get some really great cinematic shots, because it's what we need. It's what we need, Jen. So, here it is. You can tell that the aspect ratio is definitely different than the previous, so let me perform for you. (performing vocal warm ups) Oh no, I almost fell over! 4K 60, let's try it. Since this is 4K 60 Cinematic, let's do a cinematic fashion show, shall we? I'll do a walk. (lively music) (laughs) - You threw me off. - I threw me off a little! Now we're gonna take some photos, I just changed this to the 48 megapixels, so we'll be able to get higher quality. All right, Jenny, ready? - Yeah. - So in the 48 megapixel, it won't give you a 3X zoom, so you're gonna have to switch back to it. We'll do an Ultrawide 48, and a regular. - [Jenna] Okay. - All right, now let's pop that into the 12 megapixel and take all three photos. Can you see my shoes? - [Jenna] Yes. One, two. - I'm falling. (both laugh) - Well, we got it. - Guys, we haven't really left the house in how many days? - You start to fall so you can see the blur of, like, your-- - Let's do some portraits. Oh, new profile pic, who this? Is this real dramatic? - [Jenna] You look like you just escaped-- - [Justine] No, this is beautiful. That is art. That's a photo to be proud of. (laughs) - It actually looks pretty cool. - They also have a new feature, there's a fourth camera on here and it's a color filter. This is actually not just a filter, this is a filter that's built into the camera. So I'm gonna do tree pose by the tree. (lively music) Well thank you, Jenna, for demoing our little photos here, and video, I appreciate it. (baby talking to dog) Well guys, thank you so much for watching, this was just a first look at the OnePlus 8 and the OnePlus 8 Pro. I definitely look forward to testing this out a little bit more, especially when we're able to leave the house. I can take this out and get some cool videos and some cool photos for you guys, but for now, this is my little quarantine review of the OnePlus 8 Pro. Let me know if there's anything else that you would like for me to test out with this thing, I love the color, (bird chirping) I love the video, I love the sound of this bird chirping quite loudly in the background. Thank you, I hear you! Friend, God, outside is so nice. I miss it out here. (hums) (lively music) Come on, let's go! If you see somebody, you shoot them! - [Game] Reloading! - Do you know how to play the game, boys? (laughs) (guns firing) If you see someone, you shoot them! UAV, mommy's coming in hot! (laughs) (guns firing) Headshot, boom, headshot, boom, low ammo, let's take it. This other team, man, they are trash, trash! Oh my God, they're all behind me. Ha, I didn't even see it, the whole team was behind me cause I was too busy trash talking. If I'm not on kill cam, I'm gonna be very upset. - [Game] Reloading, cover me. - There I am. (guns firing) No more, no more, no more. Let's finish this video. (laughs)",

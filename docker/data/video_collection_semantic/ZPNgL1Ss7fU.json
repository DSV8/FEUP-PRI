    "description": "My Samsung S9 Plus review is still to come but I'm switching over to it as my daily driver.  Phone and Laptop Skins -   The variable aperture lens is cool. But when you compare photos from the S9, keep aperture number in mind. (Don't compare low light F2.4 photos with low light F1.5 photos)  Other phones like the iPhone X and the Pixel 2 XL have very wide apertures as well!

    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going? Dave 2D here. So, the Galaxy S9 Plus I've been using it for about two days at this point. I'm going into day three and Here's the thing Samsung phones are usually not my favorite phone usually I find some kind of thing that I dislike about it Whether it's like some kind of hardware thing or like a speaker thing I usually don't love Samsung phones enough to switch over to them But this time around really like this phone hence this really short video where I kind of explain Why so this is the Pixel 2 XL Switching over from this to this and The big thing for me is actually not the camera or any kind of like the more heavily Advertised features its the speakers this is if I'm not mistaken the first Samsung flagship that has had stereo speakers And it makes a really big difference for me when it comes to just the general use of this phone I often play music or watch videos on my phone And it's just a really big difference to have stereo speakers the camera like this is the thing that's kind of weird they Advertise this thing really heavily They marketed this thing is like you know the world's first variable aperture camera, and it's cool like the camera is great But seriously I took a bunch of photos, and I don't really see a huge benefit of the variable aperture thing yet No, it's not with the photos that I take now the low-light performance is better on that samsung S9 It's noticeably better than the S8 and I think it's actually better than even the pixel 2xl for low-light photos It's going to use the F1.5 to let the most light in the low-light images are very clean on the S 9 slightly cleaner than the pixel 2XL But the difference feels pretty minor when you compare to the iphone 10 though the difference is more substantial The slo-mo stuff is kind of neat But it's not easy to time properly the slow motion recording is activated by motion not through user input So it's not as easy as you might think the AR emoji stuff is just straight-up junk to me, but hey That's just me now. It's a great camera, but the camera isn't what's making me switch to the S 9 It really is the speakers for Samsung to finally put stereo speakers on their flagship device just completes this phone for me I also love the design. I forget how good the Samsung phones feel? I think that's something that we all kind of take for granted the design of this phone like we've seen it so often the S8 and the S8 plus we're so common because there are such good phones if you look at this thing objectively And just kind of step back and think about what this phone is it is a beautiful phone and this year I feel like the curvature on the glass is just a little bit less pronounced like it's just a little bit easier to Hold it feels more comfortable in my hand than the s8 and the S8 plus did. I also miss the wireless charging It's like a bonus feature that comes with any of the Samsung flagships and the pixel 2 XL didn't have it The glass back on the s9 has the usual grimy fingerprint issues, but I put a skin on it It's an easy fix, and it makes it look good the processor like the new Snapdragon 845 It's fast, but it's again Not the thing that makes me switch to it and also the screen when you switch over to this thing from anything That's like not a Samsung display. You kind of forget How good these ones are. It's a really good screen It supposed to be brighter in today's like I've compared them side by side between the S8 and the S9 it is brighter But I wouldn't base your decision on that because it's not that much brighter than the S8 or the S8 plus screen now I will say this if you've disliked Samsung phones in the past for whatever reason like if you don't like Bixby or if you don't Like the Samsung experience UI and those things are deal-breakers for you, then you probably won't like this phone again Because it's not like a major revamp It's still a Samsung phone through and through it's just that it feel like Lee perfected the Samsung experience It's like It really is in my opinion the best Samsung phone that you could possibly make with our current technology Like what would you do to this thing to make it any better? It really is a kick-ass phone OK Hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it. See you guys next time",

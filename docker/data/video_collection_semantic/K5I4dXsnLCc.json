    "description": "Induction Speakers (USA Link) -  Induction Speakers (International) -   This video features an odd gadget. This little hollow feeling speaker uses induction technology to amplify the speaker of any device you place on top of it. It's actually quite surprising to hear the increase in volume in the absence of a bluetooth or wifi connection to the speaker directly. Is the quality as good as a high-end bluetooth speaker? Not quite, but this thing could still be quite useful given the right application.  FOLLOW ME IN THESE PLACES FOR UPDATES Twitter -  Facebook -  Instagram -  Google Plus -",

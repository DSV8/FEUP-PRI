See how these networks actually worked with this fully working demonstration of 10base5, 10base2 and 10baseT. I am accessing the Internet from Windows 3.11 and Windows 98 computers connected via transceivers to a 10base5 network. These cables are also known as thicknet and thinnet. Bob Metcalfe invented Ethernet in the 1970s and it has changed the world.  This is the birth of ethernet - 10base5. Then came 10base2 and then 10base t. You should know a bit of the history of networking if you are studying for your CompTIA network+ or Cisco CCNA certifications. You may even be a CCNP and have not seen these ethernet networks in your lifetime. Learn about transceivers, vampire taps and the other old technologies used in past Ethernet networks.   This is a classic example of retro computing using a true retro network from years ago. This is before the days of lan parties when retro gaming was big using retro games such as doom.   See how the original Ethernet actually worked with Terminators, Vampire Taps, Network Interface Cards (NICs) drop cables, Attachment Unit Interfaces (AUI), Medium Attachment Units (MAU), transceivers, BNC connectors, Thicknet 10base5 cabling, 10base2 cabling and more!   Robert Bob Metcalfe developed Ethernet in the 1970s. This is a working version of that 10base5 network.

    "transcript": "- I've started a new series retro networking. I wanna teach you about the history of networking and show you practically what happened in the past. I've seen a lot of people talk about 10Base five as an example using PowerPoint presentations, but I haven't seen anyone bold a 10Base five network and practically demonstrated. That's what I'm gonna do in this video. (upbeat music) I've created a network using a Windows 3.11 laptop and to Windows 98 PCs. I'm gonna show you practically how 10Base five works. We're gonna look at the cabling. Here's an example of a 10Base five cable. This stuff is very difficult to work with 10Base five. Notice these black markings on the cable. This is where you had to insert a transceiver. A transceiver such as this. This transceiver has what's called a vampire tap or network tap. So, you would take a transceiver like this, this would be connected to this portion of the transceiver. Here's the vampire tap, that you'd need to use. You'd have these screws that you had to unscrew, crazy tech old technology. Can you imagine us having to do this today. You had to cut a hole in this cable on this black portion, and then you would insert the transceiver and that would give you a connection to the network. Really old technology. Now if you've ever wondered why this is called thicknet, notice how thick this cable is very, very difficult to work with. Here's an example of thinnet, much easier to work with much smaller cable. So here I have an Ethernet cable 50 ohm thin Ethernet coax we told it's got BNC male, male Ethernet connectors, it's 15.2 meters. We can see at the back here, how we should connect our devices. So, we shown as an example that we need T connectors, we need terminators on the end, but notice how thin this cable is compared to thicknet. So this is 10Base two, also called thinnet. Notice how thick this cable is in comparison. I think it's quite obvious why this was called thicknet and this was called thinnet. I mean you can just see the difference in the size of the cable. Today we would do something like this. Here's Cat five cabling. Here's Cat six cabling. Much easier to work with UTP cabling or Unshielded Twisted Pair cabling today, than it is to work with 10Base two or 10Base five. Notice the size of this terminator. This is a terminator in 10Base five here's a terminator in 10Base two. 10Base two transceivers are also quite large, similar to 10Base five. So 10Base two here 10Base five over there, but then they got a lot smaller. So here's an example of a more modern 10Base two transceiver compared to a 10Base five transceiver. And then we have UTP or RJ45 Transceivers. So here's a Cisco transceiver that you would insert on an AUY connector on a router as an example. Modern transceivers look like this, so this is an example of a fiber transceiver that would go into a switch. Also known as an SFP. But notice how the technology has changed over time, we've moved from something like this very, very big to something a lot smaller today. So why is this called 10Base five, it's because 10 means 10 megabits per second. That's 10 megabits per second shared across this cable. So if you had two devices, they're are sharing 10 megabits per second. If you had 10 devices, they're sharing 10 megabits per second. And in the old days, you only actually got say 30% utilization of your network because of collisions. So you could never actually get 10 megabits per second, the more devices that you put on this cable, the more collisions you would take and the more contention for the cable because it's shared. So the full speed was 10 megabits per second 10Base five the base means baseband rather than broadband. This is a shared medium only one signal can traverse this cable at a time. Now this thinnet is called 10Base two. Once again 10 megabits per second baseband only one signal across the cable at any given time. This is known as 10Bass five because the cable length could be 500 meters. So that was the maximum segment length or the maximum length of a cable. This is known as 10Base two, because the maximum cable length is 200 meters. It's actually 185 but they just made it to put 200 meters to run it up. So, we have 10Base five, 10 megabits per second baseband shared medium 500 meters 10Base two 10 megabits per second, shared medium baseband 185 meters but rounded up to two and then we have 10Base-T, because this is twisted pair or Unshielded Twisted Pair cabling. So here we have UTP or Unshielded Twisted Pair 10Base-T. Here we have 10Base two, and here we have 10Bass five. Hopefully those terms make sense, so 10 megabits per second baseband rather than broadband. Broadband would allow you to have multiple signals across a cable at a given time. That's actually used on coax cables today. So if you've got cable television as an example using broadband, so multiple signals can go across a cable at a given time, but this is baseband. Only a single signal can traverse this cable at any given time. So 10Base five 10Base two and 10Base-T cabling. The different types of UTP. This is an example of Cat five or category five cabling. This is an example of category six or Cat six cabling. The higher the category, the higher the frequencies, the higher the throughput basically on UTP. But hopefully that explains what 10Base five is versus 10Base two and 10Base-T. This is once again known as thicknet because you can see how thick the cabling is. Thinnet because of how thin the cabling is. UTP Unshielded Twisted Pair is what we use today. Now in a lot of network diagrams, you'll see something like this where a PC is connected with a cable to a network something like this. So here I'm running a 10Base five network. The reason why we have this cable connected to a bus network with terminators on the end like this, is that this is called a drop cable. So in reality, the way that actually works is we have a drop cable like this. So this is a drop cable that you would connect to your transceiver. This would be connected to the cable. So with the vampire tap going into the cable as an example. Here's a example of another implementation. This is a digital H4000 Ethernet transceiver. Notice the size of this thing it's crazy big compared to for instance, a modern transceiver like this. This is a SFP, that would go into a switch as an example. So notice the size differences is massive. So here's my 10Base five cabling. vampire tap into the cable. This is a cable tron example with the vampire tap there. This is the drop cable that you would then connect to your Ethernet card. So here's an example, let me take this one. This is a PCI card, here's an ISO card. So these are two types of Ethernet cards that you'd put into your PC, ISIS or older technology PCI, or modern, still very old today. But what you'll notice here is we've got RJ45 AUY and BNC connector. So as an example, if we're using 10Base two, we would connect a T connector to that and that would give us access to the network. You never connect 10Base two, directly to that. So you would never do it this way that doesn't work, you have to use a T connector on 10Base two, but on 10Base five, what you would then do is take your drop cable, and the drop cables could be quite long, there could be 50 meters as an example. So here's my network card, that would be in my PC, I'd have a drop cable like this to my transceiver, which then as an example would be connected to the cable like this. So, I would literally use a tool, which I'll demonstrate later to cut a hole in the cable and pierce the cable with the vampire tap. And that's how it connects to the network. So very old technology. Once again, this stuff was very difficult to work with. But that's an example of a drop cable. That's why we have this here. So this would be my drop cable. This would be my bus network. It's a bus because it's one long Ethernet cable. So behind I've got three PCs, I've got my Windows 3.11 laptop, I've got two Windows eight PCs, and I've got a 2500 series router. That's the route at the bottom here. This is the end of my Ethernet cable. So, I'm gonna be connecting the router to 10Base five, using the drop cable and my transceiver onto the 10Base five network. So that's the connection over here. But I've also got two Windows PCs, one using a vampire tap directly into the cable and one using an intrusive transceiver where basically the cable is connected to the transceiver. And then a second cable is connected to the transceiver to give me a network. But that would be boring just to have a 10Base five network. So what I've done is the 10Base five network is connected to my first router. So here's my drop cable once again to the Ethernet transceiver on to the Ethernet network. So, Ethernet zero on the router is connected to 10Base five. Ethernet one on the router is connected to 10Base two. As you can see over here, 10Base two transceiver 10Base two cabling. I've got my T connectors on to the transceivers, which will allow this router and this router to communicate across 10Base two. This router is also connected to an Ethernet network that's actually connected to a switch which is on my table over there. So this switch Ethernet switch is using 10Base-T to connect two router to this middle router using 10Base two, on Ethernet one. Ethernet zero is using 10Base-T and that connects me to a Windows laptop over here also connects me via wireless to my MacBook. That means that my MacBook can control the windows 98 computers as an example and the windows 3.11 computer through wireless through this Ethernet network through 10Base two, and then 10Base five. So I've got an extra router here 2500 that's just connected using 10Base-T. This switch connects through my home network to a 1941 router, which then connects me to the internet so that those devices can have internet access. So here's my 10Base five topology, choosing subnet 10.1.1.0/24. Windows 3.11 PC or laptop has IP address 10.1.1.1. First windows 98 is 10.1.1.2. Second windows 98 is 10.1.1.3. Router has this IP address 10.1.1.254 10Base two networks very simple. It's just basically those two routers connected to each other. So router down here router one and router two are connected using this 10Base two network. They are using these two IP addresses and then I go through 10Base-T onto the internet. Now in this example, I'm controlling my windows 98 computers from my Mac using VNC. This computer on the left is this big computer here connected via 10Base five. And this one on the right is this tower over here. So rather than working on them directly, I'm controlling them via VNC. Notice what happens when I open up notepad on my Mac. That's also displayed over here. So, this one on the left is the computer here once again using 10Base five. I've only got one monitor connected at the back there, but I've got two computers. So as an example, if I open up command prompt and type IP config, I can see that the IP address of this computer is 10.1.1.2. This one on my right on my Mac, open up command prompt as IP address 10.1.1.3. They also have an additional IP address because there are two network interface cards installed in those computers. But this is the one of interest, this is the one running 10Base five. So, the tower computer can ping the other computer. And as an example, this computer can ping the tower computer, but probably what's of more interest is notice both these computers can ping google.com. So from both of them, I'm able to ping google.com. And on this computer, I'll open up Firefox as an example. Now it's running quite slow here because on using VNC across this 10Base five network. Not very quick. Computer resources are also quite low. If I go to properties, you can see that this computer has an Intel two processor and 160 mega RAM. Not gig meg of RAM, very slow. But there you go you can see I'm connected to Google using Firefox. And I'll use the command date today to see what the date is. You can see that today is Wednesday 10th of June 2020. And hopefully you can see it displayed there as well. So there's a Windows 98 computer connected to 10Base five network connected to the internet. Now for those of you that are more technical, I've got Ethereal installed on this computer. This is the predecessor to Wireshark and I can capture packets. I'll only capture ICMP packets and click okay. Can see no packets are currently captured. But what I'll do on my Mac is ping 10.1.1.2. And hopefully, we'll see those packets captured. I'll click stop. And as you can see there, I've captured traffic from 192.168.1.96 to 10.1.1.2. This Mac is on a wireless network only, and has an IP address 192.168.1.96 which is the IP address that we capturing. Local IP address of this computer is once again 10.1.1.2 on the 10Base five network. I can now view the frames. And if you work in networking, you'll notice that these frames look exactly the same as 10Base-T as an example. So we've got the source MAC address, going to a destination MAC address, you can see that it's a three com card going to a Cisco card. That's because the default gateway is the Cisco router over here. This router is routing from 10Base five to 10Base two, which is then routing us on to 10Base-T, taking me into my home network and onto my wireless network. But to prove a point here's the router. Show interface Ethernet zero. We can see the IP address is 10.1.1.254. Notice the MAC address ending in 4B:04, which is what we see over here on the windows 98 computer. Can see source IP address is 192.168.1.96, which is once again my Mac and we can see that the protocol used. I'll just make this bigger is ICMP Echo request and then the windows 98 pc reply back. So we've got an echo ping reply. Source IP addresses 10.1.1.2, destination IP addresses the Mac. We can see that we're using Ethernet two hear source MAC address is the windows 98 computer. We can see that by typing IP config slash all. We can see that this MAC address is the MAC address in the frame. And that's going to the Cisco router with this MAC address. A router will change the frames from one interface to another because we're going from a physical media here of 10Base five to another physical media of 10Base two the router changes the frame and this router will change the frame from 10Base two to 10Base-T. Okay, so what I'll do is close some of these programs down and What I'm doing here is running older software called pcAnywhere, which allows me to control this windows 3.11 laptop. Now, if you thought that dark mode was something new, notice this has been around for many, many years. There's light mode, there's dark mode on this old windows three laptop or dos laptop. But notice as an example, I'm controlling that computer through pcAnywhere, which is running on my windows 10 computer. Here I've got a DOS prompt, I'll ping google.com. And as you can see, I'm able to ping google.com from a Windows 3.11 laptop connected to 10Base five. I'll show you how this is physically connected in a moment. But I just wanted to show you that I am able to ping the internet from this computer. There's an example pinging cisco.com. From Windows 3.11 across a 10Base five network. This is how I'm connected to the internet using this laptop. Now as an example, I'll do this on Windows 98. So ping google.com with T. Here's the transceiver connected to the Cisco laptop. And what I'll do is just unscrew the terminator, and that will basically break the network. Now it's saying time out there, you probably can't see that very clearly. So I'll put that terminator back so that we can see the change. You need to have a terminator on your network. On the router as an example, we can see that we're getting excessive collisions and the interface went down on the router back on Windows. The pings are succeeding after they timed out. So let me do that from my Mac as an example. So I'll clear the screen and I'll ping 10.1.1.2, which is this Windows computer. On the Windows computer, I'll ping google.com again. So I've got ping running on the Mac and ping running on Windows 98. Let's see what happens when I disconnect the terminator. This will bring down the entire network. So, this is no longer working on my Mac. When I plug this back in again, we should get our connection back to the Windows computer. On the Windows computer you can see here as an example, that it timed out. I'll just stop that ping and then it started working again once I connected the terminator. This stuff is really hard to work with, this 10Base five cabling. You can see on the MacBook once again that the ping is succeeding. Now I'm planning a series of videos on retro networking. I've started with 10Base five. I'll talk about 10Base two, talk about other technologies. I've been able to get my hands on some Ethernet bridges, not switches, bridges. Some really old repeaters as well as multiple repeaters. Some really old technology, but I don't want to, create all these videos if it's not of interest to you. So, let me know in the comments below. Did you enjoy this video? Is this something of interest to you? I'm David Bombal. I wanna wish you all the very best. (upbeat music)",

    "transcript": "- Hey. So it's been a really long time since I've made a gaming video and I'm sorry. This is me apologizing, but as the One Republic song goes, it's too late to apologize. But to be honest, I'm not really that sorry. I still enjoy playing video games; I just don't post about it as much as I used to. Either way, I was just playing Black Ops 4 this weekend, and the private beta is out, and I was like, maybe I should just bring back some game capture, play a couple of games and post it for you guys. I don't really have a gaming channel anymore, but I still enjoy playing games. So let's play some Call of Duty Black Ops 4. I've been actually really enjoying this game. I didn't play the first weekend because I was in Hawaii. So I'm sorry I had to miss it. I had a lovely time. I have been really enjoying, oh my gosh I don't even know who. I really like Nomad 'cause I like his Mesh Mines that he does. The game has already started, okay let's roll. I've been playing the TDM Moshpit. What I mostly play, I love Free-For-All games (character yelling) (gun firing) - [Announcer] Battery Kill. - And they're so-- Oh god, oh god oh god It's me, I'm a friend, I'm a friend, I'm a friend, I'm a friend, I'm a friend, do not hurt me. There's no Free-For-All in the Beta; there's also no Hardcore, so I saw a bunch of people complaining about that. (gun firing) You're a pig; you're a hog, I hate you so much. That's one of the reasons why I don't stream live (laughs). The amount of rage that this game brings to my, to my soul. (gun firing) Oh come on. I do really well when I'm not having to talk to anybody except my teammates. Your, I don't like that. (gun firing) Where are you guys? (gun firing) Okay. (gun firing) I keep forgetting to heal. Come here. (gun firing) Walk into it, walk into it. Alright, well you're not, not falling for my trap. - [Announcer] Enemy UAV above. (beeping) - Okay c'mon you're a hog. (electricity zapping) (gun firing) Die, die, die, die hog. (pinging) (guns firing) - [Announcer] Que store's open. - Oh I see you. (gun firing) - [Announcer] Friendly Tac-Deploy Beacon offline. (guns firing) (character yelling) - [Prophet] Prophet expired. - You're a pig. I hate. Oh my god I'm doing terrible. I'm doing absolutely terrible. (guns firing in background) (grenade whistling) (gun firing) (grenade exploding) - [Announcer] Clean kill. (revive whooshing) (beeping powering up) - [Announcer] Hostile UAV circling. - Come on I just freaking got all juiced up. (guns firing) (electricity zapping) (character yelling) (helicopter blades whirring) Well at least I got a mesh mine kill. - [Announcer] Enemy UAV above. (guns firing in background) - Oh you're my friend, (gun firing) you're my friend, you're not my friend. (gun firing) - [Announcer] Neutralized Battery. (gun firing) - You're a pig. You're dead. - [Battery] Battery removed. (clicking) (guns firing) - [Announcer] Hostile UAV circling. (grenades tinging) (gun firing) (grenade exploding) - Wow that's super aggressive. (beeping powering up) (gun firing) (grenade whistling) (grenade exploding) (character yelling) This is, there's a lot going on. (gun firing) - [Announcer] Enemy UAV above. - (sighs) I never get score streaks because I kill somebody, then they kill me and then it's just, repeat, repeat, repeat. Because I get so... (guns firing in background) Well just... I get, I get flustered. (gun firing) You're my friend, you're my friend. (gun firing) Oh and we lost. - [Announcer] Think I'm feeling buyer's remorse. - That was a warm-up. It was, let's, let's play another one shall we? Time to talk to my; I'm not talking to anybody (laughs) but this looks silly up here. - [Announcer] Kill confirmed. - Okay, Kill Confirmed. - [Announcer] Fight, - Let's collect. win, profit. - Collect, uh I should stay with my friends but I have not. Oh my god no one, is somebody with me? Okay, good, I've got a friend. Okay would you-- (guns firing in background) We can't all go in there at once. Like don't be stupid. No. (guns firing) I get so freaking upset that I just start hitting buttons. (character yelling) (guns firing) (growls) Me so mad. Okay, you make me so mad. (gun firing) - [Announcer] We have the advantage. - (sighs) Do we, do we, excellent. - [Recon] Sensor online. (guns firing) - Don't you kill me; let me kill you. You freaking pig. (guns firing) God no. - [Announcer] Enemy's Deploy beacon offline. - Son of a biscuit, badger, - [Seraph] Utilizing Tac-Deploy. - Baby, in a bottle. (gun firing) Goodbye. - [Announcer] Our Tac-Deploy beacon is offline. (gun firing) - I'm gonna get this. I'm confirming this, I'm confirming this, oh my god, somebody else confirmed it (laughs). I'm worthless (laughs). Okay, (gun firing) who wants to die today? (gun firing) Mommy's got a machete (laughs). I wanted to make that, no that's not funny. (helicopter blades whirring) I so wanted to make that a T-shirt. I don't even remember when I first said that. I think I said it at a GO Team video but I think I edited it out 'cause I was like, that's not really; moms shouldn't have machetes (laughs). I don't know, I've lost my mind. (gun firing) - [Seraph] Cyber asset down. (gun firing) - Oh really, oh cool. Hey, hey, hey, it's fine, - [Announcer] Lost control. - just un-confirm my kill that I got. It's like you do all this work for nothing. It's like shut up. (gun firing) (character yelling) Suck a brisket (laughs). Son of a bulldog (growls). (gun firing) Son of a, - [Announcer] Our Tac-Deploy beacon has been destroyed. - something. Son of a something. I'm angry, I'm mad, I'm upset about it (laughs). I'm gonna hear about it in the comments; you suck, you suck at Call of shut up. That's what, that's what I have to say to you, shut your mouth I'm enjoying myself, I'm having a fun time. Don't ruin my fun. - [Announcer] Our Tac-Deploy beacon has been destroyed. - You pig, okay. (gun firing) Don't ruin my fun just shut, shut it. Well granted I died, oh god, I'm totally not doing very well. - [Announcer] Hostile UAV circling. - Maybe I deserve it. (helicopter blades whirring) My camera's probably gonna overheat. My body's gonna overheat 'cause I'm so sassed up. (gun firing) (grenade whistling) (grenade exploding) No, I don't wanna get lighting. I don't wanna get lit. Man, every other game I've played, I, well my K/D was like positive and now I'm just doing really bad and I'm feeling upset and sad. This is why I don't record games, because I don't like talking, I just, (character yelling) I fell to my death (laughs). This is why I don't freaking records guys. I play like a freaking champion and then I turn the stupid camera on and then I suck. I hate it. (guns firing) You're ruining everything. Maybe I can do better. No, my team isn't even winning (laughs). Oh god, trash content. (guns firing) - [Announcer] Hostile UAV circling. (guns firing) - [Announcer] Our Tac-Deploy - I'm. - Beacon has been destroyed. (gun firing) - Oh okay, okay well that's definitely something that's happening right now. (grenades tinging) Whatever. (gun firing) Eat it, ya hog. Want some dinner? (character yelling) I just wanted to confirm my freaking kill. I don't care, I just needed it for myself. - [Announcer] Enemy Strike Team deployed. (guns firing) (character yelling) - Got any oh God no. Get away from me you stupid, (exclaims). (gun firing) Yeah, okay I, I actually wasn't paying attention to be honest with you. I was thinking about dinner. (grenade exploding) I was like hmm, I should probably order Postmates now, 'cause I'm probably gonna be hungry probably like two and a half hours (laughs). (character yelling) So I walk into battle (laughs). - [Recon] Lighting up targets. - (Exaggerated inhale) Oh god, alright. (guns firing) I'm confirming kills boys. Are you gonna tell me that I didn't kill a single one of those people like that's. (guns firing) Maybe I need a different gun. It's like, (revive whooshing) things are not working in my favor right now. (gun firing) Yeah, let's maybe, maybe that's the problem. (dogs barking) Okay, lets do uh. Please don't kill me. Okay I like Prophet. Okay, okay I'm glad. You wanna, you wanna be a hog? Let's see what we can do. (guns firing) (character yelling) Well that didn't help. - [Announcer] Hostile UAV circling. - [Character] Obsolete. (guns firing) - I'm, - [Announcer] Enemy Hellstorm detected. - I'm just shooting (grenade exploding) into nothing. I'm shooting into nothing. You're my friend. - [Torque] Throwing Barricade. - You're not my friend. Oh god, well, hey nice - [Announcer] Tac-Comm, Recon requesting HellStorm strike. - Nice try, not. Here's my, here you go, get, get my Segway. My Segway is on its way, on its way. You killed him; I wanted him. (gun firing) Mm hmm that's trash. That's absolute garbage.

I am actually in my office. - [Announcer] We have the advantage. - Great, good work guys. I haven't done anything yet. (clicking) Yeah, get 'em Razor Wire. (gun firing) - [Character] That's a kill. - It is, not that it matters. (guns firing) You're gonna tell me that's not gonna do anything? Yeah, I just give you a jab jab to the face. (gun firing) - [Character] Our Shield's ready to dig in. - Dig in. (gun firing) - [Announcer] Enemy expired. - Well I'm just running around in circles here, waiting for someone who wants to die.

Are we just gonna wait in here for them? - [Crash] Crash requesting Strike Team deploy. - Okay. I don't wanna wait. (guns firing) (helicopter blades whirring) Wow. What have you done? Cool, well great job team. I applaud your efforts. - [Announcer] Mission complete, nice work. - I think you're all really great people and I appreciate you. Ooh that's, ooh I like that gun. (sighs) Oh boy, I hope my teammates are up for carrying me a little bit more. Like, it's drifting. It's freaking drifting and it's driving me crazy. I wonder if it's just this controller. - [Announcer] Represent the Company, make us proud. - Okay boys and girls put me in your backpack, carry me to victory. (guns firing) - [Ajax] Ajax dropped. Enemy down. (guns firing) - [Character] Firebreak dead. - No. Oh god. (revive whooshing) (gun firing) No ho ho. I'm , you, you crazy. I'm outta here.

Like this game, everything about it just makes me freaking angry and I just wanna yell obscenities and I can't because I am-- Oh god (laughs). (guns firing) Back up buddy, Mommy's coming out tonight (laughs). (guns firing) - [Character] Firebreak kill. (character yelling) - [Character] Ruin neutralized. - Well, the whole freaking team is here (guns firing) and ready to kill us. So, what do we do about it?

'Cause let's be real. - [Announcer] We've lost the advantage. - Come on. - [Character] Deploying Seeker Mine. (guns firing) - There's my little package. (gun firing) You're an idiot.

Are you gonna tell me I was so, I was shooting right through his brain and nothing happened? (gun firing) - [Character] Eyes on headshots. - That's the whole team, so. So, let's be patient.

And I wear it super tight so I can get my heart rate. I wish that I had it on though because my heart rate during this game, it probably would alert me to go to the hospital. Well, I thank you so much for watching, everybody's enjoyed a little bit of gameplay. I have been enjoying this game so much and I can't wait until it actually comes out. So, I will see you guys on the battlefield or maybe I won't, I don't know. That's the end of the video. It got dark since I started recording this (laughs), bye. (\"Flashing Lights\" by Daxten)",

    "transcript": "I'm currently standing outside my local Best Buy because I was wondering what kind of gaming system they'll build for somebody who wants a custom gaming system but doesn't really know what they're looking for the problem is I look like the kind of person that first felt the touch of a woman when I was like 25 cuz I was too busy fondling a graphics guy so there's no way they're going to think that I don't know what I'm looking for but luckily I'm not 25 anymore and I know an Anna yeah yeah Anna oh there you [Music] go so Anna what's your Strat my Strat is going to be to ask them to build me a PC because I don't want to do that okay and I want to be able to play League of Legends with some friends maybe stream a little so the computer's got to be able to like do that at least and then in terms of budget what are you going to give them I'm going to say about $1,400 Canadian so the reason that we kind of I mean we pred decided on $11,400 but the reason is because I kind of did a quick look at their website and it doesn't seem like they've got a lot of budget options hopefully they're even going to be able to build it for that amount but we'll see it was a weird experience the first person who helped me was really formed she was like okay for your budget you want to get a 30 series card with an i5 1100 series 1100k okay Vibes anyway and so then she goes okay this guy's going to help you he'll make sure everything's compatible and then he goes uh onto the floor and starts picking out components but he's just like okay 30 series cards out of stock I had originally given a budget of 1,400 we ended up with just over $1,700 Canadian dollar for the components before tax the whole process of like sourcing all of the things probably took about 25 minutes 30 minutes okay then they had to go and figure out how much it would cost for them to build the system for us okay and the problem with that was they didn't know what the skew number was so they didn't know how like how much to charge for it and for for the actual building process when the person that actually knew the skew showed up it turns out they charge $150 Canadian dollars to build the system which is almost double what a place like Canada computer charges for the same service but wait they weren't done yet after which she told me that okay they actually don't build computers for non-geek Squad members she was like you have to get the membership so that we can also look after it if stuff like if stuff goes wrong and then how much is the membership so the membership is 20 bucks a month or 2 240 a year plus tax so it was more like 260 bucks a year and you can't cancel it and like if you do month a month you have to pay so you have to do a year subscription to their membership for them to build you a system so not only do you have to pay them $150 to build the system for you you also have to get a $20 a month subscription you know just in case something maybe goes wrong with it and they have to look at it which means at the end of the first year you've paid them $400 to build you a gaming system that was already $400 over budget well I mean hopefully they build the living crap out of that system so I think you said it's 2 days and then we can pick up our brand new Best Buy PC now it's been 2 days since Anna was initially extorted by Best Buy and the system's not done yet but she did get a phone call saying that they made Anna buy the wrong Ram uh they got Anna to buy ddr4 but the motherboard only supports ddr5 which means you guessed it Anna has to give Best Buy even more money now because it was their mistake they did give Anna a $50 discount on the ramp but she does still need to pay an additional $50 when she picks up the gaming system they also very excitedly realized that Anna hasn't paid for a Windows license yet which they wanted to charge her $240 Canadian dollar for luckily Anna told them she already has a Windows key so we don't need to pay that additional amount so at least we dodged that bullet uh but now we just need to wait and see how long it takes them to finally finish the system now the process of picking up our Best Buy gaming system from the very nice but quite slow Best Buy Builder people was a mixed bag on the one hand they didn't use one of the packs of fans that they got us to buy so we got a little bit of a discount on the system cuz they just took the fans back which puts our total for the components about $260 over budget if you don't take into account the tax and the absurd amount they charged us to build the system on the other hand they did do some interesting things to the windows install which they showed Anna and we'll have a look at in a little bit oh there's a big spider that camera is not mine anymore it belongs to the spider now now in terms of case we got a thermal take s200 which according to the box has actual airflow now on top they don't quite seem to know their way around a PC box it is in the the wrong way around but it's not like it was being shipped anywhere so I guess that's fine we also get our Wi-Fi antenna pre-installed [Music] okay on first impression it seems like they didn't do a terrible job assembling the system we did pay them $400 to do it so anything less than Immaculate is completely unacceptable but still and in terms of IO the system does decently we've got some USB 3 on the front although no type-c although the I/O on the tough gaming motherboard they used kind of makes up for it 2.5 gbit ethernet ooh we can download League of Legends real fast they also used hella power supply which is kind of hard to be mad about oh wow that just limply falls off when looking inside it seems like a well putut together system the only thing approaching I guess weirdness is that they used both CPU 8 pins that's not a bad thing it just isn't necessary so I I don't even know why I'm pointing it out to be honest but they made some effort to hide fan cables behind places and down here all of the front panel connectors are plugged in and hidden away nicely they could have shortened this run a bit and tucked more of it away but again that's really splitting hairs at this point now in terms of specs I'm not sure what CPU they used going by the z790 motherboard it's some current gen Intel CPU we get a thermal take ux 200 air cooler which funnily enough another customer in line with Anna had to remind the Best Buy people to get a CPU Cooler also when Anna picked up the system the technician who tested it said he was a bit worried about CPU temperatures butang changed some settings in the Bios to address that which we'll have a look at a bit later next to that is our problem child Corsair Vengeance ddr5 kit which is rated at 6,000 MHz motherboard wise they used a tough gaming z790 plus Wi-Fi and then the graphics card is a PNY version of the RTX 4060 with a pretty losery looking cooler on it so it it's quite a base model of one but with that let's take the back panel off and see what's going on over there that rear cable management is perfectly acceptable good job Geek Squad person and another nice touch is they saved us the peel oh yeah so when it comes to First Impressions Mr Geek Squad did a reasonable job the main complaint is still that they massively overp the system for our given use case however these were the cheapest components they had available and for some reason ordering other ones wasn't an option we also had to pay $400 for them to build it but with that let's see how it runs ooh it's so RGB who they really went to town installing crap on this system there's like multiple versions of Bit Defender and with the same logic as somebody wearing two condoms we've got another acronis antivirus on here I'm very curious to see what this Geek Squad setup guide is oh yeah and I was telling me about this these are the product ke for all the syphilis included in the membership we were forced to buy so I guess it's nice of them to give us that oh they even installed VLC clearly trying real hard to justify that $20 a month subscription but then I noticed something they forgot no way so they installed all of this crap on but they forgot to do anything above the like standard Windows setup driver install and the drivers that Windows Auto installed was almost a year old so after all of that they forgot to install the one important thing for a gaming system although on the bright side they did enable xmp's on the ram so that's better than most pre-built companies oh and in terms of SSD we get quite a fancy 1 TB drive and the CPU is an i5 14600 K which actually I wonder if they updated the BIOS on this motherboard they did not update the BIOS which isn't necessarily a problem the main recent stability issues with Intel chips seems to mainly affect like I9 and some i7s so the CPU in here should be okay oh and these are the settings that Mr Geek Squad changed in the Bios to try and deal with the temperatures they switch the Boost profile from asus's boost profile to the default Intel one okay so let's see if that's worked so I'm starting off with doom maternal at 1080p ultra settings and the system is crushing it getting over 200 frames per second I mean it makes sense it is a 4060 this is going to be a fast system wow it's so smooth this is a 240 Herz monitor so actually taking advantage of that extra frame rate and oh so much of the smoothness now in terms of what the system is doing the CPU doesn't have to do a huge amount to keep up with our graphics card uh which does mean that our temperatures are pretty good the graphics card is also doing okay despite its tiny loser little cooler the system has absolutely no problem running Esports titles like CS2 at 1080p low settings of course this is the case though it's about as surprising as a dragon fly successfully murdering a thing now aside from Esports titles don't worry we'll get to League of Legends uh but with more demanding games like cyberpunk here running at 1080p High settings lots of frame rate 90 frames per second is is a lot it feels very good and and it looks great as you can see from the frame time graph as well it's smooth you know it's there's not much stuttering going on and if we want some rate tracing action here with r tracing on medium uh we just need to use a little bit of dlss we're currently using quality and we're getting over 60 frames per second so that option exists as well if you're interested in slightly different looking light it looks very very slightly different and when The Last of Us was building it some shaders we got a taste of what 100% CPU load does to the temperatures and the answer is the hell end of Venus so for gaming the temperatures are fine on the CPU but for productivity the temperatures are definitely not eping the last of us does run very well at 1080p High settings with good frame rates and everything looking all Fidelity but that's not what we asked Best Buy for we ask them for a system to run some League of Legends so let's see how it handles that now as an adult I don't really play League of Legends so I have no idea who to pick but I guess I'll go with the one that looks like a shadow feiend ripoff now a 1080p very High settings with the system making the Bots happen we're pegged at 240 frames per second and it seems like the system doesn't even realize there's a game happening look at that utilization it is basically not doing anything I mean look at the look at the GPU frequency it's like not doing anything wait you can't deny creeps so laning is just free farming at each other that's what I then pushed the resolution up to 1440p which did not phase the system one bit but it did seem to realize something was happening this time but then I remembered that Anna briefly mentioned wanting to stream on the system so I fired up some OBS set up a very basic thing and well again the system barely noticed I started off streaming using enven as the encoder which unsurprisingly didn't impact the performance despite the fact that we were streaming and recording at the same time again the system was basically idle even switching the encoding over to the CPU with a fast quality preset the system barely noticed it didn't impact the performance at all and we were still getting very little utilization now again I was using about as basic a streaming setup as you could use but Anna just wanted to dabble in streaming so I think this is a realistic test so with that should you have Best Buy build your next gaming system not even almost just the fact that they force you into a monthly subscription is enough to deserve a cruel and unus usual corporal punishment and aside from the extreme cost for them to build you the system their tiny part selection meant that the salesperson pressured Anna into getting a system outside of her budget during the painfully slow and frustrating ordering process they may have done a reasonable job assembling the system but no I'd rather buy an Xbox than pay them $400 to build me a system which brings me to the end of the video thank you for watching subscribe to the channel if you liked it watch another video suggestion will pop up in a second and until the next one bye-bye I look like the kind of person that hasn't felt the touch of a woman but oh I'm his wife we're walking down okay okay [Music]",

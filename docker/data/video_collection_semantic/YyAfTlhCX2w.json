    "transcript": "- Wait, how am I gonna do this? (groans) Hey guys, this is Austin. And this very well might be the most overkill gaming monitor of all time. This is the 49 inch Samsung QLED Gaming Monitor. Do not open here. Open opposite side. (laughs) I have to do that whole thing again now? I just saw there's a little label on the side of the box that this is Samsung DeX compatible. Yeah, of course, what else would you wanna connect your Galaxy S8 to, other than a 49 inch gaming monitor. I'm gonna have to set this down for a second. Woo! That's better. So we get what looks like a bracket to mount it, as well as a ton of cables. Wow, all right. I think you should really say something when the monitor stand is bigger than most other monitors by themselves. Dude, this is so heavy. It's like everything about this monitor is what you expect to see, except twice as big and twice as ridiculous. Oh! It's so heavy. (laughing) Did I mention that this is a curved monitor? (laughing) What am I doing? Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on. How are you supposed to do this? I don't even have enough room here. And now we've got the full 32 by nine QLED Gaming Monitor out of the packaging. This... I feel like I'm just repeating myself, but this is the most ridiculous thing ever. I mean, look at that. Oh! Oh! This is a wall bracket. You know, when you wanna mount your 49 inch gaming monitor to the wall. Hey Jimmy. - [Jimmy] Yeah? - Can I borrow you for a second? Are we secure right now? - Yeah. - Is this going to break when I try to pick it up? - [Jimmy] Jimmy certified it. - All right, Jimmy certified. This is actually the first time that a product has broken our filming area. It's literally just too big. Like, it just doesn't fit anywhere. So around back, not only are you getting a pair of HDMI ports, but you're also getting display port, mini display port, audio in, audio out, as well as two more USB 3.0 ports. But the real star of the show is well, this side. So, with everything set up you can see that this, this is something special. So the resolution of this guy is 3840 by 1080. So you can essentially think of this as two 1080 monitors. So to take a couple of windows here, I easily have enough room for say, that, throw up a web browser over on this side. There's just so much room for activities. (laughing) Okay, well, so one of my questions with this would be do any games actually support this ridiculous 32 by nine aspect ratio? As you can see, CS:GO kind of does. I don't know why it's slowly expanding out here, but we've got it for the most part. This is ridiculous. So, in a game like CS:GO you're seeing that, especially on the edges, it actually looks like it's almost a bit of a fish eye effect. But that is so trippy. I feel like I'm almost playing this in VR just because it completely takes up my peripheral vision. Making things even better is that not only does this support 144 hertz refresh rate, which really does sort of add to the immersion, but it also is a freesync enabled display. So right now I'm playing on a little bit of a lower end system with an RX480, but I'm still getting like, 140-150 frames per second. Definitely enough to saturate the monitor and... Oh! It's so cool! Especially in CS:GO, you can see it; some things are a little bit oddly shaped. For example, the map and some of the HUD elements look a little bit warped just because they are so stretched across such a giant monitor. But that's a small price to pay for having something that looks this awesome. Next, we have PUBG. However, there's a problem. Not only is his head slightly cut off, but the settings menu doesn't exactly work on this monitor. So let's see if this actually will work. All right, so in the game it seems like everything is running reasonably well. I will say though, that it is very obvious that this a crop. So even though we're running at the full resolution, you can see that like, a lot of the bottom and the top of the screen have been cut off. So instead of getting something that's wider we're actually just getting something that's been sort of chopped. But I'm curious to see how that actually affects game playing. That crop is actually really serious. I'm basically only seeing from his shoulders up. You know, for a game like PUBG, yeah, it's probably not gonna be the end of the world. It is nice to be able to kinda see a little bit of a wider field of view, but it's not quite that same experience without being able the pull out the POV. I get it, they don't wanna give people an unfair advantage by having a super wide monitor, but I also don't like the idea of having so much of this cropped. Performance-wise though, it's not too bad. With this system, we did crank it down to low settings, but because we have freesync everything is pretty smooth, even though we're around 40 to 50 frames per second. I can't get away from the idea that this looks really cool. Oh, oh no! Oh no! No! Don't wreck the truck! Don't wreck the truck! No! (laughing) Oh, this is fun. Oh, yeah. So now we have GTA 5 and actually again, this is a game that does seem to support that full aspect ratio. I'm actually kind of impressed by how well games are supported by this. So not only is it kinda cool to be able to get that wider field of view, but you also have to keep in mind that it's not going to be that crazy to drive. Sure it is a very, very large monitor, but it's only a 3840 by 1080 display. That's going to be wide, but it's really not going to be that much more than something like say, a 1440p monitor. And of course, with freesync, if you do have an AMD graphics card you're going to be getting those extra smooth frame rates. Next up we have DiRT 4. Now I feel like a racing game is really perfect for something like this to get that full widescreen experience. Now the menus don't support the full resolution, but I'm hoping the game does. If not, I'm gonna be really disappointed. Yes! This is so cool. Yeah, this is totally perfect. I mean, honestly, I keep making the comparison with a VR headset. But it does kind of feel like that. Obviously it's not that fully immersive experience, but you're getting something that is pretty much taking up your whole field of view. You know what? I'm gonna give Samsung props. This is a ridiculous monitor. Very, very few people are probably going to buy it. But, it's just cool. I'm just glad that someone just decided, hey, let's take a pair of super high refresh rate monitors, glue them together and make some giant monstrosity that actually is kind of cool. No, scratch that. It's really cool. So, does anyone actually need a 49 inch gaming monitor? Of course not. But, I will say it's actually not as impractical as I thought it would be. Yeah, it's gonna be a little bit unwieldy and you do have to have a pretty decent PC to drive it, but it's actually really pretty well done. So as always, the link to check this guy out will be in the description. I'm curious, what do you think about this overkill monster? Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you in the next one.",

    "transcript": "- Hey, how's it going? Today, we're unboxing this new headset. I did a quick Google to get some information. Direct pairing to console, exceptional sound, they're light and flexible. Best in class audio performance, low latency for chat, which is also very important, comfortable, intuitive design. It also says it's tailored to you. To me? I think that we just need to open it. (paper tears) (cardboard scrapes) Congrats on being one of the first people to receive the all new Xbox wireless headset, which delivers a... This is all the stuff I just said. Voice isolation, helps pick up your voice and not the background noise, auto mutes. I love that. Play wirelessly across multiple devices, including Xbox Series X, S, One, Windows 10, connect to your mobile device for Bluetooth for on-the-go music. Where am I going? I go to my fridge, I go to my couch. Little headset. This looks nice. (Justine gasps) Oh. Oh, this is custom. This is custom. Look, it's got my little name on it. Oh, look at you, look at you. I'm glad that they put the left and right, because we all know I have problems with that. This is Ida Fivetine reporting for duty. Is anybody there? Hello? Look at this nice, little stand. Like, this looks incredible. Whoa, it just turned on. These are little dials. So, there's something happening in my head right now. I think it's looking for my Xbox. It's downstairs. I'll take you downstairs in a second. Just, could you hold on a second? So, it looks like, on this side, we have a volume dial, so this will adjust your overall volume. We've got USB-C right here for charging. We've got our mic button right here. It looks like this side here will be your mix between game and voice chat, so that's cool that all of this is basically accessible right here on your headset. They're actually very comfortable too. Like, I'm comfy, I'm cozy. Start the game, start the game, start the game. (lively electronic music) (dramatic orchestral music) Here we go. Okay, am I yelling? I'm not sure. It's so loud, like, in my head. Can you hear me? I mean, I can, you can't, I can hear a lot. Oh, Saint Patrick's stockpile. Free for all is my favorite game mode. Let's show these noobs what's up. Can anybody hear me? Can anybody hear me talking? Do you wanna be my friend? Do you wanna fight? So there's a little light here, and this will let you know if your mic is on or off, and there's a little mic switch button right there on the bottom. Oh, you're my friend, you're my friend, you're my friend. Hello? Can anybody hear me? Please confirm, confirm or deny. Oh my gosh, oh my gosh. Oh, look at this pot of gold. Freaking get it, dude. Get the gold. Oh, oh, oh, that's my body on the floor. They let it hit. Oh, stupid idiot. I just spit all over myself. (Justine laughs) I'm a disgusting hog. So I missed the memo on how to play the game, and I did not deposit. I did not deposit. I have to deposit at least something, because this is embarrassing. Freaking idiot. The game's half over, and I just figured out how to play. I gotta go back to free for all. This is not for me. Mommy has a care package, so get after it, get after it. Where do I stick my clover? Ah. Yep, yep. Yep, you're dead, you're dead, you're dead. (Justine laughs) Let's go. Please don't respawn. I gotta stick my clover in the pot. (Justine laughs) This is easy. I don't wait for anything. I just, like, stick it in. (Justine laughs) Now I'm freaking figuring it out, and the game's gonna be over. Oh, we both killed each other. This is fun. I'm enjoying it. Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. How long is this game? My god. Saint Patrick's Day is gonna be over. Where's that pot? We lost. I yelled a lot. Was it loud, do you think? - [Man] Yeah. - I was pretty loud? I was pretty loud, yeah. - [Man] Very. - Well, I couldn't hear myself. - [Man] No, I didn't think you could. - Did you say anything to me? - [Man] I tried once. (Justine laughs) - Well, these sound really incredible. I'm actually quite surprised, and also, they're very comfortable, super comfy, super cushiony, a perfect fit. I like that it has the big, bold lettering in the inner ear cups here, and here's the microphone, so you can see there's, like, a little light. Like, look at this. You can turn it on and you can turn it off so you'll easily be able to see kind of, like, out of her peripheral vision if it's on or off, and I like that these dials are very easy to turn. One is for volume, and one is for a mix between the volume and chat, so, if you are hanging out, chatting with some people, you'll be able to adjust that volume very easily. You've got your power button here, you got these soft, cushiony little ear cups, and also, this is really soft, too, the top little headband. And it just looks cool. I just wanna give you guys a quick look at the new Xbox headset. I'm super excited about this. I would love to hear from you guys. Did you order them? Are you gonna get them? If not, which headsets are you guys currently using for your gaming setup? Would love to read those in the comments below. See you in the next video. (screen beeps) - [Man] Give me a test. (Justine smacks lips) - Hello. (Justine smacks lips) - [Man] Good test. - Today, we're unboxing something that you can see on the front here. All right, let's just... I'll just take another sip. Okay. (Justine laughs) (Justine laughs) Ah. This is my full-time job. (Justine laughs) I can't do anything. I can't do anything.",

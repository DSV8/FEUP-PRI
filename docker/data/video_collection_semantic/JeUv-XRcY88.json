    "transcript": "in this box is a very interesting graphics card and it has an equally fascinating origin story it involves well I'm not going to tell you what it involves because I think someone else can tell this story a lot better than I can Mr dabs whose graphics card this actually is so thank you very much dapps for sending the card over dapps would have posted his origin story video go check it out because we're not going to cover it in today's video what we're gonna do with this graphics card is the only thing I know how to do with a graphics card which is use it unreasonably you know it's going well when it can barely render the Low video memory warning thank you now with all the suspense building out the way in this box we have an Nvidia GT 1010 not at 10 30 not a 710 a 10 10 which is a graphics card that's existence is very ethereal and honestly at this point I'm still not entirely sure that there isn't just a fart in this box but we'll open it up and find out soon enough in here we have oh a box that Mr dabs left in here just the docks himself very good job dabs well done and in this I'm thinking is the graphics card now apparently our merchandise has been carefully inspected by Apple which is a bit weird what now as you can tell from the packaging this graphics card clearly wasn't bought from like a Micro Center and as far as I understand the process of getting this graphics card from China was very difficult and involved smuggling inside various UPS delivery people so I'm really excited to test it out um feels a bit damped in here and then in this Grocery Store bag we have oh the beauty look at that physically as you can tell the GT 1010 is a Herculean Behemoth of a graphics card and I'm sure the performance will be the same in terms of rear IO the GT 1010 is a little different to its bigger brother the 10 30. we have a Mesozoic period port on the back and an HDMI port whereas on the back of the 1030 It's All Digital with a DVI port for whatever that's worth physically though aside from the oemness of the 1010 the two cards are very clearly related and those similarities persist in terms of specs the 1010 is based on the same GPU as the 1030 just with some Shader units disabled in all fairness performance wise the 1030 can't really afford a lobotomy but we'll see how they stack up later on interestingly just like its older brother the 1010 is available in both a gddr5 version and a runty ddr4 version a fact that caused me a tiny bit of confusion later on in the video but with that let's drop the 1010 in the system and see how it's recovered from its lobotomy now the system I'm using to test the Monstrous GT 1010 is this pink Madness build in the NES gochan case it's got a fast modern AMD CPU in it and a bunch of ram so we can be a hundred percent sure the test system won't restrain the power of the gt-1010 oh I just noticed it looks like the connector just has like four pcie lanes interesting oh yes I think the GT 1010 fits in beautifully in this system now I think by far the most reasonable monitor we can use to test the GT 1010 is this Behemoth LG 48 4K OLED panel from the previous video it just seems like a perfect match but before we try some 4K gaming on the 1010 let's ease it in a little now to GTA 5 running a 1080p low settings this is not bad now I was not expecting it to be this playable but I clearly was just underestimating the power of the GT 1010 because look at that like 1080p GTA 5 is running well visually 1080p low stretched over a massive 4K display doesn't look great but at least we have some performance left in the tank for Native 4K gaming which we'll get to in a bit Yeah my memory of GT 1030 performance is clearly unfair because this 1010 is running games well CS go with 1080p low settings is playable we don't even have that much input like it's pretty good there's just no other way to say it the GT 1010 is a voracious Beast churning out a strong 35-ish frames per second at 1080p low exaggeration aside it is still running Battlefield 5. I wouldn't want to play online like this but I I think it's pretty impressive and after being impressed by a couple frames per second I tried cyberpunk which seems to have been a game too far because it just refused to launch I think at this point it's a good time to drop in the GT 1030 which is its slightly bigger brother and see how the two compare before we try some 4K gaming on the 1010. now we've got the GT 1030 in here which I'm assuming is going to be at least what 20 better than the 1010 um why is it running at like half the frame rate the 1010 did that doesn't make any sense the 1010 has a smaller number in the name surely it's slower now the reason this was happening was because I used a ddr4 1030 because I assumed the 1010 used ddr4 so when I messaged apps telling him what a giguchad his 1010 was he was like yeah it's because it's a gddr5 version you idiot which is a bit embarrassing and concerning because I didn't think I had a gddr5 1030 to compare it to or did I a few moments later so I just dug this naked and Confused gddr5 1030 out of a random bin in my office I don't know what happened to its cooler I'm not even sure if it still works at this point so what I'm gonna do is transplant the cooler from the ddr4 1030 onto it and then hopefully we have a more reasonable competitor for the 1010 oh wow that just came off look at those pathetic ddr4 loser modules it makes me sick anyway let's try the other card oh look at the tiny little baby GT 1030 die oh that's a very big problem despite them both being gigabyte cards the cooler mounting doesn't line up between the two it's a little Annoying although I actually think I remember what happened to the cooler for the gddr5 1030. so the reason the card was naked was because I used its heatsink as a CPU Cooler so I ended up splicing a different cable onto the fan of it which actually means this cooler is not gonna work on the graphics card anymore I think what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna remove this fan and replace it with the fan on the ddr4 version and then we'll have the correct connector and stuff so let's see if that works like that that's really annoying the two heatsinks are identical the only thing they changed was where the mounting holes are at least the fans are interchangeable so that helps yay it's finally got its dignity back but now we need to see if the bin corpse still works PC's been on a while the monitor is on but there's no signal out it's not promising no yeah it doesn't work I think that's why I used it cooler yeah it doesn't work oh it does it was just debating me oh thank you okay yes that makes a whole lot more sense and basically what we've learned from today's video is that the ddr4 version of the GT 1030 is complete garbage clearly this is running a little bit better than the GT 1010 and when it comes to CS go and Battlefield 5 the improvements in performance were slightly less minor but still not massive but enough of that let's do something terrible to the gt1010 this is 4K with everything else on low settings but it's a GT 1010 and it's it's running fine like it's not the most amazingly playable experience but like I I don't think GTA 5 ran this well on the PS3 even CS Go is is kind of playable I mean I wouldn't want to use this to play competitive CS go but you can like shoot bots in the face and it doesn't feel too horrible okay that's a that's a great start a few moments later that's not a warning I've ever seen from Battlefield 5 before I guess it's just telling us no like I I do not want to do this with your graphics card next up I try to launch Forza at 4K which went very well you know it's going well when it can barely render the Low video memory warning I then spent quite some time struggling to get into the settings so that I could address the warning so up once press the button now we're leaving it we don't want to Spook it and accidentally skip over there we go it's happening now I think it's fully selected settings after some more struggling I identified the problem why is it all on Ultra I don't know why the game thought it needed to preset everything to ultra that seems a little bit Brave eventually though I got Forza running at 4k on the 1010 and with the little GT 1010 and everything in low settings we can actually get about 12 frames per second at 4K I don't know what I'm saying that like it's an achievement we do have a very special tool at our disposal and that is FSR two point two I think it said it was let's start with quality it is now running worse than it it was running before why did that happen we lost more than half of our frame rate I feel like it should be the other way around um let's try Ultra performance see again it just it makes the game look worse but also run worse I don't it's the worst of Both Worlds hell yeah that's amazing okay oh yes my favorite potato Vindicator Half-Life 2. I would be very surprised if the GT 1010 can't run this well at 4K especially considering how good the GTA 5 performance was it's always impressive how how well Half-Life 2 manages to run at very high resolutions on potato systems and it's no exception with the GT 1010 hey even in the like air boat section we're getting over a hundred frames per second which you know this is the hardest bit of Half-Life to render so that's it's quite impressive and this isn't even at low settings this is 4K mostly High although if you remember the RX 6400 which is like amd's newer version of this card basically kind of I guess uh that could do this at 8K which is a much higher resolution so yeah maybe maybe the 1010 isn't that that beastly but at least it's a decent bit faster than a modern Intel I GPU for whatever that's worth and with that thank you very much dapps for sending over the GT 1010 don't forget to check out his origin story video it really is pretty wild and uh yeah until the next video thank you for watching bye foreign",

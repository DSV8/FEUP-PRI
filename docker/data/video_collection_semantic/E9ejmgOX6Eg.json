    "transcript": "Woah, what year is it? I've beenI've been lost in the wilderness forfor four weeks! [in background] No, you've beenyou've been at home home. We've seen you at home. You've been streaming. Maybe this isn't as funny as I thought it was. NVIDIA has announced that Jensen Huang, and his leather jacket will be gracing us with their presence on May the 14th at the GTC 2020 Keynote. Now, it was supposed to take place in March, but it was pushed back a little bit, due to the pandemic sit-u-mulation [situation], to the chagrin of many, who were anticipating possible news about a new lineup of graphics cards. however, we may not be getting any news specifically about the RTX 3080, as the topic roundup posted on NVIDIA's website specifically mentions \"Professional Graphics.\" Ahthe Esportsareprplayers are professionals, okay! Anyway, it looks like NVIDIA will be announcing its Ampere architecture, as well as talking about its forays into autonomous driving, and AI So, you'll at least have something to look forward to between your trips to... Costco, and... [in background] Don't go th [Linus] the bathroom. [in background] Don't go there. We're still waiting for Intel to launch a challenge to NVIDIA and AMD in the form of its own discrete graphics cards, but we may get a glimpse of what the future has in store very soon[!], as Team Blue has announced integrated graphics based on their new Xe architecture, and they will be appearing sometime in mid 2020. This week, Intel CEO said that the new integrated GPUs will be available in over 50 laptops this year and the CPUs themselves will be based on a 10 nanometer process, something Intel has notoriously been having trouble with for a hot minute, here. Although until does have a lineup of Ice Lake 10 nanometer parts for laptops already, distribution has been somewhat limited. So, looks like those new Tiger Lake chips should be more widely available, and so hopefully they can be out in the wild without getting snatched up by Joe exoticsis a tiger Kingdom joke? Really? [in background] Yeah, look, [in background] he's in jail, so I think they're safe Hmm... [laughter in background] Of course, many of the innovations we've seen in recent years have been thanks to shrinking transistor sizes, and it looks like a leading chip maker is going to be pushing the limits of how small we can make them even further. According to a report, TSMC has started developing a 2 nanometer processor. That's just one more nanometer than one nanometer process! Marking a significant leap from the already tiny 5 nanometer process, the same company is expected to start producing en masse sometime this year. Unsurprisingly, we don't have a ton of details other than: we're working on it! but the sheer size of the 2 nanometer process is news in it of itself because the transistors will only be about 10 atoms wide, which will surely start making even the current 7 nanometer process feel a little self-conscious when it looks in the mirror. Fouh! Puttin' on a... [in background] I could stand to lose a few atoms! Now, it's time for the kickflips brought to you by... [kickflip] [in background] Woah! Private Internet Accessit's like a kickflip movie, you know, which lets you mask your IP, and encrypt your traffic. PIA offers over 33 hundred (3300) servers in 30 countries with no bandwidth caps. It has configurable encryption levels and a kill switch to keep you in control, and when combined with private browsing best practices, it can make websites think that you are in a different country. Pah! Siwwy [silly] websites! You can connect up to five devices at once with a single account, whether they're Windows, Mac, Android, iOS or Linux, and PIA's MACE feature blocks malware and tracking domains. Try it out at the link below with a 30 day money back guarantee. On to the kickflips! [kickflip] [in background] Woah! [in background] Tony Hawk would be proud. You can now get your hands on a new set of Pixel Buds for $179 from the Google store. The new ear buds have been completely redesigned from the somewhat disappointing first generation, and they come with a dedicated app, though I'm really not sure about the color naming scheme because \"Oh So Orange\" and \"Quite Mint\" sound like pieces that belong in a bowl of Trix. [in background] What kind of Trix have you had? If you're interested in getting the new iPhone SE to replace your aging iPhone 8, then there is some good news, as an iFixit teardown has revealed that you can actually use parts from the iPhone 8 in the new SE, if something goes awry including the display assembly, sim holder, taptic engine, and cameraswait... did Apple just make a repairable product unintentionally? Wha [in background] Wha? Ththe room is spinning around mewait no, I'm the one who's spinning. Everything's fine. [in background] Yeah, just stop. NVIDIA has finished acquiring Mellanox, a large provider of networking products for data centers. The acquisition cost around 7 billion dollars, and is part of invidious growing ambitions in artificial intelligence. Their tech is in the majority, now, of the world's 500 most powerful supercomputers, so, maybe through all of this, we will somehow be able to run Cyberpunk 2077 at 4k. And, if you can't wait for the sequel to The Last of Us, lots of footage has been leaked recently, giving users early glimpses at gameplay, and the user interface, and alsoWoo!, some cutscenes that reveal some important plot details. [in background] Nnng! Although the game is officially delayed indefinitely, Sony is reportedly quite hard at work, trying to get it ready for distribution. This just in, there is apparently a release date now. whatwwellwhen is it David? [morse code & news theme in background] June 14th! Enjoy! Fun! Zombies! [in background] Get a PS4! Back to TechLinked! And, yes. It is a little ironic that a game about zombies is being pushed back by a real pandemic, isn't it? [in background] Oh. I was wondering Finally, Disney has announced that Star Wars Episode 9 will be available to stream on Disney Plus starting on the 4th of May, or Star Wars dayare you just messing with me? Who cares? [in background] I didn'tI didI didn't even put this in! It's a bad movie. It's a bad movie, and no one should watch it [laughter in background] [in background] Wait, read itread it. This is a couple of months ahead of schedule, but it's unsurprising given that Disney probably wants to capitalize on everyone staying at home for the time being because obviously that means they can't go to the theater and see a better movie. Come back on Wednesday for more tech news. Oh, did you have a joke in there? [in background] Yeah, you gotta read the last line. Something, something, corpse! Riley really wants me to say \"so if you'd like to see the corpse of a once great franchise paraded about in a psychotic mockery of itself, go check it out on Disney Plus. It sucks! Well, that's it, that's our show, I'm out. So, come back Wednesday for more tech news that hopefully ends on a better noteOh! kickflip! Woah! He's got no skateboard! How's he doing this? It turns out we did end on a cool note!",

    "transcript": "- What? You've never seen \"Space Jam?\" The Monstars. (bouncy music) Yo guys, Jonathan here, this is the Iphone 10, this is face unlock working, but today, I am going to see if I can trick it, and thank goodness, because it is Halloween, I have an assortment of costumes and masks, and fake mustaches. - Mornin'. - Good day to you, sir. Wait a minute, what the hell? - But first, I am going to use the Ipad, I got a little video. But I want to see if that will work on Face ID. Can I trick it with the video? I'm going to lock it, see if I can get you guys to play that again, nothing seems to be working. No. (beep) From there, I think it's time to move on to a mask, this is actually Robin. Not Batman, how do I look? Nope, I got denied, shut down, I got that little lock saying, \"nope, you are not getting on my phone, sorry Robin.\" (beep) No, to kind of clear this out as we move on through each mask and different disguise, I'm going to unlock it, so we can start from a fresh slate, because if someone tries to get into your phone, it's gonna make you enter the password the next time, from there, we got a clown nose. From what I understand, the three main components of Face ID are your eyes, your nose and your mouth, so I'm going to assume that this will not work. Denied. One more time, denied. (beep) And I'm going to assume, because that Robin mask did not work that this is also not gonna work. Whoa, my hair. From there, denied. (beep) If I peek it. Will it work? That works, so, I'm going to see if I can actually register Captain America. Okay, I can move my head. That's step one, okay that's complete, I might be able to oh, this is ridiculous. Second Face ID scan complete, Face ID is now set up, so here we go, we're going to try this out. It unlocks! (ding) So the problem with this now is my normal face does not work, ah damn it! Put the mask back on. Unlocked, okay. Man, I did not need to stretch my neck out like I did in that unboxing, it's way simpler than I made it out to be. Face ID is back with me, so from there, I think we'll go a little simpler, with some glasses. That unlocks it, so glasses were not a problem. (ding) From what I understand, tinted glasses or sunglasses should work as well, but this is no problem here whatsoever. Swipe up, I'm in the phone, so that did not seem to affect things. So far the only thing we're able to get in with this Iphone 10, is programming Captain America's face, and glasses on myself, but so far everything else has been denied. Got that old man mustache, and eyebrows. I guess we'll start with the mustache, and oh man, got hair everywhere. Ah! Nope, (laughs) Psst! Nope, denied. (beep) Rip it off, it works. So I understand that if you grow a beard gradually over time, or a mustache, that's it's gonna kind of adjust with you, but if you go drastic, like I did in this case, it is not gonna work, so yeah, that is shutting me down. Pfll! There you go. Iphone 10. That unlocked. (ding) In my phone, eyebrows do not affect it apparently, so, yep, that worked twice, so mustache, no, old man eyebrows, yes. Next, we got the Snazzy Q stache going on here. Did you guys know Snazzy also modeled part time for Halloween costumes too? He's a beautiful man. A beautiful man from Utah. Okay, no (laughs) Why do these things... Damn it. (beep) Oh, this is the backside, right? Those are eyes, no? Nope, that's just the emoji. Oh no. Denied, why is that denied? Is it my hair? Let me try entering the password. Fris-tal... Nope. (beep) That unlocks. Oh man, next... We got the wig. Okay. I'm sorry, I really am, I'm sorry, I'm terribly sorry. This is not letting me in. What do you want me to do? I guess I should try to program it, isn't that right? It worked. (ding) So crazy, yeah, that let me in, it's not, why didn't that work with the poop emoji face, and it's working with this. Okay, Rich, choose your favorite Ninja Turtle. (muffled voice) You don't know any Ninja Turtles! Everybody, for shame. - Don't look at me, don't look at me. - [Jonathan] For shame! No, Rich. I'm going with my favorite, oh man, am I screwing things up? Ninja Turtles do not work. (beep) It is that mask, so that is probably covering up too much of my eyes, so, yeah, it's been a really interesting test, I'm not sure how much it helped you out. I had this beard. So Game of Thrones. Denied. (beep) Ow... Here you go, Rich, grow some facial hair. It's not gonna work, but I assume I can program the face. Face, nope, that's not gonna work. Clearly that is not gonna work. Let's do this one. Oh dear god. Ah, now I'm like so determined to get this. It is done, I think we got this. It unlocked! (ding) Thank you guys very much for watching this video. Hopefully enjoyed it, if you did, and found a little amusement out of that, make sure you guys drop a like down below. If you want to see a more comprehensive video on my unboxing with the Iphone 10 that is way more informative, I will catch you guys later. Bye. Nope, needs that beard. - Okay, I'm gonna cut. - Cool.",

    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going Dave2D here, and this is the 34UC89G from LG It's their new Widescreen gaming display, and it's awesome I got to thank LG for sending this thing out for me to check out and for sponsoring this video because they're actually running a contest for you guys to win one you can win one of these displays or the Grand Prize is a $10,000 gaming setup. It's pretty crazy. I'll link all that stuff below but first let's check out This display 34 inches IPs panel with good color Gamut And it's slightly curved so you can get that visual wraparound when you're playing games But most importantly this thing runs at 144 Hertz and has NVIDIA G-SYNC the resolution is 2560 by 1080 It's not particularly high-res But if your main goal is to play games well this resolution is perfect you can get high resolution screens obviously But unless you have insanely good hardware You're going to get a better viewing experience and gaming experience on this thing where you don't ever have to scale 1440p and 4K gaming sounds great But when you're actually playing running around trying to kill players before they kill you High resolution doesn't matter very much the big thing is frame rate the difference from being able to see 144 Hertz versus a regular 60 Hertz panel is massive so if you have good hardware And you can get good frame rates in games this display is awesome for it, and if you're running a high-end laptop But it has a 60 hertz screen docking it to this thing is really nice it also has NVIDIA G-SYNC So if you have an NVIDIA card it will minimize any kind of visual Artifacts or tearing that you would see in games stuff Just looks super buttery smooth on this thing now higher refresh rates are amazing But it's not something you can experience from watching a video because my videos are being displayed in 24 frames per second But if you can see these higher frame rates in person it looks really nice, and you'll notice the difference right away I also want to talk about the widescreen element so the fact that it's a 21 by 9 aspect ratio for Some games the widescreen thing just makes the game look lot better and the curvature gives a very immersive experience for those games It's a visual treat right. It's nice to have something wide but it doesn't give you a competitive advantage Just because you have a wider screen But there are games like rainbow six siege where having a wide screen like this does give you an actual advantage A very perceptible advantage when you're in game with the same Fov You're actually seeing more and I've noticed that most pro rainbows players are using wide screens because of that advantage You're literally seeing more than players that aren't using wide screen displays Their hardware on this thing is nice. It seems really well built. The ports on the back are easy to access You don't have to look from underneath or anything and the menu is also super intuitive you get a bunch of game modes to choose from you can overclock the refresh rates to 166Hz instead of the stock 144 And there's even a crosshair menu to put some sights into games that don't have sights And I don't know how I feel about that because that's a pretty distinct advantage for people that have this monitor but that's what makes it an awesome gaming monitor ok LG 34UC89G starts at $1000 and if you're interested in winning one for yourself LG is running a contest. It's the 2017 Ultra Wide festival called the dream Quest and I've linked all the details down in the description below Basically you make a short video clip 144 seconds or less and you talk about why you want to win the display and the prizes for the class get better and better? Until the last quest has an amazing grand prize of a $10,000 gaming setup It's going to be nuts and if you don't want to submit a video entry you can also win these displays by Participating in like the voting and stuff like that I'll link again full details in the description Ok hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it. See you guys next time",

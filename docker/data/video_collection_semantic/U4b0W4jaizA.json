    "transcript": "Alright, today we got something unusual.. It's called 'The Odin Worlds First Projection Mouse'. I don't have a problem with my mouse or trackpad or anything like that. But sometimes I'm just looking around and I'm like there some new tech right there maybe it's interesting I'm not really sure, I gotta check it out. I gotta find out more importantly if it's any good or if it's sucks. So the world first projection mouse. Let's find out together. It's from a company I haven't heard of called 'Sarafim'. My first time using one. Your first time seeing one. It kinda looks like a transformer as well. It's good thing I think. Maybe advantages as a small- uuh... It is very small actually look at that thing. That's the mouse, definitely transformer like. Some red cut out on the front and then on the back is where the Micro USB Port is. So this end here, just gonna plug right in over here and supposedly what happens is this little guy sits in front of you wherever you want your trackpad to be and then projects it on to the desk. So let's go ahead and grab this laptop here. Uh wow! That do booted up right away! Okay so, I have it plugged in now. I don't know I mean.... OOOWW! Alright it's actually not... bad. uuuuh aaaah I don't know guys. Ugh! It's mostly it's a precision thing like it works but... I like how it makes a little clicking like the dude winks when you click down. I mean it's usable. It's hard to really compare it to a real trackpad. In what kind of scenario would you need something like this as opposed to a traditional mouse. I don't really know. And also the surface you projecting onto is gonna make an impact to a certain extent because if it's a slick surface you probably slide a little bit better than if it's a rough one. It just doesn't really have a precision for me ugaaah! It's kind of frustrating to be honest. Now maybe if you went up here kinda adjusted the sensitivity you could maybe dial it a little bit better. I don't if it's slower would it be? Yeah, I mean. It works it's not as good as an actual trackpad. I mean it would have to be quite good for to be cool in my opinion. It would have to be such a substantial improvement that you would like to use it over whatever you have built-in. Or over a standard mouse that cost a couple dollars. Is it cool? Yeah, of course. Look at that I mean he's got a red laser. I mean it's look incredibly cool you would want to try that I'm sure. But... aa I don't wanna really shut the guy's down too much after all they claimed it the worlds first is kind of interesting. I like new technology. Plus it look's like a transformer so, it's got to be points for that. It's claiming to be a mouse. It's claiming to displace this product that everybody super familiar with you have one on your desk or maybe you have trackpad. You're very familiar. He claims he that it's gonna displace that is calling itself a mouse yet it doesn't do that job better the other stuff that's already out there, so. And I mean I saw this in Amazon. I was skeptical but of course the only way to truly know is to order it and test it yourself The thing is cool, right. I mean it's look like a transformer got to get cool points for that alone. But the question you want answer is does it suck? It probably does. If you bought this thing, you would probably be disappointed you probably would hope that it would perform as well but with the new tech. You let me know in the comment. My evaluation. It' ain't that good. I'm na say it probably sucks. You tell me that's what the comments are for. Merry Christmas! Oh yeah right!

    "transcript": "(SPEAKER_00) When Mark Zuckerberg told us, (SPEAKER_00) \"The future is living in a one-bedroom apartment,\" (SPEAKER_00) \"experiencing the world through my plastic VR accessory,\" (SPEAKER_00) understandably, we mocked him. (SPEAKER_00) But then... (SPEAKER_00) When Tim Apple did it, we were excited beyond all reason. (SPEAKER_00) Why? (SPEAKER_00) What is it about the Vision Pro (SPEAKER_00) that caused this sudden shift? (SPEAKER_00) And can the world of spatial computing (SPEAKER_00) be accessed by us PC folk? (SPEAKER_00) It turns out the answer is yes. (SPEAKER_00) So let's talk about why the Vision Pro (SPEAKER_00) is the most exciting piece of technology (SPEAKER_00) that I've used in years, (SPEAKER_00) and why I can't wait to pack it up and put it away. (SPEAKER_00) Odoo, their all-in-one software will let you focus on running and improving your business (SPEAKER_00) rather than playing hot potato with a bunch of mismatching apps. (SPEAKER_00) Click the link below or watch till the end of this video to learn more. (SPEAKER_00) First contact with the Vision Pro is something you won't soon forget. (SPEAKER_00) The material choices and the build quality are exceptional to the point where I would (SPEAKER_00) say they are the best we have ever seen on a VR headset. From the aluminum frame, (SPEAKER_00) to the curved glass front, to the fabric headband, it is on a whole different level, (SPEAKER_00) which should result in a very comfortable headset. But there is one small problem. (SPEAKER_00) These hinges do not rotate. (SPEAKER_00) The hinge where it attaches is no hinge at all. (SPEAKER_00) It doesn't swivel, which from my experience means (SPEAKER_00) choosing between either extra pressure on your forehead (SPEAKER_00) or wearing it higher and having extra pressure (SPEAKER_00) on your cheekbones, and in my case, (SPEAKER_00) particularly the bridge of my nose. (SPEAKER_00) Now, Apple acknowledges this (SPEAKER_00) with the inclusion of their dual loop band, (SPEAKER_00) but this has the exact same problem of inflexibility, (SPEAKER_00) meaning that, say for example, (SPEAKER_00) you like to wear a back ponytail, (SPEAKER_00) you better learn to wear a top one or a low one, (SPEAKER_00) and it makes mounting the device more annoying (SPEAKER_00) and still resulted in subpar comfort for me. (SPEAKER_00) The good news is that it's easy to forget, (SPEAKER_00) at least for a while, the second the screen turns on. (SPEAKER_00) Believe (SPEAKER_00) every single word you heard (SPEAKER_00) from the Apple evangelists in your life, (SPEAKER_00) because holy balls, does this thing ever look incredible. (SPEAKER_00) At just under 4K per eye, (SPEAKER_00) with nearly three times the pixel count of the MetaQuest 3, (SPEAKER_00) not to mention no discernible screen door effect whatsoever, (SPEAKER_00) it is unlike anything that I have ever experienced. (SPEAKER_00) The 12 cameras on the front and bottom of the device (SPEAKER_00) create a three-dimensional live view (SPEAKER_00) of the world around you that, again, (SPEAKER_00) crushes Mr. Zuckerberg's best efforts. (SPEAKER_00) And this is all thanks to Apple's latest homegrown silicon, (SPEAKER_00) the R1, which handles the video stitching and pass-through, (SPEAKER_00) as well as eye tracking, hand tracking, and head movements (SPEAKER_00) in a way that I just didn't think would be possible (SPEAKER_00) for quite a long time. (SPEAKER_00) Now, one thing to be careful of (SPEAKER_00) is getting fingerprints on the cameras, (SPEAKER_00) as it's very easy to do accidentally (SPEAKER_00) while putting the headset on, (SPEAKER_00) and it will make things look a little fuzzy. (SPEAKER_00) When it's working its best, though, (SPEAKER_00) my goodness, is it ever incredible. (SPEAKER_00) You look around, you resize, (SPEAKER_00) you reposition objects in virtual space, (SPEAKER_00) and it's shockingly smooth and natural. (SPEAKER_00) As long as you don't wanna do something Apple says (SPEAKER_00) you're not allowed to do, like, oh, I don't know, (SPEAKER_00) zoom something in more than you're allowed to. (SPEAKER_00) Another Apple thing is that they tend to be selective (SPEAKER_00) about publishing their specs, and they opted not to publish a field of view number for this headset. (SPEAKER_00) Now that could be because it varies (SPEAKER_00) depending on your exact face shape and how you wear it. (SPEAKER_00) The thicker cushion, for example, (SPEAKER_00) will shrink it a little bit, (SPEAKER_00) but the more likely reason is that it kind of sucks. (SPEAKER_00) Let's find out using what Alex calls, oh, thank you, (SPEAKER_00) the FOV Finder 5000. (SPEAKER_00) For context, (SPEAKER_00) the valve index is around 110 degrees, and the leading headset from Pimax is about 160, (SPEAKER_00) with the original Oculus Rift being 88. I am going to go ahead and move this until I can (SPEAKER_00) no longer see the edges, which occurs... (SPEAKER_01) That's 79 degrees. (SPEAKER_00) Oh. (SPEAKER_00) Well, that's not very good, is it? (SPEAKER_01) That test actually wasn't 100% accurate (SPEAKER_01) because we measured the FOV of the cameras, (SPEAKER_01) not Linus's actual FOV, (SPEAKER_01) which would be a little bit larger (SPEAKER_01) because Apple is distorting stuff. (SPEAKER_01) So look, if I put this on right here (SPEAKER_01) and look at this grid on the wall, (SPEAKER_01) when I look at it straight on, (SPEAKER_01) everything seems to be pretty straight in the middle (SPEAKER_01) and then on the sides, it'll be curved. (SPEAKER_01) But if I look at the corner, (SPEAKER_01) it is actively compensating for those distortions in my eyes. (SPEAKER_01) What's even more surprising is that if I go in here, take off the light guard, and put it on like this, (SPEAKER_01) my expectation was that the camera's FOV would stay the same, but it actually gets much larger, so before I could only see about the edges of this, (SPEAKER_01) now I can see all the way out to here, which is why you can get between like 90 up all the way to 110 on this, (SPEAKER_01) and it's using the eye tracking to actively compensate for those differences. (SPEAKER_00) Of course, Apple has made it abundantly clear that the Vision Pro is not a VR headset, it is a spatial computing device for professional work, (SPEAKER_00) it's meant for serious things, so naturally, the first thing we wanted to do was game on it, because on paper, it should be very good. (SPEAKER_00) $7 for an Apple Arcade subscription later, and... (SPEAKER_00) We're in. (SPEAKER_00) The headliner game for the Apple Vision Pro (SPEAKER_00) appears to be Super Fruit Ninja, (SPEAKER_00) and I can't think of a better game (SPEAKER_00) to illustrate both its incredible strengths (SPEAKER_00) and its complete and utter failings. (SPEAKER_00) So let's go ahead and fire it up. (SPEAKER_00) Look at this, you guys. (SPEAKER_00) Everything around me, (SPEAKER_00) in spite of the high resolution of these displays, (SPEAKER_00) is rendered in crystal clear image quality (SPEAKER_00) with no discernible frame rate drops. (SPEAKER_00) It is. (SPEAKER_00) Far and away the best that I have ever seen on a headset. (SPEAKER_00) And that is thanks to the same M2 chip (SPEAKER_00) as the current MacBooks. (SPEAKER_00) And this too, Apple's environmental mapping (SPEAKER_00) and the solidity of the placement of virtual objects (SPEAKER_00) in the real world makes everything else I've ever seen (SPEAKER_00) look like a cheap toy in comparison. (SPEAKER_00) Unfortunately, the whole thing falls apart (SPEAKER_00) the second you try to interact with the game. (SPEAKER_00) Hey, remember when I said no frame rate drops? (SPEAKER_00) In a traditional inside-out headset like the Quest 3 or the PSVR 2, not only are there cameras (SPEAKER_00) tracking where your hands are, there are gyros, thank you, and accelerometers inside the controllers (SPEAKER_00) that will handle quick movements, fine movements, or fill in the gaps during any times when your (SPEAKER_00) hands are not visible or the cameras temporarily lose tracking for some reason. Without that (SPEAKER_00) accelerometer input, the Vision Pro simply doesn't have the tracking fidelity for a game like Fruit (SPEAKER_00) Ninja, with every single loss that I experienced on the device feeling like... (SPEAKER_00) The Apple Vision Pro was to blame, not my skills. (SPEAKER_00) Hey, hey, hey, hey! (SPEAKER_00) And honestly, playing anything but the slowest pace (SPEAKER_00) of iPad apps made me feel pretty much the same way. (SPEAKER_00) I just immediately wanted my stupid slab of glass back. (SPEAKER_00) Of course, we went into this knowing (SPEAKER_00) the Vision Pro isn't a VR gaming headset. (SPEAKER_00) So why don't we move on to one of its greatest strengths? (SPEAKER_00) Putting an enormous (SPEAKER_00) high fidelity display anywhere you want, (SPEAKER_00) and then using that to play real games. (SPEAKER_00) Now, I went into this assuming (SPEAKER_00) that getting Windows working on this headset (SPEAKER_00) would be a chore and a half, or at least 1.3 chores. (SPEAKER_00) I mean, Apple doesn't even let you buy the Vision Pro (SPEAKER_00) if you don't already have a reasonably current iPhone. (SPEAKER_00) But as it turns out, the process is incredibly simple. (SPEAKER_00) If you only wanna play games, (SPEAKER_00) all you've gotta do is download the Steam Link iPad app (SPEAKER_00) from the App Store, (SPEAKER_00) choose what computer you wanna stream from, (SPEAKER_00) and it figures out the rest. (SPEAKER_00) Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! (SPEAKER_00) I mean, is that something or what? (SPEAKER_00) What kind of absolute mad lad would have a TV this big? (SPEAKER_00) Wee! (SPEAKER_00) It's a little laggy. (SPEAKER_00) Would I find it easier to play just looking (SPEAKER_00) at the laptop screen with the 12 milliseconds (SPEAKER_00) or so of pass-through? (SPEAKER_00) Dude, with all the just like compression blocking (SPEAKER_00) and everything and the fact that this is only at 1080p, (SPEAKER_00) the experience like this is pretty similar. (SPEAKER_00) Wee! (SPEAKER_00) Of course a key difference is that I can't put that display anywhere that I want and (SPEAKER_00) As much as I might complain about the latency. It's good enough for most gamers in (SPEAKER_00) Most games for example in Forza assuming you're a halfway decent driver (SPEAKER_00) You'll probably find that frame pacing is more important than a little bit of lag here or there (SPEAKER_00) But if you were to play other games competitive games even driving ones like say Rocket League (SPEAKER_00) The latency is too high to for example (SPEAKER_00) Counter a last-second fake out from your opponent. Steam link also has some big limitations (SPEAKER_00) regardless of which headset you're using the highest resolution that you can stream is 1080p and (SPEAKER_00) you can only play games but that my friends is where Sunshine and Moonlight come in (SPEAKER_00) and no I'm not telling you to go outside sunshine available on the Lizard Bite github (SPEAKER_00) page allows you to easily convert your pc or laptop into a streaming server then the Moonlight (SPEAKER_00) iPad app on your vision pro will give you full access to your windows machine at up to 4K 120 (SPEAKER_00) frames per second though it should be noted you're going to need one (SPEAKER_00) heck of a wireless access point in order to hit that consistently 4K here we go I'm not even going (SPEAKER_00) to try 120 right now our Wi-Fi in this part of the office is uh not great. The spatiality of the audio (SPEAKER_00) is incredible. Like that TV's behind me now, no question. Unfortunately with our Wi-Fi on the (SPEAKER_00) sets not being as good as we'd like Sunshine and Moonlight didn't perform that great in gaming (SPEAKER_00) but the big killer app is not really games it's the ability to just use a Windows PC (SPEAKER_00) with a virtual desktop in the vision pro and for that it works freaking great. (SPEAKER_00) Like look at this. Honestly Alex I gotta say the latency feels very very similar (SPEAKER_00) to the native connection to the Macbook. (SPEAKER_01) Try it. (SPEAKER_00) This is going to be the thing that finally breaks Apple and makes (SPEAKER_00) them integrate touch into Mac OS the fact that people are going to be sitting there in their (SPEAKER_00) Vision Pro and just want to click on things and then they're going to introduce it and everyone's (SPEAKER_00) going to be like wow it's so obvious sometimes it's nice to be able to tap on things and then (SPEAKER_00) they're going to put touch screens on Macs, this is it mark my words. And if it doesn't happen then it (SPEAKER_00) is only because of Apple's complete and utter stubbornness there's no other reason. (SPEAKER_00) Wow it is struggling a lot more in this environment but over at the Lab I did not have the same problem (SPEAKER_00) it was a little laggy, it was fine. Yeah once again I've got serious latency issues which underscores (SPEAKER_00) that you are going to need a really nice modern access point for the best possible experience on this. (SPEAKER_00) I'll show you a little bit of contrasting footage here to give you some idea of what this is supposed to look like, (SPEAKER_00) Yeah. Unfortunately, that's not the kind we have here on the set so using Windows on a big old virtual spatial display? (SPEAKER_00) Incredible. The latency is very similar to using it on the MacBook, which means (SPEAKER_00) there is some, regardless of your access point, (SPEAKER_00) but it's very, very usable (SPEAKER_00) and worth the trade-off of the giant display. (SPEAKER_00) The only thing that I'd say is different (SPEAKER_00) is that it doesn't have that really cool (SPEAKER_00) augmented reality connect thing (SPEAKER_00) that is such a mwah, it just works moment. (SPEAKER_00) Now, if you do have some weirdness, (SPEAKER_00) part of that comes down to the way (SPEAKER_00) that Apple made their wireless chip set (SPEAKER_00) and apparently setting your router to use channel 149 (SPEAKER_00) can help solve it. (SPEAKER_00) Bottom line, (SPEAKER_00) incredible for non-competitive games. With a powerful GPU in the streaming system, (SPEAKER_00) I'd say this is pretty much the definitive way to experience Baldur's Gate 3 or something from the Witcher series. (SPEAKER_00) But if you're a competitive gamer, you could get nearly the same field of view while having much lower latency for a lot less money. (SPEAKER_00) So, gaming perspective aside then, let's take a look at the Vision Pro more in the ways that Apple intended, which is where the device starts to get in some ways cooler, but in other ways (SPEAKER_00) a bit more complicated. I've already stated that this is the best video pass- through that I've (SPEAKER_00) encountered by a metric mile, but pass-through has never been a core function of a headset to quite (SPEAKER_00) the same degree before. On a PSVR or most PC headsets, it's a convenience feature so you can (SPEAKER_00) find your water bottle in between rounds, but on the Vision Pro, the expectation is that you're (SPEAKER_00) doing work. (SPEAKER_00) Probably in an office with other humans while in pass-through mode for extended periods of time, which... (SPEAKER_00) can get rather strange because it literally warps your perception of reality. (SPEAKER_00) Oh yeah, that's really disorientating. (SPEAKER_00) They won't be seeing it in 3D, so they won't realize how this tree, like... (SPEAKER_00) You see, the camera distorts your perception of objects, (SPEAKER_00) particularly ones that are too close, and (SPEAKER_00) while the pass-through is shockingly low latency, allowing you to easily dodge a thrown object, (SPEAKER_00) Oh! (SPEAKER_00) The perception of depth of really everything around you (SPEAKER_00) is going to be a bit off. (SPEAKER_00) The good news is that your brain (SPEAKER_00) is really good at compensating for this. (SPEAKER_00) So when you hear people say, (SPEAKER_00) \"Yeah, the first 30 minutes was kind of weird, (SPEAKER_00) but then it just clicked.\" (SPEAKER_00) You can expect to have a pretty similar experience. (SPEAKER_00) The weird one though, (SPEAKER_00) is that your brain also clicks the other way. (SPEAKER_00) So when you take the headset off, (SPEAKER_00) it's typical to have a minute or two of, (SPEAKER_00) \"Whoa, hold on a second,\" (SPEAKER_00) before things click back into place. (SPEAKER_00) Speaking of things clicking into place, (SPEAKER_00) a big pet peeve of mine with this product (SPEAKER_00) is the complete inability to grab something (SPEAKER_00) in the virtual world and pin it in your peripheral vision (SPEAKER_00) while you go about the rest of your life. (SPEAKER_00) In fairness to Apple, (SPEAKER_00) the accuracy of the way that it (SPEAKER_00) takes an object and keeps it exactly where you left it (SPEAKER_00) is incredible. (SPEAKER_00) It's just that I don't always want to have to (SPEAKER_00) carry things around with me (SPEAKER_00) when I want to refer back to them, like this script. (SPEAKER_00) Another thing that bummed me out (SPEAKER_00) anytime I spent an extended period and pass through (SPEAKER_00) was the video fidelity. (SPEAKER_00) And look, I don't want to take anything away (SPEAKER_00) from what Apple has achieved here, (SPEAKER_00) but I could never forget that I was looking (SPEAKER_00) at a video feed of the world through phone cameras. (SPEAKER_00) Compounding this issue is the fact that virtual content (SPEAKER_00) rendered by the Vision Pro is so high fidelity (SPEAKER_00) and so vibrant that the real world ends up looking (SPEAKER_00) drab and dull by comparison. (SPEAKER_00) Here, I can demonstrate this. (SPEAKER_00) That right there is a color checker classic (SPEAKER_00) on what is a, by all accounts, (SPEAKER_00) beautiful and color accurate screen. (SPEAKER_00) This is a color checker classic in the real world. (SPEAKER_00) See the difference? (SPEAKER_00) Another major issue is motion blur. (SPEAKER_00) While the pixel response times of this micro OLED display (SPEAKER_00) allow objects to look extremely crisp even when in motion, (SPEAKER_00) as you move your head, (SPEAKER_00) it's normal for the whole world to end up looking (SPEAKER_00) and feeling a little bit jello-y. (SPEAKER_00) Also, Apple is regularly forced to use weird shutter angles (SPEAKER_00) in order to compensate (SPEAKER_00) for the flickering of lights around you, (SPEAKER_00) which can in some cases cause them to have to crank the ISO, (SPEAKER_00) adding a bunch of noise to the image. (SPEAKER_00) Even in well-lit rooms. (SPEAKER_00) While we spent a lot of time so far talking about things (SPEAKER_00) you can do with the Vision Pro, (SPEAKER_00) I actually spent most of my time with the device (SPEAKER_00) doing what you are supposed to do, (SPEAKER_00) which is professional work in my own virtual space. (SPEAKER_00) And it can be really sweet. (SPEAKER_00) I love being able to take private notes in a meeting (SPEAKER_00) or work on sensitive material in a group setting. (SPEAKER_00) But the problem is that (SPEAKER_00) it cuts both ways. (SPEAKER_00) One of the first things that I wanted to do (SPEAKER_00) was share a document with someone and mark it up together. (SPEAKER_00) And yeah. Because there's no obvious way to mirror (SPEAKER_00) my MacBook's display, I had to use a bizarre workaround (SPEAKER_00) that involved screen sharing from inside the Vision Pro (SPEAKER_00) to a video conference with someone who was sitting there (SPEAKER_00) on a laptop next to me in the same room. (SPEAKER_00) Also, even if all you want to do is work privately, (SPEAKER_00) the whole setup can be a bit of a chore. (SPEAKER_00) I mean, the Vision Pro sounds like having your own personal Colin (SPEAKER_00) holding a TV for you and then allowing it to be repositioned (SPEAKER_00) and float effortlessly wherever you want. (SPEAKER_00) But in practice... (SPEAKER_00) I just don't really often need to do that. And neither do a lot of people. For example, Nicole. (SPEAKER_00) Here's a real person doing real work. For a fraction of the cost of a Vision Pro, (SPEAKER_00) she has multiple 4K displays all within her field of view at once. And this (SPEAKER_00) is how much she has to move her head in order to look between them. Wow. (SPEAKER_00) Again, I appreciate this thing for the technological marvel that it is. (SPEAKER_00) A 4K display in a single square inch? (SPEAKER_00) But for optimal text clarity, you need to use most of those pixels, (SPEAKER_00) meaning that the virtual monitor needs to be absolutely massive for the Vision Pro to really shine, (SPEAKER_00) making your workspace feel less like this and more like this. (SPEAKER_00) Obviously this demo is meant to be illustrative more than literal. For one thing, the Vision Pro (SPEAKER_00) does not currently support more than one MacBook display and we have five. Also, it's more like (SPEAKER_00) having a much larger TV that is quite a bit farther away. And that is a good thing in the (SPEAKER_00) sense that you'll be focusing more than a few feet in front of you. But I still found that in (SPEAKER_00) spite of that, eyestrain was a big problem for me if I spent more than an hour or so in spatial (SPEAKER_00) computing land. (SPEAKER_00) Making this productivity problem worse is the fact that at this time, the Vision Pro doesn't allow you to save your layouts. (SPEAKER_00) So every time you want to get back into it, you've got to put it on, (SPEAKER_00) authenticate, connect to your MacBook, resize that display, open a Safari window, put that over there where you want it, (SPEAKER_00) maybe your emails go over here. (SPEAKER_00) It's a lot of friction that our editors (SPEAKER_00) for example, don't go through every time they wanna sit down (SPEAKER_00) and get a couple hours of work done (SPEAKER_00) before their eyes and face hurt too much to continue. (SPEAKER_00) But none of that was my biggest disappointment. (SPEAKER_00) That actually came on day one. (SPEAKER_00) When I took home my Shiny Vision Pro, (SPEAKER_00) super excited to play with what is arguably (SPEAKER_00) the most revolutionary device to hit the market in years (SPEAKER_00) and quickly realized there's nothing to do. (SPEAKER_00) You can experience things, you can watch TV, look at 3D models, (SPEAKER_00) you can play iPad apps with kind of janky controls, but... (SPEAKER_00) I realized really quickly I wasn't having any fun. (SPEAKER_00) I know, app support is going to expand rapidly and in the near future there will almost certainly (SPEAKER_00) be some really cool stuff to do. (SPEAKER_00) But at the moment, what's available ranges from boring to outright dystopian. (SPEAKER_00) So what is it good for? (SPEAKER_00) If you don't need it for work, I'd say watching stuff in your own private movie theater is (SPEAKER_00) the killer app. (SPEAKER_00) You can really appreciate the higher streaming quality of extras at lmg.gg/floatplane and (SPEAKER_00) watching 3D movies in this thing is second to none. (SPEAKER_00) I think it's even safe to say that watching Encanto on the Vision Pro in 3D (SPEAKER_00) is the absolute best way to experience that movie. (SPEAKER_00) By myself. (SPEAKER_00) It's just that for the price of a Vision Pro, (SPEAKER_00) I could get a flagship LG C3, (SPEAKER_00) I could get a coffee table and a couch, (SPEAKER_00) and then I could experience it with my friends. (SPEAKER_00) I mean, sure, it might not be as immersive, (SPEAKER_00) but I know which one I'd rather have. (SPEAKER_00) I'll be back in a minute, guys. (SPEAKER_00) First, I just gotta finish up this review. (SPEAKER_00) Honestly, I felt the same way (SPEAKER_00) about spatial photos and videos. (SPEAKER_00) Reliving them? (SPEAKER_00) Absolutely amazing. (SPEAKER_00) And it feels like you're there again. (SPEAKER_00) So if you have a spatial capture capable iPhone, (SPEAKER_00) now is the time to start using that feature (SPEAKER_00) so that when a Vision Pro that's worth buying appears, (SPEAKER_00) you're gonna be ready to look back on those memories (SPEAKER_00) with a level of depth that is unmatched, even if it is a little janky still. (SPEAKER_00) So for all my criticisms, I don't hate the Vision Pro and I don't even think that it's bad. (SPEAKER_00) It's an incredible feat of engineering and it delivers on its promise of enabling new ways of interacting with each other and with the world around us. (SPEAKER_00) It's just not for me and not right now. (SPEAKER_00) I just can't think of a single thing (SPEAKER_00) that I would do with the Vision Pro (SPEAKER_00) that I wouldn't rather do on a device that I already own. (SPEAKER_00) And think about it. (SPEAKER_00) For $3,500, almost four grand (SPEAKER_00) with a decent amount of storage, (SPEAKER_00) I could read on my Kindle, work on my laptop, (SPEAKER_00) watch shows on my TV, and game on my PS5. (SPEAKER_00) And I can practically hear you guys saying, (SPEAKER_00) \"Well, yeah, everything that you just said (SPEAKER_00) is true of the smartphone as well. (SPEAKER_00) This is your Balmer moment, Linus. (SPEAKER_00) This is never gonna take off.\" (SPEAKER_00) But guys, I'm not saying it's not gonna take off. (SPEAKER_00) It will. (SPEAKER_00) It's just that there's a major hurdle (SPEAKER_00) that Apple needs to overcome. (SPEAKER_00) And that's convenience. (SPEAKER_00) My smartphone, guess what, (SPEAKER_00) is also a worse version of everything else (SPEAKER_00) that I already own. (SPEAKER_00) The difference is that it's already in my pocket. (SPEAKER_00) The Vision Pro, on the other hand, (SPEAKER_00) well, at least this version of it, (SPEAKER_00) with its unwieldy shape and giant battery bank, (SPEAKER_00) is very, very... (SPEAKER_00) not in my pocket. (SPEAKER_00) It's also not in this segue for our sponsor. (SPEAKER_00) Odoo. (SPEAKER_00) Imagine this, you're running a business, (SPEAKER_00) but it's being held together by a bunch (SPEAKER_00) of different software, kind of like electronic bandages. (SPEAKER_00) It's not ideal. (SPEAKER_00) And that's where Odoo (SPEAKER_00) and their business management suite comes in. (SPEAKER_00) They take the essential elements of any business (SPEAKER_00) and combine them into one unified operating system. (SPEAKER_00) Their CRM and sales apps make lead generation and closing deals easier than ever, (SPEAKER_00) while their point of sale and inventory apps make selling and product tracking a breeze. (SPEAKER_00) Also, their accounting app lets you auto create and send invoices, (SPEAKER_00) and it integrates with 28,000 banks from all over the world. (SPEAKER_00) But let's say you don't need absolutely all of that. (SPEAKER_00) Well, because Odoo is so highly customizable, (SPEAKER_00) you only have to choose the apps that your business will use. (SPEAKER_00) And if you find yourself just needing a single app, (SPEAKER_00) you can use it (SPEAKER_00) for free. With all that being said, the best part is that it's super easy with a user-friendly (SPEAKER_00) interface, AI-powered features, and a support team that'll have your back. So don't overwhelm (SPEAKER_00) your business with a bunch of software. Odoo!

(SPEAKER_00) Fun? Yeah, actually.",

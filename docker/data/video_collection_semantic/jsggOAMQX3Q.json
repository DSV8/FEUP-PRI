    "transcript": "- I'm not an artist. I can't paint, but I can type, and in 2023 if I wanna make a picture, that's all I have to do. Computer chips in the style of Salvador Dali. Oh, so Dali, just on a microchip, neat. Not exactly what I was expecting, but still cool. Well, that was easy. If only I knew if it was legal. (gentle music) Almost every piece of art you'll ever see was built on something else. Maybe it was made in a tradition, like expressionism or surrealism. Maybe it used a photograph for reference, or parodied another artist. Maybe it was created directly from other people's art, like a collage. Whatever it is, if it was made in much of the last century, in the U.S., that art is likely also protected by copyright. When the artist created it, they earned the exclusive temporary right to control who makes money from it. The Constitution offers these protections to promote the progress of science and useful arts. There's a paradox in this system. On one hand, letting people control and profit from their art helps encourage them to make more of it. On the other, culture is a common good. People can build on it in ways the original artist never intended, and the law includes exceptions to make that possible. So copyright law is a constant delicate balancing act, and when a new technology comes along, it can throw that balance into flux. Artificial intelligence is one of those technologies, and right now it's throwing a monkey wrench into just about every step of the copyright process. (gentle music) - So in October of 2022, someone actually tagged me, and they had made an AI-generated image using my name. I remember it being black and white, which almost all of my work is, and it kind of reminded me of a style I use for a series called Fangs. So I felt like I recognized the contours of my style in that image. - [Adi] This is Sarah Andersen, an illustrator, cartoonist, and one of the people on the vanguard of the fight over AI and copyright. In January, Andersen and two other artists, Karla Ortiz and Kelly McKernan, sued the AI image generator companies, MidJourney and Stability AI, for copyright infringement. - That incident kind of forced me to directly confront the issue, because I was then involved. - Their suit took aim at one of the central elements of generative AI, training its models. AI image text and audio generators, like Stable Diffusion, the system I was just using, are basically computer-generated sets of rules for creating works similar to a huge set of previous examples. Most AI companies are cagey about where they get their data, but for an image generator, the collection might look something like this. This is Laion-5B. It's a database composed of 5.85 billion web addresses for images scraped from across the internet, plus captions describing the images. Generative AI companies use or build databases like this one to train their systems, and many likely contain lots of copyrighted work. The evidence? Among other things, they can often reproduce famous photos or book snippets. Creators can also search for their work in datasets, thanks to sites like Have I Been Trained? And some have seen their names get used as prompts. For some of them, the experience felt violating. - If a generator is trained on your work, and then can imitate your style, someone could create images you don't approve of. They could create sexualized images, for example, and that can have real and unfortunate impacts on artists' careers, not to mention just the fact that people are going to, people already sell merchandise using artists' names and their work. And lastly, there's definitely a general malaise in the art world. I never saw this technology coming, and a lot of other artists didn't. And it has definitely dampened the spirit, although not killed it, certainly. - In other cases, they worried they were losing commissions to AI copies of their own work. That's raised the obvious question, is this legal? The answer is right now, nobody knows for sure. More on that in a second. First, here's a word from our sponsor. - More and more, we're seeing AI tools be integrated into our daily lives, from generating quick inspiring art, to capturing notes from important meetings. But with SAP Business AI, their tools are designed to deliver real-world results, helping your business become stronger, and helping you make decisions faster. This revolutionary AI technology allows you to be ready for anything that is thrown at you. Okay, that's it for me, but before we go, SAP doesn't influence the editorial of this video, but they do help make videos like this possible. - Okay, you're probably watching this on YouTube. You've probably heard the term fair use. It's a set of exceptions under which you can use copyrighted work, without paying or getting permission from the original creator. It's a tool for striking that balance between giving individual artists control of their work, and letting people build on common culture. AI companies, like Stability and OpenAI, call model training a classic case of fair use. The process takes something that was created for one purpose, like a picture designed to be admired in an art gallery, and uses it for the completely different purpose of analyzing art, or producing new work. And there is precedent for this argument. In the 2000s, for instance, an adult photography site, called Perfect 10, sued over Google image search, saying it was scooping up the subscriber-only pictures, and delivering thumbnail versions for free. Meanwhile, The Authors Guild filed its own suit over Google Books, which was scanning millions of books, and letting people search through short snippets online. Google was clearly using copyrighted work without permission, but courts found it provided significant, helpful new services that outweighed the potential financial damage to authors and photo sellers. It had the legal right to build on millions of copyrighted works. It's possible AI companies do too. That said, Google image search wasn't trying to replace adult photography sites. And Google Books wasn't trying to produce its own books. Generative AI is a new technology, and when copyright confronts a new technology, anything can happen. - One possible analogy would be the development of movies. In an old case involving the novel, \"Ben-Hur,\" and a movie version, the court said, yes, although movies didn't exist, and were hard to imagine when the book was written, nonetheless, the copyright includes control over this new space. With other technologies, we've been more skeptical. The courts at first said that player pianos didn't invade the copyright on music. And then Congress wrote a compromise into the Copyright Act, where you could make player piano rolls out of popular songs if you paid a royalty. And both of those are on the table for generative AI. - Even if a company could be generally in the clear for training an uncopyrighted work, a user could infringe copyright with a specific creation, like say, an almost exact imitation of a very famous photo, or a sequel to a bestselling book. Long story short, AI companies are arguing that they found an innovative new fair use of art. Some artists are pushing back, but a lot of these services users are wondering a very different question, did I make this? And if I wanna protect it with copyright law, can I? (gentle music) Computer scientist Stephen Thaler didn't start his work hoping to become a pioneer of AI copyright, but in 2018, he asked to register an image, titled, \"A Recent Entrance to Paradise.\" The creator? A system he called the Creativity Machine, part of a decades-long project to demonstrate computers can be sentient. - My case is that we have a machine, machine intelligence in fact, that is building up complex concepts totally on its own. - In a series of decisions on a recent lawsuit, courts and the U.S. Copyright Office have disagreed on very simple grounds. Their ultimatum? No human, no copyright, period. - The Copyright Office's current position is that an AI is not a human, and that only humans can be authors. So if you type a short prompt into an AI, there is no copyright on the resulting output, because it's not the result of human authorship. - The legal precedence underlying this are honestly weirder sounding than a debate over whether computers can make art. Have you ever wondered whether God could get a copyright? Well, the answer is no. Can you copyright the way a garden grows? Sorry. And a monkey that started playing with a camera, and took a selfie? His name was Naruto, and a hard fought battle determined that it wasn't his. Thaler is still fighting his case, and it's been hugely influential on the issue of AI copyright. But it's not directly addressing the question lots of people care about. The Creativity Machine doesn't work like a prompt-based AI image generator. It produces art pretty much autonomously, and Thaler's goal is to establish that it can earn a copyright with almost no human involvement whatsoever. For most people who are using systems, like Stable Diffusion, the question isn't whether that program can own an image. It's whether they can create an image through it, and own whatever comes out. This is Theatre D'opera Spatial, or Space Opera Theater. In 2022, a man named Jason Allen created it with the image generator MidJourney, and submitted it to an art show at the Colorado State Fair. He won, and in order to protect his claim to it, he applied to register the copyright. The Copyright Office saw news coverage of the story, and turned him down. It applied the same basic principle, no human, no copyright. The problem is Allen isn't a hands-on computer scientist. He's a MidJourney prompt engineering obsessive. Allen estimates he used about 600 prompt variations to get the output that he wanted. He sees MidJourney not as a program creating its own art, but as a tool similar to Photoshop. And while I feel safe guessing that The Creativity Machine isn't personally sad about being denied its copyright claim, Allen says not having his pretty famous work registered has created the same problems it would for any artist. Allen's not the only person in this boat. The Copyright Office has denied at least one other AI-generated work, a comic book created by Kristina Kashtanova, also using MidJourney. The office agreed Kashtanova could own the human written script, and even the way she arranged AI-generated images on a page, but not the images themselves. - I think their position is also completely unsustainable. And this cannot last more than a couple years. We are simply gonna have far too many people making far too much that's interesting and valuable just to say, \"This is a copyright blank space. There is no copyright in any of this.\" - And on top of all these concerns, there's a pragmatic problem. In all three cases I've mentioned, the Copyright Office rejected the works because they learned they were AI generated. But the lines between digital art and AI are blurring, as programs like Photoshop introduce AI elements. And if artists don't mention somewhere that they use AI, it might be hard for the office to detect its use. The debate over AI copyright is moving fast. What probably won't change is the stakes. Behind most art, there's a human who cares about its creation, who might depend on it to live. Ahead, there's a world of unexpected possibilities for adapting it to make something new. And somewhere in the middle, there's a few hundred years of lawyers and judges writing about monkeys, gods, and machines. And as for this? (gentle music) (laptop thudding) Nevermind. So what do you think about the balance between artists and AI creators? If you wanna learn more, go to theverge.com, or stay tuned to this channel. We'll have more coverage about AI soon.",

    "transcript": "- Yo, guys, Johnathon here, and if you're wondering why I look like this, it'll all make sense shortly. But essentially, the reason we're here is to check out the 240fps 1080p slow-mo on the iPhone 8, and to make it interesting, stack it side by side against this, the Red Epic-W, which is a $30,000 camera. And the reason I'm doing that is, surprisingly, 240fps 1080p is not a feature you will find on many phones or even cameras out there, I think, as of now, until the next GoPro comes out. Allegedly, I've also heard that the Pixel 2 is going to have 1080p 240 slow motion, but for now, it's like something where the Scarlet-W or the Raven is the cheapest option. It was like 14 or 15 grand just to get that feature. Obviously, two different sensors, different camera. I'm not gonna say this is magically gonna be better, but the fact that you have this in your pocket is kinda crazy, and let's test it out and see why am I fully colored. Rich, how do you feel about that? Can I take the Red in the water? - Absolutely not, never! No. - Why you yelling at me? - 'Cause this is crazy, John. - Yep, he gets it. He said, \"Anything for the shot.\" (upbeat electronic music) Now, the one thing just realized, I may not have had to get in the water the second time, because in order to get 240 frames per second on this camera, we have to switch it to 2K. That, in turn, crops it in crazy much. So to kind of get a similar framing, I'm actually, you know, right about here. I'm gonna roll. (upbeat electronic music) So, for reference, you saw how close I was with the iPhone 8. I was able to get pretty much right up in there, where with this, because of the crop factor, I have to stand all the way back here, which is kinda crazy. So, for test number two, I'm not sure if it's the greatest idea, but I'm gonna try and jump and clear that bench right there. Right now, I have the iPhone 8 set up, and then following that, once we get this done, I'll set up the Red in a similar configuration, so we can kind of match that framing. Let's try this out. (grunting) (buzzing) JK. Flagged for (censored) jumping! (grunting) That was a full clear, that was a full clear. Spiderman, what's up? Ready for it? Clean dismount. - [Male] Sean, if you're a skateboarder, this is a phone you need. - I'm not a skateboarder, but if you are, Tai Moss, you'd better upgrade. Do you know how to kick flip. - I don't. This is a new skateboard. It's like jacked because if I turn too much-- - But you normally could. - No, I still can't. Also, I can't turn right now. - Got it, okay. So, we're back on the Red, and again, because of that crop factor, you're about to see, I'm gonna have to move back quite a bit compared to the iPhone. Again, this is not super scientific, Danny Winget. We're kinda more or less just having fun here. Ah. Way back. Jump test number two. Hopefully I don't fall on my face this time. All right, I got this down. Two clearance, two clearance. Red down, one more. (grunting) So, at this point of the day, where it's getting darker, and because that crop is so intense, we are effectively letting in much less light to the sensor, so you can see it start to get grainier and noisier. Again, the point of the RED camera is not for 240fps slow motion. Especially when you have to crop that beautiful sensor this much. It's moreso an example of how that actually is a really cool feature to have on a smartphone, but I think that case is made, so from here on out, it's time to enjoy some iPhone 8 slow motion goodness. So, for the grand finale, we have a Photojojo colorblast kit. I'm not sure if I should go with pink or blue. Ralph has got yellow. I'm not even sure how this works. It feels like a bottle of mustard. (upbeat electronic music) - Hello, guys, my name is Ralph, and today you are watching Disney Channel. - You got me, man. - Was my audition good? - Now you're hired. - Sweet! Ah! You got my glasses dirty! (laughing) - So, thank you guys very much for watching. Hopefully you enjoyed this test. Again, it wasn't meant to be super scientific, but at least we had some fun. Right now, it's actually just about time to go take out the Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8 out of the water. I think, because magic, and somehow you're gonna see this video second, so if you missed that video, click right here. There's also a chance to win an iPhone 8, or a Galaxy S8 here. This is Johnathon, and I'll catch you guys later.",

    "transcript": "- Matt, I have a question. Have you heard of a magical place called Walmart. - Walmart? - Yeah, it's a place with always low prices. Such as, - Okay. Okay. - This first item. I took a trip to my local Walmart and bought a wide variety of technological inventions and marvels. - We've done videos like this in the past and I had to guess the price. Is that the case today? - Did I leave the price sticker on that? - Sure did. I'm gonna go on a limb and say this was 12.92. - Look, it's on clearance, okay? I got excited. - Did they get the new AirPods early? - Yes, that is exactly what this is. So what we're doing here is very simple. We're going to be bringing out a wide variety of Walmart house brand pieces of tech. So whether there'll be headphones or a whole box of goodies you got down here, Matt, outside of this one, you gotta guess how much they are and if they're actually worth it. 12.92 for a pair of fully wireless earbuds and take a look on the bottom. - They're USB-C. - It's 1/10th of price of AirPods, legitimately. Put them in your ears. - All right, let's see what we got here. - They're not pairing? - They're not showing up whatsoever. They do, it is charged. - Did you throw away the instructions? - This is America baby. (eagle squawks) We don't listen to no instructions. Hashtag stay toxic. - All right, let's let them charge. Let's continue on with our next item. - We should give these a fair shot. Do you ever have charging problems, Matt? What if I could tell you that there was a wireless charger available from our good friends at Walmart? It is a two in one wireless charging stand for both your Apple Watch and your phone of whatever kind of choosing you'd like because it uses the widely available Qi standard. - We don't need this. (glass shatters) - That didn't make it very far. (glass shatters) That still did not make it any... Well it's not staying there. - It's fine, look at that. (glass shatters) (lips sputter) We'll get rid of that one. (glass shatters) (cat yowls) Yeah, so what we do is we just kind of stick that in. Ugh, just, it feels gross. It like, it doesn't feel like it wants to go in. - But the thing is you put it in once and you never have to think about it again. - It's great that it's got like this little nice thing, but then this is just ugly and then... - You plug it directly in, it's fine. Look, everything you need, just ignore this part. - Look. - It looks great now. - Doesn't seem to be doing anything. Okay, well, 0 for one, Let's get Qi. 0 for two. - It helps you turn the power strip on Matt. There we go, charging. How much do you think you would pay for such a lovely invention from the folks over at Walmart? - 19.99. - [Kenzie] 25.88. - 25.88, okay. - If it had the built in Apple Watch charger, it would be a lot nicer instead of having to use your own cable. - If it just had one more USB, that would be a lot better. This does not have wireless charging. - But it has wired charging. It's almost the same thing. - Oh, that feels gross. Oh, that's not a good port. - Matt. - Yeah? - Would you say that you are a fan of entertainment? What if I could tell you that you could experience all of the wonder, glory, and beauty of 4k Google TV thanks to your friends at Walmart. This is a 4K UHD streaming device. We don't need to fire it up because we didn't remember to bring a TV in and we don't have room on the set for it. So you just have to imagine it. But this has full Google TV, just like a Chromecast or a lot of actual TVs have built in. - So it's Android TV according to the box. - Android TV. I believe it comes with the remote as well. Very much a competitor to the Chromecast. (box crashing) - All right, this automatically gets all the points because of one super simple fact. The buttons are for apps that people actually use. All the preloaded buttons are usually basically ad space. - Imagine watching \"House of Dragon\" in 4K with this. How much would you pay for this 4K Android TV streaming box? - $25. - [Kenzie] 19.88. - [Matt] 19.88. - With full Android TV and a nice remote. Look, man. - I give this, this is A tier as long as it works. - Thank you to Niu for sponsoring today's video. We got to try out the brand new KQi3 Max. It's the ultimate thrill and commuter scooter. A fun phrase if I've ever heard one. It's 450 watt rear wheel drive and 48 volt battery. Give you all the juice you need. And with speeds over 20 miles per hour and a 40 mile range, that's a lot of fast range, Matt. - And you too can be running up that hill and she can handle up to a 25% incline grading. - That's actually very steep. - That's very steep. And you'll be safe on your way back down too using the KQi3 state-of-the-art dual disc breaks and you'll get a little bit of extra battery life with the regenerative breaking just like those fancy electric cars. - The KQi3 Max is as comfy and as stable as you'll find. It's got wider tires, deck and handles on the competition. It's also got a 265 pound carrying capacity. You won't find this form, factor or power from anyone else at this price point Niu is also so confident in their product, they're gonna offer you a two year warranty. - And you can get up to 25% off select models this Black Friday. So be sure to check out the link in the description to learn more. And huge shout out to Niu for sponsoring today's video. - Zoom, zoom! While you're enjoying the beauty of all the life has to offer with Android TV. - Yeah. - It's probably time for you to unwind. What's your favorite pastime? - I mean, you know I'm a big fan of karaoke. - Playing games. - Yeah, yeah. - With the Game on Gaming Starter Kit, this has everything you could ever need as an aspiring gamer. Keyboard, a gaming keyboard. You get yourself a gaming mouse, mousepad and a headset. - You can actually check the keys. (box clicking) I built a keyboard out of a cardboard box. - It does sound a little cardboard-y 'cause you're also pressing cardboard as you touch it. - I'll tell you, it doesn't feel great though to be like, all right. - So keyboard. - Well who cares, because it comes with a CD. - What's the CD for? - Boner Jams, 2006. (host laughs) (glass shatters) Oh, oh. - [Host] A lot of stuff. - All right. Hup! (box clatters) The mouse feels quite nice, I'm not gonna lie. That feels really good. The buttons are whatever. - You're really bringing out the Surface right now? - It's the only Windows laptop I use. - So you've got yourself a headset, which does have a removable jack so you can go headphone and microphone or a combo, which is very nice. With your Surface you should be able to just plug this directly in. You also have yourself a high quality keyboard and high quality mouse and mouse pad. I'm not sure what else you could ever ask for. Nice mouse, right? - The DPI is adjustable. - Yeah. - The keyboard is not good. - It does seem a little like it leaves a little bit to be desired. While Matt prepares his high quality gaming Surface. - Oh. - Show up? - Also, this is pair... This right here is available. - Don't pair with the remote, pair with the EarPods. So let me, right here, I'll do it for you. - I wish this was the first time I could say that you put stuff in my ears. Okay, first of all, you put 'em in, (host laughing) put 'em in the wrong ear. - Experience the $12 headphones, Matt. - These are not good. - They're $12. - In order to get any type of volume out of them, I had to go max. - Yeah. - Like at half volume, they are so quiet. Do you want to? - Nah, it's okay. I'll just trust your opinion on this. - You don't want to touch, you don't wanna touch my ear juice? For $12, I don't think these are good headphones. - They were on clearance. I was excited, but it's fine. You can put 'em back in the, that's fine. Why don't you try to play a game on these high quality gaming accessories? It'll totally change your mind about Walmart tech. Jump into whatever you want. You've got Cloud gaming, so the world is your oyster. What do you think about the headset, the mouse and the keyboard? - It's a halfway decent looking keyboard, but it's still a membrane keyboard. - [Host] Yeah, it's got G though. Who needs RGB when you have G? - The real winner in here is this mouse, actually feels really good. We've looked at a bunch of cheap mice in here and this one feels fantastic. - How much would you pay for this high quality Walmart gaming bundle? - I'd say 40 bucks. - [Kenzie] $64. - I don't think 64 is a bad price. But the fact that really, the only thing that's like that is pretty good is this mouse. - You were better off buying individual like the mouse, and then one of the better keyboards and one of the better headsets, yeah. - If they sell this mouse outside the bundle, this is a really good, like. This feels fantastic. - Matt, it's time for you to take your gaming career to the next level. Have you considered becoming a streamer? - I already am. You can go check me out on Twitch sometime. - This is the on 1440p webcam with a built in ring light. - All right, so. - Yeah, just plug it in there. - So it's capacitive. - Mm. - And so you just like, it's not labeled. - I think you just tap the button. - So I mean, if we go to cozy mode in here. - Ooh. Matt, before you test that, you know what you're missing right now in your setup? - What am I? - A high quality USB podcast microphone. I'm sorry to say that you can't record this for streaming. It's only for podcasts, but it's ideal for podcast vlogs and voiceovers with professional sound quality and a cardioid recording pattern. It is quote, \"plug and play.\" - All right, so this is me. We don't need this anymore because I'm recording with this wonderful podcast mic. I did need to tweak this because I'm gonna cut and I'm gonna show you what it looked like by default and it looked really bad. So this is what it looks like with the default settings from the camera. As you can see, a lot worse, a lot more washed out. - [Matt] This is me recording on... - That's with that mic? - Yeah. - Ugh! - So this does not sound good. - So some setup is certainly required for this webcam and microphone set up that might not be delivering incredible results out of the box. How much do you think the camera and the webcam cost, Matt? - Camera, 19.99. - What? For LED and 1440p? No, guess again. - 34.99. - [Kenzie] 30. - 30 bucks for this thing ain't bad. That mic, if it's anything more than 20 bucks. - [Kenzie] 25.88. - [Matt] Nah. - I will say, if that's really what it sounds like, if you actually go and tweak it, it is completely worthless. But my thought is that we've just got some game settings wrong. But that's fine, Matt. I have a very important question for you. - Yeah? - You've now been gaming, you've been streaming. What happens when you wanna upload all your clips to, oh, I don't know, YouTube or shorts or something. You gotta edit 'em, right? And what better way to edit them than with an external SSD? Oh, external SSD. There's too many things on the table. So with your gigabytes and gigabytes of hilarious stream highlights, you can load them up on this. A USB-C external drive. - This is the lightest thing that I've ever felt. This cable weighs more than this SSD. - At least it's USB-C. Wow, that is very light. It's USB-C, at least. 250 gigs up to 400 megabytes per second read and some number of right, I'm sure. How much would you pay for such a high quality SSD from our friends at Walmart? - $35. - [Kenzie] 21.99. - [Matt] 21.99. - [Host] For an SSD of 250 gigs. - This, yeah. I have a feeling that this is just an SD card. - Are you feeling like a streamer? You've got your gaming gear, you've got your webcam, you've got your SSD, your microphone. - Ooh-woo. (police sirens, door slamming) - Well you know what you're missing though? A dope background. Look at all this nonsense on the set. You can't steal that. You need to decorate with a multicolor LED light strip because as we all know, you're not a true gamer if you don't RGB. we'll be right back after we set up this multicolor LED light strip with sound reactive technology. All right, Matt. Are we ready to experience some visual bliss? That's really fast, what? (hands clapping) How good is that? Let's be very quiet. - Oh there we go, all right. - Okay. What a lovely pineapple we have behind us. You realize we can't keep the pineapple anymore, right? - Well we only turn it upside down on Thursday nights after 6:00 PM. - I don't like that. - What a coincidence. It just so happens to be Thursday. - Can we have cozy please? - [Kenzie] No, not after you said that. (host laughs) All right. - Cozy we go. - Aw, look at that. - Look at that. - After you've experienced the visual bliss of this RGB strip and completed your gaming setup, or have you? How much would you pay for this delightful RGB strip. - 20 bucks. - [Kenzie] 11.88. - [Matt] 11.88, that's good, that's good. - [Host] Always low prices baby, let's go! - They on rollback? - So while I was doing my shopping at Walmart, I had the delightful assistance of a very, very kind associate in the tech department who may or may not actually watch the channel. And so my first question to him was, \"What's the best Walmart on branded device you've got?\" And he didn't even blink an eye. He walked straight over and picked a Bluetooth speaker. He said so many people bought these and come back and buy a bunch more 'cause he says they sound legitimately good. So I instantly bought one because he would never lead me astray. - [Matt] Visually, looks good. Actually finding a Bluetooth speaker that doesn't look stupid is actually, this looks really nice. - [Speaker] Power on. - Okay. - And of course you could use this for gaming. I feel like it's not quite a gaming set, but you know what, you've got a little bit of party light on the bottom. You could incorporate this into your streaming setup along with your pineapple. I mean your light strip and everything else in behind. - Let's get some proper music up here, just... (chill music) - Oh, (person grunting) that's pretty good. - That is really good. (sea shanty music) - That's loud. - You got a little party light. - I am legitimately very impressed. - This is the best thing that you've shown me today. - How much would you pay for this medium rugged LED speaker from the wonderful on brand? - I wouldn't bat an eye at $45. - [Kenzie] It is 29.88. - [Matt] Absolute steal. Go out and get one of these immediately. This is actually fantastic. - Well, Matt, if you're gonna go out and steal, you need to actually drive to Walmart. But you know what happens if on the way to Walmart someone tries something nefarious, you gotta make sure you're protected with a dash cam, a dual dash cam. So it has an ultra wide angle lens and it's got a screen. - Feel that. - That's fine, that's not that bad. So what you've got here is a rear facing or a forward facing camera to look out your dash. But then you've got a screen and one facing toward you. So you could see some bozo in a 1994 Ford Focus. Who's going right into the back of you. Shall we take this out to the car and take a little drive, Matt? - Yeah, let's do it. - So by removing the plastic on our webcam, I'm gonna mount it to the car. It does come with a cigarette lighter. So by plugging that in, I should just be able to turn on. Oh, there we go. Oh, it's just, it's already recording. I had to do nothing. There was literally no setup of any kind. So let's pull out of here and see how the 1080p quality is, shall we? So this is what it looks like as you are driving. So you wanna just make sure that you're not doing anything ridiculous or scary. (Matt screams) So, I hope you're not doing anything scary or dangerous in any ways. You just wanna make sure that you're getting the optimal sort of possibilities of the capabilities of your vehicle. (Matt laughs) But it's very important to make sure that if you're doing anything scary or someone gets in your way, you get some very high quality sort of video from it. I will say, looking at the actual image quality, it looks a little blown out. The problem is this will capture someone who's like gonna do something in front of you. I don't think you're gonna be able to get a license plate off of this, but at least you can see Matt's reaction when I do some exciting things in a car, which I'm not gonna do because I'm gonna be very kind and polite. Kenzie, do you know the, do you remember the price off the top of your head? - [Kenzie] It was 39.99. - [Matt] 39.99. I don't know how much a dash cam should cost, but that seems okay. - More than that. - It seems okay. So Walmart, pretty good, right? - I give this a B.",

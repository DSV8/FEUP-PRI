    "transcript": "for it's felt like the last 400 years if you wanted to turn a little office pc like this into a gaming system and you had a bit of money to throw around your best bet has been a low profile gtx 1650 but after long last there seems to be a new contender to the throne of little berber office pc gaming graphics card kings this the rx 6400 but before we see who bows to who it's time for a word from today's video sponsor today's video is sponsored by epidemic sound if you've watched even a single one of my videos you've heard a lot of their music from hits like to oh i really like this one how about some sound effects epidemic sound offers a huge library of high quality royalty-free music and sound effects with the library that's growing by the week and you never have to worry about copyright claims i've teamed up with epidemic sound to bring you an awesome deal sign up to the annual personal plan using my code darvin50 to get 50 off use the link in my description below and enter the code at checkout thank you epidemic sound for sponsoring today's video it comes in such a cute little box just a little sheet letting us know that we don't get a driver disc with it which i feel like is quite evident by the fact that there isn't a cd in the box and a low profile bracket which is what we're most interested in today i'm actually really excited to check out a new low profile graphics card it's been ages since it's been a new one some very emo bubble wrap now you can see we've got an xfx speeder swift rx 6400 i'm really curious to see how this compares to a gtx 1650 because we've actually got the same amount of video memory on here and there is actually also a gddr6 version of the 1650. there we go now as you can see we get a nice powder coated black shroud with a tiny little fan under there and also not a whole lot of heatsink but there does seem to be a little heat pipe under there which is which is cool and then on the back of the graphics card we have really basic video outs we've just got hdmi and a displayport but it does make sense that we didn't get any more than that because well it's it's a little low profile graphics card now one particularly stupid design quirk of this xfx card is that they've hidden one of the screws that you need to undo in order to swap the rear bracket out for a low profile one underneath the cooler shroud which means in order to swap that rear bracket out you either need to remove the entire gpu cooler or undo eight screws to get the shroud off in order to undo that screw which means this entire process takes about three years longer than it could have okay well let's have a look at the insides of this little goliath oh a warranty void of removed sticker xfx that's real naughty oops oh there we go not sure why but that tiny little die does make me feel a bit better about myself for some reason wow that's quite a fat single little heat pipe in there it's quite a cute cooler undercarriage we have here they do actually also have a copper contact plate for the gpu and then under here is our baby rdna 2 die now the specs for that look like this compared to the specs of the gtx 1650 which look like this okay so let's throw a gtx 1650 onto the test bed to get just a baseline reading and then we'll see how this 6400 runs now the brighter of you have probably noticed that this is not a low profile gtx 1650 but this is the best option i have available for this video it is a gddr6 one and we're just going to have to get a rig it into that little bubble pc so with that let's see how it runs that seems perfectly fine oh this is immediately not going very well for the little system we've just shot almost immediately to a hundred percent cpu utilization and uh less than 40 percent on the gpu so clearly even if we threw an rx 6900 xt in this system we wouldn't be getting more than about 40 frames per second in gta 5. wait surely that's not right what cpu is actually in here let's quickly see oh yes okay that kind of makes sense uh we've got an i32130 i actually thought there was an i5 from this generation in here and uh we've only got four gigs of ram so no this system is definitely not a viable use case for a gtx 1650 or the new exciting rx 6400 now after that slightly stupid move on my part we're going to be using this much more powerful lenovo sff system which has an i5 60 in there and we've got a little bit more ram as well so let's plug the 1650 in here and see how much better it runs in this system it's been about 26 hours since the previous bit of video and it has now become increasingly clear that skeletor is living in the system because it has corrupted three separate game drives i don't know maybe after the second one it was my fault but at this point i'm really sick of it every single time i plug a new freshly re several hundred gig game downloaded games drive into this pc even with new windows installs on it and whatever it just immediately corrupts the game drive actually correction there because the second time it debated me into a false sense of security i came in at like nine last night to test half of the games that i downloaded to make sure that i'll be able to use them in here today it didn't corrupt the game drive then but when i plugged it in this morning with more hundred plus gig games downloaded it corrupted it then so it's it's like deliberately screwing me around at this point so uh let me just go set that on fire and then i'll figure out what other configuration we can use and then we'll get back into some regular scheduled programming now unfortunately after that kerfuffle i wasn't quite out the woods yet i then tried to use the internals of an old dell optiplex that had an i5 3470 in it however after doing a bunch of testing that system also started vomiting up ectoplasm so i removed the i5 3470 from that and dropped it back into the original little acer system and i upgraded the ram to a 16 gig kit just to give it a better fighting chance in these tests and this is what happened now it's been way too long and we've already run into a cpu bottleneck now it's running way better than it was before but it seems like the i5 3470 just isn't enough cpu anymore for this tier of graphics card now i still compared the rx 6400 and the gtx 1650 in a couple of games in this kneecapped configuration and despite the cpu bottleneck for some reason the gtx 1650 still holds onto its crown with a narrow lead so let me throw in the thickest cpu i have for this platform the i7 3770 and see how it stacks up yeah i mean it's looking a bit better at least the cpu is not cracked at 100 anymore and this is as far as we can go with this platform so it's going to be fine right well the 3770s still struggling to keep up with the 1650 in this setup but this is pretty much a best case scenario for an older small form factor office pc these systems are really starting to get long in the tooth so now that suspense has built to climax levels it's finally time to drop the little rx 6400 in here this offers a really usable gaming experience and one thing that really stands out to me here is the power draw i mean it's like 20 watts of power draw and we're getting over 60 frames per second at 1080p high settings in gta 5. although despite the fact that we're just drawing about 20 watts of power uh we're already in 73 degrees celsius so that is not super promising in terms of actual cooler performance wow battlefield 5 a 1080p medium is running very well although again battlefield 5 and amd do have a deep hot romance we're getting really high frame rates here for just 40 watts of power draw that is that is very impressive although again the little cooler is quite noisy it's not a great cooler but i think other versions of the 6400 should be good okay well cyberpunk at 1080p low settings is not faring quite as well as the first two games but this is still very playable and uh considering that we're getting about 50ish frames per second with 30 watts of power draw like yeah this is this is honestly quite impressive but yeah anyway we can see how the card runs now so now let's get into the comparative benchmarks between the rx 6400 and the gtx 1650 so in these older pcie gen 3 office pcs they trade blows and considering that the rx 6400 has basically the same power draw as a gt 1030 i think that's very impressive and considering that it is very hard to find a low profile gtx 1650 in stock these days the rx 6400 is pretty much your best bet but then the final thing that i want to say is amd why did you not put an h.264 encoder on this card so that you can capture gameplay with it it drives me crazy that amd's been doing this with their new budget graphics cards it's 2022 just give us an h.264 encoder but anyway that brings me to the end of the video thank you very much for watching and until the next video bye",

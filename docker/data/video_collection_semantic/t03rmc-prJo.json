    "transcript": "(upbeat music) - This custom gaming PC represents over 600 hours of work and the full hard line water cooling setup, barely scratches the surface. Look at this. It is beyond the doubt, the most beautiful rig we have ever built, which means, obviously we had a little help. Nerdforge is here. - Hey. - And we're gonna be showing them how to hardline water cooler system, as well as how to thank our sponsor Seasonic who made this collaboration possible. Let me put it this way, flights from Norway, not cheap. Shout out Seasonic, and shout out Nerdforge you guys are gonna have a lot of fun with this one, because you have only seen two sides of it, it get so much better. (bright upbeat music) - How many hours do you have in this Pelican case? - [Martina] Well, two weeks, 12 hours a day, four, three people. I dunno, it's a lot of math. - How many hours was your flight? - Nine hours was the last flight and then two hours for the first. So it's been shaking nicely. - [Alex] What's it like? - A lot of foam. It seems fine so far. This is the front panel. - [Alex] Oh my God. - Okay, it seems fine, at least on first glance, but I don't know about the lights. And this is the even bigger parts. I'm sorry about all the foam. - The hotel sign seems to not be doing well. - Oh no, I brought super glue don't worry. - [Alex] We have a whole week. - Yes. - [Alex] Oh, and there's people. - Oh, he survived. It seems like most of the things are okay. Like even the screen, but we also have to test the lights though to see that they work. - Oh, should we do that right now? - Yes. - Is it all powered off of the SATA connector? - Yes. So there's one for each panel. - By the way, huge thank you Seasonic. Plane tickets are not cheap, because we're showing off their 1600 watt, we were able to afford it. - It's arrived. - Oh my God. - Oh my God. I'm so happy. - [Alex] Oh, the lanterns. - [Martina] Yes, it's my favorite part. - [Alex] How did you program that? - They're just fire LEDs like these prefabricated fire ones. They have the flicker effect. - [Alex] How is this done? - It's a photo frame, like a digital photo frame that we just kind of hijacked. - The photo frame runs Android, I just basically bricked it, so it continuously runs the boot animation and the boot animation is what you're seeing. It is a boot animation on repeat. - [Martina] I mean, it works. - How does this, - Uh well, - Get to that? - I cut a hole in the mesh as you're not supposed to do. - That's fine. - Probably. We take the front panel, and I'm kind of just lured it in there. - Oh. - And then looped it over there, and hopefully we can covered it up with something nice. And then the side panel, we just load it between here, and then stack on the inside. And then if this is the same, we can just close it. - Oh, it slots together like, oh my God. - [Martina] It looks better like this when it's like together. - Do you wanna start building the computer? - Yes, let's go. - EK, (table bangs) hooked us up with so much stuff for this. - Oh my God. I'm sorry, but this is the first thing I see. - Yeah, I think we have a couple of options. I think they're all slightly different purples. - I love purple. - [Alex] We also have all of our cables. - I didn't know you can get them in purple. It matches my hair. (Martina laughing) - Reservoir, radiator. - Also huge. - Two more radiators I think. Thank you. This guy right here, that's the mono block for the CPU and oh my God that's heavy. And now our GPU block. We also went with acrylic tubing. Your options are pet G and acrylic. Pet G is easier to work with, acrylic looks a little bit better. I went with acrylic. - Always for the aesthetics. I mean, I'm all for it. (Martina laughs) - First thing we have to do is remove this GPU water block and put on the other GPU water block. This one's perfectly fine. This is from Alphacool. - Should I do it? - Yeah, you can do it. - To be fair, I have built a PC once. - This is the same thing, it's just, if you screw it up, it leaks and kills all your stuff. - It's really heavy. - Yeah, what's on the back? Oh my God, it's a whole other block. - I'm so afraid of ruining it. - [Alex] You cannot do anything worse to this GPU than it's already been done. - Ah, very nice. I need that screwdriver 'cause I keep losing my bits. Should I just like eyeball it? - [Alex] Yeah, it's fine. - Oh, that's pretty good. I mean, wow, I managed to cut something. (Martina laughs) - I just need to cover that up. - Oh, that's very nice. In a weird way. Does it have to be even? - I think you're doing a better job than I would've done so. - Great. Perfect. - There you go. Your first water blocked GPU. - Are we gonna be able to see the cooling liquid? - Oh yeah. - Motherboard? - Yep, there's a couple things to note about this, for one, this board's like $1,200. It's like the most expensive motherboard you can buy pretty much. Aside from like servers. Also, I've had my way with this CPU, it's full copper for one, also the IHS just falls off. - Is it supposed to do that? - No, it's not supposed to do that. - So we just need to like, not touch it. And as long as we just like leave it in there it's fine. - Okay. - Anyway, this is what needs to go on. - [Martina] That's gorgeous. - Okay, it's gonna be a bit of pain in the arse. this back plate, all these VRM coolers and stuff have to come off, then it's similar to the GPU block, thermal pads, stick this on. - Why is this so scary. It's too little, I have no idea. - The comments can tell her. How was that? - Oh no, thanks. - That's probably too much. - I'll know for next time. It's so pretty. - We need a it's so pretty counter. (Martina laughing) - Oh no. - You kind of see where this mother board's been wet before. Kind of see the water coming all along here. That's for when we sub zeroed it. We have a rough plan for our loop and I think it's gonna look fricking sweet. Particularly look at the size of this reservoir that we found. - We do have one problem though. The 7,000D despite having like, cutouts right here for a vertical GPU, does not have an included PCI-E riser for the GPU. Do you wanna cut some holes on a case? - Sure. Why not? (Martina laughs) - [Alex] No, not quite. - That is terrifying. (metal snaps) Ah, okay. It did work. Nice. Okay. - [Brandon] Safety glasses. - You use safety glasses for drilling? (Martina laughing) I'll follow the rules. Do I look cool now? - [Brandon] Yeah, 10 times more cool. - Thank you. (drill buzzing) Cool points added. Let's go. Always scary. (drill buzzing) Okay, easy. Nice. - Do you know what? Something that's really dumb, that I realized after you tapped it, this has a little bit on the top that's not threaded so you didn't need to tap it at all. All right, we have a functional vertical mount now. PCI-E brackets in there, nice and good with their standoffs. You want to know the plan? - Is the plan to have this actually screwed in all the way? - Well, it was pretty screwed in, but you can-- - Now it's screwed up. - Yeah, we've got a couple pretty fun runs in this. So from here, the outlet of the pump, up, over and into the GPU right here is gonna be pretty fun. - What the hell Alex? - And then from here up over the RAM and into this one also will be pretty fun. - What the hell Alex? Oh my God they're totally not aligned Alex. They're off by like at least six, seven mills. You don't need the computer to look good, do you? - I mean. - Well, I guess let's get started, shall we? You should have gone to JayzTwoCents. It might have taken four years to get the finished build, but boy, would it ever look nice? - You're gonna have a lot of difficulty making a 90 that's that tight. It would be way easier to freehand bend it from here up to there. - Oh my God, it would not. - It would. How many PCs have you water cooled in the last couple of years? (bird cackling) - Really? You're gonna go there. - [Alex] Yeah. - On camera. - [Alex] Yeah. - Where does this dam-- - I feel like I'm observing a married couple. - Do you really think you can do that 90? - Oh, I can do that 90. - All right, first one we're doing that 90. - Pro PC building tip. This is an excellent switch. So if he's bothering you, you grab one of these. - Okay. - This is a practice bend. This is going to take me two attempts. Basically what we're doing is we are taking the hard tubing and we are making it soft. So we're showing it a picture of its grandma. (Martina laughing) Okay, when we can see that it's starting to get a little bit flexible. We wanna make sure that we heat up more than just the exact area, and then we're gonna go ahead and give it a little, 90 dish degree bend here. Oh God, I screwed it up so badly. You gotta make sure you heat it evenly on all sides and you don't wanna get any bubbles in it. Alex may be right about the bend radius here. So you can see the tubing is still curved, when it's going in, so we're not gonna get a good seal because it's been deformed. It's no longer perfectly round. But hold on, hold on, everybody just calmed down for a second here, okay? - This is a lot more stressful than I thought. - [Linus] Relax. - Okay. - There is another option. See, if we do that, it fits. - [Martina] Yeah. - And then we can have a perfect 90 degree, well, not perfect, but we'll make a better one. There no. - [Alex] We could just make this one even bigger. - Yeah, what if that goes up and bend down? - Well, yeah, that could work. All right, I gotta do this again but slower. We're definitely gonna need higher temperature later. Crap, I really wish this bend wasn't like front and center. Whose idea was it to start with this one? - [Alex] It's also like one of the easiest ones. - That's fair. Yeah, it kinked a little. - [Alex] Let's put it in and see if you notice. - Yeah, when you see it from the front, you can't even see it. - I kind of wanna take one more stab at it. - Okay, Linus. - Yeah. - We get that one in there, we see if we still have tubing left. (Martina laughing) - So it needs to be a little shorter here. I would take this off and I would put it on the belt sander, take off maybe a couple of millimeters. How's this side? - That's pretty bad. - Oh God. Oh, this side's much worse. Well, you can't do any worse than me. Let's go. - I'm not so sure but, okay, which one do I do? - Okay, so what about what we do one bend first. We do the bend for right here, so we know that it's clears, we get it in the correct spot, then we do the second bend. It comes down to this. - And then cut it? - Yeah. - Sure. - Sorry. - All right. - Just remember, you couldn't possibly do any worse than me. As long as it's 45 ish you're in pretty good shape. Make sure you get the underside too though, otherwise it'll crumple up. That's looking pretty 45 ish to me. Yeah, you can really see the flaws when you pull out the thing, there you go. - [Martina] Oh, yeah. - See, it's perfect. - Oh, I'm so relieved. - Now, our bend here is also quite flexible in terms of where we put it. It just determines how tight the angle will be. If we put it here, then it would need to be like a 90 degree. - [Martina] Makes sense. - Probably what you want is somewhere in between. So somewhere around here, down like that. What we should also do at this stage, is we can cut the piece, so we can cut it like here. (machine grinding) - It's an awful sound. - Truly. Okay, it's starting to loosen. - Yep. - [Alex] Now remember, same plane. - Yeah, time to commit. This is less good than your last one, but still better than mine. - [Martina] Okay. - Can I borrow this for just a sec? - Yes. - [Linus] We're just gonna give her a little, kinda-- - A little wiggle. - Yep, a little wiggle. - Wiggle it, put in there. - We're trying, okay. - [Martina] Good enough? - If it's good enough for you, it's good enough for me. Look, from no, no, you'll never look at it that way, right? - That is true. - See? So how's that? - Yeah, it's nice. - So now all we need to do, is we just play around with, exactly where we want it to kind of land. We are pretty darn close, do you wanna just double check? - Yeah, that looks pretty good. - Does that look pretty good? Okay, go ahead and mark it. - And 1/2 a centimeter extra? - Yeah. - If you'll even be able to see that. - I got it. I got it, I got it, I got it. (machine grinding) Okay, so you can see right now they're both seated, and it goes down that way a little bit. - Yeah. - Right? - Yeah. - So this is a perfect opportunity for us to make fine adjustments with the belt sander. Yeah, let's just take off like that. - Right. - So when that's gone, we're done. - Should probably try to keep it like as straight as possible I assume. - Ideally. (machine buzzing) Beautiful. - That's all? - [Linus] So now we'll just pick the bits off. - There. That's much better. - [Linus] What? Perfect. Freaking nailed it. - [Martina] Nice. - You know what? I think her screwing up the plane at the bend actually worked in your favor. It comes out, I think it corrects it a little bit. - [Martina] It was you plan all along. - Can I take another crack at my 90? Do I get another shot of it? - I really think we should just not do it that way. Think about how hard this one's going to be if we have to go up and over. - Hear me out a 90 and a 90 and we just go straight over and we do another extension here. Then we only have to do one 90. - [Alex] Sure. - Basically this is what I have in mind though. Then we just come out like that. - So let's see if I can put all, I've just learned to use, there, and then add a couple extra centimeters. Nice. - Make sure to keep moving, like horizontally as well. - Right. Close. - [Alex] It is looking very good. - I think it's like slightly more than 90. - Ah, you can really tell it's not 90 degrees. Oh, that looks so much better. - If we did this. Ah, this is why you save the scraps. (machine buzzing) I think that's good. It's a little bit like leaning, but close enough. You can't see it from the front. - Not bad. Do you think it leaks? - I don't know. - We haven't probably like tightened everything yet, but I am kind of curious if we just, you know, pump it up a little bit, will it stay? - Well, that was fast. - We'll try it again with less pressure. - Okay. - Just leave it. (upbeat music) This is going a lot better than I expected. We have a water cooled system that doesn't leak. - That's pretty good. - What should we do? (Martina laughing) - We could do some painting. Like this part, maybe, make it match the outside. - Can I learn how to paint? - Yeah. - We did an LMG paint night and mine was definitely the worst. - [Martina] Oh no. (Martina laughs) - All right, we have the insides of the computer figured out, so we took them all out, and now we're going to make this, you know, fit with the rest of all the stuff that they've done. What's really exciting, is we can finally use our sand blaster for something. - Yes. - With a little test piece here, it looks fricking sweet. And by opening up the top, we can fit this whole case inside, it's gonna look awesome. - Yes. - Turn it on up there. You have two gloves in here. Foot pedal to spray the sand around. - Okay. - It just simply recirculates, so spray the thing, sand collects down below. - And then you just blast everything. - [Alex] Yeah. (sand blaster buzzing) - These gloves are way too large. Oh, there we go. That is so satisfying, oh my God. - In hindsight, sandblasting that was a terrible idea. So we have finished beads, they take forever to strip paint. Also the painting on their powder coating, really good and durable, thank you CORSAIR. Also, our air compressor, not able to just flat out sandblast for a while, especially when your laser cutting at the same time. So it's five hours later, totally worth it though. - It looks so much better. - Oh yeah. (water splattering) - I don't know why, but it looks so violent. Now that we have it nice and shiny, let's make it dirty again. - Oh, beautiful. - Yes. - What is this? - It's just the mix of black paint and water. Spray the whole thing, grab some paper towels, and dab it off again. Cover it completely. - Completely, but we just made it not black. - Yes, and now we're gonna make it black, where we're gonna take it off again. I know this seems very wrong, but it's gonna be nice. - [Alex] This does seem very wrong. - So now, just grab a bunch of this, and then we can just like dab it off again. We're gonna take off like almost everything, but just give it some nice texture. It's kind of like a time attack thing too, because you gotta get it off before it drys completely. I kinda like this-- - [Alex] Yeah, I kinda like it there. - 'Cause it's like, if we go too much darker, it just becomes black again. - Yeah, it becomes, why did we spend five hours sandblasting it? What was the paint we used? - It's a super matte black paint from Stewart sample. - While we were doing the sand blasting, we also had another thing in the oven. This right here, is our cable management cover. We know that all of you are going to be commenting, \"Oh, Cyberpunk, the game, the game's not fair.\" Cyberpunk's a whole aesthetic, not just a game. So we wrote three paragraphs about it. - Final step, dry brushing. It's super simple. You just grab a brush, and apply as little paint as possible, and then you just like dab it on, on like the high points. And then you get some nice like edge lighting. The only like scary part is getting too much paint because then you get streaks and you don't want streaks. Kind of work it in, to your brush, get it off, make sure there's almost nothing on it. - [Alex] I can't even tell, is that too much streaks. - It's doing really good, but if it gets streaks, you can also just like wipe it off with your finger. It's the best tools. Like that, yeah, perfect. Just like really ram it in. And don't use a brush you like for this, because it's gonna go.. Oh, nice. The highlights help so much, even though they're so subtle. - [Alex] I have a bit too much in here somewhere. - Yeah, at this point. If you don't have paint all over your hands after this, you've done it wrong. Just look at this. That looks awesome. I think you did a great job. - Oh, thank you. - Yeah. (both laughing) - Oh geez, there's a lot to do here. Today, all that we have to do to get this done is reassemble the case, install the components, put fancy washers on the radiators, wear the CORSAIR RGB, engrave the side panel, reinstall the hard line to the cables, cable management, fill the loop, post the computer, update windows, do the RGB software. (beeping) Well, the computer's working just fine. - This is great. - We went to plug in the RGB header on the inside, which just fell off and, that's a lot of water. - [Martina] That is a lot of water. - [Alex] I guess, did it disconnect right here? - [Martina] Yeah, it did. - That's the LED of the pump. So what we've done, we've swapped out some of the fittings. Unfortunately, these ones are Alphacool. They aren't quite color matched, but they do have two O-rings. And I want to be clear here that Alphacool's fittings are inherently better than EK's, I just specked at these super low profile ones, because I thought that they looked cool and was a bit concerned that they wouldn't be as good in holding tubes in, and I was correct. Only use these if you really need to. Everything's dried off now though, so all that we have to do is a bit of cable management. It's not as tidy around here. I absolutely hate RGB. This is all RGB, that's all RGB, this is RGB. (whimsical music) We filled the loop last night, let it go for a while, came back, pump wasn't working. Fortunately, when I went to go and drain it, I did one last little click of the pump and it sprayed water all over the place. You can see the water on the ground right here, which means the pump's working, and we can finally put this together for once and for all. Say your tagline, please. - Let's have a look at the final result. (upbeat music) - [Girl] NanoCyte, appreciate, (music drowns other sounds) (motorbike engine revving) (upbeat punk music) - [Announcer] Hyperion bikes, made for speed. - [Narrator] NanoCyte, appreciate the little things in life, with our new microscopic vision implants, available now at LTTstore.com. (upbeat music) (foreboding music) - [Linus] Oh my God, that looks so good. Did you make this? - [Martina] It's 3D printed, but it's hand painted, yes. - How did you paint the ones in the back? (Martina laughing) Okay, please tell me you took some shortcuts, like all these air conditioners, right? Like did you hand paint every fan blade? - [Martina] Everything is hand painted, yes. - Why? I mean, it's incredible, don't get me wrong, but like.. - Aesthetics. It's still the aesthetics. - Oh my God, it goes around the front too. This is so cool. And this is not a display. You just, I guess, have a technique for, oh yeah, it's just got like a nice diffuser layer in there, I guess. - Yeah. (both laughing) It loops around, it loops around. - [Linus] Of course it does. - [Martina] Yeah. Yeah. - I love these nice little touches, to give it that kind of true to life, look, like the little aluminum foil bits here. Excuse me, aluminium foil, European. How did your tubing bends work out? - Not too bad. I mean, if you go around. - Okay. Okay. Should I turn it or should we walk around? How fragile is it? - It's sort of fragile. Like this is old car stack, so you can like, you can hit it. - What? Did you just like carve this or what? - [Martina] This is just take away boxes. Like the pattern here. - Oh, I love the side panel. You left the peel on those. Is that on purpose? - It's for you. - Oh, okay, all right. Here we go. (plastic rattling) This looks awesome. How are you so much better at bending tubing than me? You've done it like four times. Wow, I love the dye color. You know, there's a lot of really talented PC moderns out there. It's like this micro niche. Whereas if you take the miniature scene, which is much bigger and are like, okay, you super talented people build the PC, I guess this is what you end up with. - [Martina] Well, we combine our powers, right? - [Linus] Next level, man. - [Martina] It wouldn't have been this good on the inside without Alex. - This is like the coolest computer I think I have ever seen. - That is the biggest compliment. - [Brandon] Show him the essay. - The essay? (Martina laughing) - Yes. - [Brandon] Also that it just comes apart. - As much as I respect, I already agree with you. CD projekt red in their ambitions with Cyberpunk, 2077. I dislike how the game has become the defacto standard for the Cyberpunk aesthetic. I'm sure this would be okay if the game wasn't a steaming pile of experiment on release, but unfortunately it was. Did you write this? - The bottom part, Alex wrote the rest. (both laughing) - How the hell are you guys gonna take this back with you? - We're not, it's staying here, forever. - Oh really? - Yeah. - Oh my God, that is so generous. So why don't we just hold onto it, until we do LTX 2023, and then why don't we auction it for charity? - [Alex] Sure. - Does that work for everybody? - That's amazing. - You guys are invited of course, we'll be happy to cover your airfare, because this is like a piece of PC building history. I think it would be really, really cool. And by the way, don't feel any pressure. If you can't make it out, that's fine. - I'm sure we'll be able to. - Whatever works for you, but I would be, I'd be honored if you came out and were there to kind of see us send it off in style. - [Martina] That would be amazing. - Okay, you know what else is amazing? This message from our sponsor. Hey, got 'em. - It's a full sponsored video by Seasonic. - Oh right, Seasonic. Man, how cool is Seasonic? They sponsor all the coolest stuff lately man. They offer up to 12 year warranties, up to 80 plus titanium efficient power supplies and you can check them out at the link down below. - [Alex] It's a new power supply, 1600 watts. - Oh wow, they have a 1600 watt unit now. Is that the unit that's featured in here? - [Alex] Yeah. - Well that's fortunate, because with the rumored power draw of upcoming GPUs, we need something that's gonna be ready for them. Thank you so much for building this. This is incredible. Are you a hugger? - Yeah, I am. - You are, okay. - This has been so much fun to build and yeah, I'm just super happy to be a part of this. - I love it.",

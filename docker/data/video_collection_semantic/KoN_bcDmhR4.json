    "transcript": "(audience clapping) - Good morning, good morning. For years, we've been pursuing our vision of a mobile AI assistant that you can work with, so we've completely rebuilt the entire assistant experience around our Gemini models. - With your permission, a truly capable AI assistant can help connect your relevant personal data with all the valuable knowledge that Google has organized and made accessible, like create a daily workout routine based on my personal trainer's email, or use my resume in Google Drive to write a new bio for work, or even based on my friend's dietary restrictions listed in Keep, can we go out to eat seafood paella? And for some of the most sensitive use cases, like summarizing audio from a phone call or suggesting a helpful reply to an encrypted text message, we've pioneered on-device generative AI with Gemini Nano. It's the first time a large multimodal AI model has been optimized for a mobile device, so the data never leaves your phone. - Gemini is multimodal, which means it can go beyond text to images and videos. All of the demos we're doing today are live by the way. So, if I happen to come across this concert poster for Sabrina Carpenter, I'll just open Gemini, take a photo, and ask, \"Check my calendar and see if I'm free when she's coming to San Francisco this year.\" Gemini pulls relevant content from the image, connects with my calendar, and gives me the information I'm looking for. Oh, looks like we had a little demo issue. Let me try one more time. All right, check my calendar and see if I'm free when she's coming to San Francisco this year. Let's see if the demo spirits are with us today. Nope, uh-oh, looks like they're not with us. All right, let me try that one more time on another device. Sorry about this folks. Whoops, let me go back. All right, I'm gonna take that photo. One more time, check my calendar and see if I'm free when she's coming to San Francisco this year. All right, there we go. (audience cheering and applauding) Thank you demo spirits. And now I'll ask Gemini to set a reminder to check ticket prices tonight at seven. That's if she's free (laughs), I mean, sorry, if they haven't sold out already (laughs). Gemini connects to my Tasks app and just like that (audience cheering) the reminder is set. - Gemini can also understand what I show it on my screen. As I'm wrapping up the video I'll bring up Gemini like this, press here, and say, \"Create a list of the foods she eats in this video.\" So, here Gemini is connecting with YouTube to find relevant information from the video's captions. And look, just like that I have a scavenger hunt. (audience cheering) - But we believe a truly helpful personal AI assistant must do more. That's why I am so excited about Gemini Live. Let me show you how it works. And just like the demos that you just saw with Jess and Dave, this is a totally live demo. When I first go live with Gemini there will be 10 different voices for me to choose from. Let's meet a few. (Gemini chiming) - [Vega] Great, let's get going. Here's one of the voices I have. - [Dipper] Here's another voice I can use. You can pick me now and always make a change later in Settings. - [Ursa] Or maybe you'd like to listen to a voice like this. - Hi Gemini, how are you doing? - [Gemini] Hi there, I'm doing well. Thanks for asking. It's always nice to hear from someone. How can I help you today? - Well, my niece and nephew are coming over this weekend, and I need a few ideas for something fun and educational we could do together. I was thinking maybe something with chemistry, something that's like a little bit magical. - [Gemini] That sounds like a fantastic idea. How about doing a classic science experiment like making a homemade volcano? It's super easy, and there's a real sense of excitement when it erupts. - Gemini Live is available first in English to Gemini Advanced subscribers. And everything we just showed you, including Live, is beginning to roll out today and over the next few weeks on Pixel, Samsung, and other Android phones. - We have four new phones, including the gorgeous new Pixel 9 and the reimagined Pixel 9 Pro Fold. And we've heard from Pixel users that just because they want a Pro phone doesn't necessarily mean they want a big phone. So, for the first time you can choose between Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL. Thanks to the luxurious metal frame with its seamless rounded corners and the scratch resistant, flat Gorilla Glass Victus 2, the Pixel 9 phones are twice as durable as the previous generation. Pixel 9 has an even brighter Actua display, and the Pro models use our Super Actua displays. Underneath that bright display there's a new ultrasonic sensor for fingerprint unlock that's now 50% faster. We've developed a diverse collection of striking colors. The new Google Tensor G4 chip, our fourth-generation processor, is our fastest and most efficient yet. Pixel 9 is the first phone to launch with Gemini Nano with multimodality. The TPU in Tensor G4 can generate an industry-leading mobile output rate of up to 45 tokens per second. We've also upgraded the memory across the entire Pixel 9 family with 12 gigabytes of RAM for Pixel 9, and the Pro models come with 16 gigabytes. We're introducing a new vapor chamber in Pixel 9 Pro, a more advanced cooling technology to make sure your phone can maintain peak performance even when it's working hard for you. Pixel 9 phones deliver significantly more battery life than last year's devices. The entire line of Pixel 9s are also the first Android phones to include our new Satellite SOS, so you can contact emergency responders and share your location even without cellular service. Satellite SOS will be available first in the US on Pixel 9 devices regardless of your carrier plan. Now, all those Pixel enhancements are also coming to our most forward-looking, most versatile phone, Pixel 9 Pro Fold. (audience clapping) It's noticeably thinner and lighter than our first-gen foldable. When it's folded it has the same size display as Pixel 9 Pro and comparable thickness too. It feels and functions like a phone. Then you unfold it, an eight-inch tablet with a big and bright Super Actua Flex display. It's the largest display on a phone, and it's 80% brighter than the first generation. And you're getting the same Tensor G4 and 16 gigabytes of RAM to power great new features that are just for foldables. Pixel 9 starts at 799. Pixel 9 Pro comes in two sizes, starting at 999. Pixel 9 Pro Fold starts at 1,799. The entire Pixel 9 family is available for pre-order today in the US, Japan, and Europe. Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro XL will begin shipping on August 22nd with the rest of the phones starting to ship in September. So, all three Pro phones come with one year of Gemini Advanced and two terabytes of Cloud storage. - One of the most common things we do on our phone is check the weather. So, we're using AI to make that experience much more helpful and delightful with the new Pixel Weather app. You can see the app is beautifully designed with super accurate weather forecasts. And Gemini Nano generates a custom AI weather report, so you don't have to scroll through a bunch of numbers to get a sense of the day's weather. And you can even customize the app based on what you want to see. Maybe you're keeping an eye on the UV index to see if you need to put on sunscreen. You can just drag and drop it. For years Pixel Call Assist has been blocking spam callers, and now Pixel Call Assist gets even better with Call Notes, which follows up on your phone calls with a completely private summary of the conversation. It's easy to activate it, which notifies everyone on the call. And then your Pixel will start transcribing and summarizing. Pixel Screenshots analyzes the content of the image and makes it searchable. Let's see, I'll quickly add this to my collection of gift ideas and make a note that Christine likes this. And if I wanna look through all the other gift ideas I've saved I can open up the Pixel Screenshots app, and I'll just navigate to that collection. And because Pixel Screenshots is designed to extract the information within an image, I can also type in more complex queries like T-shirt price. And here you can see Pixel Screenshots didn't just find the original image, but it also provided me with an answer in natural language based on the information in the image. And Pixel Screenshots can even remember where I grabbed each screenshot, so I could tap to go back to where I found them and buy that shirt. Pixel Screenshots is shipping with all of our new Pixel 9 devices. Every Pixel 9 phone ships with the new Pixel Studio, a first-of-its-kind image generator. It's powered by an on-device diffusion model running on Tensor G4 and our Imagen 3 text-to-image model in the Cloud. So, you can just type whatever you want to create. - The award-winning Pixel camera is the world's first AI-powered camera experience. This year we've rebuilt our signature HDR+ pipeline from the ground up. - We've made improvements across exposure, sharpness, detail, contrast, tone mapping, and white balance. And the difference is remarkable with more accurate skin tones, textures, shadows, and even better Night Sight for exquisite, low-light shots. And we're bringing that same HDR+ pipeline to Panorama. We've rebuilt Pixel 9's Panorama mode starting with the UI, which now intuitively guides your hand. Once you've captured the full scene Pixel runs the photos through the full image processing pipeline for gorgeous, incredibly detailed panoramas. And by the way, the image processing includes Night Sight. - We made group photos a lot better last year with Best Take, but one of the biggest problems with group photos is how to include the entire group. The new Add Me fixes that. So, you can be included in your family vacation photo or that once-in-a-lifetime photo with your favorite athlete. - [Kenny] All right, there we go. So, I'm gonna pop over to that Add Me mode, I'm gonna frame up the shots, make sure I include a little room on the right here for myself, and boom. Now, Shenaz, this is Jimmy Buckets, please, I need, - I know, I know. - add a little me. - Let's get you in the picture. - You need to add. - Let's get Kenny in the picture. - Let's go, let's go! - As you can see, the overlay, the augmented reality overlay, is guiding me, and now I can take a photo. And now if you both come over here you will see that it is going to be processed in one single shot. (audience cheering) And now let me show you what we are doing with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold to solve another tricky challenge in photography, getting a fussy toddler to look at the camera and smile. The new Made You Look is here to help. Just turn it on and pick one of the fun, colorful visuals at your outer screen, each with its own personality and sounds to get your child's attention on the camera. (audience laughing) Made You Look gets your baby smiling (audience laughing) so you can capture a happy memory and that elusive perfect baby photo. - Pixel 9 Pro Fold includes lots of other foldable camera features too. You get Dual Screen Preview, which lets both you and your subject see how the shot's going to turn out. And Rear Camera Selfies, so every shot you take is taken with the best camera on your phone. This year we've also added Pro Controls with professional camera features like shutter speed, manual focus, and more. - We are also improving the accessibility of Pixel camera across the entire Pixel 9 family. With Guided Frame people who have blindness or low vision can take great photos and selfies. Guided Frame now offers even better face angle guidance and lets you know when you might need to improve your lighting, and it's now easier to enable right from the camera settings. - Now, Pixel camera isn't just about taking gorgeous photos and videos, it also helps you with everything that happens after you've got the photo. And we're continuing it today with the evolved Magic Editor experience using generative AI. This is where Auto Frame in Magic Editor comes in. It uses generative AI to recompose my image, applying photographic techniques like rule of thirds and golden ratios. Okay, so right now it's filling in the blanks and finding the perfect crop to reframe my subject. And wow, that is awesome. Let's go with this one, this looks awesome. And if you notice, it even recovered the piece of his shoe that got left out of the first photo. Let's say we wanted to reimagine this photo entirely. I can just tap on the grass here and type what I wanna see. So, I'll just type in Wildflowers. And again, remember, this is a live demo of generative AI. We're all going to see these results the same time together. (audience laughing) They're gonna be great, I promise. - [Shenaz] Oh definitely. And it's still cooking those wildflowers. Ooh, ooh. - Ooh. (audience clapping) The evolved Magic Editor is available right out of the box on all the new Pixel 9 phones. - Pixel's video continues to make big leaps forward thanks to a computational video technology called Dual Exposure. In simple terms, it takes two exposures at the same time, one optimized for shadows and another optimized for highlights, and combines them to use the best of both in real time. - [Kenny] At the same time we're adding new capabilities to Video Boost for our Pixel 9 Pro phones. It sets a new bar for mobile video by combining Tensor and the camera hardware on the device with our full HDR+ pipeline in the Cloud. - [Shenaz] We've improved Night Sight Video so your low-light videos are even more natural, brighter, and more detailed. And we are moving Video Boost to Tensor processing units in the Cloud, so when you enable Video Boost it will now render your videos up to twice as fast. - When we combine Video Boost with the brand new 5x telephoto camera in Pixel 9 Pro, you can now shoot super-high resolution zoom videos up to 20x. And check this out, we're also using generative AI and Video Boost TPUs to upscale your videos to 8K resolution even though you're shooting 4K video. The quality and resolution are so high you can even pull high quality, 33-megapixel still photos from any frame. - With Pixel Watch 3 we are bringing our best lineup yet. It delivers our gorgeous, iconic design, for the first time ever in two sizes. We are introducing an all new 45-millimeter size that's perfect for people who want more from their watch. It gives you 40% more display and a 35% bigger battery. You also get our custom design, durable 3D cover glass and a brand new Actua display. With up to 2,000 nits of brightness it's twice as bright as before, and it flexes all the way down to one nit in a dark room. The smaller 41 millimeter uses the same Actua technology, giving you 10% more display in the same compact size. Your watch can now live stream your Nest camera and doorbell, control your Pixel phone's camera, and act as your Google TV remote. You can use Google Maps even when offline, and take notes with the Recorder app. This year we are introducing our most comprehensive fitness experience yet. I can build custom workouts, add intervals, set targets to them, build tempo runs. And with Fitbit Premium Google AI does the legwork for me by automatically building these workouts personalized just for me. And during my run I get real-time guidance. And across everything you do with your Pixel Watch 3, you're getting highly accurate heart-rate tracking with continuous sampling, not just during workouts but all day and all night. Now, fitness isn't just about going all out on workouts, it's also about balancing that intensity with my body's need for recovery. To help find that balance we are introducing three new tools. First, an all new Readiness Score. It combines sleep, heart rate variability, resting heart rate, to give me a holistic picture of how ready I am to train. Second, a new metric called Cardio Load. It tracks my heart's exertion during workouts and helps me understand if I'm overtraining or undertraining. And third, a personalized daily target load that combines the Readiness and Cardio Load metrics to guide me how much intensity to take on each day. And all these insights come together in the new Fitbit Morning Brief, along with weather, my sleep insights, and how I'm tracking against my weekly exercise goals. Today I'm excited to share a pioneering innovation, a first-of-its-kind capability, called Loss of Pulse Detection. - [Narrator] So, we've built a Loss of Pulse Detection feature for the Pixel Watch that is the first of its kind. It can detect if someone has lost their pulse, is non-responsive, and can make a call to Emergency Medical Services where key information is provided like the location of where the user is so they can get help as quickly as possible. - It's all coming together on the new Pixel Watch 3, starting at 349 for the 41 millimeter and 399 for the all new 45 millimeter. All right, I'm equally thrilled to share our final product today, the new Pixel Buds Pro 2. We have made a multi-year investment and designed our very own chip, the new Google Tensor A1. Tensor A1 brings ultra-low latency audio processing, adapting to your sound environment up to 3 million times per second. And the result is active noise cancellation that is two times as strong as our previous generation earbuds. We re-engineered the entire audio subsystem and combined it with Tensor A1's multi-path processing. So, basically your music now has a dedicated highway lane on the processor completely independent of the continuous processing needed for the ANC. Pixel Buds Pro 2 delivers significantly longer battery life, even with two times stronger ANC and even though they're smaller than our first generation. In fact, they're the smallest premium earbuds on the market. They're lighter too, the lightest noise-canceling earbuds in the category. We developed the new twist-to-adjust stabilizer, just twist to make them more secure during a workout or relax with them around the house. But Pixel Buds are also the first earbuds with Gemini. With the power of Gemini extensions you can access your email, ask for walking directions, create a YouTube music playlist for your workout, and so much more. Pixel Buds Pro 2 are 229, and we are so excited for you to try them. Our new buds and the Pixel Watch 3 are available for pre-order today. - So, thank you very much for joining us today.

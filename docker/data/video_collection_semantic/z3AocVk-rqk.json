Its the closest approximation to most modern office workers dream workstation. The cheapest configuration costs $4,500, but its a setup weve love to have in our office.

    "transcript": "(upbeat music) - Hey, it's Nick Statt with The Verge here. And we're checking out the Cemtrex Smartdesk. Now this thing has a wild number of features built into it. It's got a wireless charger, it's got touch screen displays motion control, built in wireless headphones. It's a lot going on here so, let's break it all down. (upbeat music) So let's first talk about the displays here. It's got three 24 inch touchscreen displays, but what makes this really cool is that it's got a built in Leap Motion module, right here at the base of the keyboard. That way you can do hands-free gestures. So for instance if you wanna scroll without touching the track pad here, you just move your fingers. And then if you wanna zoom in or zoom out you can use two hands. And they've also got some other gestures too for copy and paste and other things like that. They also have special customized touch screen controls for moving windows around really easily without having to drag and drop. (upbeat music) so it's got a built in keyboard here, and it's a pretty nice keyboard from what I can tell. Other features the desk has built in include this wireless charger over here. It's working with my 10S right now it's a Qi wireless charger. And they've even built in wireless headphones here. If you just slide this out you get your own wireless earbuds. They've worked with a third-party company to develop these in-house actually. I guess the idea here is that you would have these integrated headphones for taking phone calls so you'd never ever need a desk phone. Now if all that wasn't enough, they've even included a built in document scanner. So you have a document here, you can just click \"Get started\", flip it around put it there, and then with one tap you have a document. Now the PC is built in. It's integrated right here under the desk. And while it's a standard PC it's got some pretty nice components. So there's two configurations. Both of the configurations come with an Intel 8th Gen. I7 and 256 gigabytes in a solid-state drive. But if you pay a little bit more money, you go from 16 gigabytes of RAM to 32, you also go from a one terabyte standard hard drive in addition to the solid-state drive to a two terabyte one. And then you also go from a NVIDIA GeForce 10-50 GPU to a 10-60. So in terms of pricing the Smartdesk is not gonna be cheap. Considering all the things they've packed into this device. Now the base model which comes in a matte black finish not this nicer reflective finish you have right here that's gonna cost you 4,500 dollars now if you want the better components, the better GPU, the more RAM, and this better finish on the desk that's gonna cost you 5,700 dollars. Now that is not cheap at all, but Cemtrex considers this more of an enterprise product. So it's not something you would as a consumer buy, it's something if you were running an office if you're an office manager, or you're outfitting a whole floor with new desks, new computers, the whole thing you might consider this for your company. And you might actually consider buying multiple of them. They've actually designed the layout of the desk so that multiple different ones can be configured together. So if you're a company with a lot of money to spend you might actually consider buying this. They're really positioning it as the Smartdesk of the future the future of doing work in an office.

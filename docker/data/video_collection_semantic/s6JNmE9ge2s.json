    "transcript": "now according to a random seller on amazon in this box we have an ak mini gaming pc which if it's anything like the 4k gaming pc i bought off of amazon a while ago it's probably not going to be able to game an 8k but maybe you know we'll find out later in the video but before we do that it's time for a quick word from today's video sponsor that helped pay for uh what what definitely is going to be a functioning 8k gaming system today's video is sponsored by be quiet and their truly badass dark power 12 series of power supplies available in capacities from 750 watts all the way up to an eye-watering thousand five hundred watts with an 80 plus titanium rated efficiency you know it's made from the good stuff my favorite thing about the dark power 12 series of power supplies other than the inclusion of these beautiful nulled thumb screws for easy installation is that they use a 12 pin to dual 8 pins for the vga power cable which means your graphics card is much less likely to overdraw that connector treat yourself to a truly baller power supply using the link in the description below thank you be quiet for sponsoring today's video oh well that's a great start it says gaming pc right on the box so that's like 50 of the advertising already correct now in all fairness to it horrendous marketing aside it does seem like a pretty cool little pc oh it's got a nice little handle oh it's pretty cute now here next to gpu and cpu multiple fans for cooling there's a picture that hints at the definitely an 8k gaming graphics card in here now in the box we get a very serious looking displayport cable we also get what looks like i'm assuming an 8k gaming stand and then we have this hunt key 150 watt power brick and here's our pc oh wow there is a lot of ventilation on this thing which is good for cooling all of that 8k power and then on the front we have the brand name high style histo hysterectomy swiftly moving on on this side we have a power button which sounds okay but i'm pretty sure that's upside down and then we have two usb 2 ports and 2 usb 3 ports now around the back we have some disappointingly basic rear i o for such a powerful gaming system also these two hdmi ports don't actually do anything because the cpu that's supposedly in here doesn't have an igpu in it and then these are the ports for the 8k gaming graphics card in the system which funnily enough as far as i know the actual 8k video output capability of these ports is a bit of a mixed bag but we'll talk more about that once we open up this system and have a closer look at the graphics card inside now i need to figure out how to open it up i actually think it's going to be pretty straightforward it looks like it's just two screws on each side what time it is it's time for david to struggle opening a thing oh okay that's not good i don't know do i just undo screws until something happens is that a good approach oh now it's feeling real loose real loosey-goosey like someone's just gonna pop out now in standard fashion i spent the next 20 odd minutes struggling to open the little bastard up when i finally decided yeah i should probably test it before i break it trying to savage it open okay well we're now in the future i have witnessed the glory that is 8k gaming on a pc the size of a adolescent chinchilla and now if i break it it's not that big a deal now i really want to open the system for a couple of reasons the first one is i am a child and i have to look inside literally everything and then the second reason is i want to do a mild upgrade on this pc so that it can do some real 8k now apparently i prematurely chickened out because it was actually really easy to open up i just missed a couple of screws over the back of the graphics card and then it just kind of popped open so oh oh yeah okay just kind of slide the top off uh and then it opens it up and there we have the inside of our 8k gaming pc now the first thing that stands out to me about this is despite the fact that this is specked with 32 gigs of ram for some reason uh they still just went with a single stick so this is a single 32 gig stick of laptop ram in here uh and then next to that complete abomination we have a pretty decent looking cooler for a low profile system like this now that low profile cooler is cooling an intel i5 9400f which is a several generation old intel cpu at this point and it makes me think this little pc has been sitting in a warehouse for a while and then next to that we have a gtx 1650 a natural choice for an 8k gaming pc now actually in all fairness to the little gtx 1650 it does have a displayport 1.4 port on it which can actually output an 8k 60hz signal although that does not mean it can drive 8k 60hz and the two hdmi ports on there are hdmi 2.0 which top out at 8k 30hz and unfortunately 30 hertz on the best of days leads to a pretty terrible gaming experience and then finally it's got a 250 gig king fast sata ssd in it but anyway with that let's go back to the past fire up the system and see if it's got any bloatware on it does it have vdd no it doesn't this is just a clean windows install good job histo wreck to me now we're going to start off with some reasonable 1080p gaming and then we'll move over to what it was marketed to do 8k now at 1080p high settings gta 5 is running pretty well we're getting about 100 ish frames per second and of course it's a pc report on the internet so there's some cpu or memory bandwidth bottlenecking going on here that's very standard though at this point it would be weirder if that wasn't the case all in all for a system this size it's actually running very well wow the system is definitely audible even with this poultry 1080p battlefield 5 medium setting load that we have here i mean the system's barely being stressed at all although funnily enough gaming in 8k will actually alleviate this cpu slash memory bandwidth bottleneck we've got going on here which just shows this system was clearly designed with a singular purpose in mind anyway with that let's just put an end to the terrible sarcasm and finally throw this little system to the wolves now this is an lg 65 nano 95 a native 8k display for some real 8k gaming and immediately there's a bit of a problem the only video out on this system that can output a 60hz 8k signal is the displayport 1.4 port on the gtx 1650 and considering that this is a tv we only have hdmi inputs which means that with this little system we're going to be limited to 8k 30 hertz which now that's not ideal but you know i guess it is still technically 8k so let's let's give it a try now considering that this is a bonafide 8k gaming pc i am going to leave all of the settings on high because you know it's it's an 8k gaming pc it should be able to handle it come on that's not fun oh never mind all i had to do was turn textures down from high to normal and now gta seems to think it's fine that is some primo 8k gaming right there uh i pressed w quite a while ago and he's only just started moving i feel like maybe leaving everything on high was a bit ambitious so let's quickly change that i mean you know what they say the human eye can't see above one frame per second so honestly we're getting double the performance with realistically need at 8k on a serious note though uh one massive benefit of gaming in 8k is that we don't have a cpu bottleneck anymore so we don't we don't need to worry about changing the memory configuration or anything like that anymore now that i'm in a car it's running a bit better but wow it's so bad look at look at that tearing oh and the input lag i don't know man i feel like even if you were from one of those amazonian tribes that's never encountered western civilization before and this was your first exposure to gaming you probably wouldn't consider this as a playable gaming experience like damn this is so bad at which point i thought it would be a good idea to try some battlefield 5 which went well it can't even register my inputs enough for me to get out of the options oh oh there we go no it has registered it it's just which was followed by another 20 minutes of me wrestling menu screens until i finally had enough okay that's it i'm done my admittedly short attention span has run its course this is clearly going nowhere just alt f4 i then tried cyberpunk which surprisingly went better hey we've actually loaded in now granted we are just getting one frame per second but that is a lot better than battlefield v now before we go through the various upgrades we're gonna do to this system let's just quickly try a game that this system may actually be able to run an 8k well i guess this is the game they used to determine that this is actually an 8k capable gaming pc because here we are gaming in 8k good old half-life 2 runs on literally anything it still feels pretty terrible because we have that 30 hertz limitation of the hdmi 2.0 but we can blame the tv for that because if the tv had a displayport 1.4 connection on it uh we would have been able to game at 60 hertz in 8k so yeah it's the tv's fault it's as easy as that now before we get to our super elegant upgrade that will give us proper 8k gaming performance from this little system i just want to get as much performance out of this form factor as possible and to do that we need to drop an a2000 in here wow that upgrade actually went very smoothly we even happened to have two of the mini display ports line up with the previous i o which is good and hopefully this little dvi porthole has enough girth to manage 70 watts worth of exhaust from this blower style card oh and unfortunately due to the little mini displayport connectors and me not having the correct adapter i'm not going to be able to use this setup with the tv now despite the dual channel ram upgrade the processor in here is still holding back that new graphics card although it's doing much better than i was expecting and we're still getting a lot more performance than we did with the previous graphics card temperature wise it's a different story though that new graphics card doesn't like having to spew all its heat out a little dvi hole now just a quick final note i did also try and use dsr to see how this new graphics card will render 8k uh but for some reason these pro graphics cards have different dsr rendering factors than their gaming counterparts so i couldn't fake 8k on it and in all fairness it's not like the a2000 can 8k so we're gonna have to step it up a notch wow you can hardly tell i've done anything to it why do so many of my videos end up like this now would you look at that all it took was a slight modification to this little system and now we're running gta 5 in 8k high settings with over 80 frames per second now i was about to say that the 3090ti was effortlessly running gta 5 and 8k and then i saw the power draw figure which is that is such a ridiculous number battlefield 5 went from being just a menu hell to running at over 60 frames per second in 8k high settings and in quite the humiliating turn of events it actually seems like the cpu is the bottleneck in the situation now despite the nearly 40-fold performance increase we've gotten with this upgrade even the mighty rtx 3090ti struggles with cyberpunk at 8k low settings this game really is a beast having said that it is definitely playable and then just to quickly summarize my thoughts non-sarcastically for you thickos out there putting the straight up ridiculous marketing aside this little pc is quite cool i like how modular it is and you get a lot of performance for a pc this size however if you take into account that i paid six hundred canadian dollars for this thing that is way too much money for the system and i can't help but think the reason they thought they could get away with that is because they put 8k in the name which brings me to the end of the video thank you very much for watching and until the next video bye-bye you",

    "transcript": "good people say hello to the OnePlus 7 Pro the company's flagship smartphone for 2019 actually I think I should put some asterisks are on that statement because you never know they might actually come out with a OnePlus 7t or the 7t Pro later this year let's just you know what let's just say that the 7 Pro is OnePlus its flagship smartphone to date they brought some interesting additions to this device like the pop-up front-facing camera resulting in this notch list display an additional ultra wide-angle lens a beautiful AMOLED display with a high refresh rate and some more now please don't consider this as a full dedicated review but rather consider it as an informative one so that you're aware of what's really new with the 7 Pro and when we spent a couple of days with this device and I like doing smart reviews more like consumers so you know expect our long term of you in the next few months so here's everything that you need to know about the oneplus 7 pro but first let's take a quick look at our sponsor the lik tech 2 360 air cooler from Animax now comes in this gorgeous white finish to give your PC a bit of character the EF one pump delivers superior cooling performance it's both Intel and AMD socket compatible and it features RGB lighting learn more about it down below alright so I just want to address something right out of the way and that's the size of the 7 Pro it's huge guys in fact it's bigger than the 6t and I was struggling to hold that phone comfortably so if you're in the same boat as I am you're gonna have to get used to this it's a 6 point 6 7 inch AMOLED display that now boasts a resolution of 31 20 by 1440 so quad HD plus instead of the full HD Plus on the 6t so for you pixel geeks out there this is a welcoming bonus oh and the cherry on top of that is that it now features a refresh rate of 90 Hertz so navigating through the UI is a bit more responsive and fluid and if you game a lot on your smart phone this will change everything it's not 120 Hertz as good as the razer phone - but I'll take it over the standard 60 Hertz now I do need to point out that the edges of the display are curved on both sides and honestly I do feel like it's a bit more aggressive than the Galaxy S10 it's more reflective and actually quite distracting and watching content especially in good blinding situations so do keep that in mind but other than that this is a beautiful screen with awesome colors nothing to complain here moving on to the pop-up camera I'm sure a lot of you have questions with regards to the durability because it's a motorized mechanism that pops up and down when you enable the front-facing camera mode now oneplus claims that they've tested this over 300 thousand times to ensure that it's consistent in its operation they've even added rubber grommets around the module to prevent debris from entering and stalling the motors they've also used the accelerometer and the gyroscope to automatically retract the camera module when it's in freefall so for those of you who take selfies in the most extreme conditions like you're on the top of a mountain you're trying to get that cool angle and you're trying to show it off and oops you just drop your phone because a its first of all a huge phone so chances of here dropping it are a lot higher you would have to worry about that anymore because the camera will automatically retract and it will protect the lens module itself so that's nice I mean they're trying everything that they can to make sure that durability is intact and it's certainly something that I have to validate myself in the long-term abuse so do certainly stay tuned for that the one thing that I do want to add on top of this is that oneplus is trying to step out from their comfort zone they're trying something new with the 7 Pro and I gotta give to them because it's certainly not the first phone to come out with this pop-up camera implementation we've seen other brands like Oppo in the Asian markets come out with the same technology but it's a very first device at least in North America to feature this cool implementation and I'm genuinely looking forward to your thoughts about that what do you guys think about it now the design hasn't taken a shift from the 6t aside from the display and the pop-up camera you still get the alert slider which is nice and it comes in three colors mirror Gray almond and nebula blue which is the one that I have over here and I love it quick note on the fit and finish the first thing that I did notice is that this phone is heavy I mean obviously given its sheer size you should expect that I'll do love the frosted sort of matte the back it's certainly a lot better than the glossy surface on the galaxy s10 so it's not a big of a fingerprint magnet compared to that device so that's nice and it gives you a subtle grip so it's certainly nicer to hold my hand but I would probably end up throwing a case on top of this because I do not want to drop this phone I just don't the 7 Pro has a triple camera setup at the back just like the galaxy s10 so you get a 16 megapixel ultra wide-angle lens a 48 megapixel standard lens but before you start jumping with excitement keep in mind that the final image is in 12 megapixels to the pixel binning now for those of you who are wondering what that is it's essentially grouping four by four pixels into one huge pixel that results in better low-light performance lastly there's an 8 megapixel telephoto lens for that extra reach and at first glance the results do look pretty good I mean there is detail the color reproduction is also really nice I don't think you can say anything terrible about the cameras coming out of the stock camera app but having said all that I can't wait to see what Android or third-party developers can come out with especially since the Google camera mod on 6t was a complete game-changer so I can't wait to see that rollout on the 7 Pro it should certainly step things up quite a bit now if you recall watching my OnePlus 6t review I talked about how I had some issues with the in display fingerprint scanner and that's partly because it was first gen tech and it was actually a lot more slower than a physical reader softer blades certainly helped improve the accuracy and the responsiveness but it just wasn't as fast as I'd like it to be now what they've done with the 7 Pro is they've actually increased the size of the scanner by 36% which actually results in a lot more accuracy when it comes to reading your thumbprint or your fingerprint and having spent a couple of days with this device it's noticeably faster than the 6t so that's certainly a welcoming change I mean I can just do a simple tap on this device and I'm automatically on the home screen or into my phone so that's great taking a look at the rest of the specs there's nothing really underwhelming with the 7 pro I mean you get the fastest SOC from Snapdragon coold buying a 10 layer liquid cooling system that I'm really curious to test out since summer is right around the corner here in Canada you also get it to 12 gigabytes of RAM and up to 256 gigabytes storage that now uses the ufs 3.0 standard there's also dual SIM support unfortunately no expandable storage and the battery has been upgraded from 3700 milliamp hours to 4000 and it now supports warped charge 30 this technology was introduced with the oneplus sixty McLennan edition it's a special edition device and what it essentially does is that it charges your device from zero to 50% in just 20 minutes so it's a lot faster than the fast charge method on the standard 60 they've also improved the haptic vibration motor as well as implement dual stereo speakers with support for Dolby Atmos so when you're consuming content there is proper left and right channel separation so that's certainly welcoming change over the 6t now for those of you who embrace wireless charging I'm really sorry to break this to you but the oneplus 7 pro does not support that feature which is really disappointing I was so expecting for them to include that on their next-generation phone but that isn't the case because I'm so spoiled by using or charging my devices wirelessly and now I have to go back to plugging in the cable on this device so yeah it's just it sucks and to be frank having having spoken to oneplus they mentioned that you know they feel like warp charge is the most fastest and efficient way to top-up the battery on the 7 Pro because it's 4,000 milliamp hours and if you try to charge it wirelessly it just takes a lot longer than warp charge and that's kind of their argument for not implement with a faster solution to charge the battery wirelessly they'll certainly look into adding it on the devices but for now it's just not there and to wrap things up there's the software which has always been one of the main pillars of oneplus foundation if you're an existing one plus user you would know what I'm talking about I mean it's clean and super customizable and it constantly gets updated which is awesome there are a couple of features that have been added to the OS namely built-in screen recording which does not have any limits like other third-party apps that you'd have to pay to unlock you can choose your desired resolution and bitrate and I do see myself taking advantage of this feature in the long term the other feature is called Zen mode and I really like this one because you know we're all tied down to our smart in our everyday lives and it's sometimes a distracting factor if you're trying to have a conversation with someone so what does n mode does is that locks you out of the device for 20 minutes straight so you won't be able to access your device like you know checks your social media accounts or just do the things that you're normally able to do I mean you can make emergency phone calls and take pictures but other than that it's launched I think this is a great feature because it helps you focus on other things in life which I personally do value as well so yeah kudos one plus for including that so with all of that out of the way how much does the OnePlus 7 pro cost well it starts at six hundred and seventy dollars and you can obviously configure it all the way up to $750 for the Specht out talking abouts of RAM and doing it 56 kilobytes of storage so certainly not cheap guys and I really want to know thoughts about that in the comments down below do you think it's too expensive or do you think it's a great value for the features that you're getting because personally speaking if I take a step back and look at one plus as a brand they were known for making amazing smart phones for less than $500 they've eaten forms for less than 400 ollars back in the day but now they certainly break the barrier a $600 barrier with the 7 Pro and they're trying to compete with the flagship smartphones out there like the Galaxy S10's and the ones from LG so you could either take it in a positive way or negative way it's certainly a lot cheaper than the Galaxy stem for sure because it's not $1000 and that's great but you know when you look at the phone like the pixel 3a that was just launched last week it basically offers some the core features that you really need on an Android smartphone for $400 so if you're looking for just core functionalities there are other phones for a lot less in the market right now and I think the 7 pro stays somewhere in the middle I certainly have to test it out extensively to give you guys my full thoughts on this device because I could end up running into a lot of issues like I did with the 6t's so who knows we'll see definitely stay tuned for the long term of you I also do want to quickly talk about the oneplus 7 because that is something that a lot of you guys were looking forward to as well now think of it this way the 7 is just an incremental upgrade over the 60 you're just getting updated specs in terms of your SOC your storage capacity is now operated from when one 23.0 standard and that's pretty much it now from what I've been told the one plus seven is only available to buy in select countries so in the United States I think it's just gonna be the 6t and the 7 Pro which are the two product stack up for the rest of 2019 so I hope you learned everything about the 1 plus 7 Pro if you're interested in anything particular that you wanted me to test on this device definitely let me know the comments down below and I'll make sure to include them in my long term review I meet with hundred connects thank you so much for watching stay tuned for more smartphone content because it's gonna get too hot I'm signing off and I'll see you guys in the next one",

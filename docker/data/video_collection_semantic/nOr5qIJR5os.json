    "transcript": "in today's video I'm going to have a look at the newest in a long line of nvidia's noob beter 9000s and funnily enough I was actually baited by this graphics card the other day I was shopping for graphics cards and noticed some RTX 3050s selling for $220 Canadian dollar which seemed like a great deal to me I was legitimately really excited to see that but then I noticed that it just has 6 gigs of video memory which was not the amount I remembered the have it so I Googled it and realized that it's not an RTX 3050 if anything it's an RTX 3040 so in today's video I'm going to see how slow this thing actually is and to What depths the RTX name plate has plunged but first today's video is sponsored by boot dodev a great way for even a complete Noob To Learn backend web development in both Python and go programming languages and with boot. dev's focus on the gamification of learning not only is the process very engaging but it also gets you to write a ton of actual code nothing like some practical learning and for those of you that feel like you need a community for learning boot. deev has a very active Discord Community with a bunch of people willing to help if you ever get stuck on particular problems and there are even community events like bimonthly boss battles where the community rallies together and gets bonus XP for every lesson they complete so if you want to learn some valuable programming skills check out boot. Dev with the link down below and use code do it for 25% off your first month or even first year if you choose annual [Music] billing now I'm always excited about a new budget graphics card but this 6 gig RTX 3050 is pretty much a masterclass in how to turn something exciting into something that's a family ruining traumatic experience this is kind of like giving your kid socks on Christmas it's outrageous because not only does your video memory drop from 8 gigs to 6 gigs with a smaller memory bus but the GPU in here is also cut down quite significantly it's cut down so significantly in fact that Nvidia thought it was appropriate for them to call the GPU something different the GPU die in the 8 gig variant of the RTX 3050 is called the ga 106 whereas in the 6 gig variant of the 3050 it's called the ga 107 yeah I mean here's a handy rule of thumb for you inidia if you feel like the GPU die warrants a different name the graphics card warrants a different name it's not really difficult like if they just called it the RTX 3040 it would have been a lot more exciting cuz on the surface it's got some stuff going for it it's droing TDP for example means that it doesn't need supplemental power so low profile versions of these gpus are much more versatile than its more power hungry Brothers but anyway let's put my disgruntled ramblings aside and drop this graphics card into a system to see what kind of performance we get out of it and how it compares to its bigger brother now in terms of the system I'm testing it in I've got a ryzen 9 5900 X in there with 16 gigs of ddr4 running at 3600 MHz so with that let's see how it performs damn I thought these gaming X cards were like good versions of gpus but this is one step of building build quality away from just being a scam wish graphics card oh I love the little Stoppers that keep the back plate from overbending and they're not screwed down look at that Stellar build quality aside the RTX 3040 and I'm going to call it that from now on cuz it's much less stupid in a vacuum performs pretty well this is CS2 running a 1080p low settings and for an Esports title like this it's very usable I mean look at that it's well over 300 frames per second and because of its low power draw despite the janky cooler the temperatures are very good on the card and it's pretty quiet moving over to Doom Eternal at 1080p High settings again a very respectable result here even if you have a higher refresh rate display this will cut it and despite the more consistent higher load on the GPU the temperatures didn't bad ey however with a more demanding game like cyberpunk aenp medium settings it really starts to struggle consistently staying below 60 frames per second now considering the that the 3040 is an RTX GPU we get access to some dlss action and interestingly in cyberpunk When comparing dlss and Fidelity FX at the same settings not only did dlss visually look a bit better even if it wasn't a huge difference dlss looked a bit less fuzzy but I even got a higher frame rate which I wasn't expecting this is something I'll test in more detail later in the video but first let's get the base performance comparison out of the way but either way even without upscaling at 1080p the 3040 does a reasonable job at gaming although when it comes to more demanding modern games like the last of us at 1080p medium it starts to struggle a little the game felt all molassy but how does it compare to the graphics card which name it stole a direct comparison to the real RTX 350 is not flattering it starts off with a reasonably gentle comparison in Counter Strike where we're seeing about a 10ish per performance difference it is worth noting that in Counter Strike 2 the 3040 uses proportionately quite a bit less power so there's a reasonable bit of efficiency on show here but as the games start asking more of the graphics cards the Gap keeps getting bigger with doom Eternal not only is the average performance quite a bit better we see a reasonable jump in 1% lows which makes it feel a lot smoother and with cyberpunk is the first time we see that performance difference taking the gaming experience from feeling a bit theic to being perfectly playable so depending on the game there really is a name change worthy performance Delta between these two graphics cards and when comparing the RTX 3040 to a similarly priced is AMD graphics card the RX 6500 XT the comparison becomes more favorable but that card was pretty bot cheeks when it came out only has 4 gigs of video memory and doesn't have a video encoder so you can't screen capture footage with it oh and it also wildly soiled its diapers and doom maternal for some reason but despite being more lethargic than its bigger brother it still isn't the slowest RTX graphics card that achievement still lies squarely in the hands of of the laptop RTX 2050 which is still a whole lot more rubbish than our new little RTX 3040 so now that we've confirm this is a genuine case of stolen identity let's Circle back around and see if dlss is a feature that makes this graphics card a decent bit more exciting or if the cyberpunk situation was a fluke I thought it would be interesting to start off with some Ratchet and Clank which here looks very weird like what's up with his face what's going on here but either way at 1080p medium settings we're getting about 60 frames per second here now let's see what happens when we turn on the lowest settings available for rate racing and straight off the bat we've lost half our frame rate which very much tracks for rate tracing that's often what happens the game still looks very weird I guess things are more bloomy and kind of bright if anything it's it's just blinding me now next let's crank dim rate racing settings and surprisingly that's had a much less dramatic impact on the performance and I don't know visually it looks so similar to me anyway let's see to what extent dlss can save us here let's do balanced wait a minute dlss just fixed all that visual weirdness if anything it made a bigger Improvement to the visuals than turning on rate racing did I guess it's cuz we're running 1080p on a 1440p display but either way we've also gotten more performance so win-win all round let's see what happens when we jump to Performance yeah I don't know it doesn't look that much worse even the streamers and stuff like particle effects are being handled decently although we're not getting that much more performance but anyway either way let's compare it to FSR so we'll switch over to FSR 3 with performance W the quality difference is pretty big with FSR you lose some of the particle effects like the streamers and stuff in the upscaling process which doesn't happen with dlss and when there's a bunch of movement like around this flag there's a lot more artifacting happening with FSR ooh that's fascinating considering that this is a PS5 game but at least there isn't a performance difference between the two and luckily Ratchet and Clank also has Intel's upscaling so let's give that a try whoa I mean clearly Intel is drunk or summon because oh it just fixed itself okay that was just a bit of a seizure but it's over now but now that it's it's woken up from its drunken stuper so Intel seems to be like a middle ground between the two when you're looking at a static shot it looks similar to dlss but when you start moving around everything kind of blurs in the way that it does with FSR but with that let's try one more game to see if this is a trend now the final game I want to play around with is the last of us because recently I figured out that it's got a pretty good dlss implementation now here it's running at the same settings I used for the testing before so this is 1080p medium and we're actually running at 1080p here and 40 frames per second it's it's not doing amazingly now one of the cool things about the last of us is it show shows you what the rendered resolution is so with balanced dlss it drops from 1080p to 1120x 632 and in terms of performance that gives us a lot more so we've gone from about 40 to about 60 and the game feels way better and again like despite this being what looks like quite a difficult scene to upscale I don't think I can tell dlss is on it looks really good I wonder if it's the same for Fidelity FX it is I I don't think I can see the difference it looks so similar which I mean that's a tie right if it performs the same and it looks the same it's functionally the same interestingly balanced on the two uses a slightly different resolution so next we're going to go more aggressive with it so we're going to drop it from Balan down to Performance oh it still looks so similar to me now in zoomed in on the screenshots it looks a bit fuzzy in performance but I still can't tell the difference between FSR and dlss here and in game they both look and feel very good although the cracks are starting to show with things like that fence wobbling in the distance and just some general upscaling artifacts oh interestingly dlss only goes down to Performance in this game so if you really want to wreck your image quality you have to go back over to FSR and then I want to go all in so we're going to turn frame generation on as well oh it's starting to look rubbish now and it's starting to feel pretty heavy but we've got a lot of frame rate so let's crack the normal settings which it's super not happy about in terms of that oh the mush is coming and oh look at that line look at that uh and aside from that there's also a decent amount of input lag oh so the only way we can make it look worse now is by dropping the display resolution which does some wild things to the rendered resolution okay now don't get me wrong it looks like my cat threw up this video game on the display but considering what's happening here we've got a 1440p display and the resolution is like 3x4 it could have been a hell of a lot worse it really isn't that bad so with that whether or not the new beta 9000 gives you cheap access to dlss as a selling point or not I guess depends very much on the game you're playing so with that thank you for watching subscribe and watch another video suggestion will pop up in a second and until the next one bye-bye [Music] w [Music]",

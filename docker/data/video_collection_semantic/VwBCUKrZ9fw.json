    "transcript": "well guys this is our very first product showcase of CES and it comes from Razer was likely showing us some of the coolest stuff at the show this year unlike other years the products will be taking a look at today will be available this year rather than just being a proof-of-concept like last year's crazy triple screen gaming notebook the first thing that popped out at the razor suite was this say hello to the Razer Raptor a monitor that has been designed to provide the ultimate gaming experience or more like the ultimate Razer gaming experience now I know some of you might be thinking oh no another gaming monitor but there's something really exciting about this particular one that I'll get to in a minute but before that I'd like to thank our show sponsors Razer Phanteks MSI thermaltake and Corsair because without them this coverage would not have been possible okay so back to the Raptor the first thing that I wanted to mention is that this isn't a final production sample but rather an early design face model we will see the Raptor on sale a bit later this year and I wouldn't be surprised if the final version is unveiled at Computex so this is a 27-inch monitor that's the first razor has designed and produced from ground up they've also collaborated with other manufacturers to rebrand monitors but this one is completely different now usually I'll be talking about panel specs right now but that'll wait till later because what caught our eyes is the exterior design I think Razer is one of the first companies to really think about the monitors cable management and back panel design and it's actually pretty brilliant while the overall design looks a lot like an iMac the back plate has this cool blend of brushed matte black metal and this black fabric material which looks pretty cool not only that but the base is made out of forced aluminum and five CNC mill channels that are used for easy cable management the solution is absolutely brilliant especially when you use the green razor cables that are included when you buy the Raptor personally and I love the fact that Razer went with this level to ensure cable clutter is out of the way and it properly managed of course there's also subtle integrated chroma RGB lining that can be controlled through the snaps three application and will color coordinate with the other you know Razer peripherals even though the base doesn't swivel the raptor has full height adjustment along with this little trick so the entire panel can pivot 90 degrees for super easy access to the i/o ports I think this is just pure genius the other thing that really jumped out is just how thin the rafters bezels are and only 2.3 millimeters if you can afford three of them it would make a perfect multi-monitor setup all right so now on to the specs and they're pretty much on par with what you would expect on a gaming monitor these days the raptor has a 1440p IPS panel that's rated at 144 Hertz and incorporates freesync and HDR it also has a one millisecond response time if the special motion blur reduction is used but without that it enables or rewards to a typical seven millisecond or four millisecond with overdrive enabled according to razor they'll be factory calibrating every Raptor to deliver optimal color and gaming performance right out of the box ask for input connectors it's pretty decent with hdmi 2.0 a DisplayPort 1.4 connector a USB C and two USB 3.0 pass reports that USB C supports the DisplayPort 1.4 protocol and can act as a power delivery port to charge your mobile device Razer has also implemented true picture in picture and picture by picture modes which can allow images from multiple inputs that can be displayed at the same time this would be great for productivity but I think it will be a more useful feature on larger format displays rather than just 27 inches now at this point I'm sure you're all wondering about the price since this is a pretty high-end display and it's from Razer so I'm just gonna come out and say it the Raptor will go for around $700 us and will be available in the US and Canada later now that's a pretty big chunk of money when you consider the competition and the fact that it doesn't even have g-sync but there are still some awesome features here so what do you guys think about the Razer Raptor does it deliver what you want from a 20-19 gaming display and more importantly do you think it's too expensive let us know in the comments down below and make sure to subscribe for more content from this madness that's at CES I'm Eber with Hardware Canucks thank you so much watching and we'll see you in the next one",

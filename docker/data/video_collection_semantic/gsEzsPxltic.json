    "transcript": "- Hello, and welcome to This Is. PlayStation is making a car and you can't drive it. - So here's the thing. Sony has been talking about this for a couple of years. In fact, the last CES we went to in person, CES 2020, they showed off a concept. And again, this year in CES 2022, they got serious. The Sony Vision S02. So this is a concept electric SUV that has been shown off. This is a real functioning prototype with a PS5 in the back. Asterisk right now is only able to do remote play. However, there's a whole bunch to the story. I think it's actually legitimately really interesting. - Let's collect the facts. - Fact me. - So there is the Vision S01, which was the car that they showed off in CES 2020. Think of that as the Model 3, Model S. So they showed off that vehicle. They're like, no, we're not gonna make this thing. So in 2022, they've announced the Vision S02, which is a SUV. Think of that as the Model Y. This is one they actually wanna make. - [Man 1] It's like the very Porsche Design. Where it's got the front screen across the entire-- - [Matt] The dash. - [Man 1] Dash. But then in the back, they have two screens, which supposedly can play PS5 games. The asterisk there is, it only does remote play to your console back home. - [Man 1] For now. However, if you look at what our good buddy, the new ruler of Twitter, Elon Musk, is doing in the Model S and in the Model X. He has actually already put in, essentially the same or very similar chip to what is inside the PS5. And that is running the infotainment system and that also enables the games, which he's shown off a bunch of stuff like Cyberpunk and whatnot. And he's even talking about trying to get full steam running on your Tesla. - [Matt] None of them have actually come into a Tesla. - [Man 1] Well- - I mean, something that was promised for Tesla that hasn't yet arrived. I am shocked and appalled. - I'd like to apologize to all the Tesla fan boys who just disliked this video, but please subscribe to, subscribe to this is, I'm sorry for punching my microphone. - Oh my God. - I got a little excited. I had so much BOSS Coffee, Matt, that I'm a little- - You getting all antsy in your panties right now with that BOSS Coffee over there. You know what doesn't give you antsy in your panties is Red Bull, it gives you wings. - The fun thing is we're not sponsored by these companies, but Matt and I are just in a competing ward to try to get a sponsorship at some point. Oh, so delicious, Matt. Suntory BOSS Coffee. Suntory make excellent whiskey as well. - Gonna tape your mouth shut - High quality Japanese brand, local liquor. - I'm gonna throw you, I'm gonna pick you up and throw you. (beep) - It absolutely makes sense for Sony. If they are going to ship this vehicle, which currently they're planning on shipping in 2025 with some help by Honda, which we'll get into in a second. - [Matt] Yes. - There's no reason why they couldn't actually implement something very similar to what Tesla's doing. Because in the current model S and in the current model X in addition to the large front display, there's also a rear display where the kiddos can be back there playing some Cyberpunk or whatever, via the little display in the same PS5 grade chip, right? This is something that makes sense inside of a vehicle. And Sony are absolutely the ones who should load a PS5 up in their I'm sure, very expensive electric car. There are a lot of reasons why this makes sense. - I'm gonna poke some holes in this. - No, it's fine. - The first hole is, there's multiple screens. PlayStation 5 is not powerful enough to run multiple PlayStation 5 games. A lot of times, PlayStation 5 is not powerful enough to play PlayStation 5 games. If this is also running the infotainment system in the front, it's driving a lot in this vehicle. - I think you're way overthinking this. - No, no, no, no, no. - You already can't buy a PS5. Load seven PS5's up in the Sony car. I'm sure it'll be fine. Or you could just put one in there and ignore- - We can't even get seven PS5's to come to our local best buy. The parts aren't there for this. - But this is coming out in 2025, Matt. - Yeah. - You think there'll be a chip shortage in 2025. World peace will be achieved by then. (Matt laughs) - [Matt] He said there wouldn't be a chip shortage in 2025. - Here's the thing though. This makes sense. Sony could, and I think absolutely should, give you a full PS5 worth of infotainment capability inside the Sony car. Because the other part of this that seems to be not only even rumored, this is really something that they ever already announced. Sony's going to be working with Honda to make this vehicle happen. Now Honda, is a company which has a long and great history of making vehicles. However, they haven't really leaned into EVs that much. In fact, Honda's already also announced a partnership with GM. So there's a lot of partnerships going on, but if they want to take advantage of some Sony technology, some Sony design, some Sony PS5 action to give their cars some extra selling points. Because if you think about it, right? When you get into an electric car, there's a little bit less differentiation among vehicles than you might have in a normal car. Generally speaking, all electric cars are pretty punchy. They all have decent range, but what you can do is you can differentiate them with the interior features. With the infotainment, with the performance and the capabilities of that, right? Especially as driving becomes less and less important for most people who are just trying to get from A to B. Guess what? Once your car is self-driving itself, 90% of the way on the freeway, you're gonna be wanting to play on your giant screens. You wanna play Madden 2027 on your Sony Honda Etron device thing. I think this makes a lot of sense, especially, because again, it's not like some crazy wild thing. Just already has this, there's a piece of the PS5 already built then. - I don't think this makes sense today, but it does make sense a few years down the road, when we actually have some better self-driving. It's clear that we're not ready for this yet, as of right now. But couple things we don't know is whether this is actually gonna be a Sony car. That's manufactured by Honda. Whether it's gonna be a Honda car, that's the Honda PlayStation, which would be really dumb. Sony's not gonna ramp up and build a car factory. - Maybe. But the thing is, you can imagine Sony batteries, Sony electronics, Sony PS5 kind of built in. There's a reason why companies like this work together. But I think it's really interesting to think about the idea of cars really becoming tech. You look at what Tesla's done. You look at what they're already doing right now today shipping vehicles. They basically have PS5 built in. I think that there's real utility to be able to play your favorite games. This is a really cool and interesting idea. Now, as far as the Sony car itself, I have some doubts. - I don't think that Sony's gonna be branded on this. in any way, shape or form, at the end of the day. It's gonna be a Honda car that is just Sony tech inside. - Or it's the Sony car versus the Apple car. I just saying that sounds like- - We know that Apple keep saying, \"No, we're not making an Apple car.\" And then they keep hiring people for a car division. So we know it's in the works. - [Man 1] Yeah. - If I was to compare Apple to Sony on this one, I see Apple making an Apple car way more than I see Sony making a Sony car. You know, who, a tech company, who actually to me makes the most sense to build their own car is Samsung. People forget that Samsung makes tanks, and- - Do you think Samsung can make a folding car? - The Samsung Z flip fold car four wheel drive. Eventually tech companies are gonna start expanding out, because they realize they can only make so much money on phones, they can only make so much money on computer screens or whatever. Because everyone has one. You gotta break into new frontiers to get into new market. - [Man 1] Absolutely. - Samsung actually has facilities that I think could be converted to making vehicles fairly easy, compared to ramping up production from scratch from something like Apple or Sony. - So, if you think about the car space, right now it is going through an enormous shift. Basically, you have on one side \"legacy automakers\" that are already been making cars for years and years, are quickly shifting their lineups over to electric, as fast as they can, right? Everyone's trying to grab batteries and everything like that. On the other side, you have these startups, right? So obviously led by Tesla, but you have other new companies, such as Rivian such as Lucid. There are a lot of companies who are coming up, who are needing enormous piles of cash, which makes sense, 'cause making cars is not cheap. That's a huge endeavor. And then you've got these interested parties like Apple, Sony, Samsung or whoever, who are like, \"You know what? This could be an enormous business.\" I'm curious, Matt, do you think Sony should sink tens of billions of dollars into making a car instead of just buying more studios like Bungee? To me it's like one of those things where it kind of makes sense to me if Sony wants to create this technology to create a PS5 chip, that can run PS5 games and a bunch of the automotive tech that could go to a Honda or something. That makes sense but, do you think that they should be actually making a car? - They have a track record of doing exactly what I think they're gonna do. You look at the CD attachment for PlayStation, for Nintendo I'm blanking on- - You can sound like you need a little pick me up and with their high quality flash blue brew blend and already filled with milk and sugar, it's quite delicious, they'll give you a little pick me up so that you don't say the wrong thing on This Is episode. Mm. (beep) - What they did is, they work with companies. They supply some parts, they do some development for them. And then they take what they learn from that. And that's when they move into it. I mean, Sony is just such a massive company. So many people forget that they're like, \"Oh, it's just PlayStation. Or it's just some movie.\" No, we're using all Sony cameras right now. They have markets all over the place, for different things. It's kind of like with Microsoft too, they don't have to say, \"Okay, this one division is gonna spend all our money on this thing.\" They could say, \"Okay, well we're buying Bungee, and now we're gonna invest more into movie studios and TV studios.\" And if that starts to take off all those profits then can be put into another new venture, which could be cars. - A lot of what makes an electric car interesting, isn't actually the car itself, it's the software. And it's the experience that you've developed around it, right? - Which is where I'm gonna say. Sony has probably some of the worst software across the board. I know some people love it. I cannot stand the PS5 software. I think it's designed too much by engineers and not enough by an experienced developer. And I think that's just Sony across the board. - It's a matter of, does Sony have the right idea to get into the car space? Obviously, it's something that they're incredibly excited for and something that they've been talking about for a number of years. They're making prototypes, they're making partnerships. It's clear that they want to do this. That being said, I agree with you. I don't think Sony will sell the cars. I think Sony will create the tech. They'll have the PlayStation in it. They'll have a bunch of software. They'll have a bunch of self-driving tech and whatnot in a car. I just don't think this actually is ever going to hit the actual streets as a Sony branded car. - No. - But let us know what you think in the comments below. Make sure to of course, subscribe, ringling the dingling button. Let us know how many NOOBS you'd own in your PS5 car. And until next time I'm going to drink a delicious BOSS Coffee and thank you to BOSS Coffee for future sponsoring us, hopefully. - Ah, team Red Bull. (soft music)",

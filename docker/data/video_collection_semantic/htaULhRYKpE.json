    "description": "Honor 8 Giveaway CLICK HERE ---:  Giveaway ends: January 18 2017 Giveaway is not associated with Huawei or YouTube in any way.  How durable is the new Honor 8 from Huawei? Will it last the full standard smartphone lifespan of 2 years? My durability tests are here to help us find out.  I put the Honor 8 through 2 years worth of abuse in just a few minutes.   Ill start by unboxing the Honor 8, and then begin with a scratch test. After that Ill see what other materials make up the phone body, and finish off with the flame and bend tests.  Let me know if you have any questions, and tell me what phone you want to see me test next!

    "transcript": "The Honor 8. Ive tested quite a few Huawei phones on my channel and most have survived the durability test, even if only barely. Huawei has never been a contender for the most durable cell phone award. In fact, the Nexus 6P was one of the very first phones on my Shelf of Shame back in 2015. Interestingly enough its smashed sideways in the box like a juke box coin slot. Now that its out its time to see how this newcomer holds up. Ill be announcing a phone giveaway at the end of this video so stick around. Lets get started. [Intro] The back glass of this phone is absolutely incredible. The reflections are not uniform which gives off an extremely psychedelic 3D kind of vibe. If youre the type of person who rolls around without a protective skin or case, this phone is going to turn some heads. Its heavy too, which I really like. And the glass has a cold quality premium feel to it. Speaking of glass, its time for the scratch test. As always my Mohs picks tell me where the hardness of the screen falls. Plastic scratches at a 3, glass scratches at a 5 or a 6, and real sapphire will scratch at an 8 or a 9. On their website, Huawei advertises that the glass is a thick piece of 2.5D glass, which means that it has a slight curve along the edge. Most smart phones scratch at a level 6, but this phone scratches at a level 5. This phone is using Gorilla Glass 3 which is definitely an older version of the glass that might not have the same hardness properties as Gorilla Glass 4 or 5. This set of Mohs picks that Im using have never been sharpened, so there is zero chance of contamination on the tips. And this set has been used on previous phones as well. So any contamination would have manifest itself before now. One further test against contamination is using my razor blade on the front glass. My razor, which should be about a level 5 or 5 and a half on Mohs scale, can damage the glass as you can see in this video. Which means that the glass is softer than a level 6. Slightly softer glass on a smart phone screen is not a deal breaker. It is a relatively small problem that can be easily fixed by simply installing a screen protector. The earpiece of this phone is metal, which is infinitely more durable than the earpiece stickers we saw on the Blackberry Detect 50, or the strange cloth speaker we saw covering the Google Pixel. So thumbs up to Huawei for using metal. Now the back glass of the phone is interesting. Apparently the glass is made up of 15 different layers, which makes it incredibly trippy to look at. Light is being reflected in directions that seem to disobey the laws of physics. I tried scratching with my level 5 pick and nothing happened. Only my level 6 pick would leave a mark. So theres less to worry about here on the back as far as scratching is concerned. This is really good news for the dual 12 megapixel camera lenses up at the top since they are also protected by this same piece of glass. My razor blade is unable to leave any marks on the flush surface. The rear fingerprint scanner on the other hand feels more like a smooth rubber coated plastic. It doesnt scratch as easy as the Galaxy S7 fingerprint scanner, but it can still be scratched. Unlike the ceramic Home button on the Mi Mix. Even though the fingerprint scanner has been heavily abused, it still functions at 100 percent. There is some kind of metaphor for life in there somewhere Im sure, but either way, my fingerprint gets red every single time I try and thats a good thing. The sides of the phone have a refreshing metal on metal sound to them. Even the Power button and Volume rocker are made of metal. We can meander down to the USB charging port and the headphone jack and we find even more cold hard metal. Premium materials do cover every single surface on this phone. Lets take a look at the screen. Fire gives us the answer as to what type of screen it is. An LCD display will turn black and then completely recover, where an AMOLED screen will turn white and usually not recover from flame. So this screen is obviously an LCD; similar to what the iPhone has. The Honor 8 lasted about 11 seconds before going black and then recovering. If you havent subscribed yet, make sure you do. Its time for the bend test and you would think that since the phone is made entirely out of thick glass and metal that it would be super rigid, but it does have a little bit of a flex to it. If youve watched any of my other videos, I do not go easy on any phone. And now this phone has a slight S shape to it. Even when bent back from the other direction, it flexes a bit but it still does not snap in half. Its not quite the same rigidness of a Samsung phone, but this glass and metal Huawei device is also about half the price, and its still definitely not ever going to snap in half like the older Nexus 6P. After bending it I was able to straighten it out completely. And look its like nothing ever happened. Overall I am very impressed with this phone; price and everything. Even the color is super awesome. Id love to see all the colors side by side. Thank you so much for watching. I do really appreciate it. And because this phone did so well on the durability test, I will be giving away a brand new phone, not this one, a brand new phone, in the gleam link right below this video. Its a link that you can click on and its makes sure that you are following me on Twitter and Instagram and subscribed here on YouTube. Each one of those things gets you an entry into the giveaway. So you have 3 chances of winning. The contest is international and it will end one week from today. And remember that its completely random. So telling me that your cat has cancer will not improve your chances of winning. Thanks for watching! Ill see you around.",

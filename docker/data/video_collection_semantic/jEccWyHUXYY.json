    "transcript": "- So I've gotten into some controversy. This is not a video that I wanted to make. In fact, I've actually put off making this video for a few days because I was hoping that things would just kind of blow over. But it's just escalated, right? Like I've been doxed, it's sort of crossing some lines that I'm just not comfortable with. And it's all over a video game console. So if you're landing on this video and you're like, \"Austin, why so serious? What happened?\" I made a video this weekend, on Saturday specifically, talking about the brand new updated model of the PS5. The title was The New PS5 Is Worse. And let's just say, the internet has not been super pleased with some of the things I did and said in that video. Okay, so let me run through the idea for what happened there, because it was fairly straightforward. So a couple months ago, Sony announced, or they didn't even announce, there was like a leak liked regulatory filing or something, there was an updated version of the PS5 and the only real thing that looked significantly different was the weight. It was about 300 grams or a little over half a pound lighter. I saw it as kind of vaguely interesting, especially 'cause they didn't really say what was different. And you know, Sony has a little bit of a track record for sort of dumbing down their consoles and kind of cost reducing them over time, which is fair enough. But there was no sort of word on anything like that. Fast forward to a little over a week ago and these things had actually started to hit the market. So they were starting to hit in like Japan and Australia. And so I was directly talking with someone in Japan who had gotten their hands on one of these units, paid a lot of money to have it shipped here, so I could take a look. It's not like a PS5 Slim or anything like that, but I was kind of going under this assumption that if there was such a big weight difference that there would be some significant internal change, right? I mean a half a pound, that's a lot of something that is missing out of the PS5. So I bought it, got into the studio and immediately started shooting the video on what was different. So if you've seen that video, you know that I go through and test a bunch of stuff with it and blah, blah, blah. But the culmination really was when I actually cracked it open and saw that they have massively reduced the size of the heat sink. And so I posted the video, sharing my findings, sharing my opinions on it. And boy, I was not ready for just how upset, I think people are. So yeah, let's break it down. What I saw was that the new PS5 runs hotter and with the thermal images that I was able to take, plus the fact that I tore open the PS5 and saw that Sony has significantly reduced the size of the heat sink. Putting two and two together, I determined that it is a downgrade compared to the first model. Now, a lot of people have taken issue with that. Some people have said that, oh, maybe it's more like thermally efficient, for example. But my argument there would be that just doesn't square with laws of physics. Now, if I had opened up the PS5 and it was a very different array of like the heat sink and the fins and the heat pipes and everything. If they had like extra air channels or a bigger fan or whatever the case is, and to be fair, the fan was slightly different, although it probably wasn't enough to make a massive difference. Certainly, I don't think enough to completely overhaul the amount of sort of cooling that they've removed with the actual heat sink. Then sure. But that's not the case. The PS5, it just simply has a smaller heat sink. There's less aluminum, there's less copper, there's less material, there's 300 grams less. And the laws of physics pretty simply dictate that there's less material and less surface area to remove that heat off of the chip. Now, can I tell you with 1000% certainty that the chip, which is really the most important thing on the inside, that the actual SoC is running hotter than the original model? No, without being Sony, I cannot tell you exactly what that is. But using some, what I would consider to be common sense, that the cooling apparatus is far smaller and therefore, the temperatures I'm seeing that are coming out of the system are significantly higher. I feel pretty confident in the fact that the new PS5 simply does not run as cool as the original. My thought on why the new PS5 has been changed, is economics. So the PS5, I think, is significantly quieter than earlier PS4s, right? I think Sony's had issues in the past with consoles that were too loud, especially if you had like one of those early PS4 Pros. And my thought would be is that when they were developing the PS5, they maybe didn't know exactly how much power they had to run through the chip, they didn't know exactly what the whole cooling apparatus would be, they didn't know what kind of yields they were gonna get from TSMC, all this kind of stuff. So my assumption is, is they over-engineered the cooling beyond what they really needed and then they shipped it because, oh, okay, it was fine. However, with the various chip shortages and the price of raw materials and ultimately with a lot more data than they had when they made this decision two years ago or whatever, my thought would be that Sony has probably looked at the PS5 and go, \"You know what? We actually slightly over-engineered the cooling to hit our specs, whether it would be on the clock speed or the longevity or whatever.\" And so to save money, they have trimmed back on the material, which not only saves in the actual copper and aluminum they have to purchase, but also in like shipping costs of a pallet of PS5s that each weigh half a pound less, that adds up. Now, what's kind of unfortunate about this, in addition to all of the anger on the fanboy side of things, is in fact, that scalpers have really piled onto this video and now they're selling the first models of the PS5 for significantly more than they were before the video. That's stupid. Look, if you have the new and the old PS5 in front of me and asked me to pick one, I would pick the old one. \"But you'll have to pay more for it.\" Five bucks. Look, it is a small difference. It's a difference, and it's a difference that I was happy to highlight, but it is nowhere near the thing that it has been sort of been made out to be. When the video first went live, there were a few people like, \"Oh, I don't know, blah, blah, blah, whatever.\" But over the last few days, I mean, my Twitter has been absolutely unusable. People like, \"(beep) you.\" \"Microsoft paid you.\" Or like, \"Oh, you're wrong.\" Or the amount of videos people have made. And look, I'm not gonna hate on you for jumping on a trend and making the stuff. But the amount of like. \"Austin Evans is a liar.\" \"The PS5 is no different.\" Or, \"Oh, I think that the thermal material they took out there's completely useless.\" And all this kind of stuff. But what's kind of happened is that a lot of the things I said in that initial video, they were written up on like lots of articles and websites and all over like Reddit and stuff. And then people then quoted that and then made videos on like intercutting me talking about the PlayStation, the Xbox. And in ways, it's gotten to a ridiculous sort of degree really quickly. I've been making videos for 12 years on tech. I've done a lot of videos on controversial subjects, but the level of just toxicity that I've seen with this conversation, is orders of magnitude higher than anything I've ever seen. Look, there's a lot of reasons I think, behind that. But ultimately, it's hard because if you look at someone like Digital Foundry, who I have a ton of respect for, and they were the only people who've actually, instead of just commenting on this thing, actually they've got one of these PS5s, right, they went out and bought one of the new PS5s. And in their testing, well, I don't believe they've done the thermal testing, they determined that it has probably about the same power as the original PS5 and that you're getting about the same performance, which is well worth a read. People keep sending it to me as if it's like the Exposed Austin Evans is Wrong article. I 100% agree with every single word in that article, right? At no point have I said that the PS5 is losing performance or anything like that. All I have said is that based on my own testing, it seems to be running hotter, which would logically make sense with a smaller heat sink. And therefore, you could have some issues down the line. If you're in a really thermally constrained environment, you're in a TV cabinet or something, your PS5 may run hotter, it may have less longevity. But that's all I've said. However, the discourse has quickly turned into I hate the PS5 and I'm this clickbait YouTuber who doesn't know what he's talking about and is just trying to get views. (Austin grunting) Thumbnails and titles are incredibly important on YouTube. And some people have taken issue with what the title and thumbnail I used for the PS5 video. Fair enough. Fair criticism. What I would say to that is, at least for the title, I do think the PS5 is worse. Is there a more accurate version of the title, which, I think the new PS5 is very slightly worse because I opened it up? Yeah, sure. Maybe that's a slightly more accurate title. But ultimately, I think the message of my thoughts on the PS5 were accurately portrayed by that title, hasn't been changed, won't be changed. On the thumbnail, which I think is probably where people got a little bit more salty. Yeah. So this is the thumbnail of my PS5 video. And yes, it has been Photoshopped, that's not exactly what the PS5 looks like. But here's the thing, right. The way that the YouTube algorithm works is that if a video does not get a click, it is buried, right. It is very simple. If you don't get the click on the video, YouTube will not push it out, it will not get impressions, it will not get views, you're wasting your time, right? Now if I had made a PS5 on fire, which sure yeah, we've done some silly thumbnails in the past, absolutely. But this to me, I guess at least, and maybe I'm wrong and maybe this is where your opinion differs, I don't think this is a crazy clickbait thumbnail. In fact, actually the original version of this thumbnail before it went live was actually of the proper two PS5s side by side. The problem is, is that most people look at a thumbnail for about a half a second, you're scrolling through. If I show you this thumbnail, pff, oh, there it went. Were you able to see it? Were you able to kind of tell the difference? No, probably not. Because, well, yes when you look at it in person, when you're actually watching the video, the difference in the heat sinks is pretty noticeable. But on a tiny little thumbnail that flies across the screen, it's simply not something that you'll see. The other thing that has been everywhere, is how I'm a paid Microsoft shill, and I hate Sony. Look, yes, I absolutely got my hands on an Xbox Series X early, Microsoft provided an opportunity for me to take a look at the Series X. Sony did not offer that same opportunity, which means that while yes, I made a lot of Series X videos on like talking about it in the news. And then I got my hands-on review and it's all that kind of stuff throughout last year. All of these Sony PS5 videos I did last year were entirely me buying controllers, buying consoles, trying to get my hands on them. Now you can say that, Microsoft giving me a review unit makes me biased and that's fair criticism, if you think that's the way it works. I can tell you though that if I would've had review units of the PS5, I would have made twice as many videos because the numbers don't lie. The PS5 is a far more popular console than the Xbox and therefore, as someone who makes videos that are supposed to be popular, I want to make the thing that is going to perform best. Let me be crystal clear, if a video has a paid sponsorship, I disclose it. Not only because that's the right thing to do, it's also the thing that I have to do legally, right? So when I've been sponsored by Microsoft or Sony or any number of our other sponsors that keep the lights on and keep the channel running and stuff, I will say straight up this video is sponsored by blank. Right? So look, believe me or not believe me, it's up to you. But Microsoft had nothing to do with this PS5 video. And in fact, I would go even farther and like, look, if you think that I'm some biased and Microsoft shill, you know what I did the first second I got my hands on a Series X, an actual fully functional unit? I didn't follow the embargo of like talking about games and stuff. I tried to overheat the thing. Do you think Microsoft was happy when I did a prototype Xbox Series X in months ahead of time, and I make a video trying to overheat it? No, they weren't happy about that. But I don't care, right? As long as I'm not breaking some rule or anything like that, I want to make the videos that are most interesting and relevant to you, right? I want to find these things out. I find it super fascinating. You know what that Series X video was all about? It was a similar concept to what I did with this PS5. I was putting it in boxes, I was trying to cut off the air flow. I was trying to see exactly how far you could push the Series X to see if it was actually engineered correctly versus something like, I don't know, some of the older systems that had overheating issues or whatever the case is. In fact, the Series X video I did last year has been intercut on Twitter with my PS5 video to make it seem like I'm like making the Series X look good and the PS5 look bad. Look, you can absolutely hold me to this. If Microsoft comes out with a follow-up Xbox Series X or Series S that is downgraded, is less powerful in the cooling or whatever, I will 1000% make a video on it and call them out the exact same way that I've called out Sony, right? If that is the case, if they do that, I will be happy to dive into it to find out exactly to the best of my ability what's going on and I will make a video all about it. You have my word on that. What's happened at this point is that, well, Microsoft hasn't changed it at all, they're shipping the exact same console, which, you know, good or bad, doesn't really matter, it's the exact same console for thermal performance. That's not what I've been talking about with this PS5 thing. I'm purely talking about the old PS5 versus the new PS5, they're charging you the exact same amount for, and yet has a inferior cooling solution. Look, if you think I'm wrong, that's your opinion. And be my guest, if you want to make memes, you want to go make videos on why Austin Evans is a liar, go for it, right? Cash in on the controversy, it's not like I've never done a video on something controversial. But things are, this is a PS5, right? The doxing and some of the more extreme elements of this, I think are way out of proportion. Right, I get it. I am making content, I am making things that you may not agree with. I stand behind the video I made, I stand behind my opinion, which again, agree with or disagree with, that's fine. But the level of toxicity in the community, I think is, it's a lot, right? Now, not to name names, and this is not me, but people I know in the sort of this space have gotten like death threats and just like ridiculous stuff, which there's no excuse for that, right? Ultimately, we're talking about a PS5, right? I'm talking about a PS5, which is a couple degrees warmer, that has a slightly smaller heat sink. It's not worth taking things to such a ridiculous degree. That's why I'm making this video. That's why, I would be very happy if this is the last time I have to talk about this. But it's something that I wanted to say. Something I wanted to get out there because it's a lot. So, that's it. Thank you for watching, especially if you made it this far. And your regularly scheduled programming will resume shortly. But yeah.",

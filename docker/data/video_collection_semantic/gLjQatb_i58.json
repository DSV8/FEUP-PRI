    "transcript": "previously on dawid does tech stuff: it's not firing up with the 1070 in it either oh no i killed it it's the 3080ti was too much for it and the power supply just committed hara caring which brings me to today's video where i got my hands on a beefier power supply for the msi system all the way from japan so that i can do everything in my power to get that 3080ti to run terribly in this msi system even if it costs me my fingers ah but before that it's time for a word from today's video sponsor today's video is sponsored by be quiet and their pure loop aios now it goes without saying that the pure loop aios are easy to mount come in a variety of sizes and with its unique pump design is surprisingly quiet for an aio but what i like most about these aios is their minimalist aesthetic i think they look real sexy with that brushed metal faceplate and that diffused white led and considering that you don't have to pay ridiculous rgb tax on these they are surprisingly affordable and they have a fill port on an aio which i think is really cool so if you like the look of these check out the pure loop aios using the link in my description below and thank you again be quiet for sponsoring today's video now a lot of you are probably thinking darvit that is just a 600 watt power supply which really is not a great pairing for an rtx 380 ti but the main reason i got it is because i really like triggering garys so for the type of person that gets offended by this power supply choice look at it look at it no actually the real reason is this was just the best option i could get fsp does make an 850 watt flex power supply but it's got the same problem that i think is going to be the issue for the silverstone power supply that we'll discuss in a little bit and it's longer than the power supply that came in the msi system and i didn't want to risk it not fitting in the case now another interesting thing about this silverstone power supply is that it's got a cybernetics platinum rating which may just sound like a kirkland brand 80 plus rating but cybernetics actually has a more comprehensive test suite that the power supply needs to pass in order to get the rating so i actually think this is better than 80 plus okay so let's have a closer look at the power supply we're going to use to torture an rtx 3080 ti with wow that is not super well packaged now it comes with quite a standard japanese power cord here with the little extraneous ground cable pull that off and oh it's so cute and little now on the back we have a worryingly small fan i think this is gonna just be inappropriately noisy but we'll see how that goes and then uh we've got a non-modular power supply now the msi system does actually have some proprietary connectors on the motherboard for power but i did get an adapter off of amazon so we should still be able to use this power supply now this power supply does have a 50 amp 12 volt rail on it which i'm hoping will be able to handle a bottlenecked 3080ti uh but we'll see how it goes you know we'll see what happens all i hope is that it doesn't explode under any form of load so that we can like underclock and underpower the gpu that it in a way that it does work but now that we've had a very brief look at this little power supply let's drop it into the msi system and just hope that when the previous power supply died it didn't just take the whole system with it now if you have a closer look at this motherboard you can see that it looks like it's just a slightly extended standard itx motherboard which means that if the previous power supply did kill this motherboard we may be able to just replace it like if you drop an itx motherboard over it you can see the the screw holes do actually line up for it oh yeah don't you just love a nice proprietary connector now you can see here that the silverstone power supply board is actually smaller than the one that's in here hopefully i can get it mounted decently do this okay well that's not ideal now after evaluating various options i think the ghettoist solution is going to be the best i'm just going to kind of leave it resting like this because with the pc the right way up it's just going to be wedged down by that plate which there's very little clearance so it is actually going to kind of hold it in place yeah why not let's let's sort the cables out and then see if the system runs which went well oh it's such a small hole please ah come on oh that's just one ah now considering that we have the predictably inconvenient proprietary motherboard power we're gonna need this adapter which is a 24 pin to 10 pin cable in order to get that uh that silverstone power supply to work in here okay well that all looks fine to me so let's close it up and find out if that power supply took its family with it on its way out i think it killed the whole system on its way out ah well that's a shame i'm i'm pretty sure the actual core system in here has died the next step is to replace it with a newer itx motherboard now i think if we can remove this hard drive cage it'll make it a whole lot easier to get that motherboard out now i do think that it is removable because i've already undone a couple of screws holding it in place but it's not coming undone yet uh so maybe there are a couple of more screws under here that we need to get out wait so under this top panel which i didn't even realize was removable there's a hidden hot-swappable ssd caddy who designed this case why did they hide two hot-swappable hard drive caddies under the dvd drive that's hidden under the top panel this is such a ridiculous pc holy crap because of all of this proprietaryness this is definitely not going to be a clean transplant but you know you never know until you try okay so after about two years of struggling here is the slightly deformed itx motherboard you can have a closer look at all of the proprietary connectors we've got the 10 pin over here we've got some proprietary fan connectors over here at least all of the sata was standard but here we've got a bunch of like front panel connectors and stuff now i quickly want to test this motherboard outside of the case with a known working power supply just to make sure that it did actually suffer death by 3080ti because i don't see any obvious signs of motherboard failure like scorch marks around the power delivery or anything like that a few moments later no it did that's actually not the driest looking thermal base okay well there's a big problem uh msi you just yeah couldn't have made this harder could you because of the fact that the cpu socket is oriented differently on this motherboard and you can see that it's actually further away from the rear i o because of those factors it means that this cooler it can't fit on that because even if you have less obstruction over here and you can actually get the cooler to mount it actually overhangs the back of the motherboard so it's not gonna work so long story short our options are getting more limited here and i think our best bet is probably going to be to use a motherboard with just like a standard cooler on it something like this stock amd cooler which actually is lower profile than this coolers high point the problem is that this cooler is just going to be asphyxiated by the back of the gpu so the temperatures are going to be horrendous in here but i i don't know what other options i have at this point would you look at that at least the screw holes line up so the pcie bracket actually plugged in which is good uh although we do not have a whole lot of clearance as you can see my finger can barely fit between the bracket and the top of the fan and not only that but the rtx 3080ti founders edition card has a rear blowing fan which is very possibly just gonna be dumping a bunch of heat into the cpu cooler so hopefully we don't cause some silicone fusion today but let's reassemble the system and see how that goes okay now this is some real satan level design decision making here because they take a standard connector right this connector is what a front panel connector looks like in a case like an nzxt one uh so you think like oh that may actually fit but what they've done is they've just shrunken it ever so slightly down from standard so that it looks like a standard connector but it doesn't actually fit on anything useful now the reason that this whole power button fiasco is so irritating is that once we have a graphics card in here we're not just gonna be able to screwdriver savage power on the system because there's a graphics card in the way now what i've done in order to get around msi's evil ways is i just stole the power button from a different case so that i can position this somewhere more easily accessible inside this pre-built case i don't know i feel like that isn't looking too bad so yeah let's just drop the graphics card back in here and then test it i guess hey would you look at that the cpu cooler actually has a bit of room to breathe that's enough right nice that sounds good you can see things are spinning in there yay success oh it shot down again well the battlefield 5 menus are clearly just way too much for these flex power supplies but considering that we've got some some motherboard rgb still going i think that the power supply didn't die this time so that's a good start okay nice there we go it's not dead this time which is a genuine improvement over the previous configuration so now now we can start playing around with the power limits on that gpu and then maybe we can get it to a point where it can run battlefield 5's menus which really would be the dream that power supply is really annoyingly loud so all i'm going to do here is take the power limit slider and just kind of just do that with it i mean i could if i wasn't a complete savage under vault of the gpu uh but let's see if this works and then we'll we'll take it from there so as you can see it is drawing a whole lot less power oh come on it's crashed again what the hell okay well let's just do that okay there we go it's drawing 110 watts now like it the power supply has to be able to handle this right okay well at 110 watts the system's not crashed yet so that's good that's a step in the right direction our rtx 3080 ti is drawing just 110 ish watts and we're getting 210 megahertz of core frequency going uh but we're we're still getting about 60 frames per second in battlefield 5 which interestingly enough battlefield 5 is actually performing worse now than it did with the 1070 but that's not the point of this video we've got we've got a bigger graphics card name number in the system that's the only thing we care about and um the system's actually running so i think what i'm going to do now is slowly pull up that slider in msi afterburner until the pc crashes oh that's made a considerable performance difference and it's not increased our power draw that much so that's interesting going from 110 ish to 140ish has given us more than double the fps okay so the power draw to performance metric of the rtx 3080 ti is definitely not a linear graph and i think now it's actually running better than it did on the 1070 if i'm not mistaken okay so that's made quite a big difference to our power draw figure but our frame rates it's a little bit better it's not much better though now clearly the reason we're not getting more performance is because that 5300 g is a bottleneck here i'm not quite sure why it's drawing so little power in this situation but either way let's replace the cpu in there and see if we can get more performance out of the system holy that is glued on there oh whoa oh there we go wow that thermal paste is dry as hell that is definitely one of the reasons the temperatures were struggling even with a low power draw that all makes sense now now even with that new cpu in there and just a 58 power draw limit on the rtx 3080 ti we've had to bump up the resolution from 1080p to 4k just so that we don't run into a cpu bottleneck but now that we are at 4k ultra settings uh we're still getting about 110 frames per second and it's it's running well everything seems to be okay so let's let's bump up the power draw a little bit and see how it goes oh yeah we're actually already getting to a point again at 4k where the 3600 is a bottleneck so that's wow that is crazy the the 3080ti even when heavily kneecapped is still a complete monster where the power supply is gonna tap out so let's see when we hit that oof that that cpu is not having a good time anymore there's someone with me oh there we go 75 is just too much for it at this point so at the end of the day i think the reason why flex power supplies crumble neath the mighty tread of an rtx 3080 ti is because the ones that i've found only have a single pcie power cable that splits off to dual eight pins making it easy for the graphics card to overdraw the cable and lead to power supply death which brings me to the end of the video bye you",

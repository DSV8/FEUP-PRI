The most intriguing tech in the R1 is what Rabbit calls the Large Action Model. Where a large language model, or LAM, is all about analyzing and creating text, the LAM is supposed to be about doing stuff. But in our week-long testing, the R1 has consistently proven to be underwhelming, unpredictable and often wrong and entirely pointless.

    "transcript": "- [David] What is this? - [AI] You are holding a taco. - I think AI gadgets might just be impossible. I've been testing this thing, the rabbit r1, for about a week now, and I don't know how to draw any other conclusions about it than that. The r1 has the same big ideas as the Humane Ai Pin, the Smart Glasses from Meta and RayBan, and frankly, countless other apps, platforms, and gadgets to let you do stuff just by asking. In theory, you can just spend your day living your life, walking around, and chatting away with your gadget. What does this plaque say? Do you know what monument this is? What kind of animal is this? It all seems so easy, it seems simple, it seems kind of futuristic. It just absolutely 100% does not work well enough to be worth your time or your money. (David laughing) - Were you recording? - [Crew] Did you read any of this? - It was so wrong. - [AI] The plaque in the image contains an inscription that reads, \"These in the presence of Washington at Valley Forge...\" - [David] Nope. - [AI] \"Whose faith in the continuing union inspired their hearts and whose light in illuminating their minds was as the light which led. These made the arsenal of democracy and the arsenal of freedom.\" - Again, it's like the vibe is the same, all the words are wrong. Basically what I'm saying is life with the r1 should be awesome. It's kind of a mess. - [AI] I cannot. I cannot. I cannot. I cannot. I cannot. I cannot. I cannot... Can I assist with something else? - With the r1 in particular, I think I can probably explain most of its issues just by talking about music. The r1 connects to Spotify, which I like. I use Spotify, this seems like a win. I love the idea of a dedicated music gadget that I can take on walks or runs, use for podcasts, all that good stuff. A Spotify iPod is actually a thing I've wanted for a long time, and it's... Well, let's just try it. Play \"Fortnight\" by Taylor Swift. - [AI] On it. I'll get the music going for you. I see you watching me Every move I make You gotta - That is \"Fortnight\" by Taylor Swift. You love to see it. Play my Discover Weekly playlist. - [AI] On it. I'll get the music going for you. (upbeat music) - This one's my favorite. It's a song called \"Can You Discover?\" by a band called Discovery, which is dead wrong, but you can see how it got there, right? Anyway, this is not a Spotify iPod. It's just kind of a disaster. I can't even really figure out how to control the music, either. Sometimes, I press the button to pause and nothing happens, and if I scroll down, it goes to the next song. But if I scroll up first, it goes to the home screen, and then I have to click back in just to be able to click again to pause. It's all just confusing. No, don't play the... Now, I won't even pause. This is the button you press to pause the music. Okay, we did it. We paused it, everybody, great job. The r1 connects to Spotify through what's known as a large action model, which rabbit describes as basically a way for the device to use your apps actually navigating their interfaces for you. The large action model is really rabbit's biggest idea that, instead of just connecting you to information, answering questions, all the ChatGPT stuff, the action model can actually do things on your behalf. On the r1, it only connects to four, just four: Uber for rides, DoorDash for food, Midjourney for generating images, and Spotify for music. But in theory, in theory, you'll someday be able to teach the r1 to use any app for you, but there's theory and there's reality. I have never once, for instance, successfully managed to order DoorDash. Order food. - [AI] DoorDash may take a while to load on rabbit OS and may not be available in all regions. There was an issue with the food ordering service. Please try again later. Thank you for your understanding. - And then it fails. Same with Uber, though I at least successfully got a little further in the process a few times. Get me a ride. I'm going to Dulles Airport in Washington D.C. - [AI] Uber may take a while to load on rabbit OS and may not be available in all regions. Apologies, the Uber Ride request couldn't be processed. Please provide your drop-off location. - I did that already. You get the idea. Also, I'm sorry, but if you have to tell me how slow an app is while it's loading, you maybe shouldn't have shipped that app. Anyway, so far, the large action model is basically a bust. At best, it's super hacky, as you can see, and at worst, it's not even actually novel AI at all. There's plenty of software out there that uses computer vision to navigate apps, and it actually sounds like rabbit is using one of them called Playwright. Let's just ignore all of those features for now. Neat sounding idea, total mess in execution, and unfortunately that's not where the mess ends. Like with the Humane Ai Pin, there is an incredibly long list of really basic things that this device just can't do. Remind me in three hours to take out the laundry. - [AI] Laundry reminder saved to the rabbithole. - It's a note it won't remind you. Set a timer for 45 minutes. - [AI] I cannot set timers. If you need a reminder... - Send me an email with five recommendations for things to do in Washington D.C. - [AI] Visit the National Mall, a linear park filled with monuments, such as the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington. - Can you send me all this in an email? - [AI] I cannot send emails. You can save this information by taking a note in the rabbithole. - And of course, since this is an all-AI gadget, you can't do anything at all offline. You can add a SIM card in here, like I did, so you can get data everywhere, but it doesn't have GPS or navigation, and it can't make calls or send messages, so it's really not more useful than whatever device you're already inevitably bringing with you. I do have some slight good news here. A couple of days ago, actually while we were in the middle of shooting this video, rabbit updated the r1 and fix a bunch of what I would call showstopping bugs. The battery no longer drains in a few hours, even if you're not using it, though it's still not gonna last all day. The thing actually shows the correct time, which it didn't before. What a concept. rabbit has said all along that it knows it's early and will update this device frequently and quickly, and it's definitely true that a lot of what's wrong here is software, but even after this first update, we are nowhere near this feeling like a functional device. The main two things people will do with the r1, other than getting really mad at the broken app control stuff anyway, is ask it questions and have it identify things in the world around you. The r1 does both of these reasonably well. I like pointing the thing at a sign, or a plaque, or a document and having it summarize things for me. Actually, we're in Washington D.C., home of a million landmarks, and plaques, and touristy things. Let's go try a few, see how it works. - [AI] The image appears to depict a large statue of Abraham Lincoln seated in the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C. - There we go. - [AI] This appears to be the Gettysburg Address. (upbeat music) - It handles all the standard ChatGPT-style stuff well enough, which isn't surprising. It's connecting to all that stuff, but it's also not that hard to get that stuff right, and it does tend to be really wordy when it does so. Plus, sometimes, it works. What's the score of the Series now? - [AI] The Denver Nuggets won the Series against the Los Angeles Lakers with a final score of 108-106 in Game 5, which took place on April 29th, 2024. Jamal Murray was the standout player for the Nuggets, scoring 32 points and hitting the game-winning shot with 3.6 seconds left on the clock. LeBron James had a strong performance for the Lakers with 30 points and 11 assists, but it wasn't enough to secure the win. The Nuggets will now face the Minnesota Timberwolves in the second round of the playoffs starting next weekend in Denver. - And sometimes it doesn't. How do I get to the Lincoln Memorial from here? - [AI] The Memorial will remain open to the public during the renovation, with only a small visitor space located below ground being closed. Give me a moment to look that up for you. To get to the Lincoln Memorial from Homefront Dr. Washington D.C., 20037, USA, you can take the Blue/Orange/Silver Line to the Foggy Bottom metro station, which is about a 15 to 20-minute walk to the Memorial. - The correct answer was go up those stairs right there in front of you. - [AI] Alternatively, you can take the Blue/Orange/Silver Line to the Smithsonian Metro Station. - Nope, when it works best is when you have really identifiable things, but at that point, do you really need the help? This thing can tell me what's on a can or what the label says on a bag of chips, but it says it right there. - [AI] The Doritos Cool Ranch Chips in the image show that a serving size contains 150 calories, so the number of calories- - [David] Correct. - [AI] In a serving of these Doritos chips is 150 calories. - What are we accomplishing here? And honestly, what are we doing that I couldn't do with Google Lens on my phone? I think the answer is not that much. The Humane Ai Pin, I actually understand in theory. It's a wearable thing that sits on your body, making some basic functionality more accessible. This is just another thing to carry in your pocket or purse that can't do anything your phone can't do better. I cannot, for the life of me, come up with one thing that this does better than your phone. And that feels like a problem, but let's just, for one second, leave all of that aside. I do believe the AI stuff will get better eventually, so let's just say that the large action model works. Again, it doesn't, I cannot stress that enough, but let's just say that someday it does. The question left, then, is whether the r1 is a good device for that future, and the answer is kind of. There is something about the r1 I find very charming. It's not fancy, as you can obviously see, but it's also $200 and doesn't have a subscription, so I don't expect it to be as nicely made as something like the Ai Pin, and it's not, but I really like this orange color. I think it's a nice size. Purely as a little designy gizmo, I actually dig it, and honestly that does count for something, but nothing about using this device feels intuitive to me. You interact with the r1 in a couple of ways. There's this button on the side for activating it so you can talk to it. Look, the the ears perk up when you do it. It's so charming. There's also this scroll wheel, which lets you- - [AI] Thank you for the compliment. - You're welcome. There's also this scroll wheel, which lets you page through menus and information. And there's the 2.88-inch screen, which is not a good screen, but it's fine. The combo of these things feels right. I really wish the Humane Pin had a screen for when you wanna see the weather, rather than having it read to you. Or you wanna review something you've said before you send it off somewhere else. Screen, plus microphone, plus speaker, plus camera feels right. And yes, I'm very aware that I just described a smartphone, and I think this thing is probably too close to a smartphone to have much of a chance to be different, but let's just keep going with this design, just for one more second. Here's where it gets weird. This screen is a touch screen, but only sometimes. When the keyboard shows up, you can type on it, which is good, but when you're in Settings, or looking at the weather, or whatever, all you can do is scroll the wheel. This doesn't make any sense to me at all, and it makes the r1 harder to use because you have to hit the button with one hand and then sort of shift around and scroll with the other. There are lots of little weird things like this on the r1. You shake the device twice to get the settings menu, but then there's no obvious way to get back. You just have to scroll around until you stumble on the Back button at the top and then click the Side button to go home. There's nothing indicating how that works, and none of it feels at all intuitive. Honestly, the best single feature I've found on this device, by a mile, is the voice recorder. As a reporter, I probably use voice recorders more than most, but this one is pretty easy to use. It does some AI summarization and actually has a pretty high-quality microphone. You just say, \"Start the voice recorder.\" Start the voice recorder. And there it goes. Voice recorder. And then you scroll down and hit Stop because the touch screen doesn't work. - [AI] Starting the recording now. (David laughing) - Which you did after it was done. God, you suck. Oh, boy. Okay, anyway. The more I use this thing, the more I feel like rabbit spent all of its time making the r1 fun, and silly, and whimsical, and none of its time making it work. I love this little bouncing logo. I like that it gets headphones when you're listening to music, but I don't care about any of that because it doesn't play the songs it's supposed to. Humane, it felt like, tried to mask its device's flaws under this really shiny, luxurious, thoughtful piece of hardware, and rabbit went all the way the other way and seems to just hope you'll think this thing is a toy and not mind that it's broken. Right now, if you buy one of these, you're buying a fun-looking $200 desk toy and not a useful gadget because this isn't a useful gadget. I don't think it'll be one anytime soon, if ever. I do think the large action model is a cool idea, and it might be the future of AI in some meaningful ways, but there's not one shred of evidence in this device that rabbit is going to be the company to figure it out. I continue to think there will be lots of interesting AI gadgets in the future, but for now, and probably for a while, your phone is just going to be better at everything. You don't need the rabbit r1, nobody does. Just keep your phone charged, you'll be fine. Are you saying I can't eat tomatoes? - [AI] No, I'm not saying you can't eat tomatoes. This appears to be a red bell pepper, not a tomato. You are holding a red bell-shaped vegetable with the word KONE printed on it.",

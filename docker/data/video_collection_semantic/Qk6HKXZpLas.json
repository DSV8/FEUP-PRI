    "transcript": "- Why does everyone still buy Pixel phones when six months later the A comes out and usually it's better in most ways? That might still be the case here with the new Pixel 7a. We have it in this weird coral version and I'm excited to take a look as, though I'm not a longtime Pixel fan, I did use the 7 Pro for a good little bit there when it first came out and it was a pretty nice phone, but very big and pretty darn expensive. The A line is Pixel's more accessibly priced ones with usually some mid-range specs, but this one is a bit interesting because they do have a lot of the specs that you know and love from the full size Pixel phones. Unboxing the phone here, we have the nice bit of plastic that covers it and this very vibrant color that we will talk about in a bit here. We have a USB-C to C cable that is knotty. This doesn't really feel like three feet. And an OTG cable so you can plug in your USB-A devices. Usually you use it once just to transfer over all of your information from your old phone and then you don't use it ever again. But hey, if you wanna plug a keyboard I into your phone, I'm not gonna stop you. We also got a sim popper, a booklet. It's a very fancy little box for nothing. And that's it for the unboxing. Very, very simple. You get a cable, you get the OTG, you get no brick, and right at the bat I gotta say I like the color. I'm not 100% sold. I've actually gotten used to having a more vibrant phone. I usually go for just a black phone, it fits with everything you have and, you know, usually cover up with a case if you're a case user anyways. I've been using the kind of purple OPPO Find N2 Flip and I get a lot of comments on it. People like a colorful phone and this is another very, very colorful phone. So we have the coral version here though it does come in black, sea, and snow, which I'm guessing is black, blue, and white. Is that the order I did it? But you know, you can't just say that anymore. It's, you gotta be creative and it's definitely like a, a Sara Dietschy peach. It's very, very vibrant. As for the design, it's very reminiscent of the 7 and the 6 before it with the 3D metal visor, though the bump is very small. I haven't actually used the regular 7, so I don't know if this is similar to that, but I know the 7 Pro, the visor is very, very thick and it is not too bad on this one. Other than that, on the back we have the G, so you know it's a Google phone and then we have our two cameras and flash. It is a little bit fingerprinty, I don't know if you'll be able to see, I got greasy gamer fingers, but it does feel pretty nice. It doesn't feel super plasticy or anything like that. I know there have been past Pixel phones where, you know, it is definitely full on plastic. Moving around the side of the phone, on the right side we have our power button and volume rocker as well as our antenna lines. On the top we have more antenna lines and our mic hole. And then on the left we have three more antenna lines and our sim tray. And finally on the bottom we have two speakers and a USB-C for charging and let's pop it open. Google historically does not do dual sim, as far as I'm aware. For physical you do get an e-sim but maybe that changes here and yeah, it's just one nano sim. Some people don't really care as long as they have e-sim, but I actually really like having dual physical sim. It makes it easy for someone like me who switches phones very often, but I'm also abnormal and you probably aren't switching your phone all that often, so. With the A series, like I said, it's usually they're more kind of entry level or mid-range phone and sometimes you get cutbacks from the flagship phones because of that, but it does still have a good weight to it. We'll wait and see how much it is. 192 grams, that's what, five slices of bread? No, I'm only gonna get lucky with that once, there's no way I'm gonna get that again. I know one of the ways they did reduce probably the cost and maybe the weight is this front display. So it's a 6.1 inch gOLED screen. Don't know what the G stands for. None of the stuff we got here before release explains what that is, but I'm gonna assume it stands for Google because they gotta be special. It is with Gorilla Glass 3 though, which is interesting. So they used something that's a couple generations old. Obviously we survived a year with Gorilla Glass 3 before, but it does seem like a bit of a steep drop off from the Victus 2 we're getting a lot of flagships now, but if that's gonna be what saves you, you know, a couple hundred dollars here or there, it's probably worth it and just don't drop your phone. All of your information. Another way they're able to reduce pricing is that it is just a 60 to 90 hertz screen, so you're not getting the full 120 hertz that we're getting in a lot of flagships now, but 90 hertz still is quite good and, again, if you've only been on a 60 hertz screen before, those steps up really do make a difference for your everyday usage and it is IP67 plus new to the Pixel 7a compared to the 6a, this has wireless charging. This is a 4,385 milliamp power battery, which is a little bit lower than the 5,000 milliamp power batteries we're getting in other flagships or even budget to mid-range phones. But it does include 7.5 watt wireless charging and up to 18 watt fast charging. That's not the fastest cable charging, but again for most folks that's probably fine and the addition of wireless charging is huge and it might not seem like that big of a deal if you don't have it right now, but as somebody who's had it and lost it, not having wireless charging in my phone sucks. You know, a lot of cars now have wireless charging pads or if you're just like in an office and you wanna be able to see your phone with like the Google Pixel stand or whatever like that, it is really great to have. And size-wise for the phone it's like the same as the 6a. So if you are coming from that phone it does look very, very similar. Obviously again the visors are a little bit different and there's like, you know, point five of a millimeter difference on dimensions, but otherwise they are very, very similar looks-wise. But that's pretty much all there is for the outside of the phone, so I guess we should hear from our sponsor dbrand. For some reason Google sent us the coral one and, you know, maybe they thought Linus was gonna unbox it. He likes the pink car, the pink everything. But for myself I wanted something a little bit more fashionable like the black one. So we hit up our friends at dbrand to send us over a black Pixel 7a, but they told us to off and sent us something better. The grip case. Now you may know that I'm not a big case user, I just believe that you shouldn't drop your phone then you can use your phone in its nice slick glass, metal, plastic body, whatever it's made of, and it feels great in the hand. But if I were to use a case, obviously it would be the dbrand grip case because it has thousands of contact points with their super fine dots so it sticks to anything. Look, it's not going anywhere. Plus your phone is totally fine. Even though our relationship with dbrand might be a little hit and miss, I mean they're kind of douchebags if you haven't noticed, they do know how to make a great product that goes with any outfit like this one or this high quality shirt. It just goes with anything. Also it has nice clicky buttons. Listen, nice. What do you think of this? - Ooh, clicky buttons. - And he's not sponsored by dbrand. - No way, man. - So if you wanna fit in with all the cool kids and protect your phone, go to shortlinus.com and tell 'em Bell sent ya. Or don't. I don't know, I don't really care, honestly. We can cut now. Dbrand's great, but if you don't like their cases for whatever weird reason, we do have one of the Google Pixel 7a cases in a very conflicting color that almost certainly will not go well. I'm guessing, is this the sea color? We'll never know what they call it, but it does look like the seafoam blue. Green? Blue? It has that kind of like soft touch silicone plastic feel that I'm actually really not a fan of. If you have like a pair of the XM5s or anything like that, it's that same as like the headband. And yeah, I mean I guess it kind of goes well together if you like a bit of a statement to look. But yeah, I'm not a fan of the the feel of this case. I don't know how much it costs, but stick with dbrand or caseless. Shill. I want dbrand to like me. Leave that in. All right, putting up the phone here, right away it's asking if we want suggestions on the home screen. I'm never a fan of stuff like this. I'm glad you get an option of turning it off right away 'cause I know quite a few phones you have to go into the home screen settings and change it to be off of having suggestions at the top. It's like never correct. In an iPhone, I know Siri suggestions are also awful, so I'm really happy for that. Booting it up, obviously this is a Pixel phone, it's stock Android. You're not gonna have anything super fancy for skins or overlays or anything that's gonna slow down your phone or, you know, prevent a layer between you and what you want to actually access in your phone, which I'm a big fan of. As somebody who used to be a big fan of HTC sense back in the day with the cool widgets that would like it had like the cloud, the rain cloud for the weather and everything like that. I loved that. As I've grown older I've realized that sucks and it slows down your phone and really just muddies up everything you're doing. So having stock Android is obviously great and with a Pixel phone, you're getting a lot of the features that coming soon to Android, like call screening, the now playing for music in the background, everything like that that, again, nice to have. Again, for all these apps that you do see here on here, a lot of 'em are going to be things that we've installed for labs testing like the games, Reddit, everything like that. You would just have the Google versions of all of these apps. So if you're coming from Samsung and you like their notes or OPPO and you like the Zaza remote, you might not get that here, but you do get all the base Android apps that I do usually find quite a bit better and, you know, use for myself even when I'm on different Android operating systems. And speaking of stock Android, we do have Android 13 here, which is the latest version and I'm sure you'll get the next version as well and maybe even the version after that, that'd be nuts. That'd be unheard of. And Google promises five years of security updates, which is again great and a trend we like to see. And for other specs on the phone, this is the eight gigs of RAM and 120 gigs of storage model, which is the only model. So if you're somebody who downloads a ton of playlists, games, or you know films, a lot of movies on this, you'll wanna be aware that you are limited on storage and would have to look at cloud alternatives or be sure to back up your phone and take stuff off fairly often. I personally don't have issues with 120 gigs of storage, but I know people have commented in videos saying that is not enough for them and they need that one terabyte version and I've said it before and say it again, that's, that's suss. It's a little suss. What is cool is that this is still powered by the Tensor 2 chip that is in the 7 and 7 Pro. So you're not gonna see a huge performance difference, hopefully. So it is nice that they're not gonna purposely nerf this phone just to get you to a higher end model or anything like that. And it does have the Titan M2 security chip so it'll be protecting your logins and passwords, everything like that, which is something we should take a look at. Does it have a fingerprint scanner? It's clearly not built into the power button. Usually you can visibly tell, there'll be a ring around it or something like that to make it more clear. So let's see if it has an under display fingerprint scanner. Well that's a good sign right off the bat it says face and fingerprint unlock. So depending on what you like to do to unlock your phone, you have a couple different options. I'm more of a fan of fingerprints, I feel it's a little bit more secure than face, but you can always use both so you have the quick access to take a look at your information and you know if it's down on a table, you can use your finger or whatever like that, but let's see how fast it is. Alright, the moment of truth Pretty quick. The only thing I wish is that would wake up when you put your thumb on the fingerprint scanner. I know there's quite a few phones that are kind of primed and ready so as soon as it feels your finger on that spot, it'll light up and let you into your phone. It is a little bit annoying to have to like double tap the screen or make sure to hit the power button, but first world problems. Otherwise for connectivity and all the other inside specs, it's pretty bog standard. You have wifi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3 and 5G. But what is interesting is you can pay a premium to get 5G Millimeter Wave. So if you're in a big city where they have Millimeter Wave 5G and you want those ultra fast speeds, you can pay an extra 50 bucks to get that added to your phone, but I feel like for most people, maybe, you probably don't need that. I feel like 5G Millimeter Wave is still a little bit out, but again, if that works for your city and you want those super fast speeds, go for it. Our model here is the 5G Millimeter Wave which could explain why there are so many antenna lines all over the phone. Now let's get into display and speakers. We've got a hankering for some crab rave, it's been a while, you know? It's been a while. Crab song. Who searched crab song? (laughing) (upbeat music) I gotta say I'm pretty impressed. It does seem to clip a little bit at the highest volume. Again, I don't feel like most people are listening to things at max volume, but if you're gonna allow your speaker to go that loud you should make sure that it's not going to have any rattles or you know, sound bad. But surprisingly it didn't feel like it was super balanced to the right side of the phone. It did still feel like it was kind of coming from a center channel and especially when you're holding it in your hands with you know kind of cupping it to bring the audio more towards your face, it sounded quite good. As for the screen quality, it looks great, it's an OLED. It is only full hd but I don't feel like you can really tell on the phone this small unless you're getting really, really close to it. It still did look quite sharp. My only real complaint on the display is that I do wish it got a little bit brighter. What you're looking at is max brightness, which you can tell is not super, super bright 'cause it's not peaking the camera. It does get up to 495 minutes in SDR, which isn't bad when it comes to the other Pixel phones. I know the 6 and 6a both get to 495 and the Pixel 7 surprisingly gets to 475 and this Pixel 7 Pro gets quite a bit higher at 595 nits. And these might just be numbers to the average person that it's watching this, but just know that you want to higher number so that when you go outside you can still see it in daylight and this will probably be fine, but not fantastic. Alright, let's go into cameras. That's where Google usually shines. I'm a big fan of ultra wides. I find I use them more than Telephotos though, obviously having both is great and having that limited to the pro series I guess makes sense. They want your money and obviously if they can charge you an arm and a leg for an extra camera, they're gonna. These are pretty decent stats. The main camera can shoot up to 4K 60 and the ultra wide 4K 30, which is plenty if you are somebody who is shooting in 4K for some reason. All right, here's a main camera photo. Oh interesting. When you take a photo right off the bat it has a share option that pops up off the gallery. Now let's try a zoom. This would just be a digital zoom as obviously this does not have an optical lens. And an ultra wide. Dang that's wide. It does 125 degrees for the ultra wide, which is more than the human eye, let me tell you. I gotta say this ultra wide looks pretty darn sharp. When you zoom really far in, you can see it's like getting a little bit painting like, but for everything that's kind of the near vicinity to you or just when it's zoomed out and there's nothing too too crazy for lens distortion which is where at the edges it'll look kind of weird compared to the rest of the photo. Onto the 2x looks pretty good. You are just digitally zooming into the main sensor. But with 64 megapixels it does give you quite a bit of room to still get detail in the photos. And for the main shot, it looks good. We can zoom right into Sven's weird face, see all the detail in there and his tattoos into David's shirt. The colors all seem really consistent and the brightness, again, looks really good across the whole scene. Especially 'cause where I'm sitting is very well lit, but everything around the set is not. So being able to see everything clearly and the lighting seems pretty consistent is great. For something with a bit more color to give you an idea about color accuracy, we'll take a photo of this kind of set here. And yeah, this looks very true to life. Everything looks pretty consistent with the green of the plant, the blue from the short circuit lights, and the white, kind of warm white from the lamp. And let's try video. All right, this is 4K 30. I'm moving around to see kind of how it looks. It definitely looks pretty smooth. I don't know if it has OIS as, unfortunately, it's not in any spec sheet, but it does look pretty darn smooth. I would not be surprised if it did. It doesn't have any of that kind of blurriness, but it does look a little bit punched in. I'll compare it to the regular camera here and see if we can tell. Yeah, compared it to the main camera, it definitely is using EIS as it crops the imaging quite a bit. But I gotta say this sounds really good. My voice is really clear. It didn't have like the hum of the room as well. It seems to be able to kind of cut that out or at least didn't pick it up for whatever reason and it looks great as well. Of course 4K, it looks sharp and the EIS looks really good as well. A lot of time when you're shaking on EIS it kinda has that ghosting as it tries to just digitally compensate for what's going on so that you know everything still stays smooth, but this looks really good. If you're gonna be taking videos with your phone for vlogs or anything like that, this is at least a very good start for then adding your own equipment. Let's try the selfie camera though. It's interesting, it has a zoom function. I'm not sure when you would wanna be just a little bit closer, but you do have the option of choosing that. Yeah, these photos look fine. It's a 13 megapixel share that does 4K 30. We'll test that video in a second here. Still looks sharp with the detail in my beard and hair as well as you know, just pores and of course Northern Lights t-shirt now available on lttstore.com. I wouldn't say it looks overprocessed, the colors look pretty solid, especially again with the pretty complex background with the TV and short circuit sign. Like an iPhone if you hold down your photos, you get to nice motion photos, you can always remember the memories of taking that selfie at the pier down in San Francisco. That was a great day. I'm now taking a video. Again, something to note with EIS it does crop in more so you do have the option of using the 1.4 times zoom, but then it feels pretty darn close. But I do like the smooth zoom in and out. It kind of gives you a bit of dramatic-ism, dramatism. But, hey, that's pretty neat. I gotta say I'm not really impressed with the selfie video quality. It looks a little grainy. Again, I'm very well lit right now and of course I'm not outside where it's extremely consistently lit, but my shirt, you can see a lot of noise, it looks pretty soft and at 13 megapixels when it can do 4K 30, I don't feel like it really should look like this. And as for the mic quality it's, yeah, it's fine. One thing I do wish though after listening to this is that the speaker got a little bit louder or that the mic recorded louder. I don't know what the issue is as crab rave seemed to get quite loud as this does not seem to be very loud. Like that's max volume. This is me speaking without speech enhancement. Do I sound better or worse? Only you can tell and me in a second. I can't tell a difference. So maybe if you're outside where it's super windy, maybe it'll be a bigger difference, here it's obviously a bit quiet and in both videos I could hear the hum of the transformer that's behind the camera. So I don't know. Again, your mileage may vary. It's time to game. As we're gaming, we sent this over to labs to get some testing done and the results were surprising. Though it has the same Tensor chip that the 7 and 7 Pro do, The results actually varied quite a bit. Sometimes it performed worse than the 7 and 7 Pro and sometimes it performed better, which is odd. And Genshin Impact the medium frame rate on the 7 and 7 Pro was 61 or 62 FPS respectively. And on the 7a was only 48. But what's even weirder is that in Unhappy Raccoon it actually performed even better on the 6a with it getting 62 FPS. So your mileage may vary based on the games that you're playing, but no matter what, you should get some solid performance in most of the games you're playing. Speaking of labs testing, we also have them tested the battery life. First up labs did a longevity test, which is putting the phone in its kind of best case scenario. So it's video streaming off of YouTube, low brightness, giving it the best odds for maximum battery life. The most you should really expect from this phone. And the results were really good. The Pixel 7a was able to get 21 hours of continuous playback, which is pretty darn good. The Pixel 6a, for example, got 20 hours, which is again great. The Pixel 7 got 16 and a half and the Pixel 7 Pro only got 14 and a quarter hours and it makes with the Pixel 7 Pro being so large and high resolution. Then after that we did the stress test, which is the minimum amount of battery you can expect. That's maximum GPU and CPU usage, maximum brightness, everything like that. Under max load, the 7a was able to get 3.3 hours. The Pixel 6a did also quite well with 3.2 hours. Pixel 7 got 2.7 hours, which is not enough probably for your flight or bus ride, people take the bus still? Take the Greyhound? I don't know. And the Pixel 7 Pro got 3.2. So again, it's interesting to see the difference between the 7 and 7 Pro or even the 7a and 6a as they were all very, very similar but pretty darn good. I feel like if you're going that hard with your phone that you are maxing out the CPU and GPU and using max brightness, you probably have it plugged in. So in those fringe scenarios where you wanna play something intense on the bus or plane or whatever, you should be fine. So how much does this cost? A phone that has a lot in common with its flagship counterparts with just a couple edges cut off here and there. Well it's at a $500 price point, which isn't too bad. Though if you do want the Millimeter Wave 5g, it does cost $50 more at 550. With this being $500 and the Pixel 7 being 600, I would take this any day and pocket that $100 and put it towards, I don't know. - [David] Genshin Skins. - A dbrand case, LTT store merch like this. With better battery life and better performance and some games, it seems like there's no real reason to get the 7, which makes me wonder why Google has this release schedule at all and maybe they should more consider this a T upgrade like OnePlus does instead of the budget alternative. Or I guess maybe we should just appreciate that if you're willing to wait six months, you could probably get a better phone than the one they released six months ago, which I guess makes sense. I don't know. But what do you think? Does it seem like a worthwhile upgrade for those on the 7? Have you been waiting for the new A series like so many people have? Let us know down below. And of course while you're down there hit subscribe, hit like or dislike if you wanna hurt my feelings. And why don't you watch that Unihurtz Lunaphone. That sucked.",

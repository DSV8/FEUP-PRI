    "transcript": "- We're here at the SilverStone booth at Computex 2023 where the story basically is new hardware is really hot and really big and fitting it in a case is kind of a pain in the ass. Let's have a look right here. So this right here is the new ALTA F2 and there is so much airflow in this thing. So if we take a little look down here you can see that we have 380 millimeter fans down below. Those are pushing up through a 560 millimeter radiator which has 440 millimeter fans. So the motherboard, they actually have rotated 90 degrees. Now this has a couple of advantages. Most of all, you're able to have the cooling for the CPU and the GPU completely separate and the whole airflow goes up through the case just like this. That also means that it's going to be relatively quiet for the amount of fans that you have, because, you know, the fans are down here. They're not on the front where you're gonna be hearing all of the noise coming from them. This does mean that plugging in your I/O is gonna be a little bit difficult but it's not too bad. You just push right here, top panel comes off, bippity boppity, there you go. This is very modular. Right now we have a whole bunch of radiators, but say you want a whole bunch of storage, well, there's a bunch of space for them down here or right here. For the GPU there's a lot of options of where you put it. You can put it, you know, just on the motherboard like you'd normally have. I/O goes up here. You can have it vertical, vertical sticking out like this, which I think would look pretty sweet. You also have normal vertical mount, or what they have right here is it tilted at 11.3 degrees. For water cooling like this, doesn't matter. Let's go over and look at the air cooled one. Here we can see the air-cooled version and apparently that 11.3 degrees came after extensive testing. So pivot in its normal vertical orientation, a lot of the air just goes around the GPU instead of intuit and cooling it properly. This right here though, apparently it works good. I don't know, I haven't tested it. Maybe we'll in the future. Now a tilted GPU is pretty cool, but nowhere near as cool a segue to our sponsor. - Thanks to VistaPrint for sponsoring this video. Are you looking to print some personalized products with your own design or logo? VistaPrint can help with that. It's as simple as uploading your design, selecting your product, and checking out. You can even create your own designs with our online, easy to use tools. Have an idea but aren't much of an artist? Their professional designers will help you bring your vision to life. Check out VistaPrint at the link below and print yourself some goodies. - Up next is the Alta D1, which is a highly configurable workstation chassis. Although the story of this starts way back here. Come on, come on. Three years ago, SilverStone released the RM42. That's pretty similar to this one right here but it only had a 240 millimeter rack. When the word got out that they were making a server chassis but that had water cooling support, apparently it has been selling like hotcakes. So now they have the 360 version right here. But then NVIDIA came out and released graphics cards that are frickin' massive. They won't fit in this guy. Oh, look at that. To deal with the absolute insanity that is 40 Series, first of all we have 180 millimeter fans on a server chassis, apparently that's a first, and also we have five views, it's the RM51, so that you can deal with, you know, the absolutely massiveness of the 4090. This one right here is a 3090, but you can imagine it comes up to here or something like that because NVIDIA has just completely jumped the shark. But if you have also jumped the shark and have two CPUs and not one, the RM52 is what you want. Take a look at this, guys. We have one 360 radiator right up here and then behind that, another 360 millimeter radiator right here. So you don't have to share cooling between both of your CPUs. They each get their own dedicated radiator. All of which brings us back to the Alta D1 where all pretenses of practicality have just been completely tossed out of the window. You want fans? 380 millimeter, guys. You want radiators? You can just fit them here and here. Or in this case, they have them configured as drive base. This thing is just 100% you can do whatever you want with it and it is pretty wild. Like, you can look back here. Right now they have a radiator here, but instead you want redundancy, you can put a power supply there, power supply there, or even more redundancy, three power supplies. Screw it, you can do that if you want. Now, of course, you can also fit absolute gobs and gobs of GPUs in here if you feel like just doing a whole bunch of AI work. Dual CPU support, of course. And this thing's just, it's crazy. I love it. Maybe you're looking for power supply redundancy though but don't have a case that'll fit two power supplies. Well, they have a solution for that as well. This is the Gemini 400A Gold and it has two power supplies in it so you do not have to worry about, you know, one of them dies, you are are still good. But, of course, having a case with heaps of cooling is no good if you can't cool your CPU, which we have heaps of right here. This is the XE360SP5, and it is good for 600 watts of cooling. And also, they have the pump up here so they don't have to pay Asetek for all of their patent nonsense. Absolutely awesome. But of course, why stop at cooling your CPU? Right here we have the IceMyst 240 ARGB, and of course, you know, this right here looks like a pretty normal little cooler, but you can take off the top, add on this right here, and, oh wow, this fan wasn't working before, but it works now. Excellent. Now you have cooling for your VRMs. Of course, I couldn't just leave well enough alone, and I asked them, \"Can you put all the fans on one of them?\" They said seven's the max support. We have gone way past that. Look at this absolute contraption right here. What a wonderful thing. SilverStone's celebrating their 20 year year anniversary and, guys, if you keep on making stuff like this, I think we'll have 20 more. So huge thanks for watching hit like, get subscribed, and just have a fantastic old day. I need to keep on holding this or it sags.",

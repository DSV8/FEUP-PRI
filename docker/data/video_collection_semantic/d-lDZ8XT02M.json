    "transcript": "- Don't you just hate when you're expecting to receive your monthly shipment of toilet paper via drone and some rube with a gun shoots it down so you're stuck using your emergency stash of cheap, scratchy single ply? Okay, maybe this hasn't happened to you, but why hasn't it happened to you? Amazon has been promising us drone delivery since all the way back in 2013, when I was but a young graduate. But here we are in 2022, when I'm old, with children, and the skies don't exactly look like Coruscant on Episode I. Unsurprisingly, one big hurdle to mainstream drone delivery is how, once again, the law isn't keeping up with advancements in technology. Aviation is one of the most heavily regulated industries on the planet, and to be fair, it does make sense as if we're gonna travel 500 miles per hour in a glorified bus with wings like we do on a plane, we at least want to feel fairly certain we won't be turned into charred meatballs on landing. But drones aren't exactly the same as commercial airliners. I mean, they aren't carrying people. Yet. But it wasn't until 2016 that the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States passed rules specifically for drones, commonly referred to as Part 107. Although Part 107 made the rules of the sky more straightforward for hobbyists, it didn't do much to help businesses who wanted do deliver orders via drone. Probably the most burdensome rule is that drone operators have to keep their drones within their line of sight, not exactly feasible for big companies like Amazon or Uber who want to deliver lots of packages over fairly long distances. Now, it does turn out that you don't have to fly under Part 107 rules, but unfortunately, if you want to do long-range package delivery in the US you have to get FFA approval under another set of rules called Part 135. And that's a lengthy, onerous, bureaucratic, Kafkaesque process. - We'll tell you more after thanking Alibaba.com for sponsoring today's video. Alibaba.com has their March Expo event going on right now where small business owners can learn how to source high-quality tech products like the T12 Plus Rinse vacuum for their businesses. What's even better is that with the sophisticated digitized sourcing tools Alibaba.com is offering, like their VR showroom and online trade show, where you can meet to talk to suppliers around the globe while sitting comfortably in your living room. They've also partnered with Inc. to launch a 2020 global sourcing trend report to keep you up to date on smart product trends. Learn more about Alibaba.com's March Expo virtual event using the link below. - So most of the rules the FFA enforces are designed for traditional planes that carry traditional people, not small drones carrying burritos or whatever, and new rules have to be adopted that make more sense for delivery drones. But to be fair to our government overlords, the FFA is working to streamline the drone approval process and is also collaborating with private industry to create a dedicated air traffic control system for unmanned drones. But it could take years before this is all developed enough to allow large fleets of delivery drones to take to the skies. Of course, the entire point of the rules is to ensure that aircraft operate safely, and there are questions about that as well. Hobby drones are really light, but package delivering drones like the 11-pounders used by Google subsidiary Wing are quite a bit heavier. And while you super strong people might think that 11 pounds isn't super heavy, it would certainly pose a safety risk if something that weighs about as much as a small dumbbell plummeted from the sky and hit you basically anywhere on your body. Other delivery services will likely be using even heavier drones to deliver larger packages, and while drones may never be required to meet the \"one critical incident in one billion flight hours\" standard of commercial airliners, they'll certainly need to be more stringent requirements than they do now considering off-the-shelf drones can and do fail quite frequently. And it isn't just about mechanical hardiness either. There's currently not much infrastructure in place to control drone traffic or even ensure they won't run into each other or into other objects. Animal attacks on flying drones have even happened. But logistics aside, we can't discount the social part of the equation either. While it would definitely be cool to have a drone bring you an emergency box of corn dogs at three a.m. in a matter of minutes, do we really want a bunch of drones emitting that high-pitched buzzing noise outside of our apartment windows just level with your eye line at all hours of the night or day? And how about ways to discourage theft? Porch pirates are already a problem, so what might happen once the entire delivery process is unattended? Wing has already offered assurances that their drones don't contain high-res cameras in order to protect privacy, but could this embolden would-be package thieves? No one's watching. These are question the industry will need to find answers to if they're going to run delivery services that both make a profit and entice potential customers. So we're definitely not saying drone delivery will never work, just give it a few years. Patience is a virtue, even in the age of Amazon Prime. So thanks for watching, guys.

    "transcript": "hey David I think that this new attack in Lebanon is a good example of life imitating art as you remember we did a video with Mr Robot where Elliott was able to blow up a building the data center by attacking the UPS's so we have something similar took place in Lebanon in the last few days what they did is they built these pagers and they put in for one of the batteries or right next to the lithium battery they put in a small charge of C4 one of the things this is one of the theories is that mosad or whoever has figured out a way to trigger the explosion of these batteries and that would be much more nefarious because it would mean that all of our devices that have lithium batteries in them could be used as weapons. I think a massive worry that I just thought about is which devices do we have these days that have huge battery packs right and they get moving they move around electric cars yeah I mean if they could get access to that I mean can you imagine what they could do there.

Thank you David it's always an honor to be on the best IT and cyber security channel on YouTube. Thanks man for saying that and I have had had a lot of people asking me about this specific topic something's been happening in the Middle East again we've heard about Pagers blowing up and walkie-talkies blowing up and a lot of people have pinged me on YouTube saying can you talk about it can you get OTW to talk about it but just for everyone who's watching just before we talk about that OTW is the author of this book Linux Basics for Hackers we have done a whole series on this book so I'll link that below OTW is also written this book Network Basics for Hackers as well as Getting Started becoming a Master Hacker OTW you the guy like to talk to about like real world hacks and Mr Robot hacks so perhaps you know I'm I'm leading you on here but perhaps you can tell us about what's been going on you know tell us about some of the stuff we've perhaps discussed with Mr Robot and what's actually happening in the real world. Okay yeah I'd love to talk about it because it's you know I think we've entered a a new we've crossed a new threshold in cyber warfare here in the last week this is an important subject and so just to kind of recount for those people who haven't been paying attention is that this week I think it was on Monday right was that Monday Monday of this week the the pagers that Hezbollah carries in Lebanon exploded like yeah 2,800 of them exploded and caused several deaths loss of limbs you know lots of injuries uh and then the very next day the walkie-talkies exploded and some solar panels exploded some TV sets exploded some laptops exploded and so this is very curious because we've never seen anything quite like this before and so you may remember viewers that a while ago David and I did a uh a video and uh hopefully David you can leave a link to it at the bottom here we did a video uh maybe a year or two ago on Mr Robot blowing up buildings yeah right so very similar right so what happened in in that particular episode of Mr Robot is that he blew up an entire building by basically hacking the firmware of the UPS's right so UPS's uninterruptable power supply the batteries that these big data centers use so every big data center draws a lot of energy and they certainly can't down so what they do is they have these big battery banks these battery banks are like room size you know they are like stad not Stadium size they're like basketball court in some case size rooms with batteries in them to be able to power these data centers if the power goes out so in that particular episode of Mr Robot what he did is he hacked the firmware and raise the voltage on the batteries the batteries is when the voltage Rises okay then they begin to leak hydrogen gas and then all it takes is some spark to set off the explosion so so when I saw this event take place this week I thought of that particular yeah um that particular episode and that's a very real possibility right that's I I don't know that's ever happened in real life but it certainly is a real possibility especially since the UPS's being part of the IoT of the world right are relatively easy to hack right those those devices they're connected to the internet right yeah and so if they're connected to the internet that means they've got a little web server out of it right and those web servers can be hacked and then once you hack the web server you can then take control of the UPS and then upload malware what have you to that particular device but this week all right we had those pages explode and then we had the other devices explode as well so let's talk a little bit about that the first question is what is a pager how do you old people like us know right right it's like who uses pagers and why right y so pagers have been around for a long long time and they've largely been superseded by cell phones in recent years mostly there have been I think actually at this point in time I think like 10% of the pagers in the world are used by NHS in Britain in there by doctors and medical personnels that largely been obsoleted in the in most applications but that's part of the reason why Hezbollah was using it okay is that cell phones are too easily hacked right and cell services are too easily hacked now you got to remember that this is you know this is war between the Palestinians and Israel and Israel is very very adept at cell phone hacking they are very they may be the best at cell phone hacking like remember that NSO group okay the the company who developed Pegasus right is a Israeli company and NSO group sells that Pegasus to basically any government who's willing to pay $20,000 per phone all right so they've sold it to governments all over the world and you can rest assured that they've also sold it to the Israeli government right so that means that cell phones are really not safe for Israel's adversaries whoever they may be right so the unit 8200 I don't your viewers may be familiar with this is the unit 8200 is a a a hacker group they Cyber attack group cyber security Cyber attack group in Israel and they're very very adept they're one of the best in the world right and they have very close ties to NSL group as well right so this is this is part of why Hezbollah and anybody else who's opposing Israel is very careful about not using cell phones for secure communication so Hezbollah decided to use pagers the older technology which is not being used very much there's very few of them around you don't see people use them they used to be very popular 20 or 30 years ago but not anymore but these these Pages blew up all at the same time I think it was 3:30 local time in uh in Lebanon and so there's at least two theories of what happened here. OTW just before you continue with us I believe one of the advantages of a pager right is that it doesn't transmit it only receives whereas a cell phone obviously transmits and receives so it's much easier to track someone on a cell phone than it is on a pager is that correct? That's correct yeah there's couple of reasons that one yeah the pager is is not a transmitting device it's simply a receiving device and also keep in mind that a cell phone is really easy to track the location so even if you didn't hack the individual phone you can easily track the individual so if if your adversary were using cell phones like in some cases you I've done so work with US Homeland Security in along the border of the US and Mexico and they use the cell phones of the cartels to track the cartel members right so that's that's pretty easy to do that's like that's pretty old school that's not that's not state-of the-art by any means because yeah every time you connect to a cell tower then it gives away your location right that's where you're at except if you're in very very rural areas and that's part of the problem that homeland security has along the Texas Mexico borders is some of that area out there is very very wide open and so the the accuracy of the cell tower signal can be as much as a half a mile um a kilometer in any a kilometer radius that's a that's pretty big area yeah if you're in an urban area they can get you down to a few feet you can you can locate you can locate some down to by by triangulating the cell tower signals you can get people down to about 50 ft it's it's very very accurate so Hezbollah or anybody else who's you know is in working in cyber War has to be careful about using cell phones you know in the Ukraine Russia War those cell phones have been used to target so one of the things it was an interesting story a year ago or so where the Ukrainians were actually on dating sites right they were on dating sites and they were conversing with Russian soldiers and they were basically the word that you know in English people use is catfishing they they put on a they put on a profile that's very attractive and you know I love you you're the greatest thing that ever was that God ever made and I really want to meet you and of course then the Russian soldiers would send pictures back and of course those pictures had xif data on them so when you take a picture with your phone it has your location on it and so and so then Ukrainians would use this to target the Russian soldiers by it so that's why they would not use okay a cell phone right so pagers aren't going to have that kind of location data on it they're not as easy to hack I mean who who was hacking pagers in 2024 nobody is because nobody's using them right Hezbollah uses these pagers and one of the one of the common techniques of spycraft okay is supply chain interruption well this is very similar to what happen say for instance even in in the Stuxnet okay in the Stuxnet attack against Iran is that the US and Israel were able to get into the supply chain of the materials that were going into the centi fuses in Iran and by getting into them they basically knew what technology was being used so they were able to know exactly what technology was going into so they didn't actually plant anything in there but they got into the supply chain and knew exactly what was going in one of the theories the one that's most experts believe is true is that Israel got into the supply chain of these pagers so they basically infiltrated their enemies and they found out that Hezbollah was ordering these pagers to avoid detection okay and they created a company all right that then sold them the pagers yeah so and you can see here on my screen a uh a diagram this is just speculation of course nobody knows right now what exactly happened but what they did is they built these pagers and they put in for one of the batteries or right next to the lithium battery they put in a small charge of C4 and by the scale of the explosions we can probably say that it was probably C4 something very close to it and so they built these pagers with malware okay just a little piece of software that basically they could trigger by a pager alert a detonator and then an explosive ch charge so all they did is sent out a page pager message that then triggered the malware and the malware triggered the detonator and then the detonator triggered the explosive charge okay so that's the most widely accepted theory of what happened there's another theory out there all right that probably has is more concerning than this because this is a very targeted attack against an enemy and it requires that you interrupt you know get inside the supply chain in this case you know and and plant a explosive inside of the device but a more in nefarious theory is that the lithium batteries within these devices was used as an explosive charge so they as you know lithium batteries can explode matter of fact let me uh let me show you a little video one of the things this is one of the theories is that mosad or whoever has figured out a way to trigger the explosion of these batteries and that would be much more nefarious because it would mean that all of our devices that have lithium batteries in them could be used as weapons right and that means that none of us are really safe if somebody can actually trigger an explosion of those devices so the one of the responses one of the negative responses to that theory is that generally the lithium batteries don't explode that but they instead just burn they start a fire but in some cases they do explode so if somebody was able to determine what the conditions were okay to make these batteries explode then every phone every laptop every solar panel could be a happen initially when it was just the pagers I think you you would have to lean towards the explanation that it was simply a supply chain attack now we have all these other devices exploding so are we to presume that mad was able to do supply chain attacks against all these other devices maybe but one of the things that we have to be concern concerned about is whether or not they've figured out a way to make those lithium batteries explode and then that becomes much more problematic. So I saw in that video OTW those um I can't remember the exact name but like the segue like scooter thing that you stand on a lot of those have been banned right because they've been exploding so there are issues with batteries um and I assume the bigger the battery you know the more likely that it's going to be a big explosion obviously. Exactly yeah there's a those scooters and a number of other devices places there's a if you look on YouTube you'll find actually a number of uh fire departments around uh for instance the New York City Fire Department has several videos showing people what can happen to scooters and what have you that they bring into their home and they have videos they have home videos of scooters exploding and they're just explaining to people this is a danger you have to be aware of this possibility so once again this is this is a theory it's not necessarily been proven by any means and a lot of people don't think it has credibility because in general the batteries don't explode but as we see under certain conditions which maybe mad has mastered that they can be made to explode and give off a lot of energy but in general what happens is that and what most people have experienced is they start on fire and they burn very very hot and you can't put the fire out with water so if you get a really really hot fire inside of a pager right it could potentially explode yeah. I think it's um I've just looked online while we were talking like a hoverboard type thing I know a lot of these have been banned and it's interesting that the you know the fire departments are showing these things explode I think so let me um let me counter some of the stuff I've seen online OTW um a lot of people are saying the um pagers couldn't explode because a lot of of them just use AA batteries or double a batteries or whatever so those batteries are too small um to have that amount of explosive capability and um like you said some of these lithium ion batteries can just heat up but they won't explode. And that's you know that's the counter to that theory is that those batteries are relatively small and you know they don't have as much energy so you know that's that's a a good argument against it I'm I'm not saying that that's not possible though right I'm saying that it's unlikely but it's not impossible and certainly the larger the battery the larger the more energy the more energy the larger explosion so I'm not I'm not advocating for any either one of these theories most experts seem to think it's a supply chain yeah uh issue but the fact that we're getting other devices exploding in Lebanon kind of argues against that possibility it argues that it seems unlikely that they could have gotten into the supply chain say of the solar panels right that are sold in in Lebanon or inside of the laptops and these are it gets a it stretches credibility when you start seeing these other devices if it was a single device then yeah okay I can see the supply chain argument but when you start talking about many the different types of devices all in Lebanon not in other places right that are being exploded and the the other question here is of course how do you set the trigger on these explosions right and if they're connected in any way shape or form to the internet the Internet of Things right if they're connected to the internet then I can communicate to them I can hack them and I can set off a series of events that possibly could get them to explode but if if it is a battery issue that is really worrisome that's really really worrisome. I think a massive worry that I just thought about is which devices do we have these days that have huge battery packs right and they get moving they move around electric cars yeah I mean if they could get access to that I mean can you imagine what they could do there. Right if you know you could make it's potentially true potentially true all right and whenever we say something's potentially true it probably is if it's potentially possible right then it's it's only a short leap from potentially possible to reality it's potentially that a Tesla or other electric vehicle could be a weapon all right of War right so those things have huge batteries in them and if if if and they're connected to the internet right and so the attacker potentially could gain access to the car and that's you that's not that that's not that hard to conceive right because hacking cars is a wellknown technology a well-known technique and once you're inside the vehicle get inside say the firmware of the battery system and then make them overheat and it's called a thermal runaway where these lithium batteries will just start they'll just get really really hot and then burn and explode that size of a battery in a vehicle is really really large and a lot of energy would be released um. So OTW just so that we don't get um told that we spreading Mis information I'll just say this on online now I'm on the dw.com which is I think believe a German um website a newspaper website they saying that um iPhones exploding in Lebanon that's false they say fact checked fact check should I say and then um solar panels false and then laptops exploding they also say it's false um I'm assuming I mean there's so like we've discussed offline there's so much information out there a lot of this is developing at the time of this recording that we not sure exactly what devices are are exploding but we definitely know it's pagers and walkie-talkies right? Right that's what we know for that's what you know for pro a high level of certainty I see uh I'm seeing some articles from Hind just on times the times of India that talk about the solar panels but here's ABC News that's pretty reliable okay um let's see what ABC news says in the US this ABC is considered to be a old school media that's facts checks okay so here's. That looks very reliable right I mean it's it's like all things you you got to you got to you got to wait until it's confirmed by whatever news source that you trust but it's I mean that I'm glad that you're showing that because that says the opposite of what um this other article said that I found. But this is also two days old right and so there may be better information right now but this is lebanon's national news agency says the solar panels did explode there may be better information two days later than was available at the time of this but in any case it's there's also reports of laptops now whether or not that is real we don't really know okay so there's there's a lot of a lot of misinformation available on the web there's lots of great information available on the internet but you have to take everything with a grain of salt because there's a lot of people online who want to spread misinformation all right and they want to sew um division so you got to always fact check just about everything that you see online. But I think let's go back to the technical stuff right it's okay it's sounds at the moment from what I've seen online the most plausible explanation is the um supply chain right um where they inserted exposes use this fake company I think it was in Hungary if I remember right um Taiwanese company. uh a a contractor to a to a Taiwanese company they purchased a license to make the the pagers. I mean the one that I always remember is the one where the NSA uh was um opening up Cisco routers and inserting stuff in the supply chain there and shipping them off so there was like stuff embedded in the Cisco routers that's an old one I mean the um the one that you mentioned with the Iran um stuxnet is another example so this stuff goes on all the time I think this is just I think for a lot of people really scary because so many devices exploded at the same time and you know it it wasn't just like one entity it was like a whole bunch of people that were affected by it um so yeah quite scary that um but I understand your your push back on that as well is like if it's other devices that are exploding then it's um it seems like they would have had to get into a lot of supply chains and if they managed to get into you know doing something with batteries that's really worrying. If they got into if they figured out how to make those batteries explode then that's very concerning because there's we have these lithium batteries in all of our devices right now I would say that that probably has a really low probability of being accurate okay so let's be clear it's a low probability that's accurate but if it is accurate then that's really concerning so we'll just have to keep on evaluating as more information comes in right now the consensus seems to be that this is a supply chain attack so let's be clear on that the consensus of experts is that this is a supply chain attack so it isn't going to necessarily affect you and I unless we're hisbah members but but if if they figured out how to make the batteries explode which I think even if they didn't figure out how to make batteries explode I think that's a really feasible attack vector right in the future. It's worrying right because our lives I mean whenever I talk to you and lots of other experts it's it's it's like scary you want to go back and live in a cave because so many of us are carrying so many electronic devices I mean you're getting hacked you can get hacked by the internet cuz all these devices are connected what I really find worrying is cars where electrical electric cars sorry are going to be connected to the internet 24/7 and um uh I interviewed Sam Curry in the past who managed to hack like all kinds of cars like Ferraris BMWs Mercedes like almost any brand that you can think of he managed to hack with these with his with his friends um it's um it's really worrying that everything's connected and can be hacked more or more it seems. Right right and and I think we have to live with the reality in a digital Advanced Digital World that everything is hackable let's that's stated it very clearly everything is hackable and this potential attack against batteries is very very worrisome if that would be that would mean that every one of our devices a is a potential weapon we we do know that all of our devices our cell phones and what have you are all hackable with Pegasus for instance right that that's a very real thing so how big of a leap is it from Pegasus to another piece of malware that manipulates the firmware in the phone to detonate the battery yeah you it's I don't think it's a big leap it's one we should be worried about but I'm not gonna go live in a cave maybe you can go live in a cave but I'm not gonna go live in a cave I kind of I kind of like living in my home uh but uh yeah maybe if you go live in a cave you still take your cell phone with you what does that help you yeah that's not going to help any case I think this is something that's really is interesting it's something that we need to uh track and watch we may have leaped across a new threshold and cyber warfare techniques but I would say to kind of sum up that the consensus among experts is this is a supply chain attack so let's be clear on that but if it's a battery attack right which I think is very possible maybe not this one but in the future right that that would be really really scary and much more malicious and endanger everybody to a much greater extent than say a targeted supply chain attack like we saw here. OTW I really appreciate you sharing what I love about what you do is you don't just share like really technical stuff you also do the storytelling piece and explain you know what's happening in the in the world from a hackers perspective as always thanks so much for sharing and just for everyone who's watching I've put links to otw's website below and OTW I have to ask you you you're giving a cool discount right on your website.

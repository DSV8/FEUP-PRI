    "description": "I've wanted to get behind the wheel of a Chevy Bolt EV for a long time. Last year I had the chance to test drive the Volt, Chevrolets half-electric Plug-In Hybrid, and before that I spent some time getting to know Tesla's Model X and Model S to see what the hip and expensive side of electric cars was all about. Today, I finally get to experience American-standard Chevrolet's take on the fully-electric automobile. Join me as I test-drive the Chevy Bolt 2017, the vehicle that Chevrolet promises will \"reinvent\" the electric car  and stay tuned for my full Chevy Bolt 2017 review, later in the year!   [SUBSCRIBE]     [ABOUT THE CHEVY BOLT 2017 TEST DRIVE]  MrMobile's Chevy Bolt 2017 test drive was produced following five hours with a Chevy Bolt EV loaned by Chevy (Premium trim level). The full Chevy Bolt 2017 review will arrive later in the year; until that time, MrMobile's conclusions concerning the quality of the vehicle should be considered in-development. There is no buy/don't buy recommendation at presstime.

    "transcript": "- Last fall, I reviewed the Chevy Volt. A plug-in hybrid that takes you about 50 miles on electric power before switching to a gasoline powered range extender. Well this week, I got a glimpse at the Volt's more futuristic sibling, this is the Bolt. Or, more properly, the Chevy Bolt EV. A crossover with enough range, power, and features to make you almost forget that it's 100% electric. I'm Mr. Mobile and I spent a few hours Bolting around Boston. Join me for a test drive. I feel like I've got to say upfront that I don't think this design will be for everyone. The Bolt EV is a curious little car that Chevy calls a crossover, the EPA calls a small wagon, and I call a type-6 shuttle craft. But, there are benefits to the tallish design. For one thing, higher ceilings mean you won't bash your head as often getting into the cabin, if you're on the tall side. Also, there's a real center seat in the back row now, instead of the Volt's infant version. And you've got 56 cubic feet of cargo space around back. At least, you do once you fold down the back seats. And there's also an additional compartment beneath the floor, that I didn't discover until after my test drive. Up front, the spacious feeling gets a further boost from a floating center console, which adds to the subtle sense that you're in some futuristic spacecraft. Now, I say subtle because Chevy doesn't go overboard here. The cabin is still firmly rooted in practicality with physical buttons for many functions and an undersized shifter, that only takes a little while to get used to. Same goes for the button studded steering wheel, which is the same one from the Volt. Give it a few hours and you'll know what most of the controls do. There's a refreshing surprise on the head unit too. The software running on that 10.2 inch display is not the UI train wreck of most cars. It's actually responsive and intuitive. With Android Auto and Apple CarPlay available, if you want to plug your phone in. Now, this is the high end review model of the Volt EV, so, I didn't have time to test all the features like parking assist, and lane keeping, and so on. But, I did thoroughly enjoy the heated seats and steering wheel, when filming on a damp and cold New England afternoon. Other favorites from the Volt also appear here. Like the proximity warning lights that keep an eye on your blind spots. But, my favorite feature is one I haven't seen before. Something Chevy calls surround vision. Here's how it works, you shift into reverse, and in addition to the backup camera, you get a blended view of four separate cameras, located around the car, to create this kind of birds eye 360 degree view. It's almost like your own personal drone is following your car around. This is not a Chevy exclusive. Apparently, it started showing up in cars over a year ago. But, the Bolt EV is my first exposure to it. It's like my new favorite thing, as far as driving assist features go. Let's talk about driving. Cruising around in the Bolt EV feels much like driving any other midsize car. Except this one has the instant torque of an electric drive. Having all that power available in an instant makes quick merging a lot easier. And it's also just fun to go from zero to the speed limit in two or three seconds. The biggest difference you're going to see, if you're coming from a conventional car, is an optional one, it's if you enable one pedal driving. In this mode, regenerative breaking will kick in as soon as you take your foot off the gas. So, it feels almost like you're driving with the parking brake half on. While it takes some getting used to, it has the benefit of saving wear and tear on your brakes and it sends a little juice back into the battery every time you decelerate. That helps pad out the car's range somewhat, which Chevy pegs at an estimated 238 miles between charges. That's almost five times as far as the volt can go on electric power. And it's also a few mile more than what Tesla promises for the Model 3. That's estimated mileage though. I won't be able to speak to real world usage until the full review, later this season. The same goes for an overall value score. I think the Bolt EV is reasonably priced, for an electric car. But electrics are still pricey wheels, even after tax benefits. Battery charging, On Star, Wi-Fi hotspots, handling, cabin comfort, cup holders, and much more, in the full Chevy Bolt EV review coming soon. To make sure you don't miss it, subscribe to Mr. Mobile on YouTube, follow me on Facebook, and let me know what you want to know about the Bolt EV, down in the comments. Until next time, thanks to Chevy for the quick look. Thanks to you for watching and stay mobile my friends. Going my way?",

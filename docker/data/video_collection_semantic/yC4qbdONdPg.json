    "transcript": "- Hello my friends and welcome to This Is. CES is a momentous occasion. And hi Zach. - I have no idea what we're talking about. (Austin and Zach laugh) - We're out here looking for the weirdest, the wackiest, and we found Zach from JerryRigEverything. - I literally just walked up. - Zach, what's the weirdest thing you've seen so far? - Shoot, I've only been to like two booths, so you guys. That would be it. - Let's go find some wackiness. CES is a magical place. There are so many things that fill you with wonderment and delight. Matt and I have decided to look at none of those and instead some of the more interesting items. - Sometimes when you're out on the open waters you feel like maybe your life preserver's a little sus. Well, it's about to get susser. (low horror sting) We have the U Safe. Do you feel like you're not safe when you have a flotation device? Well, thanks to this, you safe. (suspicious music) - One of the very first things I ever did with VR was do a roller coaster ride. But the problem is that that's just a visual experience and we're hands on learners. Matt, ready to go to the Metaverse? This my friends, is the Selcos. This is a VR experience that will blow wind at you and actually give you a full motion ride. Matt and I have a few hours here on the show floor and most of these things are like an hour plus wait. So we're living vicariously, just like you are by watching a YouTube video about CES. It looks like it's on a rollercoaster demo. Four fans and a full motion pedestal. So I'm assuming that as you're going up and down, you're going to be feeling the wind. Matt, do you like roller coasters? - [Matt] I (beep) with them. (Austin laughs) - Boy, I've seen the future and I like it. Matt, we've found the future. What are your thoughts? - [Matt] It's a lot safer, I think, than maybe the real rollercoaster. - You overestimate motion capture technology. - Ken and I are just exploring a little bit and we've come across the gallery of flops. You got your standard stuff you got like the Pippin, the N-Gage. We want to add one edition to the gallery of flops. It's where he belongs. - [Austin] Hey guys. - Hey, I found a dog that's mechanical. This is terrifying, that it's just walking around the middle of the show floor and he's very playful. (robot barks) Oh, oh, he's skittish. Oh my god. (robot whimpers) I like the little foot taps. Oh, he did it. Hi buddy. Hello. Oh god. (robot barks) Hi. Okay. He apparently likes pets. Yeah, you good? Okay. Hello. Hi. (robot yaps) Yeah, he's over me. Turn around. (robot barks) Okay. Yeah. Well, I think Nibbler still has a job as my dog, but that thing is really cool. So here we found the John Deere booth, where we just have an absolutely enormous tractor, which I'm about to try and buy. - What? Wait, what? - So I can finally get into farmersonly.com. I'm gonna find me a wife today. This is massive. And then there's definitely a compensation going on here, as it extends out just forever. Everyone knows that I am about six seven, all right? - What are those? - I am probably the tallest person in the Overclock office. And you see these Michelin tires here. These have to be 10 feet tall. I'll let you guys judge, but me being the tallest person here and then this taller than me, I don't know what to do about this. (ringtone chimes) Wait, wait. Just got my first match on farmersonly.com. - So while nothing can match the fury and speed of Matt's 1989 Ford Focus, (car horn beeps) but this might be a close second. This my friends is Vinfast. You want a Vinfast? - [Matt] I don't know what it is. Tell me about it. - Well, I wanna go take a look. I don't know, I've never seen one. I've heard of it. - Let's go look. I'm very curious to see what's on the inside. 'Cause they've got like fairly small like sort of fronts. Matt, would you like to join me inside the Vinfast? All right, let's take a look at what we've got here. So on the inside, what you've got is a very large display, which looks certainly like a certain other display that I've seen on some electric vehicles. But you can see you've got your car settings here. You've got your map on this side. You've got both CarPlay as well as Android Auto. I'm curious to see what it looks like in the back though. Wow, what an incredible vehicle. I'm amazed. It's so fast. If I'm gonna take a guess, I'm gonna say that this is gonna be something that you will be very familiar with in a couple of years. These guys seem pretty serious. And importantly, they actually have cars. I feel like a lot of electric car companies, they start selling you on stuff, but they don't actually have anything. - [Matt] They never get out the garage. - No. - [Matt] That, what, what? - Matt, do you ever fly? - [Matt] Occasionally, I've been known to fly. - It's a big airport. The planes go vroom. I mean woo. So there's robots. Hello, welcome to the security robot. He's going to escort you off the premises. It's time to go to Korea. I'm ready. Let's go. - So back here, we have one of the biggest backhoes I've ever seen, second only to your mom. - [Austin] That's a dump truck. - Is it dump truck? - [Austin] That's literally what it is, yeah. - This, ah, it's a dump truck. I said the wrong thing. I won't correct myself. - I dunno know why you said backhoe. This made no sense. - It's true, it's true. I guess I don't know my hoes that well. (faint drum roll) - [Austin] Where are we going Matt? - We are going in the boring tunnel, which as the name implies is made of Teslas. All right. (melancholy music) - And they ask you how you are and you just have to say that you're fine, when you're not really fine-- - [Matt] Oh my god, is that Austin Evans? What do you got there? - Hey guys. - Oh, that is, oh, it's just Ken. Have you ever wondered it was like to walk around in a mech, while being massaged, because that's what we got over here. Your legs are in their individual, I don't know, pants. Let's get a closer look here, shall we? Tell me this doesn't look like a mechanical Among Us suit that you're just in, that's slowly massaging you. - [Austin] Yeah, I'm kind of down with that. - [Matt] Imagine these just walking towards you, these pods. These look really cool. I want one of them for my house. If we see something called Body Friend, you know on This Is we're gonna come over and make friends with it. - [Austin] So why does this guy have that like one pose from the meme? (strange computer jangling) - I was told that you love hugs. - [Sloth] Okay, yeah. Sure, bring it in. Yeah. - [Voiceover] Bruh, look at this dude. (hysterical laughter) - Do you have a pool here? - Our pool is located on the rooftop deck. - How tall are you? - [Austin] He ain't gonna say it. - I'm either very tall or very short. - What? - What? (Austin laughs) (energetic video game music) - What time do you get off of work? (Austin sniggers) - I get off work at 6:30, but sometimes I work late. - You wanna get a drink after this? - Yes. - [Matt] What? - [Virtual Assistant] I would love a warm Americano. - What? - [Austin] This is the CES classic, dude. Look, he's there. - [Distant Voice] Thighs. - Anyone want a selfie with Austin Evans? Get a selfie with Austin Evans. Anyone? Anyone want a selfie with Austin Evans? Not one person? No?",

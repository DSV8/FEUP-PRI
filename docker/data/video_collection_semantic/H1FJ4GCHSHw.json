    "transcript": "- So, Apple just dropped brand new MacBook Pros this month, but what would MacBook Pro launch be without the perfect MacBook setup? (uplifting ambient music) So, the desk is the Rigastahd, Rigastad? Riga-stad? From Ikea. Like usual, I am butchering that name, so if I am wrong, please, please correct me. So this desk, strangely enough, I actually found outside of the office and desk section in Ikea. For whatever reason, I've had a ton of luck finding really, really cool desks in the dining section. This guy's got a nice, stealthy black look to it, it's clean, it's minimal, it's something you don't normally see every day with a desk. It has six legs. Now, because the desk is so stealthy and so minimal, I kind of wanted to follow suit with that for the rest of the setup. The plan here is space gray tech that compliments the desk and then not throwing on a ton of crap that you don't need. Now, for the MacBook Pro, this is the brand new 13 inch space gray touch bar model and the outside, nothing has changed from last year's MacBook Pro but on the inside, there's actually a pretty respectable performance jump. What I think I like most about the setup, though, is between the MacBook Pro and the HP ENVY monitor, there is one single cable. Not only is the MacBook Pro sending video to the monitor, the monitor is actually sending power to the MacBook Pro and charging it. To take things even further, though, on top of the video and on top of the power, there is also data passed through between the MacBook Pro and the monitor, so naturally, I had to include the classic mounting external SSD to the back of the monitor method. In this case, what it does is it gives me instant additional storage for the MacBook Pro and in this case, two terabytes and the beautiful part about this is everything's connected to that one single USB-C cable. Now, as far as the HP ENVY monitor, yes, this is a big, beautiful 34 inch ultra wide display. It is quad HD, it is crisp, it is vibrant, it is beautiful, but what I was most excited about was the fact that there are built in Bang and Olufsen speakers right into the monitor and I was curious if these could actually replace desktop speakers. Now, before I jump into the sound test, one thing I noticed immediately is if you are using this with a Mac, make sure you go in settings and select audio over USB as opposed to display port. Right now, it is set to display port and if you notice, nothing happens with the volume, which sucks. But if I hop over to USB, I get that sweet, sweet control through the keyboard in Mac OS. - Yes! - So, jumping into the sound test, we got a fresh track from Whitney Myer, you guys really dug the DJ Khaled cover from last HomePod video. This time, we got some Calvin Harris Feels which is a great song by itself. Let's see how this monitor sounds. (bouncy pop music) That is damn impressive considering it is coming from a screen. I think the fact that it is curved kind of gives you almost a surround feel, not only with the display but the actual sound as well. So, Bang and Olufsen, good job. So, moving on, without a doubt, the element that takes this setup over the top has to be that custom space gray Apple keyboard and track pad from Colorware. As many of you know, with the announcement of the iMac Pro alongside that comes a beautiful space gray keyboard, track pad, and mouse but the downside is Apple's not gonna sell that separately. Fortunately, though, Colorware is not about that life and can bring space gray to the masses. If you look closely at these, the detail is amazing, it looks as if it were from Apple and even though in this case this is the regular wireless Apple keyboard but I'm sure Colorware is gonna do the same thing with that new full size wireless one as well. Now, rounding out the setup and going over these smaller accessories that kinda glue everything together, the MacBook Pro is sitting on a beautiful space gray stand from Rain. The build quality is phenomenal, it has looks to match, I have been a fan of Rain for a really long time and in this case, it is no different. Next to the monitor we of course have the patented Tech YouTuber fake plant from Ikea. If you don't have one, make sure you pick one up today. Next to that is the Bose SoundLink Color Bluetooth speaker in soft black. Space gray. I initially picked this up more so as a backup 'cause I wasn't really sure if the speakers on the monitor would be enough but that clearly proved me wrong. In this case, though, you now have a space gray speaker that perfectly matches your setup and is something cool you can take on the go. Now last up is that giant Mario Banksy's canvas behind me, I actually first featured this in my custom Nintendo Switch desk setup but since then, I've gotten a ton of questions on what it is, where can I get it. I thought it looked great here as well, so I thought I would feature it and answer that question for you guys. Along with that and everything else featured in this video, I of course will link everything down below. So, that is my 2017 perfect MacBook Pro setup. Hopefully you enjoyed the video, if you did and you're feeling like being awesome, make sure to drop a like down below. But maybe Mac isn't your thing and you're looking for a Windows setup... - So, the Microsoft Surface laptop just came out this week and when I saw the beautiful burgundy colored one, I just knew it needed a setup.

    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going. Dave 2d here. So today we're talking about the iPad Pro. This is a device that looks awesome in videos and photos on Apple's website. This thing is a really well-built piece of technology. It's an engineering marvel. It looks amazing. But my question that I have every single year when the iPad comes out is can this thing be used as a laptop replacement? Because that's the thing I'm most interested in. I like having tech but I like having less tech, and being able to have something that does all of the stuff I would need to do as well as being a tablet for media consumption would be great. And that's the thing: when you look at this device, you can tell it's immediately one of the best - if not the best - media consumption devices on the market. It has a beautiful screen. This one's the 11 inch model, but it's a 120 Hertz screen, colors look really good, it gets bright... It's a fantastic screen. The speaker is also great for media consumption: loud, really clean. I don't know how they do this every year, they make these speakers a little bit better. But they're really good for both music and video, and also for audio in games. It's also a great device for creatives, for people that use the Apple Pencil. It's got very low latency, there's a bunch of great apps for it. And this year the Apple Pencil has wireless charging and a magnetic connection onto the iPad itself. It honestly makes the old Apple Pencil feel really silly. Like the way this one used to charge was just stupid. But whether or not this device can be used to replace your laptop, that is a more important question. And obviously if you're a light user, like if all you do is just like email, browse the web... Sure. The answer is yes. It's a very obvious yes. But for people that are just doing a little bit more - and I'm not talking like video editing and development and stuff like that. I'm just talking about people that want to replace a laptop with this. So instead of buying a thousand dollar laptop or $1200 laptop, you spend that money on this device. And for that money you are getting some new features this year. The new USB-C port brings some charging convenience, which is nice, and you can connect it to an external display, which for some people is really useful, and the new face ID works very well. But one of the more impressive features about the iPad Pro this year is the performance. This thing is incredibly fast. The thing is, if you think about iPads in general, like when was the last time - if you've used an iPad in the past or anybody who's used an iPad in the past - when was the last time they looked at their old device and thought \"I wish this was faster. Like I'm being held back by this speed of my three-year-old iPad\". Like that's just not a thing for most people. That is not... That should not be the focus of Apple's iPad development. What we're missing is software. I'm not talking about apps, I'm talking about the OS. This operating system holds the iPad pro buck I really feel like the OS needs a full overhaul and every year all the reviewers say this like, you know it's great hardware held back by the software, but it's like like if we could take this one the 2015 iPad pro this is a three year old device if we could take this machine and Put a filesystem on there like a traditional filesystem and some kind of like cursor or Mouse support. Everybody would be using this instead of the new 2018 superfast iPad pro without all of that stuff and I feel like this is an issue that has existed since the very beginning of the iPad like the Moment some company out there made that first third-party keyboard that could connect by bluetooth to the first iPad That's when people start to look at these things as a potential laptop replacement six years later We're still in the exact same situation where it's great hardware, but it's held back by software and this year It's even more frustrating because the hardware so darn good. It looks good performs Well, it's just an incredible piece of hardware But there's so few people that can actually use this as a laptop replacement the USB C port doesn't support external storage There is no headphone jack and the lack of a proper Filesystem on here just makes it really difficult to interact with files you get over email or just through any kind of workflow It's a very cool device But it's just too expensive to be some kind of fun secondary device and to me this still isn't a laptop replacement I want it to be because it looks so good But there's so many little things that hold it back constantly that just prevents it from being a truly viable laptop replacement It's a good laptop alternative like as a secondary device, but so was the Three-year old one like I don't feel like there's a fundamental difference in terms of usability Between the two obviously this new one looks better but the biggest difference is speed. This is so much faster But like I said speed is not holding this thing back. It's the software, okay Hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs. If you liked it subs we'd love to see you guys next time",

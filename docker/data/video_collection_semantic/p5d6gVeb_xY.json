    "transcript": "(lively music) - Hello and welcome to Vergecast, the flagship podcast of massive base, ultimate vibe. - [David] Oh no. - We're immediately starting there. Hi, I'm your friend Nilay. Alex Cranz is here. - I'm your friend who just discovered Arc. - The browser? - Very excited. - Yeah, nobody told me about it. David definitely has repeatedly. - Every issue of installer is like, \"Have you used this browser?\" - Turns out he's right, who knew? - David Pierce is also here, although is he? - I just, you say ultimate base and I just wanna leave. I just immediately know where we're going. - Oh, we're driving that car there so fast. All right, here's what I wanna tell you. It's a huge week of news, a bunch of docs about how Google Search works leaked and then they were confirmed to be real. I don't wanna oversell, this is on the order of how the Facebook algorithm works. Like this is true insight into the Google Search algorithm. So you gotta talk about that and the fallout across the web from that. Google Search continues to be bananas. There's a bunch of OpenAI news. I know people want us to talk about Vox Media's deal with OpenAI, which I will to whatever extent that is interesting. Then we got a lightning round unsponsored. - For now. - Sam. But there's one piece of news that I think dominates the week. - [Alex] You definitely think it dominates the week. - And that is The Verge has received a review unit of the Sony FIELD 7 ULT speaker. - It's enormous. - This is a medium sized one. - It's so big. - If you're not watching this on YouTube, just imagine Nilay pulled a grenade launcher out from underneath the table. - I love it so much. It's 399 and as as many of you know, I think the internet has eras and I think technology has eras. We've talked a lot about the end of the Google Search era on the internet. What that might mean. Perhaps with the dawn of the AI era. Certainly we were in the mobile era for quite a long time. The social era, this is the ULT era. And what I mean by that is if the eighties were dominated by megabass in the nineties were dominated by megabass, I would say that the twenties, the two thousands, 2010s kind of a stumble through Sony's EXTRA BASS era. - Yeah, it wasn't pleasant. - There was no- - You know, it didn't hit. We're now in what Sony has called the ULT era. - Ooh, I like these handles. - That's what the button says on it right here, ULT. - There's a ULT button? Wait, that changes everything. - There's a ULT button. - It lights up. - I'm just gonna turn this guy on here, it's so big. There we go. - I in fact can't see Nilay through the speaker. - I'm told that if I hold this play button down for five seconds, we get royalty free demo music. You hear that YouTube? Royalty free. - And you guys can't see the lights, but they're there. - There she goes. Now, I don't know if you can see the amount of the speaker that's currently lit up, but it's both drivers. And then on the front, the ULT button is rainbow blinking. And when you push that, you get massive bass, ultimate vibe. This is the most important product in technology. - Do you think if you press the ULT button right now, the podcast would explode? - Let's find out. Wait, you gotta wait for the drop to come back. You're gonna rule this place Is this English? - It's singlish. - Oh, there's another song. Oh yeah. Oh, it got so much quieter when I pushed the ULT button. Does it just, it just makes little drum hits when you push the ULT. Can you hear that? - Yeah. - It's like a timpani. I don't know man. Like I'm trying to sell this and it's not going great. - The handles are great. We're turning into QVC or TikTok. This is on our TikTok store right now. - We do have a good handle. - For $400. - It won't burn down your house - That we know of. - Yeah. - Anyway, look, all I'm saying is we went from the megabass era to the EXTRA BASS era, which again, I think was a failure. I don't- - I mean the ULT era is not bumping so far. - Well it's just- - I mean, the first song is good. - EXTRA is not more than mega. And so what happened is in the mega era, everybody went deaf and so couldn't hear the EXTRA era. So, but now we have Ultimate, which all the deaf people in their forties can hear now. So it's back. - It look, it has powerful sound with an X-Balanced Speaker unit and 30 hours of battery life. - It doesn't make the Windows rattle though. Is it really bass? - I just think it's funny when you try to make a spec sheet for a product that is insane and you're just like, RGB lights next to a bullet point. Look, it's the ULT era. I've never been more excited about a product in my entire life. That's the Vergecast, everybody. - People have been wondering about when we're gonna give a 10 outta 10 and I think it might be happening it might be time. - By the way, this is the medium sized one. - Oh my god. - This is the seven. There's also a 10. I cannot wait for that one to arrive. They also sent us two sevens. Chris Welch just has one in his house. Taking up most of his home. I'd like to formally apologize to everyone for bringing the ULT FIELD 7 on the show. And by apologize I mean, I'm sorry if you felt bad. I felt great. All right, let's talk about the news. That's what I've learned about apologies. Soon I'll be taking a screenshot of Notes app. - I'm really excited for that. - I'm headed directly for that in everyone's career, you are like, \"Is this the screenshot of Notes app?\" - Yeah. - Let's find out. Okay, let's talk about the news. There's a lot of news. A lot of it is about AI and what it is doing to the internet. If you've been listening to our show or reading The Verge or listening to Decoder, whatever, you know that we've had a thesis for a while now, stretching back into the middle of last year that the internet was about to get flipped over. Not just by AI but by search in general, by social platforms falling apart. I dunno if you're aware, they changed the name from Twitter to X, like something's happening. - Yeah. - And one thing that we really wanted to do was pay a lot of attention to what things were like now so we could properly describe how they changed, which meant we did a lot of SEO coverage last year. Covered the culture of SEO, the community of SEO, why the web looks like an SEO disaster. How Google fights back against SEO. Mia Sato did a lot of that reporting for us. I think I've radicalized her, like you make someone care about SEO for eight months. They come out a different person on the other side. But Mia's done a great job of that reporting. We had a great feature from Amanda Chicago Lewis. The SEO community is still mad about, that featured an alligator party. We will link all this up, you can read it. The point I'm trying to make is we felt like it was changing. I think that hunch was correct, right? - Yeah I mean, Google kind of sucks now. I'm using Kagi. - So Google sucks now. Right, there's other search products. Google's rolling out AI Overviews. And then over the long weekend a bunch of SEO people discovered that the API documentation for Google Search had been inadvertently made public on GitHub for quite some time. And there were a couple blog posts, one that was just like, \"Here's how I found it, here's who showed it to me.\" That one's really interesting. And then there's another one that's more of a deep dive into here's what it says. And then there was a little bit of back and forth about is this real? Like can we trust what we're seeing? Because some of what the documentation revealed is that Google has not been telling the whole truth about how search works for a very, very long time. And so some of the headlines in these posts are like, \"Is Google lying to us?\" And some of the copy in these posts is like, \"Google has been lying to us.\" Google was initially just totally dead silent, which is weird. Like usually we at least get a no comment. But Mia sent a bunch of emails, we sent some texts, \"Hey, is there anything? Do you want to deny that this is real?\" Dead silence. Then yesterday, Wednesday, Google confirmed the leaks. They said, \"This is real.\" And they said, \"We would caution against making inaccurate assumptions about search based on out of context and incomplete information.\" Basically they're saying, \"Yeah, this is real. But no, no, it's not super real.\" It's a lot. David, you have been covering search and how it works and thinking about it. You use the most browsers and search engines of anyone I know. There's some real explosive information here, but it's still not clear how much we should take seriously and how much Google is lying. It's just a lot of angry people are suddenly like, \"Oh, this is what I've been angry about.\" - Yeah, it's a weird moment because Google Search has always been a black box. Google has very deliberately not revealed how Google Search works and what it cares about. In part because it's so complicated that it's actually a hard, borderline impossible thing to sit down and explain to somebody why something is where it is in search results. Like I don't think any individual person at Google knows the answer to that question. It's just not how the system works anymore. But also because the more Google reveals about how search works, the more tools it is giving people with which to game Google Search, which has been the cat and mouse game, they've been playing forever. And so what has been happening is people have been asking Google what is going on? What systems and rankings does Google care about? What can I do to make my stuff rank higher in Google Search? And Google has given a lot of answers that these 2,500 pages of internal API documents say are essentially not true. Like there are a series of things that Google has in these documents that it has explicitly said out loud it does not consider in search ranking. Are those two statements completely mutually exclusive? No, which is why this gets so weird, right? Like there are, I forget the exact number, but it was right around 14,000 individual things referenced in these pages, which is basically like 14,000 different signals. How those are ranked which matter more, which matter less, whether they're all even counted, how old this information is, what some of the terms actually mean. Very hard to know because a lot of them are terms we've never seen before that Google has been saying for years didn't exist. But what seems to be true is you don't have a heading in your API for a thing that you don't care about. And so for things that Google has for years said that it doesn't care about, there is now evidence that it is at least a piece of data that Google collects. And one of the wild things is that people who do SEO spend a lot of time testing theories and they've been testing theories, and people like the guy who broke the story, Rand Fishkin, have gotten crap from people in the community for running tests and saying things like, \"Oh, it seems like Google Search really cares about click-through rates. And people at Google saying, \"No, no, no, no, we don't care about click-through rates. You're an idiot.\" And this overwhelmingly makes it look like Google cares an awful lot about click-through rates. And so now we're in this place where I think a big part of what we've been seeing from the SEO community is people who are like, \"Oh, not only has Google not been telling us the truth, they've been lying to our faces and making it, like gaslighting us into believing the wrong thing about how Google Search works.\" And it's a weird, like existential crisis when that happens. - And the thing I'll just like try to chain together is we started paying attention to this story last year. 'Cause we wanted to know what this ecosystem was like. - Right. - Like we wanted a picture of maybe like the last days of disco, right? Like here's what it was like before the comet hits. And I thought the comet would be AI or the end of social networks or Google keeping more traffic inside a featured whatever the comet is. And it kind of feels like the comet is actually just knowing that Google wasn't telling the whole truth, right? Like the headings in these blog posts, like legitimately there's a trade publication called Search Engine Land that we've been watching a lot of the coverage of this on that site. It's one of the bigger SEO trade publications to exist. And the headings are like, \"How does SEO move on from here?\" One of the subheadings in their piece where they run the Google statement was, \"Did Google lie to us?\" That's just a subheading, that's just a straight H2 on their story. - Which by the way people do in order to be ranked higher in Google. And you put questions people might Google in an H2 I'm serious, right? And that is like push this all the way down and it's like what's inside this document is how the internet works, right? Like people have built the internet to try to figure out how to game the stuff that is inside these 2,500 pages. And like you can reverse engineer the internet out of Google's API, which I think is why this feels so huge. Like your point about the Facebook algorithm that you've been saying all week, like this is on the order of leaking the Facebook algorithm, like it is. And in the way that understanding the Facebook algorithm would essentially help us understand a decade of our online relationships. Like this is the internet in 2,500 pages of like weird inscrutable API calls. - [Alex] And I think that's hard for people who aren't in the SEO business or our business, which is kind of the SEO business to fully wrap their heads around. - We make websites, if you make a website, you care about this a little bit. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah, we have to, right? Like it's required. I edit buying guides. I have to care a lot about SEO and people who don't care about SEO, they like, I go and I tell my friends, I'm like, \"This huge document, like cash of documents dropped, this is huge.\" And they're like, \"Why are you, what is SEO?\" - Elon Musk says I'm gonna open source the Twitter algorithm and this is front page news. The API calls, or fields basically of what data Google collects to run a ranking algorithm leaks, and it's like us like freaking out. - Yeah. - And it's kind of nowhere. And I, and like to David's point, we don't know how these things are ranked. - That's true. - But we do know that Google has said for years it does not collect some of this data or care about some of this data, and it definitely does. What you gonna do with that? Rand Fishkin, the same person you mentioned, David has spent a long time saying it seems like that this thing called dwell time is important. So you click through a Google result, you land on a website, you're there for however long, you come back to Google, you go to the next one, that time you spend on the website. He's like, \"That seems important.\" And Google has basically said, no. Yep. They're tracking that too. - Yeah. - The one that I think is the most explosive, which we don't really know how to understand, is click data from Chrome and it's there somewhere, right? So one thing we know that Google does, which is a little shaky, is when you search for a website, I think the example that came out in one of the antitrust trials was Vogue or Cosmopolitan. It was some magazine like this. - Yeah, it was one of those, yeah. - And you get the website and right below it in the search result, you get their headings like beauty, fashion, style coverage, Met Gala. Those headings are generated by what people click on in those websites and Chrome. - Yeah. - And Google has forever said it does not use data from Chrome to impact search. And then you look at these API docs and you're like, \"Oh, it's in there's data from Chrome.\" Like it's potential that Google is actually using that for search. And they have sworn up and down to every regulator, to every SEO professional, to everyone that these things are not the same. What are you gonna do with that? - It's such a funny example too because like of course Google does that. Like this to me, so much of this leak is things that you would obviously assume Google is doing except that Google has been denying doing it for years. That it turns out, in fact Google is doing. Like I'm in the business of knowing which links are good. And I also run a browser in which billions of people click links every day. Like at some point you'd be insane not to let one affect the other. You have maybe the best possible data stream, which is the links that people go to and how long they spend there, which is literally, that is all you could ever want to know in search rankings. And so the idea that they are spread apart and not, you know, in any way correlated out of the goodness of Google's heart, I think has always been sort of silly to people. And so to some extent it's like, it just confirms what your instincts tell you in a lot of this league. - Yeah. - Yeah. I keep going back to Nilay earlier, you said this was kinda like a comet hitting, and I feel like it's definitely a comet for the SEO community, but for the rest of us, we've kind of been in more like high waters rising as apocalypse it's going, right? Like the Google experience for 90% of people has just been like, \"Okay, the sea levels are rising now.\" And it feels like this was maybe that big push in the water. \"Oh, now it's covering Manhattans, dang it.\" - Yeah. Yeah I mean, it does feel like the dam is breaking. One of the things that we were talking about when we did our decoder episode recently about Google Zero was this stuff leaks 'cause people are mad. - Yeah. - And so if you were an SEO operator and you uncovered a bunch of secret data that Google was collecting, you would not tell the SEO community, right? Like you would definitely keep that to yourself. But instead what's happening is people are mad and they're like, \"Look at all these lies or look at what we perceive to be lies.\" - Yeah. - And there's just a lot of the ideas that people have had about how Google Search works, one of them is domain authority. So a very funny thing that happens is every year I publish Best Printer 2024 by a Brother laser printer and it goes to the top of the rankings, it goes to the top of the search rankings. One, because I have the right answer, which is you should buy a Brother laser printer and never think about it. Two, because I'm the best person to write about printers in world history. No one else has written a better printer post than me. I'm sorry, that's just the truth. - Certainly- - These two can try and I don't mean that because there's not better writers than me. I mean, those writers are not wasting their time. - They have better things do. You're the perfect middle of good at your job and also interested in printer posts that has ever existed. - I mean, like the whole staff is better at this than me. I just, they won't do it. - Just the Venn diagram, yeah. - That's fine. And then everyone tweets it and shares it and people write about it. 'Cause it's a joke and it's funny and it's at the top of the list. And then the SEO community says things like, \"The Verge is just taking advantage of their domain authority.\" Which, yeah, that's true. That's fully what we're doing. And then Google's like, \"We don't have domain authority. That's not a thing we keep track of.\" And then you look at the thing and they track something called site authority and it's that dynamic. - Which is domain authority. - Yeah, right, it's just that dynamic which is like, \"Okay, like we understand that you don't want people to game search.\" We have been very critical of SEO forms at game search. Again, Decoder this week is just about people gaming the search and putting small businesses outta business. But if you're not honest, right, and if you deny the things are happening, then the backlash is really strong. The example I keep thinking about is what if every Instagram influencer woke up today and was like, \"Instagram has been lying to us for a decade.\" Like, how'd that go for that platform? - Adam Mosseri just like immediately like, \"Hey guys.\" - He's not making it better. - I'm here with a video on why the lies were worth it. - Yeah, exactly. - Now I gotta go to the Met Gala. - Yeah, I mean kind of. - Yeah. - He is like, \"My glasses are getting more expensive every day.\" - And they look fabulous. - They're very good. What would happen if every YouTuber, I always joke that every YouTuber gets their wings and they make the video about how they're mad at YouTube. What would happen if every YouTuber was like, \"They've been lying to us for a decade.\" That's where Google is landing with the web with these links. We're gonna have a lot more coverage of them now that we know they're real. We're gonna pull them apart. We're gonna talk to some experts. I have people from other companies in my inbox saying things like, \"If some of this is real, then Chrome is essentially spyware.\" - Yeah, I mean, it sounds like last week we were having this whole conversation about Copilot and how everybody was very upset because they felt like Copilot Plus, PCs, all this stuff that's happened, Microsoft is doing is horrible. And it was essentially keyloggers. And it's like, \"Okay, well now we basically have confirmation that Chrome is a keylogger.\" - Well, we- - Almost, right? - Right, there's like a field. - Yeah. - It's like if you were to make a spreadsheet and one of the things in spreadsheet would be like my friend's bank account numbers, and you're like, \"But I never filled it in.\" - Yeah. - I just kind of wanted, in case someone told me their bank account number. - Sure, I do that all the time. - Yeah, people my friends have gone out with on dates. Like, I just keep maybe, maybe that's a page I wanna have in my notebook, right? - But again, I would encourage anyone who is alarmed by this to go to your Chrome history, think about all the cookies that you have. I mean, like, of course it's a key, like what the hell is a browser if not a keylogger? - Yeah. - That's literally its job is to know all the links that you've been to and all the things that you've typed inside of them. And I think to some extent, again, I just keep coming back to this idea that like Google is going to say, \"Okay, we run a search engine. Wouldn't it be cool if we knew all the links people would go to when they weren't on Google?\" And then somebody on Chrome is like, what if we just built an awesome browser and they just, it would be the most, like, have you met Google, thing in history? And to be fair, if any company could accidentally keep those two things apart, it is Google. But like, just strategically, it would be absurd for Google to do this and not actually connect those dots together. - Right. - Again, and I think from some of the antitrust trials, David, you covered some of them. Google has been pretty open. Like our engineers wanted a bunch of click data to make the search engine better and that's why the search engine is good. - So we gave $20 billion. - Right. Okay, well a bunch of people run Windows. We don't have to pay Microsoft, we just have to make a browser and put it on there. And now we run the biggest browser in the world and we get all the clicks. Like that is exactly what you would do. - Yeah, I think the thing is that what's different here is that everybody should understand this, right? Like, I understand that Google is reading my emails because I signed up for Gmail in like 2004, 2005. That was part of the deal. You know, it reads my emails to deliver me ads. So I understand that most people don't, and a lot of times they have these moments when stuff like this happens where it's like, \"Oh shit, they have so much more information about me than I ever thought they did.\" And it's just this moment for a lot of people where it's just like, \"Oh, I didn't, I never intellectualize this. I never like fully comprehended how much these companies have about me.\" - Yeah, and then on the flip side, you have people who are trying to build businesses saying, \"Hey, it looks like you are doing this.\" And Google's saying no. - Yeah, and just flat out lying to them in a way that's like, you know, I don't think Google has any interest in rebuilding trust with the SEO people. - Right, actually one of the funniest things about this is that it's such an antagonistic relationship. I often make the comparison to platforms. Like I think the web is essentially Google's platform and certainly a lot of these businesses are building their businesses on the platform known as Google Search, not the web. - Right? - Right, they're search dependent businesses. And Google does not have like warm and fuzzy platform creator relationships with these folks. - No. - Like Adam Mosseri is like, \"I'm gonna sit down with creators, like, look at all these great creators.\" - He's got a great sweater on. - Right, Neal Mohan, who runs YouTube loves a creator breakfast. - Yeah. - Right, like every platform that depends on creators has that relationship that extracts more value than it pays them. That's life in platform world. They try to mollify the creators all the time. Google does not try to mollify website owners. - No, because I mean, at this point, the internet is reliant on Google. And what Google says is, \"Hey, run our ads on your site and you can have some money. Does that seem good?\" But what I think is so interesting about this is like the YouTube, the sort of social platform example is really interesting because what those companies by and large have done is be inscrutable on purpose, right? Like you look at Adam Mosseri responding to people who are like, \"Why didn't my post do numbers? Why is this one working and this one not working?\" And they never really answer the question except to say, you know, \"Do good work and keep posting and whatever.\" And so what you see is like the people who are successful on these platforms are the ones who are constantly running experiments in public. Like, do you remember MrBeast's whole thing where he was like, \"If I have my mouth open in the thumbnail, it gets more clicks.\" Like YouTube didn't tell him that these are the experiments he's running in public. What Google has done that is so wild is it's as if Neal Mohan called MrBeast and said, \"Shut your mouth, it doesn't help.\" And said, so it's like, okay, it's one thing to not be told the rules of the game and figure them out for yourself. I actually think that relationship is like odd but fine, right? And it's like, here is a black box, it's your job to figure it out. That is sort of the internet we live on. But for Google to have spent this long denying the existence of what people are finding on their own and sort of making people question what they're finding with their own two hands in front of their own two eyes is just wild. - Yeah. - And again, we should say there is a lot about how all of this works that we still don't know. I think a lot of it is going to start to come out very fast because there are a lot of people who do these experiments who are now armed with a tremendous amount of new data. And so I think we're gonna learn a lot about how Google works really, really quickly now. But it just feels so weird to hear the people who do this for a living be like, \"Yeah, I've been asking these questions and being publicly lied to about how my job works for a decade.\" - Yeah. - That just feels crazy. - Also, we should note there are pending antitrust lawsuits against Google and lots and lots of regulators around the world who have been asking the same questions and getting the same kind of answers. - Well, which is another place a lot of this information is coming from, by the way. Like there was this thing called Navboost that came up a bunch in the API, which talks a lot about how click-through rate and the stuff you're talking about, like the long and short clicks, whether you come back very quickly from a search result or stay on the page a while, all of that is part of a system Google has called Navboost that came up in the antitrust trial and made some noise. Where it's like, \"Okay, this is actually overriding a lot of our other rankings is what you do once you interact with a search result.\" And that is very different from what Google has told people. - Yeah, actually my favorite part of all this, my favorite thing because it's such a good name, let's be honest. How do you get me, you give something an adorable name. Google has spent years positioning search as a utility, right? Not as a business that they run, but as the water or electricity of the internet. It's just a neutral utility, you just use it. And we don't have any ideas about it. It's just we set the robots to crawl the internet and they. - They're just a baby. - Yeah, they just find the stuff and they show it to you. And when you try to cover search as anything other than a utility, the attitude from Google is like, \"Why would you do that?\" - Right. - We wanna teach people how search works and we're like, \"No, there's like a culture of search. Like the same way that there's a culture of TikTok, right.\" And that's been a disconnect. But they have done that on purpose, right? 'Cause if you treat something like a utility or a neutral algorithm or just the right answer that the Google brilliance of page rank has discovered across the web, then maybe you don't poke at it too much. And inside these documents we find things like Navboost as part of a system that is called Twiddlers. - Yeah. - Twiddlers. - And the way. - So good. - To think about it is like the big Google algorithm is like the backend and right before it displays your result, the Twiddlers show up and they twiddle the result. - We just twiddle a little. - And so Navboost is a twiddler, it's like categorized as a twiddler. It's like we went and found some other stuff and we're just, we're gonna shuffle that around a little bit. And there's a bunch of those. And like lots of Google systems are built as Twiddler, so they have plausible deniability that the core search ranking algorithm doesn't take these factors in. - Right. - But right before they show them to you. - Just a little twiddle. - Twiddlers baby. And it's like, I'm not that stupid. You know, it's like, it's one system that displays a search result at the end where it happens. Like I don't think they can run around and be like, \"We were always telling the truth.\" - Yeah. - It's just these Twiddlers are outta control. - Right. - They have no control over it. They're just a baby. It's my favorite thing that everybody does now when they screw up, they just go, \"I'm just a baby.\" No, no, no. - It's my first day running search. - Who can say, get over yourselves. - Anyhow, we are gonna learn a lot more about this. We often try not to oversell things. I'm just telling you the web, the people who make the web are aflame because of these documents. Because they do make Google seem, if not outright a liar, as though they have been socially engineering a community of people who make things into not believing what they see, as David is saying. And I think the backlash there is going to be ferocious. - Yeah. - Especially as search traffic declines, especially as user behavior changes around AI. Especially as the AI results continue to tell people to eat glue. Like it's not, there's not a lot of trust left in this ecosystem. And to me, it's weird that there's not more coverage of it. It's not as sexy as a Facebook algorithm or Elon saying is an open source, the Twitter algorithm. But like David said, this is the architecture of the internet. - Yeah, I think it is because, that's why it's so hard for people. It is so ingrained in how most people function that it's shocking to them to a point where it's like, \"I can't even process this, I have to go.\" - Yeah. - Like most people, I don't think fully grasp how much the Google. And most people don't fully grasp how much Google affects their online experience. They just don't. They know it, they see it and everything, but it's just like, just gloss over it. And now it's like, \"Oh, you're having to actually reckon with this and think about this.\" - Yeah, it's why I always like to talk about cooking websites because if you want the single cleanest example of how Google changes the way a webpage works, go read a recipe site. You will see everything you need to see, you'll see the H2s, which Google wants because they're gonna be questions that people might be Googling. You're gonna see the jump to recipe thing. But then you're also gonna see 2000 words of nonsense about their lives because you have to actually stay on the page a long time in order for Google to believe that that's a successful search. They want images that's very important to Google. Like every single pixel of that page right down to how the recipe is structured is made for Google. And anyone who runs a food blog will tell you that the fundamental tension is like, I did this because I like food and I actually work for Google. And that feels crappy to a lot of people. - And now Google's gonna take that stuff and show the recipes to people in AI. - Right, but I do think, one more thought on this that I've been seeing a lot of increasingly in the SEO world and I think is a really interesting, like internet question is one way to read a lot of what we've seen in these leaks is that SEO is dead and no longer will work. Like let me, I copied this one paragraph out from the thing that Rand wrote. He said, \"Google no longer rewards scrappy, clever SEO savvy operators who know all the right tricks. They reward established brands, search measurable forms of popularity, and established domains that searchers already know and click. From 1998 to 2018 or so, one could reasonably start a powerful marketing flywheel with SEO for Google. In 2024, I don't think that's realistic, at least not on the English language web in competitive sectors.\" Like there is a real defeatism to the idea that Google cares a lot about the sites that already exist, the places people already go, what has been going on for a long time. And the idea that you can come and be new and good and smart and people will find you because that's how Google works is a dying theory. - Yeah, I asked this question to a lot of just media people, website CEOs on Decoder. I asked this question at Sundar, \"why would anyone make a website?\" You're a new creator, we're all gonna quit our jobs at AOL, which you should do. Can't recommend it enough. Best decision I've ever made. - I don't plan on doing it. - You should go get a job at AOL just to quit. - Just to quit. - But that's, you know, that's how we find out it works. We all worked at Engadget 2010, 2011. We had this idea for The Verge. We all quit and we're gonna start a new thing. We started a website, like a big desktop website. We didn't even have a mobile site. We started a big hairy desktop website with like forums, and features, and all this stuff. And then the mobile web came and we shrunk down the thing and whatever. But it was never a question that we would start anything but a website. There were 12 of us, we had a big idea. We wanted to do a thing. What we were gonna do was start a website. I think if you get to that place in 2024, maybe some people are gonna start a Substack. I don't think they think of those things as websites. Those are newsletters or independent newsletter on Ghost or whatever. Mostly what they're gonna do is start YouTube channels and TikTok channels. - Yeah, the only people I see who are kind of doing that sort of thing, like right, leaving their jobs, whatever and being like, \"I'm gonna start a website,\" are already established brands, right? - Yep. - Like the folks who are over at Kotaku. - 404. - 404, who are from Vice, these folks just said, \"I'm gonna go and I'm gonna start a new thing.\" They all take that model from Deadspin that became Defector. - Yeah. - And that works. But that is. - You have to have an audience already. - Yeah, that worked because they have that audience, right? Like most people don't have that audience and don't have that scale. And I think Casey's written about that a lot of like, he has to work to get Platformer out. He has to like really put in the effort because scale is hard and it's much, much harder now because of Google. - Yeah. And those sites are all great. I don't think they, like 404 is on Ghost. - Yeah. - Right? So they're taking advantage of some infrastructure for newsletter that exists that lets them be a different kind of thing. But the idea that like we coded our website from scratch, - You wouldn't do that. - We're like, build a product that is a website. I didn't do it. - Yeah. But you know, you wouldn't do that in 2024. - It was just not a good investment in 2024 for the reason David is saying. - Yeah. - And there's, you know, many things have changed in the past 13 years, but the idea that the new creators on the internet will not go to the open web but instead will go to a closed video platform, I think is very dangerous. And I don't know the right answer to get people back to making open searchable web properties. If the biggest search engine is like, \"Screw it.\" Like Hearst, everyone can go read Dotdash Meredith. Like whatever. You know, like maybe that's the right outcome. And maybe that's just the closing of the web. But again, the reason we started covering it last year is 'cause I was like, Oh, the comet's coming.\" And the more we covered it we're like, \"Oh, the comet's coming. Like we should capture this moment.\" And it feels like, again, I thought the comet would be, I thought, I did not expect it to be like everyone is this mad and it just feels like, ugh. We'll we'll see how it goes. We're gonna cover a lot more of it. I think the other browser makers, regulators, there's just a flood of negative emotion about how Google has behaved that it might, it feels like it's coming to a head. - I do have one question for you guys. Especially you David 'cause you use a lot of different search engines. Are any of them good? Like do any of them, when you go and you search something, actually give you those unique results that used to be like, \"Ooh, yeah, now I know what I'm doing on this search engine.\" - Yes and no. Kagi, which is the one you mentioned, which is also what I use. It's 10 bucks a month, it's excellent. I cannot recommend it enough. Paying for a search engine feels ridiculous, but it's worth it, has a thing that it calls small web where it actually deliberately built a like crowdsource database of sites that aren't The Verge and aren't like big mainstream news sites, the kind that dominate search results but are like people's blogs, and little alternative news sites, and local newspapers, and all the kinds of cool stuff. And you can toggle the search just to that. And I think the sort of big omnibus search is never coming back from what it is now. It's just interface changes really. Like I think Kagi stuff is better than Google, but mostly just because it's a nicer thing to use than Google is at this moment. - Especially in Arc. - Yeah, but where we are now is like the only solution is going to be to artificially decide which part of the web you wanna look at. Because all of the signals for the rest of the web are starting to break away from that like find and explore new things vibe. Because that's harder to do and harder to measure than, \"Oh, people generally believe that Nilay is right about which printer to buy.\" And that's actually like a pretty easy thing for a search engine to believe and send you to over and over again. - Yeah. - And we will continue ruthlessly using our domain authority. - We will, I love it. - To break big printer. David, I can't remember if it was you who said this, or Casey might have said it to me in passing. We used to think of surfing the web as a fun thing to do and all of Google's messaging at IO was, \"Let Google do the Googling for you.\" - Yeah. - Which makes it seem like work, and it's like, \"No, this is how I wasted time.\" Do you know how much I didn't pay attention in law school because I was just browsing the web in class. Like that's a, it's weird that we've made the web this unpleasant and the platforms figured it out. And hopefully we can get some of that back. I dunno if we can, we're gonna keep running a website. We're not. We do have a TikTok for as long as TikTok is good. All right, we're gonna keep using our domain authority to crush big printer. - Hell yes. - Just ruthless, ruthless domain authority abuse. But that's our mission here at The Verge. We gotta take a break. We'll, right back. (lively music) All right, we're back. The post credited scene on this episode The Verge has on YouTube is gonna be great. - It is. - That's all I can say. That's all I'm allowed to say about that. It's lightning round one. According to our rundown. The AI lightning round. So there's a bunch of WWC rumors about what's gonna happen with OpenAI. They've apparently inked their deal. Google had a bad week last week. We should talk about that, more Google. GPTs are open now with OpenAI Store. There's a lot. But I know people want us to talk about our press release, Fox Media's press release, which is that like many media companies, Vox Media signed a content and technology deal with OpenAI. The Atlantic had one on the same day. It was like Fox Media, Atlantic. We're in the headlines together. I don't know David, you run, you interview me. - Yeah so, okay. I think the big question to me is both how do we feel as people who work at a company with a deal like this? And what is this, what does all this mean about the media in general? So I think like we just had a conversation earlier with a bunch of the folks in our newsroom talking about this stuff. And I think I wanna know for you, as somebody who runs a newsroom, you didn't make this deal. You, I assume will at some point see the contract because you're like yelling about contracts. - I don't think that. - It's thing you do from time to time. - I sincerely doubt that is true, I'll do my best. It is more likely that I will see someone else's contract before I see our own company's. - Oh, that's interesting. That's a fun reporting tactic. Can I bully my boss before I can bully somebody else? - Like our company's very good at being like, \"No, you can't just report on our own company.\" Other companies like, \"Here's the stuff, like.\" - Yeah. - That's just the way of being a reporter. - Yeah, that's fair. But so I am curious for you as like a newsroom leader, how you even think through what a deal like this means. - Sure. We do a lot of disclosures on this show. Famously, I think. I've had journalism professors talk to me about the fact that our disclosures are a running joke with the audience. Like we wanna be really transparent about where information comes from. Reasons to not trust us if you don't wanna trust us. Like my goal is always to just empower the audience with information. So that's the top level. So like if you're listening to this and you've listened to the show, that's why we do disclosures. That's why they're a joke. Like I want, the only currency we have as a news organization is trust. So we're trying to, that's why we have the background policy, right? All the spokespeople have to use their names when they talk to us because we don't wanna pretend we know something that they just told us. - Right. - If Google, or Apple, or Microsoft, or whoever wants to talk to us and get some information on our pages, they need to be accountable for it, not us. And that's just trust. That's just, who are you gonna trust? Where does the trust go? Who do you have to trust to believe the story? So that's the top level. Right next to that, which I think the audience doesn't see as much because why would you? Is our newsroom has to not think about it. Like that's actually what independence is, right? Is not, I know that our company has a deal or an investor and I'm just going to like, I'm gonna think about it as I write the story. The goal is they don't think about it at all. - Right? - And we just go do the reporting and we publish what is true, or what we believe, or what we think people should know, right? And in any traditional newsroom, that's the what is called the firewall, right? So we do stuff, our sales team, there's advertising over, we just came back from an ad break, right? Like and that team. - But we don't know what the ads are, I don't know what ads just played. - I get so many emails with the crypto ads. I don't know man. - Yeah. - Like I think crypto's stupid as shit. Like what do you want me to do? Like that's that team. And if we open the door and start telling that team what to do, the danger, and this is a danger that is proven out over and over again in newsrooms around the world, if we open the door and start telling them what to do, they're like, \"Hey, that door's open.\" - Right. - We're gonna start telling you what to do. So we just keep the door closed. This is why you have the firewall. It works in both directions. So for me, and I understand OpenAI, in particular is a pretty shady company. I feel like our entire episode last week was like, \"This company is pretty shady.\" We're gonna talk about- - I was like, I just waiting. - Whatever. Fine, but like that's the commercial side of our company. And I understand, like I've talked to a lot of media executives, like I'm running around and covering Google Zero. I've been talking to a lot of media people lately and I can talk about that bigger question David, of like, are these good deals? Are these like a good idea broadly? 'Cause I think I've done some reporting, I have some thoughts about that. But the thing that like when our press release went out, like, \"No, we're not gonna change or cover OpenAI.\" Yes, I think when it's appropriate we'll disclose it. It's not like a. Like Comcast is an investor in our company. - Right. - Like we disclose that every time we whisper about Comcast 'cause they're an investor, this is a licensing deal. Like we have a lot of those across our company. And I don't wanna just get into a situation where I'm like, \"Disclosure, Yahoo licenses and RSS feed of the Dodo.\" Like what do you want? Like I think that door can get too open, we can overread it. - Broadcast would go a little long. - It would go a little long. And I want to preserve our independence. And what independence really means to me is, \"Yes, we'll disclose it. Yes, we'll earn everyone's trust.\" But I would prefer it if we were just covering OpenAI without thinking about it. And so that's the balance I'm trying to strike. I'm open to people's thoughts about how much you need from us to continue having that trust. But it is in many ways, like more of a normal deal than people are expecting. Right, like when we did a Netflix show, I think there was less outcry, but like I was the producer, disclosure, I made a Netflix show. - Every time. - You should watch, you should watch a Netflix show. - David and I are gonna make one just so that we can make that disclosure. - That was like way messier. Right, like I'm going to meetings at Netflix about our show that I was not allowed to talk about until our show was made. So I wanna make sure we like find the right balance. And I understand there's just a lot of feelings about AI and OpenAI in particular, but like at the end of the day, the goal for all of these media companies is to just get some control back out of a situation that felt out of control. - And what situation is that? - Well, they took everything anyway. - Right. - Right, that's the situation. And we can talk about that broadly. I just want to separate the two things. Like our newsroom is independent. OpenAI did not buy any control of our newsroom. We will be very honest with everybody when we think the disclosure would affect how you perceive one of our stories. And I think that, you know, around copyright law, like that makes sense to me. We're gonna write a story about the New York Times lawsuit against OpenAI. That is a great place for disclosure. OpenAI launches a new GPT feature. Like, I dunno, you tell me. Maybe we need to do that every time. But like I don't wanna overread it as though to make it seem like we're doing something we're not. So that's it, that's like my top line. Like we will have a disclosure. I love a disclosure. Disclosure, Comcast is an investor in Vox Media. I made a Netflix show. - Disclosure. Alex Cranz is the last remaining Paramount plus subscriber. - It's true, hi. - Look, this is our brand and we're gonna do them. I just, the thing that I am trying to be careful about is separating how people feel about these deals broadly and what it means for our newsroom. - Right, well, let's talk- - And what it it means for our newsroom is the status quo. Like it is not changing. We are gonna operate without fear or favor. And again, my goal is to earn everyone's trust by being as transparent as we can be. And I just wanna make sure that we're not so transparent that we actually go in a full circle and no one believes us. So like, you tell me where you think the line is. I'm open to the feedback. I asked for it from our staff today. I'm asking for it from the audience today. But the main thing is not changing, which is I want, I would prefer it if our reporters were not worried about an OpenAI deal or thinking about it and we just covered the company like we have been for a long time. - Yeah. - Yeah. - And this is the thing we should say, like a thing I've learned about the media business over the years is that it's very unusual in the sense that like, that tension you're describing between the work that we do and where the money comes from is like good and healthy and should always exist. And our editorial and sales team should always like hate each other a little bit. It's like a useful thing. But also like we have tech company ads all over our website. - Yeah. - Like that is, it's a not dissimilar thing. And it is just something you have to navigate and get comfortable with. And like people always like sending us the stuff where I will, we will make a Vergecast about how terrible Facebook is right before a Facebook ad. Like it's my favorite thing. It's so funny. But I do wanna talk about the broader piece of this. Because I think the, I think you're right that the reaction I saw out there was less like, you know? - Can I say one more thing? - Sure. - We're not gonna start publishing a bunch of AI content. Who, hello? - [Alex] I think people see partnership and they're like AI content. - Except for the printer post. - Yeah, I'm the only person who's put AI content on the website. Both posts were about printers. - You disclose. - I wish you people would get mad at me about it and make that post go even more viral. - Yeah. - No one will do it. - We will only use AI to ruin our domain authority in Google Search, that's what we're for. - I'm sure we're gonna end up building some AI, like there's one thing that all of us want, which is we would like better alt text on our images to make them more accessible, to make the site more accessible. We would like our site to be better for screen readers. Right now it's a lot of very manual work. If we can use some of these tools to make that better or make our site more accessible, that's a great outcome, right? I dunno if that's gonna work. Right now our creative team tells me like, this alt text is not good enough. And AI, everybody, it's just not good enough yet. But if we can start to build that stuff, that's great. So there's that part of it, which I think is interesting. I don't know what that looks like. I haven't talked to our product team about any of that stuff yet. But the other part where The Verge is just The Verge, that's gonna remain exactly the same today as it was yesterday. - Yeah. Okay, let's talk about the broader side of this because I think there are two pieces of the should media companies be making deals like this with OpenAI question that I find very interesting. We should talk about both of them. The first is, \"Haven't you idiots learned your lesson from making these deals with companies like Facebook and Google, and everybody else who promised you money to save journalism and in fact forced you to do a bunch of stuff, pulled out the rug and kind of screwed up the industry?\" The second is, \"Aren't you guys, don't you realize that AI is out to put all of you out of jobs and just take your information, use it in training data, and then get rid of you? Why are you ushering in the journalism apocalypse?\" And I think to some extent those are like two versions of the same question, but I think are like the big picture things going on here. Like, are we contributing to our own downfall or are we chasing money at the expense of doing anything that is smart or long-term thinking? - I mean, the media industry never does anything. - Yeah, the media industry's not known for really good business. - This is mostly a vanity project. - The thing we have talked a lot about on this show is that we, the media industry as a whole probably should have spent more time over the last decade building Facebook competitors than making Facebook videos. And I think, like my hope is we have learned that lesson and that the next minute of the journalism industry will be learning that lesson and executing on it. Which is, I think part of why we're so excited about the Fediverse 'cause it's a thing that opens up possibilities for new kinds of media products. Is there a fear that OpenAI and the like AI search engine stuff that is inevitably coming is just the next pivot to video and everybody falls for it and gives up on building new things for five more years? - Yes. Okay, so here's, I just, I'm gonna bracket our company because they did not talk to me about this. Which is like, that's the firewall. - Yeah. - But Nick Thompson, who is the CEO of The Atlantic, has published a bunch about why The Atlantic did the deal. He made a video about it. You can watch it on LinkedIn. Nick used to be the editor-in-chief of WIRED. David used to work for Nick. - I did, I love Nick. Nick knows, he knows. - Yeah, he gets it. - Nick and I are friends. He knows, he understands what he is doing. Axel Springer has signed one of these deals. The Financial Times has signed one of these deals. A lot of these companies are signing these deals. My understanding of the deals from the reporting, not from the digging around our company, but from the reporting is twofold. One, we just spent a whole bunch of time talking about Google. Google is a fair use argument, right? We're gonna come and index all of your information. We're gonna show it to people. In return, you'll get traffic. And everyone said, \"It's a little squeaky, but okay.\" And then Google won a bunch of cases against different media organizations that did not like this idea. - Yeah. - \"We're gonna index every book in the world and show it to people.\" And the book publishers are like, \"No, you're stealing our stuff.\" And Google won that case. Google, \"We're gonna index all the images on the internet.\" A bunch of porn publishers said, \"No, we don't want you to do that.\" And they were not the most sympathetic defendants in the world. Google won that case. Google said, \"We're gonna put every episode of South Park on YouTube.\" And Viacom said, \"No.\" And then they started posting episodes of South Park to YouTube on their own, and they lost their case. There was not a great legal strategy, but that's what they did. But that all of Google, that whole platform dynamic was, \"We're gonna take your stuff and we're not gonna pay you. And we'll, you'll get something, we'll pay you in exposure. - Yeah. - And that, look around. So I think a lot of the reaction right now is, \"Well, we cannot let that happen again. We need some rules.\" I think a problem for all these companies is that OpenAI and Google and whoever else, Anthropic, Perplexity, well you name it, they've all taken it anyway. - Yeah. - Yeah. - They have it, Llama scraped on the internet. Every Facebook video we've ever made, - OpenAI. - Is in Llama. - Built a tool to scrape YouTube for more data. - Yeah. - Like that's just how it's done, yeah. I think, you know, Abenson, our own company, I know nothing about the deal beyond we have one. - We have to keep saying it, right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - We have one. There it is, here's your disclosure. There it is. - Vox Media has a content and technology deal with OpenAI. - Yeah, I think you're right. Where it's like, it is a thing of, everybody, it's already been taken. It's already gone. Everybody, the cat is outta the bag, right? Genie's outta the bottle. Whatever euphemism you wanna use there, it's happened. And now it's, \"Okay, what do we put a price on that?\" And a lot of these companies we're starting to hear more about the price there. We're starting to hear what it is. And that might not end up being the right price, right? Like these deals might not be the right deals, but they are deals, they are money where there wasn't money. - I think a really interesting thing is how do you set the right price? What is the value? They've already trained on it. - Yep. - What is the deal for now? One of the things that has come out about these deals, which are all, from what I understand, they're all basically the same structure. I think the News Corp deal is like $250 million over five or 10 years, right? Most of the other deals are $10 million over five to 10 years, something like that. I think it's five. The main thing that has come out about them is that they govern how much can be displayed, how the information is displayed, how it's attributed, what links are in it. And you look at that and what I see is a honestly a reaction to Google, which has gone from, \"We're linking to your stuff,\" to, \"We're gonna cut out your stuff and put it in featured snippets,\" to, \"We're gonna have our AI rewrite, whatever, and just show you the answer and never send you a click.\" - And then you'll eat glue. - And there's nothing you can do about it because we're indexing your website every single day, all day. - Right. And there's nothing you can do about it 'cause there's no contract, right? So what I have heard and what I see is like that control, and I think Nick, again, Nick Thompson, that former editor of WIRED who knows, has been public about this and his announcement in The Atlantic, that control is the thing. Because if you go beyond that, you don't have to go invent some copyright. - Yeah. - Argument. You have a breach of contract claim. And that's much easier to litigate. The other thing that I see happening all over the industry, and we made an entire Decoder episode with Sarah Jeong and I about how all of AI rests on a totally shaky copyright fair use argument that could blow up at any moment. - Yeah. - Like OpenAI, your business could blow up at any moment because you have weird ideas about copyright law. No one can afford to litigate these ideas. So the New York Times sued OpenAI, somewhat famously, they've spent a million dollars in that lawsuit so far. Public company, we just know the answer to get nothing. Like they haven't achieved an outcome yet. They're just done. - And they could lose. - And they could lose. So that's a coin flip. The New York Times big public company, they run a very successful video game service. Maybe the most successful online game service of all is the New York Times. Wordle just paying the bills for this lawsuit. Most media companies do not have just some cash cow cooking website or gaming service to fund a lawsuit about their journalism. And so I think they're all looking at the Times lawsuit. They're saying, \"Well, this is gonna take five years. This is gonna take 10 years. It might go to Supreme Court, they might lose.\" Hopefully the Times wins. If they win, our contracts will expire right around then and we'll renegotiate with the strength of this copyright precedent. And if they lose, we'll just re-up our deal. - Yeah. - And I see that playing out as most media companies cannot afford to go litigate these deals. And importantly, no one can afford to sue Google. - Yeah, like Google's got infinite money. - And I know everyone's talking about OpenAi and you know, whatever. Disclosure, OpenAi has a content technology of Vox Media. I would just, we just spent that whole first segment about Google, which is the thing, it's the 800 pound grill. Everyone on the web operates in the universe of Google, including OpenAI, right? OpenAI has made Google dance to borrow a Dallas quote, but they're still it. Like Google's the big profitable, ultra high margin company and OpenAI doesn't make a dollar as far as I understand, right? They're still losing money. So you just, there's a difference there in how these companies are perceiving their antagonists. And I think they can get OpenAI to come to the table and eventually what they're gonna do is they're gonna go to Google and they're gonna say, \"Pay us.\" Your competitor is paying us. Our traffic is dropping, and if it continues to drop, we're gonna let, we're gonna pull the plug on you indexing our website. And I dunno how long that's gonna take. Maybe it'll never happen because the threats are effective. But you just see that's where the trend line is headed. - And then you'll see, you'll only get the URL for buy this one printer Nilay Patel recommends. - I'll sell you one link, Google. But that's like broadly how I see the dynamic of this playing out is the copyright. I care a lot about copyright law. The copyright argument is so uncertain on both sides of the coin that people are trying to buy some certainty so that they have leverage to go negotiate against the real power in the ecosystem. - That makes logical sense to me. I also think it might be wildly optimistic about who is actually going to extract anything from Google. - I like our media executives. I think they're brilliant. It should be clear, I think Nick is very smart. Most media executives are not. - No, I mean. - Like A Players. - Even the thesis is good, right? Like I buy the thesis as far as it goes. I just think there is not a lot of evidence that says anyone can pick a fight with Google and win because we are in this moment. I mean, like you, you keep harping about Google Zero. Like when that happens and people have nothing to lose by picking that fight with Google, they might start to pick that fight with Google. Right now, if I just say you can't crawl my website anymore, overwhelmingly I go straight outta business. - Yep. - Yep. - That's what I mean, this is what I'm saying. Like the trend lines. - Right, but trend is so slow. It's so, so slow. - It's slow and it isn't slow. I think for some publishers it's super slow. For others it's not, right? - Yeah. - If you're seeing shakiness in your Google results and you're seeing AI overviews and you're like, \"Maybe Google Zero is real.\" Or you're a mid-size publisher, right? Which are not getting these deals right now, it's all the big publishers are getting this deal. But somewhere down the road, the mid-size publishers, I assume will get the deal, or be offered a deal, or go ask for a deal, who knows? At some point, right, the trend line of our Google traffic is going down, our investment in caring about you is no longer worth it. And they're paying us money. Like I just, that is, it's a destabilizing factor in all these conversations where there have never been destabilizing factors for about a decade. - Yeah. - And so we'll just see like the last time this happens, this is the negative argument. I'll give everyone the negative argument. David wrote about this, he wrote about Google AMP at the beginning of last year because I was like, \"We gotta start with what Google has done to the web.\" Google did AMP because Facebook showed up and said do instant articles and put all of your articles directly into our platform and they'll load really fast, something native on the web, and we'll send a shitload of audience to them. And Google freaked out and did AMP and then all the publishers had to do AMP. And this was a disaster, just broadly all the way around a disaster. And then Facebook was like, \"We hate news.\" And they're like, \"Actually what we hate is text.\" All of you make videos and everyone pivot to video. This equal growing disaster, AMP turned out to be a huge mess and you couldn't do anything good. It actually spread misinformation 'cause all the websites look the same. I could go on about this for days and days and days. Google is there again. - Yep. - They're afraid of something. And so like the ripple effect of that I think is interesting. And I think what most of the publishers that I've talked to, what they're interested in is can we make them, not copy and send articles AMP, but copy payments for search? Because that's what they all want. One thing that we haven't talked a lot about on the show is a bill in the United States called the JCPA, the Journalism Competition Preservation Act. It's funny, you would think that the publishers could all get together and say, \"We're gonna pull our content from Google Search.\" They have a lot of leverage. If they do it all together, you got a lot of leverage. What's left? They can't because that would be collusion under the antitrust laws. - Yep. - Which is incredible. So the JCPA is, I think it's a Klobuchar bill that would create an exemption for publishers to bargain with large platforms like over a billion in revenue. One of those numbers that like makes it Google and Facebook. - Yeah. - Like it's one of those ways of saying Google and Facebook without saying Google and Facebook, it would create an exception to antitrust law. So they could bargain as a unit against large platforms. - Or they could just like rule that Google has built a monopoly. - Yeah, there's a lot of that. There's just a lot of these ideas floating around about how you equalize the bargaining power. - Yeah, yeah. - Anyway, I just see the bigger picture, which is the raw deal is real. Like people got burned super hard by the raw deal of the platforms. Most of which were, \"We'll give you some money with no contract that says where the money will come from the Facebook news partnerships or the Google news initiatives.\" Or it was, \"Make a thing for us that we want,\" Facebook video. Or it was, \"We're gonna take your stuff for free and pay you in exposure,\" which is Google Search. And what I see now is we have a contract. - Yeah. - Right? We're just not doing this again. You're gonna pay us money. We're gonna tell you what you can take. And if you don't pay us enough money, we'll sue you. And if you take too much, we'll sue you. And that has a little bit of teeth. I dunno if it'll work, again, I know a lot of media executives. Alex used to work for some of the worst media executives in the game. - I sure did. - It's not like they're not all, this is not an industry that can see the long game. And it's an industry that's under pressure. So it might be making mistakes, but I see the difference here. I dunno if these are good ideas. I dunno if they feel great, right? Like there's a lot of the response yesterday and to all these other deals is do these feel great? No, but I think I can identify the differences and I think at least what I see is, well, they took the shit anyway. - Yeah. - Like some money is better than no money. - Yeah, I mean. - And a lot of the deal for a long time was no money. - That's definitely where I'm sitting. It's like some money is better than no money. But also one, I wanna just point out, this is a lightning round and we've been on Nilay's lightning round. - Sorry, sorry, sorry. - For a while. And so I wanna take over for my lightning round. - Oh yeah okay, you got one. - Which is also about OpenAI. - Of course it is. - Because I called it. I just, back when OpenAI, there was the coup and a bunch of the board members were like, \"We don't like Sam, we're firing him.\" Everybody gathered around. Sam was like, \"No, you were baby, we love you, come back.\" He's now back in charge. More powerful than ever. Right, like that's the reporting allegedly. Like information just said, \"OpenAI CEO cements control.\" So like that's happening. - They started, they fired all the safety people or pushed him out and then they started. - Yeah, they fired all the safety people. - He's the head of the safety committee. - Yeah, that's a choice, Sam. But Helen Toner, who was one of those board members who voted to have him kicked off, kicked out, and then left because he won, was on a podcast this week and was like, \"Yeah, we just didn't trust him.\" - Yeah. - Like he just was so consistently not telling us the truth. We just lost all trust in him. And that is really, really interesting to think about as he does cement more power, as he does get more powerful, as he does put himself in charge of safety at the company. And all of those people who were in charge of safety have left. And as that company is still technically run by a nonprofit, that's whole job is to protect us all from AI. Like, oh buddy. - Yeah. - That's not working for you. - I'm actually, I'm curious. It's been, like this Scarlett Johansson situation has not, there's been no new pieces of information. It's been pretty quiet on that front. - Yeah. - That's not gonna just end. - No. - Right, it ends with a settlement or a statement or an apology. - Well, she's gonna do a partnership with OpenAI as well. Like, no. - Yeah She has some great ideas for alt text. - Yeah. - But like the backlash to AI in general, but I'll give you this little data point. I think there's a real gap in how people feel about the thing and then what people are doing. We've never gotten so many sort of like unhappy notes about a Decoder episode, is when we had the CEO of Adobe on. We had some happy ones too. People wanna hear from that guy. He doesn't give a lot of interviews. I asked him what he thought a photo was. He doesn't know. But then we got a lot of people who are like, \"Screw this guy.\" - Yeah. - We just don't like Adobe, we don't like AI. Like they're ruining everything. His comments about AI are offensive. Weird, right? - There's real backlash to AI right now. - There's some negativity. One thing he told me in that episode was generative fill is used as much as layers. They launched this tool and it is used on the order of layers in photo, which is basically people open the app. - Yeah, that's how you get layers. You open the app. - Like you open the app and then like people use it. And so there's a real gap. And I think Sam kind of embodies the gap. - Yeah. - Right? Which is he's just the face of, \"Boy, we're not being very careful with this.\" He's the face of, \"I can do whatever I want 'cause I'm a Silicon Valley.\" - Someone's gonna call him the bad boy of AI soon. I'm sorry, I just said- - No there's nothing about his demeanor that supports bad boy. - Yeah. - I'm sorry, it's just not. - It's coming, don't worry. - You can't, it's not gonna happen, I'm sorry. - Brace yourself. - There's much better contenders for bad boy than Sam Altman. But like he's the face of that gap. - Yeah. - Which is actually the revealed behavior of many people is that the tools are useful, they can be helpful people like them. Like I'm the nation's foremost humdinger of what is a photo. And I definitely use generative eraser in Lightroom yesterday. For a family photo that I shared with no one. - I would use it all the time. - AI Denoise in Lightroom I think is magic. I've talked about it. It has re-contextualize how I think about some of my old cameras. - Yeah, we talked about this earlier today where I think a lot of people don't realize how many of the tools we actually use are already AI, right? Like Grammarly is using some sort of AI. Photoshop is all AI and if you've been using Photoshop for the last 10 years, you've been using AI. - Yeah, it's in there somewhere. - But I think you're right where it's Sam Altman has become kind of this, the center point and everybody's talking about him, and they're talking about specifically. - Because they don't trust him. - They don't trust him and they don't trust the kind of AI he's doing. Which is a very specific kind, right? It's taking over your search. It's providing just easy generative content in a way that most AI tools that people use have a very specific purpose and are used for very specific things. And he's built the Liebot. - And, you know, OpenAI, this incredibly byzantine corporate structure was all meant to box in the bad things. - You box in the Liebot and keep the Liebot. - And like keep it safe. And he's torn all that down. - Yeah. - And now OpenAI, instead of being this weird nonprofit with a profit center that supports the nonprofit feels like just Sam Altman's company. - Yeah. - I mean, it's called OpenAI. Like I would just point out like their whole thing was being the good guys for so, so, so long and they made it so far on big promises of being the good guys and then just like on a dime turned and went the other way. It's really wild how fast this has happened. - Right, GPT-3.5 hit, they're like, \"Oh, people like this, we're evil now.\" - Just, it's like they just put on their little evil helmets. - But so the interesting thing is they don't, again, they don't have any revenue, right? Like, this company is not wildly profitable. They might be on a path to it. - You don't even, - They make all this noise. - Revenue is not important. You've been covering tech too long to know that, to not realize that revenue is not important as long as people will keep giving you money, you don't need revenue. - Which is why I think they make all this noise about AI all the time, right? They're like, \"We built the future.\" - Yeah. - People will keep giving you money. - The number one, the funniest like a GPT apps are out now. - Yeah. - To everybody. And I was just looking at the top one in lifestyle is an astrology app and I was like, \"Oh, this is actually a perfect use case for AI.\" - Yeah. - Like you'd be like, \"I'll just make some shit up about your future.\" Yeah, we should talk about that, so WWDC is coming up, there was some reporting this week that Apple has made the deal to sign with OpenAI that OpenAI will power the stuff. Interestingly, there's some back and forth about whether it will run locally on the phone, which would match Apple's privacy promises or go up to the cloud. Which is fascinating because- - More powerful. - More powerful. But where will it run? There's some reporting, I think Mark Gurman and Bloomberg reported that they're gonna put M2 Ultras or M3 Ultras in a data center and have a virtual black box. - Oh boy. - For privacy. - That works out every time. - Who knows? - It gives real like Beeper running Mac Minis on your behalf. - Exactly. - Vibes. - Yeah, and then you've got OpenAI in the mix, which is like, where's this model gonna run? Can it run on the M2 Ultra or M3 Ultra or whatever? - I mean no, you can't fit the thing on your phone. I'm very confident that you cannot run GPT-4o on your phone locally. - Right, but can you port it to arm? Like this thing right now runs on Nvidia H100s. - A lot of them. - Yeah. - Like a lot of them. - And you know, what two companies hate each other with the fury of a thousand burning suns? - It's so good. - Is Nvidia and Apple. - Yep. - But they're also two of the best people at making processors that can handle AI stuff, right? - Except for GPUs. One of them is really good. - One of them is really good the other one- - The other one just took the training wheels off. - I can play Crusader Kings on my laptop. - So I'm just very curious about how all this will play out because if you're gonna run GPT-4, there's a chance you're running it on a bunch of H100s in a Microsoft data center, which is a real weird place for Apple to be. - Well what about Gurman's piece this week about the deal was also kind of interesting 'cause it seemed to be like they're not gonna go full out with all the AI tools. It, what we're gonna see from them at WWDC as far as AI goes is gonna be a lot more Adobe like than - Yeah. - Scarlett Johansson voice like - I don't think they're gonna Chatbot and I think that is the right move. - Yes. - Oh that's so fun. I totally disagree. - Yeah. - Really? - I think they're going to go full hard with Siri and I think that's the OpenAI play, is just take the Siri you can talk to and plug it into GPT-4o and instantly it's the best Siri has ever been. Then how you scale that down to like turning off Bluetooth, which is a thing that I can do on my phone that does not require the internet, is becomes a really interesting AI challenge - You just described like the promise of Bixby. - I mean what do you, what I use Siri for almost exclusively is playing music, adding reminders to the reminders app and setting timers. And none of those things require pinging GPT-4o. They just don't. But I think Apple, like everyone else is going to have to convince investors that it has a chatbot play in order to survive. Not survive, but you know what I mean? It's Wall Street wants to see that you have some big newfangled idea and so they're gonna do it because they feel like they have to, all the interesting AI stuff is going to be the like, on device stuff. And that's the thing that we're already seeing Apple do well just by putting AI features into apps, you're gonna see a lot of it with photos. There's a lot of noise around AI generated emoji. That's the kind of thing you don't really need OpenAI for that actually Apple has been working on for a long time. The only reason I can see that you would strike a deal like this with OpenAI is if you wanna blow out the like conversational aspect of things. - Just lies so much in the face of Apple's security stuff. Like. - Yeah, but so does the Google deal, like. - So that's true. That's true, but the Google deal, like we didn't know the terms of the Google deal for years, right? And whereas this was a fairly public deal with OpenAI really close. - I mean it's just been better reported on because OpenAI is the leakiest company in the history of the world. - Just like, just holes everywhere. - Yeah. - By the way, it's only the M2 Ultra. - Only. - This was driving me crazy that I kept saying M3 Ultra. 'Cause they're on the M4 now, so I just assumed. - They just got a lot of M2 Ultras. - M2 Ultras where they stopped with the- - They're like, is this as good as an H100? OpenAI, tell us. - I think Apple knows that the idea of the behind is an external perception of the company and they're watching companies kinda light their brands on fire and not, they're just never gonna do that. I think. - They're cautious to the extreme in that way. - Maybe. - And I think this crush ad disaster for them, which was not even about AI, it was an iPad ad. - Yeah. - That everyone decided was about AI. I think they saw that and they were like, no, like we're gonna do some stuff in photos and some stuff in emojis. - [Alex] Well, there's gonna be stuff in search, so. - I'm sure, yeah there's gonna be some like light dusting. Remember last year where they were like, \"The keyboard has AI in it now.\" And it's like, \"This keyboard is dumb.\" - Yeah, it is real bad. - It's like still pretty bad. They're gonna do that kind of thing. - Yeah. - And I think it might be everywhere they might announce more features, but that last turn where it's like, \"Do you want to bang an iPad?\" Like I don't know if we're gonna get there this time. I think they're very comfortable with the perception that they're quote behind because they're, I think they're watching Google. I think they're watching the reaction to their own advertising and saying this stuff is not ready and the culture around it is too negative. That is just my sense from, you know, just talking to folks. But I don't know if, I don't know what they're actually gonna announce. - I look forward to, we're gonna be there live. And we're doing a podcast in Cupertino and I am going to spend a lot of time gloating on that show about how right I was. And I'm really looking forward to it. - [Alex] I really hope David's wrong, just so I can gloat. I just, that's it. But I hope you're right for you spiritually, David. - I just, I think if you're worried about the stock price of your company and I know that they are, you look at what is happening at Microsoft and you say, \"Oh, we need something like that.\" And what they'll say is, they'll make a lot of noise about like all the stuff you can do inside of apps and then it will come around to, \"And also it wants to be your best friend, let's hang out.\" - Yeah, also Siri is horny now. Tim Cook will be like, \"Woo.\" - Can you imagine? Just imagine Tim Cook being like, \"And Siri's horny now.\" - Yeah, just flirty with Siri. I love it. - Looks Kevin Roose dead in the eyes. All right, we gotta, this lightning round has ended up in strange places, but it's been a good one. We'll be right back. We have yet another unsponsored lightning round. (lively music) How long is this episode now, four hours. We're gonna talk about ourselves more for another hour. - It's three hours. - [David] We are currently at 81 minutes. - All right, we gotta wrap. We gotta bring this to a close, lightning round style. I'm gonna bring out the ULT Power 7 or whatever it's called. - Is that your lightning round? - This is my lightning round. It's been more like a lot of lightning, this. - God, the Sony logo is slightly holographic. - It looks kinda like, \"Oh,\" you're like, \"Oh, does it lit up?\" No, holograms. - Sometimes I remind people that The Verge's entire competitive differentiation is that we love gadgets and I'm telling you, this is our entire competitive differentiation. - Yeah, we both, we freaked out over it for a minute. - Nilay nobody's gonna sponsor the lightning round if you just pick up a speaker and talk about how terrific it is every week. Like, get that money from Sony before you do that, man. Come on. - I don't know how there's a firewall between edit and sales. They keep telling me that there's incoming lightning round. - I think all of our sponsors are gonna be like a month late being like, \"Remember that time Nilay got really weird with our speaker on air, Sony.\" - I wish I knew how. - I think Sony will love your lightning round. - Look, if you're a Phil Sony or whoever runs Sony, give us a call. Someone is here to take your call. Mega bass, ultimate sound or whatever power vibes. Whatever it is, power vibes. - ULT. - All right, Cranz, I ran you over in the last one. You got the first one. - Yeah. So it's gonna be a gadget, in that Fitbit has a new watch for kids. - The Ace. - The Ace, the Ace LTE. And is it a way for you to track your children with GPS? - Yes. - Yes. Do you feel uncomfortable about that? I don't know, I'm not you. If you do, this probably is not an exciting gadget for you. But it seems really cool because it, like gamifies fitness and what appears to be a really nice way, Victoria song went and got to check it out. I've heard from some other people who have gotten to check it out and everybody's just like, \"No, this thing rules and I kind of want one for myself.\" - Yes. - And like, that's the hallmark of a good ass gadget for kids. - Yeah. - Like you can take the band and replace the band and there's like a little Tamagotchi kind of thing in the watch. And so when you replace the band, it'll like change. - It's awesome. - It's sick. - All adult fitness trackers are like, let's talk about your VO2 max. And this one's just like, \"Make the cool little guy go.\" And like, that's how you get me to do stuff, come on. - Exactly. Like this thing just kind of rules except for- - It's too expensive though. - It is way too expensive. It is $229.95. And- - It's also called the Ace LTE which is like the least cool kid name I've ever heard. - It's real bad. And also you need a data plan to get the full richness of it, called the Ace Pass. - Oh boy. - And it is not cheap. It is like $10 a month. - Ooh, that's tough. I'm gonna stick with just putting an AirTag. - Yeah, just. - Somewhere on my phone. - You can alternatively stick an AirTag in your child and give them a 20-year-old Tamagotchi. - There you go. - And done. - Yeah, we are not yet, we have not yet hit the, \"Let's put an AirTag on her.\" - What if you glue the AirTag to the Tamagotchi? - See that's the- - Or 3D print some sort of case, I bet Sean could do that for you. - Yeah, no, there's infinite. This is the entire Etsy economy is weird, AI generated crap, and then 3D printed stuff. - It's beautiful. - That's real. And please you can put your AirTag on anything. There is a case for it. If you wanna attach your AirTag to a thing, you can find a case for it on Etsy. - Yeah. - Yeah. All right David, what's yours? - I just wanna talk about this like slightly weird Discord blog post this week. The company basically announced its pivoting back to video games. - I didn't know it left. - So this is the thing. So in 2020 when Discord was like really feeling itself and there was noise that Discord was gonna be acquired for I think like $10 billion. It was the work from home moment. The world was weird. We try not to talk about that period of 2020 very often. Discord like announced that it was going to be more than just a gaming thing, right? It wanted to be a community app for the future of the world. And Discord actually has like gotten a lot of things about building a community app, really right. There are a lot of things about it that are very clever. I don't think that worked except that people started planning like crypto and crimes in Discord more. - Yeah, it turns out there's a lot of like shitty communities out there. - Yeah. And not a lot of like Fortune 500 companies running on Discord. So anyway, so the company pivoted back and is now about gaming again, but then made a bunch of small changes that don't really change anything. And then said they want to be easier for connecting either before, during, or after playing a game. And I would just point out that's all the time. That's still just everything. So I think I'm just in a strange place where it was like, I forget who it was, but somebody in our Slack was saying like, this is not a message to users. This is a message to investors of like, \"We get it, it's fine. We're we're running away from crypto. Please stop doing crimes in Discord.\" And, but I just thought it was very funny. It's like Discord is like, \"We will remain Discord. Just like, please only only do games here, please.\" - Yeah. - I did learn new things from that blog post, I didn't know you could have Discord on like the PS5. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Clearly I don't use that feature. - It's a web app. Like ultimately you can deploy web app anywhere. - Yeah, but like. - Sometimes you're like, \"What if I deployed this in the PS5?\" And you're like, \"Why?\" - It 'cause it's got a sick process. Looks cool. - I mean, Discord's a really good chat app. Part of me wishes they had gone more mainstream and instead of like the 50 WhatsApp group chats I'm in, I was in a bunch of Discords. Like, I feel like I'd feel cooler, but alas. - No, I'm in a couple of, a bunch of Discords. You're fine. You're fine. - I don't do enough crimes, you're right. - No crimes that I know of. - I don't do enough NFTs or crimes. - Oh no. - Alex, I'm guessing you're in at least one Plex related Discord. - I'm not. But I did think of the- - Just putting that out there. - Some crimes have definitely happened in some Discords I've seen. - By the way, Jason was on Decoder a while ago, basically previewing all of this, if you wanna listen to him talk about it. I had spent a lot of time being like, \"Crimes happen here.\" And he is like, \"I need it to stop.\" Like more or less. And he said to me a really interesting stat. He is like, \"Most Discords are like three people.\" It's just like three or four friends hanging out in a Discord. And that's like the vast majority of Discord activity. And then the big ones are like for other stuff. - Right. - But we talked about why they make games and their app platform and all this stuff, and he is like, \"We just do that to dog food, like features for the big games.\" All right, I'm gonna pick one. I wanted to pick iFixit and Samsung breaking up and other repair companies are starting to say they can't fix Samsung stuff either, that's boring. What I want to pick is X the platform formerly known as Twitter now hiding likes. - Wait, what? I missed this. - It's very good. So they're not hiding likes. They're hiding who likes something? So, you know, people used to go on Twitter and like likes something you can see all their public likes. They're hiding that, they're hiding replies. They're doing this because bros keep liking porn. - Yeah, that's not, that's all the funniest stuff on Twitter. - That was the best like when Tim, Tim Cruz, Ted Cruz. - Yeah. - Like was like, \"I love this.\" - It's very good. - Yeah, you do. - It is the funniest sign of a platform in decline that its user base is now so stupid they don't even have fake accounts to like porn. - Yeah, I was hearing about, there's apparently some male reporters who love to like models on the Instagram and they don't know that they get the little, the emoji also is shared on threads. - That's pretty good. - Be be thoughtful. If you're gonna be horny, don't be horny on main. - Look, how do you increase Android phone sales by a burner phone to do horny stuff? All right, are you listening to me Google? That's what the Pixel is for, horny stuff. - It's pretty good, actually. - Buy a burner Pixel. - Just for the horny stuff. - A refurb Pixel 5 with that beautiful red case. It's available to you. It's just an idea how to increase your sales, save your company. Twitter, X is saying soon you'll be able to like, without worrying who might see it. We want to encourage people to like more edgy content. They use the word edgy. - Wow. - [Alex] We want you to like your porn more often. - I'm if you are the sort of person who describes your own work as edgy, not edgy, like, I don't know, it's like Sam Altman is the bad boy of AI, it's like he can't be, but he would love it. He would like it so much that he'll never get it. - Yeah. - Elon wants Twitter to be edgy so much he'll never have it. I just think this is truly one of the funniest changes any social platform has ever made. There's like other reasons, right? Like I'm confident Elon wants the weird racist who now populate Twitter to be able to like weird racist posts without seeing it like. - Yep. - Yeah, there's a deep dark weirdness there. - Go into the likes and look at the likes still? - No other people can't see them. - At all. - Right. Like you yourself will be able to see who liked your posts. - Okay. - You can see the like counts for posts like public like counts. - Man. - But you'll not see who likes someone else's posts and you will not see others. You'll not see what other people like. - I cannot wait for one of those creators of edgy content to get fed up with their edgy followers and just put them all on blast. - The saddest little black book in the world. - Yeah, the saddest little black book. It'll be so good. - I mean it's truly, deeply, wonderfully hilarious. - I love it. - A platform and decline just doing the weirdest stuff you can have. - I just really like the idea of ultimately doing good healthy things by removing engagement metrics in the service of making your platform easier to be sketchy on. Like I think that's great. - Yeah. - Twitter is gonna end up, X is gonna end up, I think as a porn platform. Like I think they will find a way to subsume OnlyFans because it's the last thing left for them to do. - It's video first now, supposedly. - Oh yeah, Linda Yaccarino, she appeared. She had not appeared anywhere since the Code Conference from what I understand, which went great for her. - Can you repeat the question? - And she appeared and said X is now a video first platform for creators and everyone went, \"What? You don't make any videos.\" Elon Musk never makes a video on his video first platform. - But if you wanna make corny videos, you can. - And secretly like them. - Yep, Ted Cruz is just gonna be ecstatic. - All right, I'm just saying. And we are in a new era of the internet, right? I dunno what's gonna happen to the web, but I know this is the ULT Power Sound era, and I'm convinced this is the horny burner Android phone era. - For when you're urged to like something is irresistible, but you don't want anyone to know this. The Pixel 6A. - Be like, I just gotta hit that heart. - Yeah, you want them to know, but you don't want anyone else to know. - But that's actually a great, like opposite of what happens on iPhone stays on iPhone messaging for Google. When you want them to know. But no one else to know that Google picks Android. - You're just doing Google's job today. - It's pretty good. - I'm trying, man. I'm trying to help everybody, all right? Someone give us some money somehow. Lightning round's available for a horny Pixel sponsorship. All right, that's it. We're way over time. I appreciate you all. We do want your feedback. I'm very sincere about this. I know people have a lot of feelings. We are here to earn your trust in whatever way that this previous segment earned your trust. Send us a note, you can reach out to us. You can call David at some phone number. - 866-VERGE11, call the hotline. - See it, call us, we'll answer your questions. We're again, we are not trying to hide the ball here at all, but we are trying to go home to our families. So that's it, that's Vergecast. Rock and roll. (lively music) - [David] And that's it for the Verge Cast this week. Hey, we'd love to hear from you. Give us a call at 866-VERGE11. The Vergecast is a production of The Verge and Vox Media Podcast Network. Our show is produced by Andrew Marino and Liam James. That's it, we'll see you next week. - All right, Alex just made a huge discovery on the ULT 7, or whatever this is called. Tell us what the ports are. - Okay, we got a light button. We got a battery button with a minus sign for battery care. - Okay. - Key control. I don't know music. - That's for karaoke. - Okay. Echo, guitar. We got a guitar input, right? - This thing rules, I don't know what- - There's a lot going on down there. - These are all fully karaoke controls and then you can play a guitar through it. - Sure. - I dunno what battery minus care does. - I really wanna know, but probably not today on the Vergecast. - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Boy, can I, there we go. - There we go. It's got some Numa Numa energy, right? - Yeah, it always starts in the middle, which I really like. - I love you. This thing fills me with pure joy. - You're so happy. - Like every other tech company is like, we gotta do some AI stuff that the robots are gonna bang you. Like let's just threaten everyone. And Sony's like, here's what's gonna happen. - The bass speakers on the side really. - Yeah, Sony's like we're put RGBs and the bass speakers also, it's called ULT Power Sound now. And that's our business. - It's good shit.",

    "transcript": "every once in a while a new company decides to enter the lucrative space of selling piles of manufactured garbage to people with no impulse control and the New Rising Star in this depressing cycle is temu and the person with no impulse control is me so let's all gawk in Collective Terror at the pile of random gaming crap I bought from [Music] TAMU [Music] let's dig into this bag that looks like it was fished out of the local rubbish dump and maybe there are some real gems in here oh yeah oh yeah that's a a nice birthing of temu [Music] stuff um I I don't know what this is oh their little shoulder triggers for phone gaming so you attach it to your phone like that and then you have like shoulder triggers while gaming on your phone yeah it it presses the button on your screen so this could potentially be a useful way to make your phone a little bit more gamery and double is a chastity device neat this thing is called a magnetic semiconductor mobile phone radiator the box looks like it's been returned several times so I I don't think I'm the first person that's interacted with this [Music] one this little mobile phone radiator's got a tiny fan with what looks like fake copper heat sink and then you attach it to your phone like this and then it supposedly cools it little problem that I foree with this to power it they give you this USBC to a cable and usba is like the least mobile phony USB now according to this manual this thing is so powerful that when the phone isn't in use it's normal to have condensation appear on it and even freezing so according to the manual this thing is a complete Beast I mean it's got reasonable weight to it I am very very excited to see how this turns out next I think we need to check out this unmarked box there is a picture of a dpin on the side I think that means I should just throw it straight in the bin oh it's like an outer protective box this gaming mouse really stood out to me cuz of its weird do Bill shape and gratuitous buttons relatively high quality foam starts off promising we've got a nice braided cable it's got buttons up the butt it kind of looks like if one of those MMO mice had sex with an irradiated platypus this would be their baby that is the lamest click I think I've ever felt on a mouse before uh and then we have slightly better clicks we've got another two buttons behind the main buttons I don't know if that is an ergonomic way to use these clicks I feel like they're just going to get in the way and you're accidentally going to press them the whole time not entirely sure what hand shape this mouse is designed for oh we're actually going to get some venial disease with it as well that's a good touch I couldn't not buy this because it just seems like the dumbest idea ever to me it's like half a keyboard because gaming besides how could I not buy something called the MC Axe 2 it's kind of just thrown in here oh we've we've kind of lost a whole bunch of of key caps already hopefully they're quite easy to replace it's not a great sign that you immediately have to reassemble the device I think they're like fake Cherry MX Blues this is the Revolutionary new quirt keyboard layout why even waste time with using just half a keyboard layout on it like one of the beauties of a normal keyboard is that you can game with it yes but then you can use it for everything else you use a keyboard for whereas this is just not a usable keyboard it doesn't feel terrible your hand does really sit on it in a way that makes sense but I'm missing half a keyboard but we are going to have a huge amount of macro buttons when we combine this half keyboard with the mouse the final piece of our peripheral puzzle which is this headset by Hunter spider again lovely packaging oh we've got the second gamious shape a biohazard sign right on the inline volume wheels something I despise on headphones by the way these volume Wheels immediately introduce Channel balance issues and break if you as much as sneeze at them ooh a nice Touch of Class with the Chrome plastic surrounding what I assume is an RGB biohazard symbol I don't even know what I'd call that material why does it feel like it's designed the wrong way around I mean it it it fits yeah they're almost more comfortable the wrong way around but then you don't have your you know of your microphone H oh that was a stupid way to take it off this thing I'm not sure whether it's very smart or really stupid but it is a mouse Jiggler undetectable and it's got a mute switch on it I feel like this is designed for nefarious purposes so this moves your mouse cursor so you can pretend to be working oh well it does have a USB hub on it which may be its most useful feature now I think this may easily be the thing I'm the most excited for it's an augmented reality game console that cost like a handful of pennies and some shame I'm assuming it's like a Wii ripoff first off we get the little controllers ooh that is that is really sickly feeling plastic they did learn from the initial wi launch to have a little lanard on the end of the controller so that you don't destroy your TV with it but you actually get two controllers so you can play with another person insert the product USB hole play music Follow The Rhythm to transform a variety of colors do you plug it into the console I think this is the console oh no okay before we get to it uh we have the cables that we need to connect it oh that's not for the controller cuz the controller uses AAA batteries which of course didn't come included with it because why would it and this is the console a word that I didn't know I'd ever used to describe whatever this is I genuinely have no words for what this thing what and with that worldclass Insight it was finally time to try all of the crap [Music] now straight off the bat the miles of mouse space this keyboard gives you is pretty nice but I have developed a sudden onset phobia of having to log into accounts now I think theoretically a game like DOTA makes quite a lot of sense for this setup because you've got a bunch of macro Keys you can use for spells you can even use a bunch of buttons on the mouse although I still think these are really dumb the ones on the top the main problem is that how am I going going to be able to Flame my teammates in all chat because I don't have a full keyboard and that's like 90% of the reason for playing this game and it didn't take me too long after loading into a game to start running into problems oh that's not F3 oh these are the F buttons wao that's so disorienting now I may have just won that game but it was very much despite of the little keyboard which was the main handicap now I can't type any GG there's no enter I kept finding key bindings I had to change mid game cuz I didn't realize when I started that they wouldn't fall into the scope of capability of this keyboard and you really have to get used to the weird button layout which isn't worth getting used to cuz the keyboard is just conceptually a bad idea now the headphones are also surprise surprise a complete Abomination not only are they very uncomfortable but the moment that there was a bunch of stuff going on even at low volumes it was like the driver was bottoming out it was just a whole bunch of distortion and when it comes to list listening to music they're not even funny bad with like a really exaggerated sound signature you often get with budget headphones like this they're just kind of sad bad the best way I can describe their sound signature with music is like those in years that you used to get with iPods if those somehow managed to have even less detail which means by technicality alone the winner of the prestigious least terrible peripheral in this lineup award goes to the mouse which was is a functional Mouse it's perfectly serviceable reasonably comfortable despite having gimmicky buttons which may take a while to get used to um so how does this work do you just look at it go there it is I mean it works it it follows a very predictable patn [Laughter] but why yeah it's like your boss team views into your PC and it EES your mouse cursor do that across the screen every now and then and they're like oh yeah no Steve's clearly working no you can also change the speed at which it diagonally Scrolls across hey this zoom in now and now that we've witnessed this Marvel of engineering let's move on to the next thing so this you stick on your phone okay so that's the magnetic bit cool a couple of problems I think the so lives up here so I'm not sure how much this is going to cool that and it's quite bulbous just like that we have the gamest iPhone ever now we do still have the problem of having to plug this in luckily I have a very handy USB hub [Music] available hopefully hopefully our Mouse Jiggler can power this Beast of a cooler oh wow that has ruined the ergonomics of the phone that cooler is remarkably in the way although it's getting cold can I skip the ad with this I can no oh that was a mistake oh that just made me see more of the ad oh no I'm trapped in ad hell but once I finally managed to escape the pit of game ads I immediately ran into a problem um this game doesn't have any inputs at the top of the screen so the shoulder triggers are kind of useless it took me longer than I'm willing to admit to find a game that lets you adjust the UI and put useful buttons at the top of the screen but once I did the results were glorious oh finally mobile pubg actually lets you set your UI so that you can use the shoulder triggers that's exciting so I've set R2 as aim and and I can shoot using L1 oh there's someone behind me well he didn't have shoulder triggers so how is he going to win that fight oh there's another person two kills I do feel like the trigger only register some of the clicks though I think that's because the buttons are real small and finicky but once you find a game that supports them they kind of work next to test the effectiveness of the cooler I used geekbench first with no cooler now as you can tell by the cabl sticking out and the shocking fact that the phone is cold to the touch we have our cooler attached oh the GPU score is actually a little bit lower with the cooler on but what about the CPU no way the cooler made a measurable performance Improvement to the CPU Benchmark which is pretty cool look at that we've destroyed the average uncooled loser iPhone 13 performance it is still wildly impractical [Music] though hey ah waa that was so loud a few moments later so now that I've taken a moment for my shattered eardrums to recover not only is this a functional device which I thought was about not as likely as pigs learning suduku but we also get to Basque in the Majestic light show that it does for some reason aside from the spectacular light show we also get multiple categories of games to choose from I see okay so you do have to use it kind of in landscape mode well obviously I have to start with augmented reality games happy rope skipping happy trampoline and happy writing I don't know I feel like somebody needs to get the creator of this console a thesaurus uh let's start with happy rope skipping aimed at identifying box oh I think I need to change I need to move the camera successful oh yeah look at them Graphics I mean it's it's responding to what I'm doing or was it only one way to find out does it go faster okay I'm done that's as much of that as I'm willing to do let's try another game let's try happy trampoline that sounds like it's going to be exactly the same thing who that's stupid okay so it just makes you jump a little bit what what I need to use my face why yes exactly why I don't know I feel like this is how you throw your back at oo the console clearly had me impressed so it's basically like playing this game with a controller except significantly worse oh it's really struggling to track my movement but then I found a game that really spoke to [Music] me oh [Music] yeah oh yeah I mean realistically this is the kind of thing that a kid would play with twice and then never interact with it again but this console like an onion had many more layers to explore next I feel like we need to try some motion sport games oh yes the age-old sport of throwing gobling oh this is just wanker cramp the activity isn't it well I guess I don't have to do it like that and the combination of no instructions with terrible motion capture meant figuring out what the games want from you is a real struggle is this the movement it what does it want for me but no matter how how many games I tried I kept coming back to good old throwing gobling what you got Goblin weak so at the end of the day the combination of barely functional motion capture and a games Library that's half stolen NES games and what I can only describe as lobotomized Wii games I'd say the 95 Canadian dollar asking price is way too much for this thing which brings me to the end of the video thank you for watching subscribe or I'll mail some of this teu crap to you and till the next video [Music] bye-bye",

While it focuses on water cooling enthusiasts, its modular interior and exterior should appeal to anyone.  They were also showing the Lancool 2 which is looking like one of the best affordable cases around.    A special thanks to Phanteks and Steelseries for making Computex 2019 possible.

    "transcript": "what's up guys I'm Dimitri Lian Li has plenty of awesome things the Odyssey X the new land cool 2 some prototype fans that are all attached together let's go check it out by huge thanks to Phanteks and SteelSeries for sponsoring our complex visit alright good people so this is the odyssey x this is Lina Li's answer towards the whole movement forward with the open frame concept and I really appreciate what they're trying to do here it is expensive the price point is between 300 to 400 dollars but that is only because so much engineering goes into something like this because this case are all the same parts as this and you can turn this into the vertical orientation or take this vertical orientation and put it into something a bit more traditional the price point also reflects the construction elements so everything is aluminum here we have tempered glass we have anodized little accents for the i/o and they are thinking about expanding that color horizon beyond the black and red into titanium silver bronze and I mean look at this I oh it's so tiny but so pretty the the feet as well and we have a Type C at the front I also it is future-proof and I really appreciate this whole direction of customizing certain elements in the case that has character and yet has a little pop of color too so the concept of modularity it will come disassembled which is actually the whole fun part of assembling something like it so you can get you can basically immediately start building something like that or go into the original orientation they wanted something user-friendly for modders to removing certain panels there on all on clips easy to loose installation you can paint them you can mod them you can cut them and that's the that's the whole idea they're really trying to optimize the user friendliness in terms of converting the vertical orientation into something more traditional so for example the top plates and the vertical orientation are actually front panels when it's in in this orientation front panel in here is going to be the cable cover in the vertical orientation none of the parts are wasted so you're using all the same parts and just converting something that would fit into a different space and everything is currently done on screws and they want to really streamline that procedure by using a little clips so the Pano's with clip-in and you use only a few screws so the entire assembly will not take you hours but maybe 30 minutes or so the only four parts that are not shared between the two frames are is actually this little mount for the tempered glass side panel that you can see is bent and that is so cool so a little bit of airflow options in there and gives the case so much extra character and that is because you need this angular piece into which you attach the tempered glass panel versus the original orientation as you can see it is all flat so those are the only pieces that are not used and not shared between the two frames and so the whole idea behind this case is water cooling why would you spend $400 on the case that supports air cooling they told us course that is possible but right now in this traditional orientation you have a bit more space in front of motherboard tray so you can mount a radiator on the side and the front and at the top as well and you have a bit more space in front of the power supply verses in the vertical orientation you have a bit of that height advantage so what they they did here is this massive reservoir on the top plus a really nice thick radiator up there as well in terms of the advantages it's would be based on your preference and the physical characteristics of something that is angular and taller versus something a bit more traditional I really admire Leonie for going out of the way to design something like this because if you guys recall the rio toro enclosure that comes disassembled and you can actually expand the height of the enclosure that was the initial stages of what i would love to see more of in the case industry explaining the case options either size orientation and format and I feel like The Odyssey X encompasses all those elements well and then we have the land cool 2 if you guys recall the land cool one that was an interesting approach towards the front panel and that whole open options but the Lancool 2 is taking it's taking a different approach in terms of adding more features for a really affordable price point this thing is supposed to cost $89 and under 100 bucks I feel like it it's got a lot of competitive options so first of all this dual plate option to open up the sides so this way you open up the the power supply shroud you can access your hard drives this way you can actually access the power supply as well in case like need to unplug something that you accidentally plugged in too much and this also has multiple functionality because we have this indentation and ventilation so they have fans mounted on top of the power supply shroud and it actually helps to draw in some air I really like this dual panel approach it cuts down on the cost and they figured out a way to add functionality for that bottom plate which is awesome but now let's talk about the front panel so first of all the lighting here is very nice and ambient and that is because the actual LED strip is between the dust filter and this mesh in the front over here so it gives the whatever's underneath there a super beautiful glow and look at what happens because there are pins over there so there it's a completely tool-less panel you can simply remove it you don't have to constantly connecting cables and that's where an $89 case is actually quite a rare to see and I start the show for me would be this fan bracket that supports up to a 360 mm a radiator and the cool thing is that we have these little pins at the bottom and those pins allow you to actually rotate the bracket and because of how the frame is designed you can insert this fan bracket more inwards giving you a little bit more space over here before the front panel and by rotating it it allows you to actually mount the fans further inside I find that a really cool way to give you extra space on the interior or if you want to have everything outside of the frame that is also possible and I really want to see more companies do this because not only does it mean that you can install things outside of the frame but you have this whole modularity approach of having something outside of the frame or like this further in to give you a more more space for course pool or some water just leaked and that's for the hard drive cage this is cool it's on a rail system instead of being set to locked locations with screws or little mounting points which means that you can literally push it in and clear up all this space for push and pull setup and you can pull it out depending on on like how much space you actually don't need and clear up a little bit room and from the power supply love this approach want to see it more often that's what the interior one cool element is this cable cover so right now it's in the standard ATX position but look at this boot you take it out you again rotate it you push it back in the pins and now we've opened up this area for an e ATX motherboard while still giving you that full coverage in terms of where the cables will exit and they will fully be covered I love these little details that make the assembly procedure like they don't interfere if you have a standard ATX motherboard but gives you options if you go beyond and coming to the back they're not done yet with a feature set man how is this an $89 enclosure I don't know but okay look at this cable management two plates one for the CPU backplate one for this whole side section can you see any cables I can't we have dual assist these that they're visible beautifully you know behind the glass they are also including an optional hot-swappable harddrive bracket because they're accessible from the other side which means that you don't necessarily need to come on here federal around with your SATA cables everything is like thought about it is this is optional but I would highly recommend you pick one up if you are actually using hard drive cages and we also have these do SSD caddies on this no floppy cover and finally we have a more finished OLM on dynamic excel rog certified case a few changes here include they've removed a lot of the ROG branding from the front now it's just complete brushed aluminum block and the only ROG branding is a little tiny thing on the temporal gloss panel thank you so much I'm guessing this is gonna be enough feedback from the community they don't want something like you know really branded a few more things include a new SSD bracket that this tool is that you can relocate from the back all the way to the front and it just snaps into position they've also added this whole fan pocket which means that you're installing anything at the bottom you don't have to rotate the case and screw in the fans or radiator now this bracket is two of us again you can remove it and install everything that way we have a new extension for the motherboard which means that if you're using that massive 15 inch motherboard you can install this in there and extend that whole selection they've also expanded the rubber grommets whereas on the original it was just on the corner whereas here it spans beyond little little details that really make a big difference they've also added hot swappable hard drives at the back the UNAM come included this is not unlike an optional thing like we saw with the land cool - that's what the price is going to be $1.99 and I feel like the 11 dynamic XL is going to be that thing that people have really wanted from the O 11 dynamic originally something bigger something that supports really large GPU blocks and you still have the same sort of design of mounting all types of radiators on the sides at the bottom or the top and yeah looks like a really awesome case for water coolers and enthusiasts alright guys so that is it from Lian Li I'm really looking forward to seeing the final Odyssey X and I really love the budget direction the $89 price point tool and cool to the feature set and everything there just feels nice and complete so let me know what you think about these two enclosure you saw thanks much for watching check out this other relevant stuff over here and we'll talk to you in the next video",

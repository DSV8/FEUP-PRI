    "transcript": "- Hi. Where are we going to put all the stuff? We're off on a car adventure. (car engine revs) (upbeat music) We've made it to the Grove. We're checking in. I don't think I told you guys what we're doing today. The F1 race is happening and we are borrowing a McLaren to go watch the race at the Grove in the parking garage, with other people with cool cars. A lot of these people their cool cars are actually their cars. This is not my car. Today, this is my car. Tomorrow I give it back (mumble). Mask on, ready to roll. (pop music) - We are not cut-out for McLaren life. (laughing) - So the race is about to start. We all have to get in the cars because they're going to take some aerial photos. You know, I did bring my drone, but I feel like, probably shouldn't fly it because in case it drops on one of these, you know, million dollar vehicles. There's this really cool Ferrari here. That is not even street legal in the U.S. - How did it get here? Do they do car crime? - They do car crime. - Cool. (soft music) - So Jordan's here and I completely forgot that we were there the day you got this. - I was like, you've seen this before, right? I swear. And then yeah, you brought up, Oh yeah. You were at the, the delivery day on it three years ago. - I know. I wonder if I made a vlog, I'm sure there's a vlog somewhere of us all in it. - I made a vlog. - You made a vlog? - I don't know if you did. I think you probably took some photos or something. - Justin! - What do you think? - I love it! - It's so perfect! - It's crazy it's been that long. My warranty is expired. So now, I did my last service with the warranty. I'm sure it's going to be really fun. Whenever anything else comes up. - Okay. I feel like it's probably kind of expensive to do some maintenance. - It's not cheap. - So the McLaren that we are borrowing First question that Jen asked was are we able to drink or eat in it? Because our friend, Jordan we weren't allowed to eat or drink. - So I was pushing it a little bit. They said, everybody sit in your cars for the start of the race. And there's this coffee that was delivered there. I was like, Oh God, can I pour it outside? I'm like leaning over the sill. And then, I took sips. That's the first non-water beverage I've ever had to drink at that car. So that's a real accomplishment. - Yeah, I mean, I'm impressed. I know that probably honestly like you were dying inside. - It was kind of terrifying, yeah. Everyone watching this is like, bro, you need to loosen up. - But also, wow! Those wheels are nice. They're like a carbon fiber, like, wow. - Yeah, you're right. There are many manufacturers that offer that. It's pretty cool. It's unique. - I don't even have a car right now. - You just keep getting press cars. So you don't really need one. Wherein Mustang Maki, Chevy. What have you? - Well, it's like my car stopped working and now it's fixed, but like I don't have room because I've got all these borrowed cars. So because I went from like no cars to not have too many cars. It's a really, it's a YouTuber problem right now. - How much space is in your driveway without making your neighbors really angry? - It's not a lot. We were in trouble. (laughs) - Oh my god! Is that ijustine from the McLaren GT? - Yes it is I. - Whoa. (race announcer on background) - Sir Lewis Hamilton (people cheering) has crossed the line. (car honks loudly) - He really is. I mean, that's who I was cheering for. - Sir, he was really just dominating. - Is that you're cheering for? - Yeah - Who are you cheering for? - I mean, Lando did well in fourth place. I was flying in Twitch rivals with him. So I feel like I have to give him a chair. - It was a really solid lineup this year. And I just think everyone did great. - And on that note. (uplifting music) - Got up so early today and now we're doing this drive. It's so amazing. I do see why people do this drive early. - Yeah. - Because there's like A lot of cars - Lots of cars - So you need to get up real early. Next time, we've learned. - I saw holes - have never been more terrifying than they are right now. Oh man, we did it, but this is not the end of the adventure. You need to go take a nap, reassess, and then Jenna and I are going to go out for sunset. I'm so glad we have this rollout safety mat - I hit my head so hard. Getting out of the car - You hit your head so hard? - I hit my head three times getting it out of the car. I'm just not used to it. - So that's for round two of the adventure I'm picking Jenna up and we're going to go to dinner and then we're going to catch the sunset. We're going to Manhattan beach which makes me a little nervous. Parking is going to be a struggle. There she is. There's Jenna. I got to go get her. Oh, we need to unlock. Hey - Where's the fridge at? - It's in the front. - It's actually in the front. - In the front. - It fit? - I put the mini X-Box fridge in front. Jen, welcome to the vehicle back again. - Who are you talking? I was like, who are you talking to? - Our friends in the lens. - Hello lens. We're going to dinner. We're going to love and salt. It's going to be so freaking good. I just want to say like, I've driven a lot of cool cars before, but never I've never driven a McLaren. I've never driven like super, super, super, super cool cars. And I just want to say I get it now. - Yeah. - I freaking get it, I didn't get it. - That's why they're super cars. - I get it. - Super cool. - I am so sad that I've made it this long without it. - It's probably a good thing. It is probably a good thing because I would probably have several McLarens at this point And I would flex - Flex. - Well, I might be living in that because I probably would have a house. (upbeat music continues) - The thing about Manhattan beach is There's a lot of like roads with different angles and Hills. And that kind of scares me. We're new to this low car life. We're new to the life that is low to the ground. It's terrifying down here. - I'm so low at like, it's crazy how low. like I could slide into this minivan. Kia Sorento. - Please don't - I'm going to go under - That's how you die. - No, we will go right under, it's so low. - No! - We're inside of a restaurant right now. It feels like we're committing some sort of a crime but we're so far away from everybody. It's crazy. - It's just weird. I coordinated today. - When you're inside a restaurant I don't know how to feel. - I feel hungry. - We're very far away. Like there's no one by you. - There's no way. It's like more than six feet. (upbeat music continues) Hey, can you? I want them to hear the sound of this starting up. - Okay, car's coming. (car engine's start up) - Yeah, you know what else? We pop this into sport. - There's a car coming. - You here that? I'm honestly going to just listen to loops of McLaren car revving engine. - It's nice. I need roller skates. - Should. (laughs) - So the beach did not work out because the parking lots were so crowded because it was finally a nice day in LA. So we settled for, well I was going to say a very abandoned alleyway. Just there's a car coming. There's a car coming. - They can go around. - Okay, They can go around. - Yeah. - You know, it's a Sunday. (upbeat music) - I need to show you guys. What's in the trunk. X-Box fridge. Are you going to get a TikTok shot? So you guys have seen the dude on TikTok where he has people with cool cars what their job is or they work. Pretty cool! - Why do I have such trouble getting in? Maybe you just like have your window off - Okay - And then I'm gonna come up to you And then, - Okay - And I just saw this girl she's in this nice car. Let's find out what she has for a living. (knocks on the window) Excuse me, first, you have a nice car. I just want to know what do you do for a living? - I'm a celebrity hamster trainer. - I like your car. Interesting. - I'm about to give this car back and I'm so sad because I've had the best time with it ever. But there was one feature that I wanted to show you guys that you've never seen this before. You may have actually seen this in one of my CES videos from maybe two, three years ago when McLaren and 1 plus did a collaboration for this prototype phone where it had electro chromic lens cover. So basically hid the camera. So you couldn't see it. And it happened electronically and it was basically inspired by the McLaren. So let's start this up real quick. (car engine rev) It's so beautiful. So you'll see up here on this little dashboard there's a little sun and then a little moon. And this is how you adjust the electro chromic sensitivity I guess you could say, so you either turn it on or off and then you can adjust how much light is going through. And it's really cool because it just automatically happens. It's like magic. So thank you again to McLaren for hooking us up with this car for the weekend. My entire life has completely changed. Like everything after driving. This is, I don't know what I'm going to do now that I know that this is a thing. I don't know. (soft music)",

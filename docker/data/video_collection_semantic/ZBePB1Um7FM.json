    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here And this is the newest Razer Blade Stealth. This is running the 8th generation CPUs from Intel, Kaby Lake-R, so it's a quad-core CPU and I did a review of the previous version of this, the, I guess the 7th generation Fantastic device, I feel like they had updated a lot of stuff that people wanted, and this is just kind of revision that's just a little bit better. Now, I want to clarify one thing before I go too much further into this review A lot of people think that this device is a gaming laptop I know most of you don't, but there's a surprising number of people that are like, \"Hey! Does this thing play games?\" It is not meant to be a gaming laptop It's made by Razer. Razer makes gaming peripherals and gaming stuff, but this is not a dedicated gaming laptop Not to say that it can't play games like, by itself It can't. It's running some like non-gaming internals But you can plug up an external GPU if you do want to play games which I'll explain further down the line But just to clarify, this is not a dedicated gaming laptop. Okay, so let's talk about things that haven't changed. The build quality hasn't changed Nothing actually from the exterior has changed that much The one biggest difference is that this model is the gunmetal grey version So they still make the regular black one with the green Razer logo and RGB lights and stuff, but this one's gunmetal grey, and I like this one more Maybe because I've seen the black one so often But this one's just a cleaner design to me. The logo is more subtle and everything just looks a little more muted The one thing that is a good thing or bad thing is that RGB's on the keyboard that are on the regular Razer Blade Stealth are not present on the gunmetal gray version They only light up in white. The keyboard, the trackpad, basically everything is exactly the same on the exterior It's a good keyboard, good trackpad They updated the trackpad in the previous version to use the Windows Precision drivers which is just way better And the screen options aren't changed This one here is running at 3200 by 1800 screen, IGZO panel It's not the brightest thing ever but it's fairly bright, and it has a pretty good color gamut lt also is a touch screen if that's your thing. If you really like the colored RGB keyboard from the black model But you want to clean finish, like this, you can always get a skin from dbrand, just cover it up and it'll mute the logo and protect your laptop The ports aren't changed. There's got two USB 3.0's and HDMI and then your Thunderbolt 3. Now this Thunderbolt 3 port is for power like you powered up through here and also supports four lanes of PCIe so if you connect an external GPU to this thing, it gets full bandwidth The one thing that's a little bit different between this one and the previous generation of gunmetal grey is that This one's a little bit darker, so this is the other one, the earlier 2017 one It's really hard to tell from this camera, but this new one is slightly darker than this one You know what? There's also another difference On the inside, the little Intel stickers, the 8th generation one is like a quarter of the size of the old version Now, I've seen some other eighth generation laptops that had a regular-sized sticker So I don't know why this little one exists I know this is really important right? You guys should be aware of all the little details about this laptop Okay, the internals have changed a little. The layout is just a little bit different from previous generations. The RAM is still soldered on and the SSD is still removable, but they've actually used a much faster drive this year Which is nice. Now, in terms of coil whine, my unit here does not have coil whine I have seen a lot of reports of people getting Razer Blade Stealth's with coil whine issues. All the review units I've ever had didn't have it so I can't really comment on it But this one yet again does not have it. Performance is excellent This one's running the i7 and 16 gigs of RAM and these new Kaby Lake-R chips are quad-core CPUs that get really fast for short bursts. They benchmarked really well. The built-in GPU is still pretty weak You're still not gonna be able to play some amazing games on or anything You can play some light games But even moderately demanding games are gonna make it choke So if you want to play games, you either get something completely different like a gaming laptop Or you're gonna have to connect an external GPU to this thing Thermals under load are fine and same thing with fan noise It doesn't get super loud or anything and we connected to an external GPU Temperatures are also good. The external GPU handles most of the graphical stuff so the laptop stays cool Now if this is the type of setup you want so it's like a thin and light Ultrabook combined with a external GPU There's a lot of companies that do this kind of thing, but I still think the best company is Razer They were the first people to do it so they probably have a little bit more like experience with it But the connection is rock-solid, and it's just it just works really really well, and I'm running the first generation Core still They have a newer version that has an updated Thunderbolt 3 controller, and you can connect external devices that work on a different pipeline But I mean the performance is going to be identical to the first generation, but yes If this is what you're looking for, I cannot recommend a better setup than these two. Now Now, it's still not a hundred percent efficient. There's some issues with using Thunderbolt 3 GPUs, but for the most part They're pretty good. Now, if you want to learn more about them I've done a video that kind of details this whole process a little bit more I'll link that below. Okay, the performance and video editing is not as good as you might expect This is a quad-core CPU, but it's a 15 watt CPU. There are quad-core CPUs like gaming laptops that are 45 watt CPUs And those are just able to maintain a higher clock speed for just longer periods of time this can hit 4 gigahertz for a little burst and then it'll drop down to its base clock and when you're video editing That's just not ideal. So you can get stuff done if you're working with 1080p footage or just not video editing very frequently Sure, it can kind of work especially with an external GPU, but if you want something that's just more long-term Are you working with higher res footage? Go with something like a quad core gaming laptop Those just do much better for edits. Okay, battery life has not changed. I'm still getting seven hours on this thing I know with the Kaby Lake-R's, it's supposed to be slightly more efficient I'm still getting seven hours, and I think it comes from the screen. The IGZO panel looks nice and the colors pop But it just uses a little more juice It is still like, for the most part, of full day batteries So I'm not too worried about it If I had to nitpick on some things on, if I, I mean I do like this laptop a lot but if it just had to be that guy that just hated on something, it would probably be The speaker's. They're not bad They're like really well positioned, but they don't sound amazing they sound very like you know, run-of-the-mill Ultrabook There are thin and light Ultrabooks like the MacBook's that just sound amazing And it would be really cool if a Razer could stick something like those into here Then this thing would be like really really cool, but yeah, not amazing speakers. The other thing is the backlighting on the function key So like F2, F3. It also controls volume down and volume up, but in complete darkness You can't see the secondary controls because they just don't light up, and it doesn't bother me because I rarely work in complete darkness But for people that require that, yeah, can't control brightness and stuff unless you know exactly which keys do what, but that's basically it. Those are some minor complaints about this really good laptop They did a really good job that last revision, and it's just even better now with the 8th gen CPUs I'm gonna talk about one last thing. It's customer support because I talked about in my previous videos with other devices Razer's customer support is, I would consider a pretty mediocre They're not a laptop company, right? They were originally a peripheral company, and they got into the laptop game And they do a good job at it But their customer support is lacking, and they don't have stuff like next-day support So if you have something with your laptop some companies like Dell and HP They'll send a technician to your house or your work And they'll kind of try to fix it Razer doesn't have that, you have to send it back to them So that's a bit of a bummer. It depends on what you want or need if your laptop support I mean if it's really important to you, then you might want to look elsewhere, But they make great laptops And I think especially their Stealth line is thumbs up, all around. Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video! Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it. See you guys next time!",

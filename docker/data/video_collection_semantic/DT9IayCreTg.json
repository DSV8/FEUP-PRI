    "transcript": "- Hello and welcome to \"This Is\", Matt and I are both sick however, the tech news doesn't stop, and today, today we've got some streaming games to talk about. - Yes, GeForce Now is officially out of beta after how many years? - So we actually did a video on it two years ago at CES. So GeForce Now is NVIDIA's game stream service, in fact it actually launched originally for the Mac, however, a couple years ago at CES they then brought it out to PC and it's been available as a beta since then, however, it is now the full official mode. You actually can do things, like they actually have RTX 2080s in the cloud now so you have ray tracing, and you can pay for it now. Yes. - [Matt] So there is a free version, but for $5 a month they have the premium version, however, you get three months for free when you sign up for-- - [Austin] That's actually not a bad deal. - Not bad at all. But so with the premium version you get the ray tracing, you get priority queuing, and then-- - Because if you're a free newb you have to maybe wait longer to jump into a game. - Right - But the cool thing about GeForce Now is that, unlike something like Stadia, and we're about to give it a try here in a minute, is that you're not really buying games in the cloud, or whatever, you're pretty much just renting a PC, so you're logging into your Steam, or your Origin, or your Uplay, you're playing all the same games that you already have, all the same save files and everything, and you're streaming it to whatever you'd like. So we just signed up for the Founders membership, which again, to be fair, $5 a month and three free months actually is not bad. - [Matt] There's actually a huge amount of really big triple-A titles that are missing because Rockstar isn't on here, EA's not on here, Square Enix isn't on here. - And to be fair, the free plan is actually totally viable. Now yes you miss RTX, but one of the things that's actually really nice about it is you still have an hour record limit, or an hour speed limit? - No, play limit. Which works if you're playing it on a mobile phone or whatever. That's the perfect amount of-- If you're playing this killing time in between class, you're on the bus or whatever. But it you were trying to, say, game at a friend's house, for an hour at a time that's a pretty short limit. - That's not bad - I think that's bad. Theoretically you could just jump back in, right now I think the server's capped at 600,000 or something like that, so let's say there's 700,000 people trying to play, that means there's 100,000 people ahead of you that you have to wait until their time limit has expired before you can get back into the game. Now I used to play WOW Classic-- - Yeah. - And I remember waiting hours at a time to try and get back into a game after logging in. I have no interest in doing that. I don't know how popular this is going to be, but if I have to wait to play the games like that I'm done. - I paid for Founders, and by paying for Founders I mean I'll pay for Founders in three months when my trial is done, so let's give it a try. - [Matt] That's fair. - The settings are really straight forward, you do have a couple of data options so you can do balanced, data saver, or what I really want to try is competitive, which apparently is less bit-rate, but it's a little bit higher- or lower latency I suppose. It says the lowest latency during gameplay, but also you can customize it, so you can change your max bit-rate, which I believe goes all the way up to 50 megabits if you want. - They actually recommend 50. So they say it's somewhere between 15 to 35 to get your 1080/60p, we have great internet here, but not many people have 50 megabits per second internet. - Okay, so I'm just going to leave it on balanced, just to give it a try, I'm going to launch a game here. The cool thing is when it comes to installing theoretically it should actually be really quick because a lot of the games all of them are cached. - [Matt] Yes, it's instant. It's instant. - If I jump into \"F1\" specifically I'm running on a Tesla P40, so it's actually not an RTX 2080, but I think the P40 has RTX cores. Although what's weird is I'm running at 1280x800-- Oh, we just got a spotty connection warning. I have actually played \"F1\" on this laptop on ultra-low setting before, since it doesn't have a dedicated graphics card, that may have just been my Steam settings automatically coming over. I will say, just scrolling through menus, this seems perfectly reasonable. - [Matt] So this looks fine to me, and it kind of has the same appeal that it has with Stadia. At what point is it good enough? So compared to a PC, or even a console, these are not going to be better video qualities, no one's expecting that, but there is-- it's a level of good enough. - So for reference I have played this game at 30fps on this laptop natively, it feels significantly slower than what I'm getting here. Now, mind you, I am getting some stutters, so in fact it just stuttered a little bit there, which might be kind of hard to see on YouTube. Yeah, see, I'm stuttering right now. But I will say, without a doubt, this is a better experience than running it natively on my laptop. So we are playing on a very good Wi-Fi connection, so we're playing on Gigabit Wi-Fi, but it's still wi-fi, and ideally-- Oh, God, this is bad. Should we actually switch over to the optimized mode and see what happens? - Sure. So we'd love to compare one-to-one either \"Red Dead Redemption\" or something like that, comparing the two services, but you can't, because I think the only game that really is on both is \"Destiny\", I think. With Stadia the game library is garbage. - First impressions using the full, real version of GeForce Now, good, not great. So this is the competitive mode. - [Matt] Which, to be fair, is what I feel a lot of eSports players do, is they crank down the resolution to get more FPS. - This actually feels a lot better. Image quality is bad, but if I was playing on my phone it actually probably wouldn't be that bad. - I really think, though, this looks like we got in a time machine and went to PS1. - I mean, we're definitely play at 640p or something. Competitive mode's kind of tough to recommend, because it looks way worse, but it does feel better. I'm not so sure how much of this is to the fact that they're letting the game run at the full 180 frames per second, or whatever. We could plug this in and play over ethernet, but I just don't think that's a fair compromise. No one's going to do that. - [Matt] The people who are going to have a large steam library are the same people who are going to have a gaming PC at home with a wired connection, so why, again, go through the middle man. This is meant for gaming on the go. The guy who has a $200 PC, he doesn't have a gaming PC, for $5 a month you can game now, and just buy your Steam games through this. And that's a good scenario. - So we've now switched over to Stadia with \"Destiny\". So this is the exact same setup, the Dell XPS laptop, we're running inside the Edge browser, although generally speaking you would use Chrome. So what's interesting when you compare GeForce Now to Stadia is that GeForce Now you do not pay for any games. So you purely pay for the streaming service if you like, or you can use the free version, whereas with Stadia there is a free version, actually, is it out yet? Or it's coming out soon, right? - It's coming out soon. - So right now you do have to pay a monthly fee for Stadia Pro, as well as purchase the games, however, once the games are available you can do the free version. - [Matt] Having played this a lot on PlayStation this feels exactly the same to me. - [Austin] It looks just like you're playing on a console right now. - [Matt] Yeah, I don't see any tearing, I don't see any compression, this looks great, it feels great. - So I guess one advantage with \"Destiny\" specifically is that you're running at 1080p/60 as opposed to 30 frames per second on console. So it is definitely sort of the hybrid between the next-gen consoles and the current gen consoles, in that front. At the end of the day streaming games is not a replacement for a console, and it is not a replacement for a PC, it is an addition. And I think that there is only so much market share available. Someone's not going to say, \"I'm going to go throw my Playstation in the garbage \"because Stadia's so good.\" Or, \"I'm going to go throw my game PC in the garbage \"because GeForce Now is so good.\" You are playing these streaming games realistically when you are on the go, or if you have very low-end hardware, where you can't actually play these games at full settings like you would on a console or PC. So after spending some time with both Stadia, as well as GeForce Now, I think that there are a couple of key takeaways. First of all, I appreciate that you do not really need to pay for GeForce Now. Especially if you already have games, but of course, there are a lot of games, such as Fortnite, that are free to play. I'm going to give GeForce Now a little bit of credit, not much, but a little bit of credit, considering that this is day one, a lot of people are probably flooding the service, they are probably having some bandwidth issues, and I know in previous demos of GeForce Now it actually has performed a little bit better than this, but Stadia, right now, actually is a better gaming experience. Still though it's a tougher sell, and until that free play comes out it is really hard to recommend that over GeForce Now. - The one thing that I do really like about Stadia over GeForce is that it just works on Chrome. You don't have to download anything, whereas this you do. I mean, you could go to your local library computer, or whatever. That's a useful feature, but again, until the get that library up it's not a service that I can even recommend, and I'm one of their biggest supporters. I got my Founder's editions right there on the stage here, and it's going to stay there until they improve their library. - So I'm very curious, what do you guys think about GeForce Now versus Stadia? Let us know in the comments below. Definitely be sure to subscribe to \"This Is\", and until next time, Matt, are you ready to go back to PlayStation 1 graphics? - I mean, that's what we just played with \"F1\", so-- - I know, I'm going to play more of that now. - If they had \"Tony Hawk's\" on here--",

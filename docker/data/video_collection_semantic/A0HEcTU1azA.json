    "transcript": "this is the cheapest laptop with an OLED in it now straight off the bat I don't know if that's necessarily true because Asus also makes this thing which has an OLED in it and is a bit cheaper but does that count is that a laptop it's like a weird tablet hybrid Abomination uh whereas this is unambiguously a laptop so um yeah maybe this does count is the cheapest one either way in today's video I'm gonna do the thing I do to everything I buy was just gonna try a game on it but first today's video is sponsored by Corsair and their massive box of new IQ link things now in my opinion most RGB stuff has two major Achilles heels price and cable help I really hate that cable health and corsair's new IQ link solves one of those problems with IQ link you can easily daisy chain the whole system's worth of individually controllable RGB craft using one cable run this one cable power and datas all this stuff so if you're an oil Baron that wants a much easier RGB system building experience click on the link down below [Music] now straight off the bat why do I care about a relatively basic laptop with an OLED in it well in my experience when it comes to relatively basic laptops manufacturers tend to just use a display they found in a dumpster behind their Factory whereas aside from a couple of shortcomings like burn-in and potential Max brightness oleds tend to be very good displays so does that mean that if you put an OLED in a relatively basic laptop that it massively elevates The Experience well let's find out now the cheapest OLED laptop in question is the Vivo book which I think in Asus speak means Normie laptop the VivoBook random area code which in terms of Hardware even putting aside the OLED is packing some interesting new stuff the box to pop the laptop out when you open it up like the strix packaging does but I guess because it's a Vivo book I have to stick my finger in the box like some kind of animal [Music] a tiny very portable little power brick with a real thin cable that isn't replaceable which I'm not a big fan of because if you're a cat for example choose this cable you're kind of screwed and in terms of accessories that's all you get and then here is our laptop oh I don't love that logo bulge it looks a bit like branding on tracksuit pants I don't know and aside from the Bulge on first impression the build quality feels quite 2012. it's it's not great when it comes to IO we've got some ports on the right side including a full HDMI which is nice and then on the left side we have a port singular so again not a whole lot of i o but enough to get you going you know now on the back we've got some ventilation with a heat pipe poking through which is nice to see there's also some some rubberized feet which will hold the laptop in place and we've got what looks like a relatively easy bottom plate to get off for some upgrades which we'll check out later on oh and finally in terms of the bottom we have downward facing speakers which is a bit of a cardinal sin for laptops in my opinion because nothing shouts Clarity like an audio Source pointed straight at a table oh wow that really does not pass the one I know whoops and then we have the inside of the laptop which ah now all this thing is hewn out of some pretty garbage plastics it's kind of in line with other laptops I've seen at this price point so I can't be too hard on it wow not not a great keyboard but luckily it does have a numpad I'm going to refrain from making jokes about the type of people who like using numpads because I've beaten that horse to a pulp oh this is a nice touch they've done the Lenovo thing of giving you a little slider to close off your webcam to help relieve paranoia while consuming naughty things on the internet that's good first impressions may not be particularly impressive but it's in line with other devices at this price point and besides that's not its selling point so let's fire it up and try out its Cod piece oh always always forget [Music] oh Asus is very excited about the OLED in here because it's it's quick to remind us that it's there and it's a smart logo because there's like black and white next to each other so you can see the just amazing contrast uh now in terms of bloatware it's got some McAfee on here which is very mean to the the Facebook users that would buy this laptop other than that there's not a whole lot of VD on here which is good now in terms of specs aside from the OLED this laptop's still pretty interesting it's got one of the new low powered ryzen chips in here I'm curious to see how that's going to handle gaming especially with the eight gigs of ddr5 in here and hopefully upgrading that Ram will give us more performance but we'll see about that later on and again quick note I know this isn't a gaming laptop but you know it's always interesting to see what it can do it's a good power test you know uh who's maybe expecting a little bit better than what's happening here now I know we have a u-series Apu in here but I would not call this a playable CS go experience like maybe against bots it's okay but you would get railed online there's way too much input lag and you can see the stutter going on here although the display is lovely like it's it's really good after which I tried Doom Eternal which just straight up crashed after launching and after a couple attempts I decided to move on okay so with Battlefield 5 at 1080p low settings I mean I don't know if I'd call this running but it's launched you know this this the game is happening uh visually the game looks pretty good it's not a little over saturated I'm curious to see how this display is going to measure we'll do that in a bit uh but let's see what 720p does we're still not getting 24 frames oh actually no no it's it's still under 24 frames per second okay I then decided to try a new game I've been playing recently which actually seems potentially appropriate for this little laptop [Music] now I am very curious to see how battle Pit's gonna run on this laptop because this perfect game for potatoes you know um well I mean it's running a lot better than Battlefield 5 was which is not super surprising uh I do still have the option to drop the settings down to potato oof it's still not running great it feels really heavy I kind of think we've got some Ram issues going here and battle bit also really accentuates that over saturated look on this display so before I try and upgrade the RAM in here let me quickly measure the display and see what we're working with the display measures in a word spectacularly although there were some slight gamma issues which weren't calibrated made a bit of a difference to the colors the display does have quite a glossy surface but it goes bright enough to overcome that indoors at least either way the display does make for a very nice content consumption experience but with that let's try and open it up and see what happens okay well now we actually get to open it up and I can already see some promising things we've got a ram stick kind of shining through the bottom here so yeah I'm just hopefully we can upgrade some stuff foreign oh I just realized my hands are a bit chocolatey so I need to go wash them before before I touch the insides of the laptop give me a second still don't have a just a just a glory hole but I don't know if we're ever getting those back I don't know if that's the thing the laptop manufacturers are ever gonna do again because the alternative to an upgrade glory hole is this oh there we go and um oh oh no that wasn't a ram stick it was it was an it was an nvme drive and the ram is all solder down like what the I even went out and bought Ram do you know why because I trusted you and then dude what did you do with that trust you kicked it in the dirt so um yes this I don't care about anymore you can have a look at it and decide for yourself what you think about the rest of the laptop things in here but I am just disappointed Aces just disappointed so at the end of the day the Glorious display in this Plastic Fantastic does elevate the experience of watching YouTube videos and flaming people on social media but for committing the cardinal sin of not only just putting eight gigs of ram in a laptop in 2023 but then soldering it down so there's nothing you can do about it aces can very much go sit in the naughty Corner again [Music] foreign [Music]",

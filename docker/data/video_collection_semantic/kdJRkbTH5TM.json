    "transcript": "- Today we're at Kualoa Ranch. This is one of my favorite places in Hawaii. It is so beautiful. It's 4,000 acres. They've shot so many amazing movies here. (chill music) If you've seen a movie where it looks like it's a Hawaii setting, there's a really good chance, they shot it here at the ranch. We're about to do an ebike tour. When we booked this tour, we thought that it was going to be a fully electric bike tour, but it's pedal assist. And this place is over 4,000 acres. We're about to hop on, and this is going to be an iPhone XR Vlog. So most of the clips will be iPhone XR, but I'm kind of afraid to mount this, so I'm going to mount on of my 360 cameras and GoPro, and I'll intercut some footage there. Everything about this place is just so magical. If you guys are ever in Oahu, please go visit Kualoa Ranch. I promise you, you will not be disappointed. So we're out on an assisted electric mountain bike tour. I don't know what's going to happen. I've got a GoPro, I've got a 360 camera. I've got so much tech on me. It is probably going to be the death of me. Not the bike, or the mountain, my technology. (chill techno music) Oh my gosh! Do you remember what this place was? - I do it's where you got scared. - You scared me so bad. - I scared you so good. - This is where Jenna and Matt scared the crap out of me. I was in here, just like making a video and talking about some stuff and then, you guys scared me so-- - You got a little boo! That's when pranks were cool, ya know. (upbeat music) (Justine screaming) - [Justine] Oh my god! I hate you! - [Matt] Did we actually get you? - You actually did. What are we doing now? - Hey. - Hello, that's our new friend. Dalton, is that correct? - [Jenna] I was just about to say, do you remember his name? - I do, I remember, but he said we could call him-- - [Jenna] Where's he from? - New Port Beach. - There you go! - It's an honor and a privilege. - [Jenna] This bunker was completed two years after the war. - So that means, it was not efficient. I just want to show you what I got here. GoPro, phone, water, 360 camera. This is what we call tech fashion. Hi Brea. - What's up. (mellow music) - [Justine] My god, I'm so strong, aw shoot. (mellow music) Tell me a better show, tell me about it. Tell me a better show than Lost. - No, I can't. - [Justine] There isn't one. (chill techno music) This is where Jen and I flew our drones one of the other times that we were here, and oh my gosh. The views are just so breathtaking. (chill techno music) This is so beautiful. This is a bunch of shots where they filmed Jurassic Park and Jumanji. Oh right there! There's a Jumanji sign! One of my favorite movies, so good. (upbeat music) I keep wanting to use this phone on the bike tour, but I'm so afraid I'm going to drop it because I don't have a case for it yet. And I am very nervous. (upbeat music) (Brea laughing) Brea, what did you do? - [Brea] I don't know. - [Justine] Brea's bike is broken. And we're out of radio cell service. So, Brea's chain just broke, and like it actually broke, broke. It didn't just pop off. It's split. Jenna had a really great idea. - I did. - Let's test it out. The iPhone XR detects people when you're taking the portrait mode. So she said, will it detect this person? - [Jenna] You'd do a better job. - I don't think it's, but it's not a person. - [Jenna] You're right, it was just a thought. It's okay, we tried. (upbeat music) - [Justine] This is a true ranch hero right here. In case you didn't hear him, he said, not all super heroes wear capes. Some wear green shirts. - We're almost there. - [Justine] You got this. - [Jenna] Are you telling yourself that? - Yeah. (upbeat music) As I bring our iPhone XR Vlog to a close, I just want to give you guys a quick little demonstration of what it's like to Vlog on here, what some of the footage looks like. Did you guys order a an iPhone XR? If you did, let me know on the comments below what color you got. And if you didn't, what color would you get? I'll see you guys later. Say good-bye to the horsies. (upbeat music) I just finished editing this video, and I thought that you guys are probably going to have some questions about how I did the fish eye effect and a bunch of those other hyperlapse things. I did use that 360 camera that I mentioned before. It's the Instant 361X and I did use my iPhone Xs to edit those, and then I imported those into final cut to finish editing this whole Vlog, so, technically, this Vlog was pretty much all done on an iPhone. I'm pretty impressed. Again, thanks for watching and look for my unboxing of all of the XR colors coming very, very shortly. As soon as UPS drops them off. And I film the video and edit it. It'll be up here for you guys to enjoy. Until then, I'll see you later. And that's it. I think that's all I wanted to tell you. (Justine laughs) See ya! (upbeat music)",

    "transcript": "- Hey guys! How's it going? It's Justine, and today I am so excited because this is a very special unboxing. This is part advice, part unboxing, video. I partnered with the Microsoft Store to talk to you guys about things that I wish that I had known when I went to school. They also let me pick out some things from the Microsoft Store that I wish that I had when I was in school, and these are some of the items that I picked. For a little bit of a context, I went to a tech school, so it was a two year school, so basically, you went to school for two years straight. You had a little bit of a break in the summer, but maybe like two weeks or something. And then it was right back to work. So what was cool about this program that I did is it was very very dedicated, very focused, to the things that I was most interested in learning. Obviously, if you can guess by my career path, I went to school for design, video production, we also did 3D, we did web development, we did so many things in those two years, but I also want you to remember that this was a long time ago. It feels like a very long time ago, I think I graduated in 2004. But what's been great about that is seeing the technology change so quickly. So before we start this unboxing, my number one tip that I wish I would've told myself, was to save all of your files, backup all of your data, all the time, as soon as possible, as often as you can. Because now, I wish that I had the photos back that I took in school, I wish that I had those project files that I worked on. I do have some, a lot of the websites back then, they don't even exist now, so places that I had uploaded photos to, or project files, they don't exist anymore, so I have no way to have that information back. Save and save often, especially in a field where you're doing a lot of projects. In Photoshop, in Final Cut, in Premiere, thankfully now, auto save is a very prevalent feature, where back then, that wasn't a thing. If you didn't save and save often, you'd be in trouble. And unfortunately, I was not one of those that saved often. One piece of tech that I wish I had was this. This isn't an unboxing because I've talked about this many, many times, is something like this. This is the Surface Book 2. I absolutely love this, especially because I'm a designer, this little guy would have been quite the savior because not only is it a computer, it's also a tablet. I chose these items to go with my Surface, this is one of the Microsoft Surface Arc Mouses, mice? And I also got this one, it's like Pro Mouse. And to go with this Surface Book because this pops off. Okay there's a lot of stuff here. And turns into a tablet. If I had this back when I was doing illustrations, I can't even, I just, I don't want to be one of those elderly people that's like back in my day, because back in my day, I don't even wanna tell you the things that we had to do. Our computers were running so slow, I was storing things on zip drives, could've been worse, I could've been storing them on floppy drives. Or it could've even been way worse, if they didn't even have computers, we dead. So let's unbox these guys. Gotta put all my items over here. This mouse, I'm so excited about this. So this mouse I'll probably actually end up using with my Surface Studio because I really like that it has extra buttons here on the side, and this nice precision wheel. That is so smooth, oh this thing is fantastic. I didn't even know they had this. It's so cool, because to turn it on, you just bend it. And it form fits to your hand! Oop! Actually looks like it's gonna match my knife perfectly. One of the other tips that I would tell myself, that I wish that I had known when I was in school, I feel like I was a little bit antisocial. It wasn't because I didn't want to talk to people, I just felt like I was sort of very secluded and I was a little bit shy, which is kind of shocking because you guys know me as me, this person, on the internet, right now I'm talking to a camera. Real life Justine is a little bit more shy, and she's actually an introvert, talking about myself in the third person. I wish that I would've been a little bit more outgoing, talk to people a little bit more, and made more friends. And I definitely had a lot friends, but I feel like there were people that I didn't talk to because they didn't talk to me, and they also, I think, were shy. So when two shy people are met with each other, it usually doesn't work out that well. So I think that's something that I wish that I would've done, is talk to more people. It definitely matches my knife, everybody needs a stylus that matches their knife. So I worked a lot in college, and it was hard because being a student and then trying to live and survive, that is such a difficult balance. And I feel like that's also a hard balance after you get out of school, but one of the things I did do is I did a lot of freelance work. And what's incredible now is there are so many ways to make money. There are so many things like Postmates and Uber and Lyft, to be able to have those opportunities at your fingertips, take advantage of those. I did a lot of freelance so I was making websites for people and things like that. I wish that the opportunities that you have now, with technology and different ways to have jobs, but you guys do have that available so if you're in that position where you do need a job, there's an app for that. This was something that I got really excited about, and I know it's surprising, but it's Office 365, it's a home subscription. This is the first time I've unboxed a subscription, just let it be known. Has anybody else unboxed a subscription? So this also works with Windows and Mac, which is great because I can put this on my Mac and my PC. This is great because you can get up to five users. What's gonna be inside here? I'm assuming that this is my download code right here? My product key is here, shh. You can't see it, it's a secret. Another thing that I wish that I had known, or told myself, is health is very, very important. I feel like I definitely, I don't wanna say that I let myself go in college. Thankfully, I do have a very fast metabolism that I did not eat very healthy. And I think that's something that is so important, and it is hard to do as a college student. In the major that I was in, I was sitting on the computer hours and hours, and I'm still sitting on it hours and hours in a day, but trying to find that fine balance between work, working out, and trying to somewhat eat healthy, was a huge struggle, so I wish that was something that I did pay a little bit more attention to. And I didn't, but it's never too late to start. I've been eyeing these up for awhile, these are the QuietComfort 35 II noise-canceling headphones. Most likely, you probably have roommates, and sometimes they may be a little bit difficult to get along with, if you do have incredible roommates, you guys are so lucky. I thankfully didn't have very bad roommates at all. I would be editing a lot, and I would be able to hear everything. I had to share a room with a girl, and we were very, very close together, so I sort of had this bed that was overtop of my computer, so it was kind of like bunk beds. My bed was on the top, computer was in the bottom, and then she was right next to me. And I would be up editing and working very, very late into the night, so being able to have these noise-canceling headphones, I wouldn't be able to hear anything, which I didn't have then, so it was a problem. I was a college student and there was absolutely now way that I could even afford these. Trying to save money, trying to work and really make ends meet and also have time to do other things, a lot of people do struggle with finding the job, and finding the career path, and finding ways to make money, it isn't easy, but finding that passion and finding a love for the work that you're doing is so important, so whatever it is that you absolutely love, whatever it is that you're passionate about, find a way to make that your career, whatever it is. All my life I have absolutely loved video games, I have loved making videos, I've loved making people laugh and smile and just being able to take technology and make it sort of my job, has been such a dream come true. And I just wish that for absolutely everyone, to find that thing that it is that makes you happy, and be able to do that. Oh, oh wow! Oh man, I love the smell of new tech. It's just, it's just a dream! Um okay, well download the Bose Connect. Okay, turn my product on, okay I gotta turn it on. This is gonna be the longest video ever. Ready to pair, oh my gosh okay, I hear it talking to me. Oh I love that it has the R and the L in there, too bad I get my lefts and rights confused, I don't wanna talk about it. Whoa! Baby! I haven't had a pair of noise-canceling headphones in such a long time. Play Klangstof, Everest. I haven't had a good pair of headphones in a very, very long time. I was just doing that so I can make a GIF out of it. Okay, well wow I must've been yelling. These are shockingly incredible, now how do I work this thing? Do I put you back like that? Next up is the Razr phone, I'm actually really excited about this, I was gonna unbox it here but I feel like this is gonna be something that I do really wanna do a dedicated video for. But, I cannot wait to try this out. I was so surprised when I saw this was on the Microsoft Store. I still could not believe all of the things that they had on there. I mean, yes they did sponsor this video, but I am still shocked at the amount of things they had. Because before this, when I think about the Microsoft Store, I would just think about buying Xbox games or things like that, but they have a lot of products. But look for this in a later video, because I feel like this video's gonna be so long. But speaking of cellphones, when I was in school, I didn't even have a phone. My mom actually had to make me get a phone, because she wasn't able to get in touch with me. So she gave me one of her old Motorola, it was like the star something-or-other, I don't even remember what it was, but it was her old phone and then as soon as I discovered text messaging, I was like this is life changing. Do you guys remember T9? I was so fast, I was just going like that. I wonder if my mom still has that phone. But this is definitely a piece of advice that I would give myself if I was going to school now, whatever you post on the internet, it does not go away. You might wanna think twice about your future self because you may completely, entirely, ruin your life by posting something on the internet. If you think for a second you shouldn't post it, don't post it. That is my advice to you guys. Moving along, to our last piece of tech, that I am incredibly excited about. I've seen these in several people's YouTube videos before, in the backgrounds of their videos, and I didn't even know what it was. This is the JBL Pulse 3. It's a portable Bluetooth speaker, but what is great about this is it lights up. I can't wait, this is so cool. Another piece of advice that I would give to my future self, or to you guys, school is tough, but real life is way more difficult. Learn as much as you can, but just know that the things you do learn in school, most of the times a lot of that stuff, you're not ever even going to apply it in your real life, in your career. But a lot of times the stuff that you're learning, it's stuff that you have to do just to get through classes. Finish those courses, honestly learn as much as you can. If there's something that you're interested in, find a class, take a class in that thing. There are so many things that I'm thinking about now, like I really wanna start taking some coloring classes. I've been looking into taking DaVinci Resolve classes. And to be able to have that all at your fingertips, at a school, at a university, is really incredible. I think what's great is, no matter what your age is, you really don't ever have to stop learning. You can basically learn anything from the internet. JBL, I hope that you have some power. Cause that cord's not working. (JBL speaker makes noise) Oh my gosh. This is amazing. Another thing that I definitely wish that I had learned or knew, a lot of people learn differently. I don't learn the same as most people do, I was not a very good book person, you could put a book in front of me, and I could read it and then take a test, and I would probably fail. So listening to audio, and things like that, so a lot of times I wish that I would've recorded some of my classes, and been able to just sort of go back and listen. That's how I learn, you can figure out the way that you learn best, and apply that to your classes. That is such an important thing. JBL, I'm looking for you, oh here you are. Yes, yes, yes, okay. Whoa, looks like something I can just drink. This is something that Starbucks should have. They should have JBL Pulse 3 drinks. Play Klangstof, Everest. No, oh my god, I'm calling Dr. Everick. No, I don't even know a Dr. Everick! (\"Everest\" by Klangstof) This thing's really cool. So this kind of reminds me of a modern day lava lamp. I don't know if you guys remember the lava lamps, but they were really cool when I was in school. Everybody had them, if you went into somebody's dorm room or apartment, I think everybody had one. Guys, thank you so much for watching. I know this was kind of a random video. If I can leave you with any piece of advice, is have fun and learn as much as you can in school. And the people that you meet there, you never know when you're gonna run into them later in life. It is kind of cool to see, especially now with social media and Facebook and Twitter and everything, is you get to stay with these people. You will always know what someone is up to, if they're posting, of course, cause not everyone is on social media, which is kind of crazy when I meet somebody when they're like, I don't tweet, I don't post on Instagram, I'm like well, who are you? How do you do that? I would love to hear from you guys some of your school struggles, what is some advice that you guys would give people going back to school? Leave those in the comments below, and I look forward to reading them. Also, let me know what's your major? What are you going to school for? What did you go to school for? It is also kind of crazy because you can go to school for something and then never actually do that thing, like my sister, she went to school for, oh my god she has like three degrees or something, like speech pathology, a biology degree, and a forensics degree, and now she's making YouTube videos. You never know, the world is your oyster. I tried to think of a motivational quote, I don't think I did a very good job. Anyway, I'll see you guys later, bye.",

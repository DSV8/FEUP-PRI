    "transcript": "hello good people Eber here with Hardware Canucks and guess what it's second-generation Ryzen performance review day yeah I'm not sure if that sounded right but regardless I'll be walking you through my experience testing out the new Ryzen 7 2700X CPU and of course I'll be sharing my performance results compared to my 1700X sitting right behind me my workstation PC because you know and perhaps come to a conclusion as to whether or not if it's actually worth upgrading because the specs on the 2700X are pretty good I mean it's not significantly better than its predecessor but it's still worth finding out especially if you're an existing rise in a system owner and if you're you know rocking one of these are not this but the 1700X CPU I'll also be talking about my overclocking experience with this new processor and of course talk about the new architecture and the new platform which is X470 so let's dive in right after this are you ready okay watch this so that is what the components must feel like inside the H 500 P measured by Coolermaster check it out in the description below alright so before we move on to the performance results I wanted to briefly talk about the news n+ architecture and what AMD has done to improve the performance of these new second-generation Ryzen CPU's first and foremost these processors are based off a new 12 nanometer process but they've only done a few optimizations to improve Layton sees so don't confuse Zen+ with Zen 2 that's not the case here what they've done here is increased the IPC by roughly 3% improved l3 cache latency by 16% and better memory latency by 11% so these new Ryzen CPU's won't have a problem supporting faster memory speeds Zen+ also brings a few more improvements like top clock speeds have been lifted by 250 megahertz so theoretically you won't have a problem achieving 4.35 gigahertz on your best core and all core over clocks round out to about four point two gigahertz and we'll get to the results later on AMD has also managed to lower power consumption by 11% when compared to last generation processors at the same clock speed this could potentially give us a more thermal Headroom for overclocking as well which is nice they've also made some enhancements with precision boost - and xfr - or in other words extended frequency range - let's start with precision boost so expect substantial clock speed increases in multi-threaded workloads again with the new tall nanometers n+ technology these processors can achieve higher frequencies with the same power consumption compared to 1st gen Ryzen so essentially expect turbo clocks reaching as far as 4.3 gigahertz and stock settings XF r2 has now been applied to all cores on these new CPUs so now the algorithms can automatically detect it there's thermal Headroom and we'll apply the frequency boost automatically on all course provided you have adequate cooling in the first place let's take the 2700X for instance AMD has included this rate prison cooler that features an RGB ring and RGB fan and an RGB logo complete RGB over here plus it features direct contact heat pipes and overall it looks like a beefier out of the schooling solution when compared to Intel's offerings speaking of Intel if you decide to become an 8700K right now you won't find a cooler included which is something to note especially since you're paying $50 more than the 2700X yet you're only getting six cores and twelve threads I do plan on putting the 2700X to the 8700K to see how had how well they do head to head so stay tuned for our full performance analysis video later on you know that that just had to happen anyways so there's the new wraith prism cooler that comes out of the box with the new Ryzen 7 2700X CPU that's directly from AMD and it comes with two LED zones so you have this ring that goes around the fan and of course the LED fan by itself and you can control this either through MSI's mystic light software which is you know this motherboard or you can use cases or the only thing is that you can control these zones through those protocols you'll have to obviously use in these dedicated software which interestingly enough is a partnership with Coolermaster so that's pretty interesting and as you can see it gives full control of the cooler you can adjust the lighting through this software I'll leave a link to the download page for this software in the description down below just in case and by the way I had to contact an AMD PR rep to figure out how to control the lighting zones through for the Wraiths prism cooler because out of the box aimed he doesn't give you any proper instructions so all you get is obviously the Box the cooler the cables the CPU and this manual sheet which or this instruction sheet and and it doesn't give you proper instructions as to where to find the software link or where you're supposed to go and download it from it is frustrating I wish they included that in the instruction sheet but at least now you know where where you can go find it so you're welcome alright so let's switch gears and discuss a little bit about X470 this isn't a major upgrade over the X370 platform to be honest because the only difference is an improved power infrastructure for achieving higher clock speeds with these new processors and the introduction of store mi technology it's basically a storage software that fuses two or more storage devices so in this case it could be your SSD and hard drive plus ram into a virtual disk so the operating system reads it as a single Drive this is compatible with nvme SATA and 3d crosspoint drives and it can be installed and reversed at any time provided you have backed up your data beforehand store mi is an enhanced algorithm that learns your computing habits and it moves frequently accessed blocks in this case applications and files between the array giving users a speedy experience I still have to play around with this program to give you guys my full verdict on this because AMD is still finalizing on the software which should be available by the time this video goes live so that would be a cool investigation video for another time to quickly go over the test bench setup over here I have the Ryzen 7 2700X setting on an MSI gaming m7 X470 motherboard I'm also using 16 gigabytes of G skills Sniper X memory it's a 16 gigabyte ddr4 kid it's a weighted speed as 3400 megahertz which is kind of crazy and interestingly enough I was able to boot the 2700X at that speed which is great unfortunately the 1700X can only go as far as 3200 megahertz so for the stock to start comparison what I'll be doing is using exact same memory kit at the same space so 32 hundred megahertz on the 2700X and the 1700X and to even make things even fair to avoid as much as variables as possible I will be swapping out these 1700X CPU from my editing PC onto this motherboard so that we have pretty much identical hardware and do more of an apples-to-apples comparison as for a cooling solution I will be testing the 2700X initially with stock settings we're using the stock cooler that they provided and of course I'll be running on my benchmarks and if you know overclocking capabilities if I'm not successful with the stock cooler but I will be doing is I will be taking out the D15 cooler from my editing workstation PC and I'll be installing it on this test bench over here to see how far it can push the overclock and so now it's about time to overclock this CPU so I'm gonna be using the stock cooler just to see how far I can push the overclock because hey they've included a cooler in the box so it's good to see or good to know we're good to find out how far can you actually push the clock speed on the 2700X so I'll be using AMD's new Ryzen master version 1.3 software and named a few tweaks here so first and foremost they've given us this gold star per course so this is basically your best core that you can work around with especially if you're planning on just overclocking it if you're planning on doing a single core overclock this is something that will help you identify which one of the cores is the best in this case it's this one over here and I've learned from AMD that during the production process AMD preloads that map to the CPU and therefore when you launch the advisor master software it'll show up right away which as to which one of these cores are your first batch first big and then moving on you have your silver star here which is your second best core and the rest and this little silver silver dots over here so yeah I'm gonna be playing around with Ryzen master software to see how if I can push this overclock should be pretty straightforward I'm hoping I can achieve four point two to four point three gigahertz we'll find out so yeah let's do this okay so I've been spending about an hour trying to play around with the overclock with a stock cooler and I was unfortunately not lucky enough to get a solid stable result I first tried 4.2 gigahertz at one point four to five volts and luckily enough Cinebench ran successfully I got a score of 1881 I believe which was impressive but I did run the Ida 64 fpou stress test and the system almost crashed halfway through so that wasn't stable I did try multiple configurations 4.1 4.1 to 5 I play around with a voltage and this was all to rise in master software it's actually a fairly it's fairly straightforward but I was unfortunately unlucky and I did try playing around with the BIOS as well to see if I can maybe fit along with some settings so the SOC voltage and just see if the BIOS would help but that didn't work out that great so what I'm gonna do is swap the stock lower for a beefier heatsink like the Noctua D15's I'm gonna run these tests again I'm pretty sure I should be able to get a stable overclock because it's a beef your heatsink it can pretty much handle anything you throw at it which is great so yeah let's do that so this is one of the downsides to a PGA socket it's not as secure as what Intel offers so you know when you decide to pull an air core off your motherboard there's a very good chance that the CPU can just come with it so just make sure if you don't find that CPU in there yeah it's definitely over here that's definitely all right so I've successfully overclocked the 2700X to 4.2 gigahertz with a core voltage of 1 point 4 to 5 volts and I'm running the Adobe premier test as the encoded test I'm running in 4k 12 minute project GHI footage by the way so it's really stressing the CPU as you can see the core clock speeds are at 4.2 gigahertz so after a successful 4.2 gigahertz overclock on the 2700X I ran some synthetic real-world and some gaming tests on this processor compared to stock settings and of course throwing in the 1700X as well so here are the numbers starting with Cinebench r15 running the CPU test lead 2700X at stock settings with the stock cooler by the way scored a little over 1,800 points that's 20% more performance compared to these 1700X at stock settings the 4.2 kicker's overclocked on the 2700X with the memory speed bumped up to 30 400 megahertz give us a score of 1886 so it's pretty darn impressive if you ask me switching to OpenGL and we see that the lower clock speeds on these 1700X becoming a bottleneck at stock settings I got around a little over 100 frames per second compared to 118 frames per second on the 2700X at stock this is all thanks to xf r 2 being applied on all 8 cores along with the faster IPC overclocking the 2700X to 4.2 gigahertz give us a hundred 24 frames per second blender running the BMW scene took 5 minutes and 10 seconds to complete on the 1700 X compared to 4 minutes and 26 seconds on the 2700X so it's roughly 16% faster overclocking the 2700X to 4.2 gigahertz saves a little bit of time as well not by that much but at least it's something same story goes for 3dmax Corona the 2700X takes the lead here once again at stock settings completing the render 18 seconds faster than the 1700X the 4.2 gigahertz OC shaves a little bit of time but once again not too significant povery really didn't show that much of an improvement with the 2700X as a results compared to the OC setting and the 1700X and stock are barely noticeable moving on to some real-world tests I take a one-minute 4k timeline exported it to YouTube 4k preset using Adobe Media encoder and as you can see there isn't a significant difference between these 1700X and it's 2700X at its OC saying we're talking maybe six second difference between the three but rendering a 12-minute project using the same 4k precent shows a little bit of improvement the 1700X at stock completes that task by around 22 minutes compared to 19 minutes and 34 seconds on the 2700X the 4.2 gigahertz overclock definitely shaved off a few minutes which is pretty nice but realistically speaking it's all about the experience editing a video and personally I did notice a huge difference in that regard which is a little disappointing okay so moving on to some gaming benchmarks and I hate to spoil it right now but honestly don't expect better frame rates with this new processor sure you'll get slightly better 3dmark scores like what you see here with time spy and fire strike but throughout my testing period I didn't notice a significant increase in frame rates at least through my naked eye take Battlefield one for instance set two 1440p Ultra settings we see five percent increase compared to the 1700X I'd like to reiterate that memory speeds were sent to 3200 megahertz just to give an apples to apples comparison overwatch at 1440p set to epic yielded roughly the same frame rates on both the 1700X and the 2700X so nothing spectacular here dumat 1440p set to ultra using the Vulcan API once again yields us same results on both CPUs and in this case around 177 frames per second with 8 gtx 980 ti lastly we have Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon at 1440p set to very high this setting taxes out on the GPU but I noticed a 3% increase in frame rates compared to these 1700X so those results really do speak for themselves guys and personally speaking I didn't notice a huge difference between the 1700X and 2700X just in gaming performance by itself but when you are thinking about synthetic workloads like slave Cinebench or blender you could notice a slight improvement in rendering times when you decide to have weight to the 2700X but in all honesty as I mentioned earlier it's all about the experience what's it like when you're actually working within that program or you experiencing any slowdowns and I personally have noticed a significant difference so that is a little bit disappointing now would I recommend the CPU to anyone who is looking into building themselves and if you were looking for if you're looking to build a workstation PC would I recommend the CPU absolutely because for $329 you're getting an 8 core CPU with 16 threads this thing can overclock to 4.2 gigahertz provided you have you know any i/o solution or an aftermarket like something like the T 15 it just worked right away and the results are fantastic you can get great rendering performance out of a 329 CPU much better than what Intel's offering but if you want an existing Ryzen system owners say for example you're only 1700X if you're thinking about upgrading to rise in two or second generation Ryzen CPU's I hate to say this but I don't think you're gonna notice a significant increase in performance it's just not worth your money so that about wraps up this brief comparison between these 1700X and the 2700X I'd love to hear your thoughts on this new processor what do you guys think about it are you impressed with the performance just not from gaming perspective but more from a synthetic workload perspective are you surprised by the Cinebench scores and the adobe premiere performance let me know the comments down below an e bar with harbor connects thank you so much for watching and we'll see you in the next one",

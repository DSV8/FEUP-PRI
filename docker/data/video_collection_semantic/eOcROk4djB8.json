    "transcript": "so that was interesting I'm currently wearing the cloud orbit s the new headset from HyperX that they're coming in with a clutch because the current gaming headset scene has become like a little bit stagnated as gaming keyboards are getting expensive gaming mice getting lighter and weight you know what's the next cool thing with the gaming headset and I feel like HyperX has got you covered they're finally bringing a little bit innovation into the sector and this thing is a rebrand of the Odyssey Mobius headset but this thing is like the cheaper because it does not have the wireless functionality this is a wired headset only and it's got many cool things working for it so let's check it out right after this a OCS warranty just respawned that covers four years general warranty for any defects including a one-time accidental warranty replacement of vagin monitors because sometimes things happen so you can enjoy a super smooth and responsive gameplay just like the warranty check it out below alright so let me break this down for you the reason why I think this headset is important it's because of the brand HyperX is known for their gaming audio if you ever bought anything gaming in the audio sphere related you most likely have come across HyperX cloud series one way or another and the fact that they teamed up with Odyssey to release a planar magnetic gaming headset is awesome because how many people know about Odyssey probably not many in the mainstream gaming arena but HyperX is by the popular and it's a really good way to kind of channel those planet magnetic drivers into the hands of the mainstream consumers even though it's a very expensive pair the orbit is $2.99 and the orbit SS 329 and the main distinction between the two the $30 premium gets you the waves and the next technology basically the 3d tracking that's built into the headset and I'll talk about that later so you do get that with the orbit s but you do not with the orbit while the Odyssey Mobius sells for 399 and the reason for that markup is because the Odyssey Mobius also has wireless functionality with Bluetooth while this thing does not and that price point I get it will immediately turn off many consumers from even considering or looking something like it but the whole idea is that inclusion of a hundred million of planet magnetic drivers into the gaming market and let me tell you guys these sound incredible the deepest richest based on any gaming had said that I've ever heard the best bass in my experience before these were the GSP 600 from San Heiser nice richness deepness of those lower end but here the planar magnetic driver is just so good at delivering those lower and frequencies that I would say it's like really really nice for music and in a gaming environment it's awesome because it doesn't distort and doesn't overshadow any other frequency that you feel the bass it's almost supposed to be rumbling the headset or the ear cups but it doesn't it's fully controlled and that is awesome so the drivers need a lot of power which is why you see on the Box up to ten hours of usage and that only applies when you use them in analog mode via the 3.5 Miller connection at the bottom in my testing at full power we dropped 20% in two and a half hours so there after 10 hours of runtime is valid now for the price point built quality is okay there's no creaking when trying to flex them size extensions work well the padding on top of the headband on the ear cups is memory foam so they do conform to the shape of your head the clamping force here is a bit strong in the beginning it has loosened over time a little bit but still there's a little bit too much clamping force at the bottom of the headset even though you can slightly extend them and they would fit larger heads no problem just be mindful of the clamping force that's you know they're not HD 5 and X comfortable but they're pretty good for what they are they're also pretty like the 368 grams and my only complaint with the build is the surface texture and the coating it is like a rubberized and matte which is pretty nice to the touch but it reveals all scratch marks reveals all handling marks in terms of the oil and so over time this thing is not going to look pretty now the accessories are pretty basic with a carry pouch a type a Type C cable the type C to type C our analog cable and the removal microphone with a pop filter and so the microphone currently it's a maximum gain and it is noise canceling so as I'm typing on MX keyboard it tries to cancel out and mute all the background stuff without too much compression so there is still nice body to the sound however I feel like this is a condenser microphone so we have to be really close to it for it to pick up enough volume and if I move it a little bit further back then it becomes almost inaudible which is unfortunate given this is maximum gain here's what the GSP 500 sounds like from sanitiser this is one of my favourite gaming headset microphones because it's really natural great bass pickup the only thing it's not noise cancelling so it does pick up more ambient room noise as you can hear I'm typing on the keyboard but as an overall package I feel like this is slightly better than the orbit and the orbit s but you let me know which sounds better to you in the comments all the controls are located on the left ear cup to make sure that your right hand stays on the mouse and that does not need to come off when ever need to change any of the parameters here we have a mic mute we have a power on/off switch that also acts as you play pause at the bottom we have two wheels one for volume adjustment and one for the microphone volume and if you hold and cycle the mic volume you cycle between different EQ presets and if you hold it for three seconds you are actually changing the audio modes between 7.1 channel stereo channel and high res audio then we have our analog 3.5 million or input our type C port microphone input and that 3d button and this 3d mode is only relevant for the orbit s because that features the waves and X technology while the orbit does not and when it is enabled it basically creates this stereo speaker set in front of you that is centered and if you rotate your head accordingly that stereo separation remains locked to the center like this but it changes them dynamically in the actual headset which is pretty cool because you could look away from the source and this speaker will be louder than that one and it gives you that whole realistic scenario of listening to speakers instead of audio being here regardless of your head movement at first it was really cool to experience something like it because it locks off this audio source in front of you or where you set the center channel and so it does shift best based on like where you look but in neither of the situations movie watching games or music has that benefited my listening experience and gaming for example it makes no sense because if you move your head slightly it does change the stereo positioning of the audio which does not give you any benefit in trying to position the audio keys and stuff in movies it again like if you were to look away to talk to somebody you still hear the slightly louder stereo separation but why and the only reason I would see this head-tracking to be beneficial is maybe in VR where an audio source can be locked off so you could be looking back and still hearing something in a properly positioned 3d space around you but when you're sitting physically at the desk how does moving around give you any benefit I don't get it but outside of head-tracking 3d audio for gain immersion is absolutely on point it's one of the only few virtual surround sound modes that I enjoy outside of like the GS X 1000 from Sun hyzer where here the environment does get lucky wider without losing detail you still get a lot of that nice base definition good clarity throughout the entire range and I really appreciate the a bit closeness on the vocals I actually really like watching youtube videos with 3d audio on and I was not expecting that I almost never enable any virtual surround sound in gaming where audio cues are important but I have with this thing in escape from tarkov being able to detect footsteps above me below me on wood glass in the forest whatever and I didn't even realize that 3d audio was on where I could easily tell where some enemies were even in csgo where the awliyas are so well defined already in stereo channels 3d mode and csgo did not suffer now in terms of the software it's a good visual indication on the where and which direction the headset is kind of looking for and you can Center that easily so that you're looking in the screen and that is your center Channel in terms of sound presets all of it is done on the headset itself which is quite nice even when you're running this in analog mode and you can change between them via the mic switch whenever it works I do prefer the default preset and were preset to just warm up those bass tones which are fantastic already and here you can also see the battery percentage and the microphone volume and so in the end the sound quality from the planar magnetic drivers is absolutely incredible for 300 at is expensive but you get the best bass that I've ever heard in the gaming headset with beautiful clarity nice expansion - and really good handling of the DSPs in terms of one 3d audio is enabled and is the only 3d audio virtual surround sound that I enjoy outside of the GS x1000 the microphone quality is a bit disappointing and I'm not a huge fan of the rubberized soft coating that just gets covered in the finger marks and oils and just scratches way too easily for $300 it doesn't feel right the takeaway here is that I hope more companies start to use play no magnetic drivers and their gaming headsets I know that it's going to increase the price point but I mean the gaming Hans's are so expensive already that it doesn't hurt to venture out into more premium driver territory to get better sound I know this thing is going to be not super popular among mainstream because of the price point but for those looking for really good audio solutions that is like a gaming headset in the skies the orbit s or the orbit would be my pick because waivers are the next technology is kind of it's just a gimmick that gives you head tracking but we all know use in any of the scenarios where I tested this thing all right you guys I'm Dimitri thanks for watching make sure to check out this other L in content subscribe for more and talk to you in the next video",

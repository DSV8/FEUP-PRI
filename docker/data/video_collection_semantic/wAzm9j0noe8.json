Will it work or does it suck?  More info from the manufacturer -  Fresh, draft taste from any store-bought beer; Fits most cans and bottles (even 64oz growlers); No separate CO2 or Nitro canisters necessary; Powered by 4 AA batteries (not included)  FOLLOW ME IN THESE PLACES FOR UPDATES Twitter -  Facebook -  Instagram -  Google Plus -",

    "transcript": "Alright, so today I'm pumped up! (pun intended).Seriously! Literately and figuratively. I'm pumped up! We got something called the Fizzics. I'm not sure where this came from if it was like er (thinking too hard)... ...a Kickstarter or wha' i know its on Amazon Launch..Pad..now..though. This thing takes normal beer that comes in a can or a bottle... ...and turns it into a draft beer, or draft like beer. (imitates mind explosion) (Yelling) Which is shocking to me. I... I mean n'... Generally speaking with a draft beer you're gonna... you gonna get a little bit more... ...carbonation. Now they claim here, premium-ization; the physics behind great beer. A fresh from the tap flavor and taste, they dig the science! Runs on a battery and is compatible with all styles of carbonated beer That's what they say you can achieve with the Fizzics beer. Will i be able to tell the difference? We're going to find out, we'll do a blind test. Maybe this thing is a scam, maybe it sucks? Now if you're not a beer drinker i understand. What happens if you put a coca-cola in here, Jack? What do you get, more carbonation? Maybe that's a test for another day! anyway (cutty noises) Oooh this is exciting! This is real exciting! The instruction manual. (discards it) Little err, handle, that so you pull on the top, just like you would if you had a keg. (wrapper noises) Kinda looks like one of those Kurig machines. It kind looks like er... a coffee machine or something. Now the reason it is this size is because it can do a can a bottle and those bigger things like the... ..large bottle you might get from a craft brewery called a, a growler? Are they called a growler? (no Lew they are not. Don't urbandictionary that kids) Is this a lock? (click) Yeah ok. flick up the locks on either side, lift it up... ...and that's it. You have an empty chamber in there and then this little straw goes into you beer source, what ever that happens to be. The other package here contains a base!? This is to keep the unit stable as well as give you a... platform... ...to put you beverage, thats a good look. This guy just kinda (large click)... ...there it is. That has a good look to it. I mean you have this thing at a party, you're hosting a party, you have this on the counter. Alright, now... ...this little guy... that's it You pull down. They said it's battery operated but where? There it is OK. So it takes... ...4 AA batteries. hopefully they have juice in 'em. put you hose into your beverage. Close the lid, lock the clasps. Pull to tap!? and push to top. Woah! Now i have no bar tending experience here so. But apparently you pull it down... ...when you're pouring to tap and then you push it up to top for the fizz. I have (thud) a.. couple cans of beer here right in there now truthfully I probably wouldn't use with a tall can I think the growler concept is kind of nicer because then you can pour a few beers out of it and it just slides in there lock it down got our mighty mugg beer cut remember yeah go check that video if you're wondering what magic that just was so this goes over here pull the poor and push the top 0 bartender experience at play okay here we go coming in hot and then you get to the top and you can what happens if i push the other ways just fall oh really thick did you see that it's like a very dense foam it kinda looks like a guinness or something oh man the difference between the beers own foam and the Fizzics foam can you see that very interesting now my poor probably could have been a little bit better but I'm gonna give it a taste test nonetheless hmm did it taste like draft maybe yeah when you push this thing in the opposite direction let's check it out right when I just want to show you look at the thickness of that foam that is draft style foam the density is completely different than what you get with the bubbles just pouring a can into a into the last fight to tell the difference and then I think that sells the thing on its own ok so Jack has set up these glasses in front of me here I don't know which one is which same can appear one came through the physics machine and one came straight out of the can it's actually quite different ok I'm ready to I'm ready to make my take my guess I think the left hand was the Fizzics one and the right hand was out of the can it was right you can tell the difference it's like a creaminess you can sense the carbonation in your mouth but it's like you could tell the bubbles are smaller and more full more balanced kind of flavor it just tastes a little bit more special both people their preference would lean towards a draft beer so the entire concept here is to bring that experience on to your countertop and I mean I think they've done it now I don't have a third beer that's actually straight out of a draft I would I guess I will need to be at a bar or something like that but certainly this tastes closer to draft beer as they've intended. -For AA batteries this thing- it's not a complicated device I don't know what's going on how they're creating that scenario inside here what science is at play you can let me know in the comments but put this on your countertop host the party be the coolest kid in town and I'd be surprised if you took anything I said seriously over the past couple of minutes because I got the special look going on whatever let's get festive much love",

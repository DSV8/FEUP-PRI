    "transcript": "I haven't been this excited to Rummage in the guts of a bit of tech for a long time because this couple generation old knock has some pretty wild Hardware in a tiny form factor so I can't wait to tear it apart and game on it but first today's video is sponsored by the node or by its new underground street fighting name Akamai lenod Akamai is your One-Stop shop for Linux based Cloud Computing Services and Krav Maga technique related queries just look at this long list of Linux based Cloud Computing Services they offer hmm I can tell you're impressed and this combined with their competitive pricing and award-winning customer support makes the node a no-brainer Choice sign up using the link in the video description to get a 60 day hundred dollar free credit thank you ooh I would take gold PCB Trace gamer skull over hexagons any day of the week having said that it's also covered in gamer guns so this thing's like the gamer Singularity I guess the box that this thing comes in reminds me a little bit of the kind of crate people would have been clinging to for buoyancy when the Titanic went down it's got like a little tassel that you pull out and then it's got the thingies in it look at that said thing is include a bit of power cable an upright desk stand for the knock with a Vasa Mount that's very useful so you can kind of attach it to the back of your monitor and then this is some Plexiglas or acrylic or someone I'm assuming you can like laser etch some custom gamer logo into this to put it somewhere and an absurdly massive power brick it is 230 Watts but that's not an excuse especially when compared to a Razer unit of similar wattage and the Razer power brick is even from an older laptop foreign it looks quite a lot like an AliExpress Mini PC I'm not gonna lie one of the things that gets me really excited about this official AliExpress Mini PC is the i o it has IO in Spades this is just the front around the back we've got even more look at all of it it's even got a full-sized ethernet port on it which is real impressive for a non-cloud gaming device and again it is covered in gamergarns so you know the performance is gonna be serious but something that actually alludes to Performance is all the ventilation you get these tiny peaks of a pretty beefy cooling solution and according to this sticker this Mini PC has some RTX in it which means I think it's time to open it up I am so excited to see the inside of the Intel version of an AliExpress Mini PC oh I like that it comes with the correct size of Allen key for you to open it up with that's very exciting it's the last screw and then oh that just lifts off ooh very cool we've got a bit of skull on the inside of it and I actually think that's what the bit of acrylic that you get with it is for you can change this out to a different pattern then it'll probably light up showing through the semi-translucent bit in the top and then this is the ribbon cable over here that I'm guessing connects the the lighting under that you definitely won't see those details on an AliExpress Mini PC now I guess the first step is to start with number one that makes sense yes there we go that can kind of pop out like that and then under that we're gonna have to unplug the lighting cable can put that aside oh we've got some things that aren't soldered down in here this is our 500 gig Intel optane drive that comes included and there's another nvme slot for more storage and in this interesting connector down here according to Intel's website is an i o connector down here we don't have a pathetic SD card slot it's uhs2 which is very fast and as you probably noticed already it's got dual Channel Ram Straight Out of the Box good job Intel so with that let's see if we can dig deeper I started this process by just undoing all the screws I could find but we're nothing budged after a bit of confused prying I embarrassingly quickly resorted to a teardown tutorial which told me to remove all of the fan connectors and go through the very fun process of removing the microphone array and next I think I need to kind of just break the surround off but despite being a professional plastic surround breaker the process was a lot more difficult than the video LED on yeah yo the guy in the video makes it seem so easy what but with legendary persistence and skill it eventually budged oh okay so we've got the surround bit off we're left with this kind of shell metal basket thing uh which kind of holds the motherboard in place which is the next part that we can kind of lift out now and after undoing a standoff it popped right out into my hands oh oh hey it's loose so that is the the motherboard which we'll have a look at in a second but first I want to show you the pretty substantial fan already these are some big ass blowers uh they're made by everybody's favorite Fan Company Delta so they can probably go 7 trillion RPM which is pretty cool that fin stack would give the average gaming laptop a pretty serious inferiority complex and again the insides of this Intel system makes it seem like the hot older brother of the Ali expresses them I looked at ages ago it's got I think five heat pipes because I think this heat pipe that cools some of the memory and power delivery for the RTX 2060 that's under here it's this is the same heat pipe and then we have our i7 laptop chip in here these internals are really cool let me quickly close it up and then we can try some gaming on it I mean I I feel like the the glowing red eyes is is a nice touch imagine somebody that doesn't know anything about computers turns this on and they're like wait a minute have I been hacked is this one is this what being hacked looks like now when it comes to bloatware with Windows 11 I'd it confuses me a little bit I don't know what of this stuff is just Windows 11 bloatware and one of this stuff is Intel knocker below to wear but this system comes with tick tock on it which I don't know how I feel about that it also has this weird thing called ESPN on it which I'm not I'm not sure I know what that is and while digging around in out of focus land I noticed something worrying the i7 in here is just a quad core I was expecting it to be similar to something like the 11 800h which is an 8 core CPU but they're completely different skus so hopefully that quad core can keep up with the RTX 2060. let's find out thank you as tradition dictates we're starting off with GTA 5 this is with all on high settings at 1080p oh I may have manifest a problem here with my worry because that RTX 2060 is not doing a whole lot with GTA 5. GTA 5 has weird utilization but still that's not a great thing to see and the thing is it's not like we have a heavily kneecapped Ram configuration in here we have 16 gigs of dual Channel RAM and it's even running at its rated 3200 megahertz speed out of the box so yeah we can't like upgrade that to fix this problem let's try a more demanding game and see what that does with Battlefield 5 the problem is not quite as bad we're still getting a little bit of a CPU bottleneck but occasionally we get up to about 90 GPU utilization so there may be a bottleneck but it's not like the graphics cards being maced in the face uh with that let me play for about half an hour so we can see what the temperatures and noise are like yeah I don't know the temperatures are very impressive for a little thing like this and they're nothing like the standard gaming laptop cosplaying as the surface of Venus it's not bad either I'm sitting not particularly far from it I was kind of expecting the SR-71 at takeoff effect of a gaming laptop but it it's not doing that so it's pretty cool although it is a shame to see that CPU bottleneck and the gaming experience is a little stuttery but considering the total system power draw even two odd years after its launch this is still quite a lot of performance per watt this system's performance kind of reminds me of a very specific tier of low end Celeron whereas the igpu and the CPU are very evenly matched in their struggles this is obviously a significantly less terrible example of that because you know we're getting about 66 frames per second at 1080p medium settings with cyberpunk like the system is fast one of the issues here though is that if we wanted to turn something like dlss on to get us a bit more performance it's not really going to help much as you see here because well the GPU power isn't the problem right so we're not going to be getting a lot more frame rate that way on that note let's see what bios options we have available on this little Skull Candy foreign I was kind of expecting something that looked very dos-esque although the fanciness was relatively superficial there was some useful stuff in there but no direct overclocking settings although it did arouse my excitement with a real-time Performance Tuning setting for some desktop overclocking maybe but XTU just is compatible with the Intel CPU in here I could trick the software to install by bypassing compatibility checks but then it would just refuse to launch the closest thing to overclocking I could do to try and alleviate the CPU bottleneck was get the CPU to not clock above 400 megahertz which broke everything so for whatever that's worth thank you for watching this video about a massive power brick that came with a PC in the box and uh until the next video bye-bye",

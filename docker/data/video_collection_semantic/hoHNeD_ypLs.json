    "transcript": "- For this episode of Broke vs Pro, proudly sponsored by Honey of course, our goal is actually really pretty simple. We're each going to try to build the best gaming PC we can, for the least amount of money. Now that is going to involve not only building the systems, but ultimately it all has to come in at a low price point. And at the end of the day, I need to be able to use my system to destroy Ken in some real world games. I'm going to start out at Newegg. Newegg seems like the place to be to try to at least get myself a processor. Oh, here we go. A Ryzen 5 3600, and I've got it on sale for $200, plus a promo code. Ooh. A B450, available for 70 bucks. And Honey says now's the time to buy! It just dropped to the lowest price. Thanks, Honey. Okay. 16 gigs of RAM, 80 bucks. That sounds like a deal, right? Yeah. It's on sale right now. Oh, there's the AeroCool Cyclon. I've actually built in this system before. The case isn't amazing, but it's going to save me like 25 bucks. For $63 I'll have a 500 gig SSD, That'll actually be enough. Okay. We'll go for it.. Let's go graphics cards. This is gonna be the part. Oh, okay. Not even Honey can save us now! Yikes. - Austin thinks that I'm going to go into this Broke vs Pro trying to do some kind of value to performance sort of thing. But my goal out of this game is to just walk away with a really awesome gaming PC that I can use for streaming. I think regardless of whether I win or not, I'm going to win. Just not the game, I'm going to win elsewhere. I'm going to swing for the fences. So why don't we try a fifth gen Ryzen? Let's do like a 5800x. Oh. Well, it's in stock. Wasn't expecting that one. Okay. This is at least the lowest price that we've gotten in the last 30 days. So I'll take it. 5800X. Why not? Technically this is not being sold by Newegg directly, but for 144 bucks, I do like the 011D Mini, I liked building in it. So what is my price difference here? It hasn't changed all that much. 144 bucks. I mean, I'm sure that's a little bit over retail, but, eh. It's not my money. I don't. (laugh) It's not my money, that's yeah, whatever. - So right now, before promo codes and everything like that, I'm at $390, plus $110. That is a $500 system. The only thing I'm missing here is a graphics card. And I should probably put a few dollars toward making the system look cooler, and I'm gonna try to find a graphics card somewhere. Oh, not on walmart.com! I'm not, a 1030 for $173? (groans) Okay. Staples has some stuff that's not completely blown up, but all of it is very low end, yeah. 3080, all that stuff, out of stock, out of stock, out of stock. What about Office Depot? Out of stock, out of stock! Okay. What about eBay? eBay, eBay. eBay. We'll go with eBay. I mean, I'm going to assume that all of these are going to be mining cards, and I don't care. That's fine. I will take a mining card. A 980 Ti for 400 bucks. Okay. Just bear with me for a second here, right. This clearly has been a very well used card, but, if I could get a power supply that can handle it, that might be okay. - Hey, what happens if I type in graphics card on Amazon? GTX 1660 for $600? That is absolutely awful. Yeah, this is all terrible. Okay. Amazon's not the answer. What about Newegg? I'm sure Newegg is like worse off, huh? An RTX 2064, almost $800. I know that I have basically an unlimited budget right now, but even I'm not about that right now. GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition... Oh wait, is this is this fake? You will be receiving a digital print of an RTX 3080. I checked Newegg. There was nothing. I checked Amazon. There was nothing. I checked eBay. I have to start thinking about other weird, out of the box tactics. And I think I might have something. - So with all of my components added to my cart, right now on Newegg, which I have most of my components through, I've spent $439, with $7 promo code discount. On Amazon I'm looking at $110. And finally on eBay, I have $400 spent on my GPU. Giving me a grand total of about $940. It's not cheap, but I think the system is solid. I think I've got a good shot at beating Mr. Big Spender, Ken, over here. This episode of Broke Vs Pro is sponsored by Honey. Now with Honey, I can use the free browser extension to scour the internet for promo codes, I can see exactly what the historical prices are on a lot of items, and automatically save money as soon as I hit the checkout, if it does find any promo codes. That's especially important in an episode of Broke Vs Pro, where I want to build the most powerful gaming PC, at the lowest possible price. In two easy clicks you can install Honey in pretty much any browser you're using. And then when you go to checkout, on one of 30,000 supported sites, it will automatically pop up and say, hey, I've got some promo codes, do you want me to try them? And I will immediately say, yes. I like saving money, unlike Mr. Ken Bolido over here. Using honey is fast and free, so what are you waiting for? Head over to joinhoney.com/austinevans. Again, that is joinhoney.com/austinevans. And huge shout out to Honey for sponsoring this episode of Broke vs Pro. Welcome back to Broke vs Pro, where I have assembled my PC from a wide variety of very reasonably priced components. My grand total for all of this, was less than $1000. It was a little close to like $940 ish in change. You've got a really suspicious smile on your face right now. - [Ken] (laughing) - What do you? - [Ken] I may or may not have spent a lot of money for the pro set-up this time around. Just, yeah. - You didn't do a 3080, did you? You did not buy a 3080. How much is a 3080? Oh God. Oh God, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. How much did you spend? $2,300 for a sold RTX3080? What? Okay. Okay. Did you spend $2,300 on a GPU? - [Ken] Technically, no. - [Austin] So that looks reasonable. That looks like a reasonable. Okay. So, O11 Mini. Solid choice. - Yeah, this is one of my favorite cases to build in right now. - [Austin] That's actually not a crazy expensive chassis. I approve of an O11 Mini, that's very nice. - I got myself, of course, the best of the best, at least for what I needed. Ryzen 7 5800x. - [Austin] Ooh, very nice. I'm not as mad as I was a second ago. This seems like a very reasonable gaming PC build. I think you've actually done a good job here, going for a pro setup. Can I just point out you're missing GPU, and memory, and SSD. Wait, did you not? Did you forget? Where's your graphics card? Oh Jesus Christ. - I may, I may have made a little oopsie in using the credit card that Austin so kindly gave me a couple of years ago. - [Austin] Oh, what is that? I may or may not have accidentally bought a second computer. - [Austin] What? Wait, this is an Alienware? You bought an Alienware? - This was one of their Aurora prebuilts. - [Austin] Oh, wait, then, what, why? - Okay, okay, okay, okay, hear me out, hear me out. How much was the 3080 again? - [Austin] $2,300. - $2,300. You want to take a guess at how much I spent on this prebuilt? - $2,300? - $2600. Isn't this market weird? Isn't this market weird? - If $1000 is a broke setup to you, then a pro set up is probably gonna be like, three times as much anyway, Right? So I mean... - [Austin] Like, I know we did this for the best buy challenge, but like, that was a much smaller scale than an entire $2,500 Alienware or whatever, just to yank a GPU out. - Yeah. I mean like, I've pitched this idea numerous times, and I figured it was worth it for me to try it out myself. And I may or may not also want this computer at the end of the video, so I also - - [Austin] Wait, what? - Nothing! - [Austin] What? - Nothing! - [Austin] Wait, are you trying to steal company property, Ken? - I may or may not have, I may or may not have. No! - [Austin] Are you trying to steal? Is that what you're doing, you're stealing? - It's my build, Austin. - [Austin] What, that's not how this works! Whose name is on the credit card? - Actually, it's mine. (both laughing) - [Austin] That should be fixed! That will be fixed in short order, sir. - [Ken] I have never even heard of AeroCool. - AeroCool is the purveyor of many fine cases that are importantly cheap. Look at this high quality action with my plastic side panel, my magnetic dust filters. Oh boy. I've got a winner right here. - [Ken] This is like the PC case equivalent of watching paint dry. - So even though this is a brand I've never heard of, it is a 600 watt gold power supply. - [Ken] Wait, that 80 Plus logo looks so fake. - [Austin] That is not a... wait. Do we have like, an actual 80 Plus power supply somewhere? I'm totally gonna show them- - [Ken] Yeah, yeah, the one in my box, dude. - If you take a close look, this is an official 80 Plus rating, right? This is platinum, but this is the font, this is the design. Contrast that with this, the 80 Plus knock-off gold. I mean, realistically, it's probably fine, because most power supplies are only made by a couple of OEMs. And then it's just rebranded as like, EVGA, or whatever the case is. - [Ken] And most of our PC builds only need to work for a day. - That's a good point. As long as it works for long enough for me to win, then I don't care anymore. (chill upbeat music) - [Ken] How does this case? - [Austin] Yup? - [Ken] Not have a clean run for a 20 plus four? It's literally... - Uh, that's clean ish. I mean look, this is fine. It's not terri... (laughs nervously) It's okay, it's okay. I've got an idea. I can improve the cable management with this. Nothing like a broke setup, with some broke solutions. - [Ken] No, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, you are not. Oh Jesus. I can't believe you are actually just Sharpieing your mustard cables right now. - [Austin] Ooh, look at that. That's not bad. That's not bad. How have I never thought about this before? You don't know how proud I am right now of how big my brain is. I'm a genius. - All right. So this is the Alienware Aurora something, something, from Dell. (laughs) So to save a little bit of money, believe it or not, I did save some money on this build. I omitted the peripherals for this, so... - [Austin] Wait, that's an option? - Yeah. You can actually save $7 on the keyboard, and like $7 on the mouse, but they still give you all of the accessories with it, in this big top box. Check this out. (laughs) - And this is my power cable. - [Austin] It's environmentally friendly, Ken. - (laughing) That's so dumb. Look at that. Holy crap. This thing looks like a PS5. (both laughing) Look at that. It looks like a PS5. - [Austin] Oh, you're not even kidding, yeah yeah. - [Ken] If you're going for over the top gamer aesthetic, this is pretty much it. - [Austin] Okay. Ooh. That's dense. - That is very dense. I mean, this looks like, obviously a pre-built, but a little more complicated than some of the, you know, just normal chasses that you see coming out of Dell or HP. All right. So I'm just going to take the power supply out, because that'll at least get me access to the RAM. Ah-ha, Ah-ha. - [Austin] Oh, look at that. It's almost like it was designed like that! Wow. Ooh. You got some action going on in there! - [Ken] They actually give you an AIO. Nice. All right. HyperX Fury. 3,200 megahertz. Not bad. - [Austin] So I'm guessing you're stealing that? - I am definitely, definitely stealing that. Okay. Let's get this RTX card out. - [Austin] 3080, man. - 3080. There it is, in all of its chunky glory. Wow. That is probably the smallest 3080 that I've seen. Oh my God. Oh, here's our SSD, by the way. Oh, it's a Samsung 512 NVMe. - [Austin] Oh, Samsung. That's pretty good. - Yeah. All right. So, I got all my parts laid out. I just installed my power supply here, but now I'm ready to just drop in my Ryzen 7 5800X. And I'll also install my storage, and RAM from the Alienware, as well as the graphics card of course. (chill upbeat music) So about an hour later, I am a little further along than I was before. Had to do some slight adjustments. So, our AIO with our rad and our 140mm fans, $280 altogether. I think I could have probably had this as an intake, but I actually just wanted that to look nicer without the, whatever you call these things. What do you call this? - [Austin] I don't know, the back of the fan? - The back of the fan? Sure. It just looks better when you see all of the blades there, and the whole circular bit, so. The last thing that I have to do is put in our RTX 3080. I'm just going to literally slot this in. Of course, we're going to have to screw it in as well. I'm very, low-key happy, actually, that we got this out of an Alienware, because this is about as bare bones a card as you can get, obviously it's not a founder's edition, but it's not some stupid, over the top gamery graphics card card, that is super excessive. This is just very clean, very squared off actually, which matches our fans and everything else. I'm actually pretty happy with the aesthetics of this. - [Austin] Bro, it's just a bunch of fans with a PC in the middle. - I mean, isn't that really what all PCs are anyway? - [Austin] I guess. And so, it is time for the Broke vs Pro showdown! For the superior broke system, you can see my murder town 5,000 system. We've got a 980Ti, the finest graphics card from a few years ago, ahem. Ryzen 5 3600, 16 gigs of RAM, 500 gig SSD. I mean, look, this is a system which is, I would say, a solid, good mid range value. - I was kind of surprised about my own bill too, just as a refresher, so, I got the 3080 out of the Alienware, as well as my RAM, my SSD, and my hard drive. I got my NZXT AIO with the screen on it, showing my lovely VTuber Kentama, over there. For a pre-built, that was practically a steal. I am thoroughly happy with this system, at least for right now, I haven't gamed on it yet. Aesthetically, I am pretty happy. - [Austin] You know, for a system that costs, I don't know, $300 million or whatever, it looks nice. I also really appreciate the yellow cable extensions, that just looks sick. And I want to use that for more builds. Enough jibber jabber, enough yamber bamber, enough flapping your gums. Today, it's all about the performance. Let me show you my benchmarks scores though. I'm pretty impressed with what I was able to get, for less than a thousand dollars. There, look at that! 5,312 points in the 3D mark times by benchmark. That, my friends, is a whole lot of points for not a whole lotta dollar dollar bills. So this is I think, a good score for 2021 markup prices. So I'm happy with that. 5312, what you got? Probably a lot more than that. (laughing) - [Ken] 15,913. - Okay. So, you're three generations newer than me, and you have three times the gaming performance. - [Ken] Yeah, that 5800X is not joking around. - Look, I will concede this point. Now graphics benchmarks are all fine and good, but the real pros know that you need that CPU performance to push those high frame rate games. And here, I've got 1249 on single core, and 9,365 on multi-core. Beat that, Mr. Bolido! Okay. I guess you were able to beat that, weren't you? - [Ken] Yeah, just a little bit. - Okay. You might have the better PC, but is anyone surprised, when you spend the gross domestic product of Uruguay on your gaming PC? I don't think so. Instead, the real test is going to be, can I beat you in games? Because while I might not have your DLSS, and your ray tracing, and your RTX on, what I have is heart, skill, determination, and some selection of that actually is probably not true. I only have like maybe one of those things. Lets do it, shall we? - [Ken] What if I said I didn't care about the competition, and just wanted a new PC of my own? - What if I told you that the only way for you to take that PC home was if you win? - [Ken] I mean... - You're like, that was already a foregone conclusion. (both laughing) You're like, oh, oh no. Okay. Sure. - [Ken] What a scary challenge, ooh! I'm shaking in my boots, Austin Evans. - I'm not gonna talk anymore. I'm just gonna focus on beating you. - Sure. It's the one time in his life he actually focuses. - [Austin] All right, here we go. - [Ken] I don't know how to start an F1 car off the line proper. Like how much can I rev before I do that, that's exactly what was scared of. - [Austin] Woo-hoo-hoo!. - [Ken] All right. Well, so the problem here is that none of us can hear. - Yeah, I hear absolutely nothing right now. We should have headsets. - And usually for me I need to hear in order to shift gears, so this is actually fun, because I need to pay attention to my driving line more, but because I need to rely on the rumbling now, too. I don't know if my engine is actually just revving really high, which would help me figure out if I'm oversteering a lot, which means that, you know, I'll probably crash into a wall at some point. - All right. I'm feeling good right now. I'm not sure how far, I don't know where you are, but it's fine. - [Ken] Second and a half. - [Austin] You're a second and a half behind? - [Ken] Yep. - [Austin] Okay. I Can deal with that. All right, are you behind me right now? - [Ken] (shouting) - [Austin] Oh, did you crash? - [Ken] No, I spun out. Oh, yes! Accelerate! Who's scared? Go! - [Ken] Okay. Oh my God. What the? - [Austin] Ken, are you choking right now? - I am choking. - [Austin] So last time on Broke vs Pro, we were in a similar situation, and I maybe got a little bit too cocky. This time, I will do no victory donuts until the checkered flag has been crossed. - [Cameraman] You did like, five minutes of donuts! - No, I did not do five minutes of donuts last time! - You actually did, you actually did. - [Cameraman] It felt longer! - [Ken] Oh, I'm in the gravel! Okay, yeah, I'm writing this one off. - [Austin] You give up? - [Ken] Actually, I might as well just drive in the opposite direction and try to crash you. - [Austin] What? - [Ken] Let's go. - [Austin] What? This isn't NASCAR 2001, Ken! You can't go backwards. - [Ken] Oh! I'm disqualified from the session. - Wait, do I win? - I think so. - You were disqualified from the session! There we go. I am the winner of round one, through my superior gaming knowledge, and in no way up to Ken's incompetence, and driving backwards on a racetrack. How are you feeling, Mr I was disqualified from an F1 race? - I mean, the other two games are shooters, so I think I'm pretty okay. - Next up, we have Valorant. Now this is a game that Ken has a huge advantage in. How many hours of Valorant have you played? - Probably like, 100 over? - Over 100 hours? - Probably, if I had to guess? - I've got maybe two. Because we're playing on the same monitor, I don't like the fact that we're playing at 60 FPS. This feels bad. - [Ken] Yeah, I will agree with that 100%. - [Austin] I also don't love my mouse settings. I should have actually spent some time getting this set up. - [Ken] Ooh, let's go! - [Austin] Did you just get me? - [Ken] Yes, I just got you! That flake though! - [Austin] That was actually really smooth, man. Alright. Alright. Alright. We're good. We're good. We're good. - [Ken] Okay. One... - [Austin] No stress. - [Ken] (screams) Oh, that was Austin. - (oof) me in the face right there. - Pretty sure that's an offense. Three. - I mean, it's my fault. All right, I have dropped to three and seven. This is bad, and I feel bad. - [Ken] Oh, let's go. Okay. Well, I'm just wrecking right now. - [Austin] Nope. Nope, Nope, Nope. Nope. Go away. Go away. Go away. Go away. - [Ken] Hi Austin. Oh, geez. Try, try. Just try. - Oh, I almost got you! I almost got you! - [Ken] You had so much time to kill me, dude. - I did, I did, I had a lot of time. - [Ken] Sova? Oh, I wanted to kill the Sova. Oh, okay, I killed the Sova. (laughing) - [Austin] What's the final score? I think I was... - [Ken] I got 29 kills. - 29? I think I got 10. I was 12 and 22. (strained humming) So in a very un-Broke vs Pro move, we're going to be a team. - Very clearly, none of us have played this game all that much, because we are both level one. I think one of the reasons why I want to play Warzone is because of the graphics. Now obviously with Valorant being a super easy game to run, Warzone is a little tougher. - [Austin] Yeah. - By a lot. And I want to test not only how well we can play, but also how good our games look. - [Austin] Yeah. You're 150 FPS right now, I'm at 70. So I'm gonna drop it right in the middle of this garbage nest. - [Ken] It's scary that we can't hear anything again. I know you guys are- - How did I? I shot that dude like 10 times! - Where did you die? What, how did you, how? - I shot him 10 times! - [Ken] That's a car. Yo. Are they gonna? Oh, let's go! - [Austin] Are you? Wait, are you two? - [Ken] Oh Jesus. Oh, he's across from me. Oh, that's bad. Oh, he's going to get me. Oh he's going to get me. - [Austin] I'm coming but I'm like, really far away. - [Ken] Oh, he's really bad though. That took a while to, okay. I mean, I'm really bad too. Oh, we lost $10,000? We're in 8th place though. - Out of 10. (laughs) - We're not last. - [Austin] Hop on, hop on buddy. - [Ken] All right, oh oh. - [Austin] I got you, I got you. - [Ken] Okay, okay. - [Austin] Let's go, lets go. - [Ken] Okay. Let's go, lets go. Go go go. - Rollout! Autobots assemble! Whatever the (oof) you're supposed to say, I don't know. What's going on in here? - [Ken] I'm actually kind of scared. - [Austin] Oh, zombies! zombies, zombies, zombies, zombies. - [Ken] Are they over there? - [Austin] Yeah. And then we've got, there are enemies. Oh God, this is bad. Nope. Nope. Don't go in there. - [Ken] I killed the zombie, it's okay. Oh, look at this! Look at this! - [Cameraman] Can you really kill a zombie? - [Ken] With a gun, like I'm doing. - [Austin] Wow, I just got killed. How do you melee? Look at, (laughs). I'm just like, how I break a window, and this guy's like- - [Ken] This is embarrassing, dude! - [Austin] Okay, I'm coming back into that main building. - [Ken] Get, yes, let's go! Oh. - [Austin] Get him, get him! - [Ken] Nice. Nice. - [Austin] Nice. Nice. Nice. - [Ken] Come back, okay. - [Ken] Where are you at right now? Oh, I see. I'm actually coming in right behind you. - [Ken] Cool cool cool. Oh geez, oh. There's someone on the roof! - [Austin] Who, were? - [Ken] Across from us. Oh, I see him, I see him, oh, ready? - Oh Jesus, oh, he got me. Wait wait wait, can you heal me? - [Austin] Wait, yeah yeah, I'm right behind you. - Careful careful careful, okay. - [Austin] Gotcha. I gotcha. Teamwork makes the dream work, boy! - [Austin] I feel like we're not accomplishing anything. - [Ken] Yeah. We're so close. - [Austin] Oh, I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. Someone got me from up top. - [Ken] Up top? Oh, like above us? - [Austin] Yeah. I'm literally right beside you. I don't know where I got shot from, but I definitely got shot. - [Ken] Oh, airstrike. Oh, wait wait, I got to run. Hold up, come inside, come inside, come inside. - [Austin] Yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming. Nope, I'm dead. - [Ken] Okay. Nevermind. Oh no. - (laughing) I ran up, I'm just like, (shouting) All right, that was play of the game. - [Ken] I want to get up there and mess them up! - [Austin] Nah, they got us. They got us. - [Ken] It's okay. - [Austin] You know what, though? 2nd place. - [Ken] 2nd place! - [Austin] That's not bad! - I mean, we did none of the work. - We did literally none of the work, at all. - We literally did nothing. - I got like, $15 I found on the ground once. That was about it. Thank you very much for watching this episode of Broke vs Pro, make sure to subscribe and ring a ling that ding-a-ling bell.

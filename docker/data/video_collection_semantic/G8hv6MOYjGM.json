    "transcript": "- Hey guys. How's it going? it's Justine. And I am so excited because today in front of me, I have two of the new Nintendo Labo kits. A huge thank you to Nintendo or sponsoring this video, and supplying me with these kits. Because the day that this was announced, I was freaking out with excitement. It's basically just taking your Switch, and turning it into a completely different thing. Like this. A robot for instance. The Nintendo Switch is sold separately, but right now these are the two kits that are out. This is the Nintendo Labo Variety Kit, and this is the Nintendo Labo Robot Kit. So since I think the robot kit seems to be a little more advanced, I'm going to start out and learn the basics first. And we're going to unbox the the variety kit. Are you guys excited? Because I'm extremely excited. You can make, play, and discover. So we got various Toy-Con creations that you can make. There is the Toy-Con piano, Toy Con RC car. There's actually two RC cars, so if you have an extra set of Joy-Con controllers you and a friend can battle against each other. Toy-Con motorbike, Toy-Con house, Toy-Con fishing rod. So enough talking, let's open. (scrunching noise) (gasps) So first thing we have here is the software inside of here. Next up, we've got a bag of parts we need to assemble all of our Toy-Con creations. I think this might just be apart of the packaging. I don't think you build with this. Who's to say you can't use this to build something? I would say save it. Because later down the line, you guys are going to get crazy and wild. I know you're going to be taking every piece of cardboard that you get from anything, and making insane, crazy creations. So I look forward to seeing some of the great things that you guys make. Let's take out our cardboard. This is awesome because all the these have really cool printed things on them. So each one of these different colors will correspond with each Toy-Con kit that you're going to be making. I'm saving this box because I have a feeling that I'll be able to turn this box into something. Maybe a future robot. See, here is some of the accessory parts, and what's great s that a lot of these things are things that you can potentially have at your house already. So if there is something that you need to replace you easily find a rubber band, or a piece of string, foam sticker. And these are little reflective stickers. So what's really cool about these reflective stickers is in the right Joy-Con controller there is an IR motion camera. So with these reflective stickers in the IR that is what makes all of the magic happen. I think I'm going to start with RC cars because I think that is going to be the easiest one. Because there is only one sheet of cardboard. (playful music) I'm already so into this. I haven't even started doing anything yet. (playful music) What I love about this is you can actually zoom into your creations. You can go all the way around it, so if you're confused on just how something is put together there's no confusion, because you can zoom in to see exactly where things are placed. So here are the things that we can make here on the menu screen. I love that it gives you an estimation on how much time its going to take to make things. So the RC car- 10 minutes. I looks like the piano is the most difficult. It takes 150 to 210 minutes. Let's start with RC car. And here we go. (playful music rewinding) That's so cool. It just gave me a really quick fly through for everything that we're going to be doing. Two steps to complete. Take out these two parts. So this ones flashing, and this one. (box ruffling) It's cool because it gives you this tutorial. So there's a forward and a back button. I keep wanting to press down and click, but you actually just have to hold. So that fast forwards to the next piece of the directions. That's all we need for the RC car. (playful music) Wait, I did it. That's it. (box thumping) Oh, man. Guys, look here it is. Look how cute this is. It's a little cardboard antenna. It's like a little tiny hat or your switch. (giggles) So we got this first portion done. Now it's time to insert the Joy-Con controller. So here we align the plus and the minus, and slide it right in like so. It just got so much cooler. (gasps) Look at this. Wow. (blowing) And off we go. I just pushed a button and I wasn't even ready expecting this to happen. This is crazy. I'm going to start getting into spy stuff. Oh, yeah. My spying is going to go very well. You're never going to be able to hear me. There's two different modes right here. So when you click on the screen. I looks like heat map, but its actually a depth map. If it's red that means you're closer, and what cool using the distance you can use the auto drive feature. And you can lead it with your hand, just like so. Ah. (buzzing) As an added bones you can personalize any of the creations that you make. So I got some arts and craft supplies here. Let's decorate our little Toy-Con RC car. (upbeat xylophone) Now that I have everything all set up I'm going to take this off of the table, and on the floor so I can have plenty of room to play. This is so awesome. The fact that I'm controlling this from my Nintendo Switch using the vibration in these Joy-Con controllers is just beyond anything I can comprehend right now. There's also a two player versus mode. You ring this little bell. (dinging) Then if we had our second Toy-Con RC car and it ran into each other. Ah. The explosion. But if we were playing for real that definitely would not have happened to mine to my car. (upbeat music) Next up is the Toy-Con piano. I'm so excited, I had so much fun building the RC car. This one is going to be a little more complex, but I'm ready for the challenge. (rewinding music) (upbeat disco) You can use the on-screen touch controls to fast forward, but you can also use one of the Joy-Cons if that easier for you. Pulling the A button goes forwards, and the Y button goes backwards. There are three parts from sheet A and B. (bouncing bass music) Our Toy-Con piano is complete, and now for the last final touches. We put our Nintendo Switch right here into the front, and the Joy-Con into the back. (piano scale) I am a musical genius. (piano notes crashing) This is so shocking, because we started off with a flat piece of cardboard and now I'm playing the piano with a Nintendo Switch inserted into the front of this. (piano notes crashing) That's not even the best part, because we got these little knobs here. Each knob is inserted into the top, an as you can see this reflective tape is basically a code to tell the Nintendo Switch what sounds to play. Number one. (yelps) The whole screen just switched to cats. (meowing) What? (meowing) If you shake the piano slightly. (disturbed cats meowing) you can literally change the sound. And this little button you can press down. It will also give it another effect. (meowing) If you want to play a song, you can press this little play button right here. (bleep) (meowing) Number two. (choir singing) It's a choir. Are you ready for number three? I'm not sure if you are. (old man singing) It's grandpa. (old man groaning) This is insane because there are so many possibilities with this. You can even go as far as getting rhythm cards so you can punch out little pieces into the cardboard and insert it here. So its kind of like those old school pianos. If you guys have ever seen this, there's like this little scroll. It kind of scrolls and it automatically plays. So essentially its along those same lines, but different and way cooler. (old men groaning) Oh, grandpa feeling silly. (piano) (choir) (cmeowing) (bleep) I'm going to show you guys the inside of this thing. I know I mentioned the reflective tape, but this is how it actually works. So here is the controller that has the IR camera built into it. Now lets open this up. - [Justine] The first thing you'll see when I press the keys you hear the sound. (piano scale) You guys will also notice that there's reflective tape on each one of these keys. So the infrared sensor senses and reflects off of the tape. And that's how the sound is created. And that same thing happens whenever you put in the different knobs. The infrared reflect off of those reflective tapes. And it tells your Switch to change the sound. (meowing) So this last knob is a circle knob. This is called the special knob. When you insert this basically that activates this Joy-Con and it puts it in some sort of vibration mode, or acoustic mode. So each button corresponds with a different vibration frequency. (piano key) That's not sound coming from the Nintendo Switch. That is coming from this Joy-Con controller vibrating and the box is amplifying that. (piano buzzing) Well as much as I enjoyed racing cars and playing piano, My entire goal and dream in life, other than going to space, is to be a robot. (laser blasting) And its robot time. So to make the robot move you basically just lift your feet, and walk in place. (metal stomping) Here I am, tilting my head to give it directions, and punching buildings to destroy. (metal stomping) And if you want to go to first-person mode. Just like magic. Here we are inside of our robot. (metal crashing) Popping out of first-person mode, and now its time to fly. (blowing) Wow. I think I have my Halloween costume for this year. So when you bend your legs and you crotch down, you enter tank mode. (boxes crumbling) Stand back up, raise your arms and you're flying. (laser) Destroy everything. (metal stomping) (heroic music) This is definitely one of the more complex builds. This one takes around five hours, and there is so much going on inside of this backpack, that you guys can't even see right now. When I move my arms back and forth and my legs up and down you can see the reflective tape and the IR camera is picking that up. So that is how the movement is happening on screen. So inside of the Toy-Con hanger using these knobs you can change and customize your robot. Also what is really fun is you have two of these sets. Using one Switch consol you will be able to battle your robot friend. Thank you guys for watching. Hope you guys enjoyed this video. I had so much fun making these things, but there is still more to make, play, and discover in this variety kit. So with that I will see you guys in my next video. Bye. I'm a robot. (upbeat piano music)",

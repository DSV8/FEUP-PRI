    "transcript": "but what we're going to do today is to demonstrate to the viewers how things are using these radio signals to determine whether or not that you have something in your car that's worth breaking into and of course these Mac addresses that you see here are the way that you could connect to it but in this case the thieves aren't interested in connecting or hacking they just want to steal it and then of course they'll try to resell it this case it's a LE General discoverable mode all right with it gives us the devices uh Mac address and from the MAC address we can tell what company made it uh and often times you can see here it'll tell us the name and the company this is Dragon OS Dragon OS is a operating system designed specifically for SDR softwar defined radio so it's a way of hacking radio signals. I want to thank Brilliant for sponsor this video and putting together training like this that explains how Wi-Fi works so as an example many devices send messages wirelessly we've got Bluetooth we've got Wi-Fi and notice these are sent using electromagnetic waves so what's the difference between Wi-Fi and me speaking or as they've got here a foghorn when I speak and you hear me waves are sent through the air but that's different to electromagnetic waves notice a mobile phone Bluetooth speakers and handheld radio use electromagnetic waves but notice a fog horn doesn't it uses the air but how are digital signals transmitted through the air using Wi-Fi as an example notice we can transmit ones and zeros by switching between two amplitudes one representing zero and one representing one so as an example we could do that so how is a binary signal encoded here notice that hopefully is correct and this is what I like about brilliant it's a very interactive training here we told that a higher amplitude represents a one so the four sections of the wave represent 1 1 1 in binary so notice if you send a message what's actually happening is binary values digital values are transmitted through the air using Wi-Fi as an example and are decoded on the other side put into binary and then your message is displayed on your screen now you could also change the phase of the waves to represent different values so to summarize if we want to send binary through the air this is using amplitude this is using frequency and this is using phase to send binary values so that for example you can listen to music on a Bluetooth speaker or you can watch a YouTube video through Wi-Fi networks it's very important that you don't just learn how to hack networks but you also understand how networks work very interactive training explaining how networks work as an example in basic language with lots of explanations and lots of interactive quizzes that you need to complete.

OTW it's been too long great to have you back on the channel hey David it's always great to be on your channel the best IT and cyber security Channel on YouTube. Appreciate you saying that as always and I always say this one of the big reason reasons that it's you know as good as it is is because you are willing to share your knowledge with all of us just for everyone who hasn't seen our previous videos and you don't know OTW he's the author of this book Linux Basic for Hackers very very popular book on Amazon also wrote this book which I really like because I like networking so Network Basics for Hackers as well as Getting Started becoming aMaster Hacker so OTW really appreciate you sharing your knowledge for free with the community and I believe you've got a really interesting topic that we're going to talk about today just for everyone who's watching OTW and I really wanted to show Bluetooth hacking and jamming but neither of us want to go to jail so we can't do that but OTW hopefully you've got a topic somewhere something about that that right? Well yes one of the things that uh yeah neither wants to go out of prison um yeah so we're going to do something that's going to keep us out of keep us from going to prison but it's going to show some of the capabilities of IoT Bluetooth so the idea here is that you know one of of the things that we're doing at hackers arise is we're we're moving deeper and deeper into what are outside of traditional penetration testing we're working in uh radio hacking we're working in IoT Bluetooth there's all these devices that are connected by radio signals and one of those is Bluetooth yeah right Bluetooth is Bluetooth is ubiquitous it's all over the place it's we have types of Bluetooth we have the traditional or the classic Bluetooth and we have the Bluetooth low energy and more more and more of our devices have Bluetooth low energy just because they're portable devices and we want to spare the amount of power that they consume and one of the things that one of my listeners readers brought to me recently was an article that appeared uh on the news that was uh about some thieves I guess they were in San Francisco I believe and they sent me they sent me this article and it says Tech- saavy thieves use Bluetooth to decide which cars are worth breaking into so yeah so they're they're stealing Bluetooth devices and they're deciding which ones have devices in them that would make it worth breaking in h by scanning for Bluetooth and so this particular person who sent me this article said how do they do this I don't really understand so I said okay well let's let's go through that process and I'll show you what can be done and this is you know one of the lesser known areas of radio hacking penetration testing hacking what have you is Bluetooth and some of these radio signals that all around us I think you and I have done a couple of you've done some you've done a number of videos on the Flipper Zero and one of the beauty of the Flipper zero is it's made everybody aware of all these radio signals around us that are controlling so many devices and so the flipper zero has some limitations and you know we've talked about that but it's it's really open people's eyes so this is one of the areas that I'm most enthusiastic about in terms of cutting edge uh hacking penetration testing cyber security is the radio signals that are all around us whether it be Bluetooth or wifi or satellites cell phones you name it this they're all giving off radio the they're receiving and sending radio signals that are often times very vulnerable easily vulnerable that's what the flipper zero showed us is how easily some of them are vulnerable to attacks one of those attacks is jamming signals right so you know it's kind of like jamming radio sign signals in some ways it's like a DOS attack or a DDoS attack you know is that if you can stop the signal from being sent or received then you've you know you've you've essentially hacked the signal right so for instance if somebody is in in a communication using radios say cyber warfare environment where you know one Army one one division of the Army is communicating with the other division of the army and they're set they're communicating about what they're moves out it might be hard okay it might be hard to decrypt the communication assuming it's encrypted but if you can block it right then you've basically served the purpose is if for instance we have a lot of security systems a lot of security systems use radio signals to communicate right so for instance the alarm systems that will sometimes use Bluetooth or other radio signals sometimes Wi-Fi to be able to communicate and if those can be blocked or jammed then the security system doesn't work and these are relatively easy to do but we can't really show them on YouTube because of legal concerns the legal concerns that neither one of us wants to violate all right so but what we're going to do today is to demonstrate to the viewers how thieves are using these radio signals to determine whether or not you have something in your car that's worth breaking into for right so if you have a a laptop whether or not you have a phone whether or not you have a tablet you know these are the devices that the thieves are looking for because they're they're valuable right we all know how much we spend on these things and so the thieves are using a little bit not terribly sophisticated but a little bit of sophisticated technology to determine which cars are worth breaking into so just kind of keep it you know let let you know what's going on in the world for those people who are into security this is something that you should be aware of that these devices are giving off a signal and they're telling the thieves who they are and what they are and this is a way that they can determine you know whether or not they want to break into that vehicle so we're going to talk about Bluetooth scanning so just looking at just scanning the environment and seeing what Bluetooth devices are out there. One of my team attended one of your courses recently and it was interesting she said that and again we have to be careful what we say on YouTube but there were some really interesting people in your course from I I'll just use this as the YouTube analogy three-letter agencies right so there's a lot of government people perhaps or police that are interested in this stuff because of all the problems I take it. We have we have a number of law enforcement who come into our class and she was a welcome addition to our class we were really happy to have her there and she added a lot to our class but yes we do have that's great a number of agencies European and the US who come in and take our classes to learn how a hacker would approach things and then of course how it can be defended yes so we're we teach both sides of the equation we're we're teaching both the offensive and the defensive side of cyber security in any case what we wanted we're going to do today is kind of show show everybody how the thieves are identifying the vehicles that have something valuable in them that is makes it worth them breaking in so this is for those people who are in law enforcement this is a way that that this is how it's taking place this is how simple it is to find whether or not a vehicle has a Bluetooth enabl device in it that's what we're going to be doing here today so since most of viewers are using Kali we'll we'll start there and then we'll look at some other ways of doing this of course you know there's a number of of phone and tablet apps that can do something very similar to what we're going be doing here today but let's start by using Kali so one one of the things with Kali is that it doesn't by natively have tools for Bluetooth in it all right so one of the things you're going to need to do to do any kind of Bluetooth hacking or Bluetooth scanning is go ahead and just go sudo apt and then uh install of course and then there's a a set of libraries called bluez right that you need and we've done a little bit of of Bluetooth in the past here yeah. Just for everyone who's watching we did a video which was great to see where we attacked a phone just by using Bluetooth and I'll link that below yeah we also did some Bluetooth in uh one of the Mr Robot yes where uh he used a device to be able to connect to the policeman's uh laptop his Bluetooth adapter and this kind of brings me to one of the important things I want to point out is that I think Bluetooth is really underappreciated in terms of being a vector to getting inside of the phone or other device right you people have kind of gone to sleep on Bluetooth and there's a lot of vulnerabilities in Bluetooth and Bluetooth low energy that can be used to get into the system so what we're going to be doing today is we're going to be doing some simple uh scanning just be kind of like maybe like doing an NMAP scan in the on a TCPIP network that's similar we trying to discover what devices are on the network you know what ports are open that's what we're going to be doing okay now we've got blue this is a set of libraries that handle Bluetooth and one of the things that you want to do is you got to First of off if you're using Kali in a a Virtual Machine like I am I'm using it in Oracle virtual box so it's a free VM easy to work with sometimes it doesn't work quite as well as uh VMwares virtual workstation yeah workstation thank you it's free now which right can use right so workstation Pro is not free y right workstation workstation uh is free and it's a it's a great piece of software I'm using this one here I'm using this is Oracles it's also free so what we're going to be doing here then is first of all we've got to go ahead and generally if you're using it as a a virtual machine you're going to need to attach a Bluetooth adapter so we're going to go up here and look at what devices we have and I've got one here and it's designated by the chipset design Cambridge silicon radio chip in it and this one is compatible with Linux not all of them are but most of them are compatible with Linux and so what we're going to do is we're going to look at a few key commands in Bluetooth to be able to function in Bluetooth in general most people you know in Bluetooth are simply you know tearing devices you know turn on the Bluetooth and Discover Mode you pair the devices and you can listen to your music or whatever you're doing but from a cyber security perspective we need to have more capability than that and this is usually outside the realm of most people's skill set because they're used to working with the old TCPIP so what the first thing we need to do is that we have an adapter that's now enabled and so we can go lsusb to make sure that it's actually connected and there it is right there so this is list USB and then we've put in the whole Library of Bluetooth tools with the blue EZ and so then what we want to do is go HCI config right and you can see that I've got HCI is a designation for Bluetooth right tells me the bus is USB gives me the address so here you can see it's it's up and running often times when you first put in the device it's going to be down and what you need to do is to take it back take it up so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this one down and then bring it back up to show you what you need to do so it's going to be pseudo HCI config all right and then the device name HCI zero and yours may be HCI 1 usually it's going to be HCI zero and we're going to say down taking it down this is going to disconnect it and then we can just go HCI config and you'll see that this is normally what's it's going to look like when you first install stall your adapter then we're going to take it up and that means it's going to be running right now we've got some some tools that are built in here for specifically for Bluetooth and one of them is going to be HCI tools so we'll go HC pseudo HCI tools and then let's just do an h and see what it can do right and I spelled it wrong it has no s at the end of it there we go WR chat all right so here we go this is HCI tool version 5.71 and if you have to designate the the device you can do it right there you have a display the local devices is Dev in inquiry scan name info okay and then you go through and you can see the create a connection disconnect and a number of others all right so we're just touch scratching the surface of what these tools can do in Bluetooth now this is part of what we'll be doing in our upcoming Bluetooth hacking class but it's right now we're trying to say how do those thieves know that there's a Bluetooth device in that car exactly and there's a simple way of doing that using this tool we can simply go Pudo HCI tool and then sometimes you're going to if you have more than one Bluetooth adapter you might have to designate okay which adapter you're using like that right but we only have one so we don't have to do that but and then we're just going to ask it to go ahead and scale this is this is what the thieves are doing is they're simply going out and scanning and seeing which Bluetooth devices respond on a scan very much like an NMAP scan and it'll tell us not only only which ones are there but also tell us who the manufacturer and give us a lot of information about those particular so let's just do that let's go do a scan and let's hit enter and I once again I got the s in there again right and let's go like that and scanning so this is what the thieves are doing they're going along and just scanning and seeing which bluetooth enabled devices are are going to respond to them oh got one came up got two of them this one came up without a name attached to it that's kind of interesting and this one came up it says it's a a Galaxy Note 10 this might be worth breaking into for the thieves right let's try running it again and see if we can get the name coming off this one usually we can get more information let's try it again like all tools they don't work perfectly all the time oh we got some new ones this time we've got uh looks like a son p and an edifier all right so we could you know obviously just look up this model to see whether or not this is what the thieves would do I I look up this model oh is this something you know with a phone in hand or whatever is this something that we want to is it worth breaking in for and of course these Mac addresses that you see here are the way that you could connect to but in this case the thieves aren't interested in connecting or hacking they just want to steal it and then of course they'll try to resell it so odw can you do you have a picture of that device or if we just search for that chipset um we'll we'll be able to find the specific device you're using all right here it is so this one's made by Panda you see it's a Bluetooth 4 there's actually up to Bluetooth 5 right now so uh this is an older one but it works great one of the things that you'll find at some of the new adapters is that Bluetooth is designed to be for a Pico net a very small Network p meaning very small and so it's the devices are specified that they must be able to extend to about 10 meters right so it's it has a minimum of 10 Metter 10 met so you know that's that's pretty small network but many of the devices can reach up to up to 100 meters which is a pretty good distance right and so this one right here that I'm using will reach about 10 meters and that's not going to go much beyond that but if you have some of the newer devices you can reach out to 100 meters and sometimes if you use an antenna in an amplifier you know one of the one of the beauties of doing this with say a hack RF which we're going to do next is that you can use an amplifier and an antenna on it and reach much greater distance so the really sophisticated thieves are using a hack RF or other software defined radio to be able to reach out you say to an entire parking lot rather than having to walk right alongside the vehicle and scan you might be able to go to a large parking lot or a parking garage right where there's thousands of cars and then just scan the whole parking lot to find devices within that U parking lot parking garage right so this is the this is the simplest way of doing it is simply put plug in one of these and then you know move around or if you what we're going to do next is we're going to use an antenna with the hack RF to do exactly the same thing so we know that right in this immediate vicinity we have two Bluetooth or may three we we got this one up here we got our Galaxy Note here it didn't come up the next time so This Is Not Unusual that the Bluetooth there sometimes it'll pick it up and sometimes it won't dependent upon it there's anything blocking it and I guess it's important to say now that if you don't want your Bluetooth enabled devices to be stolen the the key is to turn them off right if you probably the most important thing is don't even leave them in your car right but I haven't seen anybody using this for you know breaking into houses but we do see it being used as a way to breaking into cars so you know if you don't want those devices to be stolen turn them off because as long as there's power to these devices right they're going to be sending out a beacon that the attackers can see that's what we've done here we've gone ahead and seen a couple of these devices um this one I think is a TV set here this one is a speaker system this one is a phone now so this is the simplest way using Kali we also have and we've done this in other other videos as we used a a new operating system relatively new called Dragon Os from a security point of view cber security point of view it's a good idea to turn Bluetooth off but also from this point of view right another reason to turn it off right so from a cyber security perspective it's possible that your Bluetooth adapter can be used as a vector as a way of getting into your device your phone you know our phones are probably the greatest repositories of information about our us and Our Lives of anything you you could you could you know people can get your pii your person identifiable information maybe your your usernames and passwords and what have you off you know some of these data dumps that are on the dark web but the phone is where everything about you resides right so all the personal stuff that's in there including possibly your banking text messages your emails you know everything that you're doing in your life because our phone is like you know is an appendage of our of the human being at this point so and almost every I think I think probably can say every phone has a Bluetooth ad doct and and the nightmares when you turn them off like on Apple they turn it on the next day unless you explicitly disable it right so if you just swipe down and disable it it'll re reenable it which is a nightmare right go on right exactly so if you don't if from cyber security perspective you want to make sure that that Bluetooth adapter is not enabled okay because it can be used now you know one of the things one of the one of the uh strengths okay or from the attacker perspective is the attacker has to be close to you this is a Pico net right so you're not going to get you know a Nigerian hacker or scammer you know or a Russian hacker or Chinese hacker getting into through your Bluetooth it's it's a local attack it's going to be probably within 100 m it's somewhere in that area so you need to make sure that the Bluetooth is turned off or disabled to keep from somebody getting inside your phone now we're talking about these thieves who are breaking into cars it's important that you power the phone off right or the tablet or the laptop or whatever it is you either take it with you or power it up because otherwise it's sending out a signal that can be seen by the attackers and once they see it then they know that that device is inside that vehicle they break in grab it and your life is turned upside down so it was they've got this big problem in London just to Sidetrack for a second where phones are getting snatched like crazy so you're just walking along cuz people are not oblivious they walking along and then a guy on a bicycle as as an example rise pass and grabs it out of your hand and rides off with it and though in this documentary they were saying a lot of phones end up in China like a few days later and um it's um it's a huge problem here in the UK with phones being snatched um that's your problem your life your whole life's on that phone right so your whole life's on their phone yeah and so that's why this is becomes really important to think about the cyber security or just the security of your phone is that once your phone is gone then you know everything is gone not only does the attacker all all the information about you but also that you have to you know reconnect to all the people that you're connected with and all the other devices you're connected with and all the services that you're connected with so it becomes quite a nightmare so yeah this we we talking about security and physical security and cyber security for these devices and what we're focusing on is that that Bluetooth is basically giving it away as to where your device is all right so let's uh let's talk about another way that the thieves can find your devices this is one a little more powerful a little more sophisticated and that we're going to be using um this is Dragon OS Dragon OS is a operating system designed specifically for SDR softwar defined radio so it's a way of packing radio signals and we we use it for a lot of our classes we use it for our Bluetooth class or iot class coming up our satellite class coming up we use it for all of those um classes so let's go ahead and open up a terminal in it and uh there's also if you haven't seen it before there's a number of tools that are built into it you can see there's a lot of tools built in here this is the other section it's not under it's not under ham radio so some of some of the tools I just don't understand how one decides which tools go where but and some of the tools don't even have links so that's one of things you got to get used to with it but under ham radio it has a bunch of tools right under other has a bunch of tools and some of them don't even have links on the menu system so one of the things that one of the interesting tools that it does have is a tool called Mirage and Mirage was developed by uh a couple of French researchers for doing iot H right so let's take a look at it so user source and then the Mirage and then we and then we just go on ls- L and you can see that there's a mirage launcher right so we can just go ahead and go sudo right Mirage laer and this basically just starts the interactive shell so it's just a way to be able to connect to Mirage and the tools that it has and the developers have said that they were trying to put together a tool for iot hacking that had a kind of look and feel of metas sploit so most of you have seen Metasploit I'm not sure how successful they were and given the same look and feel as Metasploit but that was their goal and you can you can decide whether or not it has the same look and feel Metasploit has become the the standard looking feel for cyber security tools and my password in there and let's see if we can get Mirage and going if I put my password in correctly there it is Mirage so let's the first thing we to do with Mirage is just go list and oh we could do a help but here's here's the modules right so here's a the Bluetooth modules in here these are the Bluetooth low energy and so let's talk about about this difference between Bluetooth and Bluetooth low energy Bluetooth classic has been around for almost like 30 years now and it uses a fair amount of energy so you'll see Bluetooth classic being used in devices that like your speakers that are in your home or your TV set what have you where the amount of energy that they use is not that critical but on mobile devices Bluetooth low energy is often times you'll see both of them devices but the future belongs to Bluetooth low energy I think we can say that they don't really share much except they work on the same frequencies right so basically both of them are working at 2.4 gigahertz area they use different channels right but still under 2.4 gigahertz and often times we can find an awful lot more devices by scanning for Bluetooth low energy so oftentimes your phone will have classic Bluetooth and I'll have Bluetooth low energy and a number of other devices as well so you can see that there's a a Bluetooth Jam right here we don't want to get in trouble right um J jamming is illegal in almost every country of the world okay jamming is illegal in almost every country of the world now it's interesting that you can buy Jammers in the US and as you can you they're for sale openly for sale the US let me show you right now the the law says that you can't use them and here's a couple of sites that U that specialize in cell phone Jammers let's go find one of them here I'll show you what they have for sale there a store called the Jammer store this is a company that just sells Jammers and this is $99,500 so it's a significant amount of money 200 Watts okay here they have some Against drones some against uh GSM 3G 4G 4G yaax wifi so there's a these are for sale you can buy them and my contacts in law enforcement have told me that generally nobody enforces the law unless you use it so it's okay to sell it and it's okay to buy it but you can't turn it on as long as you don't as long as you don't turn it on you're safe so these are and there's the cheaper ones than this this is a very 200 watts is a significant power you can buy cheaper ones for you know a few hundred a few thousand but in any case this is uh illegal in almost every country in the world any case so we have the capability of doing a ble Jam uh it takes a special adapter to do a b jam and you can see some of the other things and there's also so some simple uh Bluetooth modules ESB modules uh Mouse visualizer uh infrared Mozart WiFi and zigby module so this is one of the tools that we'll be using in our iot hacking class and our Bluetooth hacking class we have iot I think in October and Bluetooth in January so the thieves that we're talking about right the more sophisticated ones would be using something like let's go up here and see Bluetooth they're not very sophisticated they're just a little more sophisticated than the street thieves right there's a module called ble scan right this is a scans module for Bluetooth low energy devices the beauty of this is that you can attach it to an antenna a amplifier and the hack RF to scan wide range for of Bluetooth device so what we're going to do is we're going to load that module okay go BL e okay scan okay this just going to tells me that it's loaded up the blle scan module the next step is to look what the arguments are ARs and you can see the arguments are you know the amount of time the address name these are the fields that it's going to display um and we don't need to put in a Target but we do need to tell it what device we want to use now if you've got a Bluetooth adapter you know the HCI can work in this case we want to use an SDR device because it gives us greater capabilities the Bluetooth adapter is going to be is going to show us what's available in a near field right the Pico field but by attaching it to a hack RF we can scan a much broader range we can also attach an antenna an amplifier as I said earlier and then yeah be able to find Bluetooth device is in a much broader area so let's do that let's make sure that our hack RF is connected here let's go um and take this down and then go USB and there's our great Scott Gadget hack RF right now not all of these modules will work with the hack RF but the Bluetooth would the Bluetooth low energy so we can go set the interface right to hack ourf like that so all we're doing is we're saying rather than using the Bluetooth the HCI Z we want to use the hack Arrow now we can go just look at the args again and you see that it's set up to use the hack RF when I've got the hack RF all set up it should work we'll keep our fingers crossed and then all we need to do is say run right and look at it connected to the hacker oh I found found one device let's give it a little time see if it finds more so let's go and try again we found one device right let's try running it again ah we got one that's all we got all right so in this case we're only going to looks like we're only going to get this one Bluetooth low energy device the Bluetooth low energy you're going to usually find in a highly populated are you're going to find tens maybe you know maybe hundred of them because so many divices are now running Bluetooth low energy and they basically a Bluetooth low energy devices go to sleep and so they don't use they use very little energy until somebody sends out an inquiry like we've been doing here and then they wake up and they send back this information telling us who they are in this case it's a Le General discoverable mode all right with it gives us the devices uh Mac address and from the MAC address we can tell what company made it uh and often times you can see here it'll tell us the name and the company if you if you got a moment I can pull up the output from from last week's class you want to do that yeah let me just let me do this so we can use that we first of all we load the ble scan and then we set the interface to hack R and then we simply run now as you can see on the screen it's picking up multiple devices in my area it's giving me the MAC address the name of the device the company which is for the thieves this is going to be the critical part right they want to see what the device's name is in the company you see there's a couple of apples up there this is going to be intrig intriguing to the to the uh the thieves and then based upon that information they can decide they have been deciding whether or not they want to hack break into those they don't hacking they're breaking into the vehicles and stealing devices that are their so this is where that that Beacon that's being sent out by your Bluetooth becomes a a signal to the thieves that your device is in there and it's a valuable device making it worth breaking into your vehicle to to get those are two ways those are two ways that the thieves can find your vehicle you find the devices what vehicles have the devices in it the simplest one is simply using a Bluetooth adapter and that's going to have to be close to the device you know usually like alongside the car or the home by using a hack RF and an antenna you can pick up from a much longer range and the thieves don't have to be right alongside your vehicle to pick up that signal from your Bluetooth device odw V one question I think some people might have is okay let's say I run this and there's 10 cars in front of me which one's window do I break not that I'll ever do that but you know these well what you can do okay first of all if you're using the the the low power one the one that's we Us in K that's only going to work in a very short distance so it's you're going to have to be the th will have to be a long longside it now if you using the hack RF what you can do is use a directional they can use a directional antenna all right and be able to determine whether or not which device is in which vehicle because you're going to say like a yagi antenna right you know the yagi antenna that you know many people have used for wi-fi hacking it's a directional antenna uh and that yagi antenna will be very specific to the vehicle so the thieves can determine what's inside that vehicle by simply pointing the antenna to that particular vehicle I'm glad you said that and I mean I just for everyone who's watching and um obviously for the YouTube regulations I've never broken into a car and I never planed to do this this is just showing you the problems that uh that it's a real problem right this is I seen videos of San Francisco it seems like the cars are getting broken into all the time it's a massive problem it seems in the US um and in the UK phone snatching is a massive problem so you know it's good that you highlight OTW ways that we can you know stop this kind of nonsense or better protect ourselves and it's just important to remember to turn off Bluetooth for cyber security reasons but also for you know protecting your personal property and as always don't leave stuff in your car exactly yeah don't leave stuff in your car and if you do make sure that that blue to signal isn't going out so turn them off is you're going to keep them in your vehicle turn off the the phone turn off the laptop turn off the tablet because if they're on they are sending out a signal that the thieves can pick up and know that there's a valuable device somewhere in that vehicle it's interesting what you said about houses because I saw some I mean I don't want to get into the politics but I saw like in Canada there's been complaints that the police have said you you should leave your car keys your car outside so they don't break into your house and hurt you to prevent the possibility of being attacked in your home leave your fobs at your front door but it seems like this could also be used you know to discover devices in the in your house perhaps and then decide which house to break into yes it it certainly is true because you know you can scan the house the houses in a neighborhood and determine which one of them have valuable uh devices but I think that in breaking into a house usually there's more value lable things than simply a phone and so that the phone might be a secondary Target versus other things that might be in the house that the thieves are looking for so that's probably why we're not seeing this used primarily in in breaking into houses but into cars you know where you the pro the most valuable thing inside the car might be the phone or the laptop ogw again I really want to thank you for sharing your knowledge and just for everyone who's watching I've put a link to otw's website below OTW thanks so much you run a special right so if someone uses my special code they get a discount correct yes we have the 20% off with the bomble b m b 20% off anything in our online store and I really appreciate you sharing this for free just for everyone who's watching again we can't put stuff on YouTube that we really want to share but OTW can show you more stuff in his courses so if you want to join three letter agencies who attend these courses or you know security people that join the course and learn both Blue Team and Red Team are I'll put that link below OTW I I like our discussions where you balance offensive security but you also look at defense and that's what you teaching your classes right right we try to we try to teach both offense and defense and and for the people who are primarily on the defensive side who are protecting the corporate assets I think it's really important that they understand how the hackers attackers are getting in you can better defend the more you know about the techniques of the hackers attackers again for everyone who's watching put comments below stuff that you'd like us to cover OTW has a huge amount of knowledge you were teaching my team about I think it was Cyber Law and I mean your knowledge stretches way across a whole bit different or whole range of realmed so um please put your comments below stuff that you'd like me to ask OTW and you know the kind of videos you'd like to see I know a lot of you have been commenting and asking for him to come back so again let us know the comments sorry the uh the topics that you want to see OTW thanks as all thank you David it's always great being on your show",

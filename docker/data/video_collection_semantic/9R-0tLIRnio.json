    "transcript": "- So I just bought a $250 mouse made of brass and leather. Oh wait, sorry. Pointer Instrument. Well, let's see how well this works out. Sponsored by Linode. (bright upbeat music) Hey guys, how are you all doing? If you're new here, welcome. My name is Krazy Ken and this is the Pointer Instrument by Lunar Artefacts. I saw an ad for this on Facebook and I just had to test it out because I thought it would be hilarious for this show. Now I've never heard of these guys before and I'm willing to bet most of you haven't either. So here's a little bit I know about them. Lunar Artefacts is a design studio in London. And they seem rather new, I can't recall hearing of them until about a week ago. Their Twitter was created in March 2021. So as of today, only about 14 months ago and judging by the photos on their website, they take design and craftsmanship very seriously and they have a touch of a luxurious feel along with that too but also to quote their website, they focus on infinite repairability. And it appears their pointer instruments are easy to open and none of the components, or at least the major components are soldered down so you can fix it and expand the life of it. And we'll take a look at the insides later too. And I was curious about their backstory so I clicked on the video on their website but it's like literally just B-roll. There's no music or dialogue or anything. I don't know if that was on purpose so we'll just fill in the rest with our imagination. But anyway, everything sounds good to me. Let's unbox it and take it for a test spin. So I'm gonna try to open it up just with my fingernails as to not damage the important packaging. All right, as my friend, Alfred Diblasi would say, the condom unit has been removed. Here is the packaging with the specs on the back. Genuine full grain calf leather, might go really nice with my 20th anniversary Macintosh peripherals. Solid bras or aluminum base. It's a game they like to play, it's brass or aluminum, open it up and find out. All jokes aside, you can buy an aluminum one if you want but hey, we're going all out here, we're getting the brass. You can do wireless charging, okay, pretty nice. And printed with soy ink which makes it taste better or something. Okay, let's pop it open and we have successfully opened it upside down. There we go. And now we open up the monolith, here we go. There it is. Ooh, hey, okay. That's a quilted padded finish, I'm not sure what this is really called but you know what I'm trying to get at. It's something you'd probably see in like a fancy bedroom, I don't know how else to describe that. I'm not rich enough to know what it's called. And ooh, it's in the, ooh, hang on. That's got some weight to it, okay. I see you. And then the Pointer Instrument user guide and then a braided USB-A to USB-C cable for charging. I would like to test the wireless charging though too, that sounds pretty nifty. You don't get that luxury with an Apple Mouse. We'll take it out for the first time. Ooh, oh, hello. That is actually kinda pretty, holy cow. That leather looks really good. That brass is really shiny. That is really, really reflective and beautiful. That leather feels good too. Oh, very nice. I'm guessing this is some sort of like cushion to protect it. There we go, kinda looks like Batman. It does, look, he's got like the cow with the like the ears and like the wings. This is a Batman, they just won't admit it. Even like the fricking scroll wheel is brass. Like, yeah, that's not just like a plastic finish that looks glossy like it's got some nice thickness and weight to it. We'll test it with a computer but first let's just test the ergonomics here. Does feel a little different than when I'm used to with the Magic Mouse but that's bound to happen with any mouse. It's a nice click. It feels like the click is a little heavier than the Magic Mouse, just a bit. But it does feel nice with the leather. Personally, not a huge fan of scroll wheels. I prefer the Magic Mouse is touch surface 'cause you can scroll in any direction on that but it would be pretty hard to do a multi-touch surface on leather so we can make an exception. Oh, there's actually some more packaging on the bottom here to remove this little label here and the tab is stuck. Oh, it's like stuck in the USB-C port. I can't get the tag out. Okay, we'll just have to peel it from the other side. There we go. That center click almost feels heavier than the rest of the buttons. Like these click pretty easily. You need a lot more force to do a center click on the wheel. Interesting. I think the thing that's tripping me up is like this wider part here 'cause this narrow part here is kind of the width I'm used to for a mouse but then all of a sudden it's like (weird mouth noise)! It gets wider out here. And I think that's what's kind of tripping my hand up. Hopefully I get used to it. All right, so I busted out the handy dandy iFixit Toolkit and we will take a look at the inside of this boy, assuming it's a boy. How do you tell? Anyway, I guess you just pop the top off. Okay, fine. I'll read the instructions, guy. Pull down from the upper edge. Okay, that's what I was doing. All right, I just wanna make sure I don't break anything. I mean, I can't return it anyway. The return policy is if you open it, you're screwed. Which whatever, I mean, fancy stuff. Okay, wow, ooh, hello. That actually looks kinda cool. It's like a Darth Vader style black plastic with this gold around it. Okay, I dig it. Even the screws are brass colored, pretty sweet. Okay, I just need a hex key here, it's really small and I'm guessing it just kinda, oh, okay. The screws do fall out. I thought they were staying in there, apparently not. Pull this guy out, there we go. Okay, there's our rechargeable, looks like a 850 mAh battery. One, two, three, pull. Oh (beep), there's the inside. Here's the bottom assembly and the brass shell. Yeah. That's a nice solid piece of brass there. That is shiny. I probably like the bras more than the leather. I mean, the leather is still really fricking cool but man, this brass is really sweet. I'm not a repair expert but doesn't look too insanely complicated. The cool thing is they actually do have a lifetime repair program as well. And when I was dissembling, the main board, this little board fell off and I didn't really pay attention to what it was until I flipped it over. That is the coil for the wireless charging. It'll be fun to test it with like an Apple MagSafe charger, I think that'll be great. Let's get it all assembled back together and then we'll test it on a computer. Ooh, that's magnetic. Ooh, so fancy. I just love the satisfaction of magnets aligning pieces. There we go. That feels good to me. It's back in order. Woo, victory spin. Let's do the wireless test first for the charging and then we'll connect it to a computer. So on the bottom we do have the DPI sensor adjustment and we also have the mode switcher. You can use it with the dongle. You can use it just with regular Bluetooth that's in your computer or you can use cable mode. You can use the USB C port on the front so when you're charging the mouse with the cable, you can still use it with your computer unlike with a certain fruit flavored mouse. And of course the wireless charging which we will test in a sec. So let's go ahead and turn it on. Ooh, pretty lights. Let's go ahead and bust open system preferences and there's Lunar Mouse. All right, connect and connected. And there it is, worked on the first freaking try, look at that. Dragging a window around, right click. Okay, well that was a piece of cake. Let's see if we put it on the charger if it will show a little battery charging icon. I have my MagSafe Duo here. Whoa, okay, the mouse cursor is absolutely freaking out. Oh my gosh, this is so weird. What the hell? Okay, I can't explain that one. That was the weirdest, well I've seen weirder but that was one of the weirdest things I've ever seen on a computer. Let's try to troubleshoot this together. Let's try turning it off. I can hear it. I can hear some sort of little electrical charge going through it. So it sounds like it's doing something when it's on the Qi surface. Let's turn it back on. Nope, there goes them cursor again. Is like the wireless charging causing some sort of Bluetooth interference? Well, let's just put it into cable mode and charge it. There's a little pulsating light right there underneath. So it does look like it's charging. I'm gonna investigate this. To test it, I took some gaffer tape, put it over the sensor, turned the device on, put it in Bluetooth mode so it is connected to the computer again but then I put it back on the Qi charger. Now the cursor isn't jumping around like crazy because I blocked the sensor. So something from this particular charging surface is beaming into the sensor and it is making it go crazy. I should probably test it with another Qi charger. The only other practical one I have is the one I built into my lamp. Okay, so I tested the wireless charging with my lamp in my office, it actually has a Qi charger built in. I put it on, it was still connected to the computer, the cursor didn't freak out. So I think it'll work on normal Qi chargers. The one big difference Apple does with their MagSafe is it has a magnet in it. So when you attach your phone, it aligns and stays on like that. And I'm not a magnet expert but I'm willing to bet that magnet is what's causing the problem with the mouse cursor jumping around. So problem mostly solved, hopefully. You know, another nice perk about the design here with the stitched leather, it really matches the old Mac OS with that skeuomorphic design. So feel free to use this with that. And your hardware will like quite literally match the software, aesthetic. Okay, so I've been testing it out for a bit and I have concluded the two things I don't really like about this product. I'll start with the good stuff first. It is really pretty, even the inside is really attractive and the way it's easy to open up and repair is a pretty nice perk especially if you're gonna spend a lot of money on a mouse and you plan to keep it for a long time. Two really nice pros though are, you can charge it and use it simultaneously unlike the Magic Mouse. And there's wireless charging which the Magic Mouse can't do as well. The two things that I just can't seem to get over are, well, one thing I mentioned earlier, the width of this part here and the other thing is the scrolling. I knew I wouldn't get the nice benefits of the Magic Mouse scrolling but overall the scrolling, sometimes just feels rough. Like sometimes when I'm scrolling, it kinda feels and sounds like the wheel is grinding a little bit. It doesn't feel smooth or consistent like you would get with a typical scroll wheel. I don't know maybe I just need to take it apart and jiggle some things but I'm pretty sure that's how it felt before I even opened it. So I don't think my disassembly ruined the wheel but yeah, it does feel and sound a little weird. And then when you're scrolling in an application, it just doesn't feel very smooth. And that may not be a problem with the wheel itself, that's just a problem with wheels in general. You're not gonna get that nice smooth inertia scrolling that you can get with the Magic Mouse or the built in track pad. And you're not gonna get that omnidirectional scrolling either with a mouse like this. Yeah, you can hold on Shift to go left and right but it's not the same thing. So everything else is really cool and if you guys wanna try it out, I encourage you to check out the Lunar Artefacts website, then give it a shot. But another thing I also encourage you to check out is my awesome friends at Linode. They've helped me out a bunch over the years and they can help you out too.

    "transcript": "(computer bell blips) (upbeat techno music) - Hey guys, how are you all doing? If you're new here, welcome, my name is Krazy Ken, and today we're gonna talk about something that's been buzzing on the Interwebs recently, Caviar's Apple 1 iPhone 12 Pro case, which allegedly ships with a piece of an Apple 1 computer board inside of the case. Now that's an incredibly rare and valuable piece of computer history, so that's sounds pretty insane, but it looks like Caviar has done some insane stuff before, so it's their MO. Many other YouTubers have covered stuff like this before, and MKBHD has definitely talked about this stuff before. Recently, he talked about their case, which has a piece of the moon built into it as well, so Caviar's been doing this stuff for a while. I always was a bit skeptical about their products. I'm not an expert on things like gold and all of that stuff, so I can't really tell if that's fake or not, and I'm definitely not a master on the moon. I can't disprove that's a piece of the moon in that case. I don't know how any of that stuff works until now. You see, this product, that's a little bit more in my wheelhouse. Right off the bat, this product is fake. So don't go spending the near $10,000 it costs on it. I mean, if you still wanna get one and pretend you have a rare piece of history with you, sure, but just keep in mind, this is fake, and we will dive into the details soon. But first, I wanted to talk about what kinda tripped my suspicions at first. Really, the things that tripped my bull (buzzer buzzes) detector was the concept itself. First off, why would you destroy such a rare and valuable piece of computer history just to make an iPhone case? And second, if the board truly was real and you cut it up into pieces, you just lost a ton of value there. Apple 1 computers sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars at auction. Some go up to like 800, $900,000, so why would you break this thing apart and sell phone cases? On the Caviar website, they say there's only nine available, and they sell for $9,990 each. So if you multiply that together that's $89,910 gross in sales, which is nothing compared to how much you could get at an auction for an Apple 1. Now to be fair, there is also an Apple 1 Lite model, which sells for 4,990, and Caviar says they have 49 of those available. So that equals $244,510, which is a lot closer to what one may get at an auction for a legit Apple 1. But it still doesn't seem worth the hassle you would have to face as a company trying to sell dozens of product. So again, financially, this makes no sense. And Caviar kinda proved this already by themselves. In their product video, they show how much money Apple 1 computers can go for at auction, so they kind of already did the math for us, and they showed us why this product makes no sense from a business and finance standpoint. So those were the two things that initially tripped my BS detector. But there's more to it. Why exactly is this a fake? Let's take a look. The next red flag were the product photos on the Caviar website. They look like CGI renderings, which definitely doesn't help prove any legitimacy. Also, their product video shows designs which are not consistent with the website photos. So those things were making me a lot more suspicious, so I was being cautious here. But something that made me even more suspicious were the photos of the physical board that they posted on their website. The Apple 1 board on their website has not component solder to it. Throughout all of the research I've done I have never seen an Apple 1 board, a real Apple 1 board, without the components on it. And in fact, I know an owner of a real Apple 1, Jimmy Grewal, and I asked him about this. He actually also brought up this concern on Twitter, and we talked a bit, and he said the same thing. He was like, \"I have never seen a board without the components on it already. So that led me to believe that this was just a replica Apple 1 board. There's a bunch of 'em out there. Jimmy sent me an eBay listing of an Apple 1 replica board, and to me, the board looked just like the one Caviar had on their website. And not only that, but some of the photos on the Caviar website are exact copies of the photos from the eBay listing. But they had some masks and other photo manipulations applied. So it's fair to say that Caviar just bought this board, this replica board off eBay, and they're selling these overpriced iPhone cases pretending it's a real Apple 1 board, even though it's not. Now, I can't confirm the legitimacy or the lack of legitimacy for Caviar's other products, but if this one is fake, in my opinion, I think it's fair to say that 90% of their other stuff is fake, too. One more note, Jimmy is talking to another expert to help confirm that this is a replica board, and in the initial conversations with him, the expert did say he's 100% sure this is a replica board, but he's only about 90% sure this board is the same board as the eBay listing. I'm pretty sure it is, but we'll let him get to the final 10%. He was saying he could definitely find out if he was able to get his hands on a fragment of the board, but I highly doubt Caviar is going to release that. So between the three of us, if we can get in touch with Caviar and they can send a piece out, which they probably won't (laughs), we'll look into it some more. So the odds are slim we'll get anything out of that, but we'll see. Overall, in regards to the scam-busting episodes I do on Crazy Ken's Tech Talk, I just wanna help you nurture your bull detector so you can help yourself and your friends from accidentally spending too much money on a product that's just surrounded in deceitful marketing. So just keep thinking critically, keep fact-checking, and you'll live a beautiful life. And if you haven't checked out MKBHD's other videos in regards to Caviar, do check those out, and hey, hopefully he can see this one that I just made, too, 'cause hey, that'd be pretty awesome. And if you'd like to check out the other scam-busting episodes I did, feel free to check 'em out here, and feel free to subscribe for more tech episodes every week. And if you see any other fishy products you wanna send my way, feel free to just send me a tweet or a DM on Twitter. I'm pretty active on Twitter, so that's a good way to get a hold of me. And hey, if you liked this episode, you know what to do. Thanks for sticking with me, catch the crazy, and pass it on. (upbeat techno music) (computer bell blips)",

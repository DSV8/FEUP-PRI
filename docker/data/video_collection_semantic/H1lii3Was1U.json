    "transcript": "up until this point every time that i've looked for a pre-built to buy for a video i just kind of vaguely decide on a budget go on to a website and then pick the first thing that looked even remotely interesting to me but then i decided i should buy something that i know is relevant to all of you something that people are buying a lot of so in standard fashion i decided to treat amazon as a generalization for all of humanity's shopping behavior and looked for the most popular gaming pre-built on the website which actually turned out to be a much more interesting hardware configuration than i was expecting i thought it was just going to be the standard i5 10 400 f with a single 8 gig stick of ram and a gtx 1650 in it for around 850 however the specs are actually completely different it seems like the most popular gaming system on amazon is this i buy power system for about 600 us dollars that has a ryzen 3 3 100 in it what i assumed to be a single 8 gig stick of ram and an rx 550 graphics card in it a hardware configuration that i've never interacted with before so i'm really excited to check out this system and more than that i've also never checked out and i buy power system before and going off the recent gamers nexus video on one this could be one hell of a ride uh yeah so with that let's check out the crap that you all have been buying [Music] as we'd all expect the best-selling gaming system on amazon does seem to have a strong emphasis on rgb and tempered glass side panels we've also got a reasonable amount of damage on the box so yeah hopefully this case made it in one piece wow compared to the standard e-waste peripherals you get this mouse seems like it may actually not flare up your chlamydia uh well i'll use it and then let you know how it holds up however the keyboard does seem to have the standard e-waste peripheral build quality ooh we get a link to a free gift hopefully it's not malware over here we have reasonable packing foam with a plastic bag that i don't know makes it feel a little bit like this case was just carelessly stuffed into a box it's got a strong smell why does that smell so chemical like that puts aliexpress chemical smell to shame holy crap feel like the bags maybe a little big there we go wait where's my mouse pad it says clearly that it comes with an element mini pro mouse pad and it's nowhere in the packaging oh that's 0 out of 10 right there i buy power starting off with the front we can see we have two rgb fans behind a mesh front which we know is good for airflow the front i o is perfectly inoffensive and then we've got this slot that's barely a finger width for the airflow around the back we've got a bit of instruction telling us to not use the hdmi on the motherboard let's actually see what this i o looks like uh it's possible it's fine the sticker leaves a bunch of like glue residue on the back that's not good they could have just used a bit of tape or something i find the sticker really weird because it says here that it's assembled from tested components which is good but then they stipulate under there that the complete system is not tested so the system could not boot due to like assembling issues and they wouldn't have caught it at the factory yeah that's that's a bit weird uh down here we've got the graphics card i'm assuming that's the rx 550 and then we've got another bit of instruction on the power supply here which says that we need to read instructions about removing the foam on the inside of the system and then around the side we can't actually see the components in here because of all that packing foam we need to remove first okay now inside the system we've got decent cable management everything seems to be plugged in properly as well although the front i o headers are just about to wriggle free down there now when it comes to the component choices first off we've got the infamous single stick of ram however in this motherboard that only has two ram slots i guess it kind of makes sense for future upgradeability although considering that this is a ryzen cpu i would definitely factor a ram upgrade into this purchase moving over to the cooler we've got something that looks like it would be embarrassing to whip out on a first date the motherboard is an asrock a320m ac which is fairly standard for a lower budget amd based system it's not a great motherboard but i i guess it'll get the job done and then down here we've got some asrock variant of the rx 550 and then we've also got a bit of like cable tie hanging there randomly i don't know that bit of cable tie there looks a lot like it's bridging a connection between the pci connector on the graphics card and that capacitor on the motherboard i'm gonna leave it there and see what it does just because you know out of the box testing and all that the back is a bit rough uh there was definitely a whole lot of stuffing going on here at least there's the occasional bit of cable tie but um yeah this isn't as good as that lenovo legion that i recently looked at now when it comes to power supply they do that very strategic thing where there's no information about it on the side that you can easily see so yeah we're gonna have to take that power supply out and see what we're working with here the power supply is a 500 watt 80 plus bronze rated unit by a company called channel well technology um yeah i think this is where the strong chemical smell was coming from i don't know this power supply is about as confidence inspiring as a coal mine where the canaries keep dying and then the ssd is something called a neo forza 256 gig drive i've not heard of that company before uh i'll do some tests to see how that performs okay so on first impressions i guess it's kind of better than i was expecting although i was half expecting a medium-sized highway pileup so it's not like it's not like my expectations were particularly high uh yeah let's put it back together and see how it runs okay that was good uh nothing exploded there okay it's vd time um this is just fairly standard windows vd although there is like an i buy power does it just take you to their website oh you need internet oh it just takes you to their review site wait so do you only get a reward if you give them a positive review that's kind of the implication there but i'm sure that's not how that works uh anyway okay so that is what that button does and then we do have some amd drivers on here so that's good and yeah i mean that's actually way better than i was expecting the the vd situation on this i buy power is pretty decent the drivers on here are actually up to date i think that's the first time i've ever seen that so that's pretty cool gaming wise we're starting with an old fan favorite gta 5 this is um oh this is already going better than i was expecting i'm using 1080p here all normal settings so it's pretty much the lowest settings at 1080p for gta 5 and yeah we definitely have some headroom here because we're averaging about 100 ish frames per second it seems component temperatures are also good so far okay so even with slightly higher graphics so we've got some anti-aliasing on here and a like tessellation has been set up with a bit of anastrophic filtering as well we're still in about the mid 80s to low 90s so yeah this is this is definitely better than i was expecting considering what i've oh so here we have cs go 1080p all low settings uh i've played a couple of matches and it it's okay um it's not an amazing cs go experience but i guess it's like a minimum acceptable kind of performance to be competitive online there is the occasional hiccup and like frame drop and stuff that's definitely noticeable yeah if you're like a high level cs go player this may not work for you but if you're more of a little newbie maybe i will say i am surprised at how good the cpu temps are it is only pulling about 25 watts at the moment rainbow six siege here is running at 1080p and we've got the medium preset going um yeah it's about 60 frames per second this is okay like it's it's like a minimum acceptable again the same as with cs go uh in medium settings 1080p it's not gonna give you a hernia or whatever okay so at this point i guess it's quite make a break for this system whether or not it can run fortnite and with 1080p is that another player yeah i think so oh i need to get closer wait what was i saying oh yes it's important that the game runs fine so here with 1080p competitive settings um yeah it feels okay like this is very playable it's not going to win you any ep points online but that's what the rgb and the tempered glass is for so yeah you've got all your bases covered here now something a bit more demanding this is battlefield 5 1080p with low settings this is not what i would call a usable battlefield 5 gaming experience uh the frame rate will definitely be holding you back and uh there are going to be times where you die very frustratingly because of like frame rate dips and stuff like that so even at low settings battlefield v is a bit of a no-go performance-wise the system is fine i guess if what you're looking for is like a possible esports gaming machine the problem is though the the performance you get out of this system is very comparable to something like an old optiplex with a gt 1030 in it which just that feels so rough for hundred dollars like there are advantages to this system over an optiplex like you've got an upgrade path you've got tempered glass rgb and ep and all that but still six hundred dollars for basically gt 1030 performance but on the performance front you can't even really recommend an old optiplex with a 1030 in it anymore because even the 1030 has become this weird rare thing that you need to spend your entire life savings on however taking all of that into account i still wouldn't recommend spending 600 on one of these species or any pre-built for that matter i would save up till i get to about 800 or 850 um because you'd get a lot more performance for not a significantly bigger outlay but yeah all in all the i buy power system wasn't nearly as much of a train smash as i was expecting it to be and it shows you that even within the same manufacture there is quite a big variety in the condition of the system that you're gonna get and if you end up actually buying an ibuypower system you just need to hope that whoever's building it wasn't drunk and or on drugs at the time and with that it brings me to the end of the video thank you very much for watching if you liked it please do like and subscribe to the channel for more videos like this one and until the next video bye-bye [Music] you",

    "transcript": "- [Narrator] From where I'm sitting, this is the last time the company can hike its prices without a significant upgrade in design or camera performance. That's how I closed out my review of the last OnePlus smart phone. The OnePlus 5T released in November 2017. Well, wouldn't you know it, the OnePlus 6, announced moments ago, features an upgraded design, better camera specs, and yes, a little price hike to go with them. I'm Mr. Mobile, and this is a quick look brought to you by dbrand. (upbeat music) Let's start off with my favorite, design. The OnePlus 6 comes in three color ways, though if the company's past habits are any indication, we can expect to get more color options in the coming months. This is the first time OnePlus has offered a glass on glass design since 2015. Now typically a manufacturer which goes this route will offer wireless charging along with it. But unfortunately that's no where to be seen. I've got two versions of the black trim in the studio, midnight black and black mirror, mirror black, sorry. These are pretty typical looking phones for 2018, right down to the notch at the top of the display. If you want to spice it up, you can still buy cases directly from OnePlus with finishes from faux wood to the classic sandstone, which traces it's roots all the way back to the OnePlus 1. This year there's a new entrant as well, a wrap around rubber case with a ballistic nylon back plate that reminds me of Motorola's Droid Turbo. This is the way to go if you want a rugged look and feel, and speaking of, OnePlus says the 6 was designed to be \"Water-resistant for everyday occasions\". Don't get your hopes up there, there's no IP rating, which presumably would have added cost. So the company makes clear, it's talking about puddles and rain showers, not any kind of emersion. Heading inside, inside the phone, the internals are just what you would expect from OnePlus. Raw power to the point of absurdity. A Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 backed up with up to eight gigs of RAM is overkill to say the least. That's not really new. The OnePlus 5T had the same option, and a bunch of the other specs will be familiar too, from the battery capacity to the dash charger that keeps that battery topped up. The biggest improvements have been to the display, which grows in size from six to about 6.3 inches, thanks mainly to the notch, And more importantly, the camera. Optical stabilization makes a return to the main shooter, having been omitted from the last two phones. And yet again, OnePlus changes up it's strategy for the secondary camera. It's not for zoom or low-light this time, but exclusively to help out with portrait mode. The bigger improvements are in video, with support for 4K60 and slow-mo recording up to 480 fps. Stay tuned for more testing on that front, as I haven't even been using this phone long enough to move into either of its SIM slots. I'm also not yet allowed to talk about some things, like how the notch plays with apps. That'll have to wait for a full review coming soon. But there's nothing stopping me from calling out my favorite feature making it's return, the mute switch. Started with Palm and moved to Apple, but it's just OnePlus keeping the dream alive on Android these day. Also old but useful, the headphone jack sticks around. A good thing since the speaker is the same old single bottom-edged nonsense as always. And from the limited exploring I have done in the software, this looks a lot like previous Oxygen OS builds. A very light skin with smart features and nearly instant reaction times. Speaking of skins, today's sponsor has a thing or two you might want to take a look at. Dbrand is not just a Twitter account that serves up sick burns. It's a company that makes the best darn vinyl skins you're gonna find for your smartphone. You can even double it up with one of the official OnePlus cases. If you want to be that guy or gal. Like in the description if you want to snag your own with all the money you saved on this phone. Hey, segway alert. That's the most important question when it comes to a OnePlus phone isn't it. Are you still getting more than you'd expect for the money? Well when it goes on sale May 22nd, the OnePlus 6 will start at $529 for the 64 gig model. And then if you end up making use of all those camera features, you'll want the larger storage option. That costs $50 more. That still keeps it under 600 bucks, which is good. But with Google's excellent Pixel2 starting at $649, well we're getting into dodgy territory for a brand which build it's reputation on blockbuster value. The camera and battery life will be deciding factors here, and for my full review featuring those, be sure you're subscribed to the Mr. Mobile on YouTube. In the meantime, let me know what you think. Has one plus finally pushed to far into premium pricing? Vote in the poll below. And ask your questions on Twitter in my AMA with Android Central using the simple and straightforward hashtag on your screen. Until next time, thanks for watching. And stay mobile my friends.",

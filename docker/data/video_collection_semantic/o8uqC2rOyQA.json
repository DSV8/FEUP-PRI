    "transcript": "hello good people i'm dmitry and i've been very happy with razer they've been in my good books for their most recent uh gaming peripheral releases and the v2 cycle products aim to bring appropriate improvements for 2020 and this is exactly what is promised with the new ornata v2 keyboard launching at $99 just like the original my first reaction when i heard the price was absolutely not when the huntsman t is only 20 cheaper and it fits my gaming style perfectly but then i wonder if all the added value features on the ornata v2 make it worth your time of course nothing beats a proper mechanical switch but i gotta say the hybrid mechanical switch on here feels pretty nice i feel like the clicky nature for mechanical lookalike is the proper direction and they must have done something with the switch because it feels much better and improved versus the original ornata chroma on the chroma the keys kind of got stuck on the way up whereas with the v2 the rebounds is much cleaner all right so first of all there are a few differences on the frame versus the original chroma keyboard like the added media keys that are also mecha mechanical and a small volume wheel with good texture and click to mute functionality and instant volume adjustment but the scroll steps are pretty weak with little tactility still a better volume wheel toe than the embarrassment that is on the 250 g915 let's not get too excited about the included wrist rest it's cool that is magnetic and the thin foam padding is nice for a little bit of comfort to flatten out your wrist posture but this surface traps so much heat and i had to stop using it because it got really sweaty also i think the reason they went with low profile keycaps is because the actual keyboard frame is chunky so the height of the v2 is about the same as a standard keyboard with normal keycaps they are abs of course but i like the slightly matte texture and clean beautiful font that is a bit too thin so not much lighting gets through but still it's a very pretty font but the white under plate helps to evenly spread all that rgb goodness around the keycaps you can remove the keycaps to see in the membrane switch and the clicking mechanism just don't expect to swap out the keycaps given the stem design as you type the keyboard does not flex but it is a plastic frame after all so the build quality is pretty lean the cable is non-removable but they added the cable routing channels at the bottom with extra long braided cable and here we also have the dual step angle adjustment that are nice and stable and i initially thought this keyboard was spill and water resistant because of these holes throughout the frame you can actually see illumination uh shining right through them i thought those would be considered to be like drain ports where if liquid is spilled on top of the keyboard it does make its way out through those holes but it isn't and razer have confirmed this is not a waterproof spill proof keyboard and so the highlight here then would be the mecca membrane clicky switches they don't feel exactly clean and crisp like your blues and greens but they do have really satisfying softness when you bottom out it's almost like there is a thick fabric at the bottom of the frame that absorbs the impact but it isn't it's the rubber dome now the clicky point is somewhere in the middle so it doesn't happen instantaneously you have to depress the key a little bit and the sound is sharp and they feel quite good and i actually really appreciate this keyboard for typing because the actuations are not as loud as your traditional clicky switches i really like the sound profile but my issue here is consistency as i feel like the clicky point is slightly higher on certain keys and also the stem design introduces a lot of wobble into all of the keys basically especially the large ones and after having spent some time in game with the ornata v2 it's not a bad experience but having no competitive advantage makes this product almost dead on arrival for example the razer huntsman keyboard has been sitting under 100 for the past three months and this is a better keyboard experience in all aspects then we have the really affordable and highly reviewed red dragon with mx blues giving you the cliquey feel but under 50 dollars with an actual mechanical switch and even combo deals from have it that are half the price of the v2 making me feel like razer really dropped the ball here because this is the same keyboard from 2017 with the same price point we just added media keys and the new cable channels but come on guys that isn't enough to be competitive what i feel like razer should have done with the ornata v2 is make it water and spill resistant to be competitive versus the corsair k55 which is also in that rubber dome territory but it's half the price and it is waterproof and it's a full-size keyboard it does everything the v2 does but is much cheaper and it's also waterproof so if you have a hundred dollars to spend on the keyboard many other options should cross your mind including the steelseries apex 5. this keyboard also has hybrid mechanical clicky switches it's also priced at 99. but with a much better build quality pretty lighting and a kind of cool gimmicky oled screen by the way let me know if you want me to do a full comparison between the apex 5 and the ornata v2 which i think should have been priced at 69 or lower because otherwise it is a hard pass all right guys i'm dmitry thanks so much for watching check out this other relevant content subscribe for more i'll talk to you in the next video",

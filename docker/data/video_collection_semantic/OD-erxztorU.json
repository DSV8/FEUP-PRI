    "transcript": "- Hey guys, this is Austin. So you've probably seen a lot of tech under videos so all of the tech I'm going to take a look at, five items in total, cost less than $30. The twist is, I have no idea if any of it is remotely good. This is the ZTE Maven 2. How much was this? - [Ken] $30. - $30 exactly, okay, all right. So this guy is rocking Android Marshmallow 6.0.1 which is only like two years old, so not that bad, I guess. Eight gigs of storage, a five inch touchscreen, which actually looks like a pretty decent size for $30. You know, it always surprises me how much you can get for so cheap, especially when it comes to smartphones. So last year, I spent a little while with a $20 smartphone and while it probably was not as good as this, it was kind of usable. It's definitely plasticy, although to be fair, it doesn't have the battery in it yet so that might help a little bit. The first thing that jumps out to me is that the screen is actually pretty decent. So yes, it's definitely low resolution, it gets pretty bright, and that same thing goes for the build quality. It's not perfect, it definitely is very plasticy, but it feels reasonably sturdy. Okay, yeah, that's a lot of bloatware. Get a shot of Savage Kenny. Oh wait, no wait, no, we gotta switch over to fun mode. Oh, it totally worked. So it will actually take the picture when you smiled. That's actually kind of cool, all right. I'll give them that. Okay, it won't stop taking pictures of me. Okay, all right, so we're recording. This is the 720p video. Ken, you're looking not as savage as usual. (laughing) I'm done. So, is the Maven 2 worth $30? Yeah, when I saw a $30 smartphone, I had pretty low expectations. When you consider that this is 1/20 the price of a flagship, and it does basically everything. Maybe it's not quite as fast or not quite as sexy, but at the end of the day, it's hard to argue with a smartphone at this price. All right, so that actually wasn't bad. What do we have for item number two? (drumming) (laughing) The Roku Express? So for reference, this is about $5 cheaper than a Chromecast. So we have the Express itself, which kind of looks like an IR receiver. We also have a USB wall adapter, some batteries, and what you don't get with a Chromecast is an actual remote. This is actually a lot of stuff for $30. I will say that navigating through the interface actually is reasonably snappy. It's a little bit of a different thing than a Chromecast because that really does rely on you casting things from a phone or a computer or something whereas this is more meant to be used with the remote and as a proper streaming box. This totally works. So there's really not that much exciting about the Roku Express, for $30, you are getting a pretty solid standalone experience. Oh boy, the mini wired controller for XBOX One and Windows. To be fair, I have not used a third party controller for a console since the Playstation 2 days, but this just looks really cheap. Oh boy, that's some shiny plastic. (laughing) Oh, it's a wired controller, okay. I guess that makes sense. Putting the mini controller side by side with the full sized one, it actually isn't a huge difference in size. It's a little bit smaller, but what really jumps out to me is that this doesn't feel that bad. So the glossy plastic definitely looks super cheap, but having the textured finish on the back actually feels pretty nice. More importantly, it feels like a solid controller, so there's really no flex in it. Maybe just a little bit if I really torque it. That is a lot of auto aim. (laughing) The controller itself feels pretty good. It definitely is a little different from the normal XBOX One controller and for $20 less, I don't know if the difference is really going to be worth it. Maybe if you were just playing on PC, you don't care about a wireless option, it's fine. You even do have the impulse triggers and you also have the death, that's more important. You have the death. The Corsair Katar FPS and MOBA gaming mouse. Another $30, actually did a good job of getting everything exactly on point. So have four programmable buttons and we also have on the fly DPI tuning. That sounds exciting. For $30, though, if this actually isn't too bad, that's going to be pretty solid for a gaming mouse. That actually feels pretty good. So the entire thing is coated in a sort of soft touch rubber. Oh yeah, that actually feels pretty good. It's a little bit on the smaller side though. What really jumps out to me is that this feels a lot better than most sort of cheap, low end mice. The tracking is nice and responsive and I think it might be a little bit on the smaller side for some people, but more importantly, it feels really nice. So far, I actually think we've been doing pretty good, but it's time to see what the final item is. Mister Bolido. Cinderella Girl? Ha ha, very funny. Lightning AirPods? Oh cool, something I actually wanted to do a video on. The Sony MDRVX110, a powerful, high-quality sound. How much were these? - [Ken] $14. - $14? All right, $14 it is. It's been a while since I've tried cheap headphones and even those were usually ear buds, so, oh, the folding mechanism actually doesn't feel that bad. I mean, they're definitely cheap and plastic, but for $14, you really shouldn't expect anything too crazy. Pull out our super cool ZTE Maven, probably not the greatest headphone amp but I'm curious. What? A bag of Doritos? What? Why does that smell so bad? Wait, what are these? A USB cable and some really terrible headphones? Wait, wait, wait, what is this? While you're crunching on the boldest snack in the universe, plug your headphones straight into the front of the bag, play, and rock out to songs from Marvel Studios' Guardians of the Galaxy soundtrack. There's a headphone jack on the bag? Okay, hold on, hold on. So I just plug in and just do it? (laughing) Where did you get this bag? (laughing) Oh, this is a Ken and Jimmy special, huh? - [Jimmy] Hell yeah. - All right, that's actually cool. So the headphones sound good when you plug them into a bag of Doritos. Something I never thought I would say. Okay, that was actually kind of cool. Let me try it with some real music. So, are these going to match really expensive headphones? Absolutely not, but especially if you're coming from something like a headphone that's included with your phone, these sound a lot nicer. There's a little bit of lack of clarity, especially when you get towards the bassier side of things, but for $14, this actually might be my favorite thing here. As always, I'll have links to all this stuff in the description of this video, with the possible exception of the Doritos bag, which I don't think costs $30 anymore, but let me know in the comments, which one of these pieces of tech would you guys pick up for $30? Let me know in the comments below and I will catch you on the next one.",

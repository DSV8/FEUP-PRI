    "transcript": "- Hello and welcome to This Is. Today we're trying beauty tech from Wish, because well let's face it, we're both incredibly beautiful already. - I know I'm gorgeous. - But you know what? We could always use a little pick me up, a little improvement and we can start out with the Colorful LED Beauty Mask. - So do you know what pisses me off? So at CES, I tried out, the wonderful LED beauty mask that people said made me look 20 years younger. - Look, you made a great thumbnail, that's all I cared about. - It did, however, that was supposed to be cutting edge I mean that's what CES is all about. Yet we found seemingly the exact same mask on Wish - How much was this? - Only $40 dollars which to be fair, is actually quite expensive. - Yeah, that's actually-- - Than anything on Wish, 'cause everything else is like a dollar or free. Wait for it. (rock music) - [Austin] Oh, it's even worse on the back do you see that? It's just a little bunch of LED, why. - I mean that's the whole point, it's an LED mask. Austin, do you know how I know that we are an official YouTube channel now. Hello darkness my old friend - It's not because we have 200,000 subscribers. It's because we are officially sponsored by Raid: Shadow Legends. Are you sick of your RPGs being cutesy unicorn farts? Then join Raid: Shadow Legends for deep dark epic battles. Battle through dungeons to earn epic artifacts or upgrade your champions at the tavern or even join the arena to help me beat Austin over here. Raid: Shadow Legends is the number one free to play mobile game, and now it's even cross platform with your desktop, so you can play all your favorite characters right on your PC or Mac. You can find me in game under the nickname, \"This is Matt\" and you can even join my clan to help me beat Austin over here. New players can check out the link in description below to get a bonus hundred thousand silver and a free champion Hex Weaver. So what are you waiting for? Go check it out, It's awesome, It's fun. Link in description. Thanks Raid: Shadow Legends for sponsoring this video. So here's something that it actually has over the CES version. It has a chin attachment so you're neck can look young too. There are zero instructions in this box. - They're like little pegs with like springs. - I don't, I have no, no there's nothing else in this box other than bubble wrap. - Look There's no use in talking anymore. Let's use our LED of doom machine. Not funny. (laughs) Look I already don't like this, I don't like this at all. (laughs) That's a major power adapter, so we need to plug this in to the controller. - Oh God, I feel like I'm in Jabbawockeez like, - Bust a move Matt, bust a move. (techno music) All right, so we had to plug the controller in and we use our USB 3.0 ports to actually power the different options. - No, no, I feel right in this. Oh okay, now I know what the things are for, they're for like, to contour your face. - [Austin] Oh, so it's like a little rubber pad to sit on your face so you can kinda get it closer. - All right, so the chin attaches like that. - Can we just take a second here and realize? (laughs) The use of this. It looks you broke your neck. The use of this, is it supposed to be a skin whitener, but it's just LEDs. - So. - Don't laugh, don't laugh in that, it's so much worse. (laughing) - I can't help it. I can't move my head. So like I'm trying to see. There are different color LEDs and each one has a different function. Red is for like anti aging. - No. - I mean I feel younger in this, look how smooth my skin is. Blue is for acne which I tend to have, I have acne rosacea. It's like it runs in my family, so this blue could really help but you know what, because you keep telling me I'm old, it has a purple function, which is both anti aging and acne control. I'm gonna be the most beautiful 12 year old that you could possibly see, all right, but then. - Cancel the channel, cancel the channel, we've gone too far. - I can't if I could just okay, so we plug in here, it is nice that they went with USB three on both sides. - I don't understand why, because it needs so much power or something? (clicks) (laughs) Oh no. Matt no, it looks like you're like marshmallow or something. What the hell, Matt. Matt no, no look, this is-- - All right, there's my purple. (laughs) - It's like a ball that's, (laughs) - 6 wait, 69 nice like everything is just 69. (laughs) Was this made by like a 12 year old boy just, nice. (laughs) All right, so I'm gonna leave this on for a couple minutes. While we talk about the next part. - No, no, no, no, no, get over here I wanna try that. (shouts) (laughs) I don't like this. - The red looks good. - It's like I'm a boss, I'm about to die you're like this is your cue to finish me off. - This isn't even your final form. - What is happening? - Green is your gland function which helps with bacteria, but also gives you that whiter skin. - Oh yeah, definitely something I need is a whiter skin. - I know right? I mean, I think you and me are the whitest people on the planet. The best way I can describe this, is think of the worst nightmare that you've ever had. That's it, this is it. - I am not gonna be able to make it to the video right now I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna make it. - For 40 bucks this is a good price. - No, it's ridiculous LEDs don't like colored light doesn't change anything. This is not like a reverse tanning bed. - Next on the list, we have the, - Absolutely I will not try that one. - EMS hips trainer, but it said it was a whole 14 piece system, for your abs, your packs, your arms, but it seems that they only sent us, - Look we're getting demonetized. - The butt one. - We're getting demonetized. - Matt you know you're the one wearing this right? - It doesn't cover my size. (laughs) - When we decided to make this as a channel, we're like you know what, we're gonna do happy fun days. Everyone's going to enjoy, it's gonna be a good time by all and then this horror show shows up and I have to put this on my butt. Are you okay? - I can't see. - You're slowly becoming more and more like weird. - Well 'cause I know that there's a mic here, this box. - It does actually look quite old, It's very faded. - Faded. - [Congregation] Drank? (laughs) - Oh, what the. (beeps) - Okay. - Oh it is a whole kit, take your shirt off. - I will never ever get that one out of my head. - Hey boy take your shirt off. (laughs) - Oh Matt it's, (sniffs) ugh, it smell so bad. - All right. - Smell that. Wait how much was this? I've totally forgot to ask. - This was only $22 dollars. So who needs a gym membership when you could just get these? Why does it slap? - I don't know okay, are you ready? I'm just gonna start pressing buttons until something happens. - All right. - Okay, so on, It's at one. - I literally feel nothing. - Okay, well it's okay, hold on it's on okay ready and, - Oh! - I see you twitching, I see you twitching. - Yeah. - Are you doing that on purpose? - No. - Okay, let me turn it off now. - Okay. - Okay, it's off. - All right, let's go three. (groans) My chin fell off. - So essentially what this is, is an electroshock exercise method where instead of you actually working out your muscles, it just shocks you until you twitch and then apparently that burns calories and builds muscle. - It doesn't hurt. - It's very uncomfortable. - But it doesn't feel great. - I've done these kind of thing, not this specifically I'm not gonna do this because I hate electricity but it's a weird. - You're not gonna do this? I got this specifically for you. That's why we got the butt one. (laughs) - Matt, Matt, give me this. - No, you put mine on. (slaps) - Oh, oh it's so slimy. - So here we go, we get checked. - I hate this, I hate this. - We get you on one. - I hate this already. - Let's just crank it out. - Look one. Oh, okay, okay, okay, all right, so it feels like little bits of like, (zaps) Matt we could drag this out and I could go through two, three and four. I'm just gonna go straight to four and, - Go four, go for it, that's only one. (mumbles) (groans) Ow, what's going on here. (laughs) - All right, we're done, we're done, we're done. (groans) (laughs) I'm still shaking like legitimately I feel like I'm still like, I have a deep muscular issue right now of just like, - That's how you know it was a good burn. We have our final product which is a blackhead vacuum. I have I think worse with black heads than you. So I'm gonna test this out because I don't think this is gonna work as fast as I want to. I got for you, some leading deep sea mud mask from Israel. This I got on Amazon but this is Wish. So these here, they're anywhere from $22 dollars, to free you just pay for shipping, that's great. - Is shipping $22 dollars by chance. - Yeah it was, it was. The shipping was definitely the same price. - I feel like I can do a mud mask like whatever like, - I'll let you open that 'cause you're so cocky about it. But we're gonna see who has the better acne, fixer game in fixing things. - Well I think yours is actually, you're just gonna look way worse because if it's sucking, you're gonna have like red welts from where it like vacuums out of your face. - That's why we're doing this later in the day. Ow, ow, ow, oh, oh, it's stuck. - You're beautiful yet? - Ow, oh! - You'll be helpful if I had a mirror right now. - Yeah I mean, the same thing but I mean, I feel like you need to be more liberal with that. - I can't see very well though so, - I mean, take a big old chunk. You have a monitor right there. - Yeah but I don't have my glasses on. - Oh that's right you're blind. - Yeah I'm blind. - All right, so like this here feels like it's doing something but I don't think it is. - I don't know man. You're asking the wrong guy I'm just putting mud on my face. Are we more beautiful now? - I don't think so, but you guys tell us. - Who's the more beautiful? Is it shirtless zapped Austin? Is it weird face mask Matt? Is it the mud mask? Maybe the blackhead sucker. Thank you very much for watching this episode of This Is, you should definitely be sure to subscribe, just in case we do another one of these again, which we shouldn't but it's very possible that we might. Matt any final words before we let the audience go about their day of wasting time on YouTube? - If there's other products you want us to check out, let me know in the comments. But I'm gonna go home and sleep with this mask because I wanna look beautiful.",

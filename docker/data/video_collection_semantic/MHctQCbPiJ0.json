    "transcript": "(chill electronic music) - Are these the new iPhones that are going to be announced? I don't know. No, clearly, they are not. These are just some fake dummy phones. They're little prototypes. You've probably seen a bunch of people with these on YouTube already. My friend Faruque let me borrow these. He got them from somewhere, I don't even know where. Either way, we've got them here for some size comparisons. What we potentially could have in store, in our hands, very, very shortly. Let's just jump into some of the rumors. First of all, the biggest rumor is what is this new phone going to be called? There's three phones that the rumors are saying will be announced. First up is the iPhone 10S MAX, so instead the plus, they're now replacing the plus with max and again, everything I'm saying is complete rumors. I know nothing at all. Everything that I'm saying I have read somewhere on the internet. 6.5-inch OLED, edge-to-edge stainless steel around the edges glass back, and the iPhone 10S, which would probably be about the same size as the previous version of the iPhone 10, this one would be a 5.8-inch OLED. I feel like the prices probably would be sort of similar. I think this one, I would assume, would range from $800 to $900, and a bunch of people were speculating that the iPhone 10S MAX would be anywhere from $900 to $1,000 to $1,100, it really all depends. They'll probably be various different sizes. There's also been rumors that there's going to be a 512 gigabyte model. I don't even think that I've filled up my 256 yet. It's also been speculated that there will be dual SIM cards, which is kind of exciting if you do travel abroad, you won't have to keep switching SIM cards when you're traveling internationally, and it has been kind of cool because when I do travel, I have other phones that do dual SIM cards, and it's kind of incredible 'cause it just switches, you don't have to worry about it. Then that brings us to, not the real phone but an iPhone 10R so essentially that would be kind of like the iPhone 9. You guys remember last year the iPhone 8 came out first, and then a month later, the iPhone 10 came out. So, I feel like this is sort of the upgrade to the 8. It'll be a little bit less expensive. It'll still have a huge screen, full edge-to-edge display. But it won't be OLED, it'll probably be LCD. These are all rumors, I read it on the internet, who knows. Could be fake news, could be real news, who knows? Because the iPhone 10R will be less expensive, it probably will have aluminum around the edges. It'll come in various colors, gray, white, blue, red. I'm hoping for a pink. Probably a black, potentially an orange, and because the price point will be lower, there may not be 3D touch. Probably won't have dual SIM cards, and it definitely probably won't have a headphone jack either. Another thing people were saying is that the new phones may ship with a USBC to a lightning cable, whereas previous, they would be USBA to the lightning cables so I would be pretty excited about that because I feel like I'm always looking for a USBC to lightning, and I can never find them. One of the things that I've been hoping for a while that the iPhone would switch to is USBC. I doubt it'll happen. Especially people were speculating they're just shipping USBC to lightning, so the likelihood of that really happening is not very likely. So the newer phones will probably come in three colors: silver, space gray, and a rose gold, which I am so excited about. There's also been rumors that there's going to be a shiny, rose gold Series 4 watch. If I have to wait in line, I'll wait in line. If I have to sleep outside, I'll sleep outside. I will do what I have to, unless it's one of those things like the original, when the watch fist was announced, that it was like extremely expensive, it was like $24,000 for the gold watch or something. Then maybe I might skip it. If it's a realistic price, then yeah, I'd sleep outside for it. Of course all of the normal things that you would expect in a new phone: improved battery, faster modem speeds, hopefully faster wireless charging, because right now the wireless charging is pretty slow, so if that is actually a fast charge, I'll be super excited because I love wireless charging. I hate having to carry cables around, but I do like having various docking stations. And speaking of wireless charging, do we even need to bring up, I don't even remember what it's called, power mats, the air mats. No, the power mat was intentional. You can run on the mat, oh my god, that was so much fun, with the track and field game, oh, so great. Back on track, the air power, if that's not released at some point I'm gonna lose my mind. Speaking of air power, because we're talking about air power the air pods would need to have a new pace, so they may be announcing a new case, or entirely new set of air pods, which could potentially have a Siri built in. - [Siri Voiceover] Senior buys the Beverly Hilton, about 3.5 miles to bear east - Oh. - [Siri Voiceover] On Wilshire Boulevard and Beverly Hills, which averages four stars. - You're not safe in my house if you say the trigger words for any smart home thing. Not sure where I left off. New air pods, air power, three new iPhones, new Apple Watch. Let's take a look at some of the rumors because I haven't really got a chance to do much research on the Apple Watch yet. So here on MacRumors, which is my favorite place to go for Mac rumors, like we said before, the 2018 lineup is right here. These are again the dummy models. So you've got your iPhone 10S MAX, iPhone 10R, and the 10S. Obviously the newer versions have the dual camera, it should be 12 megapixels. Here's some glass panels for 2018 models. So you can see the different sizes. And here's the 6.1-inch dummy models in red, blue and white. Three color possibilities. One of the things that a lot of the dummy models do get wrong are the colors, so I feel like that blue is a little bit too dark. I don't think Apple would do a dark blue like that. Here we are: Apple Watch Series 4. This is super exciting. I use my Apple Watch every single day. There's been days where I've forgot, and I've left it on its charger and left the house, and I just have sort of this panic feeling, because I'm so used to having it. And a lot of times I do keep my phone in my purse or in my pocket or my backpack, now especially because I'm riding my bike a lot, I rely a lot on this for Apple maps. If I have a place in my GPS, I can just look at this, it tells me where to go. This is the rose gold that I was talking about. This is one of the leaked images. And it's a much more shiny, kind of, color, so this could be sort of like a stainless steel, with a rose gold plating or a copper, they could be calling it copper, I'm not sure. Here's Series 3, and here's the Series 4, so there's definitely a way bigger screen. I do like it has the rounded edges. I guess you don't really notice that this doesn't have a round-edge display because it's usually a black background anyway, but I do like that that is a larger screen. Longer battery life if enabled through a higher-capacity battery. Improved health monitoring. I use this anytime I'm on a hike. It's interesting because I was at the doctor's one day and I had to get a shot. I don't do well with needles. I think I'm dramatic, my sister knows I'm dramatic, my sister was with me, and I started feeling a lit bit dizzy and she kind of looked at me a little strange, and I was like, I don't think I feel so good. I looked at my watch, my heart rate was, like, 42, and I just sort of slumped. It was one of those things where I had the health data on my wrist to show me that yes, I was actually not feeling well, and I should probably make sure I was sitting down. It was cool because, not that I passed out, but that I had that data right in front of me just to know that what I was feeling wasn't just me being dramatic, it was actually something that I should pay attention to. There's been so many health stories of people who are having heart attacks, and their Apple Watch saved their life. These are Apple Watch upgrades: EKG designed to detect electrical changes in skin caused by rhythm of the heartbeat. It can determine if there are any irregularities, including hardware into the band, including batteries, oh interesting. So what that means is if they have filed these patents then there can be accessories for your Apple Watch, so there could be increased heart rate sensors, there could be something that tests your glucose levels, using sensors. There are so many possibilities if that's the case, which I feel like it's only a natural progression. Another thing that they do announce are new Apple watchbands well, I would be excited to see that. One thing that I am hoping is that there are a little bit more, I guess, higher-end fashion watch bands. There's so many third-party ones, but one of the things that I don't like about the third-party ones is they don't always fit perfectly. I feel like when Apple does it, it fits perfectly. It's a quality product, and I don't have to question whether or not it's gonna work with my watch. So that's something that I'm hoping for, if they do have a rose gold, or if there's, like, a chain link one, or I dunno, I'm not really sure what I'm thinking that I want. That's one of the things that Apple likes to do. They like to make the things that you don't even know that you need. So, thanks, Apple. One thing that I do like is that it looks like there's just a very small red ring around the crown. I know I wasn't a fan of the red, but honestly I never really see it, so it didn't bother me that much. Now that I'm looking at it, I like this way better. So back to what we can expect: air power, like I said, this needs to happen. I mean, this was supposed to be out in 2018. I guess 2018 isn't over, but it sure feels like it is. And here's our air pods. We've got the old and got the new, and as you can see that little light right there is lit up to show you that it's charging. I can't wait to be able to charge everything all at once and just be done with it. Software updates, new version of iOS, MacOS, watchOS, tvOS those have all been in beta, so I don't really feel like... Well, I haven't upgraded to Mojave because I usually wait because I don't wanna have to worry is Final Cut going to act up? Usually it doesn't, but there have been some very small instances, so I usually wait several months until after the OS is out. I can deal with beta on my phone, but I can't deal with beta on the Mac. Possibilities for September and October, iPad Pro, Mac mini, oh, tell me more. Low-cost MacBook Air. 12-inch MacBook, iMacs. Following the debut of the new phones and Apple Watch, September 12, we're expecting Apple to hold pre-orders on Friday, September 14. If Apple sticks to pre-order times from the past year, we can expect orders to be starting at 12:01 a.m. Pacific. Here they're saying if the pre-orders happen on the 14th, then the official launch would be on September 21. So, what does this mean? I don't know. Well, that's pretty much all I have for you guys today. But I will be at the event, so be sure to follow me everywhere on social media @ijustine Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, wherever. I'll be doing some live streams, stay tuned. But that's it. I have to go edit this video, pack and head to Cupertino. I just went through this whole video and now I'm thinking about how crazy it is because when I was younger, this was literally my dream. My dream was to, well, number one my dream was to go and work at Apple, but I never really realized that there would be something else that I could do and sort of cover Apple Tech. I dunno, I was a child, I had no idea. Again, I mean, the internet, and you guys, have made my small childhood dreams come true. So I just honestly, I can't thank you enough, and I look forward to giving you guys some coverage and if there's anything else that you would like to know, if you have any questions, leave those in the comments below. Everybody here is usually super supportive, and I love hearing from you guys, so thanks for being an incredible community, I love you. Hashtag, IJ... I don't, what's my hashtag? Do I have a hashtag? Team IJ? It used to be IJ Army, should we stick with that? I think we'll stick with that, peace out. There's a new Guayaje flavor. It's sparkling blackberry mint. Color me freaking impressed. I'll see you guys in Cupertino. (chill electronic music)",

    "transcript": "- [Lois] Peter, we're gonna be late for my cousin's wedding. Aren't you dressed yet? - [Peter] Oh crap. Well, one of us is gonna have to change. - Some things are just facts. It is a terrible time to be a Bulls fan, England is a beautiful city, and I am an iPhone user. And I realize I am probably putting a giant target on my back by saying that, but honestly, I'm kinda tired of having to be politically correct, especially when it comes to smartphones. You use what you use. You like what you like. For me, that happens to be an iPhone, but because of that, I feel like it's kinda given me the chance to sit back and watch the OnePlus 5 launch from a different perspective. There was so much hype going into the launch, maybe too much for their own good, and once the phone dropped, it got crapped all over, and maybe some of that was unwarranted. So what I wanna do is kinda break down the five biggest complaints I've seen surrounding the OnePlus 5 and also hopefully, shed some light on those complaints, as well. And hands down, the number one comment I've seen is that it looks very, very similar to the iPhone 7 Plus. So being an iPhone user and specifically, an iPhone 7 Plus user, yes, there are no doubt similarities between these two, and honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if someone mistake the OnePlus 5 for an iPhone 7 Plus in the wild, but surprisingly, I actually prefer the feel of the OnePlus 5 in my hand over the iPhone 7 Plus. The iPhone 7 Plus has always felt a little slippery and a little bulky. If you wear it in shorts, forget about it. And with the OnePlus 5 being lighter and thinner, I actually think it is a better in-hand experience overall. So next up on number two, one of the biggest complaints I've seen is that the OnePlus 5 camera sucks. And honestly, it's not so much that the camera sucks. It's more so that it's just not better than the best out right now. I think OnePlus really needed to hit a home run with this, and had they done that, I don't think they would've been beaten up as badly as they have been. The Google Pixel is a great example. It is a flagship phone at a flagship price that is clearly missing a ton of high-end features, but because of the pure android experience and because the camera was so good, it was pretty well received. As far as dual cameras on the OnePlus 5 go, I think portrait mode works well. It's not better than the iPhone 7 Plus, but I think really the bigger complaint I've seen is the fact that they wish OnePlus 5 would've went with a wide angle lens instead of a telephoto lens as the second option. Coming from an iPhone 7 Plus user where I'm kind of in the same boat with that second lens being a telephoto option, I tend to agree, LG kinda nailed it with their dual camera system. The wide angle is much, much more useful. So with that, I kinda wish OnePlus would've gone that route, as well. Now jumping from pictures to video, one of the things I noticed right away was the lack of OIS, and yes, there a software version of that, but it is nowhere near as good as the real deal, and I think using an iPhone 7 Plus for so long, that has gotta be one of my favorite features, how well that video stabilization works. So from a camera package as a whole, I can kind see why OnePlus got a little beat up for that. Next up on number three, the biggest complaint I've seen is that it is only a 1080p display. Where, OnePlus, is my 1440p display, and where is my super tall 18:9 aspect ratio? So yeah, I totally see that point, but I also don't see it as the biggest deal in the world. Yes, the Galaxy S8 does a 1440p display, but it also shifts in a 1080p mode out of the box for better performance. The iPhone 7 Plus has a 1080p display, which I think looks fantastic, and yeah, you do lose out on that extra tall 18:9 aspect ratio screen like on the LG G6 or technically, the 18 1/2:9 aspect ration in the Galaxy S8, but those phones cost considerably more than the OnePlus 5. Now next up on number five, one of the biggest complaints I've seen is that the OnePlus 5 has no water resistance, and again, kinda jumping back to the camera, if they had done a better job with that, I don't think the water resistance would've been as big of a deal. Again, like I mentioned, the Google Pixel was not water resistant, but because the camera was so good, because the experience was so good, it kinda got a pass for that. Could they have included water resistance with the OnePlus 5? Absolutely, but that kinda ties into the fifth and final complaint I've seen about this phone, and that is the fact that it is simply too expensive now. Now, from that standpoint, that is where I kinda disagree with everything. The OnePlus 5 starts at $479. You compare that to the iPhone 7 Plus, the Galaxy S8 Plus, the Google Pixel, those are all $700 plus. The iPhone 7 Plus, which is $770, only has 32 gigabytes of storage. Same thing with the Google Pixel XL. We can talk specs and benchmarks or cheating benchmarks all day, but at the end of it, what really matters, I think the best thing about the OnePlus 5 is OxygenOS. It is clean. It is very similar to a pure Google experience but also very useful at the same time. You have USBC, super fast storage inside the phone, and hand down, one of the coolest features with the OnePlus 5 is their Dash Charge technology, which is lightening quick. The unfortunate thing with OnePlus is I kinda look at them as that person in a relationship who tried so, so hard at the beginning to go above and beyond, meet these crazy expectations, but over the long term, just couldn't simply keep that up. The problem though is that second person in the relationship or I this case, the consumer and the tech audience becomes a little bit jaded and maybe a little less appreciative of the efforts now. Ultimately, the way I look at the OnePlus 5 is kinda like a la carte cable. If there are channels and features you don't want, you leave them off and ultimately save money. In this case, if you don't need water resistance, if you don't need a 1440p display, if you don't need an extra tall 18:9 aspect ratio, then maybe you wanna consider the OnePlus 5. On the other hand, maybe you want those features, maybe you really want that better camera. Then I would step up to the Galaxy S8, the LG G6, the iPhone 7 Plus, but maybe those features aren't worth it to you and you wanna save $300, the OnePlus 5 is not bad at all.",

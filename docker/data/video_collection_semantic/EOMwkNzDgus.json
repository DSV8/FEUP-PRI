    "transcript": "today I'm doing something I've not done in a while hosting a pre-built versus custom Deathmatch Arena of death 2022 style and the whole video is sponsored by be quiet that sent over some be quiet things for the video and who knows maybe by the end of the video we'll be giving away the Victorious system Maybe [Music] thank you foreign for this comparison I'm going to be using the MSI ages system I did a video on recently which cost me about 8 400 Canadian dollars but aside from a case that would have been considered archaic 15 years ago the system gave me a less virulent form of typhoid than I was expecting but now that the skull apocalypse is mostly over can we build a better custom system for the same amount now depending on your outlook on life one of the main advantages or disadvantages of a custom system is that you have to build it yourself I really enjoy building PCS but I've heard that there are these weird lizard people that don't necessarily enjoy building PCS and if you're one of those then maybe just taking a system out of a box is a huge Advantage towards the Preble and if you're one of those nerds that doesn't enjoy building your own gaming PC hopefully by the end of this video you'll see it for the borderline erotic process that it is so now that I've potentially offended some of you which you deserve by the way let's get started with the build that out the way now we're going to start off by pre-assembling the system on this box to make sure that all of the components work before we build it into a case now I personally don't normally do this because I'm a bit of a badass but for a video like this I think it's a good example of best practice [Music] wow by modern motherboard standards that is a surprisingly nude board a lot of modern motherboards are just covered in aluminum at this point but it was on a good sale so uh yeah I think this Pro z690p should do the job [Music] now in terms of CPU we got this theek I5 12 600 KF it was on hello sales so I just couldn't not get it and this is a decent step up from the I5 12 400 that's in the MSI system we even get some efficiency cores oh nice [Music] a CPU socketed next we're going to install the SSD which is a 500 gig nvme WD blue drive it's the same size as the one in the MSI pre-build [Music] uh m.2 drives are like my favorite thing ever and just like that are blazing fast storage is installed it's like magic in terms of ram I'm using the 16 gig team group kit which again was just too good value to pass up and this is a 3200 megahertz kit not the fastest but it makes up for it with excellent pillow talk next is the first hashtag sponsored by be quiet part for the video the pure rock 2 FX now for this build you can definitely get away with a cheaper cooler but then you wouldn't have your be quiet RGB EP so what choice do you really have [Music] thank you now the thing that makes the purok 2 FX FX is the inclusion of this high quality lightwing fan in terms of GPU I'm using this MSI RTX 3060 Ventus 3x now the MSI pre-built also has an RTX 3060 in it but it's got a Ventus 2x which has a much smaller cooler and it's a much smaller cooler that's stuffed into a case with significantly less airflow so this card will likely have a much more temperate life but it's still the same GPU right so the performance Delta is not going to be that massive [Music] power supply wise be quiet sent over this awesome pure power 11 which is a 600 watt 80 plus gold rated semi-modular power supply and this is a decent upgrade over that riffraff power supply in the NSI premium [Music] oh my favorite thing about be quiet power supplies is the 12 pin pcie power connector on the power supply side that 12 pin really gets my juices flowing every time so now we're going to jump start our system all we need for it is to just post so we don't have to plug it into a monitor okay okay that's good it's gotten past VGA and it's on boot now which it makes sense for it to be stuck on boot because well there's no boot media in it okay so I guess now we can drop this in a case and then we can compare pre-built versus custom for the case be quiet sent over the purebase 500dx I really like this case but it's a bit expensive for this price point but it's an amazing case so you get what you pay for as you can see there is some contrast between black and white with this 500dx which means I think it's going to match quite well with the pretty much all black interior components we're gonna drop in here [Music] features like this power supply ezo Mount are amazing [Music] now I've run into a slight problem with the RGB which I'm pretty sure there's a law of physics that dictates if you're gonna use RGB in a system you have to struggle for it but for some reason the only RGB header on this motherboard is all the way down here which is a bit of an odd place to put it but it's fine at least it has the header although the problem is that the RGB connector on this fan isn't long enough to reach it it just gets to like right next to it basically I just went and found like a little adapter prong cable thing which should solve the problem [Music] foreign [Music] building a custom system is a lot more effort than just taking a PC out of the box but look at what you're rewarded with the effort put into building the system makes it all the more unique and all the more yours and aside from that we have much higher quality components for the same price and in my opinion a much better looking system but with that let's do some gaming on these two systems and see how they stack up there let's start with this one so after about 20 minutes of gaming on the little MSI pre-built you can see that the graphics card is sitting at 82 degrees Celsius which is just on the border of where Nvidia gpus starts slowing themselves down 83 degrees Celsius the CPU on the other hand is doing a bit better mid 70s isn't the worst although the ambient temperature in here is about 17 degrees Celsius so those temperatures will climb in a hotter climate yeah not not the best temperature performance and noise wise I got a reading of about 49 DB but let's see how our be quiet system compares hey that is a lot better both the graphics card and the CPU are running cooler the graphics card has a slightly higher sustained core frequency and you know it isn't really a secret bigger heatsinks and more ventilation lead to better temperatures but what about the noise now better temperatures and lower noise is all well and good but did it actually give us any more gaming performance [Music] wow aside from the one percent lows those results are very much within the margin of error which makes sense they have the same graphics card in all fairness the custom system was not built Min maxing performance per dollar be quiet it's a pretty premium brand so I couldn't cheap out on the case for example which meant I did have to sacrifice some gaming performance and that is one of the beauties of a custom system you can match the configuration to what you want to do but that customizability quality and value comes at the cost of convenience and approachability so with that let me know in the comment section down below which one you think was the winner either way we are going to be giving away this be quiet system but first I want to Spruce it up a little foreign lightwing RGB fans just to give it a bit more EP in value you know and then I also went out and got this Wi-Fi card because I think there's like a law against giving people a PC that doesn't have Wi-Fi in it and the motherboard in it doesn't come with Wi-Fi and I also got some sleeved cables just to make it look a bit fancier you know so let's drop these in the system and then I'll talk you through how the giveaway is going to work everybody knows sleeved cable extensions bring all the boys to the yard [Music] now if you want to win this beautiful system Hyun of be quiet there will be a gleam Link in the description below everybody gets one entry you just click a thing and it happens I think the giveaway is global as long as things can be shipped to you entries will be open from the moment this video goes live to exactly a week from now also be quiet sent over all of the be quiet stuff I paid for the rest of the system although this is a sponsored video thank you be quiet you're awesome and I think that is all of the legal disclaimers I need to make for the giveaway so thank you for watching and until the next video bye [Music]

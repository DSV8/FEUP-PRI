    "transcript": "- How rugged is the Dell Rugged Extreme. Well it's, pretty freaking rugged I think. This thing, is one heck of a good laptop, I think. And I really hope it's fine. Dell Rugged Extreme. Yeah. (laughs) You can see where the shovel hit it. She's fine. She's fine. Oh, I need to take off my sweater. Ittstore.com. This is the Dell Latitude 7330 Rugged Extreme. And it is one beast of a laptop. If there's a laptop that you want to take, I don't know into the middle of the desert to Antarctica kind of anywhere, that's just very bad for laptops. This is the laptop you want. Let's have a little look. Where's the IO? Do you see the IO Andy? - [Andy] Hidden - Yeah. This thing is waterproof. So in order to get to the IO, you have to push down there and then it's behind this little waterproof door. Holy Frigg. There's been such a trend towards less and less IO on laptops. So we've got two USB type A's, Thunderbolt, HDMI, and is that serial port? We also have ethernet another USB type A, another Thunderbolt, mini SD card reader, and a SIM slot over here. And this I believe is a smart card reader. Now you would use that for like authentication. Say that you're somewhere that has very high security. Someone would need their own special physical card to put in here in order to unlock the laptop. Oh, pen. Cool. This thing is latched like proper latched. You have to push down right here in order to get it open. What a beast. Just look at it. Hmm. Hmm. Okay. Maybe, maybe starting the video with hitting with a shovel wasn't the best idea ever, but it's it's it's fine. It's fine. There we go. It it's totally fine. It loved it. So in here we have our charger. It is 90 Watts over USB type C. Lovely. Can, can you even open this thing up without just like a couple things like that? I don't think you should. Oh, it's a touchscreen. Just found that out. Okay. First thing here, this screen is wicked. Watch this. - [Andy] Aww, the camera clipping. - Is is, is your camera clipping Andy. Excellent. 1400 Nits from this panel and what the MacBook says 1600? They're liars. This one's actually 1400. This is Apple's 1600 Nit display. And this is Dell's actually 1400 Nits display. How, how does that look on your camera there Andy? - [Andy] Let's pull out the waveform. Yeah. That's brighter. The Dell is brighter. - Yeah. The Dell's way brighter. Like you can just see it with your eyeballs super easily. One thing I am noticing is that this this track pad really sucks. There's a good reason for it though. Do we have some gloves around here? Yeah. Compared to something like the Dell XPS 15 this track pad right here. Fantastic. Love to use it. This one is not, not at the best. It's kind of weird, but if you look here now it doesn't work at all. I, I have some gloves on and the track pad on the XPS 15 is completely useless. Whereas on the Rugged Extreme, it works just as well as before. I wouldn't say it works great, but it works just as well as before. The touchscreen work too? Oh, beautiful. And touchscreen around. Yeah. The touchscreen's supposed to work with gloves on just confirm, not working too great on the rugged though. It's it's yeah, that doesn't work too great. The track pad works well though. Okay. Okay. For the processor in here we have the Intel i7-1185G7. Now compared to a 12th gen counterpart of this it is gonna be a lot slower. This has four cores, eight threads that said on a machine that's purposes, more like doing that. I'm a lot less concerned about which generation they have and more so they're just gonna be focused on it works. They know 11th gen works. It's been out for over a year. They don't have to worry about weird driver issues and crap like that ruining your day. This thing up times, way more important than just having a couple extra cores. Memory we have 16 gigabytes at 4267 mega transfer per second. That's weird, but whatever. Sure. Also a 500 gigabyte SSD from Samsung probably a pretty fast one then. Wifi 6E, wicked and Iris XE graphics which are working pretty hard at the moment actually to screen record this. Ugh. The crab rave doesn't sound quite right. Like what's up Andy? Yeah, no. Yeah. It's actually a segue to our sponsor XSplit. Thanks to XSplit for sponsoring this video XSplit is a trusted live streaming and recording software designed for gaming, presentations, and live events.

I would not say it's pleasant in any way. Yeah. That's better. Well yeah, those speakers are bad, but very loud. What can it do? Oh, it's sears your eyeballs. Well the screen doesn't look great. It hurts your ears, but doesn't sound very good. And you can paddle someone with it. Yeah. You could like, I don't know be oh. Or you can just accidentally spill a bunch of water on it while you're drinking from your water bottle and you can't do that with most laptops. Okay. There we go. Okay. Aside from being waterproof the keyboard actually isn't all that bad. You do need a little bit more force than most laptops require. There's keeps a travel kind of mushy, but at the same time like once you get used to it you're gonna be able to type super fast on this thing. I guess another thing that you completely do not have to worry about is deck flex. Like a lot of laptops. Like I'm really given it right now. Like this that's a lot of weight and this thing is just not flexing at all. Yeah. I'll break the desk before I break this thing. Oh freak. Oh yeah. Dell Rugged Extreme so much better for gloves. Even though it does have a little bit more force required to do the actuation. It makes it so much easier to not mistype when you have a glove. With the XPS 15 like the whole finger was just hitting like three keys at a time. This one right here, it's difficult and you have to henpeck it. But at the same time you can. Okay. Okay. It it's doing it. It's doing it. It's playing Valheim at 720P at what feels kind of like almost 60 FPS. Occasionally less than that, this, this is not too bad. This screen, the contrast ratio is not very great. Like compared to an OLED or something. The block levels are not fantastic but I don't think it's supposed to be so whatever. But do you know what this can do that no other gaming laptop is able to so we're running, you know, we're running, not plugged in. You can just remove the battery and just keep on going. Totally fine. There's two of them and they're hot swappable. So I think between these each one's 53.5 watt hours. So if you had this much capacity and a single battery you wouldn't be allowed on a plane but because two of them, it's fine. And also since it's hot swappable, if you're, you know, out in the field, you can just have a couple of these batteries and be like, okay, hey, battery's almost dead. Boom, take her out. Then put the other one in batteries full again. Beautiful. All right's a couple more thing before we open her up the webcam, it has a physical shutter. So if you look here, there we go. Now you can see it. Now you can't. All right. How is this webcam? First of all, we lost the footage from the first one. So that's why it looked different. But anyway, this looks, it almost looks like there's like a facial smoothing feature. I think it's just a very soft webcam, but at the same time like I look so smooth right now the exposure is working quite well. Like it is exposing properly for my face. And if I like move away it's yeah it seems like it's totally fine. Let's move it over here a little bit. Yep. It's doing a great job. Good job, Dell. You didn't totally screw this one up also a fingerprint reader right over here. If you want to get in without, you know, dealing with passwords and stuff, should we take it apart? Now the rugged extreme is one of the most repairable laptops on the market. It is just fricking great. So first of all, battery replacement we already showed that, but you know, boom. There's one out. There's two out. Takes a matter of seconds. Can you even just check it? Oh cool. You can also just check the battery life when you don't even have plugged in. For storage there's a single screw right here. Let's take that out and then yep. Yep. Nice and easy. There's our SSD. Very easy to replace. I haven't taken one of these apart for a while so I kind of forget what you have to do. Let's just start removing screws and see what happens. Oh, one thing that's really cool before we open it all the way up. See all these pads right here. Those are contacts so that you can connect it to like a big old frame. So it mounts in like a police car or an ambulance or something like that. Now that's why the outer shell of this is essentially the same as the last model because you know, no one's going to upgrade, if they have to change out their mounts and accessories and stuff at the same time. So this right here, complete drop in replacement. Ah, we have a lot of screws. You can tell how a rugged is by that's all that happened when I hit it with a shovel. Oh we did it. I think so. Oh, it was only 31 screws. Yay. One thing that's really cool about this laptop is that the IO I believe can be swapped. How would you do that? Okay. The IO, I believe can be swapped but we're not going to screw with that. Cuz it looks like half a time. Also like look at how many in is, is this for wifi? What the? This probably is partially to do with there being a SIM card. But look at the fricking antennas on this thing. There's what 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 antennas. Inside of it. They're snaking all over the place. This thing must get incredible reception. Okay. Oh, so this one's GPS, I guess. This one's land. Okay. There's also another PCI U slot right here. So I guess you could use that for storage, but oh yeah. There's another couple antennas right here. So that's almost definitely if you want to have an internal SIM card one thing you might have been wondering though this thing is waterproof but it doesn't immediately overheat. How do they get the heat out while not letting water in it's it's actually really cool. So the CPU is under here. Then the heat pipes come out and around and then there's a gasket right there. And gasket goes all the way around actually. And that allows you to have it so that this fan spins the air goes out here and I guess water can get in but, whatever who cares. You just do water, cooling your laptop. And then water isn't able to get into the rest of the chassis and screw around with your components. One thing that's kind of disappointing is that I can't seem to find where you would upgrade the RAM. It might just be soldered down which is a little bit disappointing, especially given that like how many laptops are you able to swap the IO on? But you can't swap the RAM. It seems like a little bit of an oversight but I'll I'll allow it. The price is something else for this guy. How we have it here. It's what $4,100? Starts at $4,300 and goes up from there. You're paying for, I guess this magnesium and this gasket and all of the testing that they have done. Editor please put a testing video, up right here. It's it's hilarious. It's some of the funniest stuff that I've ever seen not covered by warranty though. They, they did mention that. But yeah, if you're just a regular person I don't think you're gonna buy one of these. If you're a paramedic or working in an oil field or I don't know, going and you need something to be able to whack a polar bear in the head with this is laptop that you want. So huge thanks to Dell for giving us this weapon and huge thanks for watching this video. Hit like, get subscribed and just have a great day.",

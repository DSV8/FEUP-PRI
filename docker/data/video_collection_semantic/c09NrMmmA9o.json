We decided to take a look at this trend and benchmark identical single vs dual channel setups in a thin and light gaming notebook.

    "transcript": "okay so I do want to start this video with an apology with regards to my recent review on the gigabyte arrow 15X gaming laptop if you're actually interested in checking it out link will be right over here but there's something that I've really missed on that review that some of you did bring up in the comments and that is the memory configuration which I'll get to in a bit now just to quickly go over the specs of this laptop it features an RTX 2070 max-q GPU an Intel Core i7 8th generation processor and it has a really fast and me me and 16 and 16 gigabytes of memory clocked at 2666 megahertz the catch is it's running in single channel mode so it's a single 16gb dimm that's populated in that one slot it comes with two slots but one of them is unpopulated so that actually got me thinking as to would dual channel mode really bang bring a huge performance boost on notebooks because we've known or we've seen that with desktops there is a difference of running you know system with single channel memory and of course dual channel memory but I really wanted to test out and see if it would apply to no but which it technically should but I really wanted to say for myself so I decided to do just that and the results are really eye-opening so let's get into it but first a quick message from our sponsor the new Razer Blade 15 is a machine for people who know exactly what they want when you need a reliable keyboard and one custom lighting when you need an accurate display and what's insanely fast 144 Hertz refresh rate when you need a portable machine and want a gorgeous thin aluminum unibody in the world's smallest 15.6 inch gaming laptop when you need powerful gaming hardware to truly dominate with GeForce rtx the Razer Blade 15 when you need the power for anything you do and want nothing to hold you back check out the configuration you want down below alright so to make things fair I want to make sure to run these comparisons with you know the same clock speeds as well as timings because that's important too so the one that comes with the air 15X is a Samsung module that's running at 20 666 megahertz with timings of 19 19 19 and 43 and again it's a single you know 16gb module so I had to obviously do a little bit of digging in the office to find the exact same capacity except running in dual channel sticks running at the clock speed and the same timings and luckily I found this it's a ram axle 16 gigabyte kit that i popped out of the Lenovo Legion Y740 gaming laptop and it also happens to run at the same clock speed which is 2666 megahertz and the same timings as a Samsung memory that's coming out of the air 15X with that out of the way all I did was basically rerun the benchmarks that is three times on every single game and I took an average of that and I also did some video rendering test to see if it actually makes a difference and why don't we take a look at it and as you can see there is a significant improvement in terms of game performance so with overwatch we're getting about seven percent increase you know from 140 frames per second to 150 frames per second apex legends didn't really yield that much of increase but I think that's more of an game optimization thing but what battlefield one the increase was against massive I mean we went from around 80 frames per second to just a tad below 110 frames per second which is just amazing then we have doom running at 1080p set to the Vulcan API and we got roughly 20% increase in terms of frame rates and then lastly we have metro Exodus running in 1080p high and as you can see the performance boost is just massive finally I did want to run some rendering tests so I did take this 12-minute 4k project and I exported it to the U to 4k preset using Adobe Media encoder and the results are just amazing I mean you are really saving some time while 2 minutes is not that significant it you know when you do longer projects when your rendering longer projects on a notebook it really does add up and I think it's important especially when you're thinking about configuring gaming laptop or just to not look in general to make sure that it comes in dual channel mode so the takeaway from this video is pretty simple first of all I completely missed out on that single channel configuration on my Ruby videos so again I do want to take this time to apologize for that but it also it brings up a really good point with regards to how brands tend to offer their gaming laptops in different configurations and the one thing that you really have to pay close attention to is whether or not if they're providing it in single channel mode or dual channel mode some brands don't do it I mean especially when I looked at the Phoenix's website they just don't even mention as to whether or not if their notebooks are running in single or dual channel mode the same story goes with Asus but when you look at companies like Dell Lenovo or even Razer they do mention that the RAM capacity or the RAM configurations that are running in dual channel mode so I really want to hope I hope that brands actually takes something away from this video and that is to be more transparent with regards to the configuration on their notebook and if you're actually looking to spend anywhere between a thousand to three thousand dollars on a notebook you want to make sure they're getting the best out of the money and single channel memory can definitely cripple the performance of your notebooks so I would highly recommend doing your research and of course making sure that you are getting the best out of what you're paying so that's it for me guys thank you so much for watching make sure to check out some relevant content over here subscribe to our boot sequence channel I'm signing off and I'll see you guys in the next one",

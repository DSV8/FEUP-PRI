    "transcript": "*intro music* What's up guys? Lew here back with another video. This is the third in the installment of amazing and cool virtual reality unboxing videos. where you and me, together in VR We take a trip down memory lane and we look at some of the most important gadgets in general as well as in my personal life,and this one takes the cake, this is the original Nintendo Otherwise known as the NES, Nintendo Entertainment System. This thing was an absolute game changer it's the first console I had It might be the first one that you had as well. It brought a controller into peoples living room,and completely changed our perspective on what gaming was going to be. as you can see I've got a pristine action set in front of me. Back of the box You can see what it's all about. here's the happy family would they be happy if it weren't for the nintendo? I can't say I can neither confirm nor deny, but I do want to say something about this scene right here you see this family over here, alright that was me that was my family right there, because back then what this represented was local gaming,local multiplayer, there's a reason two controllers are inside the box you're supposed to do it with someone else and so when I open this up on Christmas morning it was sort of about the console maybe more importantly looking back now it was about the promise it was about those hours that we're going to be spent together myself my brother i mean that even that even in kind of looks like a young version of me right there maybe in some alternate universe I'm the kid in this commercial wo what are we doing here let's get inside the box enough of all that and take a closer look at what made up possibly the most important game console of all time so what will you notice here that the console on the left look at that though unbelievable condition. We got the game the zapper and two controllers let's start out with the game Jack bring it up right in this location for the people to enjoy and inspect of course a double game situation on one cartridge Super Mario Bros and Duck Hunt double your enjoyment nintendo 1985 also happens to be the year that i was born of course this didn't come out here in north america until later but it debuted in japan in 1985 now that's an interesting point because it brings me to the zapper now get rid of that game bring up the zapper in this location over here. its red right? orangish red kind of color the original one was actually completely gray the one that debuted in japan had to make a modification to satisfy the American audience so it turned into this orange Now I'm gonna pull the trigger right here i want you to prepare yourself brace yourself this moment is very important shh *click* you heard that spring unbelievable incredible experience if you've never pulled a Zapper trigger it's time probably to change your life change course get rid of the zapper bring up the controller over here what was so special about this i mean i'm looking at it now and so are you and you're going blue it looks like a box with buttons and yeah it kind of was ok but really it was the precursor for everything that was about to happen in the world of controllers and consoles in general it was no longer about joysticks and bringing those arcade cabinets into your house no you were leaning back then that's what the controller enabled it's got this long cable you lean back boom rapid-fire of course controllers have gotten a lot better now a lot more ergonomic but if it weren't for this controller I doubt would be where we are today and now the main attraction the NES itself look at that beauty right there two tone gray scrap everything on the screen here Jack bring it up let the people enjoy the spectacle of the original NES of course your AV in and out all standard definition but you didn't care you would have family on the back of the box right there and then on the front the door protecting your cartridge from the dust look at that now these buttons might be the most nostalgic component of this entire unboxing experience when I hit this power button I will be transported back to nineteen eighty-five here we go do this together with me........ yes....there you have it the classic possibly the most important gadget in my entire childhood I remember wanting this thing more than anything else and it happened one christmas and now i feel like it's Christmas all over again the NES 1985 hopefully you guys appreciate this series i know i enjoyed making it take a look around and appreciate all of these very cool 3d representations of all the items inside this box and i hope to continue this series with more retro gadgets so if there's something you'd like to see leave a comment down below Bye :)",

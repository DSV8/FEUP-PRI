    "transcript": "Welcome back. This is the Great Verge streaming draft of 2023, uh, which I'm saying so that it sounds like an annual thing, so that we require our themselves to do this every year. From now on, Nilay, hello and welcome to the draft. I've tried to pull that trick so many times. There's so many things we don't do every year that I've insisted that we're gonna do every year, but we're gonna do this every year. The first and only annual. Yeah, we're gonna do this every year. It's gonna be great. Alex Cranz. Hello. What happens if all of the streaming services die next? Just be super competitive. There's like a 60% chance that none of these things will exist a year from now. Okay. Um, we'll be picking Go 90 again. Yeah. Uh, it's gonna be great. The only thing on my list is Quibi, y'all. Let's be honest, I'm not gonna lie, the word Quibi appears in my notes somewhere in all the prep that I did for this, but we'll, we'll come to that later. Okay. So let me just quickly explain how this draft is gonna work and then we'll get into it. We're gonna do five round. And we're doing a snake draft. So the person who picks first, then they go second, then they go third, and the person who picks third then picks fourth. So we're, we're, we're going around and around, uh, I. We're gonna pick 15 total things over the course of this, and the idea is that whatever you pick is what you're stuck with for the next 12 months. Like the, imagine it, like you're drafting a team, right? This is your exclusive five streaming services for the next year. Uh, I will take any single subscription. As one draft pick. So you can draft the Disney bundle as one thing because that is one thing with one price. But also you can draft Disney Plus and ESPN Plus and Hulu as their own things because you can pay for them separately. That's the only one like that that I can actually think of. But if there are others, feel free and try to convince me otherwise. But what you can't do is the like Amazon channels, like subscribe to stars through here thing, cuz that's a separate thing that you pay for separately. So one bill one. One pick and do like adjacent services count. What do you mean? Things that are like streaming but maybe don't have their own content on them? Or a lot of their own content. Alex is like, I'm gonna pick YouTube. Can I pick YouTube? This, this sounds like a terrible pick, but Sure. If you wanna pick Plex is the answer to your question. If you wanna pick Plex, knock yourself out. That's an awful traffic pick. You can't pick Plex, you gotta pick, you gotta, Alex has to pick her own Plex surfer, right? Yeah. I pick my legs server. Yeah. That I will allow. Um, so, and as for what counts any, any streaming service counts, free, paid, whatever. It just has to be primarily, Entertainment. I'm gonna do my best to keep track of the cost of all these. And one fun wrinkle that I just came up with is whoever spends the least money in these five picks gets one extra free bonus pick at the end. Uh, yes. I don't know why. Just seems good. So yay for being cheap. Do you understand that the last pick of this draft is a punishment? It's not a reward. You get to have another streaming service. Instead of five streaming services, you get to have six. You can. I don't know. Quibi. I'm just punishment. Not a reward that Yeah, you're, you're not wrong. Um, if there are any disputes, Andrew, our producer, uh, is in charge. He, he rules and his word is final. He's the, he's the commissioner of our league. All right. Andrew is here to pick the draft order. Um, none of us know the draft order, cuz as far as I know there isn't one yet. Andrew, give it to me. Give it to me. I. Andrew, you're gonna tell us who's picking first, second, and third. What do you have for us? Me? Right? Okay. So Nilay responded to your message in Slack first today. So Nilay's gonna go first. Oh, what a surprise. Give the boss the first pick in the draft. What a shocking twist. Everybody's boss gets to go first, Mr. Commissioners. Terrible surprise. That's right. I'm the Dallas Cowboys baby. You can't run this league without me. Uh, and then Alex is gonna go second. Yes, and David is gonna go third cuz he's the host. This sucks. I don't wanna do this anymore. Fine, I bet I'm still gonna get my first pick at third, so this is fine. All right. Andrew, do you have another song for us? Yeah. Let's start the draft. Let's go time. This is a draft in a 9 0 2 1 oh episode. This is great. I've always wanted to drive a test and now I am. All right, Nilay Patel, you're on the clock. First pick. Wow. Zero hesitation. TikTok, explain. Wow. Uh, it, it provides the most value for the zeros of dollars. Uh, I have watched a lot of modern family on TikTok. It is the only streaming service that reliably produces videos of trucks trumping over things and in the rivers. That's very important to me. Uh, and. And I, I don't know if it's gonna get banned or not, but I want to be, I wanna be on the ride if that's gonna happen. Well, so that's the, this is like the most high risk, high reward pick ever. Right? Because there's a decent chance that literally it will not be available to you when we do this draft again in 12 months. Yeah. And you know what? Sometimes you gotta draft a quarterback who's definitely gonna get hurt. You know what I'm saying? Like, it, it, I just think about where do I spend the most? It's TikTok and there's, as we go through the draft, I think this, this choice will be rewarded. I might not need any other picks. Mm. Okay. So interesting. My reasoning for being anti TikTok as the first pick is that there's no. Like prestige, TikTok is like not a thing. And like what I want from one of my picks here, and maybe I'll get it later, but is the like sort of the, the like cultural relevancy of something where it's like everybody's very excited about the most recent episode of succession and you're gonna have to watch it in two minute increments. Well, I do have other. Right, like I can pick Alex's plex server. Uh, second, we have not, actually, this is a rules clarification. Am I still allowed to buy things? What do you mean? Oh, yes. You are allowed to buy things. Like I can rent movies. Yes. Okay, you can, you can go to Blockbuster and Redbox and rent as many DVDs as since I have to rent physical media, I can't rent it on iTunes. No. We'll, we'll, we'll leave like the Voodoos of the world separate. If you wanna pay four bucks to rent a movie, that's allowed. Okay. That exists. Outside of this, I'm ever more comfortable with this choice. Interesting. Okay. Alex, what do you think? Good choice, bad choice, terrible choice. Just why like, I watched all, I watched TikTok last night while I was watching succession, and that was a bad choice. That might be a proof of Mi Eli's point. I'm on cocaine. Like what? Yeah, basically, basically it was, it was a bad choice. So like, I'm trying to, to have less TikTok in my life, so I wouldn't wanna choose it as my first one. I see. That's fair. No, that's fair. Yeah. You gotta cut back. Very excited for the second pick in this draft. Yeah. Yeah. Alex, let's go second pick. What do you have? Oh, it's h b o max. Who? Okay. I'm coming out the gate strong. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm aggressive. I'm aggressive. All right. Defend, because succession, but also I watch a lot of stuff on, on H B O Max. It's, there's, there's a lot of good content on it, as long as it survives. So I've got this for like, what another. Maybe immediate theme in this draft of I need to ride this out while it lasts. Yeah. Uhhuh. So I'm gonna enjoy it for a month. I'm gonna watch, you know, maybe rewatch warrior rewatch, uh, sex Lives of College girls, whatever that show's called. That sounded really bad saying it out loud, but it's gonna be a great time. Okay. In the next month. Okay, here's, here's a philosophical question. Uh, are we, are we streaming services with ads people or spend the extra $5 for no ads? Oh, this is with the extra $5. I don't do it. Okay. So we're, we're spending the money to not get any ads. Yeah. Unlike Mil Eli who says, just give me every ad scroll right by every, every, don't worry about it. 30, 30 videos. Just there's your ad. You got a Magsafe charger. This is the best ad targeting you. Yeah. Let's be real. Nilay, are you an ads person? Do you pay for no ads? Oh, yeah. I, I pay for no ads everywhere. Okay. Which is funny because we run an ad supported website. Please don't skip over the ads on this podcast, but also pay for all of our paid things. Yeah. And those don't have ads. Maybe. I'm, I'm, I'm trying to bring these ideas together as much as I can. Verge plus, yeah. Coming. That's, that's the, that's my last pick. If I win this bonus pick, I'm picking that cuz it doesn't cost any money. Okay. Because it doesn't exist. You see, you see the logic here. Alex, what do you do with the fact that the H B O Max is app is like a horrible pile of garbage that doesn't work? 40 to 60% of the time, I just like close my eyes and think of the good content that I'll get to when I eventually find it. And the app works. You watch TikTok until the page loads. Yeah. And then yeah, just so, just avert my eyes and I press go and 30 minutes later maybe my show plays and I'm really. But in that, like, once that 30 minutes hit, then I've, I've got like, you get all those old movies cuz they have like the whole, they have all the, the Turner Classic stuff Yeah. Is on h b o max. So you, this is a strong pick because of the catalog For sure. Yeah. It's, it's all about the catalog for me. And the app is like just an unfortunate byproduct that I have to deal with. Also, whenever you want, you can watch a square version of Justice League. That's all I've, that's what I'm gonna do right after this, a three hour square. Second pick of the draft. Yeah. Hbo O X was gonna be my second pick specifically because it is like when you make a list of like relevant cultural shows that people care about, they are overwhelmingly on hbo. It's insane. Yeah. So by not having HBO O Max. Neely, you and I are just resigned to being sort of social outcasts. Don't worry. I got a plex server coming up. Alex is gonna rip everything from H B O max to her plex server. Problem solve. We never do that. That's wrong. Okay, so I'm up third. And for my third pick, I get my first pick, which is YouTube. This is the easiest decision of all time. I cannot believe neither of you picked YouTube. It's 2299 a month for YouTube premium, which is insane. And which I did not realize, I'd been paying all this time because they raised the price. Yeah. Uh, and which is, yeah, it's outrageous. That's like the family planets. Ridiculous. What do you get for that? So you get no ads. Okay. Which is great. You get background listening. Um, you get a music service for free, which is, Compelling. And now I don't have to pick Spotify or Apple Music or anything else because I just have YouTube music and all the music streaming services are the same. So it's, it's kinda like getting two picks in one, but also it's like YouTube over the last like 12 months for me has become the place I go when I don't know what I wanna watch and I just have like 15 minutes to kill. And I think part of this is, I just had a kid, so I, my windows of time to just sort of sit and do nothing Went from being like hours long Yeah. To like minutes long. Uh. But it, it's just, it's like highlights of soccer games that I missed because I have a small child and Hot Ones interviews is basically like my entire YouTube algorithm right now. And it's great. And I have, I have nothing against it, it feels like. It is the biggest one. It's also the only one of our three so far that will probably still exist 12 months from now. That's good. So I feel very good about that. I'm honestly shocked. Neither of you picked this. I felt like YouTube was like the obvious first choice. If I hadn't gotten TikTok, I would've gone YouTube premium. Good. All right. Well then I also get the fourth pick because of the way this draft works. Yes, Andrew, I've come around. I've decided you, you were right to give me the third pick. Thank you. Um, secret. So there's three I can choose from here. And I'm gonna, this is the, I'm gonna regret this choice, but I'm gonna make it, I'm gonna pick Peacock who? Ooh. Um, well, there goes, one of my picks would not have expected to do, but the honest truth is Peacock is where the office is and it's where Parks and Rec is. And for me, that is like 45% of my TV viewing between those two shows. And, uh, the, the other 45 exists on another service that I hope I get to pick later, but, Uh, it's just that like Peacock has some nifty stuff with live tv. They have some sports, they're starting to grow, but it is like fundamentally it is the place where the office is and I have to have the place where the office is. On my list. I already regret this choice as I'm saying this, I drafted this too. High Disclosure, pock is operated by NBC Universal, which is owned by Comcast, which is minority investor in Vox Media, parent company. David, I hope you got some sort of kickback for this miserable choice. I think this is a good choice. This is, this is like if you watch a lot of tv, peacock is a a very solid. Yeah, I think what we're we're gonna discover in this is that some of you watch vastly more television than I do. That's probably, that's probably true. Uh, but no, for me it's like I watch, I dabble in lots of TV and then I have like four shows that I cycle between over and over and over and over again. And two of them are the office and parks and Rec. Both of which are on Peacock, and I think I can reliably say both of which are never leaving Peacock because they are, yeah. Part of the company that owns Peacock. So I'm not afraid that six months from now they're just gonna suddenly disappear. Unlike on some other services that have gained and lost my shows until Peacock dies and they have to like sell to another company. There is that, but Peacock. Kind of, well, it went from being like a total disaster to like a kind of me success ish. Yeah. It's like, it's like trending in the right direction from really bad to kind of bad. It's like, you know, ina development, they go from like a cell to don't buy and they're like thrilled about it. Like that's peacock. Yeah. I just think you're gonna find yourself using the custom video player UI that they developed for no reason and you're like, this is my third pick. Like, that's just how that's gonna feel for you. Yeah. If the space bar on my iPad doesn't pause your video player, you've done it wrong and Peacock has done it wrong. Um, alright Alex, you're up. Um, I don't think this is gonna shock anybody but paramount plus, wow. That does not shock me. Yeah. Wow. The reaches in these rounds are out of control. I had that so much lower on my list because I get, I get Star Trek Love. A Star Trek. I get most of Yellowstone. The good, the good versions. Evil. That's lovely. The good fight. A bunch of like random cbs s stuff like ghosts and most importantly of all is 60 Minutes. So you're buying shows. Yeah, yeah. I'm, I'm all about the shows. Okay. For the most part. I got, I got some others here. But for the most part, it's about like the shows for me, but all like you, it's, it's like peacock where you get a bunch of live stuff too, so, so I can like watch live news if I need to. Yeah. That sort of thing. And then I gotta see what's gonna happen on Picard next week, like, I can't, I can't lose that. Yeah. I mean, I guess like saying you're buying shows, like at the end we're all just buying content. Yeah. Like no one's like, I'm buying this for a great ui. Like it's all content. But you very specifically are like these four shows. Yes. Oh, why I'm drafting this service. A hundred percent. Also, like the Peacock UI is fine. It's better than HBO O kind of in that, like the app loads from time to time. Yes. The app loads. Yeah. Like once you actually use it, it's miserable and I hate it, but otherwise it's. It does the job. So I will say, uh, when I first did my rankings, I had Paramount plus really, really, really low uhhuh. And then the Final four happened and the masters happened, and both of those things only streamed on Paramount Plus. And all of a sudden it's like, as a person who also likes to watch like Champions League soccer, like Paramount Plus has a sneaky amount of like really good, really high end sports that for me and like I actually don't subscribe to Paramount Plus. Uh, there were a couple of times the last couple of weeks I almost did, and I suspect I'm gonna end up having to do so. You'll, you, you'll like it, like kinda get it. Even though I don't care about Star Trek, like, to me, paramount Plus is just like, where do you go if you like Star Trek and there's lots of those people and I am not one of them. Yeah. And yeah, it's, it's, there's a bunch of other stuff. Like obviously the Star Trek is really big right now, at the moment for me. But for the most part it's all of the other content that I, I watch and now I can keep up with everybody in, in, at home who all watch Yellowstone and all of those shows so I can like, have conversations with my family. That's very. Love to be able to communicate. Here's the the rules question. Are you paying 9 99 a month for just Paramount or are you paying 1199 a month and also getting Showtime? Oh, 1199 a month. Oh, that's the easy, yeah, that's the easiest trade up of all time. That's just the price for Yellow Jackets. Right? You pay $2 a month to watch yellow jackets. Yeah, it's, that's the yellow jacket's price. Yeah. A hundred percent. Yeah. That's how they make billions. Yeah. Yeah. So, sorry. So smooth. That just came out so smooth. Okay, so you take Paramount Plus and Showtime for 1199. I actually think that was a pretty good pick. Uh, Eli, you're up. What do you got? Oh, this is hard. I can go two ways. Well, okay. And you're gonna get a pick, and then we're gonna take a break, and then you're gonna get another pick. So plan this out as you go. Oh, yeah. No, no. That's actually super easy then. Disney plus. Okay. Why, uh, child? Yes. Uh, you have a child. Child, bluey. I'm, I'm, I'm drafting bluey. This is the Bluey pick. Yeah. Very specifically Bluey, uh, frozen Moana. Like this stuff just flows through the house like water also. Um, it, it is like the single app on her iPad that I trust. Hmm. In like, in any way, shape or form. Uh, like YouTube Kids is just a disaster clown car of a situation. Yes. Uh, she loves it. Um, but you've taken it off the board, which is really interesting. Right, cuz you took YouTube totally off the board. So YouTube kids went for the ride. Right? So you gotta, the kid pick has to be d plus. Okay. So and also, well I was, I have two follow up questions. One is, are you just taking Disney Plus or are you taking the bundle and also getting Hulu and. Uh, ESPN plus it's more expensive, but you get more stuff. Oh, just went, I'm taking the bundle. Okay. Uh, Hulu's fine. Uh, my que Actually, my question was, if I take the bundle, you can still pick Hulu, right? That's right. Okay. So yeah, I'm taking the bundle. Not totally strategic. If I was taking it totally off the board, zero. Like, that's just draft strategy, right? Sure. Um, uh, but there's, yeah, Hulu has a reasonably good catalog. It's got some movies on there. The real thing I'm taking is ESPN Plus, which has the one show I watched during football season more consistently than anything else. NFL primetime, which is great. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah, you're the, the, you two are the two people I know that are like ESPN plus. It's. Yeah, it just for one show. Do you wanna watch college softball on a Saturday afternoon? Like they got you 4 99 a month. Let's go. Uh, also, you just made an interesting point, which is, uh, you sound like a person who would be against doing what everybody thinks is gonna happen, which is that Disney just pulls all of the Hulu stuff into Disney Plus because it's a better, more successful app anyway. But it sounds like in the, like it's the one app I trust on the iPad fame. Maybe you don't want that to. Like, do you want all the Hulu stuff baked in there? I, we can age gate it already. Okay. So like she's already got the kids version of D plus, which is like, there, there's a lot of age gates built into it. Like they know that their audience is kids. So I'm not worried about the catalog and the app expanding cuz I think that Disney of all companies will be good at, at knowing that my daughter is five, you know? Um, and not like it's, it's actually hard for her to get some movies, like some Pixar movies are rated PG and she can't get them in her version. D plus, like we have to use my account. Uh, so I'm not so worried about that. I do think, like the reason I was like, whatever on Hulu is like Hulu will go away before TikTok goes away. Yeah. Oh really? Right. Like yeah. Or it will outlast us all. Those are the only two outcomes. It's Season 60. One of the Handmaid's Tale coming soon. Exactly. Um, but like every one of its corporate owners has tried to kill. And it has survived. It has outlasted all of them, but I, I think in this particular round of the streaming wars, like neither Disney nor Comcaster League wants it to exist, and I, it just, it just seems like the, if you're taking it, you should take it part as part of this bundle, but it's a, a, it's a risky early round pick. Alex, what do you think? This would've been my next pick. So I'm, I'm very on board for this. Alex, what do you think? I mean, I assumed one of you with children was gonna pick it, so I was just waiting for one of you with children to pick it. Like that just tracked for me. I was like, I, I don't need a lot of this stuff on there. I'm fine. I, it does kind of feel like if you don't have kids or care about Marvel and Star Wars, Disney Plus is actually like mostly useless to you. But if either of those things apply to you, it is like the most important thing in the. Yeah, it's like I can just go see those movies when they come out and like the TV shows have all been fine. I'll survive. Yeah. Yeah. There's, there's a no way, like, people should know that if I could draft Disney Plus without drafting Star Wars, I would do it. If I could just leave that on the table, it would be fine. Uh, this is very much the Bluey draft pick, and if you have a child, you know how important this. That's fair. I like it. Um, alright, so we're through two rounds. We should take a break and then we're gonna do the rest. Uh, let me just recap the first two rounds. So after two rounds, NII has picked TikTok and the Disney bundle, which is Disney plus, Hulu and ESPN plus. Alex has HBO O Max and Paramount plus slash Showtime and I have YouTube and Peacock. I feel like I'm losing so far. I would say, uh, I also just wanna say David only eats ramen. Like, David, you've very broke ass. I was so thrown off by not getting the first pick. You guys like, it's, it's bad. It's going bad for me. Uh, but I'm gonna, I'm gonna come back strong from the break. Uh, I also just wanna say we are six picks in and no one has picked Netflix and that's kind of wild. Yeah. Uh, but I suspect that's coming up soon. Let's take a quick break and then we'll get back into it. We'll be right back. All right, we're back round three streaming draft. Andrew, do you have any more music for us? It's the verges streaming draft. Come at you live from New York City, the pro brought you by monster in exactly who's gonna win it all this year@theverge.com. All right, Eli, round three. It's me. Kick us off because I have the next pick. Uh, all right. This is a one. It's, this is my reach and I'm definitely just blowing the cost curve there. There's no way I'm getting the last pick. Oh, I know what you're picking. There's only one of two things that that applies to. I'm, I'm just gonna do it. I'm just gonna buy Quibi. Um, uh, that doesn't blow your cost structure. I don't think that's true. That's pretty cheap. Uh, YouTube TV was Sunday ticket. Oh. Which is Infinity dollars. Right. It's like 80 bucks a month plus like $300 to for Sunday ticket in rent zone. Yeah. Per month or just overall? Just the season. It's 72 99 a month right now for just YouTube TV because the price goes up like every three to four days. Uh, and yeah. And Sunday ticket, they just announced yesterday. As this goes live, uh, the price for Sunday ticket is gonna be $289 in a presale and 3 89 if you buy it during season. Are you sure you're, you're sure about this? Yeah, I mean, they got me. What, what am I gonna do? I mean, I will say, uh, Alex brought up Yellowstone Uhhuh. I watched all of Yellowstone on our YouTube tv. Ye because Paramount channel's in there. So you can just like DV art and skip the ads. Uh, it is an election year. I feel like I'm gonna watch, end up watching a lot of cnn. I appear on cnbc. Sometimes my wife likes to watch me on television. Like I can concoct argue. It's like mostly nonsensical arguments, right? Yeah. Um, but I can concoct arguments for the value of, of live cable television. It, but if not for Sunday ticket, I would not, I would not be drafting this high it's Sunday ticket that I'm. Yeah, it's, yeah, it's, it's football. Like that's, for me, it's red zone, just the, the like that's the only way I watch football anymore and there's a lot of money I would pay and do pay every year to do it, but I can do it through YouTube. Yeah, right. You can, you can buy the Red Zone channel through YouTube. Right. You already have it. Right. Again, I'm off the cost cover. It doesn't even matter, but I'm buying the version that comes with Red Zone cuz there's a cheaper one that doesn't. Yeah, you really did just kind of give yourself an insur amount. Lead in the spending a lot of money. $73 a month. And that's not including Sunday ticket. All right. All the rest of mine are gonna be free. Free V baby. Let's do this thing. Uh, why is the YouTube TV over like Hulu with live TV or any of those other ones just purely it's, it's football. Yeah. I, I can't imagine why I would pay for, for not the one without football. I think that's a YouTube's calculation here. I was gonna say, I feel like you just explained why YouTube spent all this money on. Yeah. Uh, also, I mean, I've, I've used other ones. They're fine. I think the YouTube TV interface is better. It doesn't matter. Yeah. Like, um, but yeah, it's football. I'm buying football. Alex, did you have live TV on your list at all? Kind of. I feel like if you don't care about sports, why would you? Yeah, like, I mean, I've got Paramount plus I've got another pick potentially. But yeah, I don't really care about sports, so I don't really care about most live tv like y'all enjoy that. So the, the $75 a month for live tv. Blowing your mind? No. Okay. Like, just pirate it. Okay. I mean, I can just watch it. It's just pirate. Over the air. Over the air. Haven't drafted your plex server yet. Don't forget it's still out there. Uh, all right, well then let's move on. What's your next pick? Ooh. Okay. This one's a toughie. I'm gonna do something really, speaking of live tv. I'm gonna do something really cheap. I'm gonna do not plex, but channels. Which is a DVR service because it can work with TV everywhere. So anything that potentially is TV everywhere accounts, I can DVR those. I can do a whole, but then you need a cable subscription. Not necessarily, it's not just cable. It's a bunch of other stuff too. Oh, I see. So I th I'm think it might work with par plus. I can find out, but, but then it also gives me all the live TV and it gives me access to like two B and all of those things, which gives you CNN and all of that. Yeah. Wait, so explain how channels works for people who don't know. This is, this is like deep streaming nerd stuff. You gotta, you gotta walk us through it. So it's basically a DVR service. And you can plug in if you've got a HD Home Run tuner you, you just plug that in and it automatically pulls down anything you get over the air. And you can DVR that. You can also attach M three U playlists, which is what two B and Pluto and all of those free services offer. So you can then have all of those channels as well. And just like watch all of the channels like you watch normal tv. So I can watch all of the Carol Burnett show. I. And that's all I care about in the world. Shows from 40 years ago. I'm just an old woman. This is a power move. This definitely like violates the spirit of the game, but I like it. So we're gonna allow it. Yeah, this is great. We should actually, you should definitely draft a kicker in the first round. Like, I don't know. Hundred percent. Yeah. I'm just drafting all the teams all at once. Yeah, all of them. It's, it's an absolute cheat. And if you tell me no, I'll, I'll, I'll accept it. I'll accept it. But no, this is absolutely, this is a paid streaming service. Yeah. It's in the rules. It's totally, it's a paid service and it requires way more work and effort than any of the other ones we've discussed here so far. What is the, like, I've never gotten past the sort of like initial setup hurdle of channels because it is, mm-hmm. Like you said, you need special hardware. You need to like, have done real work to get it set up once it's like up and running. Is it easy or do you have to like Tomagotchi style tend to your channels? Yeah, it's totally easy. Okay. Like I was getting, there was some sport, I don't remember which one that my brother couldn't get with Fios at his house, but I could get it over the air. And so I just sent him the code, like the IP address for my server and he was just watching his sport live and was totally fine and he. Many miles away from me. So like, it works super, super easy once you get it set up. I, I do feel like anything that starts with the phrase, I sent him, the IP address of my server. Uh, is objectively not super, super easy. Yeah. It was just like phone number. He was just like, I need a number for this. What's the number? And I sent him the number and he's like, okay. Done. And then he was, he was good to go. That's fair. Type these numbers. Yeah. Yeah. So it, it works, it works great. But you do have to get it set up. We probably should have said at the top that we all get the, the over the air broadcast channels for free. Right? That's, yeah. Yeah. You can't draft an antenna. Yeah. Right. You can't draft an antenna. You just have one. It's the free space on the bingo cards. I'm just enjoying all of them waiting for ATS 3.0, ATSC 3.0 to save our lives. It's never gonna happen. Oh boy. But if it does, I'm ready. I look forward to you drafting ATSC 3.0 every draft for the next 20 years. I'm just throwing away all of your picks on that one. Ooh. Um. Okay. I, I actually like that pic lot. That was that. That's very good. Um, I get two picks now and I have three that I'm choosing from and I need the two of you to help me. Um, we're just gonna talk through this together. Oh, boy. Uh, so there's Netflix. I'm your enemy. Yeah, no, just, we're just, we're gonna talk this through. It's ultimately my decision and I know you're lying to me, so it's, we'll, we'll get there. Uh, there's Netflix, there's Amazon Prime video. And there's Discovery Plus, these are the three I'm debating between really, these are all the kind of like Wow V volume plays, right? Like a Prime video just has a billion movies to watch. Most of them are bad, but they're there. Netflix has infinite stuff, including like every bad reality show that I like right now. And then Discovery Plus. Basically for me it's like the HGTV and murder shows for my wife service. Uh, so these all kind of serve the same purpose. But you already have YouTube, right? Like YouTube has all the HGTV kind of shows only they're made by, they're like SL uglier because they're made by just a dude in his house. Yeah, they're just worse. Like I have watched a lot of the Architectural Digest, uh, celebrities show you their house tours. Love. I love that. Yeah, but sometimes I wanna see people try and fail to flip their own house. It's very important to me. Uh, I think, I think I have to pick Netflix here just because Netflix is like, yeah, it's both a giant of the space and also just has a mountain of content that really nobody else can touch. So I think I'm gonna pick Netflix here. This is your background music choice. This is what you're saying. You just want stuff that's on. Yeah, this is my, like, something good to watch, but. Have a specific desire for what I wanna watch, because the flip side is like Apple TV Plus is still sitting there, right? And Apple TV plus is like three shows that I love. And that's it. That's the whole service. Yeah, that's the, I'm drafting content. This is, this is why I asked Alex that question earlier, right? Like Right. You can either draft content or you get to this point and you're like, just stuff. Yeah. And I think, I think for me, I'm still in the just stuff. Uh, I just don't have enough show Loyalty is the thing that I'm realizing. Like I don't have that many things that I care so much about that I can't, like I know I used the first pick of the draft on stuff. Like that's what TikTok, it's just stuff like I get, I feel you. I think what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna do Netflix and I'm gonna do Discovery Plus. Uh, wow. And I now have just several lifetimes worth of relatively mediocre stuff to. Uh, and also whenever the next Squid game comes out, I have that disclosure. We, I'm in a Netflix ep, this show's called Future Oven, and David Chick watched, it's very good pick. I can watch it now. I'm the only one of us who's allowed to watch it from now on. Yeah. Uh, all right. Yeah, so there we go. I took it. I got, I have Netflix. This is good. I feel better now. I was doing bad after two rounds. Now I feel like I'm winning. I didn't even have Netflix. It wasn't even on my list. Netflix wasn't on your list. It wasn't even on my list. I got really mad at, they canceled some show I liked and so I stopped watching it for like three weeks and I was like, oh, I don't actually miss it that much. So that has been consistently my thing. I will say the, the reason I was bummed to not get H b O Max was that it's really the only one that I would like super, super notice if I didn't have it anymore. All the rest are like varying levels of good shows, but HBO Max is the one that's like, like I watched. Religiously not anymore. And almost all of the shows that I watch religiously on purpose are on H B O, which is crazy and wild, and kudos to HBO for continuing to be the only one to do that. But, uh, But yeah, Netflix is like, it's just a lot of stuff and it's better stuff than most of the other companies stuff. Mm-hmm. But it's still just stuff. Yeah. Uh, so I think I feel good about that. I'm taking Netflix for 20 bucks a month and Discovery Plus for seven bucks a month, and now my wife has all of the murder documentaries she can possibly want. You're welcome, Anna. I love you. Here's a question. Did you expect Netflix to fall this far? I definitely did. Is what? I'll tell you. I have, I ha It's on my list. It was like a late round, nice to have pickup. I figured it was either gonna be the first pick or extremely, extremely late and no middle ground there. Like either secretly, one of you was just a huge K drama fan and needed Netflix or, or like you really love Stranger Things and you just never talk about it. But I presumed it was either like that randomness or no, nobody was gonna pick it until the very end. Well, so that was the thing that was most surprising to me in going through this was how few. Incredibly compelling reasons. There were to pick Netflix, like, yeah, and this is the thing we've talked about a lot on this show, right? Like, Is great at having lots of shows and being available everywhere and its app works pretty well, but they're still in search of like the things that draw people to come to it on purpose and really like create cultural. They have a moments they have, they've had some wins. Like Squid Game was huge. Tiger Games, like they have these beats Wednesday. Yeah. Stranger Things Wednesday. Outer banks, like if you're a teenager in America, you're, we. They've got you. I've been watching the night. Recently. It's very good. It's just the like Puy spy show, but it's excellent. Yeah, and I don't know, I just feel like part of this, I'm definitely holding out hope that the next Gray Man movie on Netflix is better than the first one because I love that book series and I hate that movie. They gotta stop trying to make movies. This whole thing that they do where they're like, rich people make mo movies for lots of money. The Rock. You have an idea, put Cal ga. Like stop it. Like you dunno what you're doing. Yeah. None of them have been any good. What was the Michael Bay one with the numbers? In the title, oh, was it six Underground? Yes. I, that's the numbers in the title. Yeah, that's what I got for you. All right, so now we are, we are into round four already. Uh, Alex, you're up next. What do you got? Yeah. Ooh, I think I'm gonna go Criterion. Oh, I pay for it already. I really enjoy it. It's got like, it's probably got the. Set of Hong Kong action films that you can find in streaming. It's really hard to find those in streaming. And it's actually got a whole bunch of 'em, especially they, like a bunch of Michelle yo stuff is just popped up on there. Uh, it's got a lot of like old classic musicals, which that's like some people watch YouTube. I just go and like watch specific dance scenes from old classic musicals and I can just do that on Criterion and it's got a bunch of documentaries. I'm enjoying my choice. This is a good pick. I didn't even have criterion on my list, but that's a, that's a really good pick. And Criterion also does a really good job with like, they have a lot of bonus features They do. Cool. Like behind the scenes stuff, it's like, it is probably like the film buffs, most film buffs. Yeah. Thing. There's like a ton of movies on there. I will never, ever watch, but I, I like that I could, if I really wanted to, if I wanna go watch some French Nu. I can do that. I'm not going to, but I like that. I know I can, but you can. I like that. I like, I have that flex on other people, but yeah, I was, it was this in another one and I'm hoping nobody picks my other one. Nea, did you have criterion on your list? I did not. Yeah. You should have waited on Criterion. It's a good pick, but I had not even, it had not even occurred to me to think about. D once we get in these rounds, it's all bets are off. Like Alex is just off in the woods, she's like, all right. Channels and the criterion streaming surveys. I'm like, wee over in a corner. I'm having a great time. This is great. Uh, all right. No, it's a, it's an excellent pick, by the way. I think that's very smart. Yeah. It's just a big nerdy art pick. And ironically, maybe the single most likely candidate to still be around a bunch of years from now. Like, I don't know if I would pick against criter. In this longevity. Yeah, because they got killed once and they came back like, yeah, they're gonna, they're gonna live forever now. People still like black and white movies, including my father-in-law who every time we go visit is like, have you seen this movie from 1936? And I was like, Nope, haven't seen it. And he's like, well, let's watch it tonight. So I'm getting a film education. It's lovely. Uh, all right, now, uh, O'Neil, you get two now. So wait, I feel like this is unfair cuz we, you and I keep getting two in our own. Alex is going in between us. I'm like, how? Yeah, but it means we have to wait. I feel like this draft order makes more sense when you have more. Like it just, right now it's just you and I get two in a row and then Alex, and then I'm like, I'll pick Criterion. I think Alex has gotten every single thing she wanted, so I don't feel bad for that. I've been, you guys are off in sports land over there and I'm a little gremlin picking up Star Trek and movies. I'm like too in strategy. Alex is like, I'm drafting a binder full of DVDs. Yeah. Yeah. Alex is not having a bad time in this draft. She's just drafting offensive linemen all the way down. I'm just noting for the record, a serpentine draft with three people feels a little off, but Alex, given her strategy, has not paid a price. Yeah. Yes. You can't lose. All right. I have a rules question. She, you said this about YouTube, that you get a music service for free. Mm-hmm. Are we only drafting video services or do I have to put a music service in the mix? If you want a music service, you can draft a music service. But if I don't, like, are we just assuming that everyone has a Spotify subscription on the side? Or if I don't draft one, do I not listen to music? If you don't draft one, you have to use one for free. Um, you can have, if you, okay, if you don't draft one, you get ad supported Pandora. That's, that's, that's the baseline. All right. Just I, that was important cuz you, you took YouTube. No, you make, you make a perfectly reasonable point. You get free Pandora as it's like, that's like the only, or free Spotify podcast, cash channels or free, no free Pandora, endora. You can't even spot sign up for free Spotify, no ad supported Pandora. That's it. All right, then I'm taking Apple Music easy. Okay. Ah, she knew I should have picked that last. Why Apple Music? Uh, I'm an Apple Music person. I, I, I, I think the interface is calm. It doesn't seem like the music industry is perpetuating some sort of three card Monty situation with me every time I open it. Fair. Uh, I like that they have lossless. I can't tell you if I can actually hear it or not, but I, I like that it's there, it's like a binky for me. Uh, and you know, I'm an old head, so it sort of seamlessly imported my iTunes library from way. Then I still just like gaze upon it from time to time. Yeah. How much of the music service choice is like inertia as opposed to anything else? Because I even had this thought when I picked YouTube and got YouTube music, I was like, Ugh, do I still need to pick Spotify? Cuz I've like had Spotify for 10 years and it's gonna be a gigantic pain in the ass to switch. Uh, is it just the switching costs? Like if you were starting over, would you still pick Apple Music? Uh, well it depends. I think the switching cost. It's not money, right? It's like, can I get all of these old records? Right? Will it know what music will it have my music? Like I am not a curated playlist person unless I'm just like yelling at a voice assistant to start playing some music, you know? Sure. Um, I'm like, I'm gonna listen to this album. I wanna listen to these songs. Uh, so there's just a part of me that's very much, it's hard to. Unless you know that I want the entire like clash catalog, the entire Cure catalog, like I'm still there, I'm still doing that thing. If that was easier, I would happily switch. But having like open an app and like go tell it which 18 records I want to pre-populate and have download it again is a very high switching cost and I don't have to pay it Apple Music. That's fair. Alex, which, are you gonna pick a music service or can we talk about music service? I think I might still pick a music service all but it's a secret. Then we'll hold off and we'll, we'll come back to this at the end because I, I want to talk more about music streaming, cause I think it's a fascinating piece of this. All right, Mila, you have another pick, but we're gonna pause between your picks again. We're gonna take one more break and then we're gonna come do the last round and then all of the insane cleanup we have to do to make any, just make any sense. All right, we're back. Let's just recap. We've done four rounds. We have one more round to go. So far, Eli has picked TikTok, the Disney bundle, YouTube tv, and Apple Music. And just based on my math here is spending like a little over a hundred dollars a month so far. So, yeah, but I, I've got. All I'm living the brand name lifestyle, man. I'm the luxury mall. You really are you. It's really true. Alex has picked HBO Max Paramount plus slash Showtime, the Channels app and the Criterion Collection because Alex exists on a different planet from the rest of us. Alex lives in Brooklyn. It's true. And Alex is spending in the realm of like $45 a month. Somewhere in that range. Uh, I have YouTube, peacock, Netflix, and Discovery Plus, because I live in the Midwest and I am, I am, I am an American mom. You get the little haircut to the side. Yeah, and let's see. I'm spending 60 bucks all in. So I would say it's very unlikely that Eli loses the who spends the most. So congrats to NI Eli already. And now we are onto our fifth and final round. Ne Eli, you're up. What do you got? All right. I'm picking between two. Okay. They're radically different. I'm so excited. I'm gonna do it. I'm just gonna say this out loud. I'm picking my buddy Viens plex server. It's really good. I can just text him. Tell us about Zins Plex server. Well paint us a word picture. I've known Vipin for a long time. He's, uh, he's been running this thing for a long time. He has, it's au all automatic, it's all legal content. It's just Linux distributions. Yeah. Uh, and whenever I want a new Linnux distribution, I just text him and it appears. Channels does that too. You don't have to ask questions about where they come from. Uh, look, every now and again, I'm like, oh, I need the latest version of Red Hat Vi's Daughter's about the same age as my daughter. So it's, it's often that he has the same, uh, needs of Linux. How are Viens metadatas, uh, my understanding. Is it, uh, much of the metadata cleanup you need to reliably distribute Linux around your home is automated. Sometimes you just wanna watch Linux, you know what I mean? Sometimes it's Friday night and you just wanna put on Linux and watch it for two hours. Every now and again, you're just like, uh, yeah. You know, FOSS is like, where I live. Are you paying for Plex Pass? Uh, no. No, no, no, no, no. So, so no Offline, no. Yeah. This is just a, this is just a, a cleanup pick at the end. You know? Yeah. If you draft your first round quarterback and you pick one in the seventh round, just to put some competition and make sure that's what, that's why I'm doing this. Okay. I love this. I like it. What was your other choice if you didn't pick that? Uh, hilariously randomly, Sirius xm. What? Yeah. Uh, that, and that's straight up. There's like three shows that Becky listens to that are almost, you just almost picked Apple Music in Sirius XM back to back. Yeah. Do you live in a car? I picked, I picked the general hilarity of the Linux conversation over the actual need of making my wife happy. What does she listen to on Sirius? Uh, there's like a bunch of comedy podcasts that too unserious. They're only unserious, so shit like, that's why we have it. And then I do actually live in the car and so I listen to a lot of Sirius in the. What's your go-to? What do you listen to? Uh, are you a yacht rock guy? Not yacht rock, uh, lithium. The, obviously the Altern rock. Oh. And uh, first wave. Nice. You can tell where my music tastes like fully lie. So the other thing that's completely insane to do, If you have a serious subscription, you spend a lot of time in the car and you just need voices, is you can listen to CNBC as an audio stream, and that is the most insane podcast that you can listen to, like Jim Kramer eight in the morning, just like yelling about money is. I definitely don't feel sleepy, I'll tell you that much. And it's Jim Kramer saying, look at this chart, and you saying, Jim, I can't, I can't see the chart. Uh, it is a, it is a vastly different experience to listen to it as an audio feed in the morning. Okay. I just wanna say about Sirius XM that I bought a car. Mm-hmm. Which meant that I got three free months of Sirius xm, which I used zero times because I couldn't even figure out how to set it up. And then since it elapsed, I would say I either get a phone call or a piece of physical mail from Sirius XM asking me to resubscribe every single day. And I have now become resolute that I will never, ever, ever listen to Sirius XM as long as I live just out of. Yeah, I mean, but I'm commuting from the woods to the city once a week, so I spend five hours in a single day in the car often. Um, and it's like, great. But like why, like honestly for the purpose of this draft, that's very utilitarian, like we're making entertainment here and it's, it's vi and flex server, which I'm assuming is free Vipin doesn't charge you server fees. We, again, we're friends for a long time. It, it all evens out in. All right. All right. I've brought him a lot of drinks over the years. We're, we're putting a zero next to vi's PL server. We'll put, we'll put 99 cents, cuz you have to buy 'em a beer every once in a while. Yeah. Plus 99 cents a month. Uh, all right. Last pick. Alex, what do you got? What's the, what's the Apple service thing? That's the Apple music and the Apple tv. Apple one. Apple one Apple. So, yeah, I'm, that's good. That's good. That's good. I gotta spend a bunch of money and do that one because I too like Apple Music more than Spotify and Apple Music, classical. I've actually been using that, uh, way more than I thought I would. And then I think Apple TV's like, it's got good content. I watch the content, I enjoy it. What do you watch? What are your shows? Um, really into Dickinson. I loved that when it came on severance for all mankind. The morning show. I don't watch the morning show. That's a lie, but it's there. Ted Lasso. I haven't watched the season of Ted Lasso. I think that says a lot. It hasn't even occurred to me to spend time doing it. Yeah, it's fine. It's, it's a, it's a show. You know what is good? It's happy is Hello tomorrow. Is it actually good? Weird but delightful. I've only watched like four episodes, but it's very good. Shrinking, also very good. This is the thing about Apple CV Plus, it doesn't have that much stuff, but it's like good show to bad show ratio is probably higher than any other platform I can think of. Like Dickinson is a show. I will, I will rewatch. It's one of my rewatch shows at this point. I just, I love it. And then for all mankind, like it's great. You watch people get progressively worse makeup as they pretend to age 10 years every. And then go into space with iPods. It's rat. Yeah. I love it. Yeah. So I'm all content. Alex, that was a really good pick. I'm sort of annoyed because you also, for Apple one, you get Apple Arcade and you get a bunch of iCloud storage that you will never use. Uh, yeah, but that's a, that's a pretty good pick. If I, if iCloud storage isn't, then Alex is finally with the last pick, snaked the most important pick in the draft. Yeah, you guys are all gonna be getting that obnoxious iCloud. I don't think I constructed, like, if not, we need to redo this whole thing. I'm gonna take Dropbox Business as my class pick. Um, okay. So what's your final one? I have two. I have two left on my list, which serve very different purposes for me. Mm-hmm. One is Amazon Prime video. Um, okay. Which was what I was gonna pick if I didn't get YouTube because it's another one that's just like a big bunch of content plus of music service for free. So that was exciting. And then there's Hulu with live tv, which I want to pick because I like Hulu because it also has a couple of my, like endlessly rewatched shows. Uh, and because I need live sports, um, I think I'm gonna pick Hulu, I think Hulu with live tv, which is 70 bucks a month. Uh, It comes with, well, okay, here's a rules clarification question. If I sign up for Hulu Live tv, I also get the Disney bundle I like back into the Disney bundle. Does that count? Mm mm It's, it's just, it's way more expensive, but, but I get it. And then live sports is essentially what I'm after here. Is this allowed? Are we allowing this? Wait, there's no way to get Hulu with live TV without getting Disney Plus. No. You just get it. It's 70 bucks a month. Like they're just, they're like, sure have Disney. You want some tarbucks. So much money. Yeah. I mean, I think this is allowed. Okay. I came at Hulu the other way. Right. And I, I, if I hadn't blown my cost, if I hadn't blown the salary cap with Sunday ticket, we, we would be competing here and I think it would be fair. Okay. All right. Good. I buy it. Um, then yeah, I'm taking Hulu Live tv. 70 bucks a month. I get Disney Plus I get ESPN plus I get New Girl, which is just about to leave Netflix and go to Hulu, which is another one of the shows I've watched 700 times. Uh, shit's Creek is there. It's another one I've watched How I met, oh my God, this is an incredible sleeper, final pick. But like Neil and I both have access to that. He can just hit up his buddy. I have YouTube tv. My last pick is Neely giving me Pippin's number. That's my, that's my final pick. All that's on there is Linux. You guys stop it. Just love that red hat. Yeah, I really like, I did not mean to do this. I accidentally ended up with like the most down the middle set of streaming services. This is really upsetting. Uh, alright. Right. So we have done five picks. Congratulations to everybody we draft who wins. Andrew, do you have a cool. Last sound for the end of the draft. Andrew, you've been keeping track of everything, all the math, all the money, uh, totaled up for us. How are we doing? Give us the recap. Uh, okay, so Nilay, collectively 1 0 4 98 a month, plus the 2 89 right for the Sunday ticket, which would be 3 93 90. One time payment of that 2 89, but still Alex, it's lowest here at 63 92. Good work. Frugal David, you really added it up with Hulu at live TV coming at 1 29 95. Whoa. A month I got, I got football and a kind of cheaper monthly. Picking Netflix was a mistake. Now that I'm looking at it. 20 bucks for Netflix was a bad use of 20 bucks a month. Yeah. YouTube premium family is a lot of buddy. Poof. Yeah. But, but the reason, okay, let me defend family real fast. I don't have to watch ads. Even when Anna wants to watch YouTube, which is worth the extra. That's true. That's true. Uh, but okay, so that means Alex, you get, you get the free pick here at the. Ooh. Anything you want, sky's the limit. Okay. Does this one count? Libro fm? Oh my god, Alex, I gotta read, I gotta read my books. So it's an audiobook service doesn't count. It's an audiobook. Service doesn't count? No. Okay. All right then. I don't know why it just, it just doesn't, I just can't just like, no, I can't wait. It's an audiobook streaming service, or is that just like a, like a book? There's an audiobook service and you get like a credit to buy a book each month. Okay. All right, cool. Well, that's great. I, I still, I still can read books on my own time. I needed to make sure I was gonna be allowed to read books. Um, what's the Microsoft, the Microsoft streaming cloud thing for games? I don't know the name of it. Oh, that's interesting. Xbox Live Cloud games. There we go. It's changed its names so many times. Yeah, I like, I think of it as Microsoft X Cloud, but whatever it's actually called now, that one, I just call it Game Pass. I think it has a more complicated name, but everybody just calls it Game Pass. Yeah, that's a good, that's also a good way to put it. Yeah. Game pass. Then I get, I get So you ended up with the two game services with Apple One, you got Apple Arcade and now you're, you're going with Game Pass. Yeah, but I'm not gonna use Apple Arcade. Like Andrew Webster is the only person I know that uses Apple Arcade. But now you have it for free. Now I have it for free. Yeah. And then I play the other games while I'm watching my criterion. Really good. Wild card pick at the end. Man. That is a really good. Huh, because it was either that or Plex, but I already did channels, which gives me the same benefit as Plex, but a better DVR layout. It can still, stuff still sometimes adds to it when I don't DVR it. It's wild. It's crazy. Does it, this means that Amazon Prime went completely unpicked, which I, I was, yeah. I think is not totally surprising. Yeah. I How often are you like, oh man, I just really gotta watch like extraction, but even more boring and on a worse UI again, because Becky is so into comedy, every now and again, there's like one comedy special on Amazon. Yeah, I think that's it. There's there. Pick Alex. That was a really good pick that I feel like I, if I had thought of that I probably would've picked a while ago. Game Pass is good and also like a strong future bet. Like if we come back and the question is like, how did all our bets do? Yeah. Game Game Pass is gonna exist. Yeah. Like the majority of mine will still be around except for probably my first two maybe. I feel great about my draft. So this is gimme, it's a, this is a solid year ahead. Yeah. So I, on the, all the sports on my list, the only things that went unpicked that I still have on my list are, uh, nobody picked Prime video. Nobody picked Spotify. Which is very interesting. Um, we're all happy with our other weird services or free Pandora. Uh, and, and then I have a bunch of, like, I wrote down, you know, freebie and Tubi and Pluto TV and the Roku channel and all that stuff, and Sling, and nobody picked any of that. I'm not super shocked. Uh, but see, I get, I get the Roku channel because it does an M three U playlist so I can watch it anytime on channels. Yeah. Go. Here's what I'm saying. I, if this draft had had like two or three more people, I think the, the drafting around those channels would've been intense, especially cuz then they would've, they would've been how you would strategically have lowered the cost to try to get that extra pick. That's interesting. All right. Well next year, we'll, this draft will include 13 people. Yeah. We're gonna have a 32 team draft next year and everybody gets five picks. It's gonna be, yeah. If everyone's gonna start diving around the bottom of the. This is rough. Although I will say even in this draft, David, I felt as though I was stealing picture from you, and I don't think I did that really, except maybe for Sunday ticket. Neither of us was competing with Alex. No, no one was really confusing. Alex is fully trust the process, like whatever was going on over there. I will say I was hoping that my three and four picks were gonna be YouTube and TikTok. That was gonna be the turn I made at three and four. I thought one of you would take hbo, one of you would take Disney, and then I would get YouTube and TikTok and just like laugh at you old people about how I understand the future. And it didn't really work out that way, unfortunately. And no one took Instagram reels. Well you took TikTok, so you basically took Instagram reels. But if you want, if you wanted that thing Instagram, right, you, you want Diet TikTok, you take Instagram reels. I like that. I'm not gonna know anything about the real world after my picks. I don't know what's happening's Not that different from what you came into this with. Yeah. So you're, you're good there. Like I, I've learned nothing about the draft in this whole process, and I'm not going to with my picks. Amazing. I love it. Um, all right, we should go. We're gonna do this again next year, and we're gonna have to come up with some score by which we see how we did this year. Uh, we'll figure it out, presumably also today as this show goes live. There's an event at which HBO O Max and Discovery Plus may cease to be what they currently are. So this might all get real weird, real fast. Uh, we'll have lots more to talk about. Thank you both for doing this. This was very fun. Yeah, super fun.",

    "transcript": "- [Jonathan] Yo guys, Jonathan here and welcome to my Perfect iMac Pro Setup. (upbeat music) So, yep, that is an iMac Pro on a desk outside. You're not crazy. The reason behind this is I thought it'd be fun to take this outside, shoot AK raw, and then use that to test on this iMac Pro. So with the setup, I wanted something clean, something simple, but most importantly, I wanted something to compliment and match that beautiful space gray finish. So the centerpiece of this setup is without a doubt the iMac Pro and for those who love talking specs, get them wet naps ready. This is the 10-core, three gigahertz model. 128 gigabytes of RAM, AMD Radeon Pro Vega 64 graphics with, get ready for it, 16 gigabytes of HBM2 memory. Last but not least, this is packed with two terabytes of flash storage, which should be insanely fast. Now these go on sale this Thursday and alongside the 10-core there is the baseline 8-core, a surprise 14-core model and it will max out at 18 freaking cores. Now for the desk, I went with the ARTIFOX DESK 02. This is their limited run black edition. It's very simple but also extremely well thought-out and compliments the iMac Pro perfectly. Now this comes in both sit and stand variations and what's awesome is it's extremely modular. So you go simple like I've done here or you can deck it out with a ton of different accessories to complement your setup. Now a couple of really smart things that come with this desk out of the box is one, you have a little cable drop towards the back so in my case I threw a wireless charger here, dropped that cable right through and it keeps things nice and clean. And for those curious about the wireless charger, this is from Kroma Wireless and I will say on the Amazon page it looks like it's space grey, clearly it's not. As much as I would have loved space grey, this is still a really nice accent and the best part about it is that it's under 15 bucks. Now the second really smart thing with this desk is towards the front you have hooks on each side. You can probably hang a ton of different things but in this case it works amazing for a pair of headphones. So the headphones are the Focal Listen closed back over ear headphones and these were perfect for two reasons. One, aesthetically this complemented the entire setup really well and more importantly, two, they sound amazing. Focal makes some crazy high-end gear but these are under 200 bucks and honestly they're probably one of the best headphones you can get under that price point. And for the keyboard, the mouse, and in this case the trackpad I didn't have to look elsewhere because they all came with the iMac Pro. The black keys with the space grey finish on the keyboard look beautiful across the desk. Honestly, I'm not the biggest fan of the Magic Mouse but in that finish it was hard not to include with this setup. Lastly, that space grey Magic Trackpad 2, no complaints there. It works well and has the looks to match. Now as far as the speakers go, I don't think I could have planned this out any better. They weren't tweaked, modified, or customized. The Kanto YU2 Powered Desktop speakers come in this matte gray finish that is nearly a perfect match for the space grey iMac Pro. They're small but they pack a surprising amount of punch and what's cool is you connect them directly via USB to the iMac Pro. So the size paired with the finish and more importantly, how it fits on this desk all work perfectly. Now jumping to the back of the iMac Pro this thing is pretty decked out. You have a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack, an SDXC card slot with UHS-II support, four USB 3.0 ports and then four Thunderbolt 3 ports in the USB-C flavor which is double what you get on the non-pro iMac. Last up is the Ethernet port but the big thing here is that it's 10 gigabit which is a pretty big deal. Now as far as performance goes, over the next week I will be putting this thing through its paces but to get the obligatory geek bench score out of the way, on the single core side we're looking at 5,450 but more impressively, on the multi-core side that is 37,434. So on the outside it looks like an iMac Pro with a space grey finish but on the inside it is clearly a different story. From there, if you're looking for some more insight on the iMac Pro, my good buddy Marques aka MKBHD also spent some time with one. You can check out his impressions here or link down below it. If you haven't yet, I'd definitely make sure you subscribe for more iMac Pro coverage. This is Jonathan and I will catch you guys later. - [Man] The design, the stand, the display, the bezels it's all the same but what makes this iMac Pro an iMac Pro...",

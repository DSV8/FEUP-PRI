    "transcript": "- Knock knock. - [James] Who's there? - Tech news. - [James] I should have seen that coming. - Just tech news! So gaming laptops and portability have never exactly gone hand in hand. But, Intel thinks it might have the solution as details of its new Iris Xe MAX mobile GPUs recently dropped. - [Announcer] Intel's first discreet graphic solution for thin and light laptops. - Unlike the standard Iris Xe, this is actually a discreet GPU that Intel is marketing to both content creators and casual gamers who don't wanna lug around a heavy laptop. Intel seemed particularly proud of something called, Deep Link, which is a form of machine learning that can intelligently load balance between an integrated and discreet GPU to increase performance and battery life. As far as actual frame rates, Intel is saying that Xe MAX will get in the range of 30 to 45 frames per second at 1080p, in a number of modern AAA titles. If you turn the settings down a bit. So, it's not revolutionary, but it looks, okay enough, considering that Intel is going to be launching a higher performance gaming chip next year, which will hopefully show up in laptops, and hopefully not heat the bezel up to fry an egg temperatures. If you're just desperate at this point, to get your hands on any graphics card from the RTX 3000 series, there might be even more bad news on the horizon. There's a rumor, and we want to clarify, it's just a rumor at this point, that the RTX 3060 Ti has been pushed back a couple of weeks, from November 17th to December 2nd. Again, take this with a grain of salt because Nvidia hasn't even officially confirmed that there is a 3060 Ti at all. But it's hard to imagine team green would wait too long to release a more mid range chip. Performance is speculated to be somewhere around the level of the last gen RTX 2080 Super for less than $400, which would make it a pretty compelling deal, if it's true. And if you could buy one before the bots get to them all and they're on eBay for $900. For those of you in the UK, you probably know that the country is preparing for a second pandemic lockdown that's supposed to start this Thursday Unsurprisingly, this has left many gamers concerned about important things like, what's gonna happen to their PS5 and X-Box series pre-orders as both consoles are due to launch mid-November. - [James] Drone delivery. - Because the lockdown is (mumbles) that would work. Because the lockdown is supposed to last until at least early December, people have been concerned that they may not get their consoles, in time. But one major retailer has told consumers they still have until Wednesday night to pre-order in store. And the UK government has said that businesses can stay open for delivery and pickup, even for non-essential items like console, what do you mean, non-essential items? You know, might be essential if you review games for a living. - [James] Or play them-- - Or are bored. - [James] for fun. - [Linus] Today's bit quits are brought to you by the Seasonic Prime Ultra Titanium PC Power Supply. It's the creme de la creme of power supplies with ultra high efficiency, 80 plus titanium rating, fully modular interface and, it comes with a power supply tester, which is super useful if you're tryna do like, custom cooling or whatever. You even get a fan with a fluid dynamic bearing and hybrid fan control to keep the noise down. With a 50,000 hour life expectancy backed by a 12 year warranty, what are you waiting for? Other than the price, it's not cheap. But if you got money, you can buy it at the link below. Onto the bit quits. Speaking of money, Bitcoin seems to be continuing its recovery from the infamous crash that it had experienced a couple of years ago that I'm still reeling from. This weekend, Bitcoin got up to about 14,000 US dollars, it's highest value since January of 2018. Although there's been a surge in interest in cryptocurrency recently, it isn't clear why Bitcoin specifically is doing so well. Just whatever you do, don't pay 10,000 Bitcoin for a pizza like that one guy did way back in the day. Ouch, right? (mumbling in background) Facebook is finally rolling out a test of a dark mode feature on both Android and iOS. Trials so far have been extremely limited, which has frustrated many users since most other oft used social media apps have some sort of dark mode already. Better late than never, Mark. - [James] His soul is dark enough already. - The original Crysis has already gotten a remake. And now it sounds like remasters of both Crysis Two and Three are in the works. It's not clear how long it might be until we actually see them, since even the Crysis One remaster was delayed by about seven months, which wasn't enough. And it will be interesting to see how the games look especially Crysis Three which is still sometimes used as a benchmark and is pretty good looking. - [James] Crysis Three-mastered! - Like, are they just tryna make them hard to run on purpose at this point? If you were looking to slap a custom face plate on your shiny new PlayStation Five, by the way, prepare to be disappoint. As Sony has ordered a third-party manufacturer to stop making them. Reportedly Sony's lawyers told them, that Sony owned the IP rights to the face plates. Now, it's unclear why a licensing deal wasn't just worked out. Could be the usual corporate greed or, maybe the face plates have some kind of undisclosed chip in them. - [James] First-party plates. - Or maybe the third-party ones just suck. And Sony thinks that only they know how to face plate it right. Whatever the reason is, you can't get one right now. And, heads up. There's another Apple event scheduled for the 10th, which is a week from, tomorrow. It's online only but it's still expected to be a major announcement, as most outlets are speculating, that it will be the unveiling of the new Apple Silicon Macs. As usual, Apple is officially mum on details, but we all know what's coming. It's kinda like how you should never be surprised that anything happens in professional wrestling, for example. Although that whole thing where they aren't letting them go on Twitch anymore. That was sort of, dirt baggy and surprising. - [James] Even their news got news. - Yeah, that sucked. That's our show, come back Wednesday, where we elbow drop y'all with some more tech news. The people's tech news elbow! (glass shattering) Oh God!",

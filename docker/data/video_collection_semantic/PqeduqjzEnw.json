    "transcript": "well hello good people I constantly get asked about what's in my travel backpack gear wise so let me show you welcome to your new tea board train first attach the magnetic wrist rest it simply pops in don't forget about the USB pass-through port and the headphone jack to simplify your connectivity you and the boss of the meeting control which is right over here fiery red tea caps are included because it is a gaming product with RGB / key elimination and under the hood we've got cherry MX silver speed and blue switches for those legit actuations and finally don't forget about the voice control enjoy your new x1 by thermaltake check it out in the description below alright people so in front of me is my super compact travel gear accessory kit you know all these items are little they're inexpensive you can buy them in description below thank you very much it helps us out all the affiliation is down the description below but you know potentially highlight some things that you might want or need for your next trip or your everyday life so first let's begin with the spout something that I didn't used to travel with but now this goes with me everywhere it's awesome because you know backpacks have pockets and stuff like that but those things can you know little things can get lost and this is awesome because all this tech pretty much aside from the bigger stuff goes inside here and I know where to access you know though USB drives little velcro straps whatever everything goes inside it opens up nice and wide it has these tightening bands on the interior different pockets so you can reorganize however you want for little items or larger items everything just sits nicely inside this bag it also has an exterior pocket for easy access which I love they come in different colors too and basically just a pocket that's super handy for your tech or whatever else you might put inside but now moving onto the necessities I never travel without a flashlight sure our smartphones have one but these guys are actually super inexpensive the batteries already are included it's waterproof and it's also a lot more powerful than any smartphone flashlights so in India for example I lost something in the grass and definitely was in search of a flashlight but luckily you know found some stuff and this is why I carry a designated flashlight with me now the cool thing about this one is that it has an expandable light beam so you can narrow the beam if you have if you want a longer light output or you can widen the beam to cover a larger surface area it's awesome too for light painting so if you're doing photography night photography especially and want to paint something in the shot a flashlight definitely will do the trick now moving on they never travel without a battery bank I used to travel with like very small capacity of milliamps but they would just drain way too quickly so I picked up a twenty thousand milliamp hour capacity battery bank it is a bit on the heavy side and the charge is super slow but once this is charged you can last you for a couple days definitely without you needing to plug anything into the wall this is awesome make sure to check out you know a bunch of their capacity this is by the way from Ankur yeah love this thing super handy now for wireless audio I decide to go with the Bose Soundlink micro simply because this thing is tiny it sounds fantastic for its size has a really good bass output at the bottom it is waterproof it's tough as well we have full controls for buttons on the actual speaker it has a little strap at the back that you can put on your backpack so when you were hiking or something you can listen to all your music I just wanted something that was compact sounded great and the only thing is that the firmware update is over bluetooth which takes forever but I'm pretty happy with this guy it is a little bit on the expensive side at $100 but I didn't want to cheap out on a Bluetooth speaker because I wanted something compact and sounded good and there are not many options that that satisfy that criteria yeah so this speaker is awesome for headphones though I'm rocking this son Heiser momentum Wireless I've had these for like four or five years they sound amazing the sound isolation on here it is active so it actually cancels out all the background noise is just incredible I take a lot of pictures on my trips which is why I have these two guys for all my storage needs the Silverstone so9 enclosure which I put in my own MDOT - SSD in there make sure to check out our video on that here and the HyperX savage drive - it's 128 gigabytes which is awesome so I can offload my entire SD card on here and have that backup now moving up to the smartphone territory I've been using the oneplus 6 myself as a daily driver but the red Edition recently came out it is absolutely gorgeous on camera it looks just as good as it does in real life the fingerprint scanner has a slightly different tone of red which you know if you like to pick out certain details you will it also doesn't pick up fingerprints as much as the black version because there's so much color and vibrancy is happening on here it kind of hides the finger marks they're still visible because it is still glass but I'm definitely going to be rocking the 1 + 6 red edition from now on I mean look at this thing it's absolutely gorgeous well done oneplus well done and to complement my smartphone photography I picked up these clip-on lenses for your smartphone the good thing about these because they're clipped on they can be attached to any smartphone and so I picked up the kid that has the super wide the fisheye and the macro lens I don't use the fisheye because the super wide already has the effect like that so the super wide is awesome the optics are not fantastic like you can have distortion but it's a really unique way to kind of experiment with your photography that expands your field of view and I'm definitely looking forward to using these on my upcoming trip now the good thing about the macro lens is it's super sharp and you have to be really close to your subject and the smartphone photos look absolutely amazing and yeah it just gives you a different perspective for smartphone photography when you travel and because they're so compact and actually super cheap - you don't have to have a particular case for it these are just clip-on lenses for your you know onto your smartphone you don't need additional accessories to use them they're awesome and so much fun to use and to clean the screen of the smartphone we have eye rollers they come in two different sizes like mini one and the standard one and these are amazing so you just roll them on your screen to clean all the fingerprints they actually remove bacteria which is great so it's for hygienic purposes and for visual purposes then the good thing about these is once they get all clogged up with a little gunk and like little particles on the actual rubber bit you just wash this with warm water let it air dry and boom you're ready to go it still has a lot of the adhesive onto the the rubber thing I've been using this for about a year and it still as basically just works as new so i rollers definitely recommended for my tripod needs because I'm taking my Sony a7 three for the vacation I had the Joby I think this one's for like the mirrorless one so it's the medium size which can support the the Sony camera the GH 5 no problem to that you can position anywhere but I also have this tiny Manfrotto one which is great for handheld stuff and just over time the legs have loosened up quite a bit I've had this for two years but it still is going pretty good and the last few things include this aperture m9 night it's awesome because it is super compact I think it can last for like an hour and a half at maximum brightness so it you know it recharges via its own battery it has gel so you can color your scene either with this blue or orange which is awesome and this thing definitely could come in handy anywhere if you need a little additional light for your photography or video and just like stash it anywhere else for a little kick or actually even fill as well the aperture m9 these are awesome and the last little thing are these gear ties so these are awesome because they can be used for any type of situation they are reusable rubber zip ties basically they have nice stiff this they can be used to lock your zipper on the backpack so if you in case you travel you know you're you have a little extra peace of mind you can fix your shoe in case your laces are broken because they're pretty thin they can pass through anything and whatever you need to tie for example my tripod boom so the legs don't open now this is around there that's awesome and just you can use them for absolutely anything low gear ties they're super inexpensive but so handy to have when you need them and now my first ever drone the maverick air this thing is amazing not only because it captures 4k 30fps video but it's a stable it's super fast it's easy to actually you know kind of learn how to fly a drone I was very nervous in the beginning but after a few flights you kind of get accustomed to it and you can you know perform some maneuvers this thing is awesome to capture things that you normally would not be able to do on vacation and I picked up the fly more combo which comes with three batteries a remote controller little bag so everything can just like compactly fit into this one little package that then goes into into my backpack this thing is awesome and they also have the ND filters for the camera for the drone because if you want to achieve that nice cinematic motion effects so that the shutter speed on this thing is low enough so you get motion blur these things are really handy and really bright and sunny situations which are most likely are wherever you go on vacation alright so that is my travel accessory pack I hope you found some of these items useful potentially for your next trip and I'm super excited to use these wide-angle lenses because just I know the distortion is there and they're not super clear in detail but it's like a new effect of you can achieve capturing so much area that you normally would not be able to do so yeah that is it thanks for watching let me know if I'm missing something and if there is a particular piece of tech gear that you travel with all the time let us know in the comments share the knowledge within the community I'm Dmitry make sure to check out this other relevant content subscribe to our new boot sequence channel and see you next week",

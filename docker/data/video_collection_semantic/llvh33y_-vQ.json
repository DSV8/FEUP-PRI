    "transcript": "- Ah, yes see, there is tech news today. How did I know that? How did I know that? I'm slicker than snake shit baby? Nvidia has been a very bad giant tech corporation lately. So the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission has just fined it for failing to disclose how big of an impact cryptocurrency mining had on its revenue growth in 2018. In investor communications Nvidia made it sound like miners buying up stock of GPUs didn't really contribute to a profit increase in its gaming business when in actuality, crypto miners, we're a big part of that. And you know what? I don't even need these 'cause they actually make that blurrier. They're for, that's for computer use. - [Riley] It really had an impact though. - Lying, that's pretty bad. The fine must be pretty big. It must be. Yeah, no it's $5.5 million, a veritable slap on the wrist for a company that made 7.6 billion in just the last quarter of 2021 alone. - [Riley] Yeah, me too, me too, me too. - The SEC has ordered Nvidia to stop with holding information from investors which I'm sure will work. This is a society. - [Riley] Just tell them to stop and bam. - This only works in Europe or anything. Almost two years after suing Apple and getting Fortnite kicked off iOS, Epic Games has finally made a deal to bring it back for everyone sort of. There's always a sort of. Fortnite is now free to play through Xbox Cloud Gaming meaning it doesn't matter whether you're on Android, Windows or an iPhone or iPad. You can open a browser and buy V-Bucks to your heart's content or your parents' wallet's content whatever it is. Nvidia has had an iOS compatible version of Fortnite available through a limited time closed beta on GeForce now but this solution only requires you to have a Microsoft account to play. Epic CEO, Tim Sweeney, what a sweetheart, originally didn't want Fortnite on xCloud but he's apparently had a change of heart but you can still go against his wishes to keep Fortnite off Steam Deck by playing it through the Microsoft Edge beta. Feels good to stick it to the man. Hey sweetie. Society, who needs it? Anarchy. - [Riley] Just meet you in the wilds. - Backwards hat. And Apple, Google and Microsoft have joined forces to kill all passwords using a giant password guillotine actually. - [Riley] On the moon. - No, the last letter it's gone. The three tech giants just announced a partnership with the FIDO Alliance F, F-I yeah. - [Riley] Yeah. - FIDO Alliance which stands for Fast Identity Online apparently. What's the D? ID. Okay, fast ID online. Okay, I get it apparently to push forward a secure sign-in method called Passkey. Basically any website or app you want to sign into would simply push a request to your phone then you just unlock and authenticate with a pin or a fingerprint or something. So basically it's like two-factor authentication but getting rid of the one factor that sucks because yeah, you might be a creative genius at making unique passwords but that's a bit like saying you're the best at shaping your mashed potatoes into a perfect well to pour the gravy in. Like, good job, I can't do that. - [Riley] You can't do that? - Not when I'm eating with two knives. - [Riley] Oh. - Now it's time for the quick bits brought to you by Vessi, maker of footwear known for being lightweight, easy to pack, comfortable and most importantly, waterproof. You can spit all over these. Vessi's Everyday Move shoes are perfect for those who are always on the move whether that's over regular ground or moist sloppy terrain. They've got enhanced breathability, added support and convenient pull tab. They can sway lace cages, extra midsole cushioning and of course the same waterproof Dyma-tex technology that's gonna make you wanna wear them everywhere. So keep your feet dry and save 25 bucks with our offer code techlinked at Vessi.com/techlinked. Quick bits. This one is just quick bits. - [Riley] Just like grandma made them. - Remember when they fired CEO of Arm's China division Allen Wu went rogue, stole the company seal and refused to leave the office? - [Riley] That's what I did. - He lives here now. He doesn't shower. Well, despite Arm China's board voting him out last week and Arm announcing that the issue was resolved, now the company's employees have rallied behind him writing a letter in support of Wu. This is like Trump, who has again, refused to step down. The corporate mutiny in the year of our Lord 2022. I guess it's time to resolve this with the only method that's sure to work, a dual. Allen Wu versus the SoftBank robots. - [Riley] Live streaming. - Meta has shown off impressive tech demos of nearly photo realistic VR avatars in the past but the company's actual playable avatars basically look like Nintendo Miis. - [Riley] Shots fired. - Speak for yourself Riley. But that might change thanks to a new processor developed by Meta for the sole purpose of rendering those fancier avatars in VR. I think we can take this to the next level. We need chips for rendering every specific thing in every video game ever and then we'll all be lining up at Best Buy to get the processing unit for food. - [Riley] Yeah, people will use 'em for food. That's the thing. - Chip shortage is famine. Rumors are pointing towards AMD's next-gen RX 7900 XT graphics card as the first consumer GPU with support for PCIe Gen5, a standard that doubles the bend with a PCIe Gen4 and which will be supported by AMD's upcoming AM5 compatible motherboards and CPU. All three components are expected to launch by the end of 2022 so prepare yourselves and pepper your angus for a new tech that could perform significantly better than current models. That's not always a given these days. - Oh wow. I can't, I'm so- - And neither is that launch date. We'll see. Oh my God, look. It's a swarm of drones that can track a person through a dense bamboo forest without human guidance. Great. Made by a scientist from China's Zhejiang. I'm- - [Riley] Definitely saying that wrong. - Bad at Chinese words. Sorry, Andy's laughing at me. - [Andy] I'm sorry. - Zhejiang University. The drones can communicate with each other which allows them to break formation to avoid obstacles and then reconstitute themselves sometimes in the form of a face like at the end of the \"Matrix 3\", possibly into a deadly Megazord of some sort. The last part we kinda just added. The researchers say that the drones could be useful for a disaster relief or disaster creation. No, they actually said that and ecological surveys, it's hilarious. And in case you thought fuellesss electric vehicles were the only way for it, a south African mining company called Anglo American, woo, on the list of canceled company names, has just deployed the world's largest truck powered by a hydrogen fuel cell engine specifically a two megawatt unit built by Seattle company, First Mode. So they can make the environment a little better while gouging materials out of the ground. - [Riley] You give and you take, you know. - That's life. We like buying stuff and we all knew this was coming but the tech news is gone but you can not be gone. On Monday, we'll be back. Will you?",

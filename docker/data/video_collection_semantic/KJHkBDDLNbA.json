    "transcript": "Wow look at this we just arrived to aria and look at this backdrop it's like a little water fountain through the roof through the wall wow it's pretty it's just water falling us going down the crevices and it's creating this little homey texture Wow very cool very cool now let's go seek manta and thanks here we go alright so last year when we were at CES here visiting Compton coffee thanks alright so last year when we were visiting Phanteks here the CES they have impeccable lighting they replaced all the bulbs and the problem most years is the fact that absolutely nobody has proper lighting in their Suites or on the show for so we will have to see what Phanteks does this year I see someone I know alright so the moment of truth beautiful view let's see if they have changed their light bulbs this time around and looks looks like they have wow this is the best suite the entire CES to get the best even lighting everything is great love it now you probably already have watched our P600 preview make sure to check the router over here but we have the Black Edition which is like all matte black but it is awesome to see the metallic gray version which has the same interior which is super cool so not just on the exterior but on the interior for a little extra accent stuff and all the light will bounce to the interior - and there's the white edition which is a slightly more glossy so matte black gray white but the main star of the show for Phanteks at CES this year is this new Phanteks Luxe 2- but first big thanks to our sponsors Thermaltake Razer Phanteks corsair and msi for making our CES possible so what Phanteks wanted to do with the Luxe 2 is basically just redesign the full Tower and kind of focus on the features so the luxe 2 is premium but it is like the less expensive than the evolv X so this one's gonna go for 189 dollars and the target the release date is around q2 so it is cheaper than the evolv X because the lux 2 reduces the aluminum enclosure for the exterior so there's some different materials and focus on internal features so it's a super efficient design we're told in this price segment so it has some primo and elite elements so at the original bottom design for example like putting the power supply on the side for more airflow from the bottom we have that L design soft illumination that spans the top the front the bottom and now it's actually enters on to the interior to highlight the PSU shroud and this is actually the first time that they're adding lighting to the interior that's tasteful and addressable to match the exterior design theme and as with the P600s they've gone with this fabric material on the exterior I really like it on the sides because it Slim's down the frame and gives you the perception that was likely you know not as gigantic of a tower it is a pressure fed fabric material both for airflow channels and aesthetics to the backside panel has a small TG window to reveal three SSDs so if they are RGB they look awesome and they might add a tiny LED strip at the bottom of this window to illuminate this area if you are using non RGB SSDs which would be sweet there's that big side mount because of the available ventilation on the rear panel so you can install either fans here a radiator and you can install them on either side of the frame because there is enough clearance between the frame and the side panel and as for the interior there are four covers that kind of like basically block this area so you can either use it for SSD mounting or remove those four fan installation the i/o will be located in its usual position behind the front cover wood type C and a reset switch that you can reroute for the second system to be for power and the interior let's get into that now it is completely open basically so all the sort of you know four corners of the enclosure are within easy reach and it's not designed for your traditional systems really as the basement section is quite tall below the main motherboard tray for example you can install a second power supply for stacked HDD caddies which are included so you know if you want to go with storage focus system you can install an ITX system in here which is what you see now or fill it with a really thick radiator for push pools so they had an 8 even more radiator here and it still has plenty of clearance until you're you know your main ATX motherboard area now no optional kits are required for any of this mounting so you don't need to purchase an additional ITX mounting kit because everything is kind of built into the frame by default which is awesome and so this whole thing is very much water cooling ready and simultaneously at the same time you can do two 480 millimeter radiators so one at the front and one on the side and two 360 moving radiators one at the top and one at the bottom the motherboard tray is flat and wide for eb motherboard support those are those really gigantic dual socket int'l motherboards so a standard ATX motherboard looks kind of you know small inside this enclosure and what Phanteks is trying to do is develop an ecosystem where deluxe two is fully ready for dual systems where the revolt X power supply might come in handy and you know it's kind of your really enthusiast full tower where you either go with the dual system configuration or just go crazy water cooling and you know knowing and the user assembly that you get with a Phanteks of this type of caliber it is definitely going to be an enjoyable experience and in $189 I would say it is highly competitive and almost competes with fan tanks themselves and now the metallic gear series so it's powered by Phanteks if you guys recall with it the original sort of overview of the Neo line at Computex but now they've expanded that selection into a lower price territory so the Nevis island which has closed off side panel with noise dampening material applied on it $49 then we're moving on to the new air so it's a high airflow style case with a mesh front panel so you can see the the kind of the fans in on the interior $59 price point and the finally Neo G so it's more of a tempered glass Edition still has a little bit of spacing on the front so the airflow is not completely choked and they're going to modify the front panel for better airflow and I'm really excited to check out the Nira series Neo air near-silent and Neo G and this guy is 69 bucks alright good people so that is the Phanteks Luxe 2 I'm really liking the direction that they're taking you know incorporating elements from the original locks and the end - primo and really focusing on a feature set and you know it is not really competing with you evolv X because the evolv X is so premium it's got design elements and feature set whereas this is more towards the feature set so let us know what you think about this whole dual configuration for systems power supplies water cooling and what would you do with the luxe 2 if you are you know planning on doing something like that and do you guys like this whole fabric approach I love the texture and this new different direction but what do you think let us know in the comments thanks for watching we'll see you guys",

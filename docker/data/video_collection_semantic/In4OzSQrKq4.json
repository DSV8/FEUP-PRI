    "transcript": "- So October 2015, Sony releases the a7S II and the world goes crazy because it was a small, compact mirrorless camera, relatively affordable that could just destroy any camera in low light. And for years we here at LNG, we're using the a7S II as our daily driver camera, until we switched to our reds. Even 'til recently, nothing has really beaten the a7S II in terms of low light flexibility and performance, until today, because Sony after five long years has finally announced the a7S III. So let's begin. Funny thing is it's July 2020 right now, and cameras are just coming out left and right. We have the Canon R5 at the beginning of the month, we have the Black Magic URSA 12K that's coming and shipping in September, and then this camera. Okay, this box is a very nondescript. So I assume that this is not what you're going to get when it comes to factory packaging. This is a, I think a prototype model. And then they also sent along one of their tough 64 gigs Sony SD cards because the data rates on this thing are insane. And we will get into that in a second. Sony was gracious enough to send us a couple lenses for testing. I believe I requested a 2470 F2.8 and a 35, 1.4. Andy, are you ready? - [Andy] Oh yeah. - Let's see. This is basically a camera box. We have a little HDMI like table block thing. Not interesting. Okay, oh, you know what? I'm not gonna take care of it at first. I'm going to go through the rest of the box and then I'm going to take the camera out. So let's see what else in here. We have a power plug, a type C cable, 'cause this camera has type C, which is amazing. We have a battery. What else? We have a charger. I can't take that for granted. Fuji didn't include a charger in their camera. So like thank you, Sony for not being crazy and including a charger properly. A camera strap, which no one uses. And is everyone ready for this? Maybe I should do the sponsor spot first. And today's sponsor is PIA. PIA is the simple to use VPN that allows you to access services and websites as though you were in a different country. It encrypts all of your internet traffic and uses a safe, protected IP, connects up to five devices at once. Clients for Windows, Mac OS, Android, iOS, and Linux. Buy a one year plan for $39.95 and get two months free at the link in the video description. Sponsor spot over, here we go. Wow, I have our original a7S II right here and you can tell right off the bat that the grip has increased in size quite a bit, which I appreciate, 'cause again, on the a7S II, the grip was always a little bit on the small side. It was better than the a7S I. But besides that, I mean, when you look at the top of the camera, they haven't changed that much. There's a dedicated record button on the top of the camera. Look at this, top of the camera, dedicated record button. Look at the record button that was on this camera. It was on the side and it was like mushy and weird. I always remapped it to the shutter button just because that's way better. So on the back of the camera, you can tell they haven't drastically changed anything, but they have added very nice additions. The dial that's on the a7S II, which is like under the top of the camera, is now just like completely exposed. Again, the little things like this, where you can just kind of reach this dial from any angle. That's nice. Then the height adjustment of it makes it easier to access. They've also added a joystick and the a7S III has a touch screen. If you've been watching me unbox anything on short circuit recently, you'll know I am a very big fan of proper flip out screens. I think that was one of the biggest downfalls of the a7S II, is the monitor on the back of the camera was just not very flexible. You could do certain things with it, but it was just a pain to use. If you were able to build the camera up, if you were okay with that kind of setup, it was way nicer to always add your own monitor after the fact. They have fixed that and they added a proper flip out display. Look at that, full articulation. Canon has been using this screen design for awhile, Fuji followed suit. I was really happy when I saw that, and I'm also really happy that somebody he's doing it. These doors are nice. This door is not perfect, but the doors on the a7S II, they just kinda like flop there. Like they were so annoy, and they also flopped down. So then whenever you had something that like, whenever you had a cage or something near the camera on the side, it would get in the way because you just have these like two things hang there. Like I would love to have just cut these off. I should have just cut them off. Okay, so IO wise, we have a microphone jack, a headphone jack, type C nice. And then a micro USB and a full size HDMI. Now HTMI is not perfect, but when you compare it to the micro HDMI that was on the a7S II, I am very thankful that Sony made this adjustment. While I would have still preferred SDI, ultimately, this is still a mirrorless camera. It's a compact camera. I bet that there's a version of a camera that one day might exist that will have SDI in this form factor. You could argue that the Komodo is that camera, not quite the same thing, but guys, this HDMI port can output 16 bit raw. There isn't even an external recorder that can fully record 16 bit raw yet. I'm sure they'll come, but it's nice that Sony has designed this with the future in mind. And so when reporters come out that can take in that output, that's great. One of the coolest things that I saw in the spec sheet for this camera, and now that I'm finally seeing it in person I'm really excited about is that this camera has dual SD card slots, but not just dual SD card slots. It has dual CF express type A/SD card slots. You could have two SD cards or one SD card, one CF express type A or two CF express type A. That's a lot. Can someone come up with a better name for that card type, then CF Express type A? That essentially gives you the option to have two SDs, two Cfs, or interchange the two. Okay, let's talk about the sensor. There it is, full frame, 12 megapixel sensor, but it's significantly improved. The processor in the camera is eight times faster than the one in the a7S II. And the pixels themselves are larger, which just allows better dynamic range, lower noise, higher low light performance overall. And Sony has also done a lot of work on the actual sensor itself. They've basically changed the order in which they layer the sensor, which allows them to read data off the sensor faster. So when they pair that with the faster processor in this camera, you get the ability to have fatter codex because this camera can record up to 600 megabits per second. The ISO range on this camera, the maximum ISO is 409,600. You would never use an ISO that high. The fact that the sensor is capable of doing that is in itself amazing. I would have to admit that compared to other touchscreens on cameras that I've used, this feels not bad. The one thing I don't like right off the bat though, is that the menu button is the back button. So you have to press menu to go back. It's not preferred to do that though. I would have loved a back button like right here around the joystick area or the control dial area. The menu seems to also have improved significantly though, because again, if anyone has used a Sony menu, like the a7S II, this menu is a bit of a nightmare. Let's put a lens on this guy. So Sony sent the 35 1.4. This lens does not have image stabilization, but thankfully the camera itself has five stops of image stabilization. Let's put in one of these tough SD cards. Unable to use memory card slot one, huh, why? So we out the SD card issue we were having. We can't shoot at the highest bit rate 4k that this camera can shoot at, but we can still shoot at 4K, and I want to just do a quick focus test. Gianno is sitting behind the camera, so he's going to walk towards me. I'm rolling now. That looks pretty good. It looks like in terms of auto-focus, the R5 has quite the contender with this a7S III. There's Andy. Lens case. Andy, lens case. And there's very little hesitation. I just have to press and it goes for it. I've had the camera on for about five minutes now and I was just rolling, maybe three different clips just now and I can feel the camera is warm. Sony has stated that this camera can roll at 4K 60 FPS for a full hour with no overheating whatsoever. You're generally not rolling one single clip for an entire hour. So in theory, even as the camera starts to warm up, it should never overheat to the point where it turns itself off. S Log three typically has a minimum ISO, for example, the FX nine, when I was using the FX nine in S Log three, the minimum ISO you use on that camera is a thousand. So even with the built in ND, I needed more ND if I wanted to shoot it like F2, F 1.4. So I'm going to choose S Log three on here, and let's see if you're limited by ISO at all. Guys. What? I'm at ISO 160 in S log three S gamut cine. That is awesome. So you get the full benefit of S logs dynamic range and color profile with no downside, because now you have the choice to use whatever ISO you want from 160 and up, that's amazing. The rolling shutter that plagues the a7S II is not visible on the a7S III. The rolling shutter, I'm going to roll the camera right now. And I'm just going to like, shake it. Again, this is not a realistic use of a camera. You would never do this, but it does show you how good the rolling shutter can be. And I'm holding this handheld, not really being that careful about how steady I am, and it's pretty good guys. Knowing what the a7S II's rolling shutter looked like, even off of the EVF, this is significantly better. They fixed all the tiny little issues that were plaguing this camera. Like if you do travel vlogs and you wanna throw your camera out the window to get the scenery that's flying by, it doesn't have to look diagonal the entire time anymore. How great is that? It would be a disservice to you guys to not show you some footage, and we'll even try to include a download link so that you can see the clips for yourself. Even though this SD card can't record at the highest quality 4K that this camera offers, we are still with a 128 gig card only going to get an hour and 47 minutes of 4K off of this camera as it is right now. But the nice thing about that one hour and 47 minutes of 4K is that you could shoot it all in one clip because yes, this thing has no limit on the record time. So for anyone who has owned an a7S II, who still uses an a7S II, who wants a B cam that's small for an FX nine or even maybe a Venice in certain situations, Sony's finally delivered, five years later. Great auto focus, image stabilization, faster, better, low light, full frame sensor, 15 stops of dynamic range, and a body that is not much bigger than their other cameras in their lineup. Good job, Sony. I'm excited to review this, but for now, I'm really stoked that after five years, this camera is finally here. So I hope you guys enjoyed the video. If you have any other questions about the a7S III, I will hopefully, we'll answer them in the review. Let me know in the comments, if I should do a review on LTT. I probably will regardless, but you know, let me know if you think it's a good idea. See you guys later.",

    "transcript": "Can we just be honest with ourselves this thing is disgusting it's the nastiest case i've had to clean to date and i know i've said that quite a bit this season but there's a reason why i've saved this one for last this is the finale episode 10 of season 1 of pcdc thank you so much for your support throughout this playlist so far and don't worry there is a season two coming and we already have so many people lined up in the orlando florida area to have their systems cleaned you want to have your system cleaned and it looks anything like this here send my wife an email the details are in this video's description but my oh my this thing it's a whole lot of yuck now i knew today's video sponsor would come in handy be quiet sent us a dark power 12 this is an 850 watt unit which is supreme overkill from a wattage perspective for this kind of build here nonetheless he's gonna have plenty of breathing room ahead of him and one of the best things about this unit is that it's 80 plus titanium rated which means that you can run this thing at 100 watts load or 750 watts load it's going to stay extremely efficient all the way through the curve it is no small feat to get an 80 plus titanium rating and that's why these dark power 12 units are so special this unit in here is okay in its own i think it's balanced for the particular specifications of this build so far but it's caked in dust and not just dust but serious grime that will not come off with just air alone now i've said it before and i will say it again i don't like deep cleaning power supplies there's a reason why you'll never see me do it in this playlist because things in here can kill you there's enough amperage and some of these capacitors that don't effectively drain long term that can stop your heart okay it's not a game and if you don't want to take that extreme approach you can still damage the power supply or even worse than that damage other components when you go to reconnect the power supply and flip the power switch on right so it's just not a laughing matter no matter how you look at it when something gets this dirty just go ahead and replace it outright and what better product to replace it with than the dark power 12. this thing comes with a 10 year warranty folks that's a decade of peace of mind it's very hard to find those kinds of warranties in this industry now as for other upgrades his cpu cooler looks to be stock could definitely use one problem is a lot of tower coolers are too tall for this very slim case it leaves us with one of two options we can go with another low profile cpu cooler which is kind of what he already has or we could go with a very unconventional aio and that's where this comes into play this is an asetek aio but it uses a very very small radiator which actually fits perfectly here i think it's an 86 millimeter fan i might be wrong i'll put a little note here if i'm wrong but this is definitely smaller than the standard 120 or 140 ml mounts and it will fit perfectly back there so we'll replace his cooler with this we'll replace his power supply with this beefcake right here and i think that's where we're going to leave it i want to intentionally leave the case the case as is is pretty it's pretty old school it's also like a sleeper style build if we leave the case as is because it's going to have pretty beefy components in here and plenty of room to expand in the future thanks to this power supply so with that we're gonna take this thing outside first i'm gonna take my leaf blower to it i'm not even joking there's so much dust in here i'm gonna try to get as much loose dust as i can out of it outside i am not cleaning this thing in my office no chance at all so let's take it outside so now at this point we're on to day two everything is installed and wired save the graphics card and the power supply and this dark power 12 from be quiet has a few features worth noting including the inclusion of a silent wings fan with a frameless design which means this power supply is going to run extremely quiet it's virtually inaudible under load it's also extremely efficient again hence the 80 plus titanium rating and it's fully modular meaning you only have to install the cables that you really need meaning you can save space in compact builds like these this will be linked below if you want to check it out if you're upgrading to something like ampy or rdna2 those cards can be pretty power intensive and your 450 500 watt power supply might need an upgrade in that case in fact it more than likely will need an upgrade in that case unless your cpu just sips on power and i strongly recommend one of these units or something as efficient as this from the be quiet lineup for such an upgrade so let's get this brick installed it's going to be fairly tight in here and then after that we'll move on to the graphics card wire the remaining components up and make sure that this thing posts before we give it back to lewis all right so we're going to plug this thing in i believe everything is wired correctly and make sure that this post before we give it back to our viewer flip the switch on that was weird oh quite a bit going on in there sounds like it's working the pump seems to be working we should be getting a post here soon make sure the hdmi cable is plugged in sounds good all right there we go folks looking good i'm not sure if it's gonna know which drive to boot into probably not i think it wants us to hop into the bios but uh i'm gonna make sure let's see we got all the drives detected yep looks good yeah that's pretty much it that's about all i do in these um i don't really like to go through their systems um and many of you have been asking about running tests before and after uh you know the temperature delta before the dust is cleared and after honestly we've done similar things kind of off camera i've had dirty systems before that i've tested before and after and the differences weren't substantial that's why i never really made a dedicated video about it but i suppose since we've been dealing with such dirty systems now now we could revisit that maybe in a dedicated video and then if anyone asks about that in the future we can just link back to to that video instead of having to do this over and over because it would become redundant after a while and you would you would see very quickly that the temperature difference isn't as big as you'd probably expect given how much dust some of these systems have but anyway this system is good to go we're going to uh put the left side panel actually in this case it's the right side panel because this is an inverted build uh back on here and we'll give it back to lewis well i've got to say i have thoroughly enjoyed cleaning these systems over the past few months i know it doesn't sound like something one would enjoy uh but it has just been so i don't know personally fulfilling to see these systems transformed from what they used to be and in this case i mean this one looked so so bad the worst we've cleaned in this playlist so far but uh seeing the end result seeing how much cleaner it is and look it's not perfect i'm not saying that it's perfect but the case has blemishes that i can't get out with ipa or soap and water it's just not going to happen there are a few other things in here that i wish i could clean a bit more i just i cannot because of how the stainless steel for example has all these you know blemishes and things in it i can't get these things out but i can remove all of the dust i can do my best to get these looking as new as possible and then if i can also upgrade one or two things along the way i would like to give a big thanks again to be quiet for sponsoring this video for supplying us with this dark power 12 850 watt 80 plus titanium power supply for lewis's build i think it has transformed it not only giving him a viable upgrade path now he has plenty of power or wattage breathing room i should say for other upgrades in the future but it looks darn good i mean if i've ever seen a pretty power supply before this one is it so be sure to check out the dark power 12 linked below if you have a dirty system and you want it cleaned and you live in the central florida area um yes send my wife an email lisa at salazarstudios.org she has so many of these dirty builds in the queue already but it never hurts to have a few more and eventually we'll get to you assuming that your system is actually dirty enough uh to be worthy of a video on this playlist speaking of which season two is coming very soon there's not going to be a huge delay between seasons just because again we have so many to clean uh in this area which has been surprising i've been i'm very thankful for how many folks are willing to trust me with their systems for several days at a time i know it's not easy to see your precious system um you know leave your hands for any amount of time but uh i'm i'm very appreciative of those who have not only given us content i mean we're able to make videos with these builds but also just trusted me personally with cleaning these things up and not damaging anything which that would be awful but um i'm trying to be as careful as i can here as professional as possible and i'm trying to document all that for you guys here in this series so let me know in the comments down below what you thought of this series what you think of this video this build in particular and what you'd like to see in season two thank you all for watching be sure to subscribe if you haven't already leave a comment down below i just said that why am i saying that again give this video a thumbs up i would appreciate that and stay tuned for the next video my name is greg thanks for cleaning with me",

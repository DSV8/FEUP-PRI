    "transcript": "in this box is the best selling Graphics got on AliExpress apparently they've sold more than 10,000 of these which is a lot but unfortunately it's not very good and in today's video

brilliant for free for 30 days if you go to brilliant.org or scan the QR code or click the link down below and you'll also get 20% off a premium annual subscription with brilliant [Music] whoa there is no information on this box apparently we got a soyo dragon graphics card it's not even clear if it's an AMD or Nvidia graphics [Music] card oh yes nothing like a quality guarantee card with a technical support email address that looks like a teenager's first Hotmail account that's very reassuring although look at that Dragon water mark oo and then we have our very securely packaged graphics [Music] card oh what a beauty this is a soil look at that it has a very strong fake GTS 450 vibe to it but it doesn't have a mesic period port on the back so I think we're good and price-wise this very much makes sense for what it is but we we'll talk about that a bit later but as you can tell the heat sink is very rudimentary it's just a bit of aluminium that they cut some grooves in for increased surface area and then we have our little fan to cool it but this should be plenty cooling considering that this is an RX 550 a graphics card that's been out for a while in fact I'm pretty sure the Ottoman Empire was still a thing when this thing first came out and uh it wasn't particularly quick when it was first launched let alone 1,800 years later in fact the rx550 launched as an $80 graphics card at the bottom of amd's discret RX lineup there were a couple of OEM only cards that fell beneath it but it was pretty lame back in 2017 in fact this isn't even the full fat 640 SP version of the RX 550 it's a cut down one so I am very curious to see how it holds up with modern games now to test this graphics card that's more popular than a dermatologist in Fallout we need a system that has enough CPU power to keep up with the immense might of this little 550 and to do that I've got a ryzen 9 5900 x with 16 gigs of ddr4 at 3200 MHz [Music] okay so that's a good start we've got some video out uh now we just need to install drivers and then hopefully it's fine it was fine the driver install worked perfectly except for it very passive aggressively showing thumbnails of games we probably can't play on this graphics card loading into cs2s menus um that's not a great start this is 1080p low I think it's low did I change it oh no we're not at low yet that explains it okay never mind that's much better okay so once you load into the game it's going better than I was expecting considering the menu performance or experience ooh very big starter when it's not stuttering it feels pretty good like this is a usable Esports experience at 1080p low settings uh that occasional stutter is not great though okay so now that the system's settled down a bit and it's not stuttering as much the gaming experience has just crawled over that boundary of acceptable now with fortnite at 1080p low settings with epic draw distance while we're inside we're getting you know 60 frames per second it's it's borderline usable I I think it's the kind of thing that oh is it sorry I just had to clap some cheeks there um yeah it's it's usable as you can tell if you're playing against bots it you're going to be able to survive but but oh this is not great this really isn't great and fortnite is not a particularly demanding game and then as you can see our CPU is having to work its little butt off to keep up with the rx550 now with Dota 2 a game which I feel like I have to run on this graphics card cuz this is probably like sea DOTA the graphics card oh wow it is crushing it so even when lots of spells are happening it's it's fine like does drop down quite a bit but this is this is usable this is definitely a usable DOTA experience with pubg at 1080p with everything very low except far draw distance we're not getting a whole lot of frames here now again with pubg the performance with this graphics card is just on the border of acceptable it's been the case with all of the games so far yeah it's actually kind of impressive how the system just manages to skirt that line of unplay ability but at least the temperatures are Immaculate look at that but with that let's see what happens when we try something a little bit more demanding I can't imagine it's going to enjoy 1080p very much but who knows maybe it'll impress us uh no it it it doesn't enjoy it 16 frames per second isn't great and also it looks kind of funky almost like there's Fidelity effects or something on even though there isn't on that note let's turn it on and see how much that helps I'm going to go to balanced I mean it did 23 we are like uh oh we've got like an after image on the back of our car this graphics card and Fidelity FX don't get along very well so let's see what Ultra performance does hey would you look at that 30 whole frames per second it doesn't look great and it feels pretty terrible but it's a lot better than 15 so now that we've established that the best selling Graphics got on AliExpress is an Olympic tier athlete at minimum acceptable Esports performance I want to compare it to its own Big Brother an equally old graphics card the rx580 this is a cutdown version the 2048 SP and it's a card that you can readily Buy on AliExpress at the moment not even for that much more money than the RX 550 I'm curious to see how these compare although I'm not going to give this as an alternative graphics card cuz that price difference could still be prohibited to a lot of people so I have another graphics card I bought from AliExpress that costs a very similar amount to the 550 but should be a decent bit faster but first whoa that is a lot more frame rate I mean it makes complete sense it's like comparing a Spitfire to a right flyer but still that's a big difference ooh we're still getting big stutters occasionally though but aside from those this is much better than just minimally acceptable oh yeah now again with fortnite it's just running so much better we're getting about 100 to 120 frames per second I mean even with lots of particle jizz effects going on here it just drops to just under 100 with Dota 2 the difference wasn't as overtly humiliating as the first couple of deaths but when heavy particle effects started flying around it would dip a lot less on the rx580 pubg also felt wildly less minimum acceptable gaming performance which is good and then finally with cyber Punk at 1080p low again just so much more frame rate but the crazy thing to remember here is that these tests make the rx580 look like a beast but by today's standards this isn't good cyberpunk perform this isn't something to Aspire to even though it looks so much better than that RX 550 I'm also curious if the 580 takes the Fidelity FX a bit better it does we don't have that weird after image with balanced Fidelity effects so that's good so big surprise there an RX 580 is fast than an RX 550 but I still think it's a useful way to put the performance or lack thereof of the 550 into perspective so now let's see if I could find a graphics card that cost a similar amount to the 550 but performs better and the answer is well another soy graphics card which has the exact same box so let's hope this is actually a different graphics card oh good it is a different graphics card in fact it's an rx470 which I paid a very similar amount for as that RX 550 but this should performance-wise be much more in line with the RX 580 2048 SP variant than it would be with the rx550 lots of numbers said there which I guess means now we have to see how it performs oh would you look at that CS2 running about as well as it was running on the RX 580 this is 10 P CS2 and this is running about as well as you'd want it to run unlike with the RX 550 where it's minimum just bare minimum this is just wildly more playable than the RX 550 is the rx550 is kind of like a gt710 in that it's a graphics card that you use if you need video out not if you want gaming to happen whereas this handles gaming way better and the same was true for the other three games I tested as well all of them saw the little RX 550 abandoned Alone by the roadside like the least favorite sibling and considering that you can buy the 470 for a very similar amount depending on when you buy it to the 550 it's pretty hard to argue for buying that 550 maybe if you need a graphics card that doesn't require supplemental power so with that what did we learn in today's video well apparently AliExpress buyers really need to stop buying the RX 550 like what are you doing doing subscribe to the channel if you want more videos like this one and until the next video bye-bye [Music] [Music]",

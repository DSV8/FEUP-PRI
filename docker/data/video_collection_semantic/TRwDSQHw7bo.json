    "transcript": "do you all remember this video right here a few weeks ago we discussed a loot box website that looked super suspicious now at this point i'm sure you already know my feelings on the loot box business model itself i think it's gambling you're not going to be able to convince me otherwise just look up the definition of gambling and then look at what blue box websites do and you'll see how there's a lot of overlap there okay even if it's not legally called gambling in certain countries in certain states and certain whatevers who cares the fact is you're putting your money into something with no guaranteed outcome you're hoping that you get something better than the amount of money you put into it and most of the time you don't which means you lose money over time which means it can become very dangerous especially for those who are addicted to gambling or those kinds of activities and then when you bring kids into the equation it just i mean it's another can of worms i don't think i need to go into that anyway i bought a loot box from this hybe website that we more or less proved wasn't even the official hype.com and i was definitely scammed so here's my proof of payment i use paypal because i'm not an idiot i'm not going to throw my credit card at some random sketchy company it looks like it would just start it up in someone's basement i also have a an email that's not really tied to my business accounts so this would be a little harder to trace if they wanted to cross-reference things maybe they say oh we got this this youtube channel with 6 700 000 subscribers we want to send him a really good card so that all of his viewers feel like we're super legit and then we can scroll them over so that's why i did that uh and then it says payment 2 fan fan whoa fam i don't even know if that's a name or like in the name of a person named company who knows i've never seen that before and then the address which if if you had any doubts before that this was a scam here here you go and after weeks of waiting i finally received something in the mail to show for it i think you're going to thoroughly enjoy this video stay with me to get rid of that annoying activation watermark hop on over to vip std key and purchase a windows 10 pro oem key for fractions of the price of retail just use secure payment method like paypal receive your key in seconds and activate your os here bye bye watermark and be sure to use our new offer code skgs for a sweet discount right so let's cut straight to the point this is what i got in the mail yeah that's right here you can tell it's modern because it says windows 10 on it and has a a beautiful rendition of the witcher on the cover of the box and it says g4 series like you know it's bad when the box says nothing about the card inside like there's no indication on your at all of like what the name of the card is what siri like i don't even know what generation graphics card this is this is how you know it's a scam i'm going to give you a uh let's see there's the front of the box we've got the side another side another side and there's the back again still no indication what card this is we just know it's a g4 series card multimedia 3d graphic accelerator and a good old made in china so when i saw the box uh frankly i was surprised that they even bothered sending anything i actually discovered that a few days after making my purchase which cost over three hundred dollars their website went down this is what you run into now when you type in the kiki.com or however you say it t h k t-h-k-i-k-i dot com the site that was attempting to impersonate hype.com which is a a more legit but still scummy in my opinion loot box website and we'll get to the unboxing the graphics card here in a second i know you guys want to see what's inside although those who are familiar with these kinds of scams probably won't be all that surprised i do want to show you a few other things i noticed when i made the purchase itself so this here is the website's order confirmation page you can see it says hive at the top but this is remember the kiki.com this is not hive.com which is a bit more legit of a lootbox website but still not one i'd encourage you go to we've got an order id shipment status you can see that i paid and the total amount in us dollars was about 317 usd so um you know i paid a pretty penny for this this was the most expensive loot box they offered i would go back and show you live on their site in the box that i bought but again their site is down which is another indication that this was a big scam um yeah so i was a waiting shipment for a good while and i figured it was just never going to show up but sure enough it arrived it actually took only a few weeks to get here which i was kind of surprised by because i knew it was coming from an international country now the this country here had an address that some of you pointed out was actually coincidentally very close to sherlock holmes address 225 b baker street something like that this was like 2-2-1 baker street in england but uh yeah we we know at this point that this is not where the company was actually based out of this is the company in china and this address the address that this came from was a chinese address and i didn't think to do this in the original video i'm not sure why it didn't cross my mind but if you look up the domain itself you can see we've got the kiki.com here i mean this has china written all over it and i i mean that's not a it's not an inherently bad thing but if you're saying that your company is operating in england or the uk and you have a domain that's been registered in china or operating out of china then i mean where's you know what i mean like it just doesn't look good and i suppose this explains also why the card itself came from china and not from the uk where one would probably expect it to come from so here is what is in the box first off you got your graphics drivers if you get a box like this with a cd in it you know you were scammed you don't get cds and a lot of modern cards anymore it's all digital and yeah we've got this beautiful bubble wrap reveals actually a dual fan graphics card but those of you who've seen scams like this before know this graphics card is not what they say it is there's a sticker on the back let's see if the camera will pick it up so that says gtx 1050 ti right graphic gigabyte 128 bit ddr5 vga dvi pcie i don't think this is a 1050 ti first off this graphics card has definitely been used there was no indication on the website it's whether these cards would be used or new uh when they were shipped but if these were used for mining which i doubt because this card really is i mean this card sucks at money but if it was used for mining um then they probably wouldn't want to say that if that's where they're getting all of their cards for their loot boxes now a dead giveaway in my book that this is not a 10 series graphics card of any sort is the inclusion here of this vga port this is an analog connector and analog connections were dropped in 10 series cards so that's kind of impossible to have a native vga connection so uh we need to take this shroud off of here we're gonna look at the gpu die itself to see what this is one moment please and what do you know it is not a 1050 ti it's actually a gf116 gpu that means it's from the fermi family of graphics cards which means it is several several years old this is probably a gtx 550 ti folks and i'm not really surprised it's pretty common in scams like these it's kind of weird there's actually no engraving indicating what specific gpu this is there is writing on the top and bottom of the chip but nothing over the die itself which is yeah it's just weird usually you'd find that and if we did know what ship it was specifically we could tell you what card this was i plugged this in it does receive power it actually does work which i suppose that's kind of sort of a win but seeing as though i paid 300 bucks for this yeah i got rick rolled and actually look at this graphics driver version 382.33 on nvidia's website this dates back to s what is it september oh no may 22nd 2017. so four years old thereabouts and it just yeah it doesn't even match the graphic i don't know why they included this in here i mean like like what am i gonna do with this now here's the real kicker this is the part i really didn't expect and again this is one of the reasons why i like to use paypal for my purchases it's not a plug for paypal i'm going to sponsor this video but one of the good things about sites that use paypal even the ones that are super scummy is the fact that paypal almost always has your back and at the end of the day if you buy something that you feel like you got screwed over on more than likely you're gonna get your money back and it'll probably be back in your pocket sooner rather than later they tend to deal with the disputes on their side after the fact they'll just send you your money up front so a few weeks after hearing nothing back from the company about the status of the order whether or not the product had been shipped i decided to open a case on paypal and one of the reasons i did this was because the site went down like a few days after we ended up publishing our video so because the site went down i had no way to check the status of the order and i figured the site went down because they probably got busted somebody maybe i don't know and just they decided just to cut their losses they finally made one sale they made 317 bucks from a sucker like me and then they're like all right we're just gonna close the website down who knows it just again seemed very very suspicious i figured worst case paypal could look into it a bit it actually took paypal literally less than 24 hours to refund all 316.99 um and yeah that was that was pretty impressive so kudos to paypal for that didn't take them very long to sniff it out and realize something was was pretty messed up i don't know if paypal ended up recovering the funds from the company that i paid i doubt it frankly because again it's a company in china and i'm sure they already took those funds out of their accounts and they have no ties to paypal anymore but um at least i was able to get my money back and again one of the reasons why i always try to use paypal so hopefully this short little update video was at least entertaining to some extent i'm kind of surprised i received anything at all so i mean at least i have something to show for my purchase but at the end of the day it's still a massive rip-off i mean anything from the fermi architecture for 300 that's what i spent and i bought the most expensive box right they said i could win up to an rtx 3080 or 3090. of course i'm not going to win those things in the 300 by anyone who thinks that there's even a slight chance you could win something like that from from a site like this especially they're they're in la la land it's just it's not how these business models are set up the the entire point of a loot box website is to offset the odds in your favor that's how you make money otherwise you're losing money and at that point you might as well just call yourself charity a vast majority of people out there are in it to make money right they're in it to provide for themselves and for their families and in a way you have to respect that right i mean that's what we're all essentially working for is for money to do the things that we want to do to provide our families with the things that we need to provide them and you so i get it i mean that's why we all work but at the end of the day if you resort to this this kind of business model first off i think it's super scummy it's not illegal assuming you're abiding by the laws in your country and your state and your county that's fine you do what you can do but don't attempt to pass yourself off as something that you're not don't impersonate another company first off don't conflate the odds or flat out refuse to mention them which the kiki never did and that's that's how you knew again that you weren't going to receive anything of real notable value i mean a 550 ti in a co in a box that cost three hundred dollars they just made 200 plus us dollars on that trade by more than that these cards are really not worth much at all so again i'm not surprised that's how this goes and that's one of the reasons why i tell my viewers to stay away from loot boxes really at all costs i mean i know they're baked into games and things too and that's fine if it's like in-game credits and stuff cool but don't use your mom or dad's credit card don't use your own credit card if you're a grown adult to gamble on this stuff i mean you'd have better odds frankly in vegas and you'd probably have more fun so thanks for watching thanks for sticking around to hear how this played out yes i received something no it was not worth really anywhere near what i paid for it are we all that surprised no that's how loot box companies work that's why i recommend you stay away from them to some it's like okay well duh yeah but i got something right i mean it's it's a paper weight i can put it on the wall it would look kind of cool i mean it's something it's still technically a unicorn in this market but it's it's it's i would never use that in a regular build someone else could have it if you want to come pick it up you can do whatever you want with it but you're going to be disappointed you might as well just buy a gt 1030 to be completely honest and this will probably cost you the same because that's how ebay is nowadays with graphics cards and pretty much anything else that's in short supply that's all for this one thank you for watching my name is greg thanks for learning with me",

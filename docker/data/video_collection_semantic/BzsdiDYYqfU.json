    "transcript": "for today's video I bought a refurbished steam deck from valve to see if it's a good way to save money on some handheld gaming action also I've never seen a steam deck before so this was very exciting for me oo but before we get into that today's video is sponsored by Micro Center and they're Miami store opening tomorrow so go check it out they're going to have 20% off a whole bunch of Windows desktops and laptops and that's 20% off already good deals stocks are limited so hurry down and if you don't live in Miami don't worry Microcenter has enough deals online to go around and if you're not a PC Building expert you can use microcenter's PC Builder to help you choose compatible parts and then you can order them online and pick them up the next day check out Microcenter links down [Music] below I've been looking for a refurbished Steam deck from the steam site for months now but I haven't been lucky enough to find them in stock in fact stock is such an issue they even have an FAQ listing explaining why they're never in stock some nonsense about quality control or whatever in terms of versions they don't even offer a referb option of the OLED steam decks yet so unfortunately you have to go with the loser normal display but anyway eventually after waiting my whole life some stock of the 5 12 gig variant popped up which I could buy for $450 Canadian doll about 110 cat less than buying it new in fact the steam refurbs seem to be cheaper than most of the refurb options you can find on eBay so if the conditions as good as they're saying this seems like a pretty good deal so this is the steam deck that I bought from Steam and I'm very excited to check it out because I've not seen a steam deck in person before okay yeah that's correct oh no way it comes with a case that's pretty cool and I'm assuming this is the power brick with a companion cube yeah that is a power brick that you can clearly tell isn't brand new there are a couple of things on it that kind of give away the fact that this choni power supply is refurbished but I'm sure it'll function well at least I hope so so they designed a whole new sleeve for it so I'm going to pull it off like that ooh they lock the case with a little security tag presumably to keep the baddies out there is a feeling of use on this case it's clearly not a new thing that you're getting but if the condition of it good enough oo it's in really good condition uh although again you can kind of tell it's used wow ergonomically this was clearly designed for the human hand unlike the switch which was apparently designed for some pincered animal it also comes with a cleaning cloth that is pretty much all we get this is a really nice case I like it wo that is is a wildly sturdy feeling device like with a Nintendo switch when you do that with it it feels like you're about to break your very expensive toy but this I mean this feels like you could Savage someone with it that's cool I like that the build quality on this despite it being all plastic which I guess makes sense there aren't any Creeks or anything like that it seems like it's going to be pretty straightforward to take apart we've just got these screws and then I think the bottom bit should just pop off but we'll see we'll find that out before we do that uh let's plug it in and power it on firing it up for the first time was very exciting so many new sights and sounds but there was one thing that I kept coming back to oh it is ergonomically so much better than a switch the display kind of struggles with direct lighting I mean it makes sense in this context there's a huge Source here but still it's real shiny and on first impression I was real impressed with how easy Steam OS was to navigate I also like how it separates games that are good to play on the steam deck from the rest of your library although that did lead to a bit of a mistake on my part oh it's too early on a Monday for cuphead why did I do this to myself I then decided to try something more demanding to see what kind of performance overlay options it has and what kind of temperatures we get oh wow so you have four layers of performance overlay one gives you just frame rate up here and then four gives you wao that's so much information you can see see what each CPU core is doing and damn that actually it kind of looks like MSI After Burner that's almost too much information stage three actually seems like where we want to be cuz you can generally see what the GPU the CPU all of the memory is doing and you get a frame time graph with just a frame rate counter so yeah it's kind of all I'm looking for let's use this one in total we're getting about 10 to 11 wats of power draw and temperature- wise we're below 80 and after playing no man sky for a while those temperatures did climb a little bit so after a while of playing no man's Sky we're hovering around the mid to high 80s on the CPU I'm curious to see if repasting it's going to help considering that this is a refurb but there's a couple more games I want to try before I get to the tear down now a rat should and Clank the game is trying to keep us at around 30 frames per second and it's having to FSR real hard to get that but it makes sense it's a PS5 game and it's running on a handheld that's pretty impressive now apparently stick drift is a bit of an issue with the and on this refurbed unit the right stick there's a little bit of stickiness on this one it doesn't feel great but in all fness the game is running pretty sporadically so the kind of doubling down of inputs and stuff sometimes could be due to that so let's try it on a different game in halflife 2 the right stick also feels a little bit weird but that could be a setting issue maybe we'll have a closer look when we tear it down first there's a game I've always wanted to run on one of these let's give that a quick try now the fact that there even is a steam deck preset for cyberpunk meant that I've always wanted to try the game on this cuz it just feels stupid to run cyber Punk on something like this so let's see how it goes wa look at that we've got cyber Punk at a pretty stable 30 frames per second I mean there is fluctuation going on and a lot of motion blur wow uh but this is kind of playable to be honest I mean it's more playable than the performance we were getting off the Amazon's Choice gaming laptop from the previous video so that is very impressive I wouldn't play the game like this but it's cool that it can run it and honestly the temperatures and noise aren't that bad like this is kind of going pretty well and it's not even like all the settings are just the lowest they'll go I then decided to drop Fidelity FX from balanced to ultra performance ooh that's a much higher frame rate the CPU isn't happy with it though the moment that it went over 30 frames per second the CPU utilization jumped up a lot it honestly doesn't even look that bad because of how small the display is like yeah it's it's visible Fidelity FX but it looks better than the Fidelity FX on Ratchet and Clank did Okay so we've confirmed that our orphan steam deck is running fine temperatures are are decent I guess I mean they're pretty high but it makes sense for a device like this but now I am curious to open it up and have a closer look at what's going on inside of this device [Music] now we get to my favorite part which is tearing open and destroying the brand new thing that I just bought now it seems like we've just got normal Phillips head screws that holds the back [Music] on you can tell it's been opened before the screws definite kind of feeling of wear to them it's not terrible but it's it's noticeable oh oh okay that's a mistake move that a bit further away and then we can try again ah okay well it's its virginity clearly hasn't been D broken yet because that was ooh not a fun feeling process ooh look at that interior it looks so serviceable for example here's the back of the joysticks which are just held in by three screws and a ribbon cable and I know that there are a bunch of replacement options you can buy bu for these online and just swap in yourself I'm assuming the brain is under this silver bit with the heat sink poking out the top of it so let's open that up and have a closer [Music] look it doesn't want to let go up here cuz there's a screw hiding under a sticker and this should pop off now yeah there it is oh that's very interesting so this little metal cover makes thermal contact with the power delivery and in order to remove it you actually need take off one of the screws that holds the uh kind of like Apu heat sink in place that's very interesting but this little board is the entire brain of it which is really [Music] cool comes with a little bber m.2 SSD which was not quite as easy to access as I was expecting it to be but what can you do now I'm not going to be too worried about even pressure here because well we've already lost one of our corners of of pressure it's so tiny so first off our heat sink apparatus is very cute it's like a small bit of laptop heat sink underneath that lives our tinyy little Apu that powers our steam deck I mean that's pretty dry thermal paste and the final bit of tear down I want to do before seeing what difference a repaste makes was having a closer look at that right joystick I mean it's not a huge issue but there is a little bit of stickiness that the other joystick doesn't have in fact you can you can actually kind of hear the stickiness and with that I reassembled and repasted the steam deck to see if it made any difference to The Thermals okay so now let's see if I've broken it oh thank God and on first impression not only did I not break it but it seems like the repaste made a pretty big difference although this is right after I L launch the game so let's give it a [Music] minute okay well it's been a while and it's not made a huge difference but it's not nothing I think it's definitely running a bit cooler and honestly it's really quiet I can barely hear the theme deck so at the end of the day I think this referb is a pretty good way to save some money on a cool device when it's in stock once every 3 years which brings me to the end of the video thank you for watching in and until the next one bye-bye

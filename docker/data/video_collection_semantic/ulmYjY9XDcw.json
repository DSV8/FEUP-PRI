    "transcript": "- Okay, so I just got on Twitter, because, I mean, I basically am just on my phone all day long, clicking and scrolling, and mostly twirling on TikTok to be honest with you, but I got on Twitter, and I was like, \"What is this? emily?\" Bunch of other Tweets started pulling in saying that I hit 7 million subscribers on YouTube, which has been a long time in the making I feel like. I am so shocked. I just really wanted to make a quick little video and just say thank you guys so much for subscribing and supporting this journey. It's been long, it's been incredibly tough at times, there have been ups, there have been downs, there are some ups that you have seen, there's some downs that you've seen, there's been a lot of things that you haven't seen behind the scenes of just survival. And I think the past couple of years has been incredibly tough, for not only me, but many, many, many other people. I'm just so grateful that I still really enjoy what I'm doing. Like, I absolutely love making videos, I love creating, and I also love consuming other creators content because it just feels like it's such a welcoming place for the most part, at least in the circles and the content that I'm consuming. I'm just so grateful that you guys have given me that opportunity to just have a voice. And I was thinking back, and where I grew up in the middle of nowhere, and when I first discovered the internet and found other people like me that liked the things that I liked, and it just opened my eyes as a child, how much this world has to offer. And at the time, because I was very young, the internet was still in its infancy. So it has grown exponentially, for better or for worse. But the thing that I love so much is how much information is out there, how you can learn absolutely anything that you want online, and that is so powerful. I think knowledge and the freedom of knowledge is so important. For me, growing up, I struggled a lot in school. I just could not learn the way that other people learn. I still don't have that way of thinking that a lot of, I guess, your normal, neurotypical people are able to comprehend information, I can't do that, but with the internet and with different ways of learning, I can figure out what style I need, and I can find something to adapt the way that I need to learn or to read or to comprehend information. So I'm just so excited that a lot of you kids and even adults now, we're all in this world where we can learn anything, and the possibilities are absolutely endless. When people ask me how have I stayed on YouTube for so long, because I didn't quit, that's the only answer. Even over this past year, I haven't been producing as many videos as I normally do, and it's not really by choice, it's just, I've been going through a lot, a lot of health stuff, and finally, I'm feeling better again, I guess. And I feel like one of the things that people always see online is everyone sees the perfect things, they see the happy moments, you only see the good things, and we don't share those tough times. I love what I do, and I love to be able to tell stories, I love to be able to create. I'm just so happy that I am in a place, and it's taking me a very long time to get to this mindset to know that sometimes you, yourself, your mental health is more important than either producing a video, posting something on the internet. That is the first thing that you should take into account, because if you're not okay, you're not gonna be okay for your audience, you're not gonna be okay for your friends, you're not gonna be okay for your family. So taking care of yourself is one of the most important pieces of advice that I can give you. And whatever that looks like for you, you may not know at this current point in time, but that's something that I think as we go through life, you figure out ways to adapt to things that you need for you. And I think that's one of the most important things that you can do. I guess this is getting off topic, but I kind of wanted to give some advice, because I have been doing this for so long, and I feel like I've shared a lot with you guys. And for creators now getting into this space, it's overwhelming, it's daunting, and it can be a very detrimental place to your mental health. And I've seen it unfortunately happen to many of my friends who have stopped making YouTube videos because it was too much. The biggest thing is creating consistent content, but also knowing yourself and knowing how far you can push your limits, to when you need to stop, you need to take a break. Because I've been there, we've all been there, but at some point, enough is enough, and you have to take care of yourself. So I just wanted to end this by saying thank you, all. I mean, when we look back at some of my first videos, please don't, (Justine laughs) we started from the bottom, now we're here. It's been a fun journey, and I look forward to making many more memories. And now here's to, I was gonna say 10 million, but we have to get to 8 and then to 9 and then to 10, but don't worry, we'll get there eventually. Thank you guys for watching. Thank you for subscribing. I appreciate you all, and I look forward to seeing you in the next video. Bye. (laughs) (uplifting music)",

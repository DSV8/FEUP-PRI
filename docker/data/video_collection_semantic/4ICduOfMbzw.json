    "transcript": "- This scam company claims this piece of crap is an extremely high-tech $5,000 drone. All right, let's see how true that is. Sponsored by Linode. (upbeat techno music) Hey, everyone, how are you all doing? If you're new here, welcome. My name is Krazy Ken, and I didn't just buy one of these scam products, I bought two. Yeah, I don't have the other one here with me right now, but there's a good reason for that. I'll explain later. So I received many, many requests to look into this weird drone product that's been popping up all over the internet lately. Keep the submissions comin' you guys are great. So, let's investigate this $5,000 drone, and like usual, we'll start with the video ads. The ad starts off with a computer text-to-speech voiceover, which lasts throughout the whole ad. It starts off by saying this powerful $99 drone is now available in the US. And the narrator claims it's an extremely high-tech $5,000 drone while pointing to it multiple times. And he claims it was developed by Navy Seals so they could do stealth missions, and it uses some of the most advanced military technology in the world. And with this tech, you can take crystal clear and steady video footage. But, oh no, the drone was unavailable to the public because only one company owned the patent. But on December 15th, 2021, the patent expired. Yes, now, new companies could enter the market and start selling the drones to the public. 'Tis the American dream. But most companies are still charging $5,000? But thankfully, two former Navy Seals started their own company, and they're producing these drones at an affordable price. And they call it SkyQuad. And it has all of these epic features such as GPS, a Follow Me feature, which automatically tracks your movement while filming, and collision detection. And they claim it's the toughest quadcopter ever produced. So what are you waiting for? It's only 198 bucks, and if you click the button below, you'll get a one-time only 50% discount, so you can get it for $99. If you know me, you know I'm probably just waiting to unleash hell on this ad because there's so many things wrong with it. But don't touch that dial, there's a second one. This ad claims that this drone engineer, wait a minute, (laughs) wait, wait a minute. Did they just screen record another ad directly off of YouTube and reupload that? Yeah, that's exactly what they did. You can see the screen recording controls baked into the video, why? Anyway, the ad uses another text-to-speech voiceover, and it claims this drone engineer built a revolutionary drone at a low price. And he destroyed the billion dollar drone industry. The engineer, Thomas Rowell, used to work for a well-known drone company, but after the company got merged, there were big budget cuts and they wanted to outsource everything to China. So Thomas left the company and took matters into his own hands. He raised $3 million from investors so he could bring his drone product to the masses, and he called it QuadAir. But, oh no, more problems. The QuadAir sold out in 15 minutes. I guess I can't get one, episode over. Oh wait, the factory made more, whoo, crisis averted. And thankfully, the advertisers managed to get their hands on one. Wait, what do you mean you managed to get your hands on one? Was it that difficult to do that? I mean, you're selling this product, right? Don't you have an inventory? So did you catch everything wrong with these two ads? It's kind of like a game, right? Like \"CinemaSins\" or something. It's fun. So let's break these things down and see what's wrong, because there's a lot of things wrong. I'll start with the elephant in the room, and I'm sure many drone enthusiasts notice this. This thing looks nearly identical to a DJI Mavic. They even copied the yellow stripes. If a generic product is going through extra lengths to pretty much identically copy a name-brand product, that's a big no-no. Usually, that means the product is just gonna be really cheap and it's probably just a scam. They're just making it look this way to trick ya. Another problem is, any time a product has a backstory involving unnamed characters or characters with fake names, that's also a red flag. In this case, I'm referring to the two former Navy Seals. Also, this ad just straight up steals footage from other videos. This crash scene, for example, which my viewers pointed out, is stolen from one of WetalkUAV's videos. And the drone in that video wasn't even a SkyQuad drone, it was a DJI Mavic Mini. So in the scene, the advertisers are not even showing the real product. And that's just the beginning. There's inconsistent drone footage throughout this whole ad, showing a whole bunch of different products. For example, in the factory scene, you can see a DJI logo on the worker's uniform, and you can see the Mavic 2 logo on the drone. Also, the 3D rendering of the SkyQuad doesn't even show the brand name. It just says Quadcopter Drone. And in the second half of the ad, we see multiple shots of a product that looks identical to the SkyQuad drone, but the brand is Emotion Drone, what? More inconsistencies equals more red flags. So that's the SkyQuad ad. Now, time for QuadAir. This ad tells a similar backstory to the Navy Seal story, except it talks about an engineer named Thomas Rowell. And if you search that name, you won't find any link between Thomas Rowell and an R&D position at any drone company. But you will find a website for the Shadow X Drone. An identical looking product with yet another brand name. Oh my goodness, why are there so many identical products that have different brand names? Oh, you can just get 'em on AliExpress. That's what everyone's doing. Okay, I got it. How much are these worth? And that explains everything now. Yeah, congratulations. Your $5,000 drone which you paid 99 bucks for, is just $12! Stonks! Also, in this ad, we see more DJI branding, which doesn't align with the alleged QuadAir brand. This ad also makes claims about an HD camera. So, yeah, we'll test that later and see how true that is. In addition, the ad talks about how the drone stabilizes your flight automatically, and it uses clever programming to anticipate your flight behavior. Yeah, for $12, I highly doubt that. So before we test the product itself, let's take a look at their web presence, because this is where I found something that's really truly asinine. The website doesn't look too bad. It actually looks pleasing and professionally put together, which makes the scam easier to hide. And the website claims their drone is six times cheaper than the average drone, which yeah, is probably true. But when you cheap out, you're gonna get what you pay for. The features claim a 1080p camera, altitude holding, video recording, and longer battery life. And there's a 50% discount button with a warning, only 43 drones left in stock. I ordered these things two months ago and the discount is still active, and there's still 43 drones left in stock. Do the math on that one. And like the ads, the website touts the automatic stabilization for the drone camera. We've seen the stabilization feature come up several times, so here's what they're talking about specifically. Camera lenses and sensors can move very quickly, but subtly, to hide unwanted shakes and vibrations in footage. And this is useful for flying, because you will encounter vibrations from the propellers and wind. Oh look, customer reviews. I'm sure these are legit too. Dale B. says, the 1080 P is really cool. That's great, Dale, I'm so glad you like the 1080p. So here's where things get really fishy. Remember, there's two identical brands here, SkyQuad and QuadAir. Take a look at the QuadAir website. Looks familiar, doesn't it? Yeah, the QuadAir site is literally just a copy-paste of everything from the SkyQuad website, and it's probably hosted and maintained by the same people trying to make sales. Every image and piece of text is an exact copy, except the web designers did a find and replace for the word SkyQuad and swapped it with QuadAir, even in the customer reviews, which just further proves they're fake. Wait, SkyQuad is number one. No wait, Quad Air is number one too? These guys are just next level. Not only do they directly copy the competition, but they directly copy themselves. That's like S tier man. Like, how do you even get those skills? So with all of these fake claims on the website and in the video ads, you'd think I'd be smart enough not to buy one of these things, right? And you're correct. I didn't buy one, I bought two. And the other one is not here. It's actually with my friend, Dave, who is an FPV drone pilot. And he's gonna help me test this piece of crap. So what was the buying experience like? Let's have a look. Be cautious of the checkout page because it it automatically selects two drones instead of one. Those sly dogs trying to make more money. Well, that actually works out okay for me 'cause I needed two anyway. However, the checkout process was interrupted by my card's fraud detection. Gee, I wonder why. I overrode that and tried again. Oh look, a post transaction upsell. Oh, and another, and another, and another, and another, holy crap! Finally, the purchase process was complete (phone ding). Oop, sorry, I thought I turned on the silent switch. Why do I keep doing that? Wait a minute. How was your shopping experience? Answer our survey and receive a Yeti Tundra. I'm gonna tap on this and see what it is. Oh, cool, I've been selected to get an exclusive reward. Yeah, guys, this is all BS. Oh no, guys, while I was talking to you, the countdown timer was running this whole time. The offer is gonna expire in 3, 2, 1. (duck quacks) Oh, nevermind. Also, my favorite part of this survey is how they make it look like a Walmart page. They're using visuals of familiar brands to make the page look warm and safe, but it's all a trick. If you look closely, you'll see that it's not even the official Walmart Spark logo. The sparklets, that's the official name of those shapes, by the way, are misaligned and the corners are hard. The sparklets in the official Walmart logo are rounded. I know this stuff can be hard to spot, but if you can train your eye to identify a fake logo, that's a great way to determine that a website you're on or an email you're in is fraudulent. All right, let's take a look at the product itself, starting with the box. There's that Quadcopter Drone branding. No mention of SkyQuad anywhere. Good start. Drone 001, this is the first SkyQuad drone ever made? Wow, I feel pretty special. Record HD video with 120 degree vision. Yeah, again, this is a $12 product on AliExpress, so the components inside this thing are probably dirt cheap. Which means the camera sensor is very cheap and very small. The possibility of HD is very likely out the window, but a smaller camera sensor size means there's gonna be a higher crop factor, which means we're not gonna get that very nice wide 120 degree vision. Not the three sad onions, that one's for you, Ashens. Made in China, there's a surprise. Inside the box are the drone itself, the remote, some accessories, and the manual. First impressions of the drone were, yeah this thing feels really cheap. It has that nice China plastic smell. It just feels really thin, and squishy, and flimsy, and hollow, and it basically weighs nothing. But the light weight isn't always a bad thing. For starters, if you're gonna accidentally crash this thing, less mass here means there could be less damage to the drone and to other objects. So that's good. But there's another reason why it's light weight is good. You have to be under a certain weight limit so you don't have to register the drone with the FAA. In the US, according to FAA regulations, drones must be 0.55 pounds- 250 grams-or less. Once you cross that threshold, you must register your drone with the FAA, and a whole bunch of other regulations come into play. SkyQuad weighs 86 grams, so it's well within the limit. In fact, the remote weighs more than the drone itself. And upon looking at this thing, I just can't help but think, what was possibly going through the designer's heads. Because they sat down and intentionally took time to copy the Mavic design. And the only reason they would do that is to manipulate and trick people into buying their knockoff crap. And that is just kinda, well, let's just say it's a word that I'm probably not allowed to say here. The manual is also a little bit confusing. Thankfully it has pictures, but I'm guessing the up button makes it take off and the down button makes it go down. So I think they're, oh no, you don't. No, aw, turn off! You can't fly underground, that's probably an airspace violation. We're 10 stories underground, so that's Class Z airspace. Yeah, you can't fly there. Okay, so flying this thing indoors is probably not the greatest idea. There is a lot of drift. So let me call up my drone pilot friend and we'll go fly this thing outside where it's a little bit safer. (phone rings) Hey, Dave, you got your drones ready? - Absolutely, we're gonna compare the SkyQuad drone against my 2015 DJI Phantom 3 Professional, as well as some of my FPV drones. And yes, the SkyQuad is newer than the Phantom 3, and it claims to be based on $5,000 military technology. But does that make it automatically better? Probably not, but we shall see. - All right, beam me up, Scotty. (warp sound) - Man, I wish I had a teleporter. Vrooooooom (upbeat rock music) - [Ken] Wow, so now that we know what a real drone is capable of, let's dive into this wannabe. For starters, the drift is really bad on this drone. It's very hard to control. And there was also some lag with the remote which made the drone even more difficult to maneuver. But thankfully, it's lightweight and makes it durable against crashes, so, hey, we can continue having fun with it. With the WiFi on, we got about eight minutes of battery life on the 600 milliampere battery, but the drone does not warn you when the battery is getting low. Usually, a drone would beep or issue some sort of alert that the battery's running low, but this drone did not appear to do that. Oh no, it did? Oh, (beep). - [Dave] Yup. - Dave's Phantom 3 Pro, on the other hand, was much more easy to control, despite being older than the SkyQuad and not being built with alleged $5,000 military technology. Now we saw lots of claims about the amazing camera inside of the SkyQuad, so how well did that work out? Pretty crappy. This is the quality you can expect. Enjoy this. There's no onboard recording, there's no SSD, there's no SD card slot, nothing. It actually streams the video feed to your phone with an app called WiFi Cam, which could cause issues and quality problems because you're not recording locally, you're streaming all of the data to another device. And to no surprise, the quality is atrocious. The website and box advertised HD and 1080p, but it's way worse than that. Probably barely 480p. But the scammers tried to be sneaky. Their camera system encodes the video at 1440p, so it looks like you're getting a higher resolution clip. But in reality, the quality is barely standard definition. And there's lots of compression artifacts. Unlike what the ad say, there is no built-in stabilization. The footage is shaky and the rolling shutter is extremely high. So you see a lot of jiggly jello-ness with any type of fast movement. The Phantom 3 Pro, on the other hand, could shoot much better video quality, and it actually has stabilization, and 4K. And like you saw earlier, the angle of view is very narrow. It is nowhere near the claim of 120 degrees. And yeah, that results in very awkward looking video 'cause everything's really zoomed in. But also, if you're piloting the drone and you're using your phone as a screen to see what you're looking at from a distance, well, that's potentially dangerous and kind of challenging because you really can't see where you're flying very easily 'cause everything's zoomed in. It's kinda like having no peripheral vision. And best of all, you cannot tilt the camera remotely like you can on a normal drone. You have to physically move the camera with your finger and set it in place before you take off. 5,000 bucks, ladies and gentlemen. This is what this gets. (laughs) And that Follow Me feature, nope, doesn't exist. There's no GPS either. This is probably the worst scam product I've ever investigated. You know, things kind of fall on a spectrum, right? Like the Muama Ryoko. That product actually worked kind of okay, but the advertising was full of BS. But then you have some slightly better products like the Xtra-PC. The product's, overall, wasn't that great, but at least the advertisement was true. It wasn't lying about anything. And then you get crap like this, where not only are the ads full of false advertising, but the product itself also sucks. There are no redeeming qualities about SkyQuad or QuadAir. Don't waste your time with them. But something that is actually worth your time are the Linux cloud computing solutions from Linode. And believe me, they are way more stable than this drone. If you have an application or website that you need to scale and deploy, Linode has the infrastructure, and the 24/7 support you need. Linode offers out of box apps for game servers like TF2, CS:GO, and even Minecraft. You can run your own virtual private network with OpenVPN, build an online application with Joomla's content management system, or build a video streaming site with a multitude of app choices. There's so much you can do with Linode's affordable Linux virtual machines. And to boot, they offer award-winning 24/7 technical support. To put it simply, if it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode. Visit linode.com/computerclan, and click one of the signup buttons, and we'll give you a 60-day $100 credit just for watching this episode. And when you do that, you're also supporting the Computer Clan, so thank you very much. Thanks for recommending this drone to me. It was really fun to waste my money on it. (cries) But for real, I love doing this stuff. And, you know, most of the ideas I get for episodes come from viewer submissions. I just can't thank you enough for all of that. Keep it coming, I greatly appreciate it. And we'll see what happens next time. Catch the crazy and pass it on. (upbeat techno music) Fly away, Stanley, be free! (plastic crashing)",

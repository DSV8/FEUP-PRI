    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and I'm here with Ro. - Hello. - Okay, have you seen, it's a little bit outdated at this point, but the FaceApp? The filter where everybody was making themselves look old? - Oh my gosh, I saw that, but I never did it. - Well, there's all this crazy stuff and people were like, \"They're stealing your image, your data!\" Whatever, anyway. I mean, if you're using the internet, your data's being stolen. - Did you steal my data? You're going to sit me down and you tell me that you just stole my data? - Okay, you cloned my dog, so I'm stealing your data! - Okay, honestly though? You could steal my data. You can have it. - What we're gonna do today. - We're gonna use it 'cause you've already downloaded it. - I'm going to FaceApp our dogs and do like the age filters. I've been putting bangs on Matty and everyone thinks that they're real, so I'm gonna take a few pictures. Sit, you are sitting, okay. Good boy, come here, look here - Good boy, Matty! Look at the camera! - Look here! - Blueberry Muffin, sometimes it's Pooberry Muffin! - Okay, everyone, look here! - Hey, Cookie, right here, right here! That's my girl! - Okay, I think we got it. Here you go. - We didn't even plan this, we just showed up in tie-dye. - Yeah, we did not plan it. Ro surprised me with something. She cloned our dogs. (laughing) If you guys wanna see the video, I'll put a link in the description and an annotation. It's on her channel, you have to go see it. - I did this months ago, I didn't tell Justine and I honestly forgot about it and then it showed up in the mail and I was like (both gasping). - So, go check it out, I'm not gonna say anymore. It's incredible. This is gonna be great. - That's basically what my entire phone looks like. - I know. - Just all pictures of dogs. - I mean, now mine does too. Okay, I don't know if this is gonna work. I know it works for Matty. - He's digging. (laughs) - What are you doing? - They may smell something? - I think they're may be a pee-pee spot there. - Oh, Pooberry, is there really? - And now Matty is rolling in it. (laughs) Really getting in there on that spot. - [Rosanna] Oh, reeally getting in there. - This is great. It's so great because obviously when you do this with people, you can change your hairstyle (laughing) - [Rosanna] Oh my gosh, it does it. - It works so well. So, let's see what Matty looks like with makeup. - Oh no, oh no. (both laughing) - Bangs and makeup. This is Matty looking like oh! - Whoa, hot girl summer. Oh, that's evening look for hot girl summer. - Yes, this is when he goes out at night. (gasps) Oh my gosh. - Oh my goodness. - This looks like the Joker. Put smiles on people, so you can make them smile. - You have that friend that like, didn't smile in the photo. (Justine shrieks) (both laughing) - Wait till you see the teeth! - No! No, I don't even wanna look. (Justine shrieks) - Oh, stop, stop, stop! - [Justine] It is so-- - It looks look he has veneers! - I know, hold on, let's see it. - They're so white! - I know! - I mean, they're like, whiter than his hair. - [Justine] Yeah, but, can you even? - [Rosanna] Oh my gosh, that's a lot of teeth. - (laughing) Oh my gosh. - I love this 'cause it's so hard sometimes to get dogs to wear sunglasses. - Yeah, or smile with human teeth! - I mean, that's also hard. - Weird. - What's Cool Old, like? - I don't know. - Like I'm 80, but I have a little filler, like, what's Cool Old? - Maybe. I'm gonna have to try it on myself and see. So, this is what he looked like before. - There's before. - Yeah, I think it's just trying to wrinkle him up a little bit, you know? - [Rosanna] He looks a little drier. - Cookie's turn. (Rosanna gasps) - Get her face, - I hope it does. - Is it gonna get her face? Please, please, please. 'Cause so many apps-- - No, it says, \"We could not find a face in this photo\"! - Nooo! (groaning) - I really think it might be because Matty's hair looks like he's a woman. (laughing) You know what I mean? He has a womanly woman with him, like, a nice long haircut. - Oh my gosh, I have a wig. I'm gonna go get it. - You what!? - I've got a wig. If it needs hair, to think it's a human, I've got a wig. - Well, I guess while she's doing that, I'm gonna FaceApp myself as Grandma iJustine. That's my future. - Okay, you're a hot old lady. - Hey wassup! - Oh my gosh, you're so cute! - And this is what it looks like as just the old filter. You can also do the young filter, which doesn't really do that much. - You look the same! - Oh, there we go. Okay, that like, puffs your eyes out all weird? - Okay, you look like a different person. That's not the same. It's like your face got bigger. - It is really fascinating. Oh my gosh, that actually did a really good job. - Oh my gosh, can you make me a old lady? - Yeah! Look at my bangs! - (gasps) You look good with bangs! - Wow! Hello, I once had to cut bangs on myself because I broke a blood vessel in my eye and then had to hide it. It's so fun. - So you can see, like, what you'd look like-- - Whoa! - As like, really dark hair or like, what about unnatural hair colors? - Hmm, I don't know if it has like, it's mostly just like these colors. - Oh, like natural hair colors. - Yeah. Wow, okay, all right. - Oh no, no. - Wait, wait. - I'm creeped out already. I don't know if I-- - 'Cause if I wanna (laughter) - Oh my gosh, that's so stupid. - You look absurd! - Don't ever do this. - [Both] Whoa! - Hello, saucy! - What kind of beard would you rock if you were a dude? What kind of beard would you wear? - Um... - Would you do a goatee, with a little chin beard? Would you do a full beard? - Let's see. I feel, hmm. - Okay. - I think, maybe I'm kind of into the little hipster. - That's pretty good, I like that. It's mustache and beard. - Well, yeah. It's nice, that's nice. - With a little style at the bottom. Cookie, I love you very much, I'm sorry about this. - We don't even need the app. We've got real life. - This is your disguise. Cookie, this is your disguise. - She's beautiful. Okay. - Wait, oh gosh. (laughing) Yes, just lay! - This is amazing. - Lay there, nice! - Here it is. The photo that we have taken is it the ears? - Please work, please work, she's a person. - Nooo! - Dude! - I think that, I'm not sure, I don't understand. - So, this works for some dogs but not all dogs. - Yeah! I wonder if it'll pick up any faces from this one. - Yeah, let's see, let's see. This is so silly. - It's only with Matty's face! - It's so weird! I can't believe it. Now Matty has bangs. - Is Matty, like, not telling us something? Like, he's like, a little human? - He may be. - Are you like the Pokmon movie where there's a person inside you? The Pokmon movie, you haven't seen it? - I didn't see it! - Detective Pikachu! - No, I didn't see it! - I just ruined the whole movie for you! - And all of them! - Oh my gosh. (both laughing) I've got it on my Google Play. - Oh cool. - If you ever wanna watch it. - We could have movie night and you could spoil it again. - Oh my gosh. But there's more surprises than that. - Do you wanna tell us right now so we just don't even watch it? - Oh, no, no, no. Oh my god, oh my god. Wait, oh my gosh, can we make me an old lady? - Yes, yes, yes! - Before you end this video. - Okay, okay, okay. - I've got some terrible selfies on your phone now. You have the worst selfies on there. - Oh, but we are going to enhance them. - That's terrible. - We can make you smile! - Oh my gosh, look at that. - Oh, you didn't smile in your photo? - Look at that weird, what is that face? - I don't know, but hold on! - That's like when you don't know your camera's-- (laughing) That's terrible! - Look at you Cheesin'! - No! - Oh my god, I'm saving this. - Just no! - I'm saving it. I'm making this your photo, like when you call. - Please do, oh my god. - Like, small smile. - Okay. - Wait, oh my gosh. - Oh, that's big. I mean, my whole face is like. - This is my favorite, though. - Whoa. - Upset. (laughs) - See, that, oh my gosh. It's so great. Upset is just like that right amount of pout. You know, our food's not being delivered or something. - Yeah. So, let's do the Young 2 filter. - Why'd my eyebrows get bigger? - This just looks like, I don't know. Like you just. I don't like it. - I just look like they're brightening my face. - Yeah, I think that's all they're-- (screams) - Oh my gosh. - It's you, yes! Oh my gosh, this is our future! - I'm a cute old lady. - I love it! Look how cute you are! Let's do the Cool Old. - Ohh! - I can never really tell the difference, like maybe it just puts makeup on you? - Maybe a little splash of makeup? - I like, love this so much. - I love all the wrinkles and all the lines. I think that's really good, but she's really pink in the face and I just don't go outside as much as people think. I want a face tattoo. - Okay. Oh, yeah, that's really something. - That's so cool. What about the stars? Lightning bolt, like Harry Potter. - Tear drops? - Oh my god, send me the one with the lightning bolt I wanna be like Harry Potter so bad. - [Justine] Can you change the background? What does this do? - [Rosanna] You can? - [Justine] Oh, that did a really good job! - [Rosanna] What!? That was really cool, actually. Look, I'm Harry Potter in the city. - You are Harry Potter. - [Both] On the beach! - You wanna go too Venice? Yes. - You know what they need? Hogwarts Castle, they don't even have it! - Well, I don't-- - Look for a castle, Justine. Do they have anything that looks like a castle? A forest, a great big forest! - A castle might be behind you! Nightfall. - Creepy forest, that's it. I'm in the creepy forest that's by Hogwarts Castle. - This is amazing. - You guys know what I'm talking about, that's it. - That was the FaceApp. I am so glad you got to experience this because it's so silly. Thank you so much for being in my video. - Thanks for having me! This was great. - You guys have to go see the video we did on her channel, it's amazing. - Yeah. - And, again, cloning. There's cloning involved. - I surprised Justine. I told her about this like months ago and I was like, \"So, I did something\". And months later, it happened. - Go check it out. Click the link in the description, annotations, go subscribe to Ro's channel, if you're not already yet, of course. I have a huge playlist of all of our videos. - Oh yeah. - So, if you really, you know, have nothing to do for the next three days, feel free to watch all of those. - All of them? - Yep. - They're good. - We'll see you guys later! - [Both] Bye!

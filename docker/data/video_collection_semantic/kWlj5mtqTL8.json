    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine. And I am so excited about this video because today I'm unboxing the Goal Zero Yeti 1000 Core. And this thing is so incredible and so powerful. I've been using one of the really small versions of this, but this one can power so many things. Over here it says fridges, smokers, TVs, blenders, camera equipment, lights, personal electronics and more. This is quiet. It's gas free and it can also be charged with solar. And I'm such a huge fan of Goal Zero. They have so many amazing products. So huge thank you to Goal Zero for sponsoring this video. I can't wait to show you guys this. And then I'm actually gonna be taking this out and filming a podcast with my sister. And we're gonna be using this to power everything, our computers, our cameras. If we need a light, we're gonna use this to power the light. I can't wait for this mini-podcast adventure. Let's open this thing up. (lively music) Okay. I gotta stand up. Paperwork! Wow! Look at this. Oh, look at this. This is a cute little station here. We've got our charger. Before using or storing, plug your Goal Zero into the wall until it is fully charged. Keep your Goal Zero Yeti plugged in when not in use to ensure it's always ready. This will not cause harm to your battery. Oh, that's actually good to know. This has so many awesome ports on it for charging various devices. These are the two inputs that you can use to charge from Goal Zero solar panels or AC. Here we have our 12-volt outputs. We have our interactive buttons here and the LCD. So you have four USB ports. We have in and out USBC. We have two regular USBA and we have this 18 watt USB-C. We've also got these AC power, so you can power traditional things like your computer or a refrigerator or a coffee machine. I will definitely be finding use for these. Oh, and inside here, they even have an input for charging and even has a 12-volt output, as well. This is so great. So between solar, and if you have this plugged in directly to the wall, it can charge fully in about nine hours. They do have a 230-watt charger that can actually charge this within four and a half hours. Now let's unbox these solar panels. This is a really big box. I'm gonna put this on the ground. Wow, this can't even fit in my screen! Check this out. Wow, oh. (Justine chuckles) Wow! Okay. Look at this. Our little pouch here. This is what we connect to the Yeti. For best results, point your panel directly towards the sun. One would think that that would be a common sense thing but now you know. Whoa, look at this. Here it is. This is, oh my goodness. Look at these panels. This is so incredible. We have four panels here. I feel like I could power my entire house with this. All right, so clearly I can't set this up in my house because it is meant to be outside. So I'm gonna go set this up and start off on our podcast adventure. (lively music) So we're here at the location, and we're gonna start setting up for our podcast. But the first thing that I'm gonna do is get those solar panels all set up, so that we can start making sure that everything is fully charged. I mean, this entire device is gonna be powering everything that we're doing today. Our podcast equipment, the cameras, our phones in case they need to be charged. So these are the solar panels I didn't really get a chance to check these out in the studio. So you guys are experiencing this firsthand. I love that this is all folds up so nicely. (lively electronic music) Look at that! That means we are getting power. (lively electronic music) So you don't necessarily need to use this light right now, but I just want to test this out to make sure that one day when we do need to use it and power it's gonna work. Okay, Jen here you go. - [Jen] Okay. - Plugging in. - [Jen] This is a nice light. - It's so nice. I love it. All right. Oh my gosh, it's on! - [Jen] We don't even need to stay for sunset. (energetic music) - Oh, it's so bright! - [Jen] I feel like 50%. - Really? That's so bright. It actually feels like the sun. Oh my goodness. Wow. Okay. That's good to know for future when we actually need a light. Oh my God. It's so bright. Turn it off! (mellow electronic music) The sun is already shifting. So by the time we start recording, the sun is probably gonna be about this angle. So let's move these a little bit, Jen. Just so we can get maximum sun coverage. (mellow electronic music) So this is the real test. Will it be able to power our podcasting gear? Oh, it's on! It's on! - Podcast is all set up. Looks good, sounds good. We're charged up. This is great. - Yeah, can you hear me? - Yeah, I can hear you. - So I said it sounded good. - When we started this podcast, like this is what we wanted to do. We wanted to go out in nature, have adventures. And now that we have this, like we can. - Yeah, I feel like we were really limited to like being in a car and close to a car with extension cords and cables. But we're good now like we're basically in a lake. Oh! - We- - Will we ever do a boat podcast? - We could. It's like, it's almost like limitless. Like as long as we can like pick this thing up, take it somewhere. And it's charged and with solar panels, like our options have been expanded. - The world is our oyster. - Do you remember when we did one car podcast and we didn't realize that the car sometimes would shut off. - Yes, I remember that. - And then- - I remember oh, we lost all the audio, I think. - Yep. - Great times and we're not gonna have that problem anymore. - We're not. - Anywhere where we have sun or we've got a charged up Yeti, we're good to go. - I know. I'm very excited, but Goal Zero is awesome. They have so many cool products. I got you that smaller one. It was the 900. - I know. I know. - It's great. - Actually- - I get to go on an adventure now. - But it's so funny, 'cause I use that to just charge my phone. Like anytime I'm like, I don't even use an outlet. I just like pick that up and I use it. - Well, it's good to have because you never know with like, there's been a lot of weird weather and weird things happening. - Right. Like I feel it's just a good thing to have charged all the time in your home in case of emergencies. - Yeah, that's it. We did it. If you want to listen to the full podcast, check out our YouTube channel, youtube.com/samebrain. You can also find us basically everywhere that podcasts are like a thing. - We also have personal channels, but that's what you're on. - Yeah. - Well I have a personal channel. Don't go there. - No, go check out Jenna. Anyway, I'll see you guys in the next video. I hope you guys enjoyed this, I will put a link in the description. If you want to check out more incredible Goal Zero products and the Goal Zero 1000 Core Yeti that we're using right now. It's so cool. - Can I plug my body into it to charge me up? - I don't think that the lawyers would like that. - Okay. It was a joke. - Yeah, she's joking. It's a joke. Okay, we'll see you later. Bye! (mellow electronic music)",

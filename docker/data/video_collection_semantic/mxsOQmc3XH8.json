    "transcript": "- Hey guys, how's it going? It's Justine. And today, I am going to be showing you this really cool iPhone case. I don't have it on my phone yet. Obviously, it's still in the box. But, there's an Indiegogo campaign going on for this case. And, it is a minimalist case. It is called the Mod-3 Radius X case. And, it's not really a case. It's more kind of like a little skeleton, shell-type, thing. Because it's not out yet, this is a pre-production release. So, they sent me this to try out on my phone. I had one of these a long time ago. I don't remember which iPhone it was. But, I loved it so much. It just looks so good. You also have to screw it into place. So, it's not something that you can just take off easily. It's going to be quite the process. Wish me luck. And hopefully, it works out well. Since this is sort of a pre-release version, it may not fit perfectly as the final one. But, I think that we're going to be okay. So, let's open it up. (package rustling) Oh, that was a lot easier than I thought. I think I was making it more difficult. (package rustling) So, here's our directions. It's probably going to be pretty simple. Whoa! This is it! (upbeat dance music) This is going to look so great on my phone. I cannot wait. Oh my goodness! Okay. Let's check our directions here. We've got teeny tiny, little screws. This looks fairly simple. So, we remove this piece first. I'm shaking because I had so much coffee. So, if you're wondering if I'm okay, I think so. (giggles) This, on top of here. (upbeat dance music) I dropped the screw. Do you know how small it is? I was concerned that this could potentially be a piece of dust. This is so small. It is stuck underneath my fingernail. Okay, let's get this together. So, I probably was supposed to put this on first. And, it looks like it's fitting perfectly. So, we screw this back into place. And, that's it. I thought it was going to be a little bit more difficult. But, that was, incredibly simple. And, oh my gosh. It looks beautiful. I'm so happy right now. T-minus how many days until I shatter my iPhone? Because I have not shattered it yet. And, I'm super proud of that. So, I'm hoping that it doesn't happen. But, I am so reckless. (upbeat dance music) I am, so excited. I think I'm actually speechless. I just wanted to show you guys this, because I thought it was really great. And, I thought that a lot of you guys may be into it as well. Let me know what you guys think, in the comments below. And, are there any other similar iPhone cases, like this, that you'd like to see me test out. And, if anyone out there is making cool iPhone cases, please let me know. Because, it's so much fun to be able to test them out. And, show you guys some of the cool things that are out there. Because, there's so much stuff, that it is completely overwhelming when you're looking for a case. I still don't think it's a case. I cannot say this is an iPhone case. This is like an art piece. It is a piece of jewelry. Kind of like that crazy $1400 case, that I had. Or, $1200. Whatever. Super expensive. But, it was a piece of jewelry for your phone. And, yeah. I mean this, looks good. You can't even tell me that this doesn't look great. Because this looks amazing. I will see you guys in my next video. Thank you so much for watching. Sorry this was so short. I thought that this was going to be a more complex thing. And, I'd probably run into more issues. But, surprise! No issues. And, it fits perfectly. How long before I shatter my phone? Not that I'd like to know. I think it's okay. But, I. Oh man. So, I had just shot the video, talking about this new iPhone case. And, I was like, well I wonder how long it's, (smartphone repeating Justine) Well, I didn't shatter it. But, I did drop it. It hasn't even been two hours. (upbeat dance music)",

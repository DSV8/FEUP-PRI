    "transcript": "The Triple Camera smartphone from Huawei the P20 Pro. It barely survived my durability test. The screen shattered while the phone while the phone was being flexed, unfortunately. But, it still functions. Now it's time to tear it down, review it from the inside, and see the hardware behind those 3 camera units. Let's get started. [Intro] Heat is mandatory for opening the back glass panel on the Huawei P20 Pro. This thing is ip67 water resistant, and glued down pretty tight. Luckily heat softens the adhesive and allows us to slip a metal pry tool in there to slice under the glass and remove the sticky stuff. It's incredibly tight though, and a lot harder than it looks. The big suction cup does help out. I'll link the tools that I'm using in the description. One thing to watch out for is to not slice too deep into the phone. The adhesive is only around the edges, and there is a fragile ribbon cable next to the camera lenses, which I'll show you in a second. It looks like there might be some pull tabs attached to the adhesive along the sides, but I'm not sure how you would access these without removing the glass panel first anyway. The tabs might be there to help during the installation procedure instead of the removal. I'll unplug this small sensor from the motherboard with a plastic pry tool. The sensor fits right between the two camera lenses and probably helps with the auto focus. To get a better look at the triple rear cameras, we're going to need to pull off the protective plastics around the main board. The top plastic section is attached to the black NFC pad flopping around. Similar to what we saw on the translucent HTC phone. This one just isn't as aesthetic, since it's not meant to be seen...except for by me and all of you. There are 8 Phillips head screws surrounding the top edge of the phone. And once those are off, I can peel off the plastics and the NFC pad to reveal the motherboard. I'll unplug the charging port connector like a little Lego, and the smaller battery plug. And the display ribbon, which I'll talk more about in a second. There are also 2 antenna wires holding over on the right side, and then the whole motherboard can just lift out. Just seeing if you guys are paying attention. The SIM card tray obviously needs to be removed first. Nice catch guys. It's got a red rubber ring around the edge to help keep water out. It goes hand in hand with that ip67 rating. The motherboard is now free. We got some purplish thermal paste plopped in the center of the phone. This thermal paste uses the aluminum metal of the frame to help keep the processor cool. It's time to look at these triple cameras. There is some copper shielding tape over the connectors. I'll peel that off and unclip the 2 connectors going to the 3 sensors and pull it away from the board. And here we are, an 8 megapixel telephoto lens up top, a 40 megapixel sensor in the middle, and a 20 megapixel black and white sensor at the bottom. It looks like the only sensor with OIS, optical image stabilization, is the top telephoto lens. The other 2 don't have any hardware stabilizing. The slight movement of the lens is probably just the focusing mechanism. It's pretty cool to see all of these lenses side by side. You can see how far the telephoto lens protrudes out the top. Personally I think it would be cool to swap out the monochrome lens for a wide-angle, but I'm sure that will come out soon enough on a future phone. I'll clip the two camera connectors back onto the motherboard. And do you remember that circular earpiece grille I mentioned during the durability test? Well the speaker under that grille is actually rectangular, which is pretty normal for inside a cellphone. It's just interesting that they decided to go circular with the grille on the front. That's unique...and I think kind of cool looking. The charging port on the P20 Pro is pretty interesting. I'll have to remove 10 screws along the bottom of the phone to get access to it. But once the top plastics are off, I can pull the incredibly small USB-C port from the bottom of the phone. It has that same rubber sealing ring that the SIM card tray has, but it's not red. I think more things should be red, personally. The little circuit board at the bottom pops out next, followed quickly by the loud speaker. This speaker doesn't have any water resistant meshing built into the part itself. It's actually down here at the bottom of the phone on the frame. We get all the mesh, and look, red rubber this time. Perfect. The circular vibrator motor seems to be pretty small on the P20 Pro. It's probably about 1/5th the size of an iPhone vibrator. It still works though. You don't need a big vibrator to get the job done. For the battery, this 4,000 milliamp hour beast is pretty large. But, there are no magical pull tabs like the ones we see inside of iPhones. And the adhesive is not gentle, this stuff is permanent, which is unfortunate because once you bend the battery like this, removing it, it becomes incredibly unsafe. The internal layers of the battery are wrapped up like a roll of paper towels, and if the layers touch, or compress into each other, it starts on fire. Like we learned with the Note 7. So it's super lame that Huawei is using permanent adhesive under their battery because if you ever need to do a screen replacement, the battery has to come out. The only way to access the screen display ribbon is under the battery, and now the battery is unsafe to really reuse again because of that bend-age we inflicted earlier trying to remove it. Continuing with the screen, it is glued permanently onto the metal frame, so a screen replacement would require a lot of heat and prying to get rid of the old glass and display panel. It's kind of a pain, but I'll link replacements in the video description. Now it's time to see if it all works when I put it back together. I'll get the battery back into place. It's honestly probably going to work just fine even after the removal abuse. But still, magic pull tabs would have made things way easier. I'll get the loud speaker back into place. Then I can plop the USB-C port into it's slot between the loud speaker and the little tiny circuit board. Then I can plug the charging port into the circuit board like a little Lego. Pro tip: you can magnetize your screwdriver bits on top of the loud speaker magnet inside of most cellphones. You can use an earpiece as well. I'll use that little trick to get the 10 Phillips head screws back into place, holding down the bottom plastics and components. It's kind of like rocket surgery for ants. There's a whole lot going on down here. The motherboard is next goopy side down. I'm making sure no wires or cables get caught under the board as everything gets put back into place. Once the board is secure and clipped in, I can plug in the black and white wire cables, the screen connector next to the built in LED flash, the charging port ribbon, the front camera up top, and finally, the battery connector itself. I'll get the protective black shielding over the top of the components, and finish it off with those 8 Phillips head screws. The last thing we plug in is the lazer auto focus, and the back panel can go back into place, with new adhesive of course. The whole thing won't be water resistant anymore, but if any of your glass was cracked like mine was, that was already compromised anyway. [Phone turning on sounds.] And it works. Another successful teardown. It's always impressive how much abuse these phones can handle and still function. This P20 Pro is a trooper. Come hang out with me on Twitter and Instagram, and hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. It's totally free. Thanks a ton for watching, I'll see you around.",

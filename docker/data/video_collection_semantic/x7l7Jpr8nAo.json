    "transcript": "- Today we are checking out the new Pixel 3A, this is the XL version and this is the color Purple-ish. This comes in two other colors, there's clearly white and just black and this is the XL version which has a six inch screen and the 3A has a 5.6 inch screen. There is a bit of price difference as well, the XL version is 479 and the 3A, which is the smaller version is 399. But what's crazy about this is I think that this may potentially be one of my most favorite budget smart phones. And its crazy that we throw this word budget around because phones now are getting so incredibly expensive. What your paying for a phone is what we pay for computers, that's crazy! So for this phone to be under $500 and still have everything that you would need and want, especially an incredible camera, is super exciting. Not only for me but for all of you guys who are looking to get a new phone. I know, I know, this is coming from iJustine, one of the biggest Apple fan girls there is but I again, always do have a second device which is an Android phone. And today, that second phone is going to be the Pixel 3A XL. Get outta here! Oops! (gasps) oh wow! It looks so pretty! The Purple-ish Ooh it's so smooth, another way that they're making this more affordable is by not making it have an all glass back, so it does have this more plastic feel, so it does make it feel super light, like this is so light! I love this neon button, this is a great color. While this is turning on, lets talk about some of the specs. So the rear camera shoots 12.2 megapixels, you can shoot 4K 30, and then you can shoot 1080P up to 120 frames, 720 up to 240. The front camera is 8 megapixels and basically only shoots 1080P, 30 frames a second. It features Qualcomm Snapdragon 660, 4 gigs of RAM and 64 gigs of storage. The battery life on the 3A XL is a 3700 mAh battery and the 3A is only 3000 mAh. It does have fast charge but unfortunately it doesn't have wireless charging and I'm so used to having wireless charging everything now, that to have to a phone that doesn't have it, its kind of sad, I'm like, please charge. It also has USB-C ends, of course, a headphone jack. So now, were gonna set this up and then we'll test it out. Oh jeez, oh god I can't be trusted, I can't be trusted! (upbeat music) My favorite part of any new phone review is the camera test. Right now I'm filming on the Google Pixel 3A XL, which is over here. And this is the iPhone XS Max, so we're gonna go out, take some photos, take some videos and (child screaming) There's a lot of children around so just, we'll try to get outta their way. (upbeat music) This is really good content, I think I have a new channel. I just stream? Front facing test! Over here iPhone, over here Pixel XL, If you guys think I'm gonna put this yerbe mate for you, you are wrong! Look at these ducks. One of the things I like testing out is what do the cameras look like in different lighting situations so right now I am in the shade, but as I move into the light, how does it adjust? Does it adjust quickly? Does it not adjust quickly? (upbeat music) So now its time to take some selfies, one of the things that I love so much about the Pixel phone is the front facing camera has a really great wide angle lens so I'm gonna take two pictures here, first on the Pixel, and then one on the iPhone. These lens are pretty much the same distance from each other but that wide angle view gives you so much more to work with. So now I'm gonna zoom in on the Pixel. So let's do a front facing portrait, iPhone portrait. Can you zoom with a portrait? That's interesting! Okay, that's so zoomed. That's actually really cool! I mean this is probably gonna be my new profile picture! (laughs) I'm still surprised at how well that managed to do, zoomed in wow, good job. Good job goog. - [Camerman] Do you want me to take back camera portraits? - Yeah, I don't think I can do it myself. (upbeat music) Wow, okay the color seems a lot more vibrant than this one. Seems to be a few more artifacts here, okay iPhone did a pretty good job too. I mean honestly, what drives me crazy is we sit here and we nitpick the smallest, tiniest things, both of these cameras are beyond incredible and honestly most of the phones you get today, you're gonna have a decent enough camera I sometimes think I'm driving myself crazy by just trying to go in and find out which one is better in which situation. I don't know, is this, which one is better? What do you guys think? Maybe we tried like a brighter light situation. Imagine if my eyes were open. I'm falling over! There you go. I'm falling over again! - [Cameraman] I got it right as you were falling. - Yeah definitely more contrast in the Pixel and it stills looks a little light, a little more washed out in the iPhone shot. But if I adjust this though it'll be perfect, so if I go in here I adjust that black point a little and the contrast, yeah now, its perfect. What I do like is you have a lot more to work with there. I love taking panorama's so lets take one here and see how it looks. It's processing. I'm in such suspense! Okay I guess while that processes, lets take one on here. So the iPhone pano processed immediately, the google one took a few seconds. I can't really tell cause these screens are super small so I'm gonna put them up here and let me know what you guys think, which one do you like more? Pixel or iPhone? It's not quite dark yet so as soon as the sun goes down I'm gonna take a few night shots with the Pixel and the iPhone because one of the things that I'm so excited about and was so impressed with the previous Pixel was the night shot. So now we're testing out night site, since it's finally dark. So I'm gonna be testing it with and without night site so you guys can see what it looks like with and without. (upbeat music) Actually, this shot that I got here was also taken using night shot. This is one of my favorite photos that I took last year, it was of the moon rising over the mountains and it was so amazing. The only phone that I had was my iPhone and the Pixel but look how incredible this turned out. One of the things that I love is AR and there is a little playground here in the camera app, you can add different types of AR things like this little cheeseburger that I have just dropped in the middle of the street! And if I hold this down I can record a video. Okay, oh! Oh he's going, where are you going? Are you running away from me? Oh my god, he's close to your foot! (laughs) I'm making him dance! Oh my god, he is something else! Can you see that? What I'm seeing? Its not really there. Now let me make a little video of them. In the future, this is what we're gonna see, things that aren't really there. There's little pets, there's Japanese phrases, there are so many! This is wild! You guys better be following me on Instagram, cause it's about to get wild. So that's a quick little look at the new Pixel 3A up against the iPhone XS Max. I've really been enjoying this phone so far, it's only been a few days but I look forward to testing it out a little bit more, especially testing out some of the phones that have come out this year. There's already been so many that it's extremely overwhelming. I'd love to know from you guys, what phone has been your favorite this year? And what phone are you looking forward to that's releasing later this year? That's it for me, that's it for you cause its the end of the video. So, have fun (laughs) Have a good day. Carry on!

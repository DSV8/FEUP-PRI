    "transcript": "- Move the mic around a little bit, maybe I'll fall it a little bit, be up here. Absolute mayhem, but I'm gonna bring it all to you. That's my job. (sexy electronic rock) - [Voiceover] The unbelievable technology. - What's up, guys, Lew here, and as you can tell, I am on the show floor at CES 2016. It's incredible, there are human beings everywhere. They all wanna see what is hot, what is new, what is fresh like pizza. I'm in a Ford booth right now, and there is a lot happening in here from a tech perspective. But there's something that catches your attention the moment that you step into this booth, and it's over there. It's bright, it's yellow. That, my friends, is the new Ford GT. I wanna, I wanna share some of this really sophisticated stuff with you real quick, just before we talk about that. Behind me, this is obviously an autonomous driving setup. And you can see on the top, those fancy things spinnin' around there, those babies are shootin' lasers out. Millions, in fact. This car can map space 3D, as you'll see on the displays up there. It can see all those human beings, so you can tell how tall they are, starting with green down at their feet level, and then all the way up to, to pink at their head, so the car's interpreting exactly what that object is, and it's doing so at real time by driving around a space first and building a layer, let's call it a layer. And then, within that layer, you've got sort of the baseline for what that street looks like. When you come back around the next time, it can then create this new layer in real time for objects in that path that weren't there before. This is where all the magic happens, or at least some of the magic. Painting this picture, it's building this map, and, essentially, it's learning how to become a better driver than you are. I know. That's the future. You're not driving anymore. You're gonna be in the backseat sleeping. If you're like Jack you might be doin' other things. The next thing I wanna show you is a little bit different, this is something that's available now, and I'm pretty sure you're all gonna want, so let's head over there. Tell me when you got it locked. Tell me when Monopoly looks beautiful. Let's get a profile. We looked at autonomous vehicles over there. It's not somethin' you can buy right now, unfortunately, but here, we finally have Apple CarPlay and Android Auto living in harmony with Sync 3. I think you can tell that I'm excited. Can you tell that I'm excited? No reason to be glancing at your device while you're trying to drive. Please, eyes on the road, people. I just like that. Oh my goodness, that is my phone in my vehicle on my nice big display. But the whole idea here is to take all of those things that you do on your device that you shouldn't be doing while you're driving and pairing it down to a nice, easy to use interface. Say I go back to Sync, I can still use Sync, and I can boot into Android Auto when I wanna use it. But what it remembers is my preference. It remembers that I wanna use Google Maps, so even though I'm in Sync, if I click on Maps, which now took over that icon, I'm goin' to Google Maps. Choice. It's about choice. Who doesn't want choice? I want choice. Jack, you want choice? Mike, you want choice? Christian, choice? There we go. Everyone agrees. It's time to talk a little bit about that thing, the brand new Ford GT. Unbelievable. That thing is made completely of carbon fiber. It's a legitimate race car. This thing will be on the track in a configuration very similar to what you're looking at. This vehicle has Gorilla Glass for a windshield. Never mind your phone. Gorilla Glass in front of your eyeballs when you're driving. Super limited. Write a little letter to Ford and tell 'em why this belongs in your driveway. And your little trips to Starbucks, they're not gonna cut it. Everything on this design is about air flow, sending it through to various channels. You get a car like this, I think you, I don't know, you might instantly become a superhero, I'm not sure. I think that's the way it works. I mean I think, I feel like I could just stare at it. Look at this, see how the rear lights there, they're actually carved out for air flow. You see that? Every car is gonna basically be custom configured for you. The seat inside actually doesn't move, so the driving dynamics remain the same, no matter who the driver is. Instead, the steering wheel and other components come towards you. All right, there you have it, guys. A quick little look around the Ford booth here at CES 2016. Some future tech we showed you, Android Auto or Apple CarPlay and Sync 3 in all 2017 models, and then we showed you the vehicle that I wanna leave this place with. We showed you the Ford GT. Hope you guys liked it. If you did, make sure to leave a thumbs up down below, and I'll catch you very shortly. More stuff from here, the show floor. CES 2016. Don't miss it. (sexy electronic rock)",

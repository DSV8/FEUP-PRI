    "description": "(  _  ) Todays Mystery Video -   Nival Travel Laundry -   Is pocket washing the future of clean clothes or does it suck?   More info from the manufacturer -  Doing laundry can many times be a burden, as wash-only clothes and garments need special care. And what happens when travelers are on a trip and no washing machine is available?  Behold Nival, a game-changing portable washer to help clean your clothes, protects delicates from damage, saves 60 times energy, and gets laundry done easier with less hassles.   Delicate clothing is the greatest concern of the laundry world. One mistake can bring your favorite garments to badly stretched or destroyed stuff.   But look at this, what would be worse than wasting an evening washing clothes by hand?  To solve this, Nival utilizes the powerful transducer to automate scrubbing clothes, passively help detach all traces of contamination: dirt, oil, dust, grease, pigments thoroughly in a gentle way.   It protects delicates from damage from a conventional washing machine. Just 30 to 40 minutes, rinse your clothes, hang up to dry, you will be able to dress up your favorite garments the next day.  Unpack suitcase, do laundry and return suitcase to closet for the next time trip: those post-trip tips no longer apply.   Nival helps you stay tidy and comfortable during traveling. No hassles returning with loads of dreaded clothes.   Nival has a built-in powerful transducer in the chamber. It induces high pressure waves at hand-wash frequency, which generates cavitation bubbles to agitate a liquid. The agitation produces high forces on contaminants adhering to clothes and it is also able to penetrate microfibers to thoroughly detach contamination like dirt, oil, dust, grease, pigments, etc.   FOLLOW ME IN THESE PLACES FOR UPDATES Twitter -  Facebook -  Instagram -  Google Plus -",

    "transcript": "So today I've got an unusual gadget for you Well, you see um ... ga it bleh It arrived just like this this is what it looks like in this little bag - what exactly is that? I did a little bit more research and I found out that it's part of an Indiegogo campaign right now and this little guy is your very own washing machine that fits in your pocket, the pocket washing machine this thing is supposed to travel with you, clean your clothes all you need is a bucket of water, or in their indiegogo video they're just using the sink This, and a little bit if soap, and apparently, you're washing away your sorrows I got a few diffrent things here there's some mustard Some ketchup And then I've got some soap Now in their Indiegogo campaign They sell their very own soap But, I'm gonna go ahead and use Tide 'cause thats what I have available to me Now, the idea here, you got a USB cable and it plugs into a power source Then you dip this guy Into the water Along with your clothing that you're attempting to wash And supposedly This thing rattles and, somehow your clothes after about 20 minutes I don't know. I'm very skeptical Very very skeptical to be honest We're gonna find out If this little pocket washer Is any good? So let's go ahead, and stain a t-shirt real quick, So you see I got some, classic Hanes t-shirts over here. White as well, which as you know is the most unforgiving t-shirt colour Get a little bit of mustard, a little bit of ketchup on there Hey, I guess you could get this on a white shirt, I mean, I don't know who wears a plain white shirt, but it's possible Ohh It's already Oh my goodness, Okay This could be- This could be trouble, we're 'bout to find out Some Mustard there, I'm gonna shake this for- You know what's the worst with the ketchup? When If you don't do the shake, and then you get the weird, almost ketchup juice that comes outta there. Ohhhhhhh That's a lot Okay Well, obviously you're not gonna do this, unless you're some kinda, barbarian. I don't know, do we rub it in a little bit? Ohhh, man Let's see it Ooooh! That's no good That's not gonna be good Okay Ohh That's Alright Ohh- Kay Getting soapy in here! Alright, so I put a little bit of liquid soap in here. I think the powder, or the little tablets probably work better. I'm gonna drop it in And maybe I'll just put a little more soap just for good measure. You've got your shirt in here, you've got the unit in there. (Vibration) Ohh! I don't know if you guys can pick that up, What it's doing But it's like some kinda, micro Vibrations There's little, tiny bubbles Shooting out of this unit And it's vibrating really rapidly From what I read online This now, Will be in here for, 'Bout 20 minutes? (Dramatic Sting) I don't think you're supposed to swish I don't think it's supposed to do the job Uh, I mean If I look really closely you can see movement, like little micro-movements in the water all over the place. Emergency situation You need that special shirt You messed it up Throw it in the sink along with this thing A little bit of soap and- Magic (Dramatic Sting) It's doin' somethin' (Dramatic Sting) (Water being blown by unit) (Dramatic Sting) waiting (Chuckling) Man (Chuckling) I don't know 'bout all this (Water being blown by unit) Ho! (Dramatic Sting) Well I don't know , what's there is what ever you left there. I don't know shelves, the various shelves and the plates (Dramatic Sting) I'm not sure that we were fair to have checked. I just don't know that we were fair. (taps container) How long ? (Dramatic Sting) I got to say this shirt still looks pretty horrendous. hohoho to be fair I don't think for real intent here is to..... deal with a shirt that's been.. abused in such a way? Just a lot of thing here on Unbox Therapy, but we got to the extreme and soo i threw everything at it including my makeshift kitchen sink. The what I ... you see, everything but the (points at makeshift sink) Uhhh ... this is gonna be to like freshen up a shirt or something, you know, you need to wear while you are traveling you didn't bring enough of clothes unexpectedly. This thing's always in your bag so.. I mean that smells like a clean shirt so to speak and then you just hang it up to dry. I don't think I can go so far as to say that is sucks. It is not a replacement for your washer/dryer combo the full size thing alright? I mean there's just not as much movement happening. This thing is is like a vibrator for a bucket you know? If you think it's useful in some way to you? so long as you don't want to drench yourself in ketchup and mustard, I'll have a link to it down in the description but um ... me personally I'm gonna stick to the big boy units. (tongue click) (Dramatic Sting)",

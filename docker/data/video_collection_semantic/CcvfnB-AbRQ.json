    "transcript": "- What's up gamers? OnePlus is back with a new OnePlus 11 5G. Which right off the bat, I gotta say, I don't think we need to put 5G in the naming anymore. Like most new phones are 5G and you're not gonna use it anyways. You don't have 5G, let me just say that right now. We also have the new earbuds, which James is gonna be covering, so make sure check that out. But today we're focusing purely on the new phone, which is exciting. It's the latest flagship for OnePlus and, you know, the last ones have been creeping up in price and the performance has been good but maybe not quite what the major competitors do. But I'm excited to take a look at this and we do have some labs results so make sure to stay tuned for that. But first let's take a look at the box. Wow, 11, what a great number. At the bottom here we have OnePlus X Hasselblad. And if you don't know, Hasselblad is a German camera company. Their camera, interesting fact for you, was the first one on the moon. Do with that information as you will. Otherwise on the back we just have the specs and everything like that. In front of us, we have these 16 gig 256 in green, which is a great color. So let's get in here and take a look. Right off the bat there we got this nice, never settle, I'm guessing, what's holding the sim card and booklet here? Oh, okay. No, it's, it's supposed to, I think it's supposed to rip. I don't know. That's awful. Inside here an OTG adapter. So that'd be the USB-C to USB-A, so that's for switching things over from your old phone or plugging in accessories. Safety guides that no ones reads. And a lot of stickers. Ooh, I'll make sure to give this to Alex Clark. He'll be so excited. Although we got all this, we don't have a phone case like we did in the Pocophone. Very disappointing, you know, I have high expectations now if $160 phone can have a phone case, this one should too. All right, we have the phone but we're gonna put this off to the side. Oh. Okay, we're gonna put off to the side for a second as we look at it what else is in the box here. This is a thick box which means I'm thinking it has a charger in here. Oh and it does and it's even the American ones. This isn't just a EU standard thing. This is a, we love our customers thing. And we got here a 100 watt max SUPERVOOC charger. SUPERVOOC! Which can do 1 to 50% in just 10 minutes and it can charge up to a 100% in 25 minutes. That's pretty fast speeds. I don't charge my phone overnight cause I want my battery to last as long as possible so I can keep my phones for longer and something like this would be great. Throw it on the charger when you're in the shower, get out, you already had enough charge for the day. Sounds great. We also have the classic red USB-A to USB-C charger. It's a weird plastic, it almost feels like a plaster scene. Like it's kind of tacky, like it keeps its form very strong. No fun colors. Right off the bat, we'll know it's an in-screen fingerprint scanner as it does have the little warning here to use official screen protectors only. And then getting in here we have the phone itself. Yeah, and this phone is looking really good. So it's a 6.7 inch screen so it's you know standard like the 7 Pro or the, you know S 23 plus kind of thing. But man this is really pretty. I'm not a huge fan of the curve screens on phones. Like I really like the flat look of like my iPhone but it's a good balance between that form fitting shape in your hand while still also having that kind of fall off infinity screen. And then on the back we have the somewhat controversial camera bump. So it's quite large. It kinda looks like a, like a razor, like a shaver. I dunno what they're called. I, I don't shave but I think it looks really slick. And this design they've stolen from Samsung where the camera bumps kind of bleeds in from the metal rail does look really good. This color's also really nice. It's like a slate. It's very flat and it matches the industrial look of the phone. On the right hand side of the phone we have the notification slider, so that'd be whether the ringer's on, on vibrate, or completely off. I love this. I wish more phones had this the iPhone has the silent or the ringer. It'd be cool to have a vibrate, completely silent, or ringer like this does, but many phones don't have it at all and I think that's just a wasted opportunity. And then we have our lock button or assistant button or whatever you use it for. On the top here we have a microphone as well as just a mystery hole. I don't know, I doubt it's a speaker but try putting stuff in there. I don't know. On the other side here we have the volume rocker and again more antenna lines. And on the bottom we have our SIM tray, microphone, USB-C, and speakers. I'm just gonna check and see if this SIM tray is a dual SIM or not because I do believe it does support dual SIM. It just might be E-SIM, oh here we go. So it is two physical SIMs, which is actually my preference. I find it a lot easier than trying to get the E-SIM switched around, but that might just be Canadian carriers making things difficult. No SD card expansion or anything like most flagships, unfortunately. Other than that, before we get into there. It is decently heavy. Like if I compare it to a Pixel 7 Pro here, definitely still feels lighter like it's glass and stainless steel but it doesn't feel anything too crazy. It's got a good balance to it, again. Maybe a little bit top heavy with the camera bump, but again, nothing too noticeable. It's just like that normal flag chip foam weight. And you can see on the green there it is starting to get a little bit finger printy and even on the camera bump itself, the camera bump does have a bit of a kind of sparkle texture to it. The front of the phone is pretty standard for just a glass, you know, screen. It's gonna get fingerprints. There is a built-in screen protector on this one but you're gonna get fingerprints on your screen if you're like me. But just put it in outta your pocket or just smear your phone in your LTT store desk pad and everything will be all right. Well you get mad at me when I do it. No, don't show the B cam on this. All right, last thing do is turn it on. But first let me turn you on to our sponsor Secret Lab. Thanks to Secret Lab for sponsoring today's video. Secret Lab chairs are engineered to keep you incredibly comfortable for long hours at work and play. Their Titan EVO 2022 chairs keep you feeling comfortable for longer. It has four-way lumbar support and ultra comfortable line of different seat materials and more. All chairs come with up to a five-year extended warranty and a 49 day return policy. So head to the link in the description and check out Secret Lab today. If I don't lift it up, it's not broken. Man, right off the bat, the bezel on this thing looks great. So it's 6.7 inch screen as I said earlier, it's a 1440 Q HD plus 120 hertz super fluid ammo LED LTPO 3 screen. - Wow! - Yeah, it's got everything. What that means is obviously it's AMOLED, it's gonna look great, blacks are black, but LTPO means that it can go from 120 hertz all the way down to one herz. So it's only gonna refresh one frame a second. So like you're always on screen or when you're reading an e-book you'll barely be using any batteries 'cause instead of refreshing at 60 frames a second, it'll only be doing one frame a second. So that's great. Brightness on the screen's decent, it gets to 500 nits when you're just turning it up to its max but it can go up to 800 nits in auto mode and 1300 all (bleep) day. But it can go up to 800 in auto mode when it knows you're outside and 1300 nits peak brightness when you're watching HDR constant or anything like that. And this phone does have HDR. So it has HDR 10 plus as well as Dolby vision. So things should look good and we'll take a look at that later. As for OS, so it's running oxygen OS based on Android 13 so it should be, you know, pretty modern of what you would get with Pixel or anything like that. Oxygen OS is pretty minimal, doesn't have any huge, huge quirks or anything like that and blue wear is pretty minimal. We've installed some stuff on here so what you're seeing on screen isn't you know what you're gonna get outta the box. But yeah, it feels good. Lots of different settings for changing things to customize it from the way you like it. Myself, I like gestures, I like dark mode I want that full QHD plus screen instead of the lowered resolution that gives you a little bit longer battery. But yeah, it's pretty minimal. So let's take a look at something a little bit more important and take a look at the camera. Alright, so for cameras we have our main 50 megapixel 24 millimeter wide main camera, which has optical image image stabilization and face detection, auto focus. Again, things that are pretty standard on flagships. Then we have our 48 megapixel ultra wide so that's 115 degrees. That's gonna be quite wide. I actually really like ultra wide so I'm excited to take a look at that one. And then we have our 32 megapixel telephoto and that is a two x shooters that should look pretty good. Again if you use telephotos, great. I myself don't take a ton of zoomed in photos on my phone. Alright, we've got a camera open here and the UI is the same as every other phone so let's just get right into taking some pictures. Wow, there's 1x, 2x, 0.6 looking good. So this one goes all the way up to 20x. Oh wow. He's really, he's really going for it. Oh wow. Look at him. And I like the little preview gives you as well so you can see the whole frame as if you weren't zoomed in 20 times. I should have been taking a video though. Is there stuff going on? And man, the colors look really good. There isn't a ton of distortion like the lines look pretty straight. I noticed zooming in, the suede textures of the stuffies and pillows do look a little odd and the colors a little bit off but the colors are pretty consistent and again off camera it is quite dark so there's not a huge loss of quality or sharpness going out the farther away it gets into the darkness. It doesn't seem to be trying to lift up the shadows too much and overexposing in different areas because of that. It just looks like a strong all around photo that for something that I just kind of flipped around took a photo of, looks good. This is a cool feature. I don't know if this has been in OnePlus phones forever or anything like that, but being able to just rotate your thumbs and rotate the photo. Super convenient. James tried with his Pixel and it does not do that, so thumbs up for a cool feature there. The phone does AK at 24 FPSs 4K at 30 and 60 fps and then 10 80 p up to 240 FPSs. You have a lot of different options there. Wow, it's, wow, can even switch to the ultra wide. You can't see that in a lot of phones. It has trouble switching between the lenses but that's, that's pretty convenient. And again, the shake test, who's that guy? - Hey. - Shake test, pretty good. It doesn't feel like you can really tell that I'm shaking the phone back and forth. Video looks pretty good. You can tell a little bit when it's switching between the lenses. There's a little bit of a hesitation as it's changing between them, but it was pretty smooth. Again, not something that every phone can do and the mic is okay. I feel my voice is a little bit tinny in it especially somebody who has a deeper voice but I don't think it's that bad at all. All right, now we're gonna be taking a selfie. Is it? Oh, that's a video. I think I look a little over sharpened my beard hairs are very pronounced but hey it's a thing. Going to try moving around to get different lighting here and see how it exposes. It does keep my face very consistently lit which will be nice for video calls or anything like that. But again, it's not the most appealing looking video. Alright, let's take a photo this time something more purposeful but first I gotta check to make sure there's no AI settings on like they're in the Poco phone. Natural. Nose? Okay, let me take a no, don't change skin texture to zero but it looks like it is even the natural one it is doing things. All the meters are showing that there's something on so I'm just gonna try flicking it all off. Shame on you. Feels gross to have things like cheek and nose reducers on by default. People probably won't go through all of these options to turn them off. The photo definitely looks a lot less sharp now. Though, my beard does still have kinda like a weird HDR effect. I'm gonna try turning that off as well. Yeah, no, just not a great selfie shooter. For someone with a hole punch, you have the excuse of having to shoot through a screen. I will give it this, after looking at the photo it looks like the preview that you see when you're about to take a photo is way sharper but then just smooths everything down after take the picture, which I tried to turn off. So, disappointed, to say the least. And for RAM we have 16 gigs plus 4 you'll notice, which is kinda like the Poco phone, whereas a kind of a RAM expansion mode where it saves some of your files into the flash storage of your phone itself. And then we'll access it as if it were RAM on your phone. Some people in the Poco video were concerned that wears out your storage so maybe you'll wanna turn it off. You cann expand it up to 12 gigs, which is insane. I don't know why you'd ever need 28 gigs of RAM. It's a child's phone. This is a phone for men. Since this has the new Snap dragon in it we sent it over Labs to see what they think about it. So Labs was super impressed with this phone. The OnePlus 11 is 17.5% faster at cold launching games, which means they're not in the background on average compared to the Pixel 7 Pro and is 12.5% faster recalling them from the background than the Pixel 7 Pro and gameplay is rock solid. It stays in line with other major flagships at a solid 60 FPSs in most games. And max quality settings, where applicable, with the exception of Diablo Mortal. So they think there's an optimization issue as it doesn't line up with most other devices that they tested. On the heat side of things thermals were also handled very well. 20 minutes of PUBG mobile with Max Graphics only saw a 4 degree increase in temperatures for the CPU and a 5 degree increase on the GPU. We don't have any sort of official range for labs but they said it was really good thermals on top of all of that. The 5,000 millionth power battery also was an extremely strong performer. Labs estimated to be over eight hours of Genshin Impact when playing at max graphic settings on a full charge and up to 12 and a half hours for PUBG mobile and COD mobile. Insane. Finish him. A lot of the performance probably chalked up to the new Hyper Boost gaming engine which OnePlus says uses machine learning to stabilize frame rates and find an ideal balance of power consumption and performance by learning and adapting to the user's game. Whatever that means. Oh, a fingerprint scanner. Alright, I'm going to try setting up the fingerprint scanner here. One thing I am disappointed about already is it doesn't have the cute smiley face from that Poco phone. This guy's cool, I guess. As I've said before I am a fan of the in displays fingerprint scanner. I know some people say they have performance issues with it but I don't seem to have a problem. All right, let's see how fast this is. Not bad. Crab rave time. I ironically like crab rave. You heard it here first. I like crab rave. (music playing) That sounds pretty good. It has a very wide sound stage. This earpiece does get quite loud. A lot of time you'll see dual speakers and then you put this up to your ear and it's playing it like a quarter of the volume as the main speaker. This one feels really well balanced. Let's compare it to the Pixel 7 Pro. I'm on my personal YouTube, crab rave is the top result. (music playing) Wow, those speakers are really good. They get really loud. I think this is probably the worst, the Pixel 7 Pro. Then when you compare the OnePlus to the iPhone. The iPhone has that issue I was talking about earlier where it's way louder out the main speaker than it is the earpiece. So it doesn't have that wideness that the OnePlus has and it doesn't have the volume. Can't believe I'm saying it, but I think this this is beating out the iPhone on speaker quality but screen quality looks great, very clear, very bright. It's definitely got like a vibrancy mode on so things look pretty colorful but there's usually settings for things like that so you can tone it to exactly the way you like it. Now for the most important part, price. So when OnePlus started, they shook the industry by being flagship killers at an accessible price. But as you can see, prices have kind of started to grow with OnePlus phones a lot. And the OnePlus 11 5G starts at $699.99 US. And you might be saying that's still very expensive and yes it is, but when you compare that to the Pixel 7 Pro, which is $900 and the iPhone 14 Pro which is a thousand, and the Galaxy 23, which is $799. So you're saving a couple hundred bucks when compared to those other alternatives. And look at the screen being really quite good, the speaker's being awesome, the battery life lasting quite a long time and the camera being pretty decent. Whoa, it's me in the future. I know this is a little odd we don't do reviews or anything here, but I took the OnePlus 11 with me to San Francisco for Samsung Galaxy unpacked and I was not super impressed with the camera after using it more. It seemed like the video really struggled. And even when I went to get some of the footage off the phone to put in the video here, a lot of it corrupted, which means it was completely unusable. This is a pre-released phone so maybe some things will be smoothed out but it was really over sharpened. A lot of the video quality even on the main cameras was choppy and didn't really do well in bright or dark situations. And the portrait mode also struggled a lot and had a weird kind of cut issue around the phone. Not super impressed. One thing I found myself liking a lot more which was surprising was hassle blade's, XPA mode which gives you an extra long image and you can only adjust exposure before you shoot and there's no other extra filtering or changes that you can make. It's all just the camera itself and I enjoyed what I was able to get out of it anyways, like I said, not a full review. Just wanted to let you know though this is a bit of a miss. Back to me. I think you have a really solid package here and it might be something worth checking out for the first time in a long time when release the OnePlus 10 video. A lot of people were saying that the OnePlus 7 was the last good OnePlus phone and I might be being optimistic, but this seems like one of the first phones that is actually deserving of this flagship pricing. So if it ticks all those boxes it might be worth checking out. By the time you're watching this, have already opened and general sale goes up on February 16th so it might be something to keep your eye on. Thank you so much for watching.

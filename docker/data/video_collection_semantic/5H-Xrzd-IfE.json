Is there a way to get better FPS on your MacBook in Fortnite, Overwatch, PUBG, and other Battle Royale games? Apple just added support for eGPU over Thunderbolt 3! Now you can use NVIDIA or AMD graphics cards in both macOS and Windows through Boot Camp!  Follow Snazzy Labs on Twitter -  Follow me on Instagram -",

    "transcript": "Gaming on a Mac hasnt really been practical for well nearly 20 years; however, that may no longer be true in 2018. Apple recently released iMac Pro which is the first Mac in a long time with a legitimately good GPU. My base-model iMac Pro rocks an AMD Vega 56 and can run GTA V at 4K Ultra over 60FPS. Now, thats awesome, but its a $5,000 computer. It should be able to do that. Hope is not lost for the rest of Mac users, however, because two weeks ago, Apple officially brought support for Thunderbolt 3 eGPU enclosures to macOS. So you probably know where this is going on the left, Ive got the $5,000 iMac Pro. On the right, Ive got the cheapest MacBook Pro Apple sells at $1,300, a $230 Akitio Node eGPU enclosure, and inside of that, Ive got an NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti which I purchased last year before the crypto apocalypse for MSRP: $699. Good luck finding one for that price now. lol. The question is, can you really game on a Mac in 2018? Lets find out. Now, because macOS doesnt have any recent AAA games, were going to be doing all of our gaming in Windows. Luckily, Boot Camp remains a super easy way to install Windows 10 on a Mac. Both systems, unfortunately, have some semi-janky hoops youll have to jump through to get everything running as it should. On iMac Pro, when I launched Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, I was getting an average of just 9FPS at 1440p. That obviously shouldnt be happening on a Vega 56. For some inexplicable reason, Apples Boot Camp graphics drivers are outdated and horribly optimized for Windows. Furthermore, you cant just install the Vega 56 drivers that AMD provides either because Windows doesnt recognize the GPU by default. Luckily, BootcampDrivers.com is an incredible resource that provides modified versions of the latest official AMD drivers for Boot Camp-ed Macs and boy, do they work. After a quick and easy install, my iMac Pro was running Mankind Divided at an average of 57FPS at 1440p. Much better. I mentioned Apple added official eGPU support for macOS in 10.13.4, and thats true; however, only AMD Polaris and Vega cards are officially supported. NVIDIA thankfully provides macOS graphics drivers for most of their modern GPUs and they do work; however, its not native plug-and-play support. Sadly, neither AMD nor NVIDIA eGPUs are supported by Boot Camp. At least, not officially. My base-model 2017 MacBook Pro would boot into Windows with an eGPU just fine, but only the external monitor worked the MacBooks internal display wigged out. Luckily, the eGPU community is super active and I was able to get things working 100% in a matter of minutes. Basically, during a Windows boot, the MacBook deactivates the Intel integrated GPU if it notices another GPU present. This isnt a problem for the 15 MacBook Pro because it has a second dedicated GPU inside the laptop, but on my 13 MacBook Pro which only has Intel graphics, boot up stalls if an eGPU is connected. So, I had to create a USB drive that tricks the Macs EFI firmware into thinking its booting into macOS even though its actually booting into Windows. I may have just confused and terrified a fair number of you, but the whole process takes just 5 minutes to set up and the documentation is excellent. Its super easy to get eGPUs working in Windows through Boot Camp. And compatibility varies slightly by model, but basically every MacBook and iMac since 2011 are supported; however, it should be obvious that new Thunderbolt 3 Macs will far outperform older Thunderbolt 2 Macs. *phew* Okay, so now that both Macs are successfully booted into Windows and running at maximum performance, how do they perform? Honestly, in most games, they stack up pretty close. In Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, the iMac Pro slightly outperforms MacBook Pro with a 4FPS average difference at 1440p. In the new Far Cry 5, the two machines are neck-and-neck at a very playable 64FPS average at 1440p Ultra. Of course, less intensive games like Fortnite, PUBG, and Rocket League all run remarkably well. Even at 4K. The iMac Pro did have some slightly weird compatibility issues in certain games like Far Cry 5 because the monitor basically pretends to be two side-by-side displays running at 2560x2880 because the iMac Pros screen annoyingly still uses a custom timing controller from the original 2014 5K iMac instead of an updated embedded DisplayPort 1.3 connection for full 5K bandwidth; however, this issue was really only a problem in menus and not during actual gameplay. I didnt notice any screen tearing either, so thats good. Now are either of these systems going to outperform a comparably priced gaming PC? No, but for the first time in a very long time, gaming on a Mac actually works well and is a great option for Mac users wanting to play the latest PC titles without building a dedicated gaming machine. Unfortunately, we still need to boot into Windows for the latest games, but Vulkan has recently made its way to the Mac, and thats an exciting prospect for the future of gaming in macOS. If you enjoyed this video, please give it a thumbs up, if you didnt, that other button works okay too.

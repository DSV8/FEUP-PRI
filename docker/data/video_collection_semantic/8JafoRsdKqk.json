    "transcript": "what's up guys Eber here with Hardware Canucks and we're all familiar with Nvidia's RTX launched it's certainly an interesting topic to discuss especially given its current state in terms of pricing and if you recall we did mention that we're actually working on a comparison between the RTX 2080 and an affordable aftermarket custom gtx 1080 ti just so you know we paint the whole picture in terms of giving users another perspective so definitely stay tuned for that video but in the meantime I decided to put RTX to its paces when it comes to video editing because you know for content creators like myself a lot of people who are looking towards building a new workstation PC especially if it's someone who's working with Adobe Premiere Pro or even DaVinci Resolve might be looking to build you know an optimal workstation PC and they might be considering RTX so I decided to put RTX in compared to in videos 10 series of flagship which is the 1080 ti to see you're actually getting or if you're actually benefitting out of the new GPUs so let's check that out right after message from our sponsor evolve with the times consider nvme storage today the new RC 100 brings affordable nvme storage into your hands with various capacities in this super compact form factor that points directly into your motherboard it's extremely powerful and utilizes the Sheba's advance through the flash memory for awesome speeds so you can be a happy user the RC 100 by Toshiba the nvme Drive to consider check it out below okay so for this test I'll be using Nvidia's RTX 2080 ti founders edition hmm the most expensive consumer GPU to date next up we have Zotac gaming RTX 2080 amp Edition and finally Nvidia's flagship ten series GPU the most beloved 1080 TI in this case I'm using EVGA SC or superclocked black edition now I'm here to test out two main factors and the first one is playback performance because it is an important element for content creators because you know when they're working with Suites like Adobe Premiere Pro and of course eventually resolved you want to be able to get the best experience scrubbing through the timeline not experience any choppiness or lag when it comes to playing back the footage in real time so that's definitely something that we're going to be testing out on all three GPUs and of course the second is being rendering performance because as much as playback performance is important in fact a lot better than rendering it's again another factor for a lot of these content creators who are looking to build the workstation or an optimal workstation DC now mic test system consists of an Intel Core i7 8700k 6 core 12 third processor running at stock settings 32 gigabytes of Corsair Vengeance RGB memory set to 3,200 meters which is XMP rated speed I also have all of this setting on an ASUS Maximus 10 hero motherboard and for storage I have Samsung's 970 Evo one terabyte nvme SSD do note that I have enabled the integrated UHD graphics on the 8700K through the BIOS remember premier now takes advantage of Hardware encoding with Intel CPUs that have quicksand support to accelerate rendering times let's kick things off with Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2018 version twelve point one point one I loaded up a 12 minute 37 second 4k project primarily shot on the gh 5 you guys might recall this video it's the Lian Li PC 11 dynamic case review and starting with the EVGA gtx 1080 ti playback seems to be just fine with the full resolution I'll be it I did notice maybe a few frames dropped here and there especially with nested sequences for example if you have a particular you have to reverse that and if you want to add stabilization on top of that you have to nest that particular shot and that's obviously CPU intensive so the six core 12 thread CPU might become a little bit for bottleneck because it's got a lot of things to process so that's why you're kind of experiencing or that's why I ended up experiencing a few rain struck framedrops within those particular segments within this project interestingly enough when I looked at the resource monitor I noticed that the 1080 TI was being less utilized when compared to intel's new HD graphics sure CUDA acceleration plays an important role of playback but there is more room on the hardware side for these applications to chew through I did notice the same trend after switching to the Zotac RTX 2080 playback performance was pretty much identical when compared to the 1080 ti switching to the RTX 2080 TI and what can i say the GPU utilization especially with dedicated graphics didn't go over 35% it really looks like adobe has optimized playback performance to run as smoothly as possible by harnessing the integrated uHD graphics along with a little bit of cool acceleration with geforce cards provided that you're on an Intel mainstream platform like you know C370 or Z270 or if you're running an Intel CPU with quick sync support I also managed to put together a 12-minute project in DaVinci Resolve 15 remember this was the free version and I made sure to enable CUDA within the Preferences and to be honest play my performance on all three GPUs were identical I didn't experience any lag or choppiness in fact it was a little bit better than Premiere scrolling through the timeline was super smooth didn't really experience any artifacts or glitches whatsoever and it actually got me thinking if I should switch completely from premiere to resolve because the experience just after spending a day with resolve was a lot smoother than Premiere and yeah I just feel like I should have learned resolved a lot earlier than Premiere but I'm just too lazy to learn a new NLE that's Eber in a nutshell I should also mention that there was zero percent utilization on the UHD graphics during both playback and rendering I'm not sure if this is a limitation with the free version versus a studio version but it is something to keep in mind anyways let's switch gears and talk about rendering performance so starting with Adobe Media encoder I took that 12 minute 37 second project exported to the YouTube 4k preset make sure you have hardware encoding enabled within the encoder settings if you're using an Intel CPU with QuickSync support and as you can see the difference is actually not that significant especially if you take the RTX 2080 and the GTX 1080 ti and put them head-to-head we're talking a few seconds of difference here which is not a big deal even the RTX 2080 Ti doesn't yield that much of an improvement I did monitor system resources to see how the workload was being shared across the hardware and just as expected the CPU was hovering around 50 percent the Intel uHD graphics was well over 70 percent and he discrete Nvidia cards I tested here where you'd lost between 25 to 50 percent so that means you still have some resources left in the tank if you want to work on other tasks while your video is being rendered so your system doesn't you know crash while basically maxing on every system resources you possibly have our last test here is with DaVinci Resolve 15 I took the 12 minute clip that I quickly stitched together apply to LUT on top of that and exported it to the YouTube 4k h.264 precent and the results were pretty much neck to neck with the RTX 2080 TI RTX 2080 and the gtx 1080 ti again it's all about hardware and software optimizations and for fun sakes I decided to throw a GTX 1060 to the mix to see what the results were and to my surprise it took the exact same amount of time to render that 12-minute clip with DaVinci Resolve 15 and it really proves that you don't have to spend $1000 on a graphics card to get the best editing experience you actually better off with the 1060 or 1070 to get a better experience because you know you're not really going to be taking advantage of 100% of the GPU when you're editing with programs like resolve now switching to the Adobe Media encoder test I think that's where things start to become a little bit different because with a 1060 it took six minutes longer to render when compared to the 1080 ti and the RTX 2080 TI so again that's something that Adobe still has to work with in terms of figuring out how well can it optimize the discrete graphics card the integrated uHD graphics and of course the CPU so it's there it's certainly getting there to a point where you can rely on some of the hardware within your system but again resolve is definitely tempting me to switch over I also ended up testing the render times in Premiere with the integrated uHD graphics disabled through the BIOS and just as expected they were again neck to neck but all three configurations took more than nine minutes to complete the render so at the end of the day if you're looking for a discreet graphics card to accelerate video editing performance completely skip the RTX cards at least for now and Adobe decides to take advantage of the tensor course in the RT cores and I would actually put that money towards high-capacity memory or extra storage because those factors are very crucial for content creators the gtx 1070 1080 and 1080 TI are still great options for Adobe Premiere the be quiet dark based pro 900 revision 2 is here with the modern IO for your type C accessories and Qi charging gadgets the new hub is good for 8 fans and RGB strips plus steam terior is incredibly modular for airflow water cooling invert systems and now with a power supply shroud check out the v2 down below and that about wraps up this test I still have one more thing that I want to work on which is just basically comparing different file formats because premiere actually it kind of behaves differently with different file formats particularly with jh5 footage sony a7r footage as well you've also got red files and Canon raw light files as well so again the software behaves differently with different file formats I want to make sure that I test those formats on both intel's cpus with quicksand support and of course the x299 workstation skylake x pcs so yeah it's definitely gonna be quite time intensive as well so certainly have to spend some time testing those let me know if you guys are interested in that video in the comments down below I mean we're with hybrid connects thank you so much for watching make sure to check out some relevant content over here subscribe to a new boot sequence channel for the latest tech news and rumors I'm signing off and I'll see you guys in the next one RTX RTX RTX I'm just kidding I'm just kidding I don't want to I don't want to promote our RTX anymore I mean it's a good card I mean it's fast it's the fastest GPU that's right available right now the 2080 ti that is yeah but it's expensive so it's certainly an interesting topic to discuss especially given its current state in terms of pricing stop I order you to stop",

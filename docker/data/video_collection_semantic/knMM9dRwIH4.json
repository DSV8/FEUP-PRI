(discount code is case sensitive)  Parts I used: Intel i7-7700K CPU -  Crucial MX300 2TB SSD -  PC4-19200 260-pin RAM -  OWC Thermal Sensor for SSD -  iMac Display Adhesive Kit -  SSD Bracket -  iMac Opening Tool -   Footnote #1: I actually bought the mid-grade model. At the time, I wasnt sure the CPU coolers were the same across all 27 models. I have since learned that they are; so if you buy the cheapest 5K iMac, you can do all the upgrades I mention in this video without issue.  Footnote #2: This is not an instructional disassembly video. I recommend checking the guides on iFixit. They are well illustratedprovide adequate caution and warning for tricky areasand have a community section where people provide advice. At the time of this video, there is no updated guide for the 2017 iMac; however, it's very similar to the 2014-2015 A1419 model. The only big difference is the screw placement on the motherboard. Just take your time finding all of the screws (one is hidden through the gold hole in the middle of the board) and you'll be fine.  Footnote #3: A little drama that wasn't included in the video is that the first time around, the CPU got bumped out of the socket when I screwed in the cooler, so the CPU wasn't seated correctly and the computer didn't boot. Upon disassembling the machine again, I saw the CPU was out of the socket and partially bent. I bent the CPU back (silicon bends easily without damaging, luckily), reinserted it into the socket, and was more careful when I tightened the CPU cooler the second time. It's easy to wiggle the CPU out of place when installing the cooler, so be carefuland if it feels too hard to tighten the CPU socket, stopsomething is wrong.  Footnote #4 - My machine's GeekBench results:   The 27\" 5K iMac is a good computer for many; however, to users that want high-end specs, Apple charges way too much money. Snazzy Labs pulls apart a base model iMac, upgrades the CPU, SSD, and RAM; showing the world the best iMac that Apple doesn't sell! Get the world's best iMac configuration for $2,000 less than what Apple charges.  This video is sponsored by Dashlane; a service that Snazzy Labs loves and uses.

    "transcript": "Apple said, Hey, do you wanna spend over $5grand on an iMac. Um. no? So I build my own insteadand I saved... nearly $2,000. [intro animation] This video is sponsored by Dashlane: The Simple, Secure way to Manage Your Passwords - learn more through the link below The idea for this video was pretty simple. Buy a base-model iMac and gut the insides to put in a better CPU, more solid-state storage, and an obscenely unnecessary amount of RAM. Why? Well, my souped up Mac Pro I upgraded a few months back was doing great, but I was still using a cheap 1440p monitorwhich is obviously not ideal for editing 4K video. And trying to find a 5K display is basically impossible. Theyre either discontinued, obscenely expensive, or incompatible with Mac Pro. Thats right, the UltraFine 5K display that Apple co-developed with LG and sells in Apple Stores runs on a Mac Pro at 1440pnot 5K. Not even 4K. So I bought a base-model iMac I could upgrade myself. I also decided to pay an extra $300 to upgrade to from the stock fusion drive to Apples annoyingly proprietary, but in my opinion, necessary NVMe SSD for a hyper-fast boot drive. And then, I bought the rest of my upgrades separately. I bought an Intel i7-7700K CPU to replace the i5-7600 that came with the iMac, I bought a 2TB Crucial MX300 SSD that I could use as a secondary very-fast internal storage drive (which, by the way, brings total internal SSD storage in the iMac to 2.5TB), and I bought 64GB of G.SKILL DDR4 memory. 64GB of RAM is excessive, but I wanted to match Apples most expensive offering as best as I could. Oh, and I bought a few extra, but necessary tools. My total price came just shy of $3,500. Its certainly not a drop in the bucket, but compared to the $5,300 Apple charges for the near-same configuration, I feel like I did pretty good. Especially since I have an extra CPU and RAM I could sell on Craigslist if I want. Installing everything was actually easier than I expected. The 5K display is glued to the aluminum chassis with very strong tape, but ifixit makes this cute little cutting wheel that loosens the adhesive without damaging any of the sensitive ribbon cables that near the edge of the display. This is the best $8 youll ever spend. Dont risk breaking the screen with guitar picks, heat guns, or any other crappy tools that some sites recommend. Just get the wheel. With some patience, the display will come loose from the chassis. There are two ribbon connectors to undo, and voila! The Mac is ready for surgery. I start off by removing the left speaker which is pretty simple and then I find my way to removing the power supply. This is a completely exposed PSU which can cause serious injury or death if handled improperly, but as long as you hold the board by the edges and dont touch any of the solder joints, youll be fine. Then I turn my attention to the right speaker which is slightly trickier to remove than the left, but still quite easy. Its pretty amazing how much room inside the iMac is taken up by the speaker assemblies, isnt it? Next I address the fan. This single, small fan cools the CPU, GPU and its VRMS. Next I remove the bluetooth and wifi antennae. Once we remove the motherboard, its finally time to take off the cooler thats shared by both the GPU and CPU. Ill clean up the old thermal paste with rubbing alcohol and a microfiber cloth, and now I can install our sexy new i7-7700K and put the cooler right back on. But wait! Before I screw the motherboard back in, I need to plug in Apples proprietary data/power cable combo for our SSD. Luckily, Apple hasnt changed the design of these since 2012, so you can get them on eBay for cheap. Once I get most of the components installed back in the case, I can turn our attention to that 2TB SSD. Since the mounting bracket in the Mac is for a 3.5 drive, I needed a cheap adapter from Amazon. I also needed an OWC Thermal Sensor cable. The hard drives Apple uses from the factory have proprietary controllers for reporting drive temperatures to the motherboard. If you dont have this cable, the iMac doesnt know what temperature your SSD is and runs the fan at 100% speed all the time. Unbearable. This cable fixes that. And thats about it. I used a custom-cut adhesive kit I found on Amazon to seal the Mac back up and once we pop the RAM in through the RAM door (thanks for at least giving us that, Apple), were done! But how does the machine actually perform? Really well. In GeekBench, my scores were about 30% higher than with the i5 I swapped with, and surprisingly, about 8% better than Apples fully-loaded iMac with the exact same CPU model. This trend continued through my Cinebench results as well. The scores shouldnt be that different between my 7700K iMac and Apples 7700K iMac; 8% is outside of the margin of error. Either I got really lucky with the silicon lottery, or maybe, just maybe, Apple could be buying the runts, the lower performing 7700K from Intel on discount. My 5K iMac out-benchmarks every single computer in Apples lineup. There are two downsides to this build: 1) you void your warranty the minute you start prying the screen offto some, thats a big dealto me, no warranty is worth the $1,800 I saved; 2) my GPU is worse than the fully loaded Apple model. At the same time, they all suck for gaming, and in an application like Final Cut Pro X, where I expected Apples fully-loaded iMac with the Radeon Pro 580 to outperform mine, it doesnt. In both the BruceX benchmark and my own video export test, my iMac was about 5% faster. By doing the upgrades myself, I got a faster machine with more storage for $1,800 less and only an hour of work. To make that hour back and a whole lot more, you should checkout Dashlane, our sponsor for this video. Using the same password for everything is really bad idea.

    "transcript": "So I've been making videos for a long time. Sometimes I forget, and I'm sure you do too. It's been many years. Many products. Over a 1,000 in fact! I have never looked at a product like this before! That's the truth! Jack can attest to it. This my friends, Is some tech where you least expect it. That's like a flashy... It's like a tag. \"Tech where you least expect it!\" There's a lot of products in our life that haven't been - \"Teched up\" yet! Here's the thing. You guys know I wear a hoodie, alright? I got a hoodie in almost every video. Did I think there would come a day where I would be looking at a hoodie that did so much more? It wasn't on the horizon as far as I was concerned. Then, these guys, G-Tech, reached out to me. They said, \"We got this new product. We want you to you to be the one to show it to the world.\" And help us launch it on Kickstarter, 'cause that's how fresh it is! That's how new it is, it's like a hot, it's like a fresh pizza right now, out of the oven. First, I gotta give you a little bit of the background origin story, the reason why there's two boxes, so look at this, okay? This is the company's background. It's a hand warmer. You stick your hands inside, it's got this thing in the center. Patent pending 'therma-grip'. You're a golfer, you play football, you're a hunter, you're outside working on a regular basis. That's the intent. You're construction, medical, fishing, photographers. These puppies. You need to use them, you need the dexterity. You get it steamed up, you get back to work. That's the origin story behind this product. Your boy Cam Newton, yes world famous quarterback actually was using this in his last game, you can look it up yourself. Keepin' these paws heated up for that precision. A lot of people can benefit from this. Here's what it looks like. So the hands go in like this. There's a little strap on the inside which you put them on top of. You got a little bit of storage in there, as well. Maybe you like to go watch football games, hockey games... Alright? You just keep the hands in there, you're all set! You got a little LED on there to let you know if you're powered up. And then this thing starts to steam. So this little guy here, this is your battery. Boom. Charge it up, you're ready to go. You're ready to get out and about out in the wilderness. You plug that in. There is a little pocket for it. That is what's going to supply all of your juice. Jack, pick up the red LED. Now you're heating up! It's already getting warm. No word of a lie. This thing is already out there. Now, this is not gonna be for everyone, right? What the world really needs is some tech right in the hoodie. I'm like the Hoodie Master. I'm like Yoda of the hoodie game. Oh my goodness, it's an Unbox Therapy Version! I did not even know that. This one also has what looks like a car charger. Here is what the hoodie looks like. And here is the heated portion. You can see the same G logo here. That's gonna act as your power button. This is almost like a coat replacement on its own. Now I got a lot of friends. Ya know, buddies that work outdoors. I could see them getting very motivated by something like this. Seriously. Oh... It's got like a certain type of Velcro there. It's a very subtle Velcro, it's not as intense as some of the other stuff. On the inside here, once again I'm just gonna show Jack, this rail that you grip onto. So, water-resistant looking stuff. So if you get a little bit of rain on you or something like that, you should be well protected. Once again, when it comes to the battery, there's a little pocket for it. Let's go ahead, let's try this baby on. Jack, you're always cold. You would love of these, eh? You're always freezing. So, look at that! Look at that baby right there! 1 of 1000 Unbox Therapy Limited Edition of a prototype. It's not even out yet! Look at that. Light goes red. Jack, pick that up for them. It looks like a normal hoodie, nobody needs to know what's going on. You just sneak in there and your hands are getting warm. What I like about this it, starts heating right away. Now let's see. I switch it off, press and hold, and I'm back. Nobody even knows what's going on. I just look like a dude in a hoodie, aint no big deal, I'm just gonna... What you're talking about? *walks towards Jack threateningly* You lookin' at my hoodie? Maybe you gotta walk to school. Maybe you gotta be outdoors for work. Maybe you like to be outdoors. Maybe you like to have binoculars and look at birds or... or play a sport that's outdoors. Survival people! Maybe you like to go to outdoor music festivals and it gets a little bit chilly. I gotta be honest with you guys. I got a problem with jackets. I can never get into jacket weather. And this is from a guy who lives in Canada, alright? I live in Toronto. And I can't get used to pulling the jacket out of the closet. You think you got it all together? Well, you don't! Because this temperature's dipping and you're unprepared. This is the best of both worlds. It doesn't feel like a coat, but when you add in that heating potential down there, you're gonna make a lot of dudes jealous. With the beer in one hand, warming up the other, and then you do the switch-a-roo. The link down in the description. I'm helping these guys launch on Kickstarter. Tom! Tom: Yeah? Come here for a sec. Tom, I want you to put your hand inside my hoodie. Say Hi. Tom: Hey! Lewis: Please put your hand inside my hoodie. Lewis: Easy man! Tom: Hahahaha Lewis: [Screams] Lewis: Grab that thing. Lewis: Grab that thing! Lewis: Grab it. Lewis: What you got? Tom: It's pretty *inaudible/laugh* Lewis: What, TOM! Lewis: Did you feel it? Tom: Yeah Tom: My hands are sweaty. Lewis: *Laughs* It's been said many times Many wayyyyyys! Merry Christmas to you",

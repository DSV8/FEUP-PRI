    "transcript": "- So iPad, you think you're a computer huh? (scoff) (soft music) Big talk, I guess we'll find out whether you are or you aren't. (laughs) - [Andy] (laughs) - Apple's been trying to make the iPad into a computer for a long time now. And that's not, you know. (clunk) This is how I started the actual iPad short circuit as well. It is a computer! We all know it's a computer, guys. But now Apple has you know, released the magic keyboard attachment. With not only the magic keyboard with the scissor based switches that they had. Which was good, and then switched out with the worst one, the butterfly keyboard. It also has a track pad, on an iPad? How many pads can we handle? The answer is two. (laugh) And that's why we're here today. We got the iPad magic keyboard and we're gonna see if once you put it on the (clunk sound) 12.9 inch iPad or you put the 12.9 inch iPad Pro onto this one, does that a computer make? Off it comes (clunk). That's pretty heavy that that feels like half a half of a laptop, sure enough. Let's unwrap this sucker, (clunk). Okay, I'm excited. Cause I've seen a lot about this in the past few weeks. (clunk) We got the you know, the iPad Pro 2020 Edition. And I've already done a whole review on that on LTT and we also did a short circuit on it, and now we have the thing that could make it a laptop. Is it, oh, oh! That's some resistance! Like I expected this to be a folio case like on the old folio cases. They're very loose, you know. When you open it up, it's kind of floppy. This like, immediately I'm getting some resistance. Oh, and then it stops. Boom. And then it keeps going. This is really weird. Design by Apple in California. Tell me about yourself iPad. Open magic keyboard and fold back to attach iPad. Adjust viewing angle as needed. Okay, I'll, we'll see how good that is. Charge iPad using the USBC port. So that's one of the interesting things about this, it adds an extra USBC port. Not on that side, but on that side! Right there! Also apologize to anyone seeing the top down camera today. My hands look groody. From over washing but we're all on the same boat with that, hopefully. That one didn't that wasn't wasn't a success (agh). Should I try this out without the iPad on it? No. On the iPad goes. Boom! That is magical. Okay, we got bit of like. Oh, that actually goes farther back than I thought it would. Pretty impressive, it looks like it's floating. It's like, levitation. Wingardium Leviosa, you know what I'm talking about? Can you use it on your lap? That's a great question Andy. Yes you can! - [Andy] So it's a laptop? - I guess so. If you can use it on you lap it's a laptop. But look at this. I'm using it on my lap. - [Andy] (laugh) - Ha Ha! You know what? Right off the bat I want to see how easy it is. If I was like, Oh I'm using my tablet do be do do do do, and then oh gotta go, gotta bring my keyboard. (clunk) Failed the first test. Oh gotta go! Boom! (slams laptop) Okay, that was a lot better. Maybe it's just lack of practice. Okay, so that's an issue right away. How do I, it's not. Usually with you know, with these modern laptops, there's kind of an easier way to open it up. You put it down and you want to lift up the screen. (scoffs) You gotta squeeze your fingers in there. So when you put it down, open it up! (noise) (scoffs) It's pretty impressive how, like you know. When you do open it up, it kind of just like flips into place. You'd think that it, it looks fragile. When I first saw the launch video for these, and the those kind of sizzle reels. It looks like, it looked kind of fragile. But it does feel very sturdy. Let's find out how much it weighs. After this word from our sponsor! Oh, what? That's right, your short circuit is brought to you by PIA. They're a VPN that keeps you safe and secure, with a protected IP. You can connect up to five devices on Windows, Linux, IOS, Android, MAC OS, all those good guys. And it comes with an Internet kill switch so you can stay in control with your connection. Check them out, and their thirty day money back guarantee at the link below. So how much do they weigh? That's what I was saying. Let's find out. (clunk) Oh geez! Okay, in kilograms okay, .608. And, this thing, .656! This is actually heavier than the iPad. So you you get yourself a computer, and you get yourself a keyboard that weighs more. (laugh) Now I understand why they did that though. It's because when you sit the iPad on it, it has to stay upright. If the iPad weighed more than the keyboard, it would just kind of tip over. Which you know would make things more interesting. But no one wants that. Okay, so before I, you know what? Enough of that, let me talk about the keyboard. Let's find out. I'll log in, let's bring up a note, Oh wait I have a, oh I have a mouse now! I completely forgot I was gonna start using the iPad (laughs) with my finger. Now, I already kind of talked about this when I did the full iPad review. But I think using it with a track pad is a whole different experience. You move the mouse around and then there's like noticeable drift. Maybe they there's a bit more of that using the iPad. Ooo, that feels kind of nice! I'm not gonna lie, that's a keyboard. Crazy how like we're using this iPad as if it's a computer and not an iPad. Oh! I fel like the travel is even less than I remember on similar magic keyboards. But maybe that's just my you know, rose colored glasses. I'm writing a, I'm writing a little soliloquy here. Okay, so to compare that, I'm gonna bring up the other regular. (clunk) Geez that (laughs) (clunk) iPad Folio. So this is kind of what Apple was going with last generation. Was this kind of like flippy, flobby, wibbily, keyboard (clunking noise) that's nothing special. You know? It was cool, it protected your iPad, it gave you a keyboard, and you know, in case you were like on the go and you know, and you needed to like answer some emails or something and needed to type out something. There's two positions, to put the screen in and even when they're in there, it's like pretty wobbly. But this is what we were dealing with before and this is obviously a huge upgrade. We've gone from a tablet with a dinky little keyboard attachment to something that looks a lot like an actual laptop. Do we have to call it a laptop now? - [Andy] Taptop. - Taptop to padtop. Okay. So, over here, Hello friend. This is an iPad and, See how okay, Maybe I'm crazy, but I almost like this keyboard more (laughs). Am I crazy? Why do I like that better? I just attached and iPad, and it's awesome! I might I might have just been crazy for a second, You know, you that happens sometimes. You know, you can just like go insane or like ten seconds. Okay, no. Never mind, never mind. All right. But, but I think that all that says is that the keyboard that they initially put in this thing, and I think I said when I reviewed it is that this was a very impressive keyboard. But, this is a real keyboard. This is like really good for a tiny keyboard and this is like a magic keyboard. The track pad is very small, as you can see. It's almost like, the Surface Pro track pads. It looks just like that, but it feels like an Apple track pad. Like this is smooth and I know I complained about the the drifting but it almost like works well with this. Am I just being swayed by the Apple you know, polish? I need to compare it to a like a real laptop in order to kind of take it down a notch. In a LG Gram 217, or as I like to call it the Gam. Because the R fell off. (laugh) The 17 inch, obviously it looks huge compared to the 12.9 inch, but like you know, the 12.9 inch iPad is the same size as like a 13 inch you know laptop. So it's maybe not a super fair comparison. But what I really wanted to compare was its' versatility. One of the great things about light laptops is they're like a full computer. You can set them down. You can lift the lid with one hand, and you got you know, something going on there. And that's what you expect big nice, big track pad, over here. Now, (slams lid) I put it down, as if I'm gonna work somewhere (clunk). I have to, you have to get your fingernails in there. It's just a little annoying, and I'm not seeing the same kind of like versatility. I mean it's nice, it it it goes back to enough of an angle. Yeah, this isn't bad. All right. (clunk) You know what would really seal the deal for the iPad Pro as a laptop is if they. Because it has keyboard and like full mouse support now, if they if they put some games on here that you could play with mouse and keyboard. That would be something. You know what I just noticed, this keyboard is missing a row of stuff. So like we got, we got the arrow keys, we got all this normal stuff. We get up to the number row, and then there's no function row and there's no escape button. How am I going to escape from things? Now I know there's probably, there's probably a ton of shortcuts. That's what I heard, that there were shortcuts somewhere. If I, there must be something that works. Um, uh hello? Hello? Um, screw it! I hate iPads! (laughs) Command Oh, oh, thank you. Oh, you're you're a Mac user aren't you Andy? Yeah. What do you, what do you want to see? I'm in W, oh, closed the tab, it did. What are regular Mac things? Command Shift 4, what does that do? Oh! There's no escape key. I would, that is a situation where I would like to have an escape key. Just to be like get me, get me out of here. It's a bit frustrating that Apple kind of went this direction again. Because it looked like they were using the iPad to kind of go in this bold new direction, of like hey. You know, you got desktop computers, you got laptops, and now, we want to to to to be able to have this new category tablets, that are actual computers that you can use for work, not just entertainment machines. Why would I get this over a Mackbook Pro? Who is buying this and why? Because this is, the 12.9 inch compatible version of the magic keyboard case is 350 bucks, U.S. and [Andy] - Ooh. - And the 11 inch one is 300 dollars. So you're adding that on to the iPad Pro, which is all ready. You know. If you're getting one that you can use as your main computer. It's around a thousand dollars for a good configuration on that iPad Pro. Plus a three-hundred and fifty dollar keyboard. Why would you buy this instead of a macbook? Or a capable windows laptop? I don't know! It's an you know, it's an you know like one of Apple's flagship things. So I can understand it being that expensive. I don't think it's justified to make it that expensive. But it makes sense for Apple to do that. Anyways, I'm excited to do the full review for this. And pretty impressed with the overall design and manufacture of it. I didn't really I didn't really pay around with the extra USBC port but we'll get more into that in the full review. For now, thanks for watching. And don't forget to subscribe to short circuit for more of these types of videos. And don't forget that I love you very much.",

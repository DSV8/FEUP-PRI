    "transcript": "- Ah, summer, the season to enjoy the great outdoors. - And spend time with your friends, sharing drinks. - And roasting the hell outta your setups. - That's right. It's barbecue time. - You're the meat. - And we're the heat. - So buckle up chuckle nuts! (Alex roaring) - 'Cause your filthy, outdated rigs are about to get so roasted that you are gonna run upstairs and cry to your momma. - What? - No, no, no. Wow! And we'll be doing our roasting from the comfort of our gorgeous Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Pro X laptop configurable with up to 32GB LPDDR5 memory in an RTX 3050, the Slim 7i Pro X can accelerate your creativity with Lenovo's new X power performance tuning and beautiful 3K 120 Hertz PureSight display. It's hardware calibrated for true to life color and looks absolutely awesome. It comes packaged in a unibody aluminum chassis with Lenovo's comfort edge design that feels great to use even during those long creative roasting sessions. Without further ado, let's hop right into it. First up is Vr Vrencik. This is disgusting - As someone that has a lot of mess on their desk, most of the time, I find this disturbing. - Then we've got the cable management on the floor. - Oh, why is there so many phones? - Yeah, why are there so many phones? What are you? A drug dealer? - No, there's so many. Okay., how many phones are there in there? - There's at least four phones. - Okay, hold on, - One, two - hold on a second. - three, four - Hold on, hold on. I'm working on it. I'm working on it. And hence, this looks like an old Note or do you remember that old people spec Samsung that was even bigger than the Note. - [Alex] So, that's an impressive power bar. Does it have individual like plug? - That is way more common in Europe? - Oh! No, there's so many phones. - Why are there so many phone? Why are there, there's even more phones? Ah, I think this may be a phone repair side hustle setup. See there's some half assembled, half disassembled phones and what looks like a work light. - The thing I never understand about these is like, whenever, if my system's a mess, like my table is disgusting. If I'm going to take a picture of it I'm gonna take five seconds to remove the dirty Kleenexes that are behind as monitored. - Not to mention the clean wipes which are definitely for repairing devices. I honestly don't see what's wrong with this one. Wait, do you sit on the floor? - Oh, that can't become comfortable. - Is that what I'm looking at here? Floor actual gang. This is a coffee table Alex. - Oh, that would hurt. I was going to say that I kind of like this one especially the fact that they have what looks like pretty good audio gear on the right there. - Got the RGB speakers. You got whatever this '70s, '80s amplification gear is over here, that's all pretty cool. - Do we have specs? It said it was only 300 CAD. - You know what? It's not about the car you drive, it's about how you drive it, okay. I don't know if I'd go with a Vaseky SSD. That's the one thing you don't F around with cheap storage but other than that, Hey, I like it. We're moving to summer house, IDK what you are saying in Canada. What am I looking at? This is a cupboard. This is not one but two stacked lawn chairs. You needed your chair a half inch higher but you didn't have a small piece of two by four to put under the, like I don't even know what the better solution to this would be. I like it, two chairs. Your keyboard is hanging off the side of your cupboard and your mouse is literally operating on, not one, not two but three fabric surfaces here. Every time I open one of these, I'm afraid of what I'm gonna see. Deusmortuorum, oh, rocking the fake plant wall. Got the custom, faux neon sign with your name. - I don't know how to feel about the having your name on your setup. - As someone who has my name all over, basically, everything that I own, I feel like I can't judge too hard. I do avoid it at home though. (Alex laughing) - I guess the question is, are they like a Twitch streamer where it would be good to have, but then that's not even in the thing. - Yeah, it's not. You're literally just like, \"Yeah, I'm at my setup and I got my gamer name here, shining down on me. I am basking in its glow.\" It's cringe. That is a king-tier footrest. Wow! Can I please have a footrest? And while we're at it, cable management like this. I'll forgive you for your stupid gamer tag that is on a weird plant wall, if you send me one of these footrests. Mac Mini M1 as daily, Oh, PC for streaming and gaming, got it. What the hell is this? This has never been cleaned. - It's not even difficult either like that's within arm's reach. - And clean your mouse pad. Ew, - [Adam] And the robot vacuum. - Yeah! God, what a lazy setup. - You could literally just take your mouse pad, put it on the floor. On the next day, it will be fine. - You don't even have to do that. Go get a microfiber cloth or something, just get it wet and wipe it down with the grain and it'll be way cleaner than that. - Same with the Mac Mini. - Why is your computer like covered in fingerprints? What are you doing to it? Clean up, just do it. Celeron laptop type beat, also got a low spec core 2 duo machine at home but no pics of it. (Alex laughing) This is the entire set. I see you had your potato handy to take the picture. - Okay, this might be very trendy Linus. I went to a show last night and there were some like cool-looking kids and they had like old digital cameras that were taking pictures. - [David] That's super trendy now. - Is it really? - [David] Point-and-shoot's from like the 2000s. (Linus clapping) - I'm ahead of a trend for the first time. I gave my kids, my old Powershot like a couple years ago. I was like, \"Well, this has no use to me whatsoever. Realistically, I don't care if you beat the crap out of it.\" - [David] Your kids are so cool now, Linus. - Yes! Okay, WheelyNerman. Ew. - What? - How? - Ew, why would you show me this? Where there are spiders, there are other bugs. The fact that a spider made a web in here means that you're disgusting as computer had something for it to eat. - It also, it looks like it is probably a very nice case. It's a Kingpin. - Yeah! - GPU. - This is a high spec machine. This is an EK Water Blocks AIO in here. This is like a multi-thousand dollar computer with a disgusting spider web in it. CameIAndCheeta? Camel and Cheeta (laughing) Apple computer m1, plate is for pizza. Wow! This is like, you got the check, you got the bills. - Two hard drives? - It's like a flex picture but these are $1 bills. You need to spend less money on YouTuber figurines and more money on headphones that are not awful. Is this transparent like scotch tape holding it together? What are you taking a picture with here? Is this, what is this? Are you a pad hole? - [Adam] It's worse, they're holding a wallet case. - A wallet case. - Just making this a nice setup is not that much work. - Yeah, I mean, you've got a natural wood desk that sure, it's rustic, but it has potential. Look at all this raw potential, Alex and then you just like, basically, took your junk drawer, dumped it out on the desk, scattered it around a bit, cleared some space, put a MacBook in the middle of it, pulled out your awful wallet case for your phone and took this picture. - This seems like the kind of room where I walk into it and my sinuses start clogging out. - This seems like the kind of room where they should be too ashamed to let you walk into it if you visit, they should be like, \"Yeah, no, I don't have a room. Let's hang out in the living room.\" All right, Nathaniel Fife. - [Alex] Oh damn! - This is nice. Got the LED strips up in here, got the low resolution image uploaded, okay, use the microphone once in a while. Wow! Got the his and hers setup with the matching LTT desk pads. What am I supposed to roast here? I mean, you could organize your files a little bit better. I also can't say I'm a huge fan of the carpet protectors going over this rug hump here. It's probably not the best but are the computers inside these ventilated cabinets because that I like - Can you go back? I think that it's said that he custom made the whole thing. - No way! Custom computers are in the cabinets on the left and right complete with built in fan sucking air through the mesh on the cabinet doors. Wow! I like it. - Ah! - You know what they say about how the state of your room says a lot about your mind and on in person, your mind might be a little busy. Do you have a busy mind? Also, I don't know why you gotta get out and say the headset's not for porn, like A, what made you think we were gonna go there with it? And B, come on! - There's a lot going on. - I love this camera mount. What could that possibly be attached to? Such that it would sit at that angle. - Is that just a, like a monopod? - Yeah, but what is it anchored to? - [Adam] Can you address the first sentence of this tweet? - First sentence is I sleep on the bean. - What? - Wait, that's your bed? (Adam laughing) - That's not okay. - Are you a dog? No, no, no. Your back does not like this. You must be young and it might seem okay now but that is not okay. - Please don't do that, like just seriously don't - Oh my God. - Get a bed. - Specs 3600 1660 cable management is by no means great, but not at its worst. - Yeah, it's fine. - Either, you watch a lot of soap operas at your computer or. - In fairness, we see the bin right there and it's filled with other things, so. - So what does that mean? That they like to eat Oreos while they enjoy the thing? - I'm just saying there might be low utilization of the tissue box. - But they don't get any points for that. I gotta say I do like the around the desk LED lighting. I know it's kind of an older style now, but I'm into it. - What? - I am somewhat of a car enthusiast but that doesn't mean that your desk needs to be covered in car toys, that doesn't explain the other garbage. This is like a sticker bomb desk except these are not stickers. This is actually just piles of crap. - It's like, is there, I don't know what you'd call it. It's like triggering my trypophobia bit of cars. Is that a six pack on the side? - [Adam] Yeah. - That's also just, why is it not in a fridge? - I was gonna say, what are you gonna drink it warm? - Oh yes, you could take the duster. Flip her upside down. - Is this peanut satay sauce? (Alex laughing) Why is that here? Is this fork to do with the satay sauce? Do you just eat it out of the bottle? - In fairness, there could probably be a small animal on there for weeks and you wouldn't even know. - I hate this. - Yeah, this is my least favorite so far and that's really saying something. - This looks pretty nice. Love your wheel setup here, okay, justifiable VR headset. All right, yeah, there's a wheel here for sim racing, fair enough. - I don't appreciate the mic between the monitors again. - What is this mic between monitors trend? What is happening here? We spent years, the poor monitor manufacturers out there. Do you know how much engineering they've put into reducing the size of your bezels so your screens can be as close to each other as possible? Then you go, you put a (beep) microphone in between them. What is wrong with you? Wow! I haven't seen one of those actually deployed at a gamer setup. I think ever. - No, no. - When I was working at NCIX, we did sell some, but I'd never seen one out in the wild. Is this your-- - It's probably just their room. - They probably have a shared bathroom. - [Adam] They have a picture of the other side of the room. - Okay, let's see the other side of their-- - What? Damn it! This ruined it. People get beds. (all laughing) - Is this mousepad on a separate desk? - Wait, they also have a steam controller, speaking of things I've never seen in the wild. - I hate the ergonomics of this. (Alex laughing) Look how much lower this desk is, so you're gaming like this, Also, that's a tiny mousepad. What is up with these tiny mouse pads? - [David] I don't know. High sensitivity gaming is just incorrect, right? Like are we all on the same page about this? - Yeah. - [David] Oh yeah. - Why do people not sleep in beds, Alex? - I don't know. I really like beds. - Well, here's a bed. - Oh, good job. - College dorm room setup, this is looking kind of sick, actually. I love this, by the way. Actually printing out memes and posting them on your wall, (Linus clapping) I love it. That is some next level art. Also, rocking the LTT store water bottle, got the ramen bowl at the desk, triple monitor setup, dang! - Where's the PC under the bed? - Oh, I think you're right. That might not be the desk for cooling but shout out this amazing bedspread. Are those your dogs? (Alex laughing) That is so cool. - It's almost even more fun if they earned. - [Linus] This is looking - [Alex] What is this? - like a pretty cool setup. - Yeah - Okay, you're really embracing that '90s living room vibe. - I feel like we need to look for a bong. This has big bong energy. - Yeah, I think we can agree that the comfort of a couch is inversely proportional to the ugliness of a couch. - In many situations. - And if that's true, then we can assume that this is one of the world's most comfortable couches. - What? This is a beautiful couch. - It looks like (beep) (Alex laughing) It looks like it's designed to hide poo stains. I do not like the microwave. The fact that you cannot get off your ass and go to the kitchen to microwave hot pocket. - The 3090 in that? What? Okay, just back up for a second. - [Adam] Go back to the computer, you missed a big one. - What? - What is happening? Is this not a PCIE extension with a separate fan card propped up on what appeared to be prescription inhaler cartridges, (Alex laughing) with a back plate, heat sink, just like what, thermal taped onto it and a desk fan attached to that. - Oh my God! It's amazing. - Also there's a sloppy drive. Tell me racing is the only thing you use your computer for without telling me racing is the only thing you use your computer for. The thing that kills me most about this one is that there absolutely is room (Alex laughing) for these monitors to not be overlapping. You move this one to the left. Your keyboard is already aligned that way, just move it to the left a little. - Well, but it's pretty clear that they have it set up for the sim rig, so they just have the one, it is too high up, but like whatever. - It's a little too high. This is easily removable. This is like eight screws to pull this thing off the top. It's not like you're using the space under it. Just put this cable on the ground with the rest of your cables. Okay, inca1200. You're up. Wow me. - I'm wowed. - Oh boy. The thing is, I never wanna dunk on someone for being poor. You gotta make the best use of what you've got but those Rubbermaid containers are expensive. (Alex laughing) For the price of that Rubbermaid container, you could get an old used door and a few two by fours and screw the thing together. I don't think this is acceptable. Also, there's a mouse pad here and your mouse is on what appears to be some kind of Xbox branded box. This is not a chair. - Also like people give furniture away for free all the time. - Yeah! - Just go on Facebook marketplace, search free, get yourself a desk and a chair, please. - Wow! High-end rig 2060 and an RTX 3060, why do you have two? All right, what am I even looking at here? Holy crap! It's a Samsung tablet. Yet, another thing that I know must sell. Otherwise, Costco wouldn't carry it, but I've never seen anybody use. Sylvania, now that's a name I've not heard in a long time. With the NES! Tell me there's a light gun. There's a light gun! Are you playing some Duck Hunt? What am I looking at back here? Super into Zombicide. What is Zombicide? We got a board game enthusiast here. I love the collection. Here's my parallax virtual multiscreen setup, I set up in my dorm room two months ago. Parallax, you mean you have eye tracking and it moves or what makes it parallax? Also, this looks awful. Where's your mouse go? What is with do-- - I'm so confused. - Are there humans that are not like me that have very different length arms? - [Adam] Yeah - Well, I mean, but are they this common? I guess is the real question. Is this a sideways laptop? - Wait (laughing) - This is one of those pictures where we really do need the thousand words. That's a pretty cool setup. - The wood walls is a choice. - I wasn't gonna go after the wood walls too hard, maybe they were already like that. I mean, these appear to be like drop ceiling-style tiles. - Is this like a storage unit or something? - What is this? - [David] Love this. - I was trying to be nice. They bought the merch, you don't wanna be rude to the customers but why is your center channel behind your monitor? It's on an arm. That's not even ergonomically good for you to have your neck down like that. - But also like who cares? They're probably just using their headphones all the time anyway. - But then don't like, why is it there at all then? Holy crap! Look at these specs. This is a top of the line system, unless you're a big liar. Whoa! I love it! - Oh, damn! - Daily driving the steam deck. Wait, are you out on the porch? My most common setup currently hardly use my PC. What are you playing right now? I am not familiar with this game, but I am loving it. I mean, I chickened out but I've said, there is no reason you shouldn't be able to use the steam deck as your only computer. This is awesome. Is this on battery? Is this just a giant battery bank so you can stay out here for longer? I love this setup. Wow! That is baller as hell. Setups like this, like man, I'm jealous. I do feel like these controllers are a little optimistic though. You know what I mean? Like you don't have four friends crammed around this. What do you need all these controllers for? - Are they different controllers though, for like different games? - Xbox, Xbox Elite, can't quite tell, maybe they are just different controllers, maybe. - PS4 Switch, maybe. - On the one hand, I look at setups like this and I feel like kind of jelly, like looks way better than my setup. On the other hand, I feel a little superior because I didn't spend over $1,000 dollars on mouse. I feel smart. It's clear that some of you guys need an upgrade and if that's you, then hey, massive shout out Lenovo sponsoring this video and you might wanna check out the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Pro X. We're gonna have that linked in the video description. If you guys enjoyed this video and you're looking for something else to watch, this is not the first time we've roasted your setups, so go check out the link to that as well.",

    "description": "The Galaxy S7 Active! This beast of a phone is what happens when a Galaxy S7 and an Otterbox make babies. A rugged, durable piece of tech.  Its time to put the phone to the test.  What will happen when the screen is scratched, or the phone gets burned? Will the phone stand up to the bend test?! The only way to know is to watch the video. Let me know what you think in the comments!!  Samsung does offer top plastic layer screen replacements.  I am not sure of the cost, but if your plastic layer gets scratched, contact them to get it swapped out.  Motorola's 'shattershield' replacement is $30 and you have to do it yourself.   Here is the Galaxy S7 Edge Durability test:  What makes the Galaxy S7 Waterproof?!

    "transcript": "In front of me I have the new Samsung Galaxy S7 Active. It costs 100 dollars more than the regular Galaxy S7. And is only available on one carrier in the USA at the moment. So lets see how it survives my tests. I have a set of pics that let me know where the scratch resistance of the screen falls on Mohs Scale of Hardness. A level 1 would be the equivalent of talc powder, and a level 10 is a diamond. Each pick has a different material on the tip to differentiate between the levels of hardness. The vast majority of cell phones that I have tested end up scratching at a level 6. Unfortunately this Galaxy S7 Active scratched at a level 3. The screen is made of plastic. And that is how it gets its 'shatter resistance.' Plastic doesn't crack and shatter like glass does. I have the Droid Turbo 2 here as well, and it has the same technology. A plastic screen that scratches at a level 3. The S7 definitely feels less like plastic than the Turbo 2. I didn't think the screen was plastic the first time I picked it up. Motorola does sell replacement top layers for their phone though... and as far as I know Samsung does not. Anything metal will scratch the new S7 Active. Keys do scratch the screen. Scissors also scratch the screen... basically everything but this plastic Lego leg will scratch the screen. So keep this 'military grade' phone out of your purse, unless you want to damage it. Lets test the scratch resistance of the fingerprint scanner. It is covered in paint like most other fingerprint scanners that ive tested in the past, it does scratch a lot. If I would have stopped scratching after the paint layer, there is a good chance the scanner would have still functioned. But my scratches went into the copper-ish layer underneath the paint... which killed any chance of the scanner functioning later on. It would not recognize my finger print, even after attempting with multiple fingers. The sides of the S7 Active are made of metal. There is a light coat of paint, but no thick plastic or primer covering. So it does feel nice in your hands. The buttons and SIM card tray are also metal. The back panel has a rubbery feel to it. And the sides are covered in an extremely thick rubber coating. Before this test I just assumed that the rubber would surround an internal metal housing, but I was wrong. It is just solid rubber on the sides. When the rubber is broken, (Which was difficult to do, even with my razor blade.) the internal components of the phone are exposed. The camera lens is made of real glass, and wont be scratched by metal objects like keys or razor blades. It is also is protected by a little lip around the edge of the lens. So setting it on a table or dropping it wouldn't be a big deal for the lens and probably wont break. On the regular S7, the lens protrudes out of the back of the phone. So lets give a thumbs up for the Active improving on the lens design. Onto the burn test. The phone lasted 13 seconds with the flame directly applied to the screen. But listen close. The plastic screen melts, and pops. The thick plastic kept the heat from getting to the screen and discoloring anything like it did on the S7 Edge, But the plastic is also now permanently melted. Kind of interesting. This is where it would be nice if Samsung sold replacement top layers... like Motorola does. Either way... just make sure no hot coals or embers fall on your screen while you are camping. Onto the bend test. I have tested over 24 high end smart phones now. It is an expensive hobby. Most every single phone survives the bend test. I have only had 3 phones catastrophically fail. Make sure you are subscribed, so you wont miss any of my future tests. It is totally free! The Galaxy S7 Active is one of the strongest that ive tested so far. There is no flex in the device. Not even when I try and kink the top edge. The iPhone 6 would always flex and kink along the top, but this phone is incredibly sturdy. Even with that chunk of rubber missing from the side. It'll be interesting to see during the teardown; what makes this phone so strong. Remember that Samsung says the phone is ip68 water resistant. Pay attention to that word 'resistant'. Just like with the galaxy S7, it is not 'water proof' and Samsung will not warranty water damage or screen damage. Samsung is not guaranteeing anything, its only 'resistant' to that damage. With each phone you win some and lose some. If you don't mind spending an extra hundred bucks on an exclusive carrier, for a shatter proof but very scratch-able phone... This is the phone for you. Check out the Galaxy S7 Edge durability test video, and the video where I explain more about how exactly the galaxy S7 series is water resistant. Thanks a ton for watching! Hope to see you around.",

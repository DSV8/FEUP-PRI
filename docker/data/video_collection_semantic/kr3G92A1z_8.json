    "transcript": "Acer. A company well known for making PCS that people own for max like a year anda half before throwing straight in a river. I guess that's not quite Fair. Some of their monitors and laptops aren't terrible but anyway they've decided to dip their toes into the world of graphics cards with this very interesting cooler design I guess they're trying to overcome the hermetically sealed case designs they're known for. Let's see how it works out. Now when it comes to graphics card cooler designs the two most popular ones are blower and open air coolers now a blower design like this one here works really well in low airflow environments because you've got a single fan sucking in air and farting it out the back of the enclosed shroud design it dumps most of its heat outside of the case they also have a reputation for getting real noisy whereas open a designs provide a lot of potential cooling with all their fans and space for air to move around but if they're in a low air flow environment they're just going to dump all the heat into the case and all of your components are going to catch on fire now Acer decided to combine both these cooler designs I'm guessing with the intention of getting the benefits of both designs but from what I'm seeing here it looks more like we're going to get the downsides of both designs but again we'll see how it turns out uh this is quite nice packaging you've got this sleeve and then a very fancy box that like pops open like that and there it is wo that is a pretty cool looking GPU and there is our Acer GPU in all its Glory here's our coax fan which is very common on Modern GPU designs and then down here we've got our blower fan which I'm guessing is here for the sole purpose of adding that distinct howl now the reason that I don't think this is a particularly good idea is that because of what's Happening Here with the coax design the open air shroud and what's going on on the back here you're still going to be dumping a bunch of heat into your case you just also have a loud blower fan on here but again I'm sure the engineers at Acer are way smarter than I am so maybe this works out very excited to test it that's actually a metal back plate with a bunch of predator on the back so you can fantasize about being Arnold SWAT and Egger covered in mud in a jungle there is this kind of frosted plastic on the cooler shroud which I quite like the way it looks I mean generally I think this is a pretty cool looking graphics card and this is an RX 7600 which isn't a super high TDP GPU so just going by the size of it even if the design isn't very good I think the temperatures are going to be fine and then in terms of IO it's just a modern graphics scard but with that I'm going to go test it now but you get to see into the future where we take the cooler off and have a closer look at its internal design okay well it's finally time to tear down our Hannah Montana graphics card the best of so you just lift that off and then there are a couple more screws hiding underneath here he so many connectors three yay we've got like a copper contact plate which not only touches the GPU but also the memory and then there's a lot of thermal pad making contact with the power delivery there are four mediumsized heat pipes I'd call those it is quite a hefty cooler uh and considering that this is just a 7600 I'm sure temperatures are going to be fine but we'll see we'll see in a bit W that's 7600 die has a surprising amount of chrome bling on it uh next to that we've got our 8 gigs of video memory and a power delivery that's not a complete Abomination I mean for the price you'd kind of hope that it's not completely barebones but we'll talk about that later now starting with Battlefield 5 at 1080p ultra settings you can see that temperature- wise the problem seems to be the CPU more than the graphics card uh but I'm going to run it for a while and see how how hot the graphics card gets and after half an hour in a quick crash we finally got our temperature result so this is after quite a while of gaming granted there was like a crash in the middle of it uh but this is about where the temperature is topped out uh the CPU has stabilized quite a bit so that's good and uh the GPU is really not running very poorly in terms of temperatures and it's drawing a decent amount of power as well so I do owe Acer an apology it seems because the cooler is doing fine now cyber Punk a game that doesn't have the same inappropriate adult feelings for AMD graphics cards as Battlefield 5 does at high settings is running very well on this 7600 uh temperatures are good we're getting a lot of frame rate it feels great like this is this is a good gaming experience wait did it just it just crashed again didn't it cyber Punk crashed a lot especially the built in Benchmark a bit I could only get it to finish once out of like eight tries other games like The Last of Us seemed more stable but there was definitely something weird going on with this system so I decided to take the graphics card and drop it in my open air test bed but cyber Punk still kept crashing so it seems like Acer has continued their trend of injecting Elma into all of their products even in their graphics cards very exciting Al my realization aside I decided to drop an RTX 3060 in this system because it's currently the most popular graphics card in the world to see how these two gpus compared now I've been playing Battlefield 5 for a while now and interestingly the RTX 3060 seems to be drawing a very similar amount of power while gaming and it's got a normal open air cooler temperature-wise it seems to be doing a little bit better but the ambient temperature has dropped by about that amount so yeah very similar temperatures between the two cars which isn't impressive by any means cuz this is one of the most basic coolers you get on a 3060 frame rate wise the 7600 is a decent step up over the 360 in Battlefield 5 but again as we mentioned before Battlefield 5 is a real thing for AMD graphics cards interestingly in cyberpunk there's if anything a bigger Delta in frame rate between the two gpus than there was in Battlefield 5 which is kind of weird because that's not usually the case for this game aside from the whole constant crashing things cyberpunk feels quite a bit better on the 7600 and the trend continues with the last of us I mean you would really hope that the 7600 is faster than the 360 cuz it's got like an entire generation on that card but yeah it feels quite a bit better in these more demanding games so with that it's time to test these graphics cards in the natural environment of the Acer graphics card a terrible airflow case and what better way to asfixiate a graphics card than drop it in a pre-build now I did initially want to drop it in an Acer loser Nitro suckface Edition but I can't find mine so I guess this Aces prebuilt will have to do this system does have all the Hallmarks of pre-built dim we've got a complete lack of ventilation on the front it does have a teeny bit of ventilation on the side but I am going to like semi-obscure it just to get a worst case scenario I guess but aside from that there's nothing on the top and the only case fan is this tiny little thing on the back so let's see if Acer's Hy hbd cooler design Works any better in here than a normal Open Air Design oh what a beauty now you can see that Asus seems to think a blower style cooler is the best for this case design which makes sense it's not a very high airflow case design uh but let's drop the Acer card in here and see what kind of thermals we get before comparing it to that 360 and what I've also done here which may be kind of Overkill but I've leaned this glass panel over the side of this ventilation it's still open air can still get in there but it is going to restricted just a little bit so that we get just proper proper asphixiation going on but after starting up the system which sounds like firing up a motorbike from the ' 7s the temperature started off aggressively while it's just been a couple of seconds in the GPU murder matron and we're already close to the temperatures we were seeing at load on the open test bed obviously it's going to run hotter here but how much hotter now I've bumped it up to 1440p because we have a much slower CPU in here I think it's got an 11400 f in it and I want the GPU to be utilized fully so there you go 1440p and you can see it was a good call considering that the CPU is struggling even with this now I'm also curious how much the graphics cards impacting the CPU temperature so we got to keep an eye on that as well okay so it's been a reasonably long time and that isn't going very poorly considering the the this the situation 74 C on the graphics card it's very noisy but the temperature is good and then CPU wise we've got 77 is De C and after half an hour with the RTX 360 in there we got some interesting results the open air cooler after ages is running at a higher temperature uh which checks out it was also running hotter on the open air test bed uh but it hasn't really impacted our CPU temperature much it's still in the same region which got me thinking how much would that temperature drop with the stock blower GTX 1660ti that came in this system a graphics card that uses quite a bit less power we're getting very similar CPU temperatures and all that Heat's also being dumped out of the back of the case so it seems like in this case even the the open a style 360 wasn't having much of an impact on the CPU temperatures so at the end of the day Acer's graphics card doesn't seem too terrible until you take the price in into account I paid $450 Canadian dollar for it making it the most expensive 7600 I could find you can get the XT for that for a card I can best describe as adequate but noisy but I guess they've got to pay elma's royalty somehow which brings me to the end of the video thank you very much for watching subscribe to the channel if you enjoyed the video maybe watch another one and until the next video bye-bye",

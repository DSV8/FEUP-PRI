    "transcript": "1,400 USD, 1,400 bucks, is no small amount of money for a gaming PC, my friends, and I wanted to do something special with this build. I wanted to avoid RGB at all costs. You can still make a build look very sexy with no RGB. And if you don't believe me, allow me to prove it to you here. We've got a pretty unique combination of hardware going for us in this one. It's an AMD platform paired with an NVIDIA graphics card, and this graphics card is actually not a new graphics card. It's a used one from eBay. You can find RTX 2080s and 2080 Supers for just over 200 bucks in most cases used. And I understand that used cards do come with their own sets of risks, but for the price, I think these are well worth considering. They are excellent 1080p contenders and can even handle 1440p with some moderate settings in even newer AAA titles. They still come with 8 gigs of VRAM, they still support DLSS, and in the case of this ASUS Strix variant, they still look really good and really modern. You're not going to know by looking at this card that it's an older model because ASUS designed this thing so well. Aesthetically, it's going to blend in nicely with the rest of our parts. And as usual, you can find all of these linked in the video description. You can, of course, piecemeal as well. If you want to just take some things for your build and then pick other things for yourself, maybe you don't like the case we chose or the cooler, et cetera, just make sure to check compatibilities, clearances, and things like that, and you should be A-OK. Without further ado, let's get to it. Are you ready? Stay with me. If you're sick of seeing that same Activate Windows watermark over and over, head on over to VIP SCDKey, where they have Windows 10 and 11 Pro OEM keys at a fraction of the price of retail. Just see the secure payment method like PayPal, enter your product key into your PC settings window, and say bye-bye to the watermark. And be sure to use our offer code SKGS for that sweet discount. I think it's about time for another haircut. Look at that. You push it down, it just pops right back up. Yeah, I just can't with this. Let's kick things off first with part justification. We've got a Ryzen 7, 7800X3D. It needs no further introduction, folks. This is one of the best gaming CPUs you can currently buy, and it's not egregiously overpriced. Next up is the NZXT N7B650E. This is a beautiful-looking board, one of my favorites. It's got a matte black cover that covers pretty much the entire PCB. So it looks very clean. I think it's going to fit our aesthetic very nicely. There's no RGB at all. Just very, very elegant. Now, DDR5 has been a bit of a pickle lately for AMD because the AM5 platform only accepts DDR5 DIMMs. And, well, I don't know. Intel's opposing, I guess, counterpart platform accepts both DDR4 and DDR5, depending on the board that you choose. That has allowed folks to save money traditionally because DDR4 has been cheaper than DDR5, but that's not really the case as much anymore. You can find these DIMMs at 32 gigs for just over a hundred bucks. You can find 16 gigs for less than that, considerably less. And so I think as prices begin to simmer down a bit, it makes AM5 a more appealing platform, more than it already was. AMD tends to be pretty decent in the value department anyway when it comes to CPUs. And Zen 4 is really no exception. We've already discussed graphics cards, so now let's talk unsung hero of most PCs, the power supply. This is an EVGA 700 watt GD. It's an 80 plus gold rated unit, but it's really nothing to brag about. It's not fully modular. It's quite small. It's not super efficient or anything. The mod isn't crazy, but it gets the job done and at a decent price. For storage, we've got a Corsair MP600 Pro XT, one terabyte NVMe drive. It pretty much speaks for itself. It's a Gen 4 drive. Lightning fast. It's going to be great for booting. It's going to be great for boot and game load times. For cooling, we've got a Frostflow X240. This is one of the cheapest 240 mil AIOs you're going to find. And that is something you shouldn't be afraid of because ID Cooling in my experience makes great products. I've used some of their tower coolers in my own personal rigs without issue. Decent warranty here. You're also going to see more of your motherboard when you use an AIO in place of a tower cooler. And because this is going to be not only a powerful PC from a gaming perspective, but also an aesthetically pleasing one where it's going to be just basically matte black. I think this suits the build nicer than a tower cooler would have otherwise, which would cover up a lot more of the motherboard, the black shrouds and things that we want to keep revealed in this build. And that brings us to our case. This is a Lian Li Lan Cool 205 Mesh C, which we've actually built in before on the channel. I kept one on hand because I knew someday I'd want to build in it again. This for the price is a really good compact mid tower. It won't fit the biggest graphics cards out there, but it does come actually with two, I think it's, I think it's two RGB fans up front, which I have removed. I forget where I put them. We've got an extra two fans we're going to be putting in from Be Quiet that are going to run very quiet, as you can imagine. Otherwise, this is a very elegant looking case. It's got great airflow with a perforated front panel, and it's going to suit the other black components that we've chosen here. Kind of a matte black kind of brushed finish. That's going to look good with our motherboard, especially. Let's check this out. Hopefully it doesn't tease you too much. I'm just going to throw the motherboard in here so you can get an idea of the color scheme we're looking for. That is something else. I, I don't even, I don't even know what to say. It looks so good, this pairing. So let's get our platform assembled then, shall we? Starting first with our lovely 7800X 3D. For a CPU this powerful, I'm very curious to see how well our 2080 keeps up in our synthetic test. It's going to pull back on this lever. The socket looks oddly familiar. We've switched to LGA this time around. Some of what Intel has been rocking for several years. Carefully drop the CPU in, lower the cover, lower the lever, and yeah, we'll keep this for a rainy day. Opting for two DDR5 DIMMs instead of four for stability sake can make things a bit more streamlined and also potentially reduce our boot times as well. Now we could install our NVMe like so, but then we have to omit this beefy cover here. Let me focus so you guys can see it. So this is actually a pretty big slab of metal. I'd like to keep this on the board because it does kind of fit the contours of the remaining stuff here. So I'm going to remove this and then remove the heat sink on this and then we'll reinstall it. Next we'll tackle some cooler mounting gear. And it is already time. In goes the finished platform. I'm just going to carefully, carefully set it in like that. I think. Yep. Now we're good and lined up. I believe we've gotten all basic wiring now taken care of. We can tackle the AIO next, I suppose. We'll just get these fans mounted to this radiator. Retention bracket locked in. And now we can lock it all in from below. Just a couple tabs. We need to align. Let's see. There we go. Yep. It'll sit. And there's just one Phillips screw that's going to hold all this up top here. But that looks really good. Now for a bit of thermal paste and doing this with the case standing up is not advised, by the way. And on goes the cooler. Nice and easy. I'm just going to tighten things down with some included thumb screws. I really like keeping the AIO tubes on the left side. It can hinder your ability to install an exhaust fan. We're not going to need one here. I think we'll have plenty of airflow through the front with our two silent wings. 140mm fans that we have to install in a second. But this just, to me, looks cleaner. It keeps the tubing out of the way of the cables to the right, especially your 24 pin. If you can use a custom cable or something like that, you don't want to obstruct it. To me, this just has better lines, better symmetry overall. Okay. Maybe I should have checked that fans were actually in these boxes when I set them aside. Good thing is we have an extra couple of Pure Wings 3 fans to throw in instead. And that's important that these are 140s because we only have 140mm mounts in this case. And after this, we've actually only got two other things to install. This is moving along surprisingly fast. Quick cable manage just a bit before we get our power supply installed, which is coming up next, by the way. There we go. And it'll sit like that. Tighten it down. Wire things up. Now we could have gone with black cable extensions, but I actually don't mind the stock color here. If you want to spend extra 30 or 40 bucks though to clean things up just a tad more, that'll help. And just like that, we are onto the final step, installing the graphics card here. This again is a really good looking card. I think it's just going to be the icing on the cake for this rig. Nice matte black finishes, all around very stealthy, and we can disable LEDs on this card with a single push of a button. Easy does it now. We'll lift up on these tubes just a bit. And nice fit. Clipped into place. Oh yeah. That's a good looking pairing. Finish connecting supplemental power. Even tossed in a cheap cable bar here because our graphics card was sagging a bit. I ran out of my Lee and Lee brackets, but that's okay. I'm just going to go ahead and do that. I'm just going to go ahead and do that. I'm just going to go ahead and do that. I'm just going to go ahead and do that. But this one's fine and it's also like under 10 bucks. So check this out if you want in the description. I'll pop this bad boy back on. There we go. And here we are a very, very clean, all black, no RGB PC build. When we turn this thing on, we should only see a couple of LEDs, probably on the board, just diagnostic LEDs, but no RGB of any kind to color scheme or lack thereof in this case is just vibing so well. Speaker 1 Jean Quinn After a long community strafe. Speaker 2 Was working a couple weeks ago. Raymanier Remo. Any possibilities out therecutting the number of finished products then probably less than a 200 talked about programming a OCD and kind of frustrated wizard desperation? sort of kind of bothering me, apart from the graphics card bracket, which I think looks a bit tacky here, I'll admit, is the DDR5. Actually, the memory is a shinier kind of black finish, and everything else in here is more of a matte black. So that's how picky we're getting here, because everything else just works so nicely together. I think the graphics card and the case and the motherboard especially look really good. And speaking to this cooler, there is something that I think we can quickly do to address a bit of the extra tubing that is sagging on top of this graphics card. Thankfully, ID Cooling made this logo fairly subdued, and unless you really know what you're looking for, you won't even know this is actually right side up. You can see the I on the left and the D on the right. I'm assuming that's what they intended. However, if we rotate this another 90 degrees counterclockwise with the tube inlets, and well, tube inlet and outlet for the block at least, up top, then we'll reduce a lot of the slack and we'll have more of a spiral effect with the tubing going into the block. This will just take a few seconds. And... And if we power on here... Oh, there it goes. All right, I can hear the fluid churning in the loop. We're going to turn off this RGB right away. That looks really good. I never thought I would be advocating for no lights. We do have a little bit of a glow in the block here, but it's white. It's very neutral. This is really loud. There it goes. It's calming down a bit now. So, because this is a new system and because it's the AM5 platform, it's going to take a little while to train memory. So, if you're building this exact system, just be patient, especially with your first boot. It's probably going to power off a few times. It's just trying to get things in sync before it fully boots and loads either into your bootable media or your boot drive. Now, if we put this system through something like 3DMark Time Spy, which is a DX12 synthetic in the 1440p resolution, we'll be able to compare our results, our raw scores, with others who have also submitted through this. It's one of the main reasons I use 3DMark so much. It'll tell you a lot about your system in a very short amount of time, although it is not indicative of all gaming performance out there. Obviously, I do want to note that. I knew a few of you were going to be hesitant to even vouch for this card, seeing it for the first time in this video earlier on. And so, that's why I wanted to front load a lot of this with, hey, this is a great deal. We're not obviously buying these new anymore, but for around 200 bucks, they are compelling options. This thing is scoring consistently above 10,000 in the 1440p synthetic, which is a lot of money. So, I'm going to go ahead and find for any modern card in and around the $200 price range. And again, when you tack on DLSS and ray tracing and other things that you might be interested in, or maybe not, maybe you don't care at all, and combine that obviously with games that support those features, then you're going to have an even better experience. So, it really depends on the games you play and your expectations and certain resolutions. But I will say, by and large, this is a very healthy 1080p gamer, and will even venture into 1440p with some titles. Older titles especially should be a breeze for this card. So, we're better than ever. So, let's get started. 63% of all submitted results as is. You'll notice that our CPU and graphics card scores are around the same, suggesting that there's no major bottleneck here. Although, I will say, the 7800X 3D is definitely the true champ of this rig. And the next immediate upgrade should be, down the line, another graphics card. Now, if you want to build this exact system, or maybe want to pick and choose a few parts for yourself in a future build, be sure to check out all of these relevant links in the video description. The only one that you're going to be hard-pressed to match exactly is going to be the graphics card. I chose the ASUS Strix Rant because it's one of the best. In my opinion, AIB 2080s on the market, or at least it was when it was new, and this one cleaned up just fine. Your results will vary a bit though, and of course, whenever you're buying used, you always need to add an extra ounce or two of due diligence. And yeah, don't just buy from somebody who's plastering, let's say, retail photos or something of the card. Make sure that you're seeing the actual photos of the card you're buying. Push comes to shove, you end up getting burned. The eBay buyer protection guarantee is going to have your back. In my experience, it has always saved me as a buyer, never had any issues there, and that's why I continue to recommend them. Now, there is one more bit of business to get to before we end this video. That is the giveaway I mentioned. Well, I didn't mention it in the video, but I mentioned it probably in the title or the thumbnail, maybe both. The giveaway is not going to be of this exact system. The problem with this is systems like these that cost a lot of money and that are quite bulky, not only are expensive to ship, although we've... bitten that bullet many times before, but they're also prone to being held up in customs and other things, especially in other countries around the world. European importers usually have to pay like a VAT tax or something at customs. I mean, it can get very expensive. So, what I'm going to do is offer two different chances to win a graphics card. This graphics card is not going to be the best thing in the world, but I think for a lot of folks, it's going to fare just fine. We're going to give away two of these. So, let's get started. Let's get started. Let's get started. Let's get started. Let's get started. Let's get started. Let's get started. Let's get started. Let's get started. So, these are two RX 6750 XTs. These are great cards. Again, kind of in the same boat as like an RTX 2080. They're going to be great for 1080p, great for some lighter 1440p. They have great VRAM and they run very cool as well. A lot of these beefier AIBs really do well. This card right here isn't the exact card you're going to receive, but it will be the exact same model. And I'm going to ship these either direct from Amazon or wherever you can buy electronics in your country if you happen to win. And the details of how to enter to win are in the description. Thank you so much for watching this far into this one. Best of luck in the giveaway. I didn't mention this, but of course, based on my explanation, this is a global giveaway. You don't have to be a US or Canada-based viewer. I try to avoid the local stuff. It just rubs half of my audience the wrong way, and I totally get that. So, as long as we can ship you a card, unless you live in like North Korea or something, you should be eligible to enter. And if you're underage, you can just have a parent or leave the card. So, thank you so much for watching this far into this one. I'll see you in the next one. Whew. Yeah. Let's just end it. I keep dragging it out. My name is Greg. Thanks for learning with me. I'll see you next time.",

    "transcript": "This here is another viewer's broken gaming pc and as far as i'm aware this one straight up does not turn on which could be a number of things so this is an amd horizon based machine the exact cpu i'm not too sure about yet but we can clarify that later we're going to be swapping out the cpu cooler for a much beefier 360 mil AIO from MSI which we'll talk about in a second conveniently there's also another MSI product in here the GTX-1080 gaming this one is so good looking i love the way these older MSI cards look even just the heat pipe design looks really nice the red accents it all comes together very nicely we've got cable extensions in here which i think are a nice touch we do need to fix cable management just a bit it's a bit cluttered especially around these SATA ports and well the whole build is a bit dusty this is a corsair case but you can tell that it really hasn't been cleaned in a good while i'm not going to deep clean it in this video that's not what i was given this rig to do but i will clean it up certainly uh before returning it to the owner now for those who are new to this playlist the premise is simple we reach out to folks in the local area that's in and around Orlando Florida and ask if they have broken systems that we can fix for free we don't charge them a dime so long as they're okay with us taking on their systems for a few days and filming the process we can monetize these videos that's how i make money and i don't feel like rolling over any of those costs onto the viewer who's already gracious enough to loan me his or her system for a few days there are only two caveats the first is that i do not guarantee i can fix the problem i can typically at least figure out what's wrong but i can't always replace the component that we find is dead and the second thing is that they have to be again okay with how long this takes sometimes it could take upwards of a week especially if i have to order something in i have to wait for shipping so do you in return and occasionally we get asked by companies promote products like these this here is a core liquid k360 it is a 360 millimeter all-in-one liquid cooler from msi and they asked us to not only promote it in this video but also upgrade a viewer in the process so this person is going to get uh to swap out that smaller tower style air cooler with a beefy liquid cooler we're going to talk more about this later in the video when we install it but you can find it linked below if you are interested i think this one's going to be a fun one to troubleshoot and repair i'm not actually confident in really any of my assumptions at this point if it doesn't turn on it could be any number of things it could be something very simple could be something rather catastrophic hoping it's not the graphics card that's the one thing i can't immediately replace but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it and then the simple stuff like swapping out the cpu cooler and cleaning this thing up i think that's going to be the icing on the cake assuming we can get it fixed but even if we can't get it fixed we're still going to be upgrading a cpu cooler and cleaning things up that's the least we could do for holding onto his pc for a few days now one of the first things we need to do is power the system on and attempt to replicate the issues described by the owner we need to see for ourselves what is going on so we know where to start with our troubleshooting process power is on at the rear push the power button up top not working that's really weird though we're getting an led light from the cpu fan but our power button's not working huh that's strange so the fact that we're seeing lights from peripherals like this fan here tells me that it's probably not a power supply issue i'm not going to take a ton of time focusing on this side of it i will check connections though because if you miss-wired your front panel then your power button up front is not going to work and you'll think you have a bigger problem than you do so our graphics card is um actually blocking access to the front i o cabling this is only an M-ATX motherboard in here there's a bit of dead space at the bottom which is why we can't access it under here we need to move this graphics card up anyway though i mean this this full length 16 lane slot needs to be populated doesn't really make much sense unless you're just going purely for aesthetics to have a card this low and even then i would argue it's not really worth it so let's first power off the system i'm going to move this graphics card up a couple of slots and we'll slide it into this higher slot i've got to reconnect the cpu cooler only temporarily of course because we're swapping it out the cable was running basically right under the card there we go now this is a standard front panel header and i can already tell you just by looking at this that he has these pins in the correct spot assuming he's got polarity correct for this power led and he does so i'm going to put that one back and then we'll check the power cable the polarity doesn't matter here and the power switch is also in the correct spot now there might be a wire compromised here so what i'm going to do is try to manually jump these two pins with a screwdriver to bypass any sort of uh imperfection here with this so power supply switch has been flipped back on let's try jumping the two pins nothing still nothing wow i'm honestly kind of surprised you can see that if i reconnect this RGB cable for the cpu cooler right we're still getting an led so at least part at least part of the motherboard is receiving power uh it just it's just not turning on so we're gonna have to dive quite a bit deeper into this one so a few things i tried off camera first off clearing the CMOS it takes literally seconds that did nothing i took out one of his sticks of ram i kept one in the first slot that needs to be populated still nothing i swapped that dim with this one here it's a corsair module that i know works still nothing so i'm inclined to believe that it's not ram related and it has nothing to do with his CMOS the next thing i want to try is ruling out the graphics card as the potential culprit i'm going to remove this card completely and attempt to power the system on now a lot of these Ryzen cpus don't have integrated graphics which means we won't get a picture out but at this point i'm only worried about getting power to the system like if we can turn the system on that's mission accomplished in my book and and we can still get to that point without a discreet card in here so we're gonna remove this next i'm actually hoping that this doesn't solve the problem because if it does it would tell me that it's probably his graphics card which i think is a worst case scenario in this market but we still have nothing no power that's really really strange and just to confirm we are see yeah we're still getting power to the rgb fan here from the motherboard so i think the motherboard's actually okay it could be something related to power delivery on the socket side but i'm more inclined at this point to think that it's either the power supply itself which would still be kind of weird because we're getting power elsewhere could be a single rail that's defective or it could be the cpu and this is rare i mean the cpu is usually not the culprit but i'm inclined to test it because at this point we've only got the platform and the power supply to go but there's still one more thing i want to try before we resort to the scorched earth mentality of removing the cpu motherboard and power supply those are three of the more labor-intensive parts of troubleshooting a computer and that's why i saved those typically for last i have removed every single connection from this motherboard saved eight pin eps which powers the cpu and the 24 pin which powers pretty much everything else i also have the c uh the cpu fan here connected only so that we can see if the system is powering on i don't think there's an led indicator on this motherboard we don't have it plugged into the monitor we're not going to get picture out anyway because we don't have a discrete card in here but i also went as far as to remove the custom cable extensions and the slight chance that these are to blame although these are pretty straightforward i mean top right pin to top right pin right you're not you're not creating custom pin outs for these because they're not wired directly into the power supply but anyway i removed them just to be on the safe side we're going to power this back on and we need to manually jump the two power pins still nothing wow this this computer this computer is bricked so we're going to try the power supply next this one is a bit easier to swap out than an entire motherboard if you ask me i'm going to connect 8 penny bs and that's it that's all we've got just two connections the vital connections we've removed every other variable and we're going to connect this power supply to the wall power it on and let's see if we get power now i am expecting that we don't by the way i'm going into this i haven't tried this yet but i don't think this is going to be a power supply problem it doesn't look like a short it doesn't power on and then turn off we get steady power at the uh at least of the rgb header so i don't think it's this i don't think this will fix the issue look at there nothing no power still wow these are both connected properly yeah i think i'm thinking more cpu than motherboard at this point maybe he broke a pin installing a cpu maybe it's just seated improperly which is kind of hard to do with am4 but still it is possible so i suppose we'll need to check that out next so let's remove the cpu cooler see what we're working with underneath again i don't actually know what cpu this is it is a well this is a really nasty thermal paste i really don't like this stuff it's like almost like a glue oh that is awful it is a Ryzen 5 2600 so this thing actually looks to be in pretty good condition despite its age it's not very old relatively speaking but still it's not the newest generation so there is again the slight chance that something is wrong with this chip internally but we have yet to test it i did check the pins and the pins look to be fine i don't see any missing any bent and the socket looks good as well now i happen to have a Ryzen 5 2600 that i know works i'm inclined to swap this one out with the one in his build first to see if this fixes the issue this would be a bit faster of a troubleshooting step than would be swapping the motherboard out so yeah let's get this in there first now with my 2600 in the socket i want to go ahead and try powering things on but i want to do so with a cooler installed i don't want to just run this as is because if this does fix the issue and the system does post now or at least boot up that chip will get very hot without a cooler and i don't risk damaging the cpu or the motherboard so we're going to go ahead and take this chance to install the MSI K360 in the box we've obviously got the 360 millimeter radiator with the tubes the all-in-one cooler itself and we've got three 120mm RGB fans now there are a few really cool traits about the core liquid k360 one reason why i'm super excited to upgrade this viewer with this AIO first off the block has a built-in lcd which is customizable that's really cool i'm actually gonna peel off this plastic layer here oh so satisfying and then the other thing is that the block also has a built-in 60 millimeter torx fan which means you get active cooling to the surrounding vrm mosfets things on your motherboard that need to be cooled and active cooling always helps so you're really killing two birds with one stone here not only are you cooling the cpu thanks to the copper cold plate but you're also getting active cooling around the power delivery aspects of the motherboard so AIOs that do that really cool in my opinion you don't see too many of them in the fact that you can customize the screen up top as well is really cool so let's get this thing installed we'll set up the socket mount another cool thing about this AIO is that you can remove this front cover and you can see what's all going on underneath so we've got that 60 ml torx fan right underneath the lcd which is right here and removing this actually gives you better access to the uh the four mounting screws so this secures the block to the back plate and now we've got a good solid connection all right so with the AIO installed we've also got the pump connected i'm not worried about wiring the fans we're not gonna have the system on for that long i just wanted some circulation some way to get heat away from the cpu when it boots up we're going to connect the system to power again we've got the 24 pin and the 8 pin eps ready to go let's see if it's the motherboard of the cpu i'm thinking it's the cpu that could be wrong wow oh i forgot i didn't wire front eye out that that yep that's my bed okay here we go let's try again there it is i don't know if you guys can hear that over the uh the lav mic i'm wearing but that pump is churning the system is on awesome so my suspicions were correct he has a dead cpu so at this point we're gonna get everything wired up that was originally in his build against save the aio and uh we're gonna try for a post we're gonna try for picture make sure everything is good to go before we like totally jump on the dead cpu train again pretty good feeling that's what this is we're gonna reconnect his cable extensions i'm gonna reconnect front i o which i should have done before inserting the card anyway and with everything hooked up now i believe we can try for a post so power on at the rear there we go nothing will be synced up yet but we should at least get a picture out and i'm looking for a post i think that's possible i don't think there's any other problem with this build and there we go check it out always an awesome feeling seeing a screen like this after a long day of troubleshooting and this took quite a while actually several hours and i've been kind of cable managing working things out as we go in the back of this case there's still quite a bit i need to do i haven't secured the right panel yet but i i noticed that the motherboard was sending power to a peripheral which led me to believe that it wasn't likely the motherboard and because we were getting power to that peripheral i also believe that it wasn't the power supply the only other major component that would have prevented the system from actually powering on to any degree was the cpu and it's such a rare thing and i've said even in this playlist before it's very rare that a cpu dies but when it does the symptoms should be rather obvious at least after seeing this video here maybe you'll know what to look for if you're not getting power on at all but you are getting power to other peripherals especially through the motherboard itself might want to start taking aim at the cpu so with this taken care of we can power the system off we'll focus on cable management for this side of things but then i also want to tackle the 2600 the one that we believe is defective from the system originally we'll throw that into probably an x470 or x570 motherboard one that i know will support the 2600 natively and uh we'll see if we can get a post with his cpu in that rig so this is what things look like back here pre-cable management and this is what it looks like after spending about 20 minutes on it this is not my best work but there are so many cables being run in so many different directions it's difficult to yeah manage now i'm not sure how well you can see this on camera but this glass is super freaking dirty so uh i mean it's it's it's real gross you can tell it hasn't been cleaned in a very long time so we'll clean this up for him wow this is already looking so so much better it's a top and the front panels as well these are equally as gross something about cleaning glass that is just so satisfying and lastly we'll finish things off with a quick electric dusting this uh this build almost qualifies for a deep cleaning in the PCBC playlist but i was not sent this system to deep clean i'll just give it a quick little dusting here the last thing to do in this video then is confirm that our 2600 from the viewers rig the original cpu is in fact dead if it's not dead then i'm not sure what was wrong with it maybe it was just improperly seated though it's again pretty difficult to screw that up with am4 since the cpus themselves are keyed but here we go we're going to power this system on i've got just a GT710 here for video out since the 2600 doesn't have an integrated graphics processor and the power pins those are right here it turns on wow maybe i should have just tried reseeding a cpu before assuming that it was dead once swapping it fixed it are we getting a freaking post i cannot believe this oh my gosh my gosh all right well um improperly seated cpu i don't know what else it could be maybe he just had too much mounting pressure over the cpu cooler i i don't i really don't know what else to i don't know how else to rule this i mean it the cpu was seated properly when i took the cpu cooler off the chip was where it should have been in the socket right again it's really difficult to mess that part up and the only other variable i can think of is that maybe there was just too much mounting pressure atop the cpu from the cooler that has in the past and even even in my case more in x 299's case than x570 or b550 but still i have had it where a cpu just isn't detected properly and this the system doesn't turn on because the cooler is just not mounted properly there's just too much pressure too little pressure or whatever this is this is really catching me off guard um it's kind of why i'm fumbling my words here okay so look here's here's my thought process this board is a b450m from Asrock it works natively with 2600s okay if it was a bios issue my 2600 wouldn't be working right now and it has we've confirmed that so that's why i try to use as close to an exact match the cpu as possible and i just happen to have another 2600 laying around so mine in there works it's not a bios issue the wiring we narrowed it down to just the eight pin and the 24 pin no other wiring connected to the motherboard at all and we tried two power supplies and still couldn't get it to post right so it's not the power supply it wasn't wiring it wasn't user error in that sense the only other thing that was still installed was the cpu cooler and of course in order to get the cpu out i had to remove the cpu cool i didn't think to reapply that cpu cooler onto the same motherboard but my new cpu because i i didn't expect mounting pressure to be to blame i'm actually going to take this a step further now i'm going to put his cpu back in his motherboard i'm just i don't know what else to say i i really don't i don't know what else to say i'm kind of confused so with his cpu now in this build power on at the rear yup if you needed any more proof his cpu is just fine well hasn't this video been one heck of a roller coaster really didn't see it turning out this way i'm i suppose i should be happy that nothing in here was broken nothing in here was defective the cpu was fine i had growing suspicions that it wasn't and even concluded at one point in this video that it was actually fried until i went and tested it in another build and i'm glad i did that because then i quickly realized that the cpu wasn't actually dead then we swapped that cpu back into here and what do you know it happens to be working just fine like i said i've run through every possible scenario i even reconnected the original cpu cooler's fan thinking well maybe that fan shorted something out prevented the system from turning on that wasn't the case either we literally only had the 24 pin and the 8-pin connected and the cpu cooler connected and it wouldn't power on remove the cpu cooler replace it with this aio and for some reason it now works that's why i'm thinking mounting pressure but i can't give you guys a definitive answer and i'm sorry for that i feel a bit stupid i really do i feel a bit silly in this video i'm not gonna bother cropping any of this out i'm not trying to paint myself in any better of a light than i deserve to be the whole point of this series is to reveal the troubleshooting steps that i run through hopefully that helps those who might be in similar positions as this viewer was and you know for this to be a learning process overall i mean that's that's the goal that's why i say thanks for learning with me at the end of virtually every video with few exceptions i again i'm not trying to make myself look like the hero um i i made an assumption i i kind of followed through with that i was a bit head strong and a bit um a bit premature to assume that the cpu was dead when in fact it wasn't but i don't know this was just such a strange troubleshooting process it really didn't end up the way i thought it would and i'm still kind of confused as to why we saw the symptoms that we did but nonetheless the viewer now has a fully functioning build the build is much cleaner now it has been cable managed actually well a lot better than it was when it came in but uh significantly better than it looked once we connected the 360 ml i o here from MSI and uh yeah i think overall a really balanced build and a cool red and black and dark gray theme going on MSI's core liquid k360 is a nice addition to this build sure it's a bit overkill for a Ryzen 5 2600 i mean it's not even a 2600x it's just a vanilla 2600 but at the end of the day this viewer could always migrate this AIO to a newer build that beefier builds something that consumes a bit more power outputs a bit more heat and it would just be right up this 360 io's alley i really dig the integrated screen the integrated fan both of which are in this cpu block it is insane how much they've packed into this block here and uh the fans look super sweet as well with their RGB support you can learn more about it in the link below and i said that earlier but it is one you should strongly consider for your next beefy pc build hopefully with this video you were at least somewhat entertained i'm also hoping that you learned a thing or two but um i'm i'm leaving this one feeling again a bit silly i don't really know what else to say it's a bit embarrassing i'm kind of i'm kind of stunned that this ended up playing out the way that it did look we fixed it but it was a pretty messy process along the way and um i'm still not entirely sure what happened but at least the viewer can go home happy with a clean system fully functioning and with a pretty sweet upgrade courtesy of MSI if you guys enjoyed this video be sure to give it a thumbs up i would appreciate that consider clicking the subscribe button if you have not already let me know in the comment section below what you thought of this video and what you'd like to see next and i will catch you in the next one my name is greg

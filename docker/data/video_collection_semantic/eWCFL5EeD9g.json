    "transcript": "Deep Breathe. \"Takes Deep breathe\" whats up Guys? Lou here back with another video and today i have something in front of me, as usual. but this time i have no idea what's inside. in this case i see this symbol which looks aggressive and scary. I mean it says battle box on it, okay! and i sort of know what it is it is a survival box, or at least there should be survival slash tactical gear inside of it, but I had no idea exactly what it is. We're gonna find out together in classic Unbox Therapy fashion Woah what is this, hay? what are we working with here? Grass? Is this dry grass? already found like a little blade thing it says MIL on it, i think thats military, we will find out battle box survival in tactical gear cool alright so it's a subscription box they send you one every month well here you can see the value of the various boxes I think we have the Pro Plus, either the pro or the Pro Plus what is some kinda like renewable packing material im gonna place that down softly okay cool! we have the Survival Guide here. The department of the army field manual, Whoa yes! my five-year-old will is really gonna like this. identifies various creatures, this is cool alright so you keep this with you, and all of a sudden you can survive in the woods or at least that's a step in the right direction, the Kershaw black wash series, i think this is a knife? \"WOW\" pretty solid dare I say, a new un-boxing knife? Whoa oh, that's no joke, don't try this at home! look at that! it even cut's through the organic packing material. its got a little clip on it. it's got a frame lock on it, you see right here? its what holds the blade up gives it rigidity structure, to put it down you just push that over to the side, and clamp it down. nice little package I like the color too, rugged looking metal finish... Solid! next up, emergency blanket up to 90% reflection of body heat really? \"wow\" its kinda like uh, foil? i probably shouldn't use this right now, like i should save this for an emergency it's hard to believe that a material that thin could reflect 90% of your body heat. alright I need to save this for real survival situation What is this? it's a mirror a survival signal mirror with a little compass in it flash this off the Sun hold the mirror close to your eye, slowly turn and angle the mirror so the aim.. indicator is on the object you wish to flash you, your flashing people??? from a distance so they come to help you this is an old school compass \"wow\" when I was a kid I always wanted a legit compass like this look at this thing again tried-and-true old school tech! doing the job solar charger for iPhone and cell phone, now everybody here certainly understands that so it's part of the case lay it out like that there some old-school phones listed on here, Nokia n70, Motorola v66, Sony Ericsson k750 I think I had that phone. It's got micro USB thats the important one of course, little flashlight LED, flashlight probably needs a battery! \"ohhh!\" this is cool! aquamira, frontier emergency filter water is a big issue when you're out there trying to survive you might see a stream or something and you're like damn that looks clean and I just wanna drink from it well there is some bacteria and whatnot thats in there, no good! you don't want them your going to get \"umm...\" diarrhea? so this this little joy here this little arm filter with a straw allows for you to drink the wilderness water... The wild water active carbon helps reduce water-borne chemicals and it also improves the taste \"ohhh\" this is cool too, a fire starter kit right here this \"oh\" this actually has some signals imprinted on it, various smoke signals for emergency situations you strike this thing I believe with this other side of the object or with a hard surface a knife blade something like that and you can create sparks fairly easily that's probably what this grass is for eat, eat-n-tool, eat-n- tool what a name a rugged, stainless, outdoor spoon, fork, bottle opener screwdriver, pry tip and metric wrenches and a carry carabiner does everything... that's cool that's way more useful than you might imagine, life and death situation! where you spoonless, forkless carabinerless, bottle openerless you need that, this is a can opener isn't it? yes its like a military can opener, AJ from the control room agrees this is a can opener, but if you found a can of food during the zombie apocalypse that's like that's Gold its a gold mine right there! you know what? listen, you guys have all the tech and gadgets in the world can you even survive? didnt think so, look at how rugged this all looks. instantly more rugged, rugged meter elevating survival and tactical gear, alright that wraps this up, thanks very much for watching guys, If you enjoyed this content make sure to leave a thumbs-up down below and I'll you catch you very shortly in the next episode Later... bottleopenerless...",

    "transcript": "- [Ken] Oh, (bleep) that wasn't supposed to happen. GNOME is a little more of a resource intensive desktop environment, as many have pointed out. Downloading 37 of three. Well, that's not really the kinda math I would be doing, but maybe it's just going above and beyond. (electronic timer) (upbeat electronic music) Well, I was just trying to do a tiny bit of preparation before filming the next tech video login. Yeah, Solus seven-hour download. That's not looking too good. Yeah, just my luck, right? Well, I guess we'll have to switch to a torrent download and that should be a lot faster than that. It's only 4:48, right, so let's see. Seven and 1/2 hours or so. Yeah, we could start filming at midnight, sure. Not a problem, not a problem! I've used Transmission before, I just didn't have it on this current Mac OS installation, and we're back with it. It looks like two minutes now. Well, that's a lot faster. Thank you Transmission. Well, now that that's out of the way. Hey guys, how are you all doing? Really, that's just great. You know, I'm doing pretty great today too because it's Linux day. I get a lot of suggestions for different software to try, specifically different Linux distros. Solus has been going around the suggestions box recently, so I thought, well okay, I suppose I'll try it. Actually, I'm glad you guys suggested that because I wanted to try Ubuntu Budgie recently and well, Solus Budgie the default desktop environment, so perfect. It looks like there's a GNOME version and a MATE version as well. But we've messed with those in the past on other systems, so for the first time we're doing Budgie on Krazy Ken. I'm gonna image my Lite hacker flash drive. A lot of people say this looks like some kind of PC destroyer or virus flash drive. I guess it looks a little Lite hackish, but I don't know what the big deal is, I just got it from a shadowy figure in a van. I mean, no problem there, so I'm sure it works just fine. Let's plug her in, and we're gonna load up Etcher. So where are we gonna be installing this? Well, as you can probably see over here I have a Lenovo Notebook setting because I still have that pile of them and I only gave a couple away to some people. I still have a few left, so I thought why not throw it on there? All right, I cannot read it properly. Update notifier sleep days of undefined. Okay, well, not really sure what that's supposed to be. It was probably doing an automatic update check and it had a little bit of a boo boo. So we're gonna ignore that, we're gonna take our image throw it in there, it automatically detected the Kingston, and we're gonna DC Flash this boy. Type in the password, don't look at this part. Le voil! All right. So I'm gonna shove you over to the side like so and I'm gonna get this Lenovo ready to go. You know what might help? If I actually plug it into power. So I'm gonna pop it into the USB port on here and boot her up. So I have put other distros on this Notebooks before, like I said, but one of the big issues is I usually have some performance problems and that's probably just because GNOME is a little more of a resource intensive desktop environment as many have pointed out. And yes, I could use GNOME Tweaker, I probably should do that in the future too. But I wanna try a different desktop environment this time, hence Solus Budgie, and it's not powering on so something must be wrong, okay. Well, I suppose we hit our first speed bump already. This machine just refuses to power on. Let's try a different one. So maybe this one will work. Oh man, you need a birth, dirty computer. Okay, get over there. Let's see if it turns on. Honestly, if it's a little dirty I don't care, I just want it to turn on. Okay, that's two that won't turn on. I think this charger is bad. I think we can do a little process of elimination and assume the charger is the culprit. Shit! Well, thank you curse, I think you broke a charger. Let's try a different charger. Okay, stop, stop, stop! Hold the presses. I just dug around for a different charger and this one has more of the clover shape. The one I'm trying to use has more of the snake eye's shape. So I somehow, got a bunch of chargers mixed together, but they are different. So, I'm guessing this one just straight up doesn't work with the model, we'll just go to the clover one. So that's good, maybe the computers aren't actually bad, it's just the wrong charger. Never mind, we can cross that idea off the list because the connection that's attached to the power supply with the clover, adapter, thingamajig doesn't even plug into this computer. So we must have been using the right all this time, but it won't turn on. Like neither of these are turning on with it, so that's a bit of a problem. Okay, hang on, plan G. I'll figure this out. I seriously don't know how it's scientifically possible that the curse has already (bleep) this up so much. We've hardly even started, can't even turn on the computers. Oh my gosh! Am I doing this wrong? Like this should be pretty easy, right? Shit, I don't have a charger to go with these Lenovos. A viewer actually offered me one, I might need to take them up on that now 'cause I feel like when I gave away the other Notebooks, I gave away the other chargers leaving me with one that doesn't fits, and now one that does fit but doesn't work. Hurray! All right, well, not a problem. We'll just have to skip the Lenovos for now and go to the Mac mini backup computer. So all right, back in a sec. Oh my gosh, it's gonna be a long day. We're gonna go back to our Mac Petri dish, the good old Mac mini. So I have Solus on the flash drive. Let's boot her up and test it out. Of course we'll be doing the installation sensation, but as per tradition, we will take the system for a test drive. I will install a few things, test the performance and I've actually never used Budgie before. I also had some suggestions to install some things to get some more Mac OS-esque features. So I may experiment with those too. Fun is to be had, and right now I need to check the signal cable. What the shit biscuit! Source. Well, that explains the problem. I'm digging the sweatpants today. And here is EFI boot, which is our Linux flash drive and let's see what we got. Cool, it detects Mac OS and then we also have Solus 3.9999 Budgie. Well, let's do it. I know I mentioned I never used Budgie before but I've actually never used Solus before. I wanted to save it for now because it's been recommended to me. Now that is a pretty wallpaper. I am a huge sucker for shallow depth of field, a lot of book action. So here we are. Here's our menu, we got some shortcuts down here, notifications, nice and smooth animation. Nice little easing there, it seems to be working just fine on the Mac mini here. Let's do an install before we do too much of a test drive. Where are you? Well, I'm right here, but that's probably not very useful to you. English US, actually wait! Okay, yeah, there's no English Macintosh specific, that's totally cool. Let's see. Select. I see timezone. Let's do. This mouse really sucks. (laughs) Wow, that was a god guess, Chicago right there. Examining local storage devices. I like this little loading icon, that's pretty. Oh yes, I have Ubuntu 18.10 on here. I'm gonna replace the Ubuntu installation keeping the Mac OS partition untouched, hypothetically and just do that. What name should this computer use on the network? Krazy Ken PC. Oh, they must be lowercase, I'm sorry. How about that? Yup, that's our only hard disk option so we'll go with that. Who will be using this device? Krazy T Ken. Actually that's the username, hang on. Krazy, and the real name will be Krazy T Ken. The password will be of course aligator3 and aligator3. Did I hear like a little whoop sound? Hang on. So there's the pop sound for the volume. (volume popping) I like it, I really like the way this desktop environment looks. It's really pretty looking, I like the color pallet too and the flatness, a little bit of shadows going on here, so far so good. Krazy T Kren (laughs) oh-la-la-la-la-la Ken, here we go. Da-da-da-da-da, summary, boom, done! Installation will make changes to-- Oh, cool it's, the dialog box sticks on the window, it's semi-transparent, very nice. Could result in data loss. Yes it could, some of that is intentional. Some of that I hope does not happen. Now, come on, give me a little slideshow of all the cool features of Solus Budgie. No slideshow? Okay. I'll just be over here all sad. Looks like we're about to complete here soon. I'm just going through my notes here. Plank, that looks like what we should install to get kind of a dock like feature. Okey-dokey! You may now exit the installer. Restart and then remove any installation media to start using your new operating system. Well, thank you, that's so polite of you. I'm gonna restart now, and usually it will prompt me to yank the flash drive out. Oh, it's already gone. The flash drive is blinking on the back. I don't know if I wanna yank it out while it's doing its thing. But I believe this is our Linux system here. I didn't even get like a startup screen. I guess that's normal. And here we have some more beautiful flowers, very nice. Let's log in. As part of the installation sensation, before we go into a full test drive we should get any updates and drivers installed too, just to make sure everything is peachy. 'Cause I don't have this thing connected to the network yet so, yeah, it definitely wasn't able to download any updates during the installation process. Let's fix that. Okay, that looks like it's just for ethernet. Uh-huh, what about Wi-Fi? Search for Wi-Fi, and there it is, piece of cake. Oh! (bleep)! (laughs) Oops! That's a problem, there is a Wi-Fi card built into this computer, but it is not finding it. And ethernet is not really an option right now. So this actually might be good timing to announce that I actually have a backup dongle now. United Way actually owned this, and while we were making the PC episode with the Windows 10 installation, he told me behind the scenes like, hey, I have this Wi-Fi dongle. Actually he mentioned that in the episode. This is the dongle, he doesn't need it anymore so he gave it to me and I guess I could use it in situations like this. Now, the funny thing is though, when he brought it to me, it was in a little, it was like wrapped up in a napkin inside a sandwich bag. (laughs lightly) It just looked like garbage. It got thrown out, I totally missed it. So now him and I are looking for it, and one unlucky contestant had to dig through the garbage, like an actually big bit of rubbish. And it was just sitting in the garbage bin surrounded by trash, and he fished it out. So thank you for getting that, 'cause it got thrown out by accident. That's just amazing. Okay, tragic back story over. Let's plug this in and see if it works. Did I miss something during the installer? Was there like a driver button or something that I missed? Because this is bullshit! Oh! Yeah, that might be useful. (laughing) In some cases you may gain improved performance or features from the manufacturer's proprietary drivers. Note that Solus product developers cannot audit this. Yeah, that would be useful. Son of a bitch! I was like, I feel like something is missing. The following dependencies need to be installed to continue. Absolutely, you do your dependencies, you do that. Okay, well, that should be an easy fix. (laughs lightly) Oh my gosh. Bong! I'm gonna miss that startup sound, Apple is killing it off. Also, I heard that the T2 chip prevents Linux booting on newer Macs as well. So yeah, what we're doing may not even be possible on, for example, the newer Mac mini which has a T2 in it. I know Apple just wants to kinda control their brand and protect their computers and protect the users that don't know any better. But, son of a bitch! For the people that do wanna tinker, like that's just kind of a slap in the face. Am I supposed to do something here? I would say I am confused, but that's not anything new. Speaking of Grub, I could go for some Ramen, yeah. I don't know if the asylum has Ramen though. Okey-dokey artichokey, let's see if this works. I could probably take that dongle out. Hopefully, we don't need that. So yeah, there is ethernet, don't need that either. Let's try \"Wiffy\"... it's actually pronounced \"wy\"-\"fy\" Ralph. You asshole! (laughs) What! Oh my gosh! I just installed the driver, did I not? (stammers) what! I thought I literally just did this. So I hit up a forum and this person, Verbatim, has the exact same problem I have. They installed the system, the driver thing popped up, they typed in their password, they rebooted. Still the same issue, no Wi-Fi is detected. That's exactly what is happening to me. So I'm not the only one this has happened to apparently. And to add to the coincidence even more, someone replied saying they just bought a USB dongle off the internet. Hmm, where have I heard that before? That's the exact same thing I just did and it's still not working. Good grief man! Well, for shits and giggles, I wanted to try installing one of these packages to see what it would do. I didn't really expect it to work, because there's no network connection, but now the Software Center is frozen. Can't even drag the window around. Well, that's nice, that's really nice. These terminal windows are really pretty by the way. Let's just try, this keyboard is slightly unbalanced, so it's really noisy. Yeah, it's trying to fetch it, but it can't because there's no network connection. It's trying to download a driver to connect to the internet, but it needs to connect to the internet to download the driver. What am I missing here? What did I not do? I've done plenty of other Linux distros and it just works. I don't know why this one is being such a dick tease. All right, let's see, yup! I'm running the latest Linux kernel 4185 release 90. So it's not like it's missing something there. Again, I don't have access to a router that I can just plug this in through ethernet, and I can't use my MacBook Pro with internet sharing because it doesn't have any ethernet port and I don't have an ethernet adapter. Actually, there's one other thing I could attempt. I do have another operating system on this computer, so let's just do ... Let's see if we can just get the package from inside the Mac OS, put it to a flash drive and then try installing it inside of Solus. Text Editor, is pretty much all I need. All right, so we're going into, I believe Mountain Lion is on here. Kind of an old OS, but oldie but goodie. Yup, that's the Linux installer, we will ignore that and we'll go to Safari and try to manually download this because the Wi-Fi works just fine on here. Well, I manually entered in the address and I'm guessing it's not really gonna work on Mac OS regardless, but it give me a 404 page. This is the webpage I was actually visiting on my phone and yes, all the links do go to a 404 page. Which makes everything so much easier to figure out. (laughs lightly) Okay. You're just enjoying watching myself and you're probably like, you are such an idiot. Oh my gosh, this old top sites interface. Wow, yeah, very old version of Mac OS on here. Yeah, okay, honestly none of this stuff is much help at all and a lot of those links, actually like all those links just go to 404 pages. So I'm just gonna have to wait until I can get a hold of some devices, a laptop to use internet sharing or something, just to get this thing temporarily hooked up with ethernet access to do the installations. Because doing it offline is apparently not working so well. I guess I'll have to come back to this. All right, who wants tacos, you? Okay, let's get some tacos. We'll come back to this carp later and then we'll have some fun. (mellow guitar music) Wow, shit! Almost just knocked everything over. While I was having my tacos I had an EpiPen, epiphany. I had an epiphany! I have this old computer laying around. Wow, it's getting kinda dirty. Shit, I gotta clean that. I have this old computer laying around which has internet sharing capabilities in the OS and it has an ethernet port on the back. I can just use this as the quasi-router. Okay, six in the (tapping) power up on deck. I also tossed away that Belkin mouse and got the gold Apple mouse back which I know people are probably gonna complain about, but I like it, it actually tracks way more accurately than the piece of crap Belkin. We have internet, let's see, right there. Share the connection from the Wi-Fi to computers using ethernet, turn that on. Start, okay, let's switch back to the other computer the Mac mini, and see if it works. Slowly shove you to the side. All right, let's start up Solus. And if this works, everything will be so much better. (laughs lightly) Why? It looks like we are connected, that's a good start. So let's take a look at that driver and see if we can actually install the Broadcom driver now. Oh, and security updates available. See, when you're connected to the internet everything is better. Look at that shit! Oh my gosh, this is all I wanted. This is all I wanted for Christmas. Actually, I'm gonna get back to that stuff later, I'm gonna do this one first. Linux kernel imaging modules. I don't remember two things showing up in there before, but okay, maybe it's because it's connected to the internet now, it knows what to do. See, there, now it's actually doing shit. (laughs happily) Look at that, I managed to save the day boy. Oh, shoot! Yeah, this software is a little weird. Like, it should have given me a warning saying like, hey, you're not connected to the internet. Instead of just saying like, hey, it's done. Restart to continue. That was just misleading, the terminal told me though. The terminal was like, yo you got a problem and that helped so much more. Downloading 37 of three, well, that's not really the kind of math I would be doing but maybe it's just going above and beyond. It doesn't look like it's doing anything. Shit! It's not moving. Oh, you Solus Driver Management! It is just not working. Okay, let's do those other updates first and then try that one. Please check back later, updates are now applying. This is like the most entertaining indeterminate progress indicator I've ever seen. Whoa, it's so spiny. Software is up to date, fabulous! Now let's try installing that freakin' Broadcom driver. For crying out loud, just please work. Oh, now it only shows one dependency so that might be progress. Oh, that was way quicker. Boom! Restart. Well, that doesn't look normal. Seriously, after like all the driver and software update shit I just literally did, it still can't find the Wi-Fi adapter. Yeah, this is a weird one, this is really weird. I just wanted to enjoy a pretty interface and maybe some games, maybe Plank to install dark type of thing. No, instead we're still trying to connect this thing to Wi-Fi. Yeah, that's great, that's great. (bleep) this! We're just gonna ignore it. I really don't care anymore. Let's just (bleep) have fun now. We're just gonna keep the iMac over there and install shit. So, la-la-la-la-la, go to the Software Center. Ha-ha-ha-ha, gaming on Solus, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. Oh my gosh! Oh, Super Tux Cart, frick yeah! Let's just install that for shits and giggles. I don't think I've ever played this. We'll install some stuff then we'll explore the system. We gotta customize it a bit right. Budgie looks pretty, so let's customize it up a bit. Budgie desktop settings, let's see what we got here. Oh, icon theme, high contrast, high color, HiC. High Sierra. I'm just kidding. Oh, dark theme, yes please. Oh, that looks pretty, oh yeah! Bottom panel, let's see. Applets, settings, oh, lot's of stuff in here. Yeah, let's just make that thicker, just for the LOLs today. Transparency, dynamic. So does it like? Yeah, it goes opaque when you go, maximize a window. Makes sense, yeah, let's do that, why not. Shadow, let's keep that shadow on there that looks pretty cool. When in dark mode the panel will use the minimal amount of space possible, so it will like shrink into the center. Oh! Yeah, that is kinda more darkish. I'm guessing these are Applets, yup! Because here's Raven. I'm guessing that's what this little sidebar thing is, and these are the Applets, and here's the notifications. That looks really nice, the button layout. Left, oh, now I feel right at home with Mac OS. (laughs lightly) I don't know if I've ever done that on Linux before, except for when I use Pear OS, the buttons might have been on that side. Attach model dialogs to windows, we saw that earlier. I'm cool with that. Desktop icons, yes. Network service, trash, let's put the trash on there. Now that feels like old school Mac OS. Mounted volumes, I always like having the volumes on the desktop, although it doesn't look like they are showing up anywhere, but oh well. Oh yeah, speaking of trash, let's put this in there because we don't need that, and let's put this down here so it really feels Mac-y. And it looks like for applications we do have Rhythm Box, Firefox and other things that rhyme with ox. Different view modes, menus, quit, about and finals. Da-da-da-da-da (clicking). Yeah, maybe it is its own thing. Andy Hertzfeld. Wait, what? Like, the Andy Hertzfeld from Apple? Does he work on this stuff? I guess I never really paid attention to his history after he left Apple, but shit, okay. I don't know, is that just a coincidence? Is that the same Andy Hertzfeld? All right, well, now we can actually browse the freakin' internet. Let's go to thecomputerclan.com. I always like to do this, I always like to put one of my photos as the wallpaper. I have some new ones I have not put on a website yet. I really should do that. Now this is the one that was on the iMac earlier. I've used this one a few times. I really like this one, let's do this one. Yup, let's go to our files, let's see what's going on in here? Okay, so now this is showing up here. Let's do in the background. Yeah, why not? Let's install Google Earth, because I don't know what the earth looks like. And we'll set this as our wallpaper. Bling! Nice little crust is off there, hell yeah, little touches. There's Plank in here. Oh, yeah, there it is. All right, well, I'll install that after (laughs) Google Earth does its thing. And of course, let's get Steam on here. I did get a recommendation for installing Steam. Linux Steam integration, so that's a thing. Oh yeah, Linux Steam integration, helper for enabling better Steam integration on Linux. Well, son of a buck! Okay, we'll do that first and then install Steam itself and I don't know exactly what this package is gonna do, but we'll test out some games, I'll get Plank installed as well. We'll just have some fun and make it kinda Mac-ish. Actually if we're gonna do that, if we're gonna install Plank, we should do this. So we have the dark mode, we have the buttons on this side. Those things already make me feel like I'm in Mac OS. But the bottom panel should really be set to the top now. If we're gonna put a dock down here, we might as well put this at the top and have it act like a menu bar. And just really skinny it down, make it opaque. But yeah, having the notification stuff over here and the notification Raven thing here. This feels a lot more like Mac OS. (keyboard popping) My Apple keyboard volume buttons are even working just fine with cute pop sounds. Now, I know down here it says install Google Earth. This may take some time, but it's been a long ass time and it's not doing shit. Come on, I think I've broke it trying to install freakin' Google Earth. Why are you being such a meany head? Yeah, I think my Linux guy said that he just uses the terminal to install this stuff. I don't know if he gave me a reason why, but if I had to give him a reason why it's probably because this is really finicky. Like you install one thing, it grays everything else out which I guess I can understand, but it just gets stuck. It's just frozen trying to do a simple installation. Yeah. That's just stupid, it should work a lot better than that. Come on, man! Oh, visit website. I'm gonna give it one more try, see if it works before I resort to the terminal. Now, was that so hard Google Earth, if that is your real name? Yeah, it worked immediately here, so go figure. And there it is, that was simple. There we go, now we have dock, look at that. That is really cool. Keep in dock, nice. That is awesome. Theme, oh! GTK! Let's actually make this bigger so we can see it more. Just for the sake of sharing with you folks. We have mate, transparent, GTK plus or default. Well, and teller hide. (laughs) I guess that's a thing. Honestly, on Mac OS I auto-hide my dock. Docklets! Oh, so you can put the trash in there. Ooh, I like how that moves, it's kinda cool. Yeah, well, I don't need you on the desktop anymore asshole. You can just piss off over here, I'll remove you later. CPU monitor, that's pretty cool. Can I drag from the menu? Oh, hell yeah! I wanna put the file browser in, oh, I can't. Well, okay, F you too. I'll just do it this way, I'll open it up, right click, keep in dock and then hopefully, I can just drag that over here, and let's download Steam. Wants to extract the DEB file. No, that's not what I need to do. I need to run the DEB file. No, you shouldn't need to. No, (bleep) that. Hang on! Where did it even download to? You asshole, I don't even know where it went. I feel like this is not what I should be doing. Instead of going to the website to do it, I should really just do it here. Downloading 29 out of 209. Oh, there's Linux Steam integration and there's Steam here. I wanna open this up, what does this actually? Okay, hang on, I wanna see this. Use native runtime, use the intercept library. Maximize compatibility I suppose, get that going. Look at that cancel button. Now, that is a nice cancel button. You spend months crafting a gorgeous cancel button. Hill Donne, I spelt my name wrong, Hill Donne. I don't think that's ever happened in my life. The cool thing is they send this stuff really quickly. Like there are some services that are like, oh, we'll send you a key to your email and it takes like 15 minutes just to show up and it's like, puff! Steam is just like (snaps) done! 'Cause they have their shit together. Oh my gosh, all these notifications, I don't-- Oh wow, okay, I have no idea what's even happening. Let's slow it down. (laughing) Oh, stop! Stop! Okay, I remember this blue thing is new-ish. I don't really know. Oh, there's some unread things in there. I'm in the middle of tech video log, I guess I'll just stay online, whatever. My go-to testing ones are like Super Hexagon and Lost Cause, but I kinda wanna do something different. I tried Stanley Parable in an earlier episode but it did not wanna work, it just won't even launch. I think I've done Portal a few times before. I don't wanna too much Half-Life 2 stuff because I still wanna save all of that for my potential gonna happen live broadcast where I play Half-Life 2 again after not playing it in years. So I don't wanna spoil anything. Garry's Mod though, that would be fun. Well, yeah, that's gonna install. I don't think I can play Super Hexagon while it's installing 'cause it's just gonna pause it, I think. Yeah, it's queued. - Super Hexagon. - Yeah, it's queued, but whatever. We gotta do this, it's like, access the Steam (laughs) da-da-da. Access the Steam! It's kind of tradition that we gotta test it out at least once. I know we're queuing Gmod, but whatever. (Super Hexagon gameplay music) Oh, that was bad, that was bad. (Super Hexagon gameplay music) Ah, sometimes it's harder on a bigger screen because it's, your eyes gotta move so much more. So change the window, yeah. Let's see how crapy I do now! (game control tones) (Super Hexagon gameplay music) Yeah, I do worse! That's not possible! (laughs) Asshole! (Super Hexagon gameplay music) Curse you and your catchy music! You know, (bleep) you too, I didn't even wanna play you. I wanna play Gmod, so we're gonna get back to that. I have a lot of memories of Garry's Mod, not good memories. Well, while that's going let's explore other stuff included with the system, because we haven't really done that much. Super Tux Cart, oh, I think I installed that earlier and I forgot about it. (laughs) Yeah, let's do that. Uh-oh, I just I think I just launched it like three-- Oh, oh, oh! Whoa! No, no, no, no, no! No! Shit! I feel like 3,000 instances of Super Tux Cart. It's gonna freakin' take over the world. No. No, no, no! Get outta here! Oh dude, it's loading like the old Mac OS, where the icons would just pop up on the bottom of the screen. There's probably another operating system that did that at one time too. Amanda the Panda! Now, this course looks cool, let's do that shit. And Garry's Mod is done. I should probably have looked up what the controls are for this. But I'm guessing it's probably WSAD, or it's the arrow keys. Okay, so the forward button. Okay, it's the forward button, it's the up-arrow and then the arrow keys, okay. There's probably other controls that I should know about. Oh, the space bar is my horn, okay. Honk-honk, move I will lose it. The 3D actually looks pretty nice on here. Oh wait, was that banana a power-up or was that a hazard? I really don't know. Now I wanna play Mario Cart. I'm gonna hit the banana. No, it was a hazard, I knew it! I shouldn't have hit the banana! (bleep) you banana! Let me grab the present, there we go. Okay, space bar! Space bar activates my power-ups. I now have a force field, bitch! Oh, somebody just exploded over there, serves you right. I have a parachute, which I don't know how to use. I really don't know how to trigger the parachute. Is this nitrous or something? Oh, that was a bowling ball, wrong sport. That's a different sport. Let's just drive off the edge. Can we drive off the edge? Whoa! That brought me back to some Mario Cart days, playing on a tiny CRT television with a four up view so your player window was like 320 by 240, or whatever. Tiny ass window trying to play a game. Yeah, it's got 65 items to install. That's probably a very small amount compared to what most of you all have. It could probably just ... Oh yeah, none of my maps are gonna show up. The performance is a little laggy, but I probably haven't really optimized it too much. Plus it's still downloading stuff in the background. I think the motion blur is on. I usually don't even like having motion blur on, honestly. Yeah, let's turn that off. I love these explosive barrels, let's make a shit ton of them. Shooting them certainly won't cause any problems, right? Oh! Maybe that will. It's lagging the shit right now. While it's doing the add-ons. Oh! Oh (bleep)! That wasn't supposed to happen. So performance wise we know it's definitely not the greatest stability. It probably crashed just because it was chocking on the performance and it was trying to download stuff in the background. I should also probably turn some settings down, 'cause again we're not really on a high end system at all. Very beautiful. Oh, so that's my default player model. That makes a lot more sense now. (laughing) Okay, Bonzi Buddy isn't here, are you freakin' kidding me? Oh my gosh, it's been way too long. (laughing) We got Mike Claude as well. Nuclear Warfare, the redeemer. This one is a lot of fun because you can shoot a freakin' missile and then follow it from the missile's point of view. You see that? That's a lot of fun. Now, this is a really small map to be doing this in. This is probably very dangerous, I'm gonna hit myself. (laughing) Oh yeah, we exploded, that's good. Let's go to an apartment, because we can. Smaller map would probably also perform better. Yeah, that crash earlier, I think that was just an anomaly. I think it crashed again. Okay, maybe that wasn't an anomaly, it's just having some stability issues. That's enough of that, let's see what else is included on here. Library Office draw, Firefox, Google Earth which is grayed out 'cause it probably did not install properly. Looks like we have Library Office. Oh, partition editor, that's always nice to have. Oh, authentication required, absolutely. Yeah, this was fun. Once we got it actually working online, we had some fun with this, tweak the settings made it look a little more Mac-ish. I'm pretty chill with that. Ooh, calculator! My favorite. Yeah, there were some roadblocks in this one, but overall I'm gonna call this mostly a win, I would suppose. And I am open to suggestions about other Linux distros you want me to try out. (electronic beep) And I just wanna thank my Linux buddy, Kiwi. He's kinda showing me the ropes about this stuff. And I appreciate all of you guys. Thanks for watching. Catch the crazy and pass it on. (upbeat electronic music)",

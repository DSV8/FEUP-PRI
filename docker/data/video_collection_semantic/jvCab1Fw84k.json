    "transcript": "What's up guys? Lew here, back with another video, and today, I am finally checking out- the new Google Chromecast. This is part of Awesome Stuff Week here on YouTube, and today is... Must-have Monday, I've been a big fan [of] the chromecast for a while, using it; (of course) to broadcast all kinds of different content! Up to your flat [panel] display even doing something I like to call YouTube DJ-ing with friends and family, where different people take control of the Chromecast from their device, and Show their favorite videos. Sometimes appropriate; sometimes not so much... Well the new Chromecast is more of the same, but in a new design, (as you can tell) here on the right hand side, you can see some [of] the Supported Services Streaming services, that can be broadcast from your device through To the chromecast [on] the back here you can get an idea of how they set up works. It's pretty simple. You [can] see on your phone; You actually get a little icon allows you to take anything you're watching and then broadcast it [onto] your television. HD streaming from the cloud surround sound support, screen mirroring from Supported Android devices, and laptops. That's cool, and of course it supports Android devices, as well as iOS devices. So iPhone, iPad, Mac, and then Windows as well and Chromebook. Oh cool, okay? So the packaging, is actually the instruction manual; as well here you can see how to get started simply plug [into] power as well as your television [now] some Tv's have a powered USB port on them, so you won't actually need to plug into the wall, and then chromecast.com/setup On your device. he device is pretty simple. Magentic. Of course, your HDMI connector here, (on the actual unit) you have a micro USB port; (of course) the HDMI for Transmitting your video as well as your audio, and then a power button over here. We have our power adapter as well as our USB cable alright, so that pretty much wraps up the unboxing now. I shall connect to this chromecast, give you a better look at the interface and also cast some things; [ok] so I have a display here I have the chromecast plugged into the display now. It's time for [setup] and it prompts you right away scroll over to devices here, and it'll show [the] available Chromecast. You can see it verifies the connection. We're now connected over here as well. Do you see the code? Yes? I do after [the] fact you're going to connect the chromecast directly to your network. So anyone on your network can interact with the Chromecast you can browse. Your own apps that you've already got installed that are chromecast capable so in my particular case, I have Google [Play] Google Plus, MLB NBA, Netflix, UFC, YouTube, Etc. This [is] the Magic that [is] Google Chromecast if you are unfamiliar from the phone, (no longer on the phone); on the big display. Super simple, super easy, and really to be honest; with you, all displays should have something like this. Actually the quality is pretty good, as well. One of my favorite things to do is to set up a cue like this, so kind of want that lean back [YouTube] experience for example. You can use the YouTube cue to set up a bunch of your favorites, and they will automatically cast in sequence. So you can watch one, after the other. This also works really well for playlists series, things like that, and what's cool is- if you have some subscriptions to like MLB At Bat or What is it, NBA [gametime]? And whatnot, so you can see up here; right within the app. There's a chromecast button, we can connect to Jack's cast; this game will begin shortly and now like I mean this is- this is really cool. So I'm taking control of even a live experience, like a live broadcast through the MLB app and I'm broadcasting that to any display that this- fairly inexpensive device, is connected to I can see- these things being functional for a number of different users. Regardless of what your area of interest is, it could be sports; could be MLB; could be YouTube; could be Netflix, but essentially this is probably the most streamlined and cost-effective way to get stuff that you're doing on your phone, or tablet or laptop up onto any display? That's really what the chromecast is all about this is [an] expanding marketplace. And they've made it even easier to interact with this device. I'm gonna watch this game. That's what I have to do. Hopefully [you] appreciate it content. If you did make sure to leave a thumbs up down below. Subscribe, if you haven't yet for more content like this. Thank you very much for watching, and I'll catch you on the next episode later guys.",

    "transcript": "- Hey guys, how's it going? It's Justine, and today I'm answering the question that you guys have been asking me for months. Everyone has already done their iMac Pro unboxings and I've been so excited for this computer, but mine isn't here yet. When they originally announced the specs, there were rumors the iMac Pro with 18 core was going to be delayed. I wasn't gonna let that stop me. Because usually whenever I get a computer, I end up spec'ing it out to the max, because I put these things through pretty much a torture test every single day editing. Especially with my MacBook Pro. Almost all of the videos that I edit in the past year or so since I've got that MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar, I've edited everything on that. I shoot everything in 4K and I edit almost everything off of solid state drives. I don't necessarily always edit on the computer, because I'm always so afraid of one, losing my computer, two, the hard drive space filling up because there is only two terabytes on there. So usually when I shoot a video, what I'll do is I'll put it all on the two terabyte drive because that's what I'm gonna edit off of, and then I make a backup of that on a separate drive. Now that I have my server, I basically dump everything onto the server first, then put it onto my two terabyte drive. If I happen to be traveling and editing, then I usually like to have an extra backup of that in case something happened to the drive that I was editing on. But the question, and the reason that you guys are here is which iMac Pro did I get? And if you guys have been following me on Twitter, there was a slight little bit of a hiccup in the messaging of when my computer was gonna be delivered. I got this email. It said, \"Justine, congratulations! Your iMac Pro is on the way.\" And then within 24 hours, those hopes and dreams were quickly ripped away from me faster than you can say, \"Hey, your iMac Pro is gonna be here. Just kidding.\" An email had prematurely went out to everyone who ordered the 18 core iMacs and it still has a February ship date. What is it? (gasps) My current ship date is February 5th through February 19th. And the reason for this is the 18 cores were delayed. I feel like pretty much everyone I know that has ordered one has already gotten theirs, but I was crazy and I went for the 18 core, the 128 gig RAM, with the four terabyte solid state drive. And I was kind of crazy because, to get the four terabyte solid state drive, which I know most people didn't even opt for, it was like 23 hundred-some dollars extra just to get that four terabyte drive. Which makes sense because it's solid state. And right now solid state drives are extremely expensive. But because this computer isn't really that updateable, I had to update it to the max. Because I feel like, for me, this computer is gonna last me for a very long time. I say that and then, as soon as I get another computer, you guys are gonna come back to this video and it's going to haunt me. My words will haunt me. But anyway, I'm not gonna sit here and justify why I bought an over $14,000 computer. Because I'm not sure if I'm sane. I don't know if that was a sane decision. I don't think it was a very good decision monetarily. Pretty sure I probably could have spent $14,000 in investing in a Bitcoin mining farm, but that's a whole 'nother story. My entire life basically revolves around Apple and technology. So for me, this is an investment. An investment in my future. An investment in the future videos that you guys are gonna be seeing. I'm still trying to justify in my mind (laughs) how much I spent on a freaking computer. Well guys, that's the answer to your question. That's the iMac Pro that I got. I got the spec'd out one. I'm super excited. I'm still trying to justify to myself that it's okay. It was an okay decision. Make sure you guys come back. Stay tuned for the unboxing. And you gotta believe that I will be doing some tests of exporting from my MacBook Pro, an iMac 5K. I know that I don't use Premiere, but I would love to do some Premiere tests as well, because I know I have a lot of you guys that do edit on Premiere, I have a lot of friends that edit on Premiere. So I'd love to see how Premiere and Final Cut stands up against each other while exporting and rendering videos across the MacBook, and the iMac, and the new iMac Pro. So I'm gonna stop rambling. I'm just gonna go, think about what I've done, and I'll see you guys in my next video. Bye! (upbeat music)",

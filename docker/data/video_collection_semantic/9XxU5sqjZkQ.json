    "transcript": "- Hello, welcome to \"This Is\", Matt, what do you have there? - What I have here is the 2020 edition of the Blade Stealth 13. So I've been a hardcore Mac user for since about like 2006 ish. And I've tried several times to go to Windows. I always hated the devices I'm on. And it's not a Windows thing. It's always the the laptops I'm using, but now with the Razer Blade Stealth 13, This is the first time I'm like, Okay, this is my daily driver. - So Matt, I spent a fair bit of time with the early 2019 version of Blade stuff that was my daily driver for a while and something that really strikes me about what Razer does with the Blade or the entire series of Blade laptops really is the level of quality and not so much in like the the quality of like, you know how powerful it is or anything but in the actual build quality. So I think someone who's coming from MacBooks you could probably appreciate that Razer one of if not the only company who do the same sort of laptop design that Apple does, right they start with a giant chunk of aluminum, they mill it out and then in Razers case they do a very expensive anodization process to really make it that sort of super clean matte black look which honestly I feel like makes it the best looking laptop period. I mean there's just nothing else like it - Yeah I'll be honest I'm very vain when it comes to laptops which is why I like the MacBooks they're just, they very clean look having basically a just a matte black MacBook Pro. I'm just I'm absolutely in love with it. Like, I don't think there's any other device on the market that looks as good as the Razer products here. - The Blade Stealth still takes advantage of 10th generation Core i7 processor, which is solid, they have upgraded this time around so now is running at 25 watts instead of 15 watts which To be fair, the model that Matt has right now is a pre-production sample. So we can't run benchmarks on but that should give a little bit more performance. But what makes it more special is the fact that not only is it the very first laptop with the brand new 1650 Ti but also finally has a 120Hz screen option. - I'll say that I got used to Only being 1080 pretty quickly, going from 4k to 1080 you know it didn't, didn't bug me that much. After like a couple days, the smoothness was really nice. And I did play a few games on it, especially like Rocket League. - I just feel like 4K is unnecessary on a 13 inch screen. Like when you look at the PPI on 1080p that's small, like I 've always been 100% fine, like my XPS 13 I use the 1200p option. For me, I would rather have the battery life that comes with that lower resolution. And I would especially in this case like to have the extra smoothness cause that makes such a big difference for gaming and well for both everything I guess. - You know, actually what I was missing the most is I had never had a touchscreen on a laptop before and so I kind of got used to that with 4K model. - Because the 120 is actually only a it's not a touchscreen - Dude, I ain't right there with you. Every time I use a Windows laptop without a touchscreen, I end up touching the screen without thinking. Like it's not like the most important feature in the world, but just being able to just like scroll through a web page or something makes Such a big difference. - This feels like just a slightly larger iPad to me. You know, as far as like when I'm sitting down with it on the couch or something like that. - [Interviewer] But do want to explain the difference in the shift keys that has driven everyone crazy. Yeah, so it sounds like a really dumb thing. But when you're actually going to use it, I was ready to pull my hair out. So in last year, self they had a shortened right shift key, which sounds really dumb on paper that this would be a problem. But when you were going to type just naturally where your finger would try and hit the shift key, it was actually hitting the up arrow and so this year, they have gone with a regular size shift key in the normal place. And then they did like kind of the half up and down arrow keys, which works really well for me, I think there's just like a perfect keyboard layout now - The thing for me is that the Blade Stealth is always or at least for the last few years occupied a very unique spot and that this is a 13 inch gaming laptop. Now obviously with it being smaller, you've always had to sacrifice performance right? This cannot hang with the 15 inch Blade for example, which has up to double the cores much big for your graphics and well the graphics are better the 1650 Ti, it's a Max-Q. They were quoting it somewhere around like 10% more powerful compared to the old 1650. So not a massive difference now before the quite expensive price tag on the Blade Stealth was an issue but it was kind of okay and it was kind of justifiable because when you look at 17, $1800 laptop and I know that the 120 Hz model starts at $1800 this year, there's no competition right? So it's kind of like well, it's expensive but it's hard to say however, we recently did a video on the main channel on the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14. Now this is a slightly larger laptop. It is a 14 inch design as opposed to 13 but it comes in at 40 and $50 with basically full on like Blade 15 style specs, right? So you've got an eight core I's and nine you've got a full RTX 2060 MAX-Q, you're getting significantly more performance and it is in a form factor which is not wildly bigger than the Blade Stealth. - Yeah, now I'll admit, that's like one of the things that I really wish, that Razer would embrace would be doing something like, you know, having Ryzen systems. I don't see that happening anytime soon because a lot of especially with the stealth because a lot of their ecosystem is , you know, being able to do Thunderbolt going into eGPU, which is, to be fair how I use this, if I want more power, I just plug it into a eGPU - when you look at a laptop, which is not that much bigger, not that much thicker, significantly cheaper by several hundred dollars and much, much more powerful. It's a bit of a tough sell. Like if that Zephyrus never existed if AMD hadn't caught up in such a big way with Ryzen I think the Blade Stealth a bit. Oh look, it's a great update to one of my favorite small gaming laptops. But now, I know about you, Matt, and I know that you have used the Blade Stealth in the past but for me, I'd rather carry that Zephyrus I feel like it's a better overall deal at the moment - For me, like I said before, I just really don't like the look of a quarter unquote, gaming laptop, and I still feel it, the Zephyrus is still, you know, it's understated a little bit. It's definitely not one of the most, you know, egregious for being a gaming laptop, but it still looks like something I don't wannna to really like, bring to like a meeting or something like that. I understand that part of the reason this cost so much more is the is the build quality. I know that you were talking with Razer and they kind of explained their anodization process and how expensive-- - It's crazy. Like you wanna you want to explain that - It's a very, very nice premium feature, but it also adds significant cost. Now when you're looking at some like a Blade 15, which has to be $2,000 Plus, you know, another hundred $200 on the build isn't the end of the world when you consider everything else. But when you look at something like the Blade Stealth which obviously is playing in that sub $2,000 category, then you're like, Oh, you know what, that is a very significant chunk of the budget right? - I'm not gonna say that this is a value machine, but in like in my opinion, it's just getting something this beautiful and this powerful in a small form factor. is good for me? - No. And I totally I totally understand that. And I don't want to hate on the Blade Stealth. Also there is the fact that you can go down. If you don't need the GPU, you can go down to get the integrated graphics model, which still comes in that sort of white slash silver finish. That's cool. That's great, right. And I've always appreciated Razer products for their design, it's just to me that before, I was kind of okay with the price, because there was really no competition, you could not get another laptop with that sort of same size. And that sort of level of performance, it just really didn't exist. However, now there is one and it is just the price, the value proposition just for me, went from being like kind of okay to just like not really acceptable anymore, which sucks because the Blade Stealth is a very, very cool laptop. And if they were able to knock off even like another hundred $200 off of it, I think it would be a really compelling value proposition. - Now let me ask you this. How much of that do you think is because they're using Intel versus, you know, - yeah, so I don't know. Obviously, none of know how expensive these components are right? So the graphics are likely, well the graphics are certainly cheaper because they're you know, it's a 2060 versus a 1650 Ti so certainly the graphics are cheaper. I wouldn't be surprised though if AMD would provide Ryzen chips for cheaper than Intel, that to me sounds about right. The Blade Stealth is a great laptop and I feel like for many people it is a very solid recommendation. But for me personally and I think for a lot of people if you're okay with putting up with a slightly larger design, what you're getting is something which is cheaper and more powerful and that's that's a really tough combination to argue against. - I will tell you the deciding factor for me sticking with the Razer laptop versus literally any other Windows laptop out there is the trackpad. I think it's better than the MacBook trackpad personally. - Now, I'll give you it's good trackpad. I still feel like it's not quite on the level of a MacBook trackpad but it is it is very good I'll give you that - It's little things like that. The key travel on these like the the keyboard I think it's just a perfect feel for me. The trackpad is just a perfect Feel for me - No one is going to pick up the Blade Stealth and complain about the keyboard now like it is a perfectly competent respectable keyboard. I'm curious Matt, so obviously the Blade Stealth has some advantages in size but I feel like part of the reason why we're even doing this video was, you had a lot of thoughts on switching from Mac to Windows right?, like beyond the hardware ,Have you found yourself able to use the Blade stealth to replace your MacBook to do things like you know Photoshop and some of the more like productive tasks that you do for \"This Is\" - I would say right now I'm about 80 20 going from Windows to Mac for just in my daily life. So for a while I was only using the iPad to do any of the productivity things for \"This Is\" I was using I was doing all that on the iPad but now I find myself doing all those productivity like email. You know writing in we use Google Docs. I've been doing that all on the Blade Stealth and really the only thing I have been going back to Mac for is the creative thing. - I feel like the Blade Stealth is certainly a small gaming laptop first and everything else second, I think it does a good job of being an Ultrabook. Right. So, like when I had my old Blade Stealth, I didn't really play that many games , I definitely carried around with me everywhere and wrote a lot of documents and, you know, that kind of thing. But for me, I will give it some credit that it is certainly a smaller design. I just think that at the end of the day, it's tough to justify spending that level of money on a laptop, which is very good, but is not as powerful as I think it ultimately could be. And I think that kind of holds back that value proposition. - Again, I can't argue that point. I know that like on paper. I love the Zephyrus more than the the Blade Stealth but when I got my hands on both of them, this is the one I ended up going with. - Well that's a excellent way to end this episode, This is thank you guys very much for watching this quality quarantine content I'll be over here without the Blade Stealth and I guess Matt will be over there enjoying it and flexing on everyone who doesn't have one yet. Although Razers gonna make you send that back you realize it's pre production, right? - I will say with the anodization process I do notice that this one versus the old one, the edges are very sharp. - Yeah, I mean dude that is like one of the very first models off the line. So of course Big thanks to Razer for letting us borrow this one at least take an early look. But until next time, Matt, do you have any parting words for your Razer fanboy following - No. Subscribe to \"This Is.\" - (laughs)That's it. That's as creative as you've got. - Thank you.",

    "transcript": "Hi there, this is mrinal once and welcome to RTT videocast. Nowadays, technology has become deeply integrated with our life We use technology so extensively that we dont even realize we are using it. . For instance, you want to go for vacation book a hotel or train tickets online want to meet your friend in a new city ask them about their GPS location even if you want to eat somewhere we first look for its online review. Now, my point is Since we are using technology like all day long why not use it more effectivly So here are 5 android tips that will help in your next trip. Before we start, let me warn you these tips and tricks come from my personal experience so take it with grain of salt and dont expect it to work all the time And with that being said lets get started. 1. Save mobile data Saving mobile data is our prime concern while travelling overseas. Now, some of you may not know but international data roaming is like 20 times more expensive than regular plan. for instance telcos like AT&T or vodafone charge like 30$ for just 100 MB of data So the best way to overcome such situation is to buy a local sim the moment you arrive your destination Basically, they are available in most airports and you need to give a photocopy of passport and this can save you upto 90% on your carrier. But if thats not an option there here is how you do it. One way to save bandwidth is by restricting internet access to apps Like, if you dont want gmail syncing in background or weather widget updating itself on your precious mobile data. then turn off background data, by going to mobile datas settings Or if you are too tight budget, install apps like mobiwol this will let you to specify which apps can access internet like I only want allow reddit to connect to internet then I can whitelist it. However, me personally I dont like to go too far, restricting background access is OK for me. Another way to save data is by detecting where its used most and then optimizing that Like for me, its chrome, that eats most of my data so what I can do is Turn on data compression on chrome or you can use opera mini browser. Its known for its data saving algorithms However, chrome is not the only thing that eats data, you have apps like reddit, facebook, instagram and what not so how do you optimize these other apps? Well first of all uninstall Facebook and messenger app its the hands down the most data and battery consume app ever Instead use Facebook in your browser for few days, it will make a lot difference now to optimize data of your other apps you can use data saving app like Onavo Extend this will compress all the images and text that you received from the web. overall its quite powerful yet very few people know about it 2. Google maps offline Google maps is another necessary evil. Its must have app while travelling but while using it you battery and data will drain like water from the sinkhole. So make sure, to save all you destination offline while you are still on Wifi And the good new is last month google made a big change to their maps app in android Now you can save an entire city (or even a state) on google maps earlier it was limited to small part of a city. and thats not all. now it also support destination search and turn by turn navigation on offline maps. But, this is all, easier said in a video but what about practical use how good are offline maps when you dont have data. can you totally rely on it? Well, to test it reliability, I download the offline map of city like jaipur and delhi. which was quite reasonable in size i.e. the whole Delhi NCR region was covered in 250 MBs And when I reach my destination, I asked my friend to WhatsApp me their current GPS location and then I turn off my internet and use the offline maps for navigation And everything work fine, even though I was offline the entire time. So overall it was a pretty good experience. However, if you are frequent traveller, I would suggest you go for here maps instead. Because unlike google maps, here is totally available offline and gives you more accurate direction in the countries where google maps cant. 3. Use evernote for note taking The first rule of traveling is to have both offline and online copy of important documents like IDs, passport, tickets, bills etc etc Now, I know most of you have it on your emails but thats not a good practice what if your internet stop working? Well, I highly recommend you use evernote. Its a simple note taking app which is available in all platform Now, I using it religiously for years to curate ideas for my videos and blog post but I also use it for taking logs while traveling For instance when you open the app, you can create a new notebook and then scans all the bills, ids, travel tickets directly from it no need for apps like camscanner to keep track of your expenses you can create a text or voice note, and the best part it, it will auto sync when it sees internet so you will have backup of all that. Overall, I strongly recommend using evernote for everything not just for travelling. 4. Save photos Everyone loves taking photos especially while travelling. but by the end of the day, we dont have enough space left on our phone. This is common problem, right? so what you can do is, try apps like CRAM it uses special data compression algo that reduces the size of your photos to 60% So if you photos weight like 1 GB, it will convert them to like 500 MB without any significant loss in quality or cropping it. However, the only problem is the free version support 300 photos and then you will have to pay. now, there are other alternatives but as of now, I havent seen any app which is as good as cram Also since Google photos now support unlimited photo backups make sure you enable this features, So even if you delete all your photos from mobile it will still be available on cloud, However, make sure you sync backups only on WiFi (which is by default) or you will run out of you mobile data But if you going to place where you will not have WiFi then taking a physical backup is the only option. Most smartphone these days, support OTG cable. Right So simply connect your phone to a pendrive and move all your photos/ or videos to the external drive. Now, if you like me, you can even automate this with tasker so whenever you connect your pendrive to your smartphone via OTG tasker will run the script and automatically cut and paste images to the pendrive. 5. Prevent phone for being stolen or lost Now this is something we already know but often overlook it due to heat of the moment Like showing owner's info on lockscreen, in case any one want to return your phone, they will who to call. However, not everyone is a honest these days, so, you need to plan for that as well. First steps is to encrypt your phone, so, if your phone goes in wrong hands they wont be able to see your personal data without knowing the unlock code. and even If, they reset the phone, all photos and app data will be delete. now, I often charge my phone on public places like a coffee shop or railway station in such case, I use app called anti alarm theft and what it does is if someone tries to move your phone form charging or even when kept unattended then this app will raise an alarm. But frankly speaking, these are just fancy things, if your phone is gone then its gone. I know, because I have lost 2 phone in past. So the only thing, I rely on is cerberus. this one is paid app but you can use the trial version for few weeks. Now If you watch my video regularly, you will know what cerberus is, but if you dont, then If you phone is stolen or lost, it will take automatic picture and record GPS location when a wrong PIN is entered. If the thief changes the SIM card, it will automatically send you SMS from new sim card. and best of all, it can survive a factory reset on a rooted phone. so in a nutshell, cerberus is the best protection you can get. well this is all for now To see the list of all travel apps I mention in this video check out the first link in the description or click on youTube cards on the video Also, In my next video, you will see a channel update and what plans do I have in future so if you have any other question that you would like me to ask in this channel update or even laters ones then let me know in the comments below i will pick up comments with maximum upvotes and answer them in my next video. So this all for now Give this video a thumbs if you have enjoy it or thumbs down if you havent Dont forget to subscribe to see more tech tips and tricks And like always thanks for watching.",

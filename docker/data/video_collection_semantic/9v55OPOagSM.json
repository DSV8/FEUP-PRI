    "transcript": "so I'm sure most of your sub boxes are filled with Galaxy Note 10 videos and if you're disappointed with the announcement I wouldn't be surprised because I am in fact if you interested in our coverage you can check it out right over here now in that video I mentioned how cheaper phones or lower priced phones are starting to become really good and I think that's where galaxy a50 comes in now the launch price for the a50 was three hundred and fifty dollars but you can pick this phone right now for as low as two hundred and seventy dollars that's right two hundred and seventy dollars now when you hear of that price you'd think that it would come with a cheaper build quality terrible display underwhelming camera performance poor battery life less features compared to its flash of sibling like the Galaxy S10 and more but having switched to the Galaxy a50 for a little while now I'm actually really impressed with this phone in terms of what it offers for the price and it also made me realize how cheap phones are getting good and that quote is becoming very popular these days so allow me to walk you to my experience using the galaxy a50 right after this what would you like so I'm looking for a gaming headset with a bit of everything but not overkill something that folds on your neck sure how about the light frame without excessive clamping force yes yes you comfortable ear cushions with proper internal padding excellent I will take the cable and the microphone are removable fine fine this is the one multi-platform compatibility with virtual surround sound dongle avail can I just take one and the sound quality you'll be satisfied with so the new Coolermaster MH 751 and 75 to are here to make your gaming experience ok so the first thing I noticed right after picking up the a50 is just how good it feels in the hand the back side is made out of plastic but they've done a really good job replicating a glass back finish like the s10 now one of the advantages of having a plastic body is that when you accidentally drop it chances of it breaking or shattering are very less likely to happen compared to a glass back design I remember the note 9 days folks it was not fun next up is the display and this is one of the best features of the first and foremost it's completely flat so you don't get any curved screens like the galaxy s 10 which is awesome it also adds a sense of confidence when holding the device or grip if you want to put it that way the screen itself is gorgeous it's six point four inches 1080p Super AMOLED display the colors are vibrant you still get those deep blacks and felt like it was using a flagship Android device which is very impressive I will say that it is slightly larger than the s10 it's actually almost the same size as the s10 plus so one hand operation might be a bit challenging for folks with smaller hands Samsung decided to ditch the punch hole cutout on the a50 and instead went with a tiny drop style notch at the top kind of like the oneplus 6T and some other phones it's not really distracting in fact if you want you can hide it through the settings so that's nice you only get a single mono speaker at the bottom and that means you can accidentally block that with your finger so it could get a little annoying now sound quality itself is not that great I certainly experienced some distortions and high frequencies and it just isn't really the best experience so I'd highly recommend pairing this phone with a good set of headphones for a comfortable experience also this might seem like a bonus from the s10 but there isn't a dedicated Bigsby button on the a50 so that's good plus the volume rockers and the power button are located on the right side they're easier to reach and the quality of the buttons are on point the exabyte good tactile feedback so no complaints there now you can pick up the Galaxy a series in different sizes but the specs and camera layouts are a bit different depending on each model it starts with the 810 and then goes all the way up to the a50 mind you some of these models are carrier explosives depending on region so I'll make sure to leave links to what I can find on Amazon in the description down below at the lowest price the a50 variant that I have over here comes with an ex nose 9610 octa-core CPU four gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigabytes of storage the good thing is that you can expand that up to 512 gigabytes and guys this isn't the fastest phone out there the specs are on top of the line and that's to be expected for the price but keep in mind that specs don't really paint the entire picture it's again all about that overall experience when using the phone and having used this for a little over a week it's actually pretty good albeit multitasking performance is the biggest drawback and I think that's due to the inclusion of four gigabytes of RAM and when you pair that with Samsung's one UI it does tend to struggle here and there the in display fingerprint scanner is also pretty slow when it comes to unlocking the device I've run into a lot of issues where it just wouldn't recognize my thumb so I had to rely on the old-school pattern unlock method now there is face unlock and it's a bit faster but it's really not secure and it's a hit or miss at times you'd have to be really patient when using a Galaxy a50 say for instance if you're someone who is straight up used to cheap phones let's say a budget of less than $300 and if you don't want to spend a penny more and if you don't care about apps loading up the instant you tap on them the a-15 won't really disappoint you but if I were to compare this to the Galaxy S 10 you aren't going to be losing on some features like wireless power share wireless charging IP 60 of water resistant rating you also lose on stereo speakers telephoto lens as well as getting the fastest SOC and the sharpest possible display so with the a 15 what you're really getting is a phone that does a lot of the basic things right now before I get to the camera performance I do want to quickly talk about battery life and in one word it's amazing so the a50 features a four thousand milliamp hour battery and when you design a phone with a relatively powerful CPU which is the Exynos 96 10 4 gigabytes of RAM and a 1080p display I was easily able to push this guy to two days worth of use on a single charge I mean check out that screen on time it's it's impressive so with that out of the way let's get into those cameras now don't fool yourselves thinking that the a50 comes with a triple camera setup like the s10 and the s10 Plus that isn't the case in fact all you're getting is an 8 megapixel ultra wide-angle lens any 25 megapixels standard lens the one at the top is a 5 megapixel depth camera that complements a live focus which is Samsung's version of portrait mode as for the pictures I was pretty impressed reviewing them one by one the fact that they included a wide-angle lens at this price point is very to see on a phone in 2019 the samples you see here have a good balance of contrast and saturation you can play around with the wide-angle lens to get some distorted interesting and weird looking images it certainly lacks detail and Samson's post sharpening effect doesn't really do that much I should mention that you lose focus control when shooting wide-angle so that's a bit limiting the main camera shoots decent photos but it lacks consistency you see this is a wide-angle shot it's a bit underexposed but when I switch right over to the main camera the white balance is off it's slightly overexposed and when you have HDR turned on in some cases yeah it doesn't really look that real if you're patient enough you can get away with some great shots in daylight portrait mode or light focus works pretty well again it's not pixel three a good but if you're a casual user sharing on social media you'll be fine low-light performance is pretty terrible but I expected that there's just no detail and it's almost similar to the Galaxy S 10 so I can't really complain here but having looked at these samples what do you guys think is it impressive for less than $300 so this is the video test on the Galaxy a50 and guys as you can see I can use the ultra wide-angle lens on this camera to shoot video unlike the 1 plus 7 Pro that does not which is kind of stupid right yeah and Mike here is cooking us some delicious dinner and you can see like the colors are really nice and vibrant I think the details also there I think is also really good too I mean Samsung's always really get a lot of focus with their cameras on phone so it's really good I think it lacks a bit of dynamic range because you can see the skies are like kind of rushing the shadows it seems like exactly what rusty alright so switching to the front-facing camera test on the galaxy a50 and guys I'm actually pretty impressed to put what this phone can do in terms of video now it tries to expose or tries to compensate for exposure and there depending on the situation and as I'm walking you can also get a rough idea on how it looks I mean there isn't stabilization with the front-facing camera as far as I can tell but just you know looking at the samples as well as the V equality let me know what you guys think about the camera samples in the comments down below oh also this is a good test for the microphone as well yeah so I guess this brings me to the conclusion and guys I'm really impressed with a galaxy a50 you see the biggest Forte of this device is that gorgeous display and the battery life I still can't believe how Samsung was able to implement such a beautiful AMOLED screen at this price point now it's not packed with features like the galaxy s 10 but this phone offers about 50% of that experience for 270 dollars and if you can find it for that cost great but if you see these floating around for $350 just do yourself a favor and spend an extra $50 and pick up the pixel 3a the camera performance is pretty good and I'm happy to see the inclusion of a wide-angle lens now when it comes to actual performance like using the phone I keep your expectations low because this isn't a multitasking champ and when it comes to software and software updates Samsung phones are really not known for getting the latest and greatest updates so that is something to keep note of but I really want to know her thoughts about the galaxy a50 I mean if you can pick this phone for $270 would you actually consider doing it or would you spend an extra cash and pick up something like B pixel 3a there's also this other phone called the retina K 20 probe that's been generating a lot of hype right now so there's that and of course we have that note 10 announcement which was definitely a slap in the face but phone market man it is what it is so that's it for me thank you so much for watching and I'll talk to you guys in the next video",

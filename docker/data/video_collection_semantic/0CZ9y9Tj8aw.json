    "transcript": "- Hello, and welcome to This Is, are you one of the sad boys like me patiently waiting for your Steam Deck email to show up? Well, we got you covered today because we have a whole bunch of handouts that aren't the Stem Deck - The Playdate is here, hello The Playdate is the Steam Deck killer. You think if I took a Playdate and smashed it into a Steam Deck, it would break the Steam Deck? - I think this is the Nokia of the modern era. These things are incredibly well built. - Do not break my Playdate - Your Playdate? - One of the things that you're gonna find with almost all of the items that we're talking about here is that they too are difficult to get your hands on, thanks chip shortages. But if that Steam Deck has been elusive for you we actually do have a pretty good selection of things that you may wanna consider. - They all have pros. They all have cons. The con for most of these is the price. So we have a couple different things we can do. We can start with the Playdate. This here is the most unique gaming device that I think I've ever been a part of - Very Game Boy reminiscent. - Let me read the specs on this guy. This is a 400 by 240, 1-bit screen. So it is just black and white, but it is a very nice screen. - If you ever spent time with original Game Boys you'll know that there's a certain blurriness to the screen because it's very low pixel density. This is roughly double I believe the pixel density of a normal Game Boy, which means that the individual pixels are sharp and importantly, the contrast is good. You don't have the stupid little wheels you're adjusting but the other thing is this like a Game Boy and unlike everything else we look at and everything else that's been made since the year 2000, does not have a backlight screen. A big downside to that is that of course if you're in the dark, you can't see, but on the other side not only you have great battery life when you're outside but the screen looks better the more light that you can throw at it. So if you're hanging out the car window - If you were a nineties kid like myself you know the pain of driving on a road trip at night trying to play by the street light as you pass by because if you dared turn onto the backseat light, your father would go, I can't see anything. You're like, dad, I'm about to beat the elite four. - Nope. - I can't see. That will be a problem with the Playdate. What else makes the Playdate unique is that you don't buy games for this. - Well sort of. So if you buy a Playdate, it comes with one season of games, which means that games would be delivered. I actually don't know. Do you remember exactly how many games there are in season one? - The way it's gonna work is there are 24 games in that season. These are not massive games. These are maybe like you might get a couple hours out of them. - Yes. Some, I think its like a 10 minute thing some or there's a little bit more to it. A lot of them do take advantage of the little crank and the fact that this thing is not only delightfully designed and you can hear that plastic - The best hardware to, oh, there it is. awesome smell tips. - It smells great too I'm not talking about feet. So you can't complain. - Why is feet in every episode? Speaking of feet, a common misconception with the Playdate is that the crank is to charge it. It is not, it is an input device. The music in it is really good. - It's so good. This thing is cool. Now, the problem with it is price and availability. - Yeah. - So it is $179, which when you consider it comes with a bunch of games, isn't maybe crazy but it's certainly not like a throw away $50 little item or something like this is something that is designed for distinguished gamers of taste and also it's sold out like massively. - So according to their website the production capacity for 2022 is full, totally sold out. - Mind you, this is just the way that life is at the moment. It is very difficult to secure production capability between chips and shipping and all that kind of stuff. So a lot of these items, if you put your order in now you're gonna have to wait a while. But the Playdate is a very unique, interesting product. It's really kind of the anti Steam Deck in pretty much every possible way. It's a very focused, simple, I would say almost gimmicky kind of thing, because it's very much kind of a one size fits all. You're not gonna play Windows games or anything on that. It's very much like, oh, oh, give this thing a try. - I have a feeling this is gonna end up on our shelf as like a display piece more than it would be an actual game that we carry around in our bag. It's hard to justify that price for what you're getting with that. - Speaking of justifying the price why is there an Apple logo on the back of the Aya Neo? - Because Jared is Jared. - Oh yeah. Okay. So this is the Aya Neo. Now, if you're looking for something that is going to replace your Steam Deck this is about as close as it gets right now. We actually did a little piece on this for mystery tech a little while ago, you can check that out for something that's a little bit more sort of in depth. Essentially, this really is a Windows powered Steam Deck. I'm just gonna put this right up front. This thing is expensive. It is $1,415. - Did you just say $1,415? - Roughly a thousand dollars more than a Steam Deck. - What?! - They definitely have a fan base and some of the things that are in advantage here, it runs full Windows right out the box. So unlike Steam Decks, which it runs Windows but it's not a great experience. It really kind of treats itself like a Windows laptop, right? So you have a touchscreen, you have quite nice controls. It also has like a very similar kind of display. It's not quite as powerful as a Steam Deck. So it's actually got more CPU cores, but less GPU which for gaming actually means it's not quite as good and importantly, I believe the Aya Neo is a little bit easier to get your hands on right? - Yeah and like, realistically, this is like almost I wouldn't say a laptop replacement cause that's not quite. - Its like USBC, you kind of could. - Like you can dock this and have this be your computer that you travel around with. It has a lot more versatility than the Steam Deck. - The problem and this is really nothing to do with us as consumers but more so on the backend. Valve aren't making money on Steam Decks, right? Like they're making those so you buy more games on Steam. Aya Neo is a company who actually needs to make money on the hardware that they sell, right? So obviously they've gotta build in some profit there and of course you're also paying for a full copy of Windows and all kinds of other stuff. So look, this is a niche item. I think it's a little bit nicer than the Steam Deck in certain ways and the fact that if you want something that's gonna really properly run Windows right out the box, it's a good option. But I think the vast majority of people are better off serve waiting for the Steam Deck or purchasing one of the other items we have here such as the Analog Pocket. Now, similar to the Playdate this is more of a retro inspired console. It's really designed to play Game Boy games. Now, yes, Game Boys have existed for many a year. The thing is what you get with this is something that is not emulating. It's actually well FPG - It's hardware emulating. - Yes, exactly. - It's not software emulating. - It also has a terrific screen, an incredibly high resolution 1600 by 1440 display, 10 X on both resolutions compared to an original Game Boy game. The display on the Analog Pocket is absolutely 100% my favorite part of this device. - Yeah, it's an amazing display. - Crazy. - However, I know you're gonna defend this. - [Austin] Yeah. - And I know you're gonna say like, oh yeah, it up scales it and blah, blah, blah. - Yeah. - But at the end of the day, it is still one of the best screens I've seen pushing 12 pixels. - No, but here's the thing, right? So Game Boy advanced games actually don't look quite as nice because it's not the same aspect ratio. - [Matt] Yeah. - Because this display is literally 10 times the vertical and horizontal resolution of an original Game Boy, it means that if you put one of those games in there it is absolutely unreal at how well it not only draws all the pixels but get all the lines between pixels and stuff. The stuff that you cannot really get even on like a super higher end emulator. On top of that the hardware feels really nice. So it is plastic, but it has very nice buttons and importantly it actually works with all the original accessories. I've got a full link cable port here. I can trade and play with other people either with an Analog Pocket or an original Game Boy and on top of that the screen and the speakers and the headphones check like the whole thing is basically just a super, super nice Game Boy. This thing is awesome. I love it. - [Matt] But I mean like let's go back to price. - [Austin] Yeah. - [Matt] It's $220 - [Austin] Which if you're trying to build a custom Game Boy you're gonna end up spending something that's actually not too far away from that by the time you have to like swap out the shell, buy the new screen, you have to solder things. Again that's stuff that we've done before in the past but what you're gonna get is even if you heavily modify an original Game Boy, it's gonna be very difficult for you to get something which is going to be this solid feeling and you also have some emulator like features. Like I can just put this to sleep. - Yeah. - And then just wake it up. - That's nice. - It's a safe states, but it's cool. - You know, if it had like a built-in emulator where you didn't have to use cartridges, I think that would go a long way. - So here's the thing. - And there's yeah. - That would be a potential thing that it might be able to do at some point maybe. (clears throat) - But it doesn't right now when it costs $220. - Yeah. - And that's kind of my point with it. Like if I go get an emulator machine like this one I could play every game. The Anbernic RG552. These little handhelds have always been pretty good, the little emulator machines but this is the first one that really kicks it up a notch. If you saw our every day carry video which you can catch up here. This here is been in my bag since I got this, this is one of my favorite devices of quite a while. These have all run like some version of custom firmware that was kind of like RetroArc. But like the processors on them were pretty low. They were able to do like up to like PlayStation one, but like barely. This is the first time it's been a major upgrade. What actually caught my eye about this particular one is this the first time that out of the box runs Android. So spec wise, this is a six core 1.8 Gigahertz RK3399 processor. This can run up to Wii games. It ran Mario galaxy just fine. - Wow, that's impressive. - It runs PSP just fine. So I was playing Liberty city stories on that. - That's actually pretty impressive. - Yeah. - How much is this? - [Matt] So this is $250. - That's a lot for 250 bucks. - Here's the hidden thing that I loved about this. I got this running with Xbox game pass. Out of the box, it runs Android 7. Someone had gotten Android 11 up and running on it but unfortunately it's not officially supported. I tried that. I was not able to get that to work. - No, this also can run Linux right? - Yes. - If you wanna flash a copy. - And it has two ports, two micro SD card slots on there. So you can actually dual booth this, if you wanted to. - That's cool. - Where it gets kind of sketchy is internally it only has a 2.4 Gigahertz wifi card. - Oh, you can't. Yeah. That's not great. - So while I was able to get xCloud running on this it wasn't a great experience. Just out of the box, it doesn't actually support 5 gigahertz. - Drivers. Yeah. - So if you were to upgrade it to Android 11 which I was unable to do, you could get this up and running. There's some other weird downsides to this. It does not have Bluetooth in any way, shape or form. - That's a miss. A big miss. - A big miss. - Yeah. - Especially because it has a mini HDMI port outta here. So you can plug it into your TV. However, if it doesn't have Bluetooth you're not really gonna wanna dock this. - It's a little smaller than a switch light, but it's kind of in that same sort of zone. That's not looking too promising. Did you forget to charge your Anbernic? - No, I let these charge overnight. - Did your Anbernic die right before we made a video on it? - Unfortunately, my Anbernic actually died. - Is it actually dead? - It's not turning on - This thing is really cool if it wasn't just spontaneously dead right before we hit the record button. I will absolutely give you that there's a very interesting use case for this Anbernic. If you're looking for a small emulator, this makes a lot of sense. - So it brings us around to the prices of all these things and having seen the pros and cons of everything I think you should just wait for a Steam Deck. - Wait, did you click bait me, Matt? You made me sit through this entire video and now you're telling me that I was right to wait for my Steam Deck all along. - Yeah. So as much as I like all of these, let's be real no one's cross shopping a Steam Deck with a Playdate. These two are within the ballpark of a Steam Deck. The versatility that you get with the Steam Deck I think outweighs the price difference between these. - This is one of those things where it's very much dependent on you, the gamer. - Yeah. - If you want like the super authentic Game Boy style experience, this is obviously your move. If you want the quirky weird Playdate, that's your move. If you want just emulators with none of the extra stuff, that actually is gonna work well when it actually wants to turn on the Anbernic makes sense. - To turn back on cause I love this thing. I'm so sad. (Matt crying) - If you'd like send condolences to Matt for his loss, feel free to tweet him @matt_ansini. - Let us know in the comments what other handhelds you think we should have taken a look at. Type F in the chat for me and send me $12 so I can buy a new one. If you each send me $12, I can buy a couple of these. My Cash App can be written #44264 Klondike the letter H in Latin.

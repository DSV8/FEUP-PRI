And by knowing how they function, what can I take advantage of?  Well, headphones are really quite simple.  A few basic physics lessons will help you master headphone diaphragms and drivers in a jiffy!  Other videos in the \"All About Headphones\" series: Introduction to All About Headphones -  #1 How do headphones really work? -  #2 Open-back vs Closed-back headphones? -  #3 Are frequency range and spectrum graphs important? -  #4 What is headphone impedance? -  #5 What is the perfect pair of headphones? -",

    "transcript": "Why is it important for me to know why headphones work? Well mostly because it's interesting about the pussy But also because by knowing how they work and what designs exist you'll be more capable of narrowing down that perfect pair If you already know how speakers work congrats headphones are designed near identically if you don't know fear not little one It's remarkably simple engineering if you crack open the enclosure of just about any headphone You'll find similarly designed components across the board Inside the headphone enclosure is this little guy. It's called the driver assembly, and this is where all the magic happens Now the part that produces sound is this dude. It's called the diaphragm on speakers It's more commonly known as a cone now The diaphragm is vibrated or more correctly pulled back and forth at Rapid succession Which pushes on the air surrounding the headphones now as you may remember from Junior High school science class? disruptions and displacements in air creates sound waves now sound waves are receptive by our ears and Interpreted or percepted by our brains if you lost me there don't worry to oversimplify things this diaphragm Which is usually made out of plastic and headphones? produces the sound or music when it vibrates You might be thinking, but how does the diaphragm move there's no motor on there? Now if we remove the diaphragm from the assembly we'll find two crucial parts that I'm going to explain Now some headphones and speakers have other parts such as a spider or a pole piece yada yada I'm not going to explain those things if you want to know more I put a link to discovery channel's how it's made in the description that well explains all the parts to a driver so the two parts of great importance are these First we have a magnet now the type [of] magnet and the strength vary depending on the headphone Model And that's not a really great importance Secondly we have what's called a voice coil. It's usually a threaded copper wire. That's it he's to the diaphragm now when you play music through your headphones say through your iphone you are outputting a certain amount of Through the cable so yes from your headphone jack [all] the way to your ears through the cable is running electricity back and forth now that current goes directly into this concentrated voice coil and as a result it creates an Electromagnetic field now I don't know if [you] remember from High school physics class But electromagnetic fields are cool because they're only polarized [for] charge when electricity runs through them So a varying current of the audio signal Causes the voice coil to move up and down Alongside or rather inside the magnetic housing and since it's attached to the diaphragm it pulls the diaphragm back and forth The diaphragm pushes the Air back and forth and that creates sound waves which is how we hear Cool beans, that's all there is to it so now you can go brag to all the cute girls in your contact list that you know the ins and outs of drivers and diaphragms Actually, don't do that This video is a series and consists of several different parts Select the video that you'd like to watch and click on the corresponding annotation if you're on a mobile device You'll be unable to click the annotations and thus the links to the other videos are provided in the video description below",

    "transcript": "now you know it's going to be a good time when the trash bag packaging comes out [Music] now the thing that makes this urine motherboard from AliExpress more exciting than a normal motherboard is that it has a laptop CPU soldered straight to the board making it a lot less flexible and on the back it shows some pictures of the heat spreader that covers the laptop die out of modesty presumably now I can't quite remember which of these CPU options I ended up buying so I guess we'll find that out together later on let's open it up [Music] oh it comes with a very straight cut note with some useful advice on it and then we also get a SATA cable with a little bit of thermal paste it's a nice addition now the first thing that I noticed is that it didn't come with the CMOS battery that's a bit weird I guess I'll just have to steal one from another motherboard now aside from the abducted CMOS battery the most exciting part of this motherboard is the Slither of copper in the middle it's cool that they pre-install the heat spreader for you although around the back they did use some hipster triangle head screws for some reason either way it's cool that you don't have to worry about damaging the die and I'm sure that it also helps with like cooler mounting clearance and stuff next up according to the sticker we've got an early 11th core i7 in here which I'm assuming is the 11800h a laptop chip that's relatively recent and very powerful so we should be able to get some gaming out of this chip that won't make our eyes bleed even with its eye GPU but we'll find out soon enough in terms of rear i o we've got a bunch of video out which should help for igpu gaming other than that though it's not looking fancy back here but it should get the job done in terms of the power delivery it looks like the kind of thing used by the ancient Sumerians to power their cattle but it's a pretty low power draw laptop chip so it should be fine next to that I'm really excited by the fact that despite it being a laptop chip we have full size desktop Ram slots so we don't have to use any loser laptop Ram generally in terms of features the motherboard is perfectly fine we've got two m.2 slots a Wi-Fi card slot and we even get some front USB 3. very nice anyway with that let's build our system and see how she runs some games [Music] a LGA 1200 mounting fits on it that's good to know oh let me quickly go steal a CMOS battery somewhere and then we'll finish the cooler mounting [Music] hey hurrying it works now in terms of CPU apparently it's a genuine Intel cpu000 at 2.2 gigahertz which is very convincing I guess it's because it's an engineering sample that it doesn't have its normal name up uh in terms of memory oh okay well it's just running at its base frequency but we'll check out the files in a second and see if we can do anything about that it just says Intel UHD Graphics that's that's very useful was an intimidatingly retro throwback with Pages upon pages of settings all written in what I can only imagine to be a language long lost to the annals of history and after a confusing 20 minutes of drowning in sub menus I concluded there was nothing I could do about the memory speeds foreign we're starting off with GTA 5 using 1080p normal settings because we've got an igp wow this actually isn't running too poorly now it may just be sitting in the 30s but we're running at the native resolution of this display and it's not triggering my botulism what's also very promising about this is we're only getting about 11-ish percent CPU utilization so later on when we throw in a proper graphics card we may get some serious gaming performance also look at that power drone [Music] now with cs go running in competitive settings we have some jarring stutters but in the moments of clarity between the stutters despite the non-show-stopping frame rate the game feels pretty good often with frame rates this low you can get a lot of input lag in CS go and while there's a little bit of it here it's not that bad ah there we go like I'm still able to put these bots in their place [Music] okay now hear me out Battlefield 5 may be running like an asthmatic in a pollen Factory here but we're using a genuine Intel igpu and there's some Battlefield 5 happening so I just can't help but be impressed here dropping the resolution to 720p yields a significant performance Improvement and it doesn't look that bad Battlefield 5 wears 720p better than I was expecting the most exciting thing for me though is that CPU utilization there's a lot of room to grow now I'm going to be a complete badass and start off Half-Life 2 with all high settings I know I know it's Madness but let's see what happens nice my bravery paid off look at that hundreds of frames anyway let's drop it on reasonably powerful graphics card in here to really make the CPU wheeze [Music] that is running a little bit better and I've even cranked the advanced settings to keep us from the starter zone so this is Peak GTA 5 without mods and stuff and whatever but yeah it's running a bit better and the system looks great the motherboard kind of reminds me of one of those little fish that clean the mouths of whale sharks it's pretty wholesome with Battlefield 5 a 1080p ultra settings it's running interestingly we're getting quite wild fluctuations in frame rate and we've clearly got a CPU bottleneck going on here with quite low GPU utilization what's pretty crazy about all this for me is that this is ultra settings and we're getting 150 frames per second but the graphics cards only being used like 50 percent it's like oh look at this CPU bottleneck we're only getting 170 frames per second what an outrage to be fair when things get busier the frame it does drop tip only about a hundred with cyberpunk at 1080p ultra settings we're seeing a similar Trend to Battlefield 5 where the CPU is worth about half the power of the RTX 4070 TI that we're using it is holding the GPU back but it's a very powerful GPU and it's doing an admirable job in my opinion I think there's just one thing left to do I want to remove that cold plate so we can get some bareback action between the CPU Cooler and the Silicon die to see what that does for our temperatures [Music] very careful about evenly relieving pressure here because I don't want to accidentally murder a CPU die oh I think it just fell there is our contact plate and as you can see they just use a thermal paste application that makes contact with the laptop die down there now seeing the height of this plate I'm actually not sure we're going to be able to normally Mount that cooler I don't think it's going to touch the die but we'll give it a try in a second and in that Obelisk is our 11th gen laptop CPU which is so tiny let's give it a clean and have a closer look [Music] and that shiny bit of silicon with the gold letters next to it is our genuine Intel CPU foreign wow that's not even almost touching I guess we're gonna have to get a bit more ratchet with it a few moments later so I guess now we're gonna have to Mega raw Target because we don't even have mounting hardware for the CPU Cooler what I'm gonna do is just kind of gently place the cooler down that feels reasonable let's turn it on and see what happens wow okay so all you need to do to knock a couple of degrees off of your genuine Intel CPU is remove the contact plate and then precariously lean your cooler on it it sounds like useful information to end the video on [Music] thank you",

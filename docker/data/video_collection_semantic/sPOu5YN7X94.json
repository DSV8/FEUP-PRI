    "transcript": "- Today on This Is, we are purchasing some of the worst items I have ever seen from Sharper Image. - Like a billion dollar flash drive. - I hate it all. Sharper Image was the cool, futuristic tech store, that had all kinds of gadgets and gizmos from the year 2000. - Yeah, it was the future that the 80's promised us, and then it just lived in your mall next to the Hot Topic. I'll tell you, smartphones killed Sharper Image. Because, all these gadgets, were just things that are in smartphones. - I think Wish.com killed Sharper Image. - I like that you bring up Wish.com, because our consensus here was that Sharper Image, which now lives exclusively online, is just Wish.com for rich people. Everything here is extremely expensive. We got a handful of stuff here for you. - Got it. - And we also found equivalence of these items, across the internet. At like Amazon, Wish, stuff like that. - Oh. - And what we wanna do is, I wanna show you a couple products, and I'm gonna tell you how much we paid on Sharper Image. You can fire me. And then, I want you to try and guess where we found it. - Great, time to subscribe to This Is, because it's finally time to fire Matt. And I'll just do this video solo. - Yeah. - I'll talk into both mics. - First one. - Password Safe. - I know that you're a big fan of using one pass. So, here we have a password vault. - Securely remember all your passwords. Protect your identity. I'll say, just first impressions, this feels like it's 19.99 As Seen on TV. It does come with triple A batteries included. - This is the first time we've been prepared, and I actually brought batteries. - And it actually came with them. - And it actually came with them. - You know, what? Sharper Image, worth it. - Let's activate. Okay, what's my master pin? This Is. Okay, I'm gonna add a password. - So, I wanna read the description for this. - [Austin] Oh, god. This is annoying. - The safest passwords are also the hardest ones to remember, but the Password Vault makes it easy. Password Vault fits in any desk drawer, glove box, or purse, and is not connected to the internet. So it can not be easily hacked. - So, now that I have successfully saved, I'm gonna hit okay. Notes, don't forget. (Matt laughs) Man, this ain't it. This ain't it. - First of all, how much do you think we paid for this? - This should cost 19.99, $20 tops. But, I think you paid $50 on Sharper Image. Final answer. - [Matt] It was $70 on Sharper Image. - Oh. - We found the exact same thing on Amazon for $50 I believe. - What is wrong with boomers these days? If you can use this, you can use something like One Pass, or whatever. - Did you make your password butts? - You just realized that? - (laughs) So, you're O for one on these products. - Yeah, this is terrible I hate it. - All right, this next one here, the only reason I bought this one, is because it's the cheapest product on Sharper Image. (Austin laughing) - The personal air purifier. Oh, god this is so dumb. I hate this. Why? Oh my god, it's dumber than I thought, Matt. It's an air purifier that goes around your neck, that somehow is purifying the air around you? It eliminates 99% of viruses in 20 minutes. How? - The TSA approved, high performance personal air purifier, uses electrostatic purification to create a three foot zone of cleaner air around you. - Oh, good lord. - No, it's backwards. If it's backwards like that, you're drawing the ions in. - (laughs) Oh, no! There's too many ions in my nose. - There's a three foot section here, where you're just full of disease now. There's a light. It's blinking. - That's it? There's zero chance, that if I'm in an airport or something, that this is doing anything besides making this little bit actually clean. - What do you think that we paid for the purifier? - You said this was the cheapest product on Sharper Image? I think you should spend $0 on this, because it's stupid and lame. I'm gonna say that the legit price of this, like if you were buying it outside of Sharper Image, I'm gonna say again, 20 bucks. I think, 20 bucks is about reasonable. I think because you're buying it from Sharper Image, I'm gonna be conservative and say it's $30, if this is the cheapest item you can get on Sharper Image. - You are closer than you were on the vault. So, it was $40 on Sharper Image. - That's the cheapest item they sell? - Cheapest item, besides an electric can opener. We found it on Amazon for $18. - Ah, I was pretty close then. - What is this? What did we find? - There's a warranty card. Hey, you're so stupid. You bought this thing. Give us you're information, we'll sell you more stupid things. - Ah, there it is. It wouldn't be a video without Austin sniffing the product. - You know, what? It actually might be. Like, that actually does smell like an air purifier. - All right, I gotta go get you the next product. I'll be right back. - Those are golf clubs, Matt. Why do I need golf clubs? - So, the next item up we have, is the Driver Drink Dispenser. - (laughs) So you can just get wasted while you're golfing, and driving the golf cart around? Oh, good lord. Okay. - So, this guy here. - (laughs) Hey, it says... - Is a drink dispenser that goes in your golf club. So, this might be my favorite product ever. What you do here, is you gotta little drink here. Go ahead, there's a little tab here. Go ahead, why don't you pour yourself a drink? Give it a squirt. - What? This is... - It's making some noises. - Oh! Oh! - That is an aggressive squirt. - I'd like to thank YouTube for not demonetizing us for this video. - All right, so there you go. We have washed it first, don't worry. - Wow, it tastes like a drink that came out of a golf club. - So, the Drink Driver Disp... (Austin laughing) - Is that just a way to not get kicked off the course for drinking and driving your golf cart? - Yes. - Okay, love that. - And the 48 ounces is enough to keep any thirsty foursome well quenched. - Run that back one more time. Thirsty foursome? - Yes. The thirsty foursome is a new band name. I'm calling it. - (laughs) Why four? - So, do you not know? I had to explain this to Kenzie and Aaron. - [Austin] Yeah. - In golf, it's a twosome, it's a threesome, it's a foursome. - Oh, oh. Nevermind. - Yeah, that's actually like a golf thing. So, while it's funny to be like (laughs) foursome. That is exactly what it is. (laughs) - Now, you said that way too excited. - You're voice went up an octave. - Anyway, what do you think we paid for... - Oh, no. This is big. So, I find that usually on scammy, slash overpriced websites, they charge you based on how big it is. So if it's a bigger product, it's worth more money, because it's bigger, and cooler. So, I'm gonna say it should cost 79.95. That's what it actually should run. But, I think it actually costs $160. - Okay! Okay. So, this was $70 on Sharper Image. We found one on Amazon, which when we looked it was $50 for the Big Beertha. - You know what? Sharper Image actually gets the W on this one. - I'm giving Sharper Image the W on this one. - Tentative thumbs up. This is actually not bad, and kind of cool. Mostly, a way to hide your drinking problem. Which you should probably seek help for, but other than that it seems fine. - Speaking of drinking problems. We sometimes like to party when we're out on the links. What we got here is... - Is that his Bluetooth speaker? - Yes. (laughs) - What's with all the weird golf stuff? - Again, most of Sharper Image is golf stuff. - Wait, at what point do you actually take irons, and clubs and stuff with you? I feel like this is gonna take up the whole bag. - And it's a lot heavier than I thought it was gonna be. This is the Bluetooth Golf Speaker. It's just, that's what they call it. So, my favorite part about it, is when we turn it on. - Sound caddy. - Wait for it to connect. (golf ball bouncing) They got the little golf noises when you turn it on and off, and it connects. - All right, actually kind of cool. (laughs) - I kept the box for this one. - What's the Sharper Image return policy? - (laughs) None. So, apparently they've thought of everything. - Apparently so. - And have included a pin, here. So, if you want to, you could put this into the ground. - Look man, this is all some rich white people (beep). So, I don't know. - So, how much do you think we paid for the sound caddy? - I think this should cost $30, because it's a stupid Bluetooth speaker. I think it actually cost $139. - So, we spent 100 on it. - [Austin] Okay. - And the cheapest equivalent one we found was $60. So, 40%. - I'm overestimating things. - Yeah, you are. But, I did not spend $5,000, on an arcade cabinet. - Oh, yeah. - Or... There was a... - $5,000 for... - There was like a bean bag chair, that had a massager in it, that was like 35 hundred. - How would it work? You'd be like. - Do you feel like you're ready for a day outside? You got your drinks. You got your tunes. You got your purifier. You don't have to worry about. - I forgot my butts password. - Yeah. So, the next one we have. - [Austin] Virtual Pong. - I don't even know if we're gonna be able to show this in. - We're not. This is, uh, Matt. - Again, I only wanted to show this one, because I like the video that was on. - Okay, let me see the video. Let me see the video. (upbeat music) Well it's ages six and up. So, unfortunately we're not qualified for this. This is dumb. - I have something I think is good. - Okay. - This might be good. - Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Okay, I'm ready. Let's go. This says it is a QKY-AIR. It's a black speaker. Top golf is a thing. The Air by QKY. Oh, I was actually right. Okay. Expand your sound. Oh my god. Is it a five in one Bluetooth speaker, where you get to snap apart all the pieces? - That is correct. - So, you put them together as combined stereo sound. Individually portable. Multi-room surround sound. - It looks cool. - Yeah. So, basically all the individual speakers, they detach. Although, apparently you're not suppose to do this while it's on. - I will say it's satisfying. That's a satisfying click to it. - Yeah, it all works together, so you fire them all up together. Although, one LED doesn't work but, whatever. So, do you want to? - I'm gonna take my side here. - [Austin] Okay. - One goes back there. Surround sound. (funky music playing) So, this one is cutting out. It doesn't sound horrible. - First of all, they're not in sync correctly. They sound like they're all... - They're outta phase. It's like the number one thing. It's like the biggest problem you can have for a wireless surround sound. - Do do do, do do do. It actually doesn't sound bad though. Honestly, you do get a little bit of that surround sound, just because you're surrounded by speakers. You can even hear when they're all together, that they're phasing in and out. - Yeah, they're not well synced. - How much was this? - So, this was the most expensive thing we bought today. At $250 on Sharper Image. - Excuse me for a second while I just. $250! - Look, enjoy your favorite music in multiple rooms. - No, I don't think it's gonna. It doesn't even work in one room, much less multiple rooms. - Okay. So, this ones trash. It was trash. I'll admit it was trash. It looked cool. It seemed like it was priced accordingly. Because we couldn't find another product like this, other than Sonos. - Oh yeah, Sonos. But Sonos are actually gonna work. - We did find one that was $200. And it had very poor reviews. - This also should have very poor reviews. This is dumb. - I have one more item for you. - Okay, hit me. - All right. So, I have two things here. - Okay. These are very small. It says one gigabyte, and it is a wooden flash drive. - How much do you think I paid for that? - For a one gigabyte USB two flash drive? About nothing, because you can get them for free at Micro Center, and they're like 32 times the size. The fact that you're laughing so much. - This product might be the most egregious product. - $5 might be about the max I would wanna spend on this. - Okay, I paid $5 for that on Amazon. And the reason I bring that one up first, is because of how egregious this next product is. - Okay. - From Sharper Image, okay? - Hit me. Billion Dollar Art Gallery. Two hour video includes titles and original music. Five hundred of history's most beautiful paintings. Wait, what? - Austin, what do you think is on the Billion Dollar Art Gallery flash drive? - It's a stupid flash drive with a bunch of jpeg's and video of stuff that they got off of Wikipedia. (Matt laughing) It's a wood box. You open it up and it is a metal flash drive. I mean this seems fancy and expensive, but I can tell you, that this should cost no more than $5 tops. - $5 for a one gigabyte flash drive? Here's the beautiful thing, we don't even need this flash drive. Because this is built into the TV. The TV already has this. You could do this with literally any flash drive. All of these images are public domain. What do you think that we paid for the Billion Dollar Art Gallery? Do you think we paid a billion dollars? - I think you got it for less than a billion dollars, which instantly makes it a good deal. I wanna see one of these videos first. - All right. - A lot of photos. Okay, we're gonna play the video. - I guarantee this is just gonna be a slideshow with clips of music on it. - It's the video. It's a two hour video with some music. - How much do you think that we paid for the Billion Dollar Art Gallery? I promise you it's not a billion dollars. I feel like you would've gotten notified by the credit card company. - For the Billion Dollar Art Gallery? Because you're hyping this up so much, I will say you spent $80 on this. - [Matt] That is exactly what we spent. - [Austin] Is it really? - 79.99 but, they did send us a $25 gift card. (laughs) So. - Great. I feel great. You know how people keep saying tax the rich? Just tax the stupid. (laughs) - This here, I was flabbergasted when I went through all this stuff, at how expensive these things are. - Yeah. - This is a scam. I know we talk about scams a lot with our videos. This is a scam. - I have nothing to say. I would implore you to not purchase any of these items, and use this video for what it is. A piece of hard-hitting consumer journalism, and not a desperate ploy to put scam in the title of a YouTube video to get those sweet, sweet clicks. Thanks you very much for watching, subscribe, and I think all of this just belongs to, go the garbage way of things.",

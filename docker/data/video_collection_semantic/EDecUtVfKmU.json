    "description": "Before my One Plus 5T review, here are my impressions of it. OnePlus upgraded their best android phone with a larger screen, new camera and updated security features.  Colorful Notebooks -   OnePlus is looking to join the large screen to body ratio market with their new OnePlus 5T. OnePlus decided to shake things up a little and changed their cameras to a 16 MP main camera and a 20 MP secondary for enhanced low-light photography. Unlocking your phone will be super fast with their fingerprint sensor and face unlock. The OnePlus 5T is one of the best phones for its price range competing against the S8, LG V30, Essential PH-1, Pixel 2 XL and the iPhone X.

    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here So the OnePlus 5T was just announced, and I thought I'd just do a quick impressions video of this thing, so I've been using it for a few days This won't be a full review obviously But I want to share some of my thoughts of this device with you guys So the first thing, the big thing about this phone Is the screen. It's been updated to an 18 by 9 ratio. It's a much larger screen It's just over six inches and the screen-to-body ratio is just over 80% right now, so it looks a lot more I guess modern over the original OnePlus 5, not that the OnePlus 5 looked poor But because of 2017's whole like, bezel-less smartphone influx This just looks more up-to-date. In terms of the actual screen itself like how useful we find it, it depends on how you use your phone for and how you like your screen Personally, I don't love 18 by 9 screen ratios. I find them a little bit weird to me I like my 16 by 9. Maybe I'm old school. I like my screen 16 by 9 like my laptop 16 by 9 I like my phone 16 by 9, but you might like this. This is the thing for 2017 Okay, what else has changed? The other big one is the fingerprint sensor, so this has been moved to the back now And I've always been a big fan of fingerprint sensors in the back. I've always found it Just easier to hold, you pull out of your pocket, fingers already there When you have that fingerprint sensor on the front, like the original OnePlus 5 down at the bottom Especially because this phone is like, so sleek It's just the top heavy device, and not that you drop it or anything But just, I don't like it as much as a back placement I've always liked it there, and it's nice that they have it there. Now I know some people don't like the fingerprint sensor on the back because if your phone's on the table You can't unlock it unless you pick it up, but they actually have a face unlock this year Which doesn't really resolve the first thing But I thought it'd be a good segue to talk about face unlock. Um, I got to be honest I thought face unlock would be bad I thought it would just be a really kind of like me-too product that OnePlus would put on their phone But I am amazed by how good it is. Now I haven't been able to test it thoroughly in terms of like how secure it actually it is But it is fast. Like significantly faster than Apple's Face ID which is weird but at the same time kind of expected, because this thing doesn't have the nearly like the security in terms of like how many facial points is measuring. It's very very fast It's pretty much instant. The moment you look at your phone, the face unlocks so, which leads me to believe that it probably has some kind of flaws to it, but if you use it as kind of like a secondary security device I think it's not bad, but I do want to test this thing out more thoroughly over time. The other thing that's changed is the camera. So the OnePlus 5 virtually launched with a telephoto lens. This is now no longer a telephoto lens It's the same kind of focal length, but this lens is actually supposed to help with low-light photography. Now I don't miss the lack of telephoto lens at all because I never use that stuff, but I do wish it was a wide-angle Unfortunately, it's not I am interested to see how this thing performs in low-light because this thing was never bad like the OnePlus 5 was never really bad at low light so I don't know... This might seem promising I will be covering that in my full review later on The thing that hasn't changed which I thought was surprising was the battery, so it's still a 3300 milliamp hour battery, which... I don't know. I don't know how I feel about that I mean it's the same chassis size, but because the screen is larger And it's like the same brightness as the OnePlus 5. I'm assuming this somehow It draws more power than the original screen So, wouldn't the battery life be reduced? Maybe? I'm not sure. Now, Dash Charge... These devices, if they are still in the frame I mean, this is one of the best things about the OnePlus 5 system I think it's about 30 minutes for a 60 percent charge You can't go wrong with that. Now, overall the phone hasn't changed all that much It's not like massive upgrades or anything It's a nice refresh. Same processor, same battery just a little bit better all around Now the best part about it all, but the price hasn't changed. This thing launches at $500 Which is the same price as original OnePLus 5 I think goes for sale on November 21st, so yeah. If you want to check it out, I'll leave a link below Hope you guys enjoyed this video! Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it. See you guys next time! Oh yeah, if you're wondering what these are, these are the cases And it didn't open them because I'm not much of a case person. I don't love the red I also don't love the wood which is two of the cases. The carbon fiber looks pretty cool It's just not something I would rock on my phone personally But the sandstone, which is like the original OnePlus kind of texture, I like that, but I'm just not a big fan of cases.",

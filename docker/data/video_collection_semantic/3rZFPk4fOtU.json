    "transcript": "- [Austin] Is the Xbox 360, the Wii and the PS3 actually usable in 2022? - Can you? - I don't know. We're about to find out. - Cool. - Good question. (console whirring) - [Jared] Ugh. - Sounds lovely. - It's loud. I don't remember it being that loud. That is like a copy machine. What? - Xbox 360! - So one of my memories from this, if you rotated the console while it was still spinning it would hella scratch the disc and you would basically ruin all your games. So don't do that. - Step one. Does it connect to Xbox Live? Well, I mean, yes, 'cause I'm logged in. I mean, I was able to immediately log into Xbox Live. - It's kind of amazing that Microsoft's UI design actually is dated pretty well. - [Jared] Are you serious? I hate the Xbox interface. - This looks totally fine. - As someone who never used an Xbox 360 ever growing up, I picked up the controller earlier, tried to set this up, and getting through the interface was a nightmare. I hate using it. It's annoying to use. - The \"Bluecoats: North vs South.\" - Oh my God. - That hasn't aged well. Wow. What? What? Obviously, no games are coming out on Xbox 360 today, but there are some games that are, like, relatively new. - Can you buy it though? - [Jared] Isn't that game from like 2016? - Yeah. So shows $10. Save to hard drive. - Let's just do it. Just buy it, screw it. - We gotta make sure if it works. Wait, let's see if it actually goes through. - [Jared] Austin, careful, you're gonna crash the server. - Wait, oh, hey! We're launching into \"Goat Simulator\" right now. How do I play? Why did I just buy? Why do I have a jet pack on? What? - [Jared] This escalated so fast. - [Kenneth] Dude, if you've never played this game- - [Joanna] It like literally escalated. - Oh, you can rag doll it? So I mean, obviously it doesn't look amazing, right? So most all 360 games are gonna be running at like 720p ish. What else can we do on this? - Netflix. Netflix was a huge part of the 360. Let's try Netflix. So fun thing about Netflix on the 360 was they did end up taking away this feature, but it did have one of the first instances of Party Mode. - Yes! You had all your avatars or whatever you call the- - Yeah, your Xbox gamer avatars or whatever. You would just sit with your friends in a virtual theater and watch Netflix with your friends. That's how I watched anime before I knew what anime was. - Oh! - This console gets support, so I mean, why not, right? - Yo. See, is this the best console to buy in 2022? Maybe. - No, look, look. - Bro, this just works. - Favorite anime of all time? - Why do I let Ken log into his Netflix? - Fine, we'll watch \"Forrest Gump.\" - [Jared] It could be a black screen on the recorder. - [Kenneth] Oh my god, it is playing. - This video is sponsored by Mine. Have you ever wondered just how many companies you've given your personal info to over the years? 50, 100, 3,000? - All right, I get it! - Well, on average most people have unknowingly given their data to over 350 companies and they could still have that data right now. Think about it. All of your sensitive personal data, address, phone number, credit card, everything could just be sitting on a growing number of servers, each one leading to a bigger and bigger risk of a data breach. That is where Mine comes in. With Mine, you can reclaim the data that belongs to you. It's as easy as signing up with the email that you want to check. Mine will then run a scan of your email and tell you what companies have your data. And I have almost 700,000. I'll tell you, I haven't used some of these companies in years and I'm sure you'll find a lot that you've completely forgotten about. Mine will show you the risk level of each company, as well as how often you use them. Mine has also created a state-of-the-art solution for companies to help manage the privacy operations better for the benefit of both companies and consumers. So now I can make cautious decisions to minimize my digital risk and online exposure. Luckily, all I need to do now is click reclaim and Mine will use my email to send that company a letter to delete all of my personal data. But it doesn't mean that you have to cut connections from your favorite brand. You can just mark them as a business that you still need. And if you make a mistake, there's no need to worry. You can undo a reclaim within the first hour. So what are you waiting for? Reclaim your data today at saymine.com. And thank you to Mine for sponsoring this video. - [Joanna] All right guys, here's the superior console. - I mean, there's a real argument for that. You think the PS5 and the Xbox Series X are bad? This had lines out and around the door for I wanna say at least two, if not three years, every Christmas time. Like, people wanted the Wii. - I only got one within like the first few months of it coming out because my dad had a friend who had a connection at Nintendo- - [Kenneth] Your uncle worked at Nintendo? - You're the guy! You're the kid I hated in school! Jared, shut up. Joanna, talk to him. - [Joanna] Shut up, Jared. - [Kenneth] Yeah, Jared. Can we please try the 360 out? - [Joanna] Jared's busy. - Hold on. Everyone calm down. We're not safe yet. Now we're safe. Welcome to the Wii. First thing I'll notice, 480p look bad. Like, this does not look good on a modern TV at all. - Yeah, it's very hard to read. - Wait guys, we have a message. We got a message. - From Nintendo. - Wii to Wii U Transfer. Oh wow. They're already checking out. They're like, hey, idiot- - Wait, can you click on the link? Does that work? - Let's go to the internet channel. Wait, is this on wifi right now? - [Jared] Yep. - [Joanna] The internet. Oh my gosh. The internet. - [Austin] It's preparing. Oh, I have to download it. Yeah, sure. Come on, do something. Do something! - [Joanna] I've been looking forward to this for so long. You don't even- - Joanna had a Wii growing up and was never able to get online because she didn't have internet. You've never seen the full glory of the Wii. - [Joanna] I haven't. Oh, ah! - [Kenneth] Wait. Oh, okay. - [Austin] Wait! (bright music) - Okay, the server exists, but it doesn't have anything. - [Joanna] Well, that was a bit of a let down, but at least we get the music, right? - [Kenneth] Oh, we have to download these too? - [Austin] Oh, no, they're not gonna work. - Try it, try it, try it. Please tell me it works. 'Cause it's here. - [Kenneth] No, we have to download it. - Try it, try it, try it, try it, try it. - [Kenneth] No, 'cause it's not on our console. - Try it! - [Kenneth] It's not on our console. - I wanna watch YouTube in 480p on my Wii! - It's like when you have the laser pointer and your cat follows it. Yeah. Okay, so no, we're gonna back out of that one. - At least they got the banger music. Maybe if we already had YouTube installed on the console, it might still work, but I doubt it. - All right. Let's go make a Mii. - [Jared] What is this? I'm scared. (light upbeat music) - They really did just load up the bangers with this console, not gonna lie. Who are these people? Hold on, wait. - Who are you people?! - Who are these Miis? - [Joanna] They're not yours? - [Kenneth] Jesse, who's Jesse? - [Austin] Is Jesse Jarrett? I don't know. - [Kenneth] That one looks like Austin. - [Jared] Sad. (laughs) Make a new Mii. - [Joanna] Jared's here. - [Austin] Oh, he's full! - [Joanna] Delete him. Delete somebody. - [Jared] Screw you, Jenny. - [Joanna] Drag her to her death. - Woah, that's so grim. This is fun. - [Austin] Let's start from scratch. - Start from scratch? Okay, okay. We should make it look like each other. - We're making each other's Miis? All right, let's do it. Let's do it. - All right. So this one, all the way down. This one, all the way to the left. Oh wait, there we go. No, wait, no. That one. No. Yeah? - [Joanna] No, it's flat. Go with the first one. - That one? Yeah. Let's go with that one. These, there we go. Cool. Look. - [Jared] That's not bad. - That's not bad, right? - [Joanna] Looks pretty spot on to me. - [Kenneth] Okay. Actually, yeah. Oh, he's moving like it. - Why am I so little?! Wait, why am I so little?! Did you make me that short? Just you wait. Just you wait. - [Kenneth] All the way right, man. All the way right. - [Austin] What?! - [Kenneth] Oh no, no, no. Sorry. I meant the other one. - [Jo anna] Yeah, it's pretty close. - Okay. You got the Filipino golden brown. I appreciate it. Thank you. Real reference point. Kentama. - [Jared] I knew it. - [Austin] Nah, that looks more like it. Actually, I think that's more accurate. How do I pick you up again? - [Kenneth] He's adorable. I actually kinda like him. - [Joanna] Don't throw him away. The lonely parade. - It's like the good old days when it was just the two of us in 2016. - Here comes the question. It's time to play Wii Sports. Does anyone remember which way you put the disc in? - Yes, yes. Here, I got you. Ready? Ready? In case you forgot. - I definitely forgot which side was up. Da, da, da - Ken, I challenge you to a three round bowling match. Bowling was the best one. The other ones- - It was my best one. I was really good at it. Who the is that? - Oh, it's like you practiced. Nope. - [Austin] Okay. A little weak. - [Joanna] That was pretty okay. - Let's go! - I'm in trouble now. Well, we're both at spares. This is not over. We still have two more frames. - Oh, Jesus Christ. You know you're supposed to hit all of them, right? Oh, bowl, bowl, bowl! Let's go! - All right, final frame. I gotta stretch. - Nope. Already. Nope. - Oh well, there you go. - [Austin and Kenneth] Oh! - All right. All right. - [Joanna] It was good, but not good enough. - So my final score is 46. Oh no. - A split. Oh God. Oh no. - Just get the two. - [Joanna] No, you can do it. - No you can't. It's impossible. - [Joanna] You hit these ones on the left and then one of them jumps over and hits the one on the right. - [Austin] You're gonna miss all of them. - No, that got air. Well, okay. Fine. Fine. I got air that I was expecting. - What's the score? 48 to 46! All right, Ken barely is the Wii Sports champion. All right. All right. - [Joanna] Hey, throw the ball backwards. - Oh yeah. - No, no, no, no, no. - [Joanna] Throw it backwards. - Am I just gonna... Sorry. I failed too good. I don't know. - [Austin] Well- - [Kenneth] This is it. - [Austin] This is the PlayStation Triple. - I miss the XMB. - It's so good. - It's so straightforward. It's easy to use. They don't make them like they used to anymore. - Honestly, there's nothing wrong with the 360 interface. The Wii was fine, but the PS3 was super sharp, 1080p, looks beautiful even today. First test, you were able to log in with PS Plus and everything, and it works. Also just a note, because the PS3 is dumb and doesn't support HDMI very well, we are not recording this. - Should you wish to buy digital content for your PS3 or PS Vita, you must first add sufficient funds to your PSN wallet via a desktop, mobile device, PS4 or PS5. So you cannot buy things directly on here without credits, but I'm guessing that you can still download stuff that you've already bought. - So, certainly better than the Wii, which just lets you download the Wii U tool. But now as good as the 360, I was able to purchase something on the device. No issues whatsoever. Are you really gonna use the internet browser to watch YouTube? - Why not? Hold on, real quick. If you wanna know why the PS5 wasn't a mass critical success until like the end of a generation when they figured everything, this, they treated it like a computer when it wasn't. File? Address entry. - So the last test, can we game? The most important thing. The reason why you buy a PS3 in 2022. - The only game that you have here is \"The Last of Us.\" - Yeah, the only game for PS3. Yeah, there you go. Look how the blazing fast install speed of the update. Go faster. Go faster! I want my SSD. This is slow. - [Joanna] It's been quite some time. - It works. - It's loading 0.2, 0.5. - If I didn't hit it, it wouldn't have shown up. We're back to zero. - Wait, what? 0.3, 0.5, 0.6. - But the fact that we're only two tenths of the way in is not exactly boding with confidence. I think it was doing its, like, caching shaders or something. - It really took, what, six, seven years for a game like \"The Last of Us,\" or \"Uncharted 2\" or something to show off what the PS3 was capable of, right? - And it's crazy because I remember I bought it at launch and I started playing it and I did not leave my house until I finished it. - \"Last of Us\"? - Yeah, I literally bought it, went home, popped it in. I'm like, wow, this is actually kind of fun. Did not sleep. Played more. Went to sleep, woke up, played more, and I finished it. - How many hours? It's like a 20 hour game at least? - Yeah, I know. - Oh, here we go. Oh no. Do we load in here? - [Kenneth] Wow, this ran way slower and worse than I remember. - Wait, I don't wanna play this part. No! - [Jared] This is the best part of the game. Oh, don't worry Joanna, it gets better. - That was the least graphic thing. Okay. So they're chasing me right now. All right. We can just skip this part. I don't wanna watch this part. This part's sad. - [Jared] Dude, they're saved. Literally nothing could go wrong. - Oh no. The game got paused. So inconvenient, it's the sad part of the game. - Yeah, we couldn't wait a little longer until the- - Oh, hell no. - Denki.store",

    "transcript": "- TCL, the only way for me to know if your product is a good value is for me to know the price and the closest thing I have to a price for the 20 Pro 5G is this article from last month in PCMag where it is apparently $549 or 549 euros, so I guess we're gonna go based on that. One of the big features here today is of course that TCL has deleted the concept of the camera bump. So you can see the entire device is completely flat back, front. I remember it was not that long ago that you had to pay like a $1,000 almost to get a phone that I mean was basically exactly this shape and with these features something like a Galaxy S6 Edge or more accurately the S6 edge+ since I think the 6.67 inch OLED display is closer in size to that one, the screen kinda wraps around the edge of the 2.5D or whatever you wanna call it, curved glass. But I think TCL has actually done a pretty good job of the size of the dead zones here. So you can see the screen actually ends just as the curve kinda starts. So that way, when you're grabbing onto the phone with your meat hooks there's a much slimmer chance of the skin kinda mushing at the edges and accidentally pressing or swiping to another display screen or whatever else the case may be. Unlike that device though, in spite of the lower price the specs are a lot more modern. So it's pretty middling for a modern flagship with a Snapdragon 750G processor, a six gigs of Ram, 256 gigs of storage. But that's also more than most people will need and when I say most people I don't mean tech enthusiasts out there I'm talking like my uncle just got a new phone and he literally uses it as a telephone more than he could ever need, you can quote me on that. You've got your SIM removal tool, you got your (speaking French), quick start guide, there it is in English on the other side, you got your charger brick that supports up to 18 watt fast charging and let's see if they've included... This doesn't look like a fast charger. It'll do 12 volts, one and a half amps. So there's your 18 watt charger included in the box type C to type A cable and it'll actually do up to 15 watt wireless charging which is something that's a bit of a new feature in these more budget oriented phones. What I'm trying to figure out right now is what the heck TCL means by Super Bluetooth connect up to four devices. I think what they're talking about is Bluetooth 5.1 or 5.2, each of which have new operational modes. It's 5.1. So that's probably what their branding as Super Bluetooth. Interesting, no that seems to be a 5.2 features, so I wonder if this is one of the cases where they've got 5.1 certified hardware but they've managed to get 5.2 features running on it. We've seen that kind of thing in HDMI standards before I don't pretend be an expert when it comes to Bluetooth standards but there's clearly a precedent for it. This video is brought to you by MANSCAPED their performance package kit has everything you'll need to stay groomed from head to toe. It features their Lawn Mower 3.0 waterproof trimmer with skin safe technology as well as their Weed Whacker, ear and nose, hair trimmer for those tricky to reach areas. For a limited time you'll get the kit plus two free gifts The Shed travel bag and MANSCAPED Anti-chafing boxer briefs. So don't wait, go to manscape.com/circuit to get 20% off and free shipping. Another thing that's really nice to see is like a value phone for whatever reason, you end up with more features than you do on higher end phones from a certain point of view. So on the bottom we find our SIM tray, and would you look at that? You got your SIM, you got your micro SD, freaking love it, and then check this out, bam, headphone jack, IR emitter, it's like, what year is it? It's almost like all those features that existed on phones before could be integrated into modern phones for next to nothing and still hit a reasonable price point. Wow, others could learn a thing or two. Get this it even has FM radio apparently. So we'll be listening to the radio ladies and gentlemen, you got to put in headphones as an antenna. Look at that it's finding all the local stations it's got that QM-FM, get that JR-FM, a little bit of country. Gotta find the right... Don't wanna touch that cable. How's our sound on this puppy? Oh, no amplified earpiece speaker, well, something had to give. Actually for that matter I don't think it has officially any kind of waterproof rating either does it. With that said it did have a gasket around the SIM slot. So I suspect it's one of those things where they're not paying for the certification but it probably has some water resistance because the thing about consumers is even if the phone is not rated as being water resistant, they will still try to ramy a phone that they like water damage so it's in phone manufacturers best interest even if they don't have a rating to have it have some water resistance. The reason that haptic motor doesn't feel as good doing this as it did when I was typing, when I was typing it felt like pretty darn good for a budget phone. Not that this is strictly speaking a budget phone more of a mid range phone. Let's check the speed of the fingerprint reader, I'm expecting it to be fine. It's a little slow, but it's fine. Yep. Well, yeah, but Samsung's is really slow and I've been taking crap for years for saying that Samsung's fingerprint sensor is not fast and it's still not fast, I'm sorry. One of the key features of this phone is of course it's 700 nit peak brightness display and certification for Netflix HDR. Not mind blowing like some of the new Apple or Samsung devices, but more than competent and I got to say, this might be an unpopular opinion but I am a big fan of the skinny tall displays. It's not great for certain types of content. Like if you're the kind of person who's scrolling on Facebook, you're end up watching 16:9 videos of this like little tiny sliver of your display. But if you watch movies on your phone which I do or if you scroll text content a lot which I also do the taller display is for me anyway better than the wider one. Of course, we should probably talk about the camera a little bit. So 48 megapixel main shooter with three additional ones. So what is it like two mega pixel depth, five megapixel macro and then I think it's like a 16 megapixel ultra wide. Yep, that's a cell phone camera all right. Colors are a little muted and uninspiring and I can tell that it's not just the display being crap cause the display is not it looked great in \"Spider-Man\", but that's TCLs expertise I would expect them not to screw that up. Remember their background is like TVs and stuff. So there's our ultra wide lens. Then it's to identify that Andy's wearing a black shirt and to not a gray one. The lttstore.com that mouse pad is a little more vibrant in the ultra wide. Just record me some video. Oh yeah, the color is super unexceptional. I mean, it is a challenging situation cause it's like into the light, but even this is like, eh, not great. It's always like that when you're not buying I mean pretty much an iPhone or like a top tier phone where you'll get that inconsistency in the color science between the different lenses which are of course completely separate cameras. Wow, that's a lot of glass splinters that could end up in my finger. Selfie camera actually stand out like dang that's no like weird stupid smoothing or anything like that. Like that's for better or for worse what I look like I need a haircut. And this is a lot of out trolling this video subscribe to ShortCircuit for more videos like this one. Looks like from a just fit and finish and overall feature standpoint TCL has a winner on their hands here. So good job guys and good job you guys for making it to the end of the video.",

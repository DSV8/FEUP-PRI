    "transcript": "- What's up guys? Lou here back with another video and today I've got something special for you. In front of me is something you've probably seen. It is this controversial Apple battery case for the iPhone 6S with this strange design. I decided to take it upon myself to crack this baby open and to look inside to see what it's made of. To maybe gather some insight as to why it was designed in the way that it was. What do you need? I've got a screwdriver, TORX T3. I've got a little spudger, some tweezers, a couple of different knives. Probably overkill, to be completely honest with you. Like many Apple products, this thing is not very easy to get into. We're gonna need a little bit of carnage here. I'm gonna start over on the edge and prying up this cover here. It's just a little bit of adhesive, I guess, that's holding it down. It appears to just peel off. Some of you guys might not know, but my background before I ever got in to making YouTube videos was actually working on laptops, specifically MacBooks and whatnot. So, I've been inside a lot of laptops and various gadgets, so I'm pretty comfy in here. And if you guys wanna see tear downs of other gadgets that you're interested in, let me know down in the comments what you wanna see next. So, this just comes right off here. Wow, that's actually on there. Okay, so we've got the back cover off now. So, the next part, you're gonna notice, is this metal plate which looks like its been scratched up. Probably intentionally so that that material could adhere to it with whatever adhesive they're using. Now, a bunch of screws. Totally overkill on the screws here. Let's go ahead and twist those babies out. In this particular case you'd want to be super cognizant of where you're putting these tiny, little screws. It does look like they made it somewhat accessible here. If you've got the right equipment, you can actually get in here. Now, let's see if this just comes right out. There you go. So, you've just got a plate there. As well as a little bit of padding. Probably also has some kind of anti-static type of treatment potentially on it there. Now, this is what you guys are gonna be interested in. We've got confirmation on the specifications here. 3.8 volt lithium ion polymer battery. 7.13 watt hours, 1877 mil amp hours. We can also see where it came from. Dynapack Electronic Technology Suzhou Co Limited. A bunch of Chinese writing, of course. And a potential for fire or burning. Authorized service provider only. You're looking at him. Now, what's interesting here is you have some different certifications from different places. You can see Thailand listed here. Apple South Asia, you also have Apple Japan in this location here. Now, there is a tiny, little logic board down on the bottom. That's kind of interesting. There's some feedback between the battery and your phone. The phone gets to know what the battery status is. How much charge remains and whether or not it's discharging to the phones battery at any given time so you've got some electronics there to support that. The next step, I believe, is to remove the battery itself. Looks like a little, yep there we go, okay. So, it's a little stick-on connector. Not soldered on, which is kind of interesting. So, maybe Apple does intend on replacing these. That baby is glued in there. My goodness. Whoo! There we go. There is your battery right there. Funny, that's all the magic right there. There's your hundred dollars. We can actually just lift that right out of there. There is the logic board. Tiny little thing and then that's essentially all the electronics in this device. That little, tiny thing right there. Simple electronics really made this thing what it is. A pretty standard lithium polymer battery. So, not necessarily any kind of insight into why this would have been the design. A very utilitarian style design. They were just like get the battery in there. Get a metal plate around it and put a standard case on it. This is your average, every day, rubber-ish case with a backpack, or as I called it in the last video, Mt. Kilamanjaro. Hope you guys found this insightful. Potentially the start of a very cool new series where I can continue to show you the insides of your favorite gadgets. Let me know in the comments what do you wanna see next on Inside Out.",

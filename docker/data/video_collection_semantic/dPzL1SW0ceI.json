    "transcript": "- Hey guys, welcome to the Apple event coverage. I'm gonna be watching it live and reacting, but obviously this isn't live live, so get hyped with me while we watch. Oh boy, okay, I need to get my notes open, so I have my notes over here, I've got the event here, I've got my coffee, I've got Mario for moral support, I've got my phone, I've got water. Wow, wow, wow. - There's an Apple watch SE! Oh my God, it's available this Friday! This Friday! Aww Oh God, I have not fallen. (gulp sound) I'm trying to take notes, tweets. Fight with people on Twitter. Why do we need $10 a month? (clickety clack) Freaking Friday, Apple is doing a fitness service, shredded. I'm gonna be so fit! We're moving on to iPad. I don't know what's happening (indistinct). Sassing you on Twitter? I literally...(inaudible mumbling) I love that Craig just keeps getting in the way, Every time he's always hanging out. There's so many iPads. So many iPads, so little time. So it's over, it's over. It's like they didn't even mention the iPhone, because we know that, there's gonna be another event. Now let's talk about everything that we just saw. I'm so excited. The event is over. So we're gonna go through some of the things, really quickly and be sure to check out, youtube.com/same brain. My sister and I will be doing, a very in depth podcast talking about, all of the things that we announced, but I'm just going to go through some of the highlights. Number one, the most exciting thing is the Apple watch series six. I am such a huge fan of the Apple watch. The Apple watch has helped me actually get in shape and sort of quantify what I'm doing. Is it actually working? Am I actually closing my rings? Am I doing nothing all day? It lets me know. We can now track blood oxygen levels. This is something that I've wanted for a really long time in the Apple watch. And it is now here, there is an all new health sensor on the back that uses infrared. And you can just track your blood oxygen just like you normally would take your heart rate or do an ECG. There's also a new Ballou, aluminum pace. There's an updated classic gold stainless steel and an all new Apple Watch product red, which looks really cool as for which one I'm going to get. I'm not sure yet. The series six has two X brighter, outdoor, always on display. And it has an always on altimeter, which is great for hiking. My sister and I used to hike a lot. So we would love to be able to track that. So now that that is something that is on the always on display is going to be super helpful. There's new watch faces. There's a bunch of new ones. There's a new me, emoji watch space, which is really cool. You can customize it and you could interact with it. This is the solo loo. It is one infinite band that will go around your wrist and they have a bunch of different sizes. They said, this is one of the most comfortable Apple watch bands ever. And I love the sport loop like this bang is super comfortable. So I'm very excited to test this out. There's no plastic, no buckle. Just one continuous piece made of custom liquid silicone. A also did a braided solo loop version. So this is made of recycled yarn also looks cool into the pink color. So obviously if you have an Apple watch, you're well aware that it does have to pair to a phone. So they now have this thing called family setup, which allows users to pair watches for children or other family members who might not have their own phone or might not have an iPhone. So say somebody is, you know, over there on team Android and they don't have an iPhone, but they want an Apple watch. They can sync their Apple, watch to your iPhone and still have all of the great iPhone features. Although the fitness tracking, all of those sorts of things, it just won't link to their phone, which they probably would with want notifications on. I don't know. Hmm. Series six starts at 399 and there's a new Apple Watch SE that starts at 279. So there's a lot of different options. A varying range of prices are basically Apple Watch for a lot of different people. Oh my goodness. Oh, by the way, available Friday. No, it says you can order today. Today. Yeah. Today and it's available this Friday. Which one are we going to get? Which one do we think? What color? Oh my God, I'm going to, I really, I gotta get it. I got, we're going to get what color and probably going to get the gold millimeters loop stainless steel. Which one should I get? I'm shook. I don't know what to do. I think I make it stainless steel or should I not? I don't know what to do. I'm so stressed. I can't make decisions for myself any longer. I think I'm going to get the same list deal. Wait a minute. How, what is the size of my wrist? Hold on, there's a principle tool. Okay. So the number, the arrow is my band size. I'm a five, Oh God. I don't know one with the loop doesn't ship until September 25th. Well, I have five Apple watches in my cart right now. Graphite stainless steel. It's going to look really good with a pink band. Moving on. Apple watch has been ordered. Next up is Apple fitness. Plus, this is really exciting because they now have fitness trainers. They have on demand workouts that will be coming out. They said by the end of this year, any screen anywhere, anytime what's really cool is it does integrate with your Apple watch, so you can get all of the metrics on screen that is powered by the watch. It is an add on it is 999 a month. This is really really cool because I feel like now a lot of people aren't going to the gyms as much anymore because they're all close to being able to have something like this and work out at home is super, super exciting. Is as fitness plus is launching with the most popular workout types, yoga, cycling dance at treadmill walk, treadmill run, strength, core, hit rowing and mindful cooldowns. They've also announced Apple one. So this is a way to sort of bundle all of Apple's subscription services into one thing, which is great. So for individual it's 1499 a month, you'll get Apple music, Apple TV, Arcane, and iCloud. A family is 1995 a month. You'll get those same things, but you can have that trickle down to the rest of your family. Premier is 2995 a month. You'll get Music, TV, Arcade, iCloud news, and the new fitness, which is pretty exciting. Next up, we've got the iPad. So this is something that has been rumored for quite a while. So this is the eighth gen iPad. They're saying that this is a big year for iPad. So earlier this year, they did make some updates to the iPad pro and today they updated the rest of the full size iPad lineups. They've got an eight, 12 chip, 40% faster CPU, two X faster graphics, the iPad, eighth gen supports full-size smart keyboard plus existing of a third party keyboards. As well as the Apple pencil, they showed off a bunch of demos using iOS 14, which is also going to be out tomorrow. So exciting. Next up is the iPad air. This was an all new redesign. They have five colors of the iPad air. And I was actually pretty surprised by this, when they started playing the little intro, I was like, that's, that was, those are colors. There's the new Rose gold, a green and sky blue. So now they have five total colors. And before we go any further, we just need to, we need to let the class know that there is touch ID in the power button, which makes me so excited because this might mean that the iPhone could potentially have this technology. If they're putting this in the iPad air, this this could be setting a precedent and another thing USB C charging. USB C in the iPad air. I'll stand up, for that one. (clothes zipper sounds) Now give us USB C in the freaking iPhone. (falling object sound) And then, we are talking. (heavy breathing) Right now I have an elevated heart rate. Will USB C charging be in the iPhone? I don't know it's in your iPad air. You can make it happen. They show this really cool demo of DJ pro AI. It basically like just uses the front camera and you can become a DJ. It's my future. The iPad air starts at five 99 and it will be available next month. So soon. I think one of the things that I'm really excited about with the iPad air is the performance. It is going to be 40% faster compared to the previous iPad air. And so many people now are working from home. Kids are using these devices as their main learning tool. Like people are doing everything completely differently and using these devices differently. So this is very exciting and it's going to be a great addition to the iPad lineup. So I'm hyped. I can't believe that everything is here. Now, my friends, we wait for the iPhone announcement. You guys who are new to my channel. Hi, I'm just eating. I make a lot of fun tech videos. Obviously I'm a huge Apple fan. So I will be covering all of the Apple products, very extensively here on my channel and on my podcast with my sister, Same Brain. So you are already subscribed. Please do so and hit the bell to be notified when I post a new video and we all know that I just bought a new Apple watch. So guess what? You'll see it soon. Good bye. (upbeat music) I haven't even thrown anything yet. - [Camera Guy] There's nothing you can throw. - There's nothing I can throw. It's (indistinct), too many expensive things around. I don't know what I'm doing. I need help.",

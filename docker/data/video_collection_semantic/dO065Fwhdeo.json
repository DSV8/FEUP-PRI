    "transcript": "As the evening sets in... the people of Los Angeles begin to party. Will you be one of them? What's up guys, Lew here, back with a very special edition of \"3 Cool Tech Deals\". As you can tell, I am outside. Yes, every so often, I do leave the studio. Especially, if I'm in LA... and the weather is wonderful, like it is right now. So before the sun goes down, I wanted to hit you with some Hot... ...tech deals. These will be like... Pre... ...Black Friday, pre-Cyber Monday. Everybody's gettin' ready for all that mayhem. Maybe you want to skip the mayhem. Well maybe you want to start shopping... Right Now. As in today. As in the moment that you're watching this. So that's what this video is for! To kick it off... We've got a gigantic... and enormous... Super speed USB 3.0 hub. With thirteen ports. Those people... who wanna compete... for USB ports? This is your winner right here. Quite affordable, too! It's $39. And two of the thirteen ports are high powered. Meaning they charge at... 2 Amps... 2.4 Amps. The concept here is... to expand either your laptop or your desktop, so, you can keep all of your peripherals connected and then remove one cable... And go. Giant... USB hub... for all your gadgets. You could be as happy as these people right here. I have a feeling this is one of those items that's always fairly marked down, but $39.99 seems to be a pretty good deal for that. And the reviews are also good, so there you have it. NEXT UP: We've got a GIANT micro SD card. Hundred and fifty bucks from SanDisk. \"SanDisk Ultra 200GB Micro SD.\" Up to 90MB/second transfer speeds. Maybe you're thinkin': \"I don't need 200GB of Micro SD storage.\" The reason why I thought this one was interesting is... With the rollout of YouTube Red and the ability to take videos offline, which I've already been doing. All of a sudden: Micro SD cards have become a little bit more interesting, as well as phones that can support Micro SD. Because now... You got this... huge... cool... video jukebox of your favourite YouTube videos, music videos off YouTube, Etc, Etc. Two hundred gigs, hundred and fifty bucks... 40 percent off... SanDisk. Well done. Next: This one's kinda interesting. Now don't be turned off, immediately by... the \"Tropical\"... pattern there. You can get this iPhone 6 case... or 6s case, in a number of different standardised colors, like black, red, white, and so on. Gold, if you're about that bling. So this is kind of a standardised TPU bumper case, but it has a little secret compartment on the back. As you can see here in the image: For storing two cards. Could be a credit card. Could be an ID. There are some cool designs as well, like that space one is not bad. And it just sorta slides up! You get access to your cards, of course, and all your ports and whatnot. You have access to those, too. I just thought it was a cool little feature that you don't see on every case and it's only fifteen bucks. $15.99 to be exact. At this point the deal is four percent claimed. (At the time of recording - ED) In the past: Things I've shown on \"3 Cool Tech Deals\" have completely sold out. Dont... ...Let it be you... ...Who has to cry that single tear... ...When that thing you wanted is all gone. LASTLY: Not exactly a tech deal. The \"iPong Topspin Table Tennis\" This is an honourable mention just because... the thing looks cool as hell. *Laughter*And it shoots ping pong balls. If you're a ping pong player, this is how you practice. You put a hundred and ten balls in here, they get fired at you real quick, and you're smackin' 'em back... Maybe you're not! A Table Tennis... ...player... Maybe you just wanna annoy somebody. Sit this thing somewhere across from them and... and rapid fire. No one's... No one's gonna be too hurt. Maybe a little bit annoyed... But they're gonna have ping pong balls flying at them. At an adjustable frequency of twelve... ...to seventy balls per minute. I was a little concerned about the cleanup, but no one... ever had any fun in their lives... ...being worried about the cleanup. There you have it! Three cool tech deals: outdoor edition! LA edition! West Coast edition! Thank you very much for watching! If you guys enjoyed this content, make sure to leave a thumbs up down below. Everything I mentioned is down in the description. All of the relevant links, so click those too. Get your link click on, And I'll catch you guys very shortly in the next episode. Later, guys. The LA sun waited for us, thank God.",

    "transcript": "After building your first pc, there are a few things you might want to address for instance if you're an overclocker you might want to tweak multipliers and vultures in your bios and you'll probably want to install graphics drivers unless you're a madman these are just some of the usual steps us computer enthusiasts run through after a fresh boot it's more like a ritual just a routine that we don't even really think about but there's one step that's often kicked under the rug just kind of overlooked in general especially by first time builders and that's adjusting fan speed that's what we're going to talk about in this video i'm going to walk you through step by step how to set one up so that you never have to worry about it again stay with me to get rid of that annoying activation watermark hop on over to vip std key and purchase a windows 10 pro oem key for fractions of the price of retail just use a secure payment method like paypal receive your key in seconds and activate your os here bye bye watermark and be sure to use our new offer code skgs for a sweet discount you might notice after turning your pc on for the first time that uh yeah your fans are well a bit loud and most of the time this is a consequence of biospan curve defaults in this case for some reason it's set to full speed that is definitely not needed with this kind of cooling most of the time this is a consequence of bios fan curve defaults which are typically far from ideal so each time you reset your cmos or build a brand new system you'll likely end up with this curve that just doesn't make any sense and most of the time it's again going to set your fans to higher operating rpms than you really need especially at idle when you don't necessarily need active cooling to that degree and they'll be operating like in the case of this pure wings 2 fan here well over a thousand rpm each these can run at below that 1000 rpm it's possible to do that here and this is a 4-pin fan it operates in pwm we have a video talking about pw if you want to know more about that and how it works and how you're able to get lower operating rpm or effective rpm as a result of this but this fan can ramp all the way up to 2000 rpm it says so right here on the back and let me tell you um i really like purewings 2 fans and especially silent wings 3 fans but they don't sound very good not that any fan does at 2000 rpm now as we said there are multiple ways to address this including with many third-party programs like corsair iq and nzxt cam but these are lower level solutions that won't kick in until the apps themselves have been opened meaning these settings won't take effect until after you've already logged into windows and allow these programs to open and run in the background my go-to for fan control is in the bios for this simple reason if i can help it right i'd prefer to keep as few programs running in the background as possible when i'm just on the computer doing anything at all though this can be difficult to avoid admittedly if you've also got say a corsair aio and some corsair ram right their iq software is going to kind of integrate everything including rgb control into one suite take it or leave it and of course there's always a case where your motherboard is either just too primitive or too old and it doesn't have an intuitive fan control platform sort of built into the uefi or bios and in those cases yes you'd have to use iq or cam or whatever your fan curve suite of choice is i suggest one that is not too heavy on system resources though especially if your system is rather weak so bios fan control is a much more passive yet still direct approach to controlling rpm and that's what we'll be taking advantage of in this video although the approach is fairly universal when it comes to third-party platforms as well to kick things off restart or power your system on while spamming the delete key this should take you to your motherboard's uefi from here navigate to the hardware monitor tab or maybe it's a q fan tab a lot of motherboards call this different things and i'm kind of annoyed by that it might be under the system tab or the motherboard tab it's kind of a mess refer to your manual if you are not sure or just start navigating around eventually you'll find it next you should see a tab similar to this one it's called something like fan tuning or again q fan there are often two kinds and you'll want to be careful about which one you select there's a certain kind of tuning and a lot of motherboards where the board itself will kind of see what the lowest operating rpm of a fan is and it'll do this for each fan or each header on the board and then determine what a stable fan curve should be based on that lowest operating rpm it works okay but it's still not as intuitive as manually controlling the curve which i'm going to show you now so if you found this manual control tab you should see a graph with multiple line segments like this and like this may be a bit daunting on the surface but it's actually straightforward along the x-axis we've temperature in degrees celsius and along the y-axis we have the selected fan duty cycle or operating speed by percent usually each of these points represents a target fan speed for a given temperature that's either the cpus or the motherboards some boards are even fancier and include other hotspots and things but typically instead of the cpu and motherboard and i like to use just the cpu temps in most cases since they often go hand in hand with motherboard temps anyway and you can see how as we slide this dot upward we're telling our computer to adjust fan speed accordingly if our cpu is at 40 degrees celsius we may only want a 30 or 40 percent duty cycle but if our cpu gets quite hot we'll of course want a value much higher than this so you'll often see this chart trend upward with a positive slope as it really makes no sense to lower fan speeds as system internals heat up that would be um yeah a bit counter-intuitive the goal is to keep temps as low as possible right without compromising too much in the way of fan speed and noise now depending on the fan and header you may be able to set a very low first target so something like 30 degrees celsius and i don't know a 30 percent fan load this is something i always try to start with if i can and then i create a trend sort of like this as we approach 70 or 80 degrees celsius with the slope gradually increasing the hotter the system gets this should keep your system extremely quiet at idle and moderate load right however if things do get too hot we've the last resort segment on our fan curve that bumps things up to 100 some maximum cooling potential some motherboards allow for the addition of extra segments even in this chart so you can get to higher degrees of precision if you want although i found that a solid three or four points is generally enough to make fan rpm predictable and tolerable under varying degrees of load you'll also want to take cooler size and tdp into consideration here since cpu coolers with smaller heat sinks and fans will likely need to run more aggressive curves than those with larger layouts you may not in those cases want to start with say a 30 duty cycle maybe a 50 or 60 will do now for a bit of added clarity the x-axis here is pretty straightforward right i mean that's just your cpu temperature at least what i would recommend setting it to cpu temperature but the corresponding fan load will vary depending on the make model and whether it supports pwm see 40 load for one fan may not result in the same rpm as forty percent load for another also we have an entire video discussing what pwm is again and how it generally is superior to voltage controlled fans which are three pin fans but in essence this modulation allows for a lower operating rpm than your standard three pin which means you can essentially fine-tune these a bit more bring operating rpms down to again that 30 target you probably won't be able to do that with a voltage fan now once you've finished calibrating the curve you'll want to select the headers to which the curve applies in general i like to use the same curve for all case and cooler fans say maybe in the event i'm custom cooling with larger radiators depends on the setup and as for pumps which this build has i usually run them at either 80 90 or 100 rpm constantly now you might be thinking well greg that doesn't sound too healthy a pump shouldn't be running at 100 all the time actually that's what they're designed to do now it is possible that for them to run with a curve similar to fans right where they kind of increase in slope as temperature increases but i prefer a constant speed for the possibility of less stress and variation in fluid velocity generally you want heat removed from sinks as quickly as possible and the medium responsible for this and aios and custom loops is generally water or glycol-based solution and the pump is what accelerates that process my rule of thumb if you can hear your pump at 100 load maybe lower it by 10 increments until it becomes virtually inaudible but still widely effective most acetech pumps which this aio uses are already relatively quiet at 100 load in fact it's at 100 load now and you probably can't even hear it now some d5 and ddc pumps may need a bit of tweaking which is why i said just back off in 10 increments until it is no longer super audible the d5 pump in my most recent uh jesse pinkman custom loop was pretty loud at 100 load so i backed it off to i think 70 and i'm pretty happy with that and once you've saved these configurations in your bios or uafi whenever you start your pc your fan curve should kick in almost immediately you shouldn't need to rely on any third-party software you can even save profiles to a thumb drive or the board itself in some cases for quick swaps depending on your environment this will also help to restore settings in the event you need to clear your CMOS and your board doesn't retain custom settings by default hopefully this straightens things out a bit for first-time builders and those who need a quick refresher never hurts again there are multiple ways to fine tune fan curves but this is the way i've always done it at least with boards that you know pack the support it's simple it's quick and it's low profile that's all for this one if you enjoyed it or learned a thing or two be sure to click the like button that would be

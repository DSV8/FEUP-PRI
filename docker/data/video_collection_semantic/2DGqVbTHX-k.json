    "transcript": "It is still November, so it is stillwithout effort. That sound? The heats running. I didnt shut it off! Itll turnoff eventually, but for now? White noise! Before the video starts, fair warning: snark levels are pretty high in this one. Uh, even I think I may have gone a little far herebut, um, yknow Im just trying to make the world a better place in my admittedly over-the-topfrustrated way. Anyway, cmon lets go. So theres this thing we do here in the US withoutlets: we sometimes put em on a light switch. And this annoys the crap out of some folks. Ihave a simple goal today: to explain what this is for (because a good number of people seeminglyhavent figured it out) and to encourage you to take advantage of it which will, if done properly,also alleviate your frustration and confusion. Speaking of confusion, I dont mean that some of our outlets have switches on them like you might find in the UK or Australia orprobably some other places. Thats essentially never a thing here, and whenit is its definitely a weird special case. I was gonna go on a rant here for like the third time about how this isnt an issue at all and I dont get why those of you thinkan outlet needs a switch, especially when you think it adds a layer of safety because the switch is right next to the plug which you can also just take out if theres an emergency but I decided against it. Except for that bit. *clears throat* No, what I mean is that inmany homes (and even hotel rooms) you will sometimes find an outlet which is dead. Butits not permanently dead, instead its been wired to a light switch somewhere else in theroom. Why is that? Because lamps are a thing! And if you plug a lamp into that outlet which is controlled with the light switch, suddenly the light switch becomes a lightswitch. As in a switch which turns on a light. See, unlike some places, we dont do thewhole lighting circuit and receptaclecircuit business. Well OK we usuallyseparate them these days so a breaker trip due to an overloaded outlet wont kill thelights in the room but what I mean is that a light switch is rated to interrupt the whole 15A of a typicalcircuit, and 20A switches are plenty common, too. That means that we can use them as aswitch for literally anything poweredby a 120V circuit. So we sometimes use themto interrupt power to a specific receptacle or receptacles in a room in order to provide aremote control for a lamp or lamps. Thats the point of it! Its not just to be confusing, its to provide a remote control for a lamp. Trouble is, this isnt always done in the bestway. But before we get there, some context. When electrification was just getting started, its killer app was the light bulb. Snap-on electric lights meant no more kerosene, nomore gas, and people were excited to have them. Low-effort lighting was *the point* of gettingelectrical service, and in fact in some places youll still hear people refer to their light bill and not their power bill. The earliest adopters of these newfangled electric lights were getting wires run to each room for alight socket, often hanging from the ceiling, with a switch by the door for controlling it. And that was it. The idea of a receptaclefor powering other things just didnt exist yet. The Edison screw socket predates the receptacle by a couple of decades. But we would swiftly find other uses for thiselectricity business. Perhaps the first ever dongle was an adapter for converting an Edison screw socket into a two-pronged, flat-blade receptacle which received a matchingplug - the brainchild of Harvey Hubbell in 1903. Hubbells plug design would eventually bestandardized and now we had an opportunity to put these so-called outlets in whereverplaces in whatever rooms for whatever stuff. And one of those stuffs... was lamp! Yearning for thecalm glow and versatility of moveable lamps once again, well the trends shifted away from draboverhead lighting and towards floor and table lamps which you could place wherever you like. But people did really like those light switches which let you brighten a room as you enteredit. So somebody asked Por que no las dos? and the switched outlet was born. Instead of runningpower from a switch to a light fixture overhead, it went instead to an outlet somewhere in theroom. Just plug your lamp into that one and youll have the best of both worlds. This wassuch a common thing that many homes built in the middle of the last century have rooms withno light fixtures at all, but a light switch by the door is still there to control lamps froma distance. But now, as trends have steadily moved back towards overhead lighting, manypeople seem to hate this idea with a passion. Now, when this is implemented poorly, displeasure with the concept is understandable. And implementation is poor with distressing frequency. For instance, did you know that duplex receptacles can be split into two halves? In my home, everyreceptacle location with a switched outlet has one side of it hot-at-all-times. This is done bybreaking this little tab on the receptacle. Then, two hot wires are run to the box: one goingthrough the light switch by the door, and the other coming straight from the electrical panel. We can now wire the switched hot to one side, and the always-hot to the other side of thesame outlet. So now you can plug a lamp into the switched side and use the other half for yourphone charger or whatever. You could even use a splitter like this and still plug two thingsinto the other side. But you might have an outlet where both halves are switched at the sametime. Nice if you happen to want two lamps plugged in at that location, but annoying in literallyall other cases. If youre stuck with an outlet like that in an otherwise really convenientlocation, I get why you would be bothered. But when its done right, this is actually a verynice thing to have. To possibly convince you, Id like to walk you throughsome options at your disposal. First of all, if youre annoyed by an outlet likethis in your home because you keep forgetting its on a switch and so plug stuff into it only to find out that its dead, or worse plug important things into it which you accidentally switch off, heres an easy way to fix that: Go to store. Or website! Obtain lamp. Plug lampinto outlet. Now outlet has lamp in it. Leave lamp switched on. Now light switch does thing! Leavelamp plugged in all the time confusion over. The heat switched off. Seriously. If you dont truly need that outletfor anything else, try using it for what its for! A lamp! There are tons of inexpensivefloor lamps and table lamps out there, plenty of which are sleek and dont take up much space at all. Next time you need meatballs swing by the lighting department and a whole $10 willget you this thing. Or check out your local thrift store for some cheap and often groovy fare. Ithink you will be surprised at how drastically different your living spaces will feel whenlit by a floor lamp in the corner instead of a boob light on the ceiling. Its a much calmeratmosphere. More and more folks are seeing the benefits of not-overhead lighting, and you cancount me among the enlightened. Bottom line, if you keep the switched outlet occupied by alamp, not only will you maybe get to use that light switch as intended, but youll keep yourselffrom plugging something else into it. Win win. Now, if you cant be bothered to get a lamp, you can mark that outlet somehow so you know that one is switched. And actually, asomewhat common convention is to install outlets that are switched upside-downso they can be identified at a glance. It doesnt work quite as well where we like toinstall outlets sideways for some reason, but anyway you can also get a sharpie and put a dot over theswitched outlet, or you can cover it with tape, or you can get those little covers forbabies, or you could put tape over the switch, or you could get one of those anti-tamper coversand put it over the switch, or you could even go so far as to permanently bypass the switch, really there are just so many things you could do besides get frustrated over and over again. Its not the switchs fault you havent done that. *clears throat* Uh, but what about when things area bit weird? For instance, all too frequently you find that the outlet on a switch justhappens to be the one closest to the switch. When you see that, you know someone was doing thebare minimum to meet code. See, its required that every room have a light switch as you enterit. That can either control an overhead light or it can go to an outlet to power a lamp. Buttheres no rule on where that outlet needs to go, and when five feet of wire is cheaper than 25feet, well you know which option's gonna get taken. This can feel particularly silly since pretty much any lamp will have its own switch, and if its right there as you enter the room, the switchon the wall doesnt add much. My previous home was like this in the living room and bedrooms, andwhile the silliness factor didnt bother me itwas fairly limiting. I would have much preferredthe lamp be in the opposite corner of the room, and while extension cords *could* get me there, it would be pretty silly to run such a long one along two entire walls along. However, even thougha situation like that isnt ideal, I would still argue the light switch is much easier to use. Nofumbling in the dark with the lamp or reaching for its cord. But what about when you put a lamp on a switchedoutlet that you also want to control with itsown switch? Well, I wont lie - there isthe potential for conflict here. But how frustrating this is will be in the eye of thebeholder. For instance, [phone dings] in this bedroom don't worry about that there is an outlet behind each nightstand. Both of them,actually, are split in half so the light switch by the door can control a lamp on both sides. So,the bedside lamps can be turned on as you enter the room. Thats nice - you dont have to crossa dark room to turn them on. Again - thats the point! A remote control for lamps! But supposeafter youve turned them on, you want to settle into bed and then turn them off from there? Well,and this might shock you, you can still do that! However, if in the morning you dont turnthe lamps back on before you get out of bed, you might end up in a situation inwhich the switch by the wall doesnt work anymore. But heres the thing, and Ihate to be the one to break this to you, if that happens... you did it to yourself. Im notsaying this cant be confusing. I myself have been befuddled by a light switch that isnt doinganything because the lamp its controlling is switched off. But depending on your circumstances, this might be really useful. Take the bedroom example. Turn the lights on as you enter, turnthem off when youre in bed. When you wake up, turn them back on from bed and now you canswitch them off when you leave the room! Then, throughout the day the light switch will serve to illuminate the room as you come and go. I find this really useful! But it does requirethinking ahead and turning at least one of the lamps back on. Which, depending on how earlyyou wake up, you might need to do anyway! Personally, I really like the flexibility thatswitched outlets provide. I can rearrange a room and change the lighting to my tastes withouttearing walls apart and redoing the electrical work. And with properly split outlets, Im noteven losing any utility thanks to splitters like these. Now I should address - some of you might find it funny that Im OK with outlet splitters given that I made a video on how our extension cordsare not great. See, splitters dont introduce those same risks. Unless its a terrible-qualitysplitter, it should be able to handle a full 15A just fine. Often theyve got thick brasslinks in there so they dont concern me. My beef with extension cords is that many are sold which cannot handle 15A and without a built-in fuse to limit them to their rated rating, its possible (if unlikely in the grand scheme) for the cord to become a problem as the circuit breaker protectingthat circuit wont intervene. But I digress. I was saying that I really like the flexibilitythat switched outlets provide. When I built-out this room for filming, I ran a separate switchedfeed throughout. I used two-gang boxes for four plugs at each location, and I bought greyreceptacles for the switched side. The set is powered through the switched leg and so when I come down here to film I just go *foop* and the set lights up with NO EFFORT. There it is. I also pluganything that might be hazardous into the grey outlets so that I have an extra layer of assurance I didnt leave something on that I shouldnt have. Ive even used dimmer switches on switched outlets- which Im sure is a terrifying thought to someof you, but see, you plug the lamp into it andthen you dont touch it again. Thats actually, like... it's a big part of my confusion towards theconfusion here. Yeah, when you move into a new place it takes a while to figure this stuff out. But once you do - well now you know! When youre traveling, I get it. Especially in a hotel room -it might be really frustrating to plug something in and not have it work. It might even get youinto a jam if you needed something to charge overnight. But now that you know this is a thing, justmake sure whatever youre using is working before you go to bed. If its not, try another outlet or see if theres a light switch thats turned off. Now there are old setups out there whichare just flat out bad. More than one person has told me their home has a bathroom where the outlets only have power whenthe lights are on. In other words, theswitch interrupts all power to the room. I can sort-of see the logic there - one mightask what could you do in a bathroom with the lights out that needed power, and it provides abit of reassurance against leaving a curling iron or something turned on. But now with rechargeable toothbrushes, razors, and whatnot, that schemeis all sorts of inconvenient. But the idea of using a light switch to controlan outlet so that you can turn on a lamp as you entera room (and indeed turn it off as you leave) is pretty good. And you, like me, might imagine uses for this outside of simple lamps! So yeah,next time you get mad at one of these switched outlets - give some thought to what you could dowith it. You might just learn to appreciate it. confoundingly smooth jazz I think theres a mouse in here. Anyway,um, I dunno if theres gonna be bloopers because there werent that many screw-ups. I didnt the camera didnt stop did it? Are you kidding? I did this in 20 minutes? Well, youthought this wasnt No Effort November. Guffaw! But people did really likethose light switches wit let you [mouth stumbles] the light switch by the door can control a lullabehdehbedehbuh doobedoobedoobedoobe doobedoobedoobedoobe doobedoobedoobedoobe doobedoobedoobedoobe doobedoobedoobedoobe ba dah ba baaaaaaaaa baaaaaaah ba de baaa da ba de baaaa boo DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",

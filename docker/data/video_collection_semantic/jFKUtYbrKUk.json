I \"recorded\" multiple clips on multiple SD cards and was unable to retrieve a single functional video file. Yes, it appears that this contraption sucks!

    "transcript": "So every once in a while I let Jack pick an item to be featured here on the show Is it a terrible idea? I think so. You might too. To let Jack do anything in fact Surprised this place hasn't burned down So what does he do with all of that freedom to select an item he buys these right here. What are they Jack? Are they the glasses of businessmen? No, they're not! They're some kind of perverted camera glasses. Hitting inside of these frames is a 1080p camera or so it says. 1080p HD camera eyewear. Works with Windows 2000 in case you're wondering! In all seriousness I don't know maybe you're a investigative journalist. You want to head over to McDonalds to prove that the the Big Mac on the picture isn't the one that showed up in front of you when you bought it and now you're mad! Maybe it'll end up on WorldStarHipHop. Maybe that's who these glasses are for. The reporters of WorldStarHipHop. Can I open the damn box yet Jack? Holy! Called Toughsty. Have you ever seen a happier man? It all started when he got his pervert glasses. Things started to look up. Oh! OK. Here we go, there's a power brick that looks like they hijacked it out of a box for an iPhone or something like that. Cleaning cloth, a USB cable to keep it charged. And I know these are not prescription. Ooh! Hahaha nobody, actually you know what? The way they have it kind of as a...looks almost like a screw. Would you be able to tell something is wrong here? I don't know if you're kind of a slick dude, maybe you could get away with this and people don't even know you're recording. So I'd like to order a Big Mac. Of course I'd like some fries as well. Was that English or Irish, what was it? It was neither. It was a leprechaun. How do you even there's a button on the inside. I must be...blue light went off. Ooh that looks like the camera and that's like a little tiny light there. I'm guessing the microphone is on the other side, now it's flashing blue. Now that's off. Maybe I do need the user manual. Look at the way these sneaky dudes put the SD card in here and to get it out, it's a microSD, it's easiest if you just use like a knife and kind of pry it up. Look at this. It's sneaky the way it's in there. So that's an 8 gig There's only one button on the unit and one light so there's kind of a technique here Apparently you press it and hold it until you get the blue light its supposed to flash a couple times and that's when the recording starts. I do not see that happen right now. Oh there now we're flashing.It flashed one time and then off. Think we're recording now? Okay so they are supposedly recording now. Alright anger times doesn't happen often. My spy glasses aren't doing any spying. They suck! Alright multiple SD cards we tried. Tried reformatting multiple times, we got a bunch of broken files that couldn't be played and couldn't be repaired, and then on top of that many times nothing was recorded at all. And after a recharge for half an hour it's not even turning on anymore so.. looks like it's a resurrection of the Does it suck series and we have a resounding yes! Toughsty, more like sucksky.",

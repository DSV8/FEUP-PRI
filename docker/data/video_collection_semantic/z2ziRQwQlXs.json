    "transcript": "Eber you see what I'm seeing yeah Silverstone baby let's go but first huge thanks to SteelSeries and Phanteks for making our Computex trip possible so let's begin with the LDO 3 this thing is finally finished and i remember originally seeing it at Computex and was this thing with acrylic side panels it was curved but I'm really happy at the end result this thing looks elegant I love the tempered glass especially how they are slightly cut off gives a really unique look it is an ITX enclosure so it's a little bit on the larger side but they make so many tiny as g-series ITX cases that branching into something slightly bigger I'm totally ok with that the side panels as before are easily removable you simply pop them out like this to access the interior they have made a few modifications on the interior like having this big GPU cut out underneath that is so that you can maybe use that space too if you if you need additional space for the GPU which supports 12.1 inches or if you cannot mount the GPU from the side or from the front you can actually insert it from that hole and just makes the installation easier they've also removed the top bracket above the fan they had a tiny fan over there to have a little bit better airflow but throughout the testing they removed it because it didn't really help for any other GPUs other than blower cards and they've also made the case slightly wider so there's actually some ventilation behind the GPU for a little extra airflow because in the previous one the GPU was really close to the side panel so the ldr 3 is now shipping it's going to be for 109 dollars but for our us friends because of all the tariffs and canadians as well around 140 to 150 so that kind of sucks but one more thing bits power is working to create a custom reservoir slush pump for this enclosure so you can do full water cooling here I appreciate that little ITX enclosure with water cooling components this is how ITX should be done nicely done Silverstone now for many of you silverstone lovers you'll be happy to hear that they are actually condensing their entire case line up into three categories fara SATA and alte and that is because they currently have 14 different puddles so good luck trying to decipher that I mean still probably better than cooler masters mmm s/m lemon whatever thing but we have fairer SATA and Alta affair is the the lower tier budget entries SATA is something that we have here kind of a mid tier and out there really high-end stuff the reason why I'm showing you this this is the theta seder Seder a1 I'm already getting a little confused but yeah SATA a1 and the reason why I'm showing this is because there have this nice aluminum front panel and they're doing some trickery here because this is a dual material construction we have an aluminum piece over here but the actual frame behind it is plastic it is all silver so they look very similar and then we have the metal frame itself and they're hopefully trying to do the same thing in terms of color coordination but because of the LEDs it helps to kind of camouflage any color difference there might be and the question I have for you like I love this design but since you can't really see the fans underneath it what do you think about Silverstone including RGB fans in here right now there are 200 millimeter fans underneath two of them and they are RGB and you can kind of see them from the inside but would you guys prefer RGB fans on something that you can't see them from the front or do you care there's a tad I guess it adds a little bit of spill but I would love to hear your thoughts on something that where you can't see through the front panel there's RGB make any sense and now good people let's talk about the outer s1 so the outer is the really enthusiast premium line of cases and this is Silverstone answer to people's question about when they're gonna release a flagship case you really need the new flagship and the this like the really high-end stuff and this is what they've come up with so it is massive it is very spaceship looking it still has that Silverstone ID with the aluminum panels and tempered glass side panels which by the way are curved so we do have triple 200 member fans inside and you can mount radiators on top of the bracket so you don't necessarily need to waste the fans if you're going the whole water cooling route and the airflow in this sort of 90 degree chimney style has been fantastic they're still working on trying to make sure the performance is best as it can be because with non blower style GPUs there's a lot of heat that accumulates over here and even though we have that nice common air from the bottom to the top the the top section only still has that single exhaust fan which means that the CPU is cooled very well with either water cooling or AOS or CPU towers but the GPUs suffer a little bit and they still want to continue with this whole idea the front glass panel so you can see the GPUs and gets your entire system but I'm excited to see what they do in terms of improving those GPU temperatures but my friends let's go and check out the Raven prototype so this is the Raven prototype the expected price is from 180 to 200 dollars and of course much higher in the US market a few changes include a type-c connection on the side over here they've added a larger cutout from the front panel so that they're really sticking to being able to see your components from the front and simply because the motherboard is rotated 90 degrees so the GPU is going to be that highlight I like their approach but I guess we'll see how it plays out in terms of also being able to see your your motherboard cables and whatever else in there what if your GPU doesn't have a pretty backplate or actually pretty shroud what what are you gonna do they're just gonna cover it up they have closed the back panel so the airflow is more directional so there's no leakage happening from the rear they've added a vertical GPU bracket over here so that you could have a vertical rotated GPU so the shroud will be facing the side panel a really cool approach to an otherwise already vertical orientation of the graphics card we have dual 180 millimeter air penetrators fans so these are like super premium fantastic airflow and the only thing that oh the only reason why this is not on the market yet is because they're not happy with performance it's performing just as well as all their previous Raven Series cases and that is because the non Flores tile GPUs spit out a lot of heat and they don't know how to handle that exhaust over here the CPU temperatures are fine but like we saw with the outter this is going to go through a little bit of revisions so that they can have better performance and I'm really looking forward to see what they do with the Raven prototype so that the temperatures on the GPU are much better man every time we come to Silverstone they're like oh we have a new new power supply that is higher wattage so the power density is now increasing every year so now they have an SFX L power supply that there's a thousand watts instead of the previous one from two years ago that was 800 watts so that's pretty cool and interesting thing they tell us is that see these connections we have normally we see like six normally we see red or blue connectors that specify your CPU power and PCIe power but now they're all black which means that you can take any six pin or eight pin and plug it in here and use that corresponding to whatever you need on the motherboard so you have a little bit more options for the modularity of the unit and we also have now an S effects 750 watt unit they're now trying to match the Corsairs latest 750 SFX power supply versus previous this was 700 watts so again power density is increasing in power supplies which is awesome because the whole direction of s FX and s FF builds you know it's it's becoming more popular and silverstone is staying on top of their game and one more little thing they always have a bunch of little goodies over here like and now a PCIe expandable Gen 2 USB enclosure you can bounce an nvme m2 SSD inside of here and this is actually what we're using for the show but the SATA type which are awesome and we've we've done the video on this little clicker that you can plug this into your computer and wirelessly control it with the remote control but now they're doing a whole Wi-Fi connection over here so you plug this into your PCI and there's an app you can restart and power on your PC within the Adhan card pretty awesome for difficult to access places and if you want to really you know prank your roommates or by turning off their systems this is something that I'm really hoping to do in the future but yeah multiple accessories as usual alright guys so that is it from silverstone i'm really happy they're simplifying a naming scheme farah sada and alta so hopefully in the future it will be an easier distinction to to know which sort of series you'd want to go for and I'm really excited to check out the LDO 3 and see what they do with that raven prototype in terms of airflow for the GPU I'm Dimitri thanks so much for watching check out this other relevant content and I'll talk to you in the next video you",

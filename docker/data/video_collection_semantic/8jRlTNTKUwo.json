    "transcript": "- You know what's faster than 360 hertz? 390 hertz. We've got the Nitro XV2 series gaming monitor, from Acer. I don't know how you're gonna get faster than that unless you're LG I guess, with their 480, you said, Jono? So that's not coming out 'til later this year. For now, you're kinda stuck with something like this guy. They got their fancy Acer tape. I don't know if that's better than regular tape, but it says \"Acer\" on it. Trouble getting it out of the box. I mean, they got this packed in pretty good, I guess. Oh, what's this? Oh, okay, well here's the cables. Power cable, I guess. All right, standard C13. - [Jono] You gotta follow the instructions. - Where's the instructions? Oh yeah, it has instructions on the box, for how to unbox it. Who needs instructions for unboxing stuff? You don't need that. - [Jono] He's dropping it. - I'm not gonna drop. There we go. Nice little round base. Look at the stand. It's a little wiggly, but we haven't screwed it down yet, so that's okay. It doesn't look like it has much in terms of... That's it, that's all you get. I love pan and swivel, and tilt and stuff, and being able to actually move your monitor wherever you want. Display port cable. Power cable. Looks like that's actually pretty much it. Oh, this is neat, look, you can, I don't know why, but you can turn this. I guess so that you can turn the whole monitor on the stand, instead of swiveling it or whatever. That's cool. But hey, it's a 390 hertz monitor, you're not buying it for that. You're buying it so you can kill people in Counter-Strike and Valorant and whatever. What are kids playing, Fortnite? Get some more kills in Fortnite. Just clips onto the back here. There we go. Yeah, so you can go vertical, which is pretty cool, that always gets bonus points in my book. Gotta love when monitors come with manuals. I should probably move this out of the way. I mean, it's only a 24 and a half inch screen, I think, so that's not a whole lot of screen space, and it's 1080p. So it doesn't have G-Sync, it only has FreeSync, but FreeSync is pretty much just as good as G-Sync these days, anyway. Let's power this up. After a message from our sponsors, Vessi. Thanks, Vessi Footwear, for sponsoring today's video. Vessi Footwear is known for being lightweight, easy to pack, comfortable, and most importantly, waterproof. You don't have to worry about the weather anymore, the shoes are made with a material called Dyma-tex, which keeps your feet cool in the summer and warm in the winter. They're easy to slip on or off, and lots of us here at LMG wear them all the time. Keep your feet dry for the future wet months, and save $25 by using offer code shortcircuit at Vessi.com/ShortCircuit. All right, let's power it on. Get the juice going. Whoa, Jono, you're doing it wrong, you gotta cable manage it better. You gotta do it around this side. - [Jono] No, I don't wanna do that side. - So it's got a bunch of pretty standard I/O, HDMI, oh man, okay, that's a little disappointing, it's got two HDMI 2.0s, a display port, probably just 1.4, and an audio jack. Anything else? Yeah, it's pretty bare bones. If you want something that just works, and does what you want it to do and you don't need a bunch of extra ports, that's when you get Acer. I think it's listed at 499.99, so for 390 hertz, that's not bad. For a 360 hertz monitor, that's about right. So, display settings, raising the display port, instead of HDMI, because it's only 2.0, it's not 2.1. What's the GPU we have in this PC? We got 3090, all right. What's the CPU? - [Jono] 5950. - Oh yeah, we're not gonna be bottlenecked by that, that's for sure. - [Jono] We might be thermal... - Yeah. Okay, so I mean yeah, I can enable G-Sync. FreeSync G-Sync are basically interchangeable at this point. 360 hertz, 1920 by 1080. Eight bit color, RGB, it's got okay color, not amazing. Oh, it's got speakers! Oh, yeah! Sometimes it's really handy to have speakers on monitors, and I actually really hate when they don't have it. For instance, it got crazy hot this summer, and so I moved my PC into my bedroom and everything, but my sound system is all wired into my desk. I still have sound, because my monitor has speakers. Is it good? No, it's garbage. But, at least I have it, right? I have something, so. Let's try to overclock it. Where are your controls? Show me your secrets. Yeah, these are always the worst, let me just control the little menu you have there. It's got one of these guys, that you would, like it has buttons, up down, left right, and press, so whenever there's a menu in there, just let me change it with this. Like, why do I still have to still touch these buttons, that I've gotta (indistinct) on the right one? Action, racing, sports, user, standard, eco, graphics. HDR. Oh, it's got HDR 400. Okay, where is the overclocking stuff? So brightness, contrast, black boost, blue light, ACM, apparently it's better contrast, I don't really notice the difference, I don't think it's all that much better. We're gonna turn it on. Oh, it's got an aim point thing, too? Oh yeah, that's great. So when I was a kid, we used to just actually put a dot in the center of our screen with a marker or something, or a Sharpie, for aim dots, basically. I'm not a cheater, I just use external things to my advantage, when I have access to them. Yeah, I'm a cheater, I'm a cheater. Oh, there it is. It's in system. They should really put it in gaming. I don't know why else you're gonna use overclock, except for gaming, really. Come on, 390. 60? Well, hold on, we probably have to... 390, hey, .297. That's higher than advertised, ever so slightly. Let's see if we can get Counter-Strike going, and use a scout, 'cause real men scout. (laughs) Tried and trusted Counter-Strike, right? Like I've been playing CS since Half-Life 1 days, with 1.6 and stuff. Ooh, that crisp audio. Oh, 1.3? Oh my god, Jono. Oh my god. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, (boat horn blows). See? The aim dot's already coming in. We're not even maxing this out. 350, 345, with minimums of, our 99 is at 180. So you know what, I'm actually gonna crank this way down. Very low. Hell yeah. I don't want official matchmaking, I wanna practice with bots, and you know what? I hate Dust II, I've played this map way too much. I'm so sick of it, I don't care. Mirage is better, but what I really want is Office, I love Office, I love hostages. I love hostages, okay? I'm so sick of Dust II bomb defusal. It gets, I mean I'm hitting 375 there, for the max 382. Like, that's the problem is, we're really not even utilizing this monitor to its full potential, right? Like yeah, it's over 360 sometimes, but I mean a lot of times 350, 340, and this is Office, there's not a whole lot going on in this map, it's not very big. So yeah, we'll go to Dust, maybe Office was a bad idea. Oh, I love Dust 1. I love Dust 1. I don't know what it is about it, it's not even the best map ever. Italy, Italy is another real classic, though. I love Italy, yeah. So yeah, I mean we're not hitting our max frame rates, and you know what, the thing is, is you could always buy this thing, and then hope that a new GPU comes out later. 'Cause I mean the reality is, how many of you really have a 3090, and a 5950X anyway? Like, this is pure esports territory. I mean, I personally play Counter-Strike and Valorant at 1440p, 144 hertz, and it is so much better. Ooh, 390! I hit 394 for just a second. Oh yeah. This looks good. Nothing's really smearing, you move, and it all, I mean it's blurry when you're moving it, because you can't see that fast anyway, but, as soon as it stops and settles, there's no really bad smear on any of the lines, any of those thin lines. I don't think our frame rate matters too much, depending on the settings, so let's turn it up to max, and see what it looks like. I, oh wow, it crashed, what the hell? Okay. This is about as small as I would personally go for a desktop monitor, about 24, 25 inches. It's on the cusp, and that's okay. \"Ministere des antiquites.\" Oh, we're blowing up antiques? I didn't even know that you're blowing up antiques in Dust II. Yeah, it's great, I don't notice anything. It's just crystal clear. Even look at this wall texture, oh, that looks so good. And this is 1080p, but on a small screen like this, 1080p is perfectly fine. Switch to bonus weapon. Oh, the Dual Berettas. The worst gun in the game. Dualies were great when they first came out, you're like \"Oh, this is so cool, I got two guns, and 30 bullets, how could it go wrong?\" And then you shoot, and you hit nothing, and it goes really wrong. Yeah, so there's hardly any smearing, it looks really good, you can zip around as much as you want, do a quick 180 or whatever, oh. Yes, even a chicken (indistinct) three shots with the dualies. Oh yeah, look at these shadows. They look great. There's no tearing. I'm at an angle, so it's kinda hard to tell, but yeah, there's like nothing. I don't understand people who need maybe 360, but I now want to upgrade from 120, 144, to like 240. Oh, yeah. Oh, god, it is smooth. Yeah, look at it, it's just crystal clear. Yeah, so I mean if you look at this bottom guy, 100 FPS, it's just blurry, it's unintelligible. I mean you can read it, but I mean, look how just gross the alien looks. The dots on the ship, you can hardly make it out, it looks like a single line. This is what I'm talking about, I wanna go up to 244 on my own home monitor, I need to make an upgrade at some point, because there's not a huge difference going from 200 to 390. Like, there is, it's there, the dots are clearer, but really, this difference here, huge. This difference here, not so huge. If I was a professional esports player, I would need this. You want every advantage you can get, it's the same thing as playing football without cleats. Like, why would you do that? But for casual gaming, even if you're just someone who thinks you wanna get into esports, it's a really big diminishing return. You're better off spending it on a nicer keyboard, or a better chair, a better mouse, or just a better computer in general, you know? Because if you were to basically analyze your kill ratio in games, I guarantee you the difference in the amount of kills that you're gonna get is so minimal. You're gonna get like one extra kill every 400 kills, or something like that. Is that really worth your, I don't know, extra two or 300 dollars? For me, it's not. The one nice thing is that, Acer products do tend to cost a little less, so if you do need the absolute best of the best, it's a good value for what they're offering. I just think that maybe unless you're a top rated esports player, you can spend your money a little better elsewhere. Maybe get a bigger display, maybe go 1440p, maybe go 4k. So thanks for watching, this is the Nitro XV2. If you like this video, maybe check out some of our other videos, Linus unboxed the G7 just the other day, and that thing is a killer monitor.",

    "transcript": "- It is here, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+. This phone I was on the fence about getting, because I have the Samsung S10+ and it's a perfect phone. I definitely don't need this, but this aura color is so incredibly beautiful, I just knew that this phone had my name on it. Mine is currently in the mail, but a huge thank you to Casey Neistat for letting me borrow his phone to make this video. He now lives in Los Angeles, and we made this crazy deal on the side of the road. I pulled up, he handed me the phone, he sped away, it felt like we were doing something wrong. I'm sure you guys all know Casey, but if you don't, make sure you go check out his YouTube channel. I'll put links in the description. I'm not even currently able to take advantage of the 5G speeds that this has, but that is something that I'm super excited to test out, and my sister has Verizon, so I'm gonna give her this for a while to test out the 5G, and she can report back for us. It is the Note, so obviously it comes with the S Pen, and what's cool about this is the S Pen now has some really cool gestures, so when you're inside of the camera app, you can do thing like this. Of course, the S Pen is great for taking notes or doodling, but I'm pretty sure that's mostly what I'm gonna use it for. I'm just looking at these colors, and it's hypnotizing. (dramatic choral music) This is the Note 10+ 5G version. It has an IP68 water resistance, which means you can submerge it in water for 30 minutes, up to 1.5 meters. It has a 6.8 inch AMOLED display, 256 gigs of storage with 12 gigs of RAM, which you could also expand with an SD card up to one terabyte. The rear camera has three different lenses, wide, telephoto and ultra-wide cameras, much like the S10. The front-facing camera is just this single hole-punch design, which I actually really like. This is 10 megapixel wide-angle. It'll shoot 2160 at 30 frames a second. But the biggest thing of all in the Note 10+ is, it doesn't have a headphone jack. Why am I laughing? Because I haven't had a headphone jack for years. I haven't even thought about a headphone jack, like, it is something that I don't even care about any more, and everyone's all up in arms and fussing that the Note 10+ does not have a headphone jack! Get over it. We're over it, over here, us iPhone people. You'll be fine. If you need any help, or suggestions on how to get through this difficult time, I'm here for you. Just Tweet me. It's weird, 'cause I also remember Samsung making fun of Apple for removing the headphone jack. I think it's great, I think you're brave, Samsung. Very, very brave. One of the main things that I love about Samsung Galaxy phones is the camera, and any time I get a new phone, one of the things that I have to test out first is the photos and the video. (mellow music) Testing out the front-facing video on the Note 10+. Here we are, we're doing it. Doing it! Wide-angle, regular. - This is my stance. - Zoom, the stance! Let's get that wide-angle so we can really get that, I mean, that's a stance. Hi, Matty. Matty, you're such a good model! Wide-angle Matty. Zoomed-in Matty. So right now, Tyler, we got regular? Is this regular? Okay, so what's it look like zoomed in? I don't know what it looks like, but I already know it's probably pretty close, like probably way too close for comfort. And then we have wide-angle. Another thing I wanna test out now is the live focus video. Oh, man, what's it look like? Does it look good? So this, you can't switch lenses, it's basically just what you got. Maybe we move around a little, see how it reacts. How's it reacting, is it a nice reaction? - [Cameraman] There's like a halo of not out-of-focus around you, a little bit. - Here's what I'm thinking, I think it'll adjust it once we hit save. So, let's see. - [Cameraman] They're seeing it. - Oh, they are seeing it, oh, but we'll see it. (both laugh) It looks a little better once you save it and re-watch it, but there definitely is still like, that little halo effect. This is also kind of a difficult background for it to adjust to, but all things considered, I think it looks cool. I probably won't be using that very often, just to say it. So now we're gonna head to an adoption center. Jenna is there volunteering, so maybe we'll see some puppies there that you guys can adopt! I'll put a link also in the description to the adoption center if you're interested. We're here at the adoption place, and Jenna's already here. Oh, my God, she has a puppy! (calm, twinkling music) Thank you guys for watching, this was just a quick look at the new Note 10+. This phone is really beautiful, even though I'm a huge iPhone fan, I've always been such a huge fan of the Galaxy phones. So look for more content featuring this phone soon, and I will see you guys in my next video! Don't forget to subscribe and like this video, hit the bell and do all of the things that YouTubers tell you guys to do at the end of their videos. Bye.",

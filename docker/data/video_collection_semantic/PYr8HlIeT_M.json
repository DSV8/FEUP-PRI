    "transcript": "like here it's the carpet man guys we just came to Corsair welcome to our CES 2020 tour I am Demetri and I will not forget our sponsors this time huge thanks to Phanteks thermaltake be quiet and razer for making our ces 2020 trip possible alright so the first thing we're gonna check out here at Corsair is something that Corsair calls concept Orion Orion damnit the Oreo cookie right here concept Orion so in front of me here is a Corsair 465X enclosure with as you can see this beautiful light show these capellix LEDs that have been installed here and this is just a little showcase to see what is going to be possible in the future so if you guys recall Corsair release capellix LEDs and these are really tiny LEDs that are super bright they have extremely high density of the LEDs and each individual capellix LED is addressable it can be controlled through the software and they have applied it on a film that goes on top of this tempered glass and since it has this beautiful lamination it shines in a 360-degree view so not only is your shining towards you so you can see them but it's also shining inside the case so actually does have this beautiful illumination on the inside as well well the showcasing here is 150 LEDs that applied in total this is something that actually will be rolling out in 2020 really excited to see how Corsair does the implementation that is retail and not just in this constant format because you can do all types of cool things in terms of lighting effects through IQ of course so everything will be connected and you can customize lighting not just on the interior of the case using fans and LED strips but this is a really really interesting and unique way to customize the actual exterior Wow ok that's beautiful oh we will get to the new air cooler from Corsair as Eber is preparing some sexy b-roll I want to first talk to you guys about the new k95 platinum XT keyboard when we first arrived here I was like no I don't really want to cover it but there are actually a few important differences that come with the new platinum XT so you guys know course here owns el gato and what they when the XD keyboard is actually integrated a legato functionality onto the G Keys they do come with extra set of key caps that they call the S keys that are blue therefore if you do pre program those G keys to something else that you do on the stream deck therefore you have that visual indicator on the actual keyboard as well this is the first time Corsa is rolling out black pbt key caps they have had white PV T key caps on their previous models they are live a little bit more coarse I'm not a huge fan of the actual font like there's some inconsistencies and the thickness of like certain letters the price is the same $199 as the original k95 platinum and this whole backwards compatibility is a good thing because if you own the original king that if I platinum you still will be able to utilize the G keys for stream deck in case you use that functionality it still comes with a palm rest attaches to the bottom but the main difference are actually the switches so they're still using MX cherry but MX cherry has gone through a different manufacturing process with the new facility in Germany so instead of having our traditional 50 million keystrokes the new materials and the new manufacturing process gives us double that so a hundred million keystrokes on MX cherry red brown and speed switches and this is the first time they're actually incorporating blue switches on such a high end keyboard but the new process does not apply here still 50 million keystrokes and I find it really odd that people still want blue switches on something something like it but whatever stream that functionality on the G Keys $199 and the last piece of the puzzle is the actual stream that software so in the software itself you have the keyboard indicator you can just drag-and-drop certain functionalities on it with an OSD on screen display to give you a little visual to see what each of those s Keys does so guys I actually stopped by something really cool now if you recall in 2011 Corsair launched a very first air cooler and it was called the 850 now it's currently unavailable and they've been out of the air cooler game for a really long time but they're back in 2020 kicking things off with the a500 now this air cooler is actually designed to compete against the Noctua DH15 or the D15 as well as they'd be quiet dark Pro Series the beefier coolers that are available in the market right now and it's priced at 9 and dollars okay good that's good good now one of the interesting things about this cooler is that corsair actually did an anti Corsair move by not implementing any shape or form of RGB lighting which is actually pretty cool because this is just a standalone straight up air cooler with no lighting cables or anything that you have to worry about is simply a simple installation plug in your fan headers or your fan cables and you're good to go now in terms of compatibility what the a500 supports both Intel and aim for platforms unfortunately no threaded for support so if you are looking for a Corsair cooler you might as well just get an air cooler or an Holden would look at cooler for threaded for solutions TDP is rated for 250 watts which is kind of on because threaded / CPUs are well under that range so yeah what's a little assistance what are you doing here alright so check this out this is the most interesting thing about the a500 and it's a whole installation process now every single time when I'm working with either not to a cooler or be quiet cooler I end up cutting my fingers just because when I'm installing fans on both sides the fins just in contact with my skin I end up like with a lot of cuts which definitely is frustrating so what Corsair did is they I've actually implemented something called a slide and fan mount mechanism so essentially you can just use a slide and type and slide those two fans easily and each fan brackets do come with 12 step increments so what happens is if you have a memory module that's slightly higher you could use these fan markets to offset and that way it'll be easily compatible with say I don't know if it's a g.skill memory kit or a corsair dominator memory kit now the included fans are these standard ml 120 Mangala fans they're not 140 millimeters which is an interesting choice because that makes sense because the fan bracket does take a lot of space which is why they had to accommodate a 120 min or a fan compared to whatnot - it does with the D 15 that offers 140 millimeter fan configurations you could also swap these fans with your fans of choice and yeah it just uses a standard screwin mechanism just like that so the included backplate is made out of steel with rubber padding once you have the backplate on you just have to install the retention brackets it's very similar to what you could do with a knot to a cooler and what happens is if you want to install or secure those two attention brackets you just remove this top front mesh design that's completely made out of an aluminum Corsair also does include a screwdriver so if you want a Corsair screwdriver this is a great way to get your hands on one so overall installation seems very straightforward really good job Corsair now out of the box Corsair does apply a pre-tournament solution on the base and they also include a high-performance XDM 50 thermal compound now let's quickly talk about the heat pipe configuration Corsair decided to stick with four on each side so six millimeters on the outside eight millimeters on the inside and they did this to make it a lot more efficient when it comes to cooling now from what I've been told performance is actually just on par with what you get with non troppo as well as be quite cooler so I'm really curious to test out the performance of this cooler the a500 from Corsair in specific let me know what you guys think in the comments that's it so so the included back so the included backplate is so all right so that is all from Corsair thanks much for watching do you guys want us through you that keyboards I know Eva was excited about it will definitely be reviewing that cooler it looks pretty awesome although it's quite beefy but thanks so much for watching make sure to check out with other CES content I'll see you guys in next",

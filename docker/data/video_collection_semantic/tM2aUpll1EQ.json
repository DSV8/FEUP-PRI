    "transcript": "- This video is part of my Wireshark Packet Analysis and Ethical Hacking Course. Have a look at this playlist if you wanna see other videos in this course. In this video, I'm gonna show you how to use Wireshark filters. Okay, let's get started. (upbeat music) Here's Wireshark and as you can see there's quite a lot of traffic on my Ethernet zero interface on my computer. I'm gonna go to Capture, Options. I'm gonna select the card that I'm going to capture traffic on. This is capturing traffic on my live network, there's a lot of traffic on this network. But what I'm gonna do here specify TCP port 23. So I'm filtering traffic going to TCP port 23. That's all I'm gonna capture. I'm not capturing anything else. So even though Wireshark is capturing, I'm not seeing anything. That's very different, for instance to, capturing all traffic on the network. What I'll do now is Telnet to a live router. This is a live router in my network. And notice suddenly you can see traffic in Wireshark. I can see that Telnet traffic is being captured. What I'll do is enter a username of let's say Wireshark and enter the password, and notice I've connected to the router, show version, shows me the version of router. Just make that bigger. And if you missed that, 'cause it was off screen. Let me do that, show you that again. So username, password, all on top of the show version, and I see the version of operating system and other information on this router, this is a physical router in my network. So back in Wireshark, all I captured was that Telnet traffic, basically TCP port 23. I didn't capture any other traffic. So I could, as an example, right click, click, follow TCP stream, and notice I'll see all the information. Here's the username, which is Wireshark. Notice we've got red and blues. So we see the traffic going to the router and the traffic echoed back. So Wireshark as the username. Here's the password, which is \"badpassword,\" you shouldn't use that. Here's show version again, command center, the router echoed back. So we see sshh vveerr, will show version, and here's all the output echoed back to me from that show command. So again, the advantage of doing this is I'm not capturing all traffic on the network. I'll stop that capture, and I'll simply save it as Telnet, Capture. Again, if I went to capture options, if I didn't specify this, so let's say I removed that and captured all traffic. I'll see all kinds of traffic on the network, not just Telnet traffic. You can see UDP traffic here, you can see Dropbox, LAN sync Discovery Protocol. Here's MDNS Multicast Domain Name System. There's a bunch of broadcasts here from a Cisco device. We've got Link Layer Discovery Protocol messages being sent on the network, IGMP version to DNS, all kinds of traffic is being captured. And depending on how busy your network is, your capture file is going to get very, very big. So when capturing traffic on a live network or a network with a lot of traffic, remember you can select your interface and then select a filter. The advantage here is, you only capture specific traffic types. The disadvantage is you also only capture specific traffic types so that's all you gonna see. You're not gonna be able to filter on other traffic in a lot of the examples I'm using display filters. So I'm capturing all the traffic and then just filtering on specific traffic types. That allows me to filter on OP or ICMP or other traffic types. Here, I can only see the traffic that I've selected in the filter, but the advantage here is my file doesn't get huge. So I can limit the amount of traffic that I'm filtering. Okay, so in summary, just remember that Wireshark has two ways that you can filter. So two filtering languages you can filter while capturing traffic, or you can filter once you've captured all traffic types and then just use a display filter. There are advantages and disadvantages to both again. Advantage of filtering when you capture, is you reduce your capture packet size. (upbeat music)",

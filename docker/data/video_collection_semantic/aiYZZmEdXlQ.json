    "transcript": "[Lew] Face towards the product eyes, towards the lens. Okay, what do you do mouth closed yeah? How do you do it, how do you express shock without the mouth being closed? I feel like I'm constipated This is harder than it looks Okay, I'm just gonna do it because that's what we do here Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here. And I normally don't unbox things, but I'm in environments where things are unboxed Unboxy place okay iPhone 10 I did not want to do a video in these things because I want to experience these products like a consumer It's some serious stuff But here I am unboxing these things for the world's worst iPhone 10 unboxing. Okay. I'm just gonna crack these open and See what is up, so I actually haven't seen a single video on these things sorry Jon, sorry Lou but I Wanted to see right. I'm excited about these phones These are one of the first proper products have been like amped about since I started doing YouTube. That's the thing as a youtuber You get a lot of stuff and it's cool to get cool things But you lose that that connection with a new product the new toy that comes in you just you lose that That joy that comes with it, and I wanted to feel it again with the item content, so here. We are Space Gray black whatever they call it and white or silver now the phone I'm using right now is the essential phone and I'm a huge soccer for this phone because of the screen the Somewhat bezel was screen and Really Yeah, but there's gotta be phones that are like like those like those like Asian was like dude II know What's this one iPhone 10 Cool So how good is that unboxing you guys want to see more of this on my channel?

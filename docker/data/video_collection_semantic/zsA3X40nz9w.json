    "transcript": "If you were a kid some time before, say, 2010, there was a phrase your parents probably learned to be quite irritated by: batteries not included. Our gadgets and gizmos used to be quite reliant on the good ol AA battery or, if designerswanted to be annoying, the AAA battery. Look, theres not a huge difference in size between the AA and the AAA and they usually cost the same per battery so whenever some engineer outthere decides that a thing which could clearly fit longer-lasting AA batteries in it will go withjust as expensive but shorter-lived AAAs instead, I get a wee bit angry. I mean, just look at thisremote control. It could totally fit AAs in there, just look at how much extra room th - wait is that a Duracell PowerCheck? Indeed it is! If you were buying batteries inthe late 90s, you probably remember these. The idea was that rather than need to use some sort of battery tester to see if a battery still had any charge left in it, you could build that tester intothe battery. And thats what Duracell did - as well as some of their competitors. As a matter of fact this versionof the idea came from Kodak, and theres a whole fascinating story around patent disputeswhich I wont be getting into (long story short, James R. Burroughs had a similar but technicallydifferent idea slightly earlier than Kodak but both patents got approved which caused some kerfuffles- Ive linked to a great article down below which explains all that). Here, I just wantto focus on how the Duracell version worked, because its quite clever! But also muchmuch simpler than you might have imagined. If you want to test a battery like this, youregoing to want to measure its voltage. Like most battery chemistries, ordinary alkaline manganesedioxide cells experience a drop in voltage asthey discharge. When fresh each cell has a voltagearound 1.5, maybe 1.6 volts (and the standard AA, AAA, C, and D batteries are composed of just asingle cell, like an amoeba!). But that voltage steadily diminishes as the battery is usedup. When youre halfway through itll be down to around 1.2 volts and when its near emptyitll struggle to produce even a single volt. So, a quick check of a battery can be donewith a multimeter like this one. If I use it and probe across this battery here, it's reading 1.57 volts so this is eitherbrand new or hardly used. This one, though, it's only reading 1.06 soits pretty dead. This test isnt perfect because were not checking the batteries under aload, but its still fairly reliable. Trouble is, you need a multimeter to do this as well as the knowledge of how much voltage drop is acceptable before it's dead. So lots of inexpensive battery testers were made which are really just analog voltmeters with ascale that reads good and bad. But what if youcould build a voltmeter into the battery itself? Well, thats ultimately what Duracell did with thesebatteries, but the way they work is a little odd. First, youll notice that the batterysays to test it at 70 degrees Fahrenheit or 21 degrees Celsius. That probablymeans the testers functionality has something to do with temperature, and indeedit does. But before I get ahead of myself, let me just show you how these were used. It says press dots to test and, well, thats all you had to do. Except if you rememberthese youll know that you had to press quite hard. Dig your nails in there a little bit. Onceyou did it though, the little bar below the power gauge would suddenly turn yellow, filling up fromright to left. If the whole bar turned yellow, the battery was full. And less and less of itwould turn yellow as the battery wore down. Now, with a use by date of March 2003 itprobably wont surprise you to learn that these batteries are in fact very dead. I got thetester to turn yellow with a little movie magic involving a foot switch and a hair dryer. Because heat is what turns that little bar yellow. Behind that little window is a smallamount of thermochromic material, which as the name implies changes color based on temperature. Its the same sort of stuff that goes in a mood ring or one of those thermometers you might stickon an aquarium. The specific chemical in here is simpler - it merely indicates its above a certaintemperature threshold, but its the same general idea. What makes it heat up, though? Well you may havenoticed that the testing window is perfectly in-line with the two dots youre supposed topress to test the battery. The tester is built into the batterys label, which Ive removed fromthis one. In case youve never seen an unwrapped alkaline battery before, well this is what theylook like. The positive terminal is actually part of the batterys shell, and it extends almostall the way down to the negative terminal. A small insulator separates the negative tab fromthe shell. And if we compare with one of the still-wrapped batteries, well see that one ofthe testing dots rests on the negative terminal and the other rests on the batterys shell (which, remember is the positive terminal of the battery). Looking now at the backside of the label, wellsee that those testing dots are above electrically conductive pads. The pads on the negative sideare very difficult to see, theyre these three grey patches which dont look all that impressive, but the positive contact patch is quite obviously a metal foil of some sort. And the contact patchsits behind a round hole in a thin piece of beige insulating material. That insulating layer keepsthe pad from touching the battery shell unless you actively press on the label and force itthrough. If you exert enough force on both dots for their respective contact patches to touchboth ends of the battery, you complete a circuit. To what, you ask? A tiny little heater. Thatheater is in contact with the thermochromic material, so if the battery has sufficient charge, when you press in those dots and complete the circuit, the heater will warm up the indicatorand turn it yellow. But its not quite that simple. While you could just use a very thin wire heatingelement, that would only allow for a simple pass/fail test. If the battery had enough oomph left to produce enough heat to make the indicator yellow, great! But you wouldnt necessarily knowhow much oomph it had left. So instead, the heater has a varying cross-sectional area to producea gradient of heat output across its length. If I remove that paper insulator, we can actuallysee the heater. Kind of, anyway. Im not sure exactly what its made of - it might actually just be the samefoil that makes up the contact patch. Regardless, it is visible and youll notice that it hasa slight taper, becoming narrower towards the negative end of the battery. That means itsresistance actually varies across its length, which also means the voltage drop across each partof this heater when its operating is different. If the battery is strong enough, its voltage willbe sufficient to heat the entire thing, so all ofthe indicator turns yellow. But if the batteryis getting weak and voltage begins to fall, then only the skinny, high-resistance part ofthe heater will get warm. Most of the voltage drop occurs in that part of the heater, andthe battery doesnt have any more volts for the rest of it, so only that part getswarm enough to turn the indicator yellow. And luckily I can show you this with a DC powersupply. When I provide this with just 1 volt, youll see that only the right side ofthe graphic turns yellow. To clarify, the indicator always turns yellow at the sametemperature, and the entire bar is filled withthe same indicator. But low voltages (caused bya weak battery) can only get the skinny part of the heater warm enough to actually change theindicators color. But when I crank the voltage up, now all of it gets warm and so the whole barturns yellow. And of course the bar is aligned with the zero to 100% scale to give a reasonablyaccurate impression of the batterys useful liferemaining. Its a very elegant solution usingtech so simple that it can be printed on a label. Oh, and remember that beige insulator? Turnsout its not just electrically insulating, its also thermally insulating. That slot cutinto it is there to maintain an air gap between the heater and thermochromic material and thebattery shell. The battery shell is made of thermally-conductive material and its rathermassive, so if the tester were in physical contact with the battery shell, it would suck all theheat right out of it and it would never turn the indicator yellow. Keeping it away from the batteryis necessary for the indicator to function, so the same piece of whats essentially justpaper is functioning as both a crude power switch for the tester and thermalisolation for the indicator. Neat. You might have realized that since the battery is powering a heater to test itself, that means each time you test it youre usingup a little bit of its capacity. And this is true - though it also means the test is slightly more accurate since youre doing it under a load. Its not like the actual scale here is all that accurate but testing under load is critical. These 25 year old batteries test at about 1.3 voltson the multimeter, which would suggest theyve got about half their capacity remaining. But theirability to produce any current flow is completely shot. If I manage to activate the tester whilealso probing the battery, youll see that the voltage plummets to not even half a volt as theheater is placed in-circuit. So, sure enough, these batteries are dead and their inbuilttester does actually reflect that. Yet the multimeter doesnt. So then why did it go away? Duracell PowerCheck wasa pretty short blip on the landscape of disposable batteries yet its clearlya useful, functional feature. Well, the patent disputes and licensing shenanigans are one clear reason but I honestly think theres a simpler one: not that many people were actuallytesting their batteries on a regular basis! Yes, we all know about the loose batteries inthe junk drawer that may or may not save the TV remote in a trying time, but aside fromrandom situations like that, I think its fair to say most people used and continue to use batteries in a pretty straightforward way: they simply stay new in the package until they get put into a thing which needs batteries, and then they stay in that thing until they die, at which point theyre gotten rid of and another set of fresh batteries replacesthem. Id argue its pretty uncommon to take partially-used batteries out of a thing andthen put them in the junk drawer for later use. Im not saying I think that never happens - I myself have a few tools which need batteries but I dont keep batteries in them since I rarely use those tools. But I do think in the grand scheme, keeping half-used batteries around is infrequent. Certainly infrequent enough to question whether it actually makes sense to spend the money putting abattery tester on every single battery. These are commodity items, and while there surely is some brand loyalty out there for the most part theyrecompeting on cost, and so if you need a pack of batteries and you use them like I do, a built-in battery tester is just a weird gimmickwhich makes them more expensive (and makes me less likely to buy it). And as I already said, if you remember these, they werent easy to use! It was actually quite frustrating to jam those dots in there and hope it turned yellow. And if I were the type of person who kept partially-used batteries in random places, I wouldprobably just buy a battery tester and keep it around. Or, ya know, just try putting them in whatever needs batteries and see if they work. That was always an option. I think that in hindsight, this is apretty clear case of a really clever, and very neat idea which was unfortunatelyborn from a very particular frustration. A frustration that the inventors thought was more common than it actually was. Duracell used to include inexpensive batterytesters in the packages of their batteries, and they worked very similarly to the PowerCheckfeature here. Some people found them hard to use, or were bothered by the fact that they wereeasy to lose, and that could be seen as a legitimate problem to solve. Which Duracelldid by incorporating those testers into the battery! But I dont think anyone asked how often those testers were actually getting used in the first place. Because if they had, Imnot sure this would have ever happened. Of course these days, most of our devices whichneed batteries are using rechargeable batteries, so were just not buying or using disposable batteries asmuch as we used to. Which I think is unequivocally a good thing! Its kinda nuts how normal it usedto be to burn through these and then just throw em away. I had a Game Boy and that one device must have gone through dozens of these. And then there was the Walkman, my camera, the light forthe game boy, and who knows how many other toys I had which needed constant battery replenishment. Thank goodness were past that. Mostly. Uh, but even for the devices on sale today which needAA batteries? They often tell you how much charge is left so putting a tester on the batteryitself really just isnt necessary anymore. Alright, well I think were done. I wantto extend a thank you to Luis Solano for suggesting this video topic. Its been on the docket for a while but, uh, well these havent been in production for quite some time so it took me a while to get my hands on them. And I have a second thank you for ErnieSmith - this is at least the second time my research began and immediately I was presentedwith a thorough Tedium article. I would have gone more deeply here were it not for the fact that this video was originally slated for November but production issues on a differenttopic moved it up to now, so if youre interested in those patent details and some of thebackstory, be sure to check out the link in the description. Normally I try to put somethingclever here but I think Im all out of juice. exhaustedly smooth jazz like most battery chemistries, ordinary alkaline magaz magazine? Are you subscribed to Alkaline Magazine? Lots of inexpensive battery testers were made which are really just analog voltmeters with a scale that ride DANG IT Kind of. I'm not exactly... oh I don't like that delivery ...but there ability to produce any curr...mmmmnaAAGH ...plummets to not even half a volt as the plater... mehah huhhh It was actually kind of frustrating to push these dots in and wait for it to light up. And if I were the type of person who kept part- yep, I can't say \"light up\" I'll get pedanted for that. If I were the type of person who kept randomly used partially used aaaaahggghhh! So apparently these were made for much longer in some markets and also hung around for a while here in the US on some of the high-end batteries Duracell sold. TBH I had no idea but mostly because I'm a value-obsessed Midwesterner who mostly buys generics (or might splurge for Rayovac if it's on-sale). Does this count as an end-captions gag? You decide!",

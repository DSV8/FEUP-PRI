    "transcript": "if you're in the market for a gaming monitor there are two ways you can goabout it. the first boring way is head to whatever local reputable Hardware Source you have and buy a well-reviewed monitor or you can be a real badass who doesn't live by life's Petty reasonable rules and take your chances buying a random high-end gaming monitor from a brand you've never heard of before off AliExpress I wonder which one I went [Music] with [Music] the monitor in question is this Titan Army 27 in 1440p high refresh rate gaming monitor which uses a mini LED backlight something that I've wanted to try for ages considering it can reproduce the kind of brightness used to down commercial airliners and as you can tell by the writing on the box this is clearly not intended for the Canadian Market in terms of accessories we get this 150 W power brick with an adapter for us to use in the North American Market which is a really nice touch it's cool that they thought of that uh cuz this cable is for China some standoffs for Vasa mounting a display port and HDMI cable and this is a monitor calibration Factory report that looks like it was pulled out of my eighth grade school backpack I don't know what happened to it uh but it's cool that they include this cuz it shows that with the Adobe RGB space for example it's quite accurate although I will test it myself I'm not just going to take their word for it uh oh they did actually test for two other color spaces as well oh that is some Christmas doily quality plastic right [Music] there that is about as much IO as a non- psychopath would ever need I think these are HDMI 2.0 ports it's pretty [Music] good ooh so much staing now that looks exactly how I'd imagine a gaming monitor off of AliExpress would look it is real plasticky we've got some Titan Army font going on here I think from the listing it does say that some of this lights up around the back the stand adjustability is pretty good so you can kind of swivel it like that you can height select it I like that it's not super sturdy but you know it's it's it's a usable stand and you can go portrait with it but it's like barely tall enough to clear the stand you kind of have to turn it out to get it to swivel around but still that is a decent stand and little bit of C routing hole it does seem to have quite thin bezels and the Titan Army doesn't look great but you know it looks fine it's plain enough that I wouldn't be humiliated if the in-laws saw it the green and orange does bother me a bit though let me quickly see if I'm justified in my outrage over the color matching yeah I I'd say my outrage about the the color matching is Justified here with that vital bit of information covered let's power it up and see what it looks like ooh what a graphic wow this is already very bright I wonder what brightness setting this is at that looks like an old Alienware menu wao this is 50% brightness now while I struggled to navigate the OSD menus using the terrible little buttons on the bottom of the monitor let me tell you why I was so fascinated to try a mini LED gaming monitor now mini LED as the name suggests uses small LEDs behind the display to illuminate it which has the advantage of retina searing brightness this monitor in fact apparently has an HDR 1000 certification but considering that we're not at the point where mini LED backlights can have an LED per pixel we do run into some problems in fact this 27in display only has 384 zones of lighting which is a lot less than the millions of pixels that this display has now the reason this is potentially a problem is if you have a very bright thing and a very dark thing right next to each other sharing the same lighting Zone what does the backlight do then well struggle but struggle in an interesting way but let's see if the problem presents itself with the first gaming impression now this is Battlefield 5 running in HDR because you know HDR 1 million and all that uh it's something I've not seen before and well it it looks like Battlefield 5 the monitor now running at 144 HZ feels nice and Snappy it's a very responsive feeling monitor but there is some motion blur with fast movement it's not terrible by any stretch of the imagination but it's nowhere near the crystal smooth image of like the 240 HZ OLED algae panels but those do cost a lot more with Battlefield 5 I can't really see any kind of Bloom happening and that's with me specifically looking for it uh but there is a game that's a lot darker and more cont rasty than this which may have a problem with it so the void has descended around me now so we can more clearly tell kind of backlight performance and even in the very contrasty menus of escape from takov I'm struggling to see any halo around any of the the contrasty bits and I think the reason for that is because this monitor has pretty bad IPS glow which means that the black levels aren't really deep enough for me to see the haloing I think that's the problem here which is something that becomes clear when you start moving around the display off axis you can start to very clearly see that Halo show up which pretty much invalidates one of the other benefits of a mini LED backlight improved black levels because the backlight isn't the limiting factor here the IPS panel is in this configuration it just looks like a wildly bright IPS display which isn't a bad thing it measures very interestingly the measured contrast is crazy high for an IPS display despite everything I just said but to my eye the main benefit is the wild brightness and the max brightness is very impressive if a little redundant I did turn it down quite a bit cuz it was almost uncomfortably bright but then I decided to quite unfairly compare it to the OLED display that Corsair recently sent over which is unfair cuz that display is a lot more expensive who the first thing that I noticed aside from the inky black levels on the OLED is the OLED is so much less bright than that Titan Army I was just playing DOTA on that Titan Army Monitor and at 83% brightness it is way Brighter Than This OLED is at 100% brightness and a direct comparison between these two displays really puts into perspective how powerful that mini LED backlight is and I think even the factory color calibration is more accurate on our AliExpress special but because of the oled's lack of ips glow aside from just the significantly darker black levels and lack of backlight glow the image seems way clearer the Titan Army in comparison almost seems like it's got a grainy filter over the image but on that note I've gotten a bit carried away comparing mini LED and OLED Willie sizes the point of this video was um oh AliExpress gaming monitors now I'm actually very surprised by this Titan Army display from the sample size of one apparently you can get pretty good gaming displays on Ali Express although we do still need to discuss price which is a very interesting topic with this display I paid about 500 us for it which for a mini LED display is actually not that much money it's a very expensive technology but for a gaming display it is quite a lot of money and considering that this feels like a normal IPS display just on a bit of steroids in terms of brightness I feel like it's too much for what the monitor is but either way I was quite impressed with the display and it's really sold me on the value of insane Peak brightness that's something that OLED displays really need to figure out over the next coming years um yeah let me know in the comment section down below what you think of the display and I think that brings me to the end of the video thank you for watching until the next one bye-bye [Music] a",

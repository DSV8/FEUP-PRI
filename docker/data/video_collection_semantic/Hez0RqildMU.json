    "transcript": "So you guys know I've always got my finger on the pulse, I'm always looking for that next gadget, that thing you didn't know you wanted yet. So, when HP hit me up with their new \"Sprocket\" And they said \"Hey, Lew, we would love to sponsor an episode, \"we'd love to send you out our brand new device which takes digital content \"and allows it to exist in the real world.\" When you hit a button, and an actual image, a physical image that you could give to somebody prints out. Well, that's what this thing does, but in a kind of modern way. The Sprocket comes along with an app for iOS or Android which lets you take your images from your smartphone, social media and otherwise, and make a nice little 2x3 image from your smartphone. You understand what I'm saying? Now you can hand that to somebody and be like \"Hey! I wanna commemorate this moment in a real way, \"not a digital way.\" You want a physical representation. You want to upgrade your sentiment. So, how does it all work? How is it so small? What's going on here, Lew? Alright. This has 10 sheets included in the box. It uses no ink... It's got a brand new printing technology. From zinc. The printer. Look at how small that- That thing is tiny! That looks like a power switch, and on the top here we have a micro USB port. Here are the sheets of paper. Sprocket. There we go. I could picture, you know, the kids at high school, they got the binder, the notebook with the sticky images on the back. All those special moments. So, now we're connected via Bluetooth, so I'm gonna go ahead and launch the app, and what you'll notice is you have some options here: the ability to take a photo ...or select a photo from various social medias. So that's kinda cool, you can go back through your collection, and print stuff that's already up there. Since it's always a party here in the studio, what better thing to photograph than how much fun Jack is having? Say \"cheese\", Jack. 3, 2, 1... [camera shutter sound] Beautiful picture of Jack over here. A little editor that you can use to enhance your photo, put some text on top of it. Moment of truth: Ah! Load paper. Oh! You've got this important sheet here, and that's going to identify to the printer that it's now loaded up. First ever picture of Jack here, printed. \"Sending to printer.\" The smart sheet comes out first. Jack attack! It's you, man! [excited laughter] Look at Jack attack! Now, that is cool. And now that's a sticky back, so I can stick that to something to... just, remind myself of Jack. But what is actually more exciting to me, is the ability to print straight from social media. That's my Instagram right there. Now, I can select any image I want on here, maneuver it... Here we go again. Round 2. It's the racing simulator in real life right over here. They're like little trading cards, look at this! So basically you've got Instagram, Facebook, Flickr, and then your own camera roll, so you can select from any of those. There's some filters in here, so let's- let's give it that hue right there. Alright, we'll put that filter on. We're gonna put the old-school Polaroid-type frame on there. That's like some shades on top of shades action right there. That's the thug life shades, that's the diamond goatee. You could put some text as well, anywhere you want. \"Deal with it.\" It's like a mini little Photoshop in here! [laughing] This is 1/1. Limited edition. It's probably worth like a m- million dollars at least? Ooh, that's artistic. Look at that right there! That's special. By zinc. Zero ink. An HP Sprocket. Alright, leave a thumbs up down below if you want me to give this away to somebody. One of a kind, like I said, it's at least a billion dollars. And that's today. Think about like a decade from now.",

    "transcript": "My wife cuts my hair! It looks like a comet is literally about to hit earth but it might be a good thing. I'm talking about Intel's new Comet Lake Desktop processors Which are not hinting literally anything. We've been anticipating this for quite a while and now we finally have a reported release date. According to the report, they'll be unveiled on April 30th so you won't have to wait too much longer for the newest batch of silicon from team blue. Yeah. The top end Core i9 processes will feature up to 10 cores and 20 threads but even the mid-range hexa-core Core i5's will now feature hyper-threading, a first for the Core i5 line. Let's hear it for the Core. - [Person In Background] Yeah nice one! - They grow up so slow, so while this new line up will add a little more value. Were hoping we will be able to actually get our hands on them as production may be affected by the epidemic. Maybe the virus knows were trying to beat it using folding at home. - [Guy In Background] We'll get ya! - Were also getting a new mid range graphics card very soon. Although the GPU itself GTX 1650 is nothing new, there is variant with four gigabytes of GDR6 memory. Where as the previous version had the same amount of the slower GDR5 memory. The increased speed means that the card will probably be able to pull assets. From the be around faster which could translate to higher performance depending on the game. Though it should noted that the move is primarily happening because manufactures are running out of GDR5. But regardless several AIV partners including Asus, MSI, Gigabyte, and EVG are releasing cards featuring the new GPU. Which should be going for around a hundred and sixty dollars so it could be a interesting choice if you don't quite have the dough to step up to one of the GTX60 variants. At least GTX50 is a impressing sounding number. - [ Man in Background ] What's? Wait what's impressive about it? It's right in the middle. - And a new kind of memory is on its way as well. All sorts of type of crazy stuff, a major ram manufacturer known as Hynix has announced it's going to start a large skill production of ten nanometer DDR5 this year. We are verified baby, by next year the company believes DDR5 will make over one-fifth of the worlds DRAM market, as if. It's not going to beat anything out. Better power efficiency will be a major selling point. For DDR5 as well as running and owning a 1.1 volt which is fewer volts than DDR4 and stick will come with error correct abilities. No more dumb I made a mistake? I didn't know that. (laughs) We should also get higher memory density meaning larger capacities per module as well as faster speeds with forty-eight hundred megahertz which is suspected to be a common offering for consumers, and that's in the spec. - [Guy In Background] Wow no over clocking! - That sounds like great news! For battery conscious mobile users as well as streamers who are constantly running out of memory because they spend too much money in RGB instead. - [Guy In Background] How was I supposed to know that? - And all you poor fools who use chrome with lots of tabs. Today's quick bits are provided to you by Private Internet Access VPN which lets you mask your IP and encrypt your traffic. PIA offers over 3300 servers in 30 countries and no ban with caps it has configurable encryption levels and a kill switch to keep you in control and with combined with private browsing it can make websites think your are in a different country, you can connect up to five devices at once whether they be Windows, Mac, Android, IOS or Linux and PIA mace feature blocks malware and tracking domains, try at the link below with a 30 day money back guarantee. Now its time for the quick bits. - [Guy In Background] Wow, beautiful! - Chrome is in no danger of losing its status of the worlds most popular browser but we have a new silver melodist, Microsoft Edge beating out Firefox, they edged him out. Edge has 7.6 percent of the market as apposed to Firefoxs 7.2 percent. In your face (inaudible) - [Guy In Background] No! - I mean that's what I imagine Microsoft is saying right now. - [Guy In Background] Firefox is better though! - I agree. There have been a lot of YouTube videos spreading a lot of conspiracy saying that coronavirus is somehow linked to 5G. And after 5G towers in he UK have been attacked by arsonist, thanks to these rumors. YouTube is saying enough and banning such videos. Though other kinds of conspiracy videos concerning 5G will be allowed to remain. I wonder if we can say 5G is responsible for all the weird stuff Joe Exonic did. - [Guy In Background] Probably! He's my tiger king! - A few leaks all but confirmed the new iPhone SE is on its way. It's going to be slightly larger than the original with a 4.7 inch screen, but don't let the relatively small size fool you. That's why you bought one to begin with. It's inspected to have very quick A13 system on a chip so it shouldn't be much slower than the big boys. However the name is simply going to be the iPhone SE. With 2020 in the parentheses. I really hope they print that on the phone. Its kinda strange coming from a company obsessed with designs. I doubt that. Mac users should make sure their system is up to date as a security in the safari browser is opening up apple systems having their cameras and microphones spied on. Yes, they are better looking than PC people. All the attacker has to do is get the victim to click on a link that loads a malicious script and with tons of people working from home clicking on stuff because of the pandemic. I really don't think you want god knows who finding out you are working in your underwear. - [Guy In The Background]: Wait you are at home? - And you have a stallion desk and your camera is under your desk? What? At Ittstore.com and you know how system requirements are often really inaccurate? Well turns out its also true for running windows. As a twitter user recently got windows 10 on only at a a hundred and ninety-two megabytes of ram. Far below of the listed one gigabyte bare minimum. Mind you we don't know if you can really do much on that much of memory, but the user at least got windows up and running. Um, that's it I guess you can look at the cool rotating wallpapers on the sign in screen? Maybe there's a reason why the spec is what it is. And you don't need us, at least not today so you can shut your computer down for now, but come back on Wednesday for more tech news. You got nothing else to do right? What are you gonna do gonna go outside? Walk your dog with a really long leash? You can't get close to dogs. - [Man In Background] (inaudible) - With your own dog you live with? Two meters. - [Man In Background] I'm going to stay away from all dogs. - I have my dog behind glass I just pet the glass. - [Man In Background] (laughs) It cries all day.",

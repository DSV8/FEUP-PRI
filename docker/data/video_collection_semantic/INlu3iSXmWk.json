    "transcript": "(Upbeat Music) - This is the iPad mini, it's the 2021 edition that brings it up to date with the iPad pro and iPad air's design language. Also, it comes in purple, which is very nice. If you think of this as just a big iPad, but shrunk down, it's that, but it's not that. If you think it's just a big iPhone blown up just a little bit bigger, it's also that, but really it's not that either. It's the middle child of the iOS lineup, between the iPhones and the big iPads. I am also a middle child, and so, this review metaphor could get really weird, but we're not going to let that happen. Let me just tell you why this middle child is good, even though it has a bit of an identity crisis, the iPad mini I mean not, not me. No, I'm fine. Don't cut the title. This isn't about me. Okay, So let's get started talking about the iPad mini by saying that it has a larger 8.3 inch display inside this aluminum shell. That's really, very nice. It's got flat sides and excellent build quality. The bezels around this display, they seem big, but they're really not that egregious. And it is a place to rest your thumbs when you're holding it, I guess. Anyway, I think making the bezel smaller would probably involve using technology that would rapidly increase the cost. And the cost, well, it doesn't really need any increases. This thing starts at $4.99 for a 64 gigabyte model, which is not a very generous amount of storage. Your only other option is 256 gigs, which costs $650. You can also get a 5G version of this little tablet, but, FYI doesn't support millimeter wave, which is not really a big loss, in my opinion. It's hard for me to say if those prices are worth it, and iPad air is only a hundred bucks more and it has a much bigger screen. And you know, of course, most iPhones cost a lot more. And what you're getting here is the same as the top of the line processor on the newest iPhone 13 pro. So the pricing thing is a little complicated. To me, the answer to the price question is, do you know exactly what you want out of a smaller iPad? There are some easy answers for some people. For me, I like having it as a chill, content consumption device. I love this thing for reading and games. It's actually, it's great for games and man, boy, oh boy, do I wish I could install some game streaming apps on this, instead of depending on the web to stream games or, you know, play Fortnite. But I do think it's not fair to think of this just as a content consumption device. It limits what you can pull off with this iPad. For example, if you could find a decent Bluetooth keyboard and stand, and you don't really, that's weirdly hard to do right now, I've been looking and I don't really like any of them. There is this one from Logitech, which is pretty okay. But anyway, if you can find one, then this can do anything that a big iPad can do. There is no smart connector here for keyboards, of course, but, as a tiny little work machine, it actually kind of works. But works is relative. The smaller screen means that the on-screen keyboard here, especially when you're in landscape mode, it covers well like, the whole screen practically. The dock also gets weird when you're in portrait mode, sometimes you feel like you have to sand your fingers down to hit some of the smaller icons, if you have a lot of icons in your doc. And as another example, Marquez pointed out that the widgets on the home screen on the iPad are actually smaller than they are on an iPhone. So, basically you might multitask less because things feel cramped, or you might put fewer icons on your doc, or pick different widgets for your home screen than you otherwise would. This is what I mean when I say that this has not really just a big iPad, shrunken down. The smaller screen changes how you use it, even if you're not directly conscious of that change. Another use case that I think could make a lot of sense for the iPad mini, is giving it to a kid as a kid's tablet, 'cause you know, it's kind of kid sized. I do think this tablet is a little bit expensive for that though, especially compared to Amazon fire tablets, or even the bigger basic $329 iPad. I'd like to say that this makes sense as a shared family tablet, but that would require Apple to support multiple users, and Apple still refuses to add multiple user support to the iPad. And I'm not going to stop harping about it because it's dumb and they should. Okay, there's one more use case that probably isn't realistic for many people, but I do know at least one person who does this and that is, have a tiny little iPhone just for phone calls, and then use this as your primary computing device that you carry around with you everywhere, and like a little bag or whatever, having a big screen that's nevertheless, more portable than a full iPad is great. I love using this for the same reason that I love using gigantic iPhones. Big screens are really nice. Plus, on an iPad mini, you can do split screen. I do wish I could do split screen and like top to bottom, in portrait mode like you can do on Android phones, but, this works. And it really makes me wonder if Apple is ever going to put split screen on the iPhone pro max. I mean, they're the same operating system, Apple, just do it. As for battery life, this iPad mini definitely lasts a full day of a lot of use, but, not much more. Casual use will get you further, but the bottom line is the battery life is not as good as on a bigger iPad. And I can't not mention that there is no headphone Jack on this design, womp womp. Now the iPad mini and all of the iPhone thirteens landed on my desk, on the same day. I was very excited to test all of the iPhones, but I was excited to use the iPad mini. It just fits into my evening life so much better than a full-size iPad. It's big enough to feel immersive, but not so big that I'm tempted to do a ton of work on it. It's also big enough to like, lean back just enough that I'm not hunched over like you are with a phone, it's a literal distance that I don't know, just as a human body in the world makes me feel like I'm more open to engaging with other people that are around me than I am with the phone, and that I'm also more open, available to them to talk to me. It's really nice. All right, I know that's a little heady or whatever, let's get back to the basics, let's talk about the screen now. It is all right. It's high enough resolution, and even though it doesn't have a high refresh rate, or really get bright enough to use in direct sunlight, I can't complain too much, again, because if the screen were nicer, this thing would cost more. I have noticed just a little bit of jelly scroll, in portrait mode. That's where one side of the screen moves just a tiny bit faster than the other side, when you're scrolling. If you're the kind of person who can see this thing, I think you're going to eventually get over it, because I did. If you're not the kind of person who ever sees this kind of thing with the screen, do not sweat it. The new iPad mini also supports Apple's second generation apple pencil, which sort of, clicks right here on the side to charge. And I liked that on iOS 15, Apple finally added this quick-note feature, where you could just swipe up and then start writing to take a note. This is something Samsung has done with its stylist devices for years. Other stuff, you log in with touch ID on the power button here, and that works quite well. The camera on the front supports Apple's center-stage thing, where it tracks you as you move around for video calls and, it charges via USB-C, which means that the only iPad left that's a using lightning, is the basic iPad iPad, which by the way, also got an update with center-stage and a new processor. It is right here. It's $329, which is still a great deal today. I dunno, what else is there really to say. - (Character from the Simpsons) Say the line, Bart! It's an iPad. - (All) Yay! (Gentle Music) So those are my thoughts on the iPad mini. I like it a lot, and it fits for me, but don't assume it's going to fit for you. A big-screen iPad is a lot more convenient in a lot of ways, and it does a better job of acting as a computer, if you need that sort of thing for work. A big iPhone is more pocketable, and also it, you know, makes phone calls. Just remember that the iPad mini might look like an iPhone, or an iPad, and it even runs the same software, but, you're going to end up using it differently. The iPad mini is the middle child of Apple's iOS devices, and us middle kids, we do have our own identity, that's actually different from our siblings. So quit teasing us. Hey everybody, thanks lots for watching. Let me know, is this the size of iPad that you want? Have you been waiting for this? Are you a pilot or whatever? Talk about that, also of course, we've got the iPhone 13 and 13 pro reviews, you should definitely watch those.",

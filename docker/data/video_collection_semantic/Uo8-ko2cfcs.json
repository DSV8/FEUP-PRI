    "transcript": "- Hello and welcome to This Is. Austin. Why should I stop using Chrome? - I know that you've been using Chrome for a while, like a decade now? - That sounds about right, yeah. - Lately I am much more of a browser nomad, because I think the days of Chrome's tyrannical reign are coming to an end. - I mean that's strong, that's strong, tyrannical? - It makes a good title, okay. I'm out here to make a good title. People obviously have to click on the video. My thought on Chrome, is that it has been the standard for many years. And I did videos. I mean, I did a video on like Chrome in beta. Not to brag but like, I've been making videos on browsers a long time. - I mean, that is, that is a pretty big flex. - Look Matt, Chrome has been good for a long time. The issue though, is that with all things once it becomes the standard, once it becomes so widely used, there's room for improvement. There's room for things to expand and there are other options out there. Matt, when was the last time you installed a another browser that was not chrome? - With the exception of my previous job, where I was doing like installations and stuff for a school. Where we needed to use Internet Explorer for certain things. I don't remember the last time I've done that. - It just so happens Matt, that I have a wide variety of browsers that I'm going to attempt to get you to switch to. And first of all, I'll explain where I am today. - All right, let's hear it. - I have been using Microsoft Edge. Yes, the Microsoft Edge on my Galaxy Z Flip, as well as my Windows PCs. On the Apple side of the camp. I've been using Safari on Mac, as well as on iPad. - Now, I thought that Edge was only designed to download Chrome. - So, if you've caught one of the most popular episodes of \"this is\", where we talked a lot about why it was time to switch away from Chrome, then you know all about the new Edge. So, while yes, it might look like Internet Explorer of old. What you'll actually get on the internal side is essentially a Chromium build which Microsoft has been customizing. This is not a revolutionary concept, a lot of other browsers also use Chrome as their base. And they build additional features on top of that. But, at its core, Edge and Chrome are very similar in the way they work and the way they perform. And importantly, in websites, they actually do support. - So, explain this to me real quick. So, when we're talking about like Android, you know, there's the skins of Android. You know, was it TouchWiz, for Samsung? - I mean in 2012, it was, yeah. (chuckles) - Like, I haven't used Android in a long time either. Like, everyone said, like, alright, we wanna stock Android experience. Why would I not want a stock Chrome experience? If Edge is just Chrome under, you know, under the hood, with other things on top of it. - It's using the same core, right? It's using the same rendering engine. It's using a lot of the underpinnings, which honestly, at this point, the modern web is pretty much built around Chrome. The flip side to that though, is that everyone, including Google, add stuff on top of that, right? So, if you look at what specifically Microsoft did when they were developing Edge, and what all they took out of Chrome. There's so much, I don't wanna say junk. But there's so many extra features that have been kind of built up and built up over the last decade that Google has added. And with Edge, what we've gotten is something which is a little bit more stripped down, and fewer features have been added. But a lot of the features have been a little bit more laser focused. So, one of the big ones for me, is tracking protection. Now Google, as an ad company hasn't really been super forthcoming with things like, not only ad blockers, but specifically with tracking protection. With all the cookies that can track you around all kinds of sites around the internet. Microsoft with Edge specifically, has a slider where you can crank it all the way up and pretty much disable all of the tracking. Something you'll also find in Safari. And that's something that while, yes, Chrome is getting it, Chrome is getting it in like a year. - There's, I feel like there's certain trade offs for the conveniences that Chrome awards, and that's one of the trade off is the tracking for you know, they're an ad company. Just because of like the nature of how I like, you know, look up all these topics for, \"this is\" and stuff like that. I'm almost always in incognito mode, just to not muddy up, my, you know, my search history and stuff like that, and my recommendations. - I will definitely say, that there are legitimate features that I like inside Chrome. For example, the ability to log into different profiles. So, you can have multiple instances with, you know, logged into one account on one side and one account on the other. Like that something that is legitimately really nice. I would argue, and something that I personally feel is I don't want all of my stuff in one basket. I don't want Google to have literally everything. And so something I don't really mind is actually having some of that stuff with Microsoft, right? While previous Edge was pretty limited. In that, it was only really available for like Windows 10, I think, and it was, it maybe like iOS and Android. Now, the current Edge is available not only on Windows 7, but also it's available on Mac OS. Which is something that I actually have used fairly excessively. - A lot of people find that weird that Edge is available on Mac, but Internet Explorer used to be available on Mac as well. - So, on the Mac at the moment, and I've only really recently changed over the last couple weeks. I switched back over to Safari, as well as I definitely use Safari on the iPad. I also appreciate the Safari now on iOS, but also on the Mac, will allow you to automatically fill those two factor SMS codes. So, when you get a text of like, enter the code one, two, three, four, five, six. It will offer now like on the iOS side, but also on the Mac, it will pop up using Safari. So that's something I find legitimately useful. - I'm using iOS on Chrome, I mean Chrome on iOS, and if I get that, any type of two factor, sent to my phone, it ,I that pops up. So, that's not a safari thing. So I don't, I'm not gonna give that point to Safari. - I'm talking about a wide variety of browsers that are not Chrome. Safari is good, but Safari is obviously only good on Apple devices, right? So, unlike pretty much all the other browsers we're talking about, there's not really a safari version for Windows. There used to be and I actually used to use Safari for Windows way back in the day. But Safari is not, if you have anything that's not an Apple device in your life, it's likely not the best choice. Because obviously for the best results, you wanna use the same browser on your phone, on your tablet, on your laptop or your desktop, whatever the case is, you want to have the same thing. So Matt, let's go a little weird, because there are a couple of other options, which I find, while they might not be a full replacement for Chrome across the board actually have some real merit. Have you heard of a little browser called Opera? - I have. Now there's multiple versions of Opera, right? There's the regular one, and then there's a gaming version? - Exactly, yeah. What I specifically wanna talk about is Opera GX. Now, this is not strictly for gaming. Obviously, it's a browser, you can do anything. But, it has a couple of interesting features that are very gaming specific. So, first of all, you can actually limit your resources. So, Linus did a great video on this, where essentially you can easily cap it to say, only use two gigs of RAM or only use one of my CPU cores or one percentage or like whatever level percentage you want. Or even only use, like 1 Mbps or whatever the case is. You have sliders that can really limit exactly how many resources that the browser's taking up. Which if you're gaming, or really, if you're anyone, that's actually a nice feature to have. Because obviously, browsers will just eat up everything they can, because they think that that's important, right? So, it's nice to actually have, some of that stuff built in. - So, like I know that, Chrome uses tons of RAM. You know, Jonathan Morrison did that amazing video where he opened about how many tabs on the Mac Pro for 2TB of RAM or whatever. I've never experienced, like a problem with my system, you know, running out of RAM, because of Chrome. - Chrome has typically been kind of a little bit on the bloated side, but it actually is not that crazy. I feel like most browsers these days, have the RAM management fairly under control. But that being said, it's a different idea to have a browser which is, you know, smooth and runs easily and kinda doesn't eat up a lot of memory. And something like Opera which will allow you to customize the amount that you wanna use. - It's a good idea on paper, but I feel like me personally, if I was to be in control of those sliders. I'd get frustrated, I like, because I probably like, oh, let me turn down the bandwidth or whatever. And then get pissed off because my Reddit page isn't loading or something like that. - Yeah, it's still like smart about sort of swapping things in and out of memory. I think it's more useful if you have a lower end PC. - We're the royalty here all of our PCs have 16 TB of RAM at their disposal. - Matt I hate who you are as a person. Another option, which I do think is worth considering is Firefox. Firefox is one of the only browsers left that still develop their own engine. So, I haven't spent a lot of time with the most recent version of Firefox, which to be fair is probably a couple years old at this point. But, they have actually done a pretty major rewrite of the engine. And I know a lot of people actually really happy with Firefox. - Like I'm not saying that Edge is bad. Cause I haven't used it. I have not used it. I'm not arguing against it. Like I just don't see a reason for me personally to switch away from Chrome. Because, everything I do is so ingrained in Chrome, that it's, just the convenience factor is just hard to pull away from it. It's the same, reason why if you're, you know, in like the Apple ecosystem, it's hard to break away. You know, we're on YouTube. So, as soon as we sign into Chrome, bam, there, you know, there it is ready for YouTube. We do all of our Doc's on what some sort of Google service, again, all just integrated right there. So, like that integration is so hard to walk away from. - All I'll say is this, I've been happy with Edge. I am still probably gonna end up using multiple browsers cause I'm never gonna be happy with anything I use. But, I do think now is an interesting time to consider switching away from Chrome and trying some of these other browsers. Because while yes, the days of one being 100 times faster, or Internet Explorer being by far the worst are definitely over. But, there is certainly advantages to trying some of these things. And especially on the Edge side. I feel like it is probably the most well rounded package because something I hadn't even gotten into, is the fact that on Windows, it actually has internet explorer built in. So, if you're someone who's using Internet Explorer, I'm so sorry that if you're still doing that. Edge actually has a compatibility mode built in. - So, you joke about that but again, so, you know, I worked in a hospital, it was a university with a med school attached to a hospital. And a lot of the equipment that is run there, still needs to use Internet Explorer 6 or that compatibility mode. - So Matt, is it really time to switch away from Chrome? - You're absolutely right. I think I'm gonna go back to Netscape Navigator. But, let me know, what are you guys using as your browser? Let us know in the comments, like, subscribe, do the whole thing. We'll catch you next time.",

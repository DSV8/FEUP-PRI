    "transcript": "- [Michael] You know my favorite thing that happens, when a company sticks a two at the end of a product name? When in the process of doing that, it corrects almost every flaw that plagued the first one. From the debut event in Los Angeles, I'm Mr. Mobile and this is a first look at the Razar Phone 2. (electronic music) A blocky build chock-full of right angles, a slick and smooth 120 Hertz display, a big battery between even bigger speakers. Yep, it's a Razar Phone alright, and in addition to fixing the flaws of it's first phone, Razar has doubled down on what worked well. Last year I said the speakers were the loudest I'd ever heard on a smart phone. Well this year, they're louder. It's quite the achievement given that the Razar Phone 2 adds water and dust resistance, and that necessitated a rethinking of every casing penetrating component, but the volume buttons are just as clickey, the fingerprint sensor side button, just as much of a learning curve if you're used to the classics. The guts have gotten a makeover too, obviously Qualcomm's top-of-the-line silicone is here, at least until the expected December debut of it's sequel. Razar has done custom work around that processor too, replacing last years heatsink with a new copper alloy vapor chamber, for more efficient cooling. My biggest complaints on Razar Phone 1 were a very dim display mated to a truly underwhelming camera. Well Razar says it's corrected the latter, with brand new sensors, optimized software, optical stabilization, the works. And the selfie camera has gotten love too, with 60fps video support, which I'm told is a pretty great feature, if you're a twitch streamer. I won't know if the efforts have paid off till my full review, I can say, that the display is brighter by 50%. Now up to 645 nits maximum brightness, which not only helps with daylight visibility, but also makes HDR video pop compared to the old one. And finally, while it was prettying things up, Razar included two features I can't wait to spend more time with. Wireless charging behind the new Gorilla Glass 5 backplate, and a light-up logo, too. Now it's not just for looks, this is also the notification light, so if you want it'll blink red for Gmail, blue for Facebook messages, et cetera. And because it's part of Razars Chroma ecosystem, you can control the color, the breathing rate, almost anything you want. Naturally it's not all Chroma and rainbows folks, even though there's a dongle in the box, and a new 32-bit DAC, you wouldn't need an adapter if you just had a headphone jack. Also it's launching with Android 8.1, instead of the latest Android 9pi, and while Razar goes out of its way to pitch this as device that's not just for gamers, but for everybody who wants a powerful phone, it's a very distinctive device. It's not gonna be for everybody, especially not at a starting price of $799, a full hundred bucks more than last year. Am I excited to put this phone through it's paces despite all that stuff? You bet. Stay tuned for the full review, and stick around after the sponsor spot to hear a special bonus fact about a new Razar accessory. This video is brought to you by unboxed, and this sponsor spot, well it's aimed at my fellow creators. You probably already know these cats because they make some of the funnest tech roundups out there, but unboxed is also a platform for the top product experts on YouTube.

My thanks to unboxed, for sponsoring this video. Your promised bonus fact of the day, Chroma also makes its way to Razars wireless charger, which can either cast a rainbow while it's charging, display custom colors, or I'm pretty sure I was told, it can blink those same color-coded notifications too. Hit me up on Twitter for confirmation on that though. And yes, you can turn it off when you wanna get some sleep. Will you be lining up for the Razar Phone 2 on launch day? Let me know, in the comments, hit the subscribe button on YouTube so you don't miss that full review when it drops, and follow me on Instagram for Razar Phone 2 camera samples and other bite-sized bits in the meantime.

    "transcript": "Technology ends up in some very weird places. Today were going to review a very expensive pillow and this mattress for a high-tech 21st century bedroom. Lets get started. [Intro] So this pillow right here caught my attention on Amazon at a very expensive 300 dollars, which might change in the future since technology appreciates and depreciates. Ill leave a link in the video description so you can check the current pricing. Its been featured at CES, started on Kickstarter, and has been reviewed by quite a few different people. This smart pillow has a two week battery life. I never thought Id be plugging in my pillow before. I think its time to review this from the inside. There are some speakers, theres a vibration motor, and it can also keep you from snoring which is pretty interesting. So inside the box we have a plastic cover and then a pretty firm pillow inside. It definitely has some weight to it which is a good thing. Its got a free pillowcase and it has some more foam so you can adjust it and add more if you need to I guess. It has the wall charger, with a bunch of adapters for different countries. So heres the 300 dollar pillow itself. Looks like we have a wire here on the edge and you can also plug it in right here. Ill take off this outer shell. Thats probably so you can wash it without actually having to wash the actual pillow. Theres another zipper right here. Lets open it. Oooo check it out. This is a bunch of the purple foam that comes inside of the pillow. I have a feeling this is going to get rather messy in here. I fully expected that I would have to rip this pillow to shreds to find the electronics, and I still might. I dont feel any of the electronics in this pocket so well just close that back up. Looks like there is another zipper on this side. Still no electronics on this side, just a bunch more of this foam stuff. We might actually have to rip it open still. The good thing is that you cant really tell where the electronics are inside of it because of all the padding on both sides. So I mean sleeping on it, you probably wont be able to tell that its electric. Ooo I found one more zipper deep inside of it. Ooo check this out, I think I got it. Glad we dont have to slice things open. Here are the brains of the operation. Heres where it might get a little destructive. Yeah, so its got a little bit of adhesive here on this kind of memory foam stuff. Yeah, this definitely isnt made to be serviced. Looks like we have several speakers: one, two, three, four. And we have a flexible ribbon between each of these little modules. Im going to grab a screwdriver and see if we can take these things apart. I dont think Ive ever done a tear down on top of a mattress before, but we have four screws in each of these little modules. Theres also a gyroscope in here similar to what your cellphone has that can track your sleep motion and wake you up at the opportune time depending on your REM cycle. So now that we have the 16 screws removed, we can see all the internal components. And so each of these little things right here are a little tiny speaker. So there are 4 on the top and there are also 4 on the bottom part of it. And Im seeing two vibration motors on the two exterior modules right here and right here. I assume these go with the anti-snoring and with the alarm. You know, if you start snoring like this little microphone picks up, itll vibrate a little bit waking you up just enough to stop to stop snoring and lets you fall back to sleep again without actually waking you up all the way. Inside of these little extenders are the wires. These rubber parts just help keep the wires together. Then we have the massive 5,000 milliamp battery right here in the center. Pretty interesting, I never thought I would actually be tearing down a pillow on this channel, but theres a first time for everything. So with that snore alarm, apparently when youre snoring gets past a certain decibel level, thats when the vibration motors kick on. And you can set that vibration level depending on how loud you snore and when you want it to kick on. Overall I think its a pretty fun idea. Im sure how many people want to spend 300 dollars on a pillow, but if youre into like the high-tech environment, it might be fun. It might just make a better gift for the person who has everything because I guarantee they dont have this. Let me know what you think. Would you spend 300 dollars on a pillow even if it does do all the crazy things this one does? Let me know down in the comments. Now lets talk about this mattress Ive been sitting on. This queen-size mattress was shipped to me in the mail inside a relatively small cardboard box. This is intriguing for multiple reasons. Because it was shipped to me, its actually cheaper than a normal old-fashioned store bought mattress because those physical store locations have to pay rent, utilities, and multiple locations and commission for their employees. So this thing just got shipped to me and its completely flat. Its vacuum sealed right now, so Im going to cut it open, let air inside of the plastic and watch it expand. Casper, on the other hand, can cut those costs out of the equation by vacuum sealing their mattresses for tight storage and can pass the savings along to their customers, so thats pretty coolwith free shipping. Things are pretty much always cheaper on the internet. This mattress was made here in the USA and its really nice of Casper to sponsor this video and support my channel. I hope they dont mind too much if I show whats inside of their mattress. Zippers seem to be the theme of this video. So obviously we have a top layer up here that everyone can see. Then we have some layers underneath that not everyone can see. Looks like we have a layer of normal foam up here, and then this layer here is more of a memory foam. You can see it takes a second to replenish itself after I poke itwhile the rest of the foam doesnt. We have a transition layer here with the green foam; it has slightly larger air pockets inside of it. And then on the very bottom we have the support foam. This is probably the heaviest and the firmest layer. This 10 inch sandwich of foams is what makes the mattress so comfortable. Pulling all of the air out from inside the foam is what compresses it and makes it easy to ship in this modern, internet world. Casper said that anyone using the code JERRYRIG can get a 50 dollar discount on mattress. Another perk of a modern mattress is that with Casper you get a 100 night free trial. If you dont like the mattress during those 100 days, you can ship it back to Casper with that free shipping. Ill put a link in the video description. With an average of 4.8 stars on both Amazon and Google reviews, the mattress pretty much speaks for itself; you dont have to take my word for it. Sometimes I think random technology is the most interesting kind of technology so if you liked this video, hit that subscribe button, and thanks a ton for watching. Ill see you around.",

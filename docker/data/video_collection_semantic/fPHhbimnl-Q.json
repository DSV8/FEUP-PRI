It takes the classic Ducky One 2 Mini design and adds HyperX Red linear switches along with replacement keycaps to create something that's pretty cool.

    "transcript": "this is the HyperX ducky one 2 mini you heard that right HyperX ducky one 2 mini now there is no denying the fact that compact keyboards are very very popular among keyboard enthusiasts we can start a whole new conversation that would last for hours and hours discussing the chassis the PCB the switches the stabilizers switch loops the list just keeps going on but there is another market where people are looking for something to start with something that offers good quality switches good stabilizers RGB lighting customizability but most importantly something that comes in a small compact form factor now most of you are aware of ducky and the amazing mechanical keyboards they offer most of you are also aware of hyper xed they make great gaming peripherals so it's very refreshing to see both these players collaborate to bring you this limited edition mechanical keyboard yep unfortunately they're only making 3700 units worldwide and they're gonna be priced at 110 US dollars so it's ten dollars more than the regular or the standard one 2 mini from ducky so what's really new well there's actually not a whole lot of new with this keyboard guys in fact from the outside it looks identical to the standard model you get the 60% layout with the same chassis that's made out of plastic and HyperX comes in with their dual tone red and black color scheme the bottom no screams it is bright red glossy finish that looks pretty cool but it's not my cup of tea I prefer matte finishes but it doesn't really matter because no one's gonna look at the bottom anyway I should also mention that this keyboard still comes with the two-step angle adjustments just like these standard mini and since this is a limited edition run each unit is laser marked with its own unique edition number so if you want to feel special this is probably it though I really wish if I got the zero zero one out of the 3700 it's just cuz you know that would have been really nice I'm just kidding guys out-of-the-box you get a removable type C cable it's not rated which I love Thank You HyperX and ducky you also get a key K polar additional red color key caps and a ducky year of the rat spacebar which looks really nice especially with the LEDs enabled the key caps are double shot DVT with excellent matte texture and the LED shine through looks phenomenal one thing that did bother me was the HyperX escape key looks inconsistent compared to the rest this for sure is not double shot PBT it's just irregular ABS plastic it's a bit of an odd move for a limited edition keyboard in my opinion RGB lighting looks great just like the standard ducky keyboard the white floor really helps emphasize the laying in darker situations and now this is also driverless just like the standard model so make sure you don't lose the included manual because it walks you through these secondary functions the alt plus function commands recording macros I mean it is a ducky keyboard guys what's really new is the implementation of HyperX linear red switches if you recall these are the same switches from the HyperX alloy origins full-size keyboard that I looked at a while back now to be honest they remind me of Gator on rents which isn't really a bad thing because they're pretty fast and you don't experienced any tactile bump given their linear characteristics actuation point is slightly lower at one point even limiters with a total travel distance of 3.8 millimeters so it's technically faster than cherry MX red switches plus you also get a lifespan of 80 million keystrokes versus 50 million on cherry switches these also use the same MX stem design so you can easily swap peas with your own set of custom key camps so that's pretty cool also let's not forget ducky made this keyboard so they're not willing to sacrifice on quality because when you combine these new switches with good stabilizers and higher-quality double-shot BBT key caps the typing and gaming experience feels different compared to your average mechanical keyboard let's take a listen finally I want to conclude with some of my own thoughts about this keyboard well it is amazing to see both HyperX and ducky collaborate to bring you this limited edition keyboard which I'm pretty sure is gonna run out in the next 24 hours once this video goes live so if you really need it you better get to it as fast as possible I really wished if they offered this in larger quantities so then it would give ducky the exposure in regions where you can't easily buy a ducky keyboard now I'm not into 60% keyboards and this form factor is certainly not for me because it significantly affects my workflow when I'm editing in DaVinci Resolve or creating charts in Excel because they don't come with dedicated arrow keys or a dedicated Delete key and that's something that I truly truly missed from my vermelho vaat 7mt keyboard i just really love that keyboard i mean there's nothing there's nothing wrong with that but it's just that I would have been perfectly fine with the 1/2 SF which is a 65% layout and that has dedicated arrow and dilly keys that would have made a life a lot more easier for me personally but this one 2 mini is just it's not for me so on that note thank you so much for watching hope you guys are staying safe and healthy if you're interested in a full in-depth review of the ducky one 2 mini you can check out our video right over here we've also done a lot of coverage on these keyboards which again super popular keyboard I'm sure a lot of you will be excited about this and if you really want one of these you better get to it as fast as possible cuz like I said it is a limited edition run thank you so much for watching it's been responsible my friends and I'll talk to you guys in the next one",

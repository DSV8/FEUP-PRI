    "transcript": "- This video is sponsored by SOUNDPEATS. Nothing competes with a SOUNDPEATS. They make your head feel like you're wearing moss, peet moss, they're so comfortable. Just joking. Never heard of these guys. Maybe you should have, because we got some measurements for these two sets of earphones. I'll show you later in this video. And nothing to sneeze at. Don't sleep on SOUNDPEATS. They are, I would say, inspired by perhaps the models that you can find from a different notable company, in that there is a stem version. This is the Air3 Deluxe HS earphone. Everyone loves a good stemmy. They don't have the silicone ear tip. They just sit kind of on the, what would you call that? The threshold of the ear. Hey, I'm here, I'm not coming in. And then they've got the Pro. Oh, that was the back this whole time? It's the Capsule3 Pro. And you can see this is the official earphone of Paul Atreides. That's a joke. It's not actually not Timothee Chalamet, but this is the Pro and this is the act of noise canceling, in-ear ear bud. Let's see what's inside the box. Whoa. Also a stemmy. Ah, I'm getting so flustered, there's so many products. Not a lot going on in either box really. Some instructions, like a quick start kind of setup. Some hidden USB charging cable. This is A to C for the Air3s. And then in the Capsule3's Pro box we get the same deal plus a couple of different sizes of ear tips. Looks like we've got medium on them and then kind of a small and large. And they've got orange in the center too. All right, the earbuds themselves, starting with the Air3s. On the one side, I'd call this the backside, this copper and black kind of design with some branding on the front. And really non-descript though. You might also call it minimum. On the bottom, that's your charging port. USB type C. Is this a button? Yeah and there's a light above it. Cool. (clicking) That's what it sounds like when you open and close it. (clicking) On the inside you got this glossy gray plastic. Kind of cool. And then the buds themselves, logo on the top in the copper, contact points there. That's how they charge. And you can see a couple microphones. I believe there are four microphones for clear calls and that little mesh lattice to keep the earwax out. That's got a copper tone to it too. No peels for me to peel off though. Easy setup. Plug and play. Oh, they beeped. Oh, they both beeped. Hello? They just sit there and you know, they're pretty in there. Oh, what was that? No, what a way to end the week. I like to do the WWE test for a fit, like (thumping) and that's how you know. (thumping) If you can do that then they're, they're good. It's not the same when Undertaker's not doing it. 14.2 millimeter driver, five hours on the buds, 20 hours total including the battery of the case. The Capsule3 case is larger but maybe not heavier. It does have a larger battery. Rather than 20, it's up to 52 hours of total battery between the case and the buds. The buds themselves, I guess they do look a bit bigger but the drivers are actually smaller. They're 12 millimeter drivers. I guess in height, like they're pretty much the same. These ones are a little more ostentatious with the reflective copper band all the way down. Pretty much the same size as the other ones. The case bigger but maybe not lighter. You know what? Let's find that out. You know I got tools for that. 36 G bangers, 50! Was I ever wrong? Let's see how these feel. Getting right in my notoriously wet earwax. Wow, lots of passive isolation. These ones have six microphones and hybrid active noise canceling. Which brings us to our first graph. They measured really good, actually. Maybe a little too good. The noise canceling on these probably isn't as good as it looks in these measurements. We're still using a temporary setup right now until the lab is complete and we have an actual antico chamber to do all these things in. But why don't I actually experience this subjectively? So let's turn 'em on. You want to use my location? Only this time? Boom, it's connected just like that. Didn't even have to go to my Bluetooth settings. Hold down the pairing button with the lid open. Get your blinking whitey and boom. (laughter in distance) This room that we shoot these in has a weird electrical transformer thing over there that's is always humming. So I should be able to hear this A and C turn on when I hold this down. It's gone. And you know what? I know A and C is on because the voice told me. A and C on, on, on. Yo. What's up guys? - [Audience In Distance] How doing, how we doing? - You're passing through. Cool. Well let's listen to some music. Master Of Puppets. Did I listen to this last time? (music playing) Yeah, fairly detailed. They actually measure pretty good. You can see on the graph that they are slightly cooked on the bass, which a lot of people like in that song. It it manifested as like just a thumpier kick drum. The mids are pretty right on. And then there's just a little bit, little bit in the treble too, so they're just kind of V-shaped. Then you can go through the EQ modes. Let's take a look at them. Jerry Was a Racecar Driver. What is this? Is this like Adam music? Primus? This is ploof music. What is this? All right, let's try these ones that don't have A and C and see what they're all about. Game mode. Wow. That's where I can get latency as low as 60 milliseconds. These other ones, 70 milliseconds. I dunno how I got into game mode though. How'd that happen? These feel like I'm wearing nothing at all because they don't seal so much. Apparently tapping the left is game mode? Exit game mode. She's like your own personal assistant. I don't know how I entered it because I didn't think I did that. Okay, I can actually detect myself some differences between these two, but let's see what the graphs have to say. All right, first thing first. We're looking at the Air3's default EQ. Not a lot of bass and that's because of the seal. Because these don't have the silicone ear tip that makes a good seal in your ear canal. And since they don't have the seal, they don't have great bass there. Which could be a deal breaker for some people. And the mids are pretty good. Then there's a bit of a dip and then you see they're kind of bright and crispy in the treble. But they come with lots of preloaded presets. So let's see how those measured. So you can see there's like eight presets and the ability to make a custom one. We didn't make a custom one because with these guys the placement of them is so finicky because the seal is different every time, that we just felt like the, because of how easily they could adjust or fall out of our dummy head, it wouldn't really be replicable for you guys to use the custom preset that we would create. But we did make one for the Pros, which we'll show you in a second. You can use our settings. As far as the preloaded ones, as you can see, the deep bass didn't really go up very much but there is a bump in the 200 hertz kind of range. The lower bass is gonna be determined by the seal and since you can't get that they can't adjust it, but they, they bump where they can. And then as far as the treble, it's actually a little closer to the target curve than the default EQ was. And then looking at the rock and roll preset, it just hugs the target line a little better. And then the actually throughout the treble as well. Actually kinda just looks better than default one. I might, I might just use that one. But how about the measurements for the Pros? You know the ones that you're gonna get. So when I was listening to Metallica with these, I could notice in Master Of Puppets that the kick drum was a little thumpy. And you can see they are a little bit boosted in the bass compared to the target curve, which some people are gonna really like. And then they get closer to our target in the mids. They measure pretty well. And then if as far as the EQs, bass boost does what it says on the tin, look at that! A ton more bass. Bass reduction does reduce the bass, but also it affects the mids. Fashionable, I have no idea what that means. This is a fashionable EQ for 2023. Then you've got an EQ that appears to be for classical music, but somehow has really cranked bass. Our custom preset, we can see our settings here. Unfortunately there isn't a knob for you to adjust this lower section of the bass from below a 100 hertz. Not everyone's gonna like this EQ, but for those of you who do, you're welcome. Let's explore the app a little more. You can see the game mode, which is a triple tap, actually has its own toggle. So it does disable touch key one click functionality. What's that? So does in-ear detection, which you don't see that often. It pauses when you take one ear out. Very cool to have, but maybe you don't want that because you like to just have one in all the time or you wanna share it or something like that. So nice to have that as a toggle. So that is about it. They come in multiple colors, black and white, pink and purple. And all this for the low, low prices of 60 bucks for the Air3's and 80 bucks for the Capsule3s. However, you can knock half of that price off. So 30 bucks and 45.50 by using the offer code \"SCIRCUIT.\" S- Circuit. What a bargain. Check 'em outta the link below guys. Don't be a sound sheep. Buy SOUNDPEATS. It's Friday afternoon guys. Doing two trailers out. Check it out.",

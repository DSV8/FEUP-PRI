    "transcript": "- Today we are checking out (laughs) this is starting out great. This is the Echo Spot, it's essentially a squished down, circular version of the Echo Show. I unboxed the Echo Show here, not to long ago. Alexa, oh it's updating. What do I do? This is taking a really long time. And since then, I have got the Echo Show for pretty much everyone I know as a gifts, because it is probably one of my favorite devices in a very, very long time. For Christmas, I got my dad one of these, and the Echo Show. And what's great about this is it has a screen, it's integrated with Alexa, and it's kind of just like this little, tiny mini computer that just sits around your house. But it also has a built in camera, so you can make Alexa, I keep calling them Alexa time calls. (stuttering to say Alexa) I think it feels like Alexa time. (laughs) I don't think that's what it's called. It's essentially a FaceTime, but calling through Alexa. When I saw they announced the Spot, I pre-ordered this immediately. These came out the end of December. So, let's just stop talking and open it. Oh yeah, this looks great. They have two different versions, they have a black and a white. They also have the Echo Show in a black and a white version, too. I chose the black version, mostly because the one that I got originally was black. So I thought, let's just match them. It looks like a magic eight ball that's been cut in half. - Will Justine shatter her iPhone within the next month? - Don't shake it, that's where the, no. You go like this, yes. - No, you shook it. - No! - Are you sure? - Cause you're shaking it, and then there's bubbles and air. Apparently, it is decidedly so that I am going to shatter my phone in the next month. The set up on these are pretty simple, you basically just plug it in, you connect it to your Wi-Fi, and you connect it to your Alexa app on your phone. So here it is, and it really does just look like a chopped in half magic eight ball. Plugged in. - Hello. - Hi. - [Alexa] Echo Spot is ready for set up. - So it's kind of cool, because this is a touch screen, so you can interact with this directly. Just have to type in my Wi-Fi password. Since this is already connected to my network, and I already have one set up, it already says, \"Welcome, Justine!\" And if that's you, you type yes. Yes, that's me! Checking for latest software updates, this is where things tend to take a hot minute. What I really like about this too, is that you can enable Drop Ins, so if you want to Drop In on any of your friends who've also enabled Drop In, and allowed you to Drop In on them, you basically could just say, her name, call so and so, and then it will allow you to view their camera. Which yes, I know that sounds completely, absolutely terrifying, but that is an option you can turn off. So it's not like this is something that just because you have this, you can do that. It is an option, you can turn it off, don't worry. Echo Spot device will update, okay, install that. - [Alexa] If I install the updates, your Echo Spot will restart twice. - Okay, good to know. So if one of your friends has the Alexa app, and they don't necessarily have one of these, they can still talk to you and contact you, they just have to have the app. I'm so sorry, if any of you guys have your on, she's probably going crazy right now, because I keep saying the name, and I am so, so sorry. From here on out, if I'm not talking to her, I'm gonna call her A. I feel like this is an episode of Gossip Girl. One of the big trends at CES this year, was integrating everything with A and Google, so if you have Google Assistant or you have A, or even Bixby, if you're a Samsung user. Integrating all of these little smart home devices, into other things. So, for example, at the LG booth, I was using a remote control, to navigate my lights in my house. But that was using Google Assistant, so because it was hooked up to Google Assistant, I didn't actually have to say, \"Hey Google.\" I'm trying to space it out, because if you guys have these devices, I know they're going crazy. This thing is still updating, so I'm still talking to you guys. Another thing that you can do with this, is you can use room-to-room calling, so I have one of these in the kitchen, so as soon as thing is set up, I can use this to call down to the kitchen. If I'm traveling and I have my A app open, and I have Drop In enabled, I can drop in, from anywhere in the world, to my home, and see what's going on. Kind of sounds a little terrifying, does it? It is, but then it isn't. I mean, this is the future, so you either get with it, or you don't. - Or night stand. - Yup. Look at this, it's a little - [Alexa] Your Echo Spot is ready. - Okay I can't tell time on an analog clock, I need digital. We've got the weather. Alexa, what's five times 235? - [Alexa] Five multiplied by 235 is 1,175. - I love math. Ed's home, recently active, so we're going to call my friend Ed. Hello? - [Ed] Hello? - Hello, do you, well you won't see me, cause I'm filming you. (laughs) There you are! - Hello, here I am. - Say hi to the internet. - Hi internet, what's going on? - So there's - Tell me later. - Wait, where's the little? Oh, there I am, so that's them, right there. - Looks cool, did you get the white one or the black one? - I got the black one to match the other black one. - Does it have, oh here comes Gus. - Kitty! - He always comes up when someone's on here, so this is me, rubbing Gus' tail. - It's really cute. (laughs) This thing is so great, I love it. Oh my goodness, that's like the most precious thing ever. - (laughs) It's us, all day. - Well thanks for accepting my call. - [Ed} Yeah. - Okay, well, I'm going to continue my review, my review is it's cool. - Wow look at that rig, wow. - Do you see that light, I added my new light up here now. - [Ed] Wowee. - Yes, wowee! (laughs) - Oh no, that's proof! - So when I went to CES, I was doing a wowee factor, but I started it too late, it was at the end. I was like, oh, we should do a wowee factor, from like one to like a hundred, that's it. - That's really cool. - Alright. - Well, hi everybody, bye everybody. - Bye, hi, bye, say how do I end? Alexa, end call. Now I can go into the app, and I can do a couple of the things here, and I can make some little changes, like I can change the face. So is it weird if I make a photo on my Alexa, a picture of me holding the Alexa? So I'm going to show you really quick, as an example. (reverberates) Oh no! So if I have this in my office, like I said before, I can just drop in using my phone, and I can see what's going on in my office, just using my phone. So guys, this is the Alexa Spot, I'm such a huge fan of all of the things that Amazon has been doing with the integration of Alexa. I'm so excited for the future of what they're going to do. Because if this is what they have now, I can only imagine what they already have in the works. What can we look forward to next? I don't even know, but I can't wait to find out. Let me know, if you guys have any suggestions for things that you'd like me to review or unbox here, and also let me know what you think the future of Amazon is going to make next. (gasps) I don't know. (outro music)",

    "transcript": "- [Narrator] This time last year, the Mr. Mobile YouTube page was just a place holder. The subscriber and video counts tied, at zero. Ten months later, 350,000 people have subscribed, and more than 28 million have tuned in. That's an awful lot of Michael Fisher talkin' about gadgets, none of which would have been possible without all of you. So to thank you for staying mobile, I've hit up all these companies for free stuff. And, they actually sent it! And all you have to do to qualify for your chance at a slice of it, is to say something nice. This is the Mr. Mobile 100th Video Thank You Giveaway. So, we all know the reputation that YouTube comments have. It's a cesspool, right? But from the beginning, I've been fortunate enough to have a comment section that's actually a kind of cool place to hang out. So, for my first ever giveaway, I want to spread the love. To qualify for your chance to win any one of these prizes, all you have to do is this. Leave a positive comment on another tech YouTuber's video. It can be any YouTube video that covers technology, and your comment needs to be positive and relevant to the video. So, a single thumbs up emoji, or a \"Good vid, fan\" is not gonna cut it. Instead, I'm looking for, \"Hey, cool review, I love \"the cinematography\", or \"Great job with \"the jokes, I LOL'd!\" And finally, I need to know you did it. So, screenshot the comment. Send it to this email address, and bam! You're entered to win. I'll start drawing winners seven days from the date of this video, and as I pick 'em, I'll send you an email. So keep and eye on your inbox. You'll have a limited time to reply, telling me which prize you want from the pile, before I move on to someone else. And of course, early folks will have the choicest pick of awards. - He won that, it's a major award. - [Narrator] What are all those awards? Well ... - Hold on to your butts. - [Narrator] Smartphones. A Galaxy S8, or Iphone7. An LGG 6, from LG, and one from AT&T. Two ONEPLUS 3T's, in midnight black. High end phones from Huawei, and Honor. A Moto Z Force, with Moto Mods. The new Blackberry Key1, a LeEco Pro3. Holy Momo, there's a lot of phones, here! Also, Samsung's newest tablet, the TabS3. Lenovo's crazy futuristic Yoga Books, one in Windows flavor, and one in Android. Bluetooth headphones from Sennheiser and Plantronics. LD West original holsters. Gadget pocket packed hear from SCOTTeVEST. Battery packs from Anker, and others. And finally, a 55 inch, 4K TV from LeEco. - Oh my God! - [Narrator] I know, it's a lot of stuff. I just want to make sure you're feeling sufficiently thanked. And I'm getting new submissions from giveaway partners literally every day. So, there might even be more hardware on the list, by the time you see this. If you want more chances to win, you can have them. Just go to the link in the description, and follow the directions for more entries. That's also where you'll find all the fine print. Like, yes, this is a global giveaway. Except for a few items that we can only ship to the US. - Just one more thing. - [Narrator] I'm not making it a requirement to subscribe to Mr. Mobile on YouTube to win. That's how you get bots, Pam. But, and here's where I get a little earnest with you, I am trying to hit a million subscribers by the end of 2017, and frankly that's looking like a stretch right now. So please, like they say on MST3K, keep circulating the videotapes. Share every video you can, and ask your friends to subscribe to Mr. Mobile, for more mobile tech video every week. Until next time, thanks for your support. Good luck! And stay mobile, my friends. (pop music)",

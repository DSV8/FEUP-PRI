    "transcript": "- Wanna spice up your gaming setup? Look no further than TikTok. They've got thousands, no, millions of videos that show you how to create the best setup around. It's just that some of them are better than others. Fear not though. We're gonna take one for the team. And test out the best tech hacks. Starting with this one from Janelle and Kate with over 883,000 likes. Why? No! Why? Why? No. No, we're not. No! - [Alex] It's TikTok, Linus. You need the views. - Oh God. They make it look easy. - Also, you're not doing anywhere near enough. Look at how much they have up there. - Well, I mean, that seems like a lot. Look, Alex, I don't think there's any right way to do this. But there is the right way to tell you about our sponsor, VRLA Tech. They sent over their Helios Gaming PC and it's a freaking beast. We're talking Core i9-13900KF, GeForce RTX 4080, 64 gigs of RAM, and five terabytes of storage. If that isn't what you're after, you can completely customize your system on their website which we're gonna have linked down below. I'm gonna go ahead and say that this TikTok exists only to laugh at you because you ruined your keyboard. Remember, there's no wrong way to do this. Do you think I need more glue? - [Alex] Well, she has it between all the function keys and stuff too. - I have it between the function keys. Alex, again, I cannot emphasize this enough, There's no correct way to do this so. - [Alex] That's some nice glitter. Really fine. - [Linus] Yeah, it's really nice. I need the next step in the instructions. Ah, It's everywhere! And she said to tap. - [TikTok] The glue will protect it, I think. - (long sigh) Okay. Oh, no. Yep. That's exactly what I thought was gonna happen. - [Alex] That's so bad. - Yeah. Um. - [Alex] It looks somewhat... Oh. - Nailed it. I rate this tech TikTok zero out of 10 and I sincerely hope this is the worst one we're doing today. As a YouTube native, I've gotta say, coming over to TikTok, there are some really fascinating videos where they're clearly designed just to keep the viewer's attention even if nothing of value is being added. But not everything on TikTok is intentionally bad. Some of it's just bad. Like this monitor painting video from Nicole Skey. That's not...You don't want that on your... Wait, wipe down the screen. Wait. She's not gonna paint the actual panel, is she? The real way to do this, TikTok, is to take the actual monitor itself off of the stand, disassemble it, which should take no more than five to 10 minutes with most standard monitors, Paint it, then put it back together. You may have noticed this monitor got a little bit mangled in a previous video. We should still be able to get it apart and back together. So the only thing that this affects for what we're doing today is that you may actually have an easier time getting things apart than I am. This is \"Linus Tech Tips,\" not \"Linus Tok Tiks.\" Beautiful. One thing she got right was shaking up the paint can. Something she got wrong was her work area. You always wanna be in a well-ventilated workspace when you're working with paint or really any other aerosols. Ideally, she should have been outside. Definitely not in her bedroom. Although, the paint fumes could be good for creativity. Ooh, I do not want to get paint on this. Always important. Keep the can moving. You're far better off doing more light coats than fewer heavy coats in terms of getting a decent finish. What could go wrong? Oh, look at that. For the best results, you should follow the guide we did a few years ago where you disassemble the monitor, sand, prime, paint, and clear coat for a professional finish. But if all you want is a quick way to change the color of your display, this will do the trick. Or if you don't like painting at all, there's an alternative, as shown by TikTok Flex and Flora. And you can use vinyl for a lot more, as shown by Eden DIYs. This is one we don't even need to try out to give it an eight, or maybe even a nine out of 10. Because it's something that we've been doing for years. Here's the table in our build corner, which has a marble vinyl wrap over top of it, and I bet most of you didn't even notice. As you can see, it's not the most durable thing in the world, and you get, you know, nicks and scratches and scuffs all over it compared to an actual marble countertop. But unlike a marble countertop, when you get sick of it or if it gets too scuffed up, you can just peel it off and redo it. The video is a little weird though. You noticed the audio was just explaining a feature of TikTok. It had nothing to do with the hack whatsoever. - [TikTok] Did you know you don't have to tap the profile picture to get to the person's profile? All you have to do is swipe left. - It's so tight they gotta edit these things. Really, you don't have enough attention span for me to talk about and show the same thing at the same time. What about vinyl on your computer though? If this video from Grim Collection is anything to go by, it can look sick. Ooh, and we've got two different kinds of film here. We are looking at either mirror or rainbow. - Oh, I really, really want to do rainbow. Social media person says that, you know, the mirror is more true to the original. I want to see rainbow. I don't know. It's not as rainbow-y as I was hoping. - Yeah, I was really hoping for a lot more rainbow. - [Alex] It's more like your aunt's shower. - Yeah. - [Arjun] No, when the light gets emitted through, it's gonna look rainbow. - Oh, okay. Hold on a second. - [Alex] Oh, there we go. - Okay. All right. It's in. Okay, so I actually have never applied one of these before. - [Arjun] Good luck. - That's it? That's all you guys have given me. Our sponsor, VRLA Tech, asked to be included in the TikTok hacks. I suspect ruining their side panel was not what they had in mind. It's a perfectly nice computer already and this probably isn't necessary. I mean, you know, I'm kind of, I'm kind of getting it. Oh gosh, oh. Oh crap! - [Alex] You got this. - I put it on the wrong side. We're a little short here. And to think, without TikTok, I wouldn't be having all this fun. - [Alex] TikTok, middle-aged man struggles to apply rainbow vinyl. - I am not middle-aged yet. Just cut out all the other stuff and show this. That was a test fit. Now we're gonna put water on the surface and on the vinyl to show you how it's done properly. We were seeing how many of you are gonna comment before actually watching the whole video? Here we go and... Oh, it came off a little bit there. That's okay. Wow. I think that might be our first ever 10 out 10. VRLA Tech offers loads of options on their site with different fans, coolers, GPUs, RAMs, storage, et cetera. The standard Helios comes in the O11 Dynamic so it's a larger build. But they sent it over in the AIR MINI because that's the kind of thing you can do. You can have Intel or AMD, DDR4 or DDR5. They give you all the options and they have very competitive pricing. They not only have gaming PCs, but they have workstations as well. So whether it's for work or play, there is something for everyone. And if there's something that you want that is not listed on the site, they're still happy to install custom parts for the customer. They just need to let customer service know and they will take care of it. The 200 customers who use code \"LINUS\" can get $100 off their PC from VRLA Tech using the link down below. If you're not satisfied with tape, just on your monitor and computer though, Tidal Baum has got you co... - This mouse, apparently, is the best one for drag clicking according to competitive Minecrafters. I had to steal this from Maria. - And that's a thing? - Yes. - Competitive Minecrafting? - I guess so. - Okay. The Kone XP. Where's our tape at? - Before you do this, see how fast you can click without it? I was able to get 53. That was my record. - 53 without this? - [Alex] Right. - There's no way I can do 53. - [Arjun] You got this. - [Alex] I was a drummer for many years. - Ah, I'm not gonna do it. Oh my God. Okay. I'm not entirely sure I even understand. Oh. I'm gonna have paint, glitter, and gold Sharpie on my fingers by the end of this. What? - Are we sure gold Sharpie is the same as silver Sharpie. I have a silver one upstairs. - [Alex] I don't... - [Arjun] Why would that make a difference? - There we go. - [Linus] Whoa. Are you doing it? What? - 11.6 clicks per second? Dang, it actually works. I tried this- - Did it just need to dry more? - I don't know. I actually tried this for like 45 minutes yesterday and couldn't get it, and now it's just working. - Okay. Okay. This is another nine out of 10. This is a sick, sick hack. You might have noticed that up until now, other than applying a couple of stickers, we haven't really de-blandified our setup. But don't worry, we're gonna show you that now in the TikTok way. By not showing you at all. Oh hey, look. Our monitor's back. Actually looks not bad for a 20 minute job. I mean, it didn't do anything for the waviness. Let's see how it compares to our TikToker's version. Ooh, I don't know if you're getting info, but you're... Ooh. Oh. Oh no. No! Oh no. - You should not use rubbing alcohol on a screen. One outta 10. Ours is way better. Our next TikTok hack is sort of the opposite of what we've done so far. The silent reviewer shows us, rather than how to apply stickers to things, how to remove them... But he's using hand sanitizer. And the benefit is that it won't have any smell? - I think the last one that they used was like mineral oil or medicated oil so. - I mean, it would be an improvement over that, but I would think we would just use... - [Alex] Yeah. - 99% isopropyl alcohol. Either way, we're gonna give the hand sanitizer a shot. Who knows? Maybe this is an outstanding TikTok hack. We've got some residue over here. Why don't we pull off? Let's pull off a sticker. And then we'll do half of the residue with isopropyl and we'll do half of it with hand sanitizer. This is actually the perfect example of the kind of thing that you'd wanna remove with this method. Overall, pretty good sticker. Came off okay. But there's definitely some residue. All right, here we go. Hand sanitizer. Man, if you don't want residue, you obviously shouldn't be using hand sanitizer. Yes, they have alcohol in them but they're also full of like, you know, aloe and scents and things that people want to keep their hands from getting dry as opposed to just alcohol. In fairness though, that did work reasonably well. The question is just if you're trying to put alcohol on something, where'd it go? Why not just put alcohol on something? - [Alex] So? - Holy (beep) Alex. No, it's not. - [Alex] It isn't? - No, it's not better. It's not better! What's in you? Purified water, carbomer, glycerin. - [Alex] Oh. - Interesting. That actually works great. It could just be as simple as having a thicker consistency making it so that the alcohol doesn't just evaporate away so quickly and it almost gives you like a little bit more scrubbing power. But it legitimately works better. All right. Eight outta 10. Eight outta 10. - [Alex] I can't believe it. - Not what I was expecting. Let's see what we've got next. Carter PCs. Who I follow? I have no idea who this is. - But hey, I'm not complaining. Can these birds please shut up? I'm doing... - He's talking into a lint roller. - But anyway, if anyone from LTT is watching this, a few things I should mention. First of all, I am very against cable ties which might be sacrilegious at Linus Media Group, but, you know, Team Zip Tie all the way. And second of all, I know Linus loves brown switch. - Wait, what? Hold on. Who does this guy think he is? Against cable ties, pro zip ties. - Oh, Linus, we get to play a game. Do we unfollow him now? - Oh. - The power's in your hands. - Hold on. I haven't watched the rest of this. Okay, hold on. - You know, come to think of it. This video is just meant to say thank you for the follow, and I just gave him like four reasons to unfollow me. I'm so stupid. - Okay, hold on. Okay, Alex, do you wanna take the other side? - [Alex] Sure. - All right, Carter PC. You're welcome for the follow, but you're kind of on the chopping block here. You've given us a lot of reasons to unfollow you. Doesn't like cherry browns. Actually, that's not that controversial these days. I'm not gonna count that. Hates cable ties, though. Very upset. Cannot count. Gave two reasons to unfollow. Says he gave four. Absolutely. This, this right here. This is bad. Cannot count. Means we can't count on you. Why did we follow in the first place? I actually have no idea. He referred to us as Michael Jordan. I didn't hear that. - That wasn't a different TikTok. But he referred to you and JayzTwoCents as Michael Jordan. - I hate it when bonafide tech YouTubers come to TikTok like JayzTwoCents, Linus or ScatterVolt, for example. See, I'm a youth basketball coach and I'm teaching these nine year olds, you know, elbow in, flick your wrist, blah, blah, blah. And then Michael Jordan walks into the gym and starts telling these kids like, \"Okay, you should also do this, this, and this.\" That's Michael Jordan. I learned from him. - All right. That's a neutral. That's a neutral right there. Good content though. - For TikTok. - Hmm. All right. He keeps the follow. He keeps the follow. Next up, we've got several products that you need to buy, which are definitely real things that this person actually uses and not just Amazon Affiliate bait. - [TikTok] Five helpful gadgets from Amazon. - Oh God, did we actually buy that thing? - [TikTok] For your Zoom meetings. With one touch, you're able to mute and unmute, and open and close the video. - You do not a dedicated button to mute your microphone. No, you don't want, wait. Why are you putting a sticker on there like that? It's gonna rub against the bottom of your thing. - [TikTok] Next is this portable charger with three built-in cables and you can plug this directly into the wall to charge. - What even was that that I just looked at? - [Alex] Oh, this one we actually got. - Oh, good. Doesn't charge your AirPods? - [Alex] Wait, it doesn't? - Does it? - [Alex] Oh. - [Arjun] No, it just hold them. - I don't see contacts. - I thought that your case went on. - It just holds your AirPods. - Wouldn't it also just deplete the battery? 'cause it would still be connected when it's in that? - Yeah. No, I think they should go into standby. Also, these are gonna get lost five sure. Like there's, there's no way. I don't need an iPhone and AirPods to know that an AirPods holder that doesn't charge your AirPods is (beep) stupid. Rechargeable hand warmer for gamers. Oh God. - [TikTok] In just 30 seconds. And no, we're not gonna use hot water 'cause don't do that Instead... - Because don't do that? Why not? - [TikTok] Instead, here's a cheap hand warmer that you can buy on Amazon and it's really cheap as well. - Oh good. A cheap hand warmer that is really cheap as well. Is this only 20 bucks? And two pieces? - [Alex] Yeah. - 5,000 milliampere hours. Even just as a battery bank, this might make sense assuming that capacity is real. It's getting warm. I can feel the current flowing, Alex. I'm giving this one a two outta 10. If you're a real gamer, you know how to warm your hands. Like that. Now it's time for some software hacks. Do this so your friends think you are hacking. You do not need to full screen that. Okay, and I don't need this audio. That's just a list of the directories on the computer. - I really love this one because it's so much worse than just going to Hacker Typer and also so much more difficult. - Well, we're supposed to do it right? - [Alex] Yep. - How did you change the color again? - [Alex] Color a. - Okay. - Oh, I spelled color the Canadian way. Whoops. - [Alex] Wow. - I'm hacking. I'm hacking the mainframe. The real way to do this is to go to hackertyper.com and start hacker typing. (keyboard frantically clicking) Tell me you're a hacker without telling me you're a hacker. I want to read this New York Times article, but it requires a paid account. Change \".com/\" to \".com./\" and yell \"I'm in.\" Shut up. Does this actually work? Is it that easy? Because I've been like going into Incognito Mode and then just switching to my mobile network anytime I need to read something. - [Alex] I honestly haven't verified this 'cause it's so easy and so stupid if it just works. Just a period? - [Linus] Just put a period in there. Is that it? That can't be right. No. - [Alex] Yeah, yeah. - [Linus] That did not work. - [Alex] That didn't work. I'm not surprised, but I am disappointed. - They apparently have patched this. Zero outta 10 hack. Fun fact about Samsung phones. (gentle upbeat music) Hold on a second. I can get a picture of a chihuahua on my phone. Hold on a second. Hold on. This is life changing. Asterisk, pound, zero, asterisk, pound. Whoa. Hold on. How do I get the dog? I want the dog. And you click the image test. Whoa, I got the dog! - [Alex] Yeah! - I mean, that's pretty useful. Okay, so we've got like a QC menu like a diagnostic menu, on my Samsung phone. I have never accessed this before. I'm giving this one a solid eight and a half. I like it. Black! Now with a 100% more- Oh God. How do I get out of- Oh, my lock button's not even doing anything. I'm downgrading you. This is now a six outta 10 hack. Try at our own risk. Oh, hold on. Emergency SOS. What the- No, stop. Stop. Okay. I like it. Eight and a half outta 10. - Hi, I'm Caitlin. I'm a cybersecurity data privacy and protection expert and I wanna show you what Google knows. Let's go. You're gonna type in this website. - Settings.google.com. Let's go. Oh, I should do that on my phone then, hey. Okay. Add topics for you. Vehicle parts and accessories. games. Role playing games. Massively multiplayer online games. Bit of a theme here. Motor vehicles. Home audio and video. Laptop computers. Industrial goods and manufacturing. Video game consoles. Mobile phones, accessories. Shooter games. Web design and development. Web hosting. And flashlight apps. Okay. We probably don't need flashlight apps. How about you? It's gotta be more car stuff than me. - What I found interesting in mine is that it's completely different from my work to my personal account. - Right? - Like personal account. It's like income's high for some reason. My other one is like medium high. - Okay. - They both think I'm a homeowner, which isn't true. Small employer. - Small employer? - Yeah. - Oh, like that you work for? - Yeah. - Oh, okay. Ouch. Mail? 35 to 44. Oh my god. I'm in that bracket now. Married. High income. Bachelor's degree. Nope. Not enough industry to figure out my info and thinks I work for a large employer. Nice! - You know, I think the takeaway is you can tell them which information you want them to have, which is nice. - And finally. - [TikTok] A customer of ours brought us their gaming PC and told us that it's having some issues. - This is a repair shop, Gamer Tech Toronto - [TikTok] And Low FPS. After booting into Call of Duty, I did notice some FPS drops and couple stutters. Generally when this happens, the first thing you wanna do is look for any graphics driver updates. When you're updating your graphics drivers, don't click the express installation, click custom and click this clean install. This is gonna completely remove your old graphics driver from the system and reinstall the new one. Since the customer- - Well, this is a pretty good, this is pretty good tech advice. - Oh yeah. - Yeah, this is really good. Yeah. Nine outta 10. 10 outta 10. Update your drivers. Update your bios. Great work. - The part that got me about this one was that someone brought their PC into a tech repair shop to update their drivers. - Oh. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. That. Man, you'd be surprised. If you guys enjoyed this video, you might also enjoy TikTok Hacks Part 1, which had worse ones. - That's pretty debatable.",

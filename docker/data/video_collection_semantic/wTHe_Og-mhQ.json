    "transcript": "[Music] in this package that looks a little bit like Lifeboat rations we have another fascinating AliExpress graphics card specimen but before we start probing our specimen a word from today's video sponsor today's video is sponsored by Corsair and their fancy Dominator platinum ddr5 in White NOW aside from the obvious hello epine that comes with these dark black kits they also perform very well you can get 32 gig kits in up to 6200 megahertz speeds in the white version and that performance combined with their 12 ultra bright capellix RGB LEDs make these a great option for any high-end gaming system check out the Corsair Dom Platts in white using the link in the description below thank you Corsair for sponsoring today's video [Music] now I've not exactly had to open Lifeboat rations before so I'm not sure how this works but I'm assuming by this line of tape here that I should just cut along that [Music] thank you foreign unboxing AliExpress stuff is always such a surreal experience that kind of feels like unboxing a harvested organ you bought off the internet hey getting right to the good stuff back here and it's turning around [Music] whoa um first thing there is a little bit of damage on the rear i o Shield which I don't know how they manage considering how well protected the graphics card was in shipping although I think I may have spotted the problem it doesn't actually line up with the screw hole that's used to secure it above the HDMI slot that's also a real interesting looking HDMI port that's so janky I love it although putting aside the i o Shield that was clearly found in a bin and the fact that the graphics card seems to be exuding a film of sticky protective cheese basically the entire graphics card is made of metal this entire shroud is metal the back plate is metal and so is the front here and look at that I've not seen that on a graphics card in a while we have dual 8 pins on the front of the GPU not on the top here and I like that I actually think in a lot of cases this may be quite a smart place to have your power connectors because you can more easily cable manage it although that does very much depend on your case that is a solid heatsink we have under there we have our two fans with the very off-center sticker on them oh oh so the rattle was caused by the end of a screw yeah I'm not really sure where the rest of the screw is and hopefully it wasn't holding down anything important because well that thing's not being held down anymore and then as you can tell from the other sticker this graphics card hewn of Steel is an RX 5700 XT actually it's build quality kind of reminds me of the reference 5700 XT let's just give me a second let's have a look this is a reference 5700 XT that I used for a while in my main system and I think even with its dent it's quite a good looking graphics card it's also all metal the Shroud and on the back plate although this is clearly higher production value metal than on the AliExpress card you've got this kind of texture on the back plate and I think even this Radeon logo lights up having said that I kind of remember this reference cooler howling like a banshee with its tail caught in the door so the other Express cooler may give us better temperatures and noise but we'll compare them soon enough first I just want to kind of wipe the cheese off of the AliExpress card and then do a quick tear down so that we see what's going on under that metal cooler [Music] okay it does smell a bit like a Distillery now but at least it doesn't feel like it's got a thyroid problem anymore so that's good it is now the future and I've tested this card which makes me even more excited to have a look at what's going on underneath here I'm not sure what the HT on the screw sticker means I'm just gonna assume it says hurry try [Music] yeah I really like this all the screws on the back are the same so you don't have to worry about sticking it in the wrong hole it really wasn't just seven screws okay oh no it's my least favorite thing in the world fan clip this is one of those that inevitably break every time you undo them or at least every time I undo them oh again I'm very glad that all these screws are the same oh that's actually worked this time that's good okay clearly that's the way to do it wow that is the bottom of a relatively basic heatsink but it looks fine to me although there is some solder splatter around the heat pipes where they attach them to the finare which I've not really seen that on a heatsink before moving on to the PCB clearly the thyroid problem extends to the PCB because there is quite a lot of sweating around the the memory modules with the 5700 XT there are components on this PCB like this one here is definitely one of them I think that one as well the cooler on the reference PCB actually has pads that make contact with these so I'm not sure if it's a problem that these are just open air it could be that they're made contact with because it's a blower style cooler and the this kind of like more open air cooler design just blows enough air on it for it to be fine and here is our GPU die that clearly isn't from a GTS 450 so that's very good I love how there are pinots for external power facing down on the PCB it's good that they didn't put them here as opposed to on top [Music] yeah I don't know it's just the back of a graphics card it seems perfectly reasonable so now I am going to reassemble this card but we're gonna jump back into the past and have a look at uh if this graphics card actually fires up and what kind of gaming we can do with it [Music] so now we finally get to see if we have to go through the driver install process equivalent of trying to summon a demon into a new host like we had with our previous AliExpress graphics card hey [Music] it's just output a signal that is a pretty good start and after a quick ddu wipe the driver install off of amd's website installed without the need of any form of seance it just kind of worked which is awesome so let's try and do some gaming on this surprising card would you look at that we've got some high performance GTA 5 action happening here this is a 1080p with uh pretty much everything cranked in terms of settings yeah I mean this is this is looking really good that power draw is impressive that is actually a suspiciously low power draw I don't think the 50 700 XT is a very frugal graphics card in terms of power usage so I think this AliExpress card may be fibbing a little bit especially considering that I tried to read the fan speed earlier and it said there was zero percent fan speed but the fans were definitely spinning so we'll drop the reference GPU in here later and see how its power draw and performance Compares but first let's try a more demanding game [Music] this is running a 1080p High settings the same settings for Battlefield 5 that I used in the last couple of videos and this may be a relatively bare map in terms of foliage and stuff so it's not super demanding but when I did the standardized Benchmark for this graphics card we were getting very similar results to the RTX 3060 that I bought the other day which cost a whole lot more money than I paid for this 5700 XT and yeah Battlefield 5 loving AMD booty and all that but we're bouncing off the frame rate limiter it's awesome it is very audible you can definitely hear the graphics card whining but the temperatures are are pretty solid for a 5700 XT so you should be able to play with the fan speed [Music] yeah okay so the temperatures have kind of topped out at about 72 it did occasionally creep up to like 75 degrees Celsius but yeah that's with very low fan speeds right and and this the cooler definitely has a lot more Headroom in it let's try cyberpunk and see what that does before we drop in the reference uh 5700 XT to see how it Compares wow even cyberpunk at 1080p High settings is running well we're sitting in the 70 frames per second which I feel like is a is a very good point for cyberpunk to be it's where the game feels you know about as responsive as cyberpunk can feel I'm still convinced the graphics card's lying about the power drill though so let's drop the reference 5700 XT in here and see how they compare [Music] okay so it's pretty clear that other cards lying because we are getting about the same boost frequency about the same frame rate oh slightly higher temperatures I guess the same temperatures although this uh this blower style card is noisier and it's actually got worse coil wine this this reference 5700 XT has some of the worst coil wine of any graphics card I've tested before it's real bad anyway it's got very similar parameters to its running but it draws up to about 187 Watts which I think is a bit more than up to 130 Watts but at least performance wise they are running very similarly and finally pricing wise when all is said and done that means including tax and shipping I paid a total of 240 Canadian dollars for this AliExpress RTX 5700 XT which considering that you get a thyroid disorder included that's a whole lot of graphics card for the money anyway thank you for watching if you enjoyed the video subscribe to the channel for more videos like this one and maybe consider watching another video a suggestion will pop up in a second and until the next video bye [Music] thank you",

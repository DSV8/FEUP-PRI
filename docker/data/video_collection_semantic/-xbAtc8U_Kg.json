    "transcript": "- What's up guys, Lewis here, back with another video, and today I've got another bluetooth speaker. Now, bluetooth speaker videos are some of my favorite to make, but this bluetooth speaker is a little bit different. It's got a magic trick, a secret, if you will. Plus, it's got some weight to it. What is this company, Maqe? Looks like 'make' with a q instead of a k. It's called the SoundJump wireless, portable speaker. It's got a cool kind of design to it, too. You can see that here. 20 hours of playtime, custom, two full-range, 45 millimeter drivers, and two passive radiators. Alright, plus a built-in speaker phone, if you wanna keep it on your desk and be a businessman, or a business, man. Kind of a cool package. I'm not sure where these guys came from. Was this a Kickstarter or something? I'm not a hundred, oh, nice package so far. Wow, that's actually, I kinda like that look right there. So there's the speaker. Little rubber on the bottom, volume buttons here, bluetooth indicator, and a power indicator as well. Now this is metal, this is made out of metal. A micro-USB port, that's gonna be to charge this guy up, an analog mini-jack port for connecting an analog audio source if you don't wanna use bluetooth, and then a full-size USB port, which I assume will be used to charge up another device, so if you wanna have your phone charging while it's transmitting audio too this speaker, you can do that, too. Oh, cool, alright, so it comes with not just a micro-USB cable, but a braided one that kind of matches. Look at that thing. Wow, that's, that's a tough cable, my friends. And then a power brick, pretty slim. Amplify your life, with some literal amps. This doesn't go in there, this is originally from there, this is a little keychain. You put that on your keychain because you're proud. Some stickers, too. So this is, this is for the superfans, the megafans, maybe you're one of them. I'm gonna save the little special feature, the magic trick, til the end. Let's hear this thing first. (beeping) So I'm gonna hold that, now I'm flashing. (beeping) That's right. Let's play some tunes. You can have all the features in the world, even secret ones, but if you don't sound right, you're out the door. (dancy, techno music) (slow, jazzy music) (upbeat, hip hop music) Is it the greatest bluetooth speaker I've ever heard? No, it is not the champion, but it's decent. Like, there's a little bit of low-end for something this size, so that's okay, I do really like the design, too. The aesthetic here is nice. So as a speaker, yeah, does the job. Best in the world? Probably not. But, it has a trick. This little guy lifts right up. Wait, Lewis, what are you doing? It's attached by a magnet or something, I like that. When it's in there, it's in there. This is the battery, right, I showed you that. Can you see those lights there, guy? It powers up this unit, but at the same time, the secret trick here is it's a 6,000 milliamp power battery, back-up battery, that you can just throw in your bag when you don't necessarily need your speaker. Now, assuming you keep your speaker powered up, this should always be charged. So you simply slip it out, and you're good to go, money in the bank. So, obviously, the micro-USB to charge it up, and then the full-sized USB to charge your device. So let's test that out. Definitely a magnet that holds it in there, look at that. And, charging, cool. I like these kinds of devices that do a couple of things. It's kind of like the Swiss Army Knife approach. Put it all in there, get it all in! Get yourself a hamburger and put all the toppings on! I'll take everything, plus the jalapenos, if you're Jack. I would probably use this in a bedroom somewhere, in a kitchen maybe, where you've got it plugged in. Most of the time, this is gonna be fully charged. Then, you're on your way out, you're on your way to school, oh, see you later. Two-in-one, transformer. 6,000 milliamp power powers your speaker, or anything else you want via the handy USB connection that is so important to our daily lifestyles. There you have it, SoundJump. Not bad. Next time on Unbox Therapy. Listen, I like wide angles, we're talking, this is a wide angle. You see me, wide angle. It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a wide angle lense.",

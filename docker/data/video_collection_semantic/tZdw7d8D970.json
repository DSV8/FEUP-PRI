    "transcript": "Hey what's going on everyone this is another I read a ridiculous Craigslist video and this one is a pretty bad not only is it extremely overpriced this person is asking an obscene amount of money for this PC but also it is misleading in more than one area so we're gonna dissect this I'm going to show you guys how to I can kind of sift through the BS right there's a lot of that especially on Craigslist so let's get started we'll look at why it's overpriced and then talk about some of the things that I know straight up are not true alright so this is the end I'll apologize it's pretty messy behind me I've actually filmed this exact video four times and each time I've had something else go wrong so first the mic wasn't working or it was kind of picking up in and out second the screen wasn't recording and the third time the mic was messed up again so I'm hoping fourth time's the charm also if you guys want some Pepsi action kitten sleeping right over there she's not really kidding anymore she's growing super fast anyway let's start with the title these are always pretty fantastic in all caps as usual fully built video editing PC plus 24 inch curved 4k screen I have my doubts about this we'll talk about it later and a gaming mouse and Kay which I assume is keyboard for a grand total of twenty seven hundred and fifty US dollars so this is the system it looks like a cyber PowerPC pre-built I mean it's branded as such so I would assume that it is but he says that he built it himself less than four months ago I mean you may have built it online dude but you didn't actually assemble anything that was a pre-built and it's called that for a reason so we have this system and I can't really tell you what all is you know comprising the system because he didn't include any system specs that's your first huge red flag someone asked this much money you put your system specs in the description to justify your asking price it's not down here so we're gonna be left to our own devices and this one is quote unquote convenient snapshot here of his system specs which only include his install to ram 32 gigs which is more than those people need in an i7 8700 k can't take that away from them best gaming cpu out there especially when overclocked but you know this puts just a small dent into his total asking price here now I actually asked you guys what this was on Twitter because I had no idea and again we have no information about the graphics card included so this is either a gtx 1070 or a 1080 gigabyte mini card and what gives it away is this unique little like wide it's just this small little party that has a back plate but that gives it away as a gigabyte card and it's only an 8 pin VGA power port here so this is either a 1070 or 1080 not a 1080i because that will have a minimum 8 plus 6 pin power config so I'm just gonna give them the benefit of the doubt here you're gonna get that quite a bit in this video and assume it's a 1080 because we really don't know any better you know this is his job and he didn't do it for us so we have to just guess and I'm not gonna dock him for it I'm gonna be the nice guy here and assume it's the 520 ish dollar gigabyte mini gt X 1080 something else that has me just questioning life is this right here this sentence this thing cost me over $3,200 all included and I know how much of a cut I'm taking but I need the money more than a paperweight at this time like dude come on like this is just this is such crap here I can't believe he even wrote that sentence and this this right here this price tag I'm calling BS on it I did tons of research into cyber PowerPC pre builds I couldn't find anything priced remotely close to $3,000 with the config that he has in here based on what we know they don't even sell a $3,200 system with a gtx 1080 like this one in it it just doesn't happen I don't know where he's getting these figures if he's just blatantly lying but the system has is did not cost him $3,200 I'll you know I'm as confident as that as I am with anything else so we have a similar system here that I found this is as close as I could find it is and it's 1979 bucks so that tells you about the bat how far off he is this comes with a you know i7 8700 K it comes with an AC prime z 370 comes with 16 gigs of ram you can add 16 more for about 200 bucks no problem it makes it $2,200 and then a gtx 1080 here the the other thing is this 960 gig 82 SSD like I don't see this in his build let's assume you have a 4 terabyte hard drive that's fine but a 960 gig SSD I don't I don't see that in this build here like he would have right I mean it would be in the picture it sits or you can see it barely but it sits right there on the far left SSD tray and that's not existent on this this picture is non-existent this build overall it's not sitting up front it's not sitting in the middle tray did he move it from this trade to behind the motherboard like what did he put it if he had won in the first place now I didn't notice this originally but there's an Intel obtained drive here so maybe he's just running an octane hard drive config in which case that means that this system is actually cheaper than what I've got aspect for here so I mean that's really all we can infer from his Craigslist post here I don't know why he even included this picture like dude nice Adobe suite like does that come with the pill door this is subscription-based as far as I know so you can't even you know you can't even include this stuff because you have to sign into your account so yeah whatever I mean 2750 OBO first-come first-serve okay buddy let me go ahead and build a system that's better than yours for cheaper than what you're asking for it so we have a PC part picker part list and I've pretty much kept all the specs that I could identify the same I've even included some better parts than his just to show you how big a ripoff this asking price actually is the first up we have the i7 8700 K for about 250 bucks on Amazon we have a 120 ml AO from coolermaster and that again falls in line with what he's got here this is some ASA tech looking pump from I guess it's like a cyber power brand but whatever we've had a better one in our system I assume MSI Z 370 a for about a hundred ten bucks solid overclocking motherboard g.skill floor x 32 gig kit this comes in 4 8 p egg modules and that's similar to what he's got here although his don't have heat sinks it's not gonna really affect the performance of the the modules it just more or less comes down to like right the price overall the build quality I'd say these modules are better than the ones he's got in his system 300 bucks that's not too bad considering how expensive ram used to be it's starting to come down a little I included Samsung 970 Evo this is better than the drive that he supposedly has in a system but even if we knock this out and just throw an op tain drive right it gets even worse but if we replace this with a 968 data drive like the one we just saw and obtain this is still gonna cost more than they config dit that he has so four terabytes of Western Digital blue goodness 100 bucks GeForce GTX 1080 from gigabyte this is the mini card for about 520 ish US dollars on Newegg you can ignore the rebate it doesn't really affect the end result here NZXT s340 elite same as the case depicted in this picture here we have an EVGA 600 watt 80 plus bronze PSU for about 40 bucks an outlet PC and I'm willing to bet this power supply is better than the one he's got in his system I mean look at these ugly blue connector points right on this power supply I think this is an afterthought and most pre builds from companies like this are gonna really cheap out on the power of supply is in the lower end stuff so just keep a look out right it's hard to tell and that's why they do this with power supplies because you're not gonna know what brand it is unless you actually tear open the PC which you can't do until you buy the system so yeah this is a place where many pre-built swil compromise and it's just up to you to do your due diligence and figure out what exactly is under the basement we have a Windows 10 home I included for just 20 bucks because you can get these on like kinguin you get them on LCD keys for way cheaper than the you know 100 or so US dollars that Microsoft's gonna charge you so these are usually just om keys and they'll be good for a build and that's what I use for all of my builds now we have a Samsung 4k 60 Hertz monitor and I'll talk about this for a second because 340 bucks here right for this but this monitor is not the same monitor as the one he's showing in the picture so let's assume he's selling this one I would assume that's the case because he's got the picture of it in his add this Samsung monitor doesn't come in a 4k config let alone a 24-inch size and curved at that Samsung as far as I know doesn't even make a 24-inch 4k monitor the PPI would be too high that Aaron Skeen 24 and 27 is pretty much negligible at this resolution and that's why they stick to a higher diagonal size so I did my best to search on Google to find something that was I don't know as close to what he's saying he has as possible and this is it I mean this is basically his monitor it's got the same curved base it's got the curved panel and this one if we scroll down to the system specs is a 1920 by 1080 panel so it's a 1080p panel I'm not even sure what the refresh rate is and they're not showing it on here as far as I know so it's probably 60 Hertz if it was anything higher than that I'm sure they would advertise it up top that's what retailers do they don't want to be misleading and that's kind of how they make sales sometimes right so this is 180 bucks this is half the price of the one we've got a bucket here but I'm gonna give him the benefit of the doubt again just because I don't know I mean he for all I know he's he's lying here okay that's what I think he's doing because I haven't found this panel unless he got it from some weird person who replaced the panel's and somehow made this one curve in the 4k resolution and this diagonal sighs it doesn't exist and he's trying to con whoever's buying this and I mean unless you get really close to the display you're not gonna know it's not 4k anyway so yeah I think he's trying to [ __ ] you and then I got a Corsair k55 wired gaming keyboard for about 50 bucks and a Logitech g600 2 wireless optical mouse these aren't you know the best for gaming but they're better more than likely than what he's got here these are just like generic CyberPower PC branded peripherals this is the cheaper gaming mouse and this I'm pretty sure isn't even a mechanical keyboard so there we've done our due diligence thoroughly and our grand total is just under $2,200 which is a thousand dollars less than what he's saying he paid for this system four months ago and is still 500 and you know some change dollars less than what he wants to sell it for and now so yeah I'm calling BS on this one I think he's just trying to pull somebody's leg and take more money for the system than he actually paid for it up front let me know what you guys think in the comments below so that's a wrap for this one I hope you guys don't think I was being too harsh on this person again I've tried to keep things as anonymous as possible if you do happen to find the ad do not harass this person that is not the point of the video again it is to inform you guys of the garbage out there how to properly sift through it if you still want to entertain this person then you could you know send a full-on pc port picker list and say hey i could pull this exact system for a lot less would you be willing to take is slightly lower than retail for your build and if that person says no move on there are plenty of other options out there I doubt this person will sell this build for this much although I have overestimated human capacities in the past and I'm sure somebody who has no idea what he or she is doing might see this and say oh looks really cool might be worth twenty seven fifty that's a ridiculous price anyway let me know what you guys think in the comments below I hope this video was at least entertaining but I do want to stress again the informative sections of these videos you guys can learn from this stuff especially if you want to jump into the use market and I see what's a good deal what's a bad deal we tend to emphasize the bad deals because there are a lot of them out there and you guys tend to like those but we do have a few I read videos out there with good as included so you get an idea of what you know use parts are worth that's the hardest thing I think to do in the use market is to put a price tag on something that is not new so again thumbs up if you like the video this lega to feel the complete opposite if you hate everything about lighting

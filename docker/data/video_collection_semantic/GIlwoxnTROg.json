    "transcript": "- Here it is. It's the Apple Watch Series 7. (upbeat music) It has a larger display, a new case shape with softer rounded edges, a brighter screen, more durable front crystal, more resistant to dust, and optimized user interface for increased readability, faster charging, and all new aluminum colors. All right, so, I unboxed this while I was visiting my family, and I didn't have a light. I barely had any equipment to make the videos. So, I tried the best that I could, but I wish that I was filming my reaction when I would have actually opened this thing out, because the most shocking thing is the color that I received for my review unit is the new green aluminum. It has like this really nice kind of hint of green, and it's dark enough that I feel like you'll be able to mix this with various different color bands, and there won't be this huge contrast in color mix up, because it is green. It's sort of a soft and subtle hint of green, and I am actually very surprised how much I like this color. Now, for my personal watch, I did choose the starlight color, but this is green is actually quite surprising. So, I've been using this watch for about a week now, and I haven't really been filming many workouts, or doing that much stuff, 'cause I think that I may have injured my knee. About to go on my first one with the new Apple Watch. I'm very excited. It's a little chilly. (bright music) Oh no. I'm not even a mile in, and sometimes hills bother my knee, and I almost gave out running down this hill. So, I now have to take it a little bit easier, 'cause I was ready to push through it. I was ready to really break some records today. Not today. So, the thing that really surprised me about this watch was this leather link band. Now, this is about a-year-old. These came out last year, but for some reason I never checked out this watch band, and it is honestly, really, really cool. It's a very light kind of leather material, and it's magnetic. So, it just all instantly clasps itself together, just like that. And as you guys can see in this lighting, you can tell that this aluminum case has that green hint, especially with this watch band, 'cause it really does accent that green color. I'm just upset because it took me a year to find out about this watch bands. So, if this is a watch band that you haven't tried yet, I definitely recommend it. So, one of the questions that so many people have been asking, and a lot of people have been talking about all over the internet is if I have a Series 6, should I upgrade to the Series 7? And honestly, if you have some extra cash, and this is something that you wanna spend your money on, yeah, go for it. Because the bigger display, and the new optimized interface is pretty significant, especially if you're going from something that is previous to a Series 6, or if you've never had an apple watch before, this is it. Now, before we get more into this watch, let's take a quick walk down Apple Watch history lane to see where we started at, and where we are now. (bright music) The first Apple Watch was released in 2015, and has been referred to as the Series 0. This shipped without GPS or cellular, but it did have a built-in heart rate sensor. The second generation had two models. The Series 1 was available only in aluminum, starting at a lower price with no GPS or water resistance, unlike the Series 2, which was the first version to introduce GPS tracking, with water resistance of 50 meters, and the ability to track laps and distance during swimming workouts. It also had a brighter display, and it came in aluminum, stainless steel, and ceramic. In 2017, we had the Series 3 with a faster processor, Bluetooth 4.2, a built-in altimeter, increased RAM, and was the first version with LTE for an always connected watch. Series 4 has a much larger display with thinner bezels, and a newly redesigned ceramic back. This was also the first watch that introduced ECG and full tact. This is where I feel like Apple really started getting serious about the health tracking, allowing anyone to take an electrocardiogram right on the wrist at any time. In 2019, the Series 5 brought us the always on low power display, a compass, doubled the storage, and brought back the ceramic model, and two new titanium models. In 2020, we got both the Series 6 and a lower cost SE model. The Series 6 has blood O2 tracking, a new faster processor, a brighter display, always on altimeter, and the ability to connect to 5G WiFi. This also includes the new third gen optical heart rate sensor. The SE was a much lower cost model that has the always on altimeter, but it does have the older processor, and a second gen optical heart rate sensor with no ECG, blood O2, or the always on display. Continuing to improve the battery life and fitness tracking with each generation, the Series 6 has by far been my favorite iterations since it's launch. So, I am so excited to see this updated, refreshed version of this in the 7. This larger, always on, retina display has about 20% more screen area than the 6, and over 50% more screen area than the Series 3. It has a new refined shape with these softer edges, and this front crystal now bends light from the screen around the edges for the subtle wraparound effect. Now, with this larger display, you'll be able to take advantage of the optimized UI, with larger text buttons, and everything overall is so much legible. There's also a new text input with a full keyboard and the ability to use Quick Path, where you swipe along the keyboard to form words. I do actually use Quick Path a lot when I'm typing on my iPhone, but most of the time from the apple watch, I just use my voice, and dictate ,and hit send. Now, much like previous Apple Watches, we have some new watch faces that are exclusive to the 7. This is contour, and this wraps all around the new display, and around the edges. The numbers also increase in size on the hour, and of course, like all the other watch faces, you can change the color, but this one is set to green to match the Apple Watch. This is the modular duo, which gives you two large complication, and this world type really takes advantage of the larger display, showcasing so much information for all of these timezones all at once. The entire charging system for Series 7 has also been redesigned to accommodate faster charging with this new magnetic fast USB-C cable. Now, you can still use older chargers, but you won't get the full fast charge capabilities unless you use this new one. You'll be able to tell the old and new chargers apart, because the new fast charger has this aluminum outer ring. It'll take just 45 minutes to charge from 0-80%, and in just eight minutes of charging, that'll be enough for eight hours of sleep tracking. I am really sad though, because I love the MagSafe duo, and I won't be able to get the fast charging if I'm using that for both my phone and my watch. But honestly, I haven't had a single problem with battery life on my Series 6 in the past year. So, I'm not really that worried about it. As for colors this year in the Series 7, there are five, all new aluminum colors. There's midnight, starlight, the green that you've seen throughout this video, blue, and product red. So, for my personal one, I chose starlight, and I also got an abundance of cables. Cables? No, these are watch bands. I am so obsessed with this leather link. I can't believe that I've missed out on a whole year of this incredible watch band. Now, I also got the solo loop chalk color. So, basically what happens two combinations of my wallet and phone combo. This is the new Clover watch band. I put it on my old watch. I wanna open up this other color leather link, and see how this looks on the green, 'cause that was my biggest concern, is if I got the green, how would it look mixed and matched with other colors? Leather link, you are a sleeper hit. And why did nobody tell me about how cool this was? Oh, that plum is gonna actually look very good on this. Oh my God. A little duo, a little two-tone action. Oh yeah. Look at that. A nice little mix and match. Let's check out this new braided solo loop. Look at you. (papers ruffling) Man, I love Apple Watch bands. It's just so. It's just like such a fun little accessory. Oh, Jenna is asking me if, do we hate this? No, we love it. Oh, look at that. Oh my God. I did it. Send. And so, we can make that text size like I have it at the smallest possible, but like, look, look how big this could be. In all seriousness though, I do like the sweater. And I'm a huge benefit to having the Apple Watch is you'll have access to Apple Fitness+, and this is something that I've talked about a lot, and I love Apple Fitness+. I love the instructors, I love the classes, I love the way that the Apple Watch integrates into the classes. You're able to see all of your metrics that just pops up right there in Apple Fitness. You can use Apple TV, you can do it on your iPhone, you can do on your iPad, and I've been using it a lot to do workouts on my iPad. And over the past week, when I got this apple watch, I was in Maryland with my family on a little mini getaway vacation in a little cabin in the middle of the woods. I would have filmed more there, but I think I hurt my knee, and I basically was just kind of resting the whole trip. I did a few runs, testing out the watch and I was like, I think that I may be injured. So, I went back inside, watched squid game, and ate ice cream. (bright music) But going back to Apple Fitness, they have so many different classes. Even though I wasn't feeling up to doing some intense running, they have so many classes that I was like, okay, I'm gonna find some low impact classes. I can do some yoga. I can do some stretching. And there's so many things that like the apple watch has, like these hidden little gems. They even have this time to walk. And this is something that I never really talked about in a video, but it's really cool. They have this wide array of basically like podcast style talks that they have with various different people, and you can browse their entire library. You can listen to a couple of these. Oh, like Nick Jonas, Jane Fonda, John Chu. Need to download them and go for a walk. It's cool 'cause you can download them from the cloud. So, you'll be able to just listen to them directly off of your watch. Again, Fitness+, huge fan. Love the way that it integrates with the Apple Watch. And it's just such a great thing, because while I was traveling, I obviously didn't have a Peloton treadmill with me. I also didn't have any weights or anything. All I had was my Apple Watch and my iPad, and I was able to still get a good workout, even with my minor injury, which now a week later, it's feeling much better. I did want to show you guys the watch face that I do normally use, blood oxygen, which I do like to check frequently, and this middle bar is the heart rate data throughout the day, which is kind of cool because I can see like I did not work out today. So, my heart rate did not even go above 89, which is pretty sub par, but I can see like my highest and lowest heart rate. So, my lowest heart rate was 47, and I have access to my messages. I can see my activity rings and be able to start a workout. But with the Apple Watch, everything is stored inside of the fitness app, and this is where you can also find Fitness+, which like I said, gives you access to all sorts of workouts. Another new thing that Apple Fitness+ just recently launched is meditation. So, now they have some new guided meditations. It's cool because they do give you an option to watch the trainers as they're leading you in the meditation, or you can do it with audio only in their new Mindfulness app. So, you can do the audio meditations, and even give you an option to reflect, to breathe. I'm sure if you used an Apple Watch long enough, you've definitely got the notifications to take some time to breathe. Even a minute of deep breathing can calm you. And usually it happens at the time where I am the least calm, and the last thing that I want to do is breathe or be calm. So then, I get even more fired up 'cause I'm like, I know that what you're telling me is right, and I should do it, and what do I do? 85% of the time I just click out of it. And then those few times that I do take the minute to breath, I'm like, wow, I feel so much better. I feel like that's kind of applicable to like, why didn't I listen to my parents when they told me it's something a long time ago? Until you figure it out for yourself, or learn the hard way, you just don't learn, do you? I just love they also have a lot of programs and stuff for beginners. So, you have meditations for beginners, and they also have this new thing that is getting you ready for various activities. So, the new one is, Get Ready for Snow Season. So, these are activities geared specifically towards skiing. We've got workouts for beginners, workouts for older adults, workouts for pregnancy. So, they definitely have a wide array of things. And again, Fitness+ is really only a-year-old. So, it's kind of cool to see how far it's evolved to where it is now, and it really makes me excited to see what they do in the future. Some of the things that I like about the Apple Watch is the competitions. This isn't a new feature, but it is really fun to send these friendly competition requests to your friends. Let's see. Let's send Jenna a competition. Okay. The fact that she has 22 wins, and I only have three, that's pathetic. Huh. All right. To be fair, sometimes I can't track a lot of my workouts, because I don't like to wear my Apple Watch when I do jujitsu or knife training. I am. So, that's my excuse and I'm sticking to it. So, a sleep tracking to me is very important. I just recently got an aura ring, which a lot of you guys have been asking about this ring that I've been wearing. You're like, what happened? Is there something that you're not telling us? Actually, yeah. There is something I'm not telling you. I wasn't telling you that I've been tracking my sleep for the past couple of months. There. I'm really glad that I can get that out in the open, and now you guys all know my secret. So, I haven't really talked to you guys about this, but I am working on a full video to kind of give you some more information about it. This gives you a lot of very similar information, but it also does track your temperature. So, it will be tracking your temperature throughout the night. It tracks your movement. It tracks your breathing rate, your heart rate, and it really gives you this comprehensive list of how your sleep actually went. It gives you tips on things that you could have done better. It also gives you access to your readiness. So, this uses things like your resting heart rate, body temperature, HRV balance, and your recovery, how much you slept last night, all of these little factors to determine how well you're rested and ready for training. Now, I've really been into tracking my sleep on the ring is because it is so small and light. It doesn't even feel like I'm wearing anything. But the way that I sleep is usually I sleep on my stomach, and this is the hand that usually is like sort of close to my face. So, I end up sleeping on my Apple Watch instead of like my hand, and it's not very comfortable. But for me, I much rather prefer wearing this tiny, small little ring to sleep, but that's not to say that these two things don't go so incredibly well together. Because I use the Apple Watch to track all of my fitness, that only enhances the aura ring significantly, because you're getting all of this accurate heart rate data, this fitness tracking that the ring doesn't do. So I do feel like this is such a perfect combo, especially if you're training for various things. This really does kind of give you the hard, true facts, and data of how well you slept, how much you recovered, and what you may need to do to improve for your next night's sleep. This was just a first look at the Apple Watch Series 7. I have absolutely been loving it. As somebody who is a huge Apple Watch fan, it's been great. The display has made such a huge difference. I've also noticed the display is brighter, but after using it the past week, it kind of just seems normal now. So, I don't even remember what it was like before. It still does look very similar. I feel like if a lot of people were to put these up side by side, I think a normal everyday person may not be able to tell, but for those who may be Apple Watch obsessed, there is a good chance that you will be able to notice some of the subtle differences and be like, yep, there it is. That's the Series 7. I hope you guys enjoyed this video. If you did, be sure to give it a thumbs up, and make sure you subscribe so you'll be notified when I post new videos. Hit the bell, leave me some comments, and I will see you guys in the next video. (bright music)",

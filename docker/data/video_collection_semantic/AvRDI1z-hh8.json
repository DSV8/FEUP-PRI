    "transcript": "in a recent video i put the gtx 1650 against an rx 6400 to see which would claim the title of the world's most powerful low profile graphics card which was a silly thing to do because neither of them are even close no this is the most powerful low profile graphics card in the world and today we're gonna see just how mighty this little beast is but before we open the box it's time for a quick word from today's video sponsor that helped pay for this surprisingly expensive little graphics card today's video sponsor is back due to popular demand and it's none other than lenode lenode is a linux based cloud computing and web hosting service that offers multiple products to manage cloud storage websites databases game servers kubernetes and they can even handle whatever computational load you can imagine also if you value good customer support which you should lenode is one of the best in the business i mean look at how happy these two are with their service if all of this sounds good to you sign up to lenode using the link in my description below to get a 60 day hundred dollar free credit thank you lenode for sponsoring today's video well you definitely don't pay for the fanciness of the box whoa that is some shockingly basic packaging they just cellophaned the graphics card to some cardboard like a bit of grocery store meat okay so we've got a full length rear i o bracket some rtx quick start guides which hints at the performance of this thing and then a whole bunch of little bit of full-size displayport adapters but with that let's d-meet-nappy the graphics card and have a closer look so it looks like you can just kind of pop it open like that and then you just kind of slide it out like that and almost drop it it's so cute this kawaii little graphics card is the nvidia quadro rtx a2000 and considering its endowment of rt cores in 12 gigs of video memory this low profile powerhouse should embarrass the likes of an rx 6400 which you really hope it would considering that it costs an eye-watering 750 us dollars now it says here remove film before use so there's a nice peel in coming hopefully let's see okay there we go oh now considering that this cost as much as a reasonably sized starter home the construction is a lot crappier than i was expecting where's all the adamantium at what the hell i mean even the shroud on the infinitely cheaper rx 6400s made of metal and it's the terrible xfx version and it instantly got disgusting look at that what the hell and then the next thing that i notice about the a2000 is that it doesn't have a supplemental power connection which means this is an extremely efficient gpu i cannot wait to see how this thing performs now i'm gonna use this system to test the little meet nappy graphics card this is the one i built in that amazing aliexpress case uh we've got a i think this is an i-512 600k in here we've got a whole bunch of ddr5 and all of the rgb now the rear pcie brackets actually held on by hex screws which i guess because it's a pro graphics card you need to be inconvenienced by the screw bit you need to use for it and you actually need two different sizes of bit uh down here we have a tr6 screw and this one's a bit bigger i think it's a tr7 or tr8 and when you turn it around to the back you can see we have some more hex screws oh nice it's one of those fan connectors that always breaks i really like those oh look at that heatsink it's like really textured on the side that's very interesting and then there's also quite a big bit of contact plate which i'm guessing is touching the memory under there we've also got the power delivery under here which is not particularly beefy but it doesn't really need to be because this card doesn't have a very high ddp as we'll see later in the video and then back here we have our four mini displayport connectors which is an awesome way to get a whole bunch of video outs on a very skinny little pcb um oh there really doesn't feel like there's a way to do this without destroying a unusually expensive little graphics card it's just oh i don't like that oh someone's coming loose oh oh there we go oh and now we're just left with a skinny little pcb and quite a huge die for a low profile graphics card this is what an rx 6400 die looks like in comparison now the reason that it's so big is because it's based on the ga106 die which is the same die in the 3050 and 3060 but it's just a slightly different hardware configuration than those two so that it can work without any supplemental power and this is actually the 12 gig version of the a2000 which means this graphics card has three times as much gddr6 in it as either the gtx 1650 or the rx 6400 it also uses a pretty big 192-bit memory bus as opposed to the 64-bit bus on the rx-6400 so yeah generally just a very interesting gpu but anyway with that let's try gaming on this graphics card that really wasn't designed with that in mind now here we're running gta 5 at 1080p very high settings and we're getting a very solid gaming experience for gta 5 that frame graph is smooth as a baby's bottom which you can really feel in game and look at the power draw as a total this system is using just over 120 watts of power and it's giving us a gaming experience like this that's honestly really impressive that's really crazy uh let's try a more demanding game um what this is battlefield 5 running at 1080p high settings and we've barely dipped below 120 frames per second which is absolutely ridiculous when you look at the power draw it's under 70 watts and again that frame graph is so smooth this is running in directx 12 which with battlefield 5 is usually a stuttery mess that's really cool nice even cyberpunk is averaging a solid 60 frames per second here now this is a 1080p medium settings but still that is that is very very good performance and just look at that frame graph all of the games run so smoothly and consistently now before we try some ray tracing and do lesser graphics card humiliation with the a2000 i just want to see how it holds up to some overclocking okay so that's interesting the graphics card very much does its own thing in terms of overclocking so i've been gradually pulling the slider up and going from plus 200 to plus 300 has done basically nothing to the core frequency and it's because the graphics card is regulating that by itself which actually kind of makes this the easiest graphics card ever to overclock but we're definitely getting a higher frame rate so uh yeah let's do a benchmark and see how much more performance we get damn considering that just involved pulling two sliders that is a considerable performance improvement now here we've got cyberpunk running at 1080p medium settings and i've actually left the graphics card overclocked uh just to give it a better fighting chance with ray tracing so let's just enable it and see what what happens turn on some ray tracing wow that's slowed down quite a lot but yeah okay that's actually kind of running about as well as i was expecting usually just turning ray tracing on just kind of cut your frame rate in half let's turn the other ray tracing stuff on yeah that's not going too great although luckily because this is an rtx uh we do have dlss available as an option balanced wow that's made it made a very big difference okay so with dlss balanced and medium ray tracing it's actually running very well look at that now balanced actually looks pretty good although the small details like these kind of pin stripes on the back of the car uh are a bit faded although again with ray tracing i don't ever feel like it's worth it turning it on uh let's actually turn ray tracing off i don't know i i i kind of struggle to see the difference between the two although with dlss running uh and no ray tracing look at that frame rate we're getting over a hundred frames per second and again we're doing all of that with less than 70 watts of power draw this graphics card is incredibly efficient so we've pretty much got the settings cranked now and we even have psycho ray tracing on with balanced dlss oh milf car oh i parked right next to milf guard that was that was my bad my bad let's just drive over here we are still getting above 40 frames per second what happens if we just do quality the rss now with quality dlss it's a teeny bit sharper and uh it's still running above 30 frames per second with all of the settings cranked what magic lives in this graphics card to make it be this powerful and just have it barely use any power and on that note let's compare it to a not obscenely expensive low profile graphics card so clearly the a2000 eats other low profile graphics cards as a nutritious midday snack but considering that i could have bought an rtx 3080 for the amount i paid for the a2000 it may be the most interesting graphics card on sale at the moment in my opinion it's just impossible to justify buying one at least until nvidia launches a gaming focused version of this card without ecc memory for less than half the price nvidia maybe please you",

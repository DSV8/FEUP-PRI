    "transcript": "- Jenna, do you know what we're doing today? - What? - We are going to be exploring a bunch of really incredible AirPods cases. Have you heard of this kind of phenomenon that's happening? Or has already happened, and I'm late to the trend. - I actually have not, but you've been talking about it for at least three weeks now, so I guess I have heard about it. - She's heard about it, and now we're going to show you guys some AirPods cases. When you think about AirPods cases, what do you think about, Jenna? - I mean, like, a normal case for your AirPods, like simple. Like little, small, put your AirPods in, protects it. This is the opposite. - Complete opposite of that. I have about, like, 35, 36 of these that I ordered off Amazon. I'm not even sure if they all ended up coming in, but that's a steak. Avocado. Yoda. Starbucks. And how are they getting away with this? I'm not sure. These all, I think, came from China. They're some kind of crazy knockoff. But either way, lets unbag these and test them out on our AirPods. - I have so many questions. You know you can just go like that, right? - Oh. - They have a... - Oh. - You can do whatever you want. Who am I to judge? - I will. (upbeat music) Okay, so we'll each take a turn. Which one is your, I guess, favorite or least favorite? - Least favorite? How many am I allowed to pick? Well, my favorite, I think, so far, I really enjoyed this little Xbox controller. - [Justine] Oh! There's another Xbox controller for the old AirPods. - This is for the new AirPods. - Okay. So you put yours in there. I'll put mine in here. - So I stick it in there? Like this? And then I just do, like that? - Yeah. - Oh, it's like it has a little hat. This is heavy. - That's heavy, feel how heavy that is. - Not as heavy as mine. - It's pretty heavy. - I feel like this would, actually, I feel like I would lose my AirPods. - This stinks. - I feel like, if anything, this would fly open and then my AirPods-- - That stinks. - Yeah, it smells like plastic and chemicals. What is this? - Oh! That's a Starbucks bag. - But that's not like any-- - For like a breakfast sandwich. - Oh. - [Justine] You know, like when they give you, like a-- - Like a spinach feta wrap? - Next. Look how freaking cute this is. It's a little dog. - Oh that is cute! Does it have a little hat? - Yes! Look at this little, tiny dog! Oh my gosh. - [Jenna] You would never suspect those are AirPods. - Absolutely not. Oh, his hat fell off. Okay, well. It doesn't quite work that well. This is probably my favorite, like this is super cute. - Have you not seen Toad? - I have seen Toad, I ordered all of these. - Look at little Toad! His little mushroom head. - [Justine] Oh my goodness! I'm just not sure how they're getting around copyright. Look at this one. This one's a Starbucks one! Stinks. - This literally says Nintendo Switch. - I know! I just-- - I like this one. - Don't know if, like, these are really that practical. - No, absolutely not. - Because it's not really well made, like the one that we have from NOMAD is really nice. It's like a nice leather case, it's super slick. These also were very inexpensive. - Well, I was just going to say, how much did they cost? Like, four dollars apiece? - Like, some were like three dollars. - Yeah. - This one's nice. It's a very low profile. Definitely doesn't fit very well on there. Or maybe I put it the wrong way? Did I put it the wrong way? Doesn't really fit very well. I can't believe how bad these smell. - (laughs) They smell so bad. It's actually giving me a headache from the chemicals and the plastic smell. - It's hurting my throat, actually. - Yeah. - It's a weird thing. So, this one that I'm going to open now, this was the most expensive one. It is a knockoff Louis! - Oh, shopping! That's not even the new AirPods. - It's not. - [Jenna] So it should've been on sale. - And the quality is very subpar. (gasps) Okay, actually, this is quite nice. - Here. Oh, what is-- - This is actually really nice! - How much did this cost? - Maybe $38. - Oh my goodness! - I know. Expensive. - Tyler, I'm sorry I raised my voice because I was disgusted by the price. - Yeah, but, this actually is perfect because I has this nice little clip on it, and it stays in there. Aww. Actually, it doesn't stay in there that great 'cause as soon as you open this, the whole thing pulls out. - I hate when that happens. - Oh my god. This is really, this is a lot of trash. Look at this one, this is a cheeseburger. Look at this! (hums happily) Little sesame seeds. - Is this Yoda? - (gasps) That is Yoda! Oh my gosh, you haven't watched Mandalorian, have you? - I haven't, no. I've been watching everything else on every other network, though. - I love The Mandalorian, the show was incredible. The finale was, there was a very upsetting part for me that I'm still traumatized from. - Cute! - [Justine] Cute! Boy, where do we go from here, is the problem? Oh, an avocado, you say? This is a smiling avocado. All right! - Okay, well um-- - Since we've been talking a lot about like, you know, the highering quality of these things-- (bell jingles) Okay, well, that's not really that high qua-- (bell jingles) What is that? - So I'm not sure because, is, does that go with something? Does it go with this one? (toy squeaking) - In what world would I want a squeak toy on my freaking key chain? - Do we think Matty's gonna come upstairs? Let's see if Matty comes up. (toy squeaking) - Okay, I hate it. So, we're going to put this little unicorn on. This is really cool. Really, really cool. Hold on, I've gotta clip this onto here. - No! You clip that onto there? - Yeah. - Yes. - Look at all that crap you're going to lose. - Has anybody seen my AirPods? Where's my AirPods? Are these my AirPods? Are these my-- What the heck? This so, this is, this is stupid. It's stupid, but it actually is kind of cute, so I'm kind of conflicted. Like, I don't know if I hate it or love it. - Why do you need a bell? - I don't know. Okay. Next. What are you, you're interested in some meat? - Oh! The meat! If I ever saw someone in real life get their AirPods out of a steak AirPods case, I would call the police. (laughs loudly) It's a crime. - Picture this, I'm at the gym, ready to go on a little jog. I'm like ugh, I need to get my Air Pods out. - 911, I would like to commit a crime. (laughs) This woman's case is hideous. - Is that? Is that? What's that egg character? He has a name. - Does he have a hat? - Yeah, it's right here. - Oh, there it is. - What is that called? Get out of here. - Oh shoot, wait, his bottom! I have peeled him. - Oh, he's a layered boy. - That's interesting, but, I feel like that's just more layers to lose. Uh, oh. I have to sneeze. - Let me see this. - (sneezes) Oh god. (both laughing) I have fallen off the stool. - Jenna has fallen. What is this egg character called? Leave me a comment below, I know you guys know. None of these even line up right, like, they're just weird, and... I don't even know how we transition from that to this, crystal goodness. Have you seen anything more beautiful? Oh my god, I'm never going to get this out of there. (gasps) - No you're not. Oh, wait! This also went with the little egg guy. Oh. - Wow, and there's even a little cutout for the light. - Is this, what is this? Is this a cookie? - I'm so furious! I can't get this freaking thing out of here. - And this goes in here, this goes like this! It's so cute! Beep! - [Justine] I'm freaking mad. - Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep! Oh! I touched it with my mouth! - Eww. That looks so cute! I love that is has a-- - Look, it has a mini! - That's cute. That's super cute. - Don't touch it to your mouth. Because it's just a bad idea. - God, that smells so bad. Okay, next up! - This is fun. - What about this? Look at this beautiful, rose gold... masterpiece? If you will? - It's a gem. - Beautiful. Rose gold masterpiece. It also has this amazing little... thing. - Definitely looks better on camera than real life. - You think? - Yeah. Looks so shiny and-- - What do you have over there? - Oh my goodness! Well, I have-- - Mike! Put Mike together. (hums) - Boom. - [Justine] It's pretty cool. Oh that's pretty cool. I'm into it. - It's really cute. Definitely wouldn't be something that I would get, actively choose to have as my case, though. - No. So this one, is dirty inside. But I guess it's fitting, because. - It's a pig. - It's a pig, so I'm gonna put my pods in there, anyway. Oh, now my pods are dirty! Dirty pod. All right, here we go. Oh yeah, look at that. Look at this pig! Oh wow, he's so cute. Is this fitting for my personality? - That's actually pretty cute. - Jenna walked in my house today, and was like \"you're disgusting.\" - I go, \"this is gross.\" - My house is such a mess. - There was just stuff everywhere. - We've got a few more left. I'm saving the best for last. And it's not this one. Actually, that might be pretty good. - Hmm. It's pretty good. - Is this the Haagen-Dazs one? - So when I saw that at first, from the side, I thought that was ketchup, so when it said vanilla, I was confused. - Oh, no. Put our ice cream top on. - I'm really bad at putting this on. It's cute. Have you ever had the chocolate peanut butter Haagen-Dazs? Oh my gosh. - No, but that sounds so good. I can't believe some of these. Like, who really rolls around town with some of these on? Some of them are cool. Some are just, a real... - A crime. They're a crime. - Crime! They really are a crime. Okay, I have the best for last. I have saved it. (sings excitedly) It is the poop emoji case! I mean this is beautiful. It opens nicely. It's smiling at me. Absolutely not a low profile. This could not be any more obnoxious. - This is a poop ring. You could wear that as jewelry! - Oh, you're right. - [Jenna] How does that work? Oh, it's too big, but I understand. - It's a little big. I'm sad. But this is nice. - Huh. - I can't believe... - I guess-- - This. - I don't know. I don't know how I feel. - I think it's a really cute accessory, you know, if you wanna try to be an individual. Be unique. - This is my favorite. - The Toad one is pretty nice. - Toad is the best. - Some of them don't really stay on very well, (laughs) like this just pops right off so easily. Look, if you put this in your bag, you're gonna lose it. Well that's it. I guess I'll put some links in the description, if you guys are interested - No! - in any of these? I don't think I recommend buying them. I mean, if you maybe buy one? Don't buy more than that. At all. Don't do it. - No. Save your money. I tried to tell her to save her money, and I was offended when she told me how many she bought. (sighs) I have anxiety now. What are you gonna do with all of these? - I don't know. Well, guys, thanks for watching. Happy New Year, if I haven't told you already. What am I gonna do with these? I can't return them. (relaxed hiphop music)",

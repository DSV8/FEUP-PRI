    "transcript": "- We're gonna try crappy Instagram ads so you don't have too. - Wait, are they crappy? - I don't know, maybe. - Did you get anything good? - So, these are real ads that I got fed, over the course of a few weeks and I bought every ad that was sent to me. - Well, I can tell you that your first purchase was a sound one. (Austin laughs) - So this magic carp hat, that's it. That's..it's a magic carp hat. - I'm so happy right now. I'm so happy. I mean, this looks like a legitimate, authentic product. It is quite high quality and I will proceed to wear this for the rest of the video. - That's why I put it first. Do you have an idea how much this cost us? - I don't know. Was it $29.99? - It was twenty-seven plus thirteen shipping. - They got you on the shipping. forty bucks, for this style? What more could you ask for? - That, that type of drip you'd be making a real splash. (splashing) - The problem with getting these targeted ads on Instagram, is as soon as you buy one type of something it thinks you want a whole bunch of those. - Are there Pokemon cards in the box? - There's no Pokemon cards in the box. - Oh, I don't care then. - But I did find, I think that \"This Is\" needs a new mascot. We have Roboraptor X, but no one really likes Roboraptor X. - No. - So that's why I present to you. - Matt. I don't like this. What is, what is this? - Might I introduce you guys to Greg the Zombie, AKA Rick. The beautiful thing about him is if you're reaching. - Oh no, oh no. (squishing) - You can just kind of there. - Oh, it's heart. - It's the heart. - Oh, good lord. - Oh, cat got your tongue? But you know what else the cats got? (squishing) - Get your filthy hands out of Greg! - Here, just go ahead and grab, grab that. (Austin laughs) (squishing) (Matt laughs) - It just keeps going! - How much is in here? (Matt laughs) - Oh my goodness! - He is deep. Feel go here. - Do you want me to go deep? - Yeah, go deep into Greg. Look at this here. - Wow - Well, let's turn that around. Just if you could just, - What am I doing? OW! AH! - This guy's fun, but the fun doesn't end there. - It doesn't end here? - What zombie is not complete without his brains? So his eyes just kind of go whoop. - Yeah? - If you pop him, AH! (Matt laughs) - Matt, do you think your brain is this big? - No! I know yours isn't. - He's eating his own guts again. (gargling) - Greg the Zombie I can get on board with is the new \"This Is\" mascot. - How much did we pay for Greg the Zombie? - Sixty five dollars - I'm gonna leave one eye in, because I think he looks funnier that way. - I'm pretty sure that brain is upside down. - You're upside down Matt. - This video is sponsored by Govee Glide's Hexa Light RGBIC Control. That might sound like a mouthful Matt, but you know what you can get? You can get a beautiful array of 10 panels across your bedroom, your living room, your streaming room and you can add some real style to your house. - You can add up to twenty-five of these panels, and individually control each side of the panels, to create whatever patterns, colors, whatever you want for it. - The cool thing about the Govee Glide Hexa Pro's is that it's all controlled through the app. And you can even use some voice assistance. That's really neat to be able to control everything from one spot and get the full RGBIC control of your dreams. - It's super simple to install, there's no tools required and they can be arranged pretty much however you want on the wall. - All you do is go check them out at the link in the description. - Look, if you wanna become the next ninja go and get the Govee Glid Hexa Pro's. - I don't think we can quite promise that, but what we can promise you is an incredibly stylish setup. If you go check out the link of the description and BKA thank you to Govee for sponsoring this episode. Your future streaming career is not necessarily guaranteed. - I guarantee it. - Sometimes you and your significant other, you guys want to cuddle in for a night with Greg the Zombie. - Sure - But maybe you want some company. So - This is the love button? - The love button is definitely probably required for this guy. - Oh no. - Or should I say gal? - Matt? Is this what I think it is? (Matt laughs) - Matt? Do we need to censor this? - Yeah. Comes with leggings. You do need to dress it. - Wait, let's look it on the camera. Watch it jiggle. - Can you please put pants on this? - It smells weird. - This company single handedly, - You smelled the butt? Stop smelling the butt! (dramatic music) - Tips and tricks for the Buttress Pillow. Lay on the Buttress with your head cradled between the thighs and beneath the cheeks. AKA the sweet spot. Are you? - Okay, I'm lying there. - Take care of the butt and give her care and attention. Would it help if we, if we labeled this as Austin? - Yeah. - This is actually a mold of your butt. - I am this thick. I can confirm. - For all slappers, squeezers, nappers and face buriers, lounge on the couch, support your back while watching TV, gaming and beyond. Look, you guys don't even need a girlfriend anymore. The yoga pants are machine washable, to keep her smelling nice and scented. - Can, can we stop with that? - It did come with a couple extras. A sticker that says \"We heart butts\" - Okay. I can get down with that sticker. Everyone likes a good butt. (Matt laughs) - Sometimes you don't wanna, just cuddle with roughly one fifth of a person. We got you covered there too. - Can I just say that this video has immediately started out maximum sauce? - So while this is your surrogate girlfriend, (slapping) - Bad Matt! - Don't you dare slap me with that pillow! (slapping) This is the boyfriend pillow. (Matt laughs) - Look, sometimes you just need a cuddle, right? I think everyone needs a cuddle in life, and if your butt isn't doing the job your boyfriend pillow certainly will. - So if you have a hobby of wanting to create a human being, like I do. I have roughly three fifths of a human here. - So hang on. So we're gonna go - This is the boyfriend buttress pillow complete. I bet you that I'm the only person who has bought this pillow, that does not play League of Legends. (dramatic gasp) (Matt laughs) - Remember when we used to have a tech channel Matt? - How much do you think we spent on the Buttress Pillow? - $69.95 - That've been a great price. Unfortunately we did not. - It was ninety dollars, but it was thirty percent off. So the original price is one hundred and thirty dollars. - For roughly seventy orders of chicken nuggies. You to can have - Inflation has like thirty orders. Chicken nuggies are expensive now. - One fifth of a girlfriend. So we're all cuddled up with our boyfriend pillow and our, our buttress pillow. - Yep - We're ready for bed. - I'm ready. - But how do we go to bed? We all, you know, here's something I have for you and your son to enjoy both at the same time. - Baby shart doo do doo do. do baby shart. Do do, do baby shart, baby shart. - This doesn't have any words on it, but the illustrations are on point. That shark is in fact sharting. \"Deep in the ocean blue, where the lights fade and it grows dark. There lived a wonderful big fish family, with a little baby shark\" Well sharks aren't fish. - Does he shart yet or no? - The shark loved. I'm gonna skip to the part where he sharts. \"His tummy made a gurgle and a grumble too. He felt something moving through him and he did not know what to do. Even in the quiet ocean, a loud ploof could be heard. A \"blank\" came out of his bum, come on, you know the word\". (Austin laughs) - Do you notice that there are a number of other farting adventures, including \"Gus the Gassy Ghost\", \"Frank the Farting Flamingo\" or \"Foxy the Fox's 4th of July Fireworks Farts\". Look at that and try to tell me that's not a little sus. - That is a furry. The eyes are what make it so much more sus. like it wants to be farting right now. - Matt. Yeah, please rescue me. Please rescue this video. Can we move on? - Look, I know sometimes it's hard. So I got you this. - Memo bottle, an A5 twenty-five ounce bottle. - The whole gimmick of this is that it's just a big, clear bottle. - This is it? This is the whole thing? - Not quite the whole thing, because I splurged and got the full starter kit. - No, it's actually goes, just - So the idea is that this is small enough? - To fit into your bag. - Toss your iPad and laptop out of your bag because the memo bottle can come. - Fill up your Jenko jeans with this guy. Wait, does this fit in my.. Wohoo! How much do you think we paid for this? - If you paid more than thirty dollars, I will be offended. - Forty-five. - That's a lot of money for what a weird little bottle that is. Why does it need a stand? What kind of water bottle needs its own stand? - Because it doesn't. - Holding seven hundred and fifty milliliters. The A5 memo bottle is a reusable water bottle for the premium drinker. Get yo cheap *ss alcohol outta here. You can only drink Blue label out of the A5. - It suggests, (glug glug glug) to add a vitamin boost to every sip, by placing a few blueberries or strawberries inside. - You're gonna tell me a f*cking strawberry is gonna fit through that hole? A blueberry sure. But a raspberry? Absolutely not. - I refuse to take part in the rest of this video, I'm just gonna hide behind my completely transparent, clear flask. - Those who refuse to take place. Don't get to be - Oh, magic spooners! - Spooners, so do you love cereal, but hate flavor? As I completely stop us from ever getting a sponsorship to this particular brand? - Matt. - Oh no, no, no, no. - Chug - I'll die! - Are you lactose? - You can't chug milk! - What are you talking about? Of course you can chug milk. - If you chug milk, you'll die. - How are you supposed to die from chugging milk? Matt save some for the cereal! - Well, it's actually really good. - The real reason I splurged for this kit, was for this. (Matt sings) The limited edition, bowl and spoon. I'm pretty sure that's the same bowl that your kid uses, but it's got a bird in it. - It smells like cereal already. - Look at this spoon. - Oh that's a cool spoon. I could spoon with this all day. The idea with magic spoon is that it is very expensive. Like triple, what a normal box of cereal costs? It's very expensive, but it's got no sugar, more protein. - It is the Keto friendly, gluten free, grain free, soy free, wheat free naturally flavored, totally delicious childlike cereal for grownups. Are you a cereal, like aficionado? - No, I actually have not had, I don't do cereal very often. I usually eat a PB&J in the morning. - You're gonna spill, you're gonna spill all over the place. (Matt chews) - Give me your review Matt. - It's not bad, but it's not good. - This is so expensive. Like, I mean, again, cereal should cost what, three bucks for a big box? And this is like, I think you buy individuals like eight dollars for a small box? Like it is..It's a LOT. - It's got a weird after taste, but like, I would eat this. I wouldn't pay for it, but I would eat this. How much did we pay for this starter kit? - For six boxes of cereal and - The bowl - A bowl and a spoon? - Sixty nine dollars. - Nice - Over ten dollars per box. Look, if you wanna go and buy yourself some magic spoon based on Instagram ad, by all means, go for it. That looks nefariously blank. - So we live in California where we know that the weather is just all over the place. Instagram thought, look, I need to know what the weather is. And how would you ever know? - Hot. Hot. - How would you ever know what the weather is? - Go outside, it's hot. - I'm a true gamer, and I don't compromise. So I don't go outside. Instead we have storm glass. - What? - It's its own ecosystem. - I don't get it. I'm just looking at what looks to be a bunch of like little crystals inside a glass. - Well it, so it looks nice. (wooshing) - Oh Kenzie's gotta clean that up. - It's snowing. - So the idea with this thing that doesn't clearly work, is that there is an atmosphere in here. - Oh my God. It's a little, a little crumbly. Walk me through what this storm glass is supposed to do? - So it's an atmosphere in a glass, which means that it rains, thunders, hails. If it was cloudy and whatnot, the pressure in here would simulate like a cloudy rainstorm in here. - And this thing actually works? - No, there's like zero positive reviews on this thing. - How, how, how much was it Matt? - Thirty-five dollars. - It at least looks nice on the desk - It's kind of neat looking, I, I don't get it though. - Do you wanna drink it? Don't drink it. Alright, last but not least. - I'm covered in styrofoam. - Well, first things first. - Hey, I already did a video on this! - What was that video part, a part of? - That was testing YouTube sponsor scams. So Grab a Star, the company who makes these serious gaming earbuds have reached out on numerous occasions, offering to sponsor a video. And as part of this video, I decided to take a look at a lot of these potential sponsors to see if they were in fact scams or legit. And with these, I found that, while I did purchase them with our own money, they weren't amazing. But for the money, which I think was like one-hundred thirty or one-hundred fifty bucks or something. - Well, I find it hilarious that you put it in the scams video because I've been trying to return these for two weeks and. - They won't take 'em back? - Well, they have emailed us several times about sending some, they have been less than responsive about taking them back. I don't wanna end it there, that's boring. Let me introduce you to Rick. - The Mozart Bluetooth speaker. - I called him Rick. - So just Bluetooth speaker? - I don't know. What, what would make you say that? - This looks like a pop gone wrong. - That's exactly what I described it as. I have a feeling that we are the, like we're the sole reason that any of these companies exist. It's just YouTubers buying this stuff to talk about how weird it is. It looks so sad. - Yeah, because you wasted a hundred dollars on him. Oh wait, actually no. I know what you're about to do. (music) The speaker's only on one side. This whole thing is one speaker on the side. That's it. How much was this? - Ninety dollars - That is a ten dollar Bluetooth speaker and a horrifically ugly. - That is a four-hundred dollars in just art alone. - Stuff him inside Rick, and we never have to look at the stupid speaker again. (uplifting music) - Rick hungry. He'll just hold that. And then we'll just - This is almost worse. Matt, do we, can you please sum up this video? What exactly do we find here? - I'd love to say that we got scammed. - You can't get scammed if you're the one who is scamming themselves. Something I have learned far too many times. Okay. Well we're gonna do that huh? - I hate to say it but this, this is a really comfy pillow. - Matt. You're gonna take the butt home? - I'm definitely taking the butt home. - Are you gonna snuggle with the butt tonight? - Why wouldn't I?",

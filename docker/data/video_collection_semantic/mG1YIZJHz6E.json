    "transcript": "(gentle upbeat music) - Oh, is this an exciting unboxing? So Marques, who I'm sure all of you know, and if you do not, I will put a link in the description. He's an incredible tech content creator. I am so hyped because he just came out with his own line of shoes and we have them here. You may have seen a bunch of other creators unbox them, but I'm so excited to check these out. So let's get into it. The first thing is like this bag, I don't even know, like what type? Is this like a, is a shoe carrying bag a thing? Like whatever this is, I'm obsessed, and I'm probably gonna put a bunch of camera gear in it, to be honest with you. So he's calling these 251 because his first YouTube video was 2 minutes and 51 seconds, and that was the beginning of his channel. So the company that he partnered with is called Atoms. I've never personally tried their shoes before, so I'm pretty excited to check these out. Oh gosh, it has like a little strap too. Like this is, okay, we'll get to the shoes in a second, but look at this. So nice. Oh, we've got some documentation. I'll leave a link in the description if you guys wanna check it out and get more info. Let's check out the shoes. Gosh, I love this bag. (gasps) Oh shoot, look at these. They're so light. Wow, wow. Look at these. These feel awesome. I love like light shoes and these feel so light. I can't wait to get my little foot in here. So there's all sorts of little details. We've got the 251 here, NYC tag. The little tag here on the tongue, which has the Atoms Marques signature. I love these laces. They're like elastic. Okay, let's put our foot in here. My foot, it's not your foot, it's mine. These laces are so great. This is soft. Wow, they're so, so soft. Why has no one told me about Atom's shoes before? Look at these. Oh my goodness. Is there like a cool way to like tie them like, that I? I'm so shook. Okay, I'm gonna fall over. Give you a little look. (gentle upbeat music) Like, look at the back of them. So many nice details. Marques, these are sick, freaking sick. This is not an embellishment. I am absolutely shook at how comfortable these shoes are, especially like higher top shoes. I usually can't ever wear these because this part's always like super uncomfortable. I love them. I absolutely love them. Oh my gosh, I don't even wanna wear them outside. I don't wanna get them dirty. These are so sick. I'm just so glad they fit because a lot of times with shoes, it's really hard to determine. Marques did say in his video that these do run a little bit big. I'm actually normally a 7 1/2 in pretty much all of my shoes. And these seem too fit pretty much perfectly. In Nikes, I do wear a size eight. Most of my HOKA shoes are 7 1/2. So these fit me. I do have a little room in the tootsie. They feel actually like a perfect freaking fit. So I probably didn't need to untie that really nice tie that they did because I feel like I can just slip these on and off because those laces are like elastic. How do the cool people tie their shoes, like the shoe people? Again, I will put a link in the description. And a huge thank you Marques for sending me these. I absolutely love them and they're so, I just can't get over how light they are. Like, they're so cool. He did say that he spent the last two years working on these, getting prototype, after prototype, and being able to perfect them. And I think that you did just that because these are freaking sick and I love them. Even inside here, like there's just little details everywhere. There's probably some other secrets in here that we don't even know about and they'll probably be revealed in a later Marques video. Thank you guys for watching. I'll put a link in the description if you wanna check these out. And with that, I will see you in the next video. I'm gonna go take these out for a little walk. (gentle upbeat music)",

    "transcript": "[Percussive Drumming] Today I've got something I've never looked at before I've never looked at anything in this category before. Now, on the surface it looks like I'm going to unbox some kind of briefcase. That's kind of what it is at least in terms of form factor. But inside, is quite a bit of tech. This is a product from a company called \"Renogy\" it's the Phoenix Generator This is a suitcase full of power. And the reason it's a generator is because when it flips open, it's actually two fully functional solar panels that can bring power in and then store it on the internal battery You can see up here, \"Built-in Monocrystalline Solar Panels (20 Watts)\". \"Expandable up to 120 Watts\" Now, you see a guy over here, he's got a backpack, he's out in the wilderness he's enjoying himself, but he still needs power. Alright, I don't know, maybe he's got to juice up his various devices, maybe he's got a drone he likes to fly around cause he's in the mountains and he's gettin' shots, who knows what the scenario is But this thing here, is a ton of juice on the road. Myself, I would probably be more inclined to keep it in the truck, keep it as a backup battery that I could charge from the sun. Maybe your one of these zombie apocalypse type dudes or a survival-prepper type guy. Either way, giant battery in a form factor that I haven't seen before which is this essentially fold out briefcase style. You got a few more specs. It has a \"Multi-mode LED Light\" built in. A \"DC Charge port\", an \"AC charge port\", So if you do want to charge up the battery without the sun, off of a wall outlet, you can I think a lot of people will do that. Got USB ports, four of them. 12 Volt DC output ports. That's a full sized AC out so that means that you're charging equipment that plugs into the wall. This is really amazing to look at these specs over here It can charge an iPad eight times, a drone three times, a laptop five times, and a GoPro 47 times So let's crack this baby open and see what it looks like. Accessory box I assume. [Throws packaging material at Jack] [To Jack] - You weren't expecting that. He's like oh it's a low key safe video and then BOOM! You gotta stay on guard! Alright so here's the unit. *Knock* HOO! That thing seems tough. Taking a closer peak at this you know you're not dealing with a regular briefcase. That's where all your connectivity lives As I said before, full sized AC port, cigarette lighter, couple of USBs actually four And that door, has a gasket on it So I'm assuming you're going to have some water resistance there. And on the other side, let's pop this baby down. Here's the AC in, the cigarette lighter in -- so this is to charge the unit up if you're not using the solar panels. Over here is that big light that's included. And this is the cool part. Boom. Looks like an everyday regular briefcase until this. And then once you got that goin' energy from the sun! What a beautiful concept. Renewable, off the grid, I don't know what you're power consumption needs are, but hey, as a back up source, this is pretty cool. Maybe you're going to a music festival, you get this baby out there, and you become the talk of the town. You're the focal point, people come over, they charge up. That could be you. Every cord known to man that you could possibly want. A charge cable for either -- That's a lightning connector right there. There's also a micro USB for android devices and otherwise. A cigarette lighter cable. Like I said, I think that people who keep this in their truck, or their car, that's going to be an easy way to get juice into this unit. Oh wow, and check this one out. This one looks like it's for a light bulb. It is! With a light switch. The zombies don't stand a chance. You're gonna be living in luxury. So, as you can see I have 43% battery life built in. I activate the AC out. [Beep] Or the DC [beep] out. Look at that. That's a bright -- That's actually a pretty bright flashlight there. Ooo Spoooky Ahh! Check that out that's an SOS mode So when the zombies are closing in, this is your mode right here. Alright, now we should definitely try and charge something up. The cool think with this Phoenix Generator is the fact that it can act as the hub for various devices. There are so many inputs and outputs here that you could charge a wide variety of stuff Now, obviously here I've got some phones, and iPad, and even a camera. This is an A7S And what you'll see is when I go ahead and turn on these ports, (Just hit a button here) for both, and you'll see them come on. So now absolutely everything here is charging. Now, these two phones and the camera are plugged into three of the four available USB ports With the iPad we're actually using the AC output I could also crack this open while those were charging, just like this. And then boom, now I'm getting sunlight charging this up, charging these up I'm golden. It's a pretty cool little package Giant battery and the ability to charge itself from the sun. Forever. As long as the sun is still up there. I think there are some certain apocalypse theorys that wip the sun out as well. In which case... Well, you'll be dead anyway. So, I can't help you there.",

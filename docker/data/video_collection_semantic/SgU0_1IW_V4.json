    "transcript": "there's always that little something that you probably shouldn't do but still are going to do it anyway like biting it this quarter of a lemon Oh real life respawn that's how it works now I can relive biting it this quarter of a lemon alright I'm gonna stop this now let's get into the real respawn well wasn't expecting doing a taste test right over here I do apologize for my brother savage job on opening this one so Razer made a mental performance drink mix this all apparently started with an April Fool's joke and people were like oh my god you need to do this and they did in typical Razer fashion it's all gaming centric designed for gamers by gamers respawn is a secret weapon obviously this product is kind of poking fun of themselves and also trying to maybe grab something that margins from monster redbull and all other end in jinx for eSports arenas especially because that is quite heavily marketed for the gaming industry in general in terms of flavors we got the tropical pineapple classic green apple nice pomegranate watermelon I mean guys I'm a huge fan of watermelon one second I literally have watermelon in my fridge right now because it is delicious but mixing it with pomegranate you're ruining it such a mess and the last flavor we got is the blue raspberry so what these are are glorified caffeine capsules 95 milligrams of caffeine per serving that you mix with water and drink it and you're not supposed to receive the massive energy boost and then you crash it's supposed to be a little bit more gradual there is artificial and non artificial flavors so it's not a hundred percent healthy for you so a typical Red Bull can with have about seventy seven milligrams of caffeine versus ninety five and not capsule however this one would have about 170 milligrams of caffeine I'm gonna try the blue raspberry ooh look little powder yep yep that you can smell all right ooh I don't know guys I'm skeptical it smelled better when in powder form I'm allowed to drink three of these powder cans per day or recommend the dosage we'll see about that huh okay it smells so much flavor from that like little pouch blue raspberry I don't know he's got this nice light lemony texture in the beginning that evolves into the sweetness and now I can taste of raspberry as the background flavor I would say it's pretty delicious guys I can't drink that much caffeine and it's like it's 5:00 p.m. I got my workout to go to let's try this pomegranate watermelon I will say I'm already feeling in the whole performance alert this thing mmm that smells delicious pomegranate watermelon wow it is very interesting the layering of watermelon and then the sourness of the pomegranate calf swirling around filling your mouth with flavor this is very refreshing it's almost like you expect carbonation to come out of these flavors because they taste very much energy drink like but it's quite flat you can drink it but the flavor is quite strong so it's not like you'll be able to chug this thing whole thing down right away it's more of like a sipping thing instead of like done and got a refill this is the proper way of smelling something by the way Wow the green apple smells exactly like if you were to slice a green apple in half and have those aromas in the air it's very refreshing very light hmm so there's a sweetness factor that's pretty heavy but the sourness factor bounces out I really like that first initial half but the aftertaste not my thing all right the last flavor that would be the tropical pineapple whoa this one is yellow for real hmm not a fan of the smell right now hmm he's got this weird weird mouth texture yeah this is my least favorite so far because it's more sweet and the real pineapple has the sourness that really has a nice kick followed by the smoothness of the sweetness here that sour kick is very very non-existent it's more sweet than anything but it's almost like there's this weird balance between it's trying to be sweet but not too sweet I don't know so I just came back from the gym and having fueled up on all this and I just drink right before I left I had about 500 milliliters or so during my taste test and that kept me going throughout the entire hour having not eaten for six hours since lunch normally my energy would drop halfway through the point through the workout but I'm fueled up on all the caffeine so I'm good the one drawback however is that I felt really dehydrated about halfway point which is strange having dranked 500 milliliters of liquid that would not happen with your standard water even now I'm like getting dry my favorite flavor would be pomegranate watermelon what a surprise I have a sweet spot for cotton candy which is what it smells like before you mix it and then it tastes like watermelon juice and I also have a sweet spot for watermelon so what started as an April Fool's joke is now in the gym product I'm not surprised but it's kind of crazy to think about of course this is razor very gaming centric it was only a matter of time they made an energy drink at least it's not full full of chemicals but it's got the raise of pricing all over it obviously this whole energy drink arena is growing especially and the eSports scene but just be mindful don't consume this stuff every day or don't consume it at all it's still not natural and if you're tired take a nap if you need extra energy have an apple that will give you more energy than this stuff would and just be mindful of the consequences of having a box that is so easily accessible and made into a drink that will give you that extra energy you know coffee is addictive and caffeine is - all right guys I'm Dimitri thanks so much for watching this has been my taste test or respawn check out this other relevant content I'll talk to you the next video I'm done with this no more have to lock them up lock up the boxes",

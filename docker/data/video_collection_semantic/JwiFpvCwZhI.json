    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine. And we're back with another iPhone SE video. Today, I wanted to do a photo challenge. I wanted to test out the camera on this but I didn't wanna do it in a traditional way because, well, I can't. I can't go outside. I can't really go anywhere other than in my house and my backyard. So I asked you guys on Twitter to give me some things to photograph. So it's kind of like a little quarantine photo challenge. To make this even more fun, I wanted to test out some of the Moment lenses. If you guys have never seen these before, basically a bunch of different lenses that you can attach to your iPhone to get all of the different camera effects, like wide-angle, there's an anamorphic, there's telephoto. And they just attach to a case. So this is the Moment case. This one is actually made for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 8. They do have a new iPhone SE one coming out but basically it's probably gonna be the same exact thing. The rear camera is 12 megapixels and the front-facing is seven. Of course, this does have only one wide-angle lens which is where these Moment lenses will come into play. So let's pop on this case and go take some photos. Hey Jenn, time for a photo challenge. So I got a bunch of tweets on Twitter. The first one was a suggestion of toilet paper. So I thought maybe we can put the toilet paper on Matty's head. We'll put it on his head and my head. He's like, \"Uh.\" - I'm up. Wait. - Matty, I just wanna let you know, I don't support this. - Wait, wait. - Here we go, Matty. One, two, three. - Tell me when. - Toilet paper, go! (camera shutter clicking) (upbeat music) Yay! Total paper head. Okay, now I'll put it on my head. - [Jenna] One, two, three. (camera shutter clicking) Okay, we got it! Did you get it? We got it, bud. You're such a good boy. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, that mouth stinks. - I think I miss the home button. - I actually kinda miss it too. It's so nice because now that we're wearing face masks all the time outside. Take a picture of my amiibo collection. This isn't my entire collection but I don't wanna get them all out. So I'm gonna take a picture with the regular first. (camera shutter clicking) And then I'm gonna pop this ultra wide on to get an ultra wide amiibo shot. Whoa, this looks cool. (camera shutter clicking) Let's do a video just because. (beeping) Gosh, I feel like we should be shooting a music video right now. (upbeat music) Wario, this is not your best angle. (camera shutter clicking) All right, what do we have next? A chocolate chip cookie close-up or any food for that matter. I don't know if I have any cookies. I do have a cookie. I have a hidden cookie somewhere. I've had this cookie sitting in my desk upstairs in my office since my birthday. I can't believe I haven't eaten it. (wrapper rustling) Do you think it's still good? We're gonna do macro for this one. So this has this little plastic on it, so that you're able to get super close up. Oh yeah. Oh my goodness. I can see a raisin. (camera shutter clicking) This is so close. I wanna show you what this looks like without the macro lens. So I'm using the normal camera now and this is as close as I can get without things getting blurry. (camera shutter clicking) So we're going from this to this with the macro lens. Unfortunately, I think the cookie has expired though. Oh, here's one. Nintendo Switch while playing Animal Crossing. Oh, oh, geez. Okay. I wonder where we can find that. Oh, Jenna, hello. Are you playing Animal Crossing? - Yes. - [Justine] Well I'm gonna take a portrait photo of you here playing Animal Crossing. - Should I smile? - [Justine] I think I like a casual photo of you. Oh yes, candid. Oh yeah, you look good. Look like you just sold those turnips for how? - 606 bells. - You look good, you look happy. Here, give me that. Look, I gotta just. - Let me, let me get comfy. - Just. - On the hammock for you. - [Justine] I'm trying to make the Nintendo Switch your body. Okay, now put your arms out. - Like where? - Right there. Right there, don't move. (camera shutter clicking) This is creative. (laughing) - Oh. Goodness. - Ooh, an artistic selfie with Matty. Matty? Where did you go? There you are. We have to get an artistic selfie for the people. I wonder if they want me in it or they want just Matty. (upbeat music) (camera shutter clicking) These don't look very artistic but we can go in and edit. Oh, look at that. What do you think of this one, Matty? Dramatic cool? Do you like that one? It makes you look good. So it says you can't do pet portraits. But I'm gonna try it anyway. No person detected. Okay, well he is a person and I don't understand why. Next photo challenge is all of your Apple Watch bands. Okay. Artistic. Oh, I might switch up my watch band actually. - I was, I need one! Why are you down here? I like this blue one. - Okay, you can wear it. Yeah, that's, yeah. Hi, Matty. Look, what's this, what's that? (upbeat music) This just looks like a mess. (camera shutter clicking) Artistic. (camera shutter clicking) Now let's put the lenses on. (camera shutter clicking) Okay, we're gonna do a macro. - [Jenna] Whoa, that's really good. - I know. (camera shutter clicking) Okay, we've got some macro. - Can I take one of your eye? - Just for the record, nobody requested this. (playful music) (camera shutter clicking) Oh my god! - It looks cool. - Wow! Wow, I really need to work on my mascara application. (laughing) David wants anything camo. Huh. Huh. I can do better. (upbeat music) Matty! Hey! Jenna! Could you take some pictures, please? This is quarantine fashion at its absolute-- - Oh, it zips all the way up. Yeah. - Finest. - [Jenna] Oh, you don't even need a mask. You're just-- - I know. - [Jenna] Okay, ready? One, oh, it doesn't matter. (laughing) Do a pose. Like a stealth pose. (camera shutter clicking) One. Two. Stop moving. (camera shutter clicking) - It's hot in there. - It's okay. Okay, ready? Portrait. (camera shutter clicking) Okay, ready? - I need to do an angle. Models really contort their body, so they look like models. Do I look like a model? - [Jenna] No. (camera shutter clicking) - Let's a do nice wide-angle. I'm gonna get one down, get real low. I wanna be like, do I look cool? - Well. Sure. Ready? (camera shutter clicking) - [Justine] That looks so good. Oh, take a couple more. - Okay. - I got a new profile pic. (camera shutter clicking) (upbeat music) All right, Jenn. So we're gonna do a TikTok. We can't use the audio in this video because I'll get a copyright strike, but on TikTok, that's the joy. We can use copywritten music. - Yeah! - It's okay. Is it still doing the filter? - Yeah. - Where am I? In space. - Good. - Okay, 'cause I wanna, walk forward and unzip. - [Jenna] Okay. Yeah, you're good. - We could do something and then you can cut. If I walk this way, just straight. - Yeah. (upbeat music) I can't believe it Never felt this way - We had a request for Cream of Wheat, banana, and Campbell's Soup. So first up, I think we're gonna take the Cream of Wheat. I think this would be a really cool shot to do some macro of the Cream of Wheat. But also, we need a selfie with the Cream of Wheat. I haven't done any portrait selfies yet. This is perfect. (camera shutter clicking) I can't believe how much I love Cream of Wheat. Quarantine classic. I don't wanna dump this out and waste it. It's my prized possession. Just a little. (camera shutter clicking) I've actually never really stopped to see what it looks like. What the heck is this anyway? It's wheat. (playful music) (camera shutter clicking) Since we're doing this macro, let's add a banana for scale. (camera shutter clicking) I'm so close to it. It's crazy. Oh, Campbell's Soup Chicken and Stars. I got this in case I ever get sick. This is my favorite sick meal. (camera shutter clicking) (playful music) Jenna suggested since you can't do portrait mode because it tries to detect a person, 'cause it's using AI to try to find a person, that the Starbucks cup might work because it will see if it's a person. Hmm, Starbucks actually sent me this. There's a little picture of Matty on it. It's not picking up the person, nope. Hey look here. - Who, me? - It says move closer. It detected that you were a person. (camera shutter clicking) - I haven't ridden one of these in five years. Five years. I'm trying to get my footing back. - I don't understand why it doesn't think this is a person. Person. (camera shutter clicking) Not a person, you know why? 'Cause it's smart. I hope you guys enjoyed this video. I had so much fun making this. Of course, your suggestions were incredible. Also, thank you, Jenna. She's not there anymore. But she took some great photos. What I really loved about this is the fact that, yes, this camera is great but if you do want to add other lenses, you can still get some really incredible effects. Don't forget to subscribe because I have some more iPhone SE videos coming up for you. If there's anything else you would like to see me test out with this, leave them in the comments below. Also any questions. Anything that you might wanna know, you know what to do. Ask the questions and I might answer. I'm sweating in this onesie. - [Jenna] But are you in the onesie sweating? - I'm in, I'm sweating in the onesie and I'm in the onesie sweating. - Did you steal my brush? (rustling) I have been thefted. - I did not. I thought this was mine. - It was in my purse. Yours is over there. - Oh. I was thefted. Matty, your mom's a thief. (playful music) I'm a thief in the night 'cause I'm stealing brushes",

    "description": "The Logitech G PRO X gaming keyboard is one of the first mainstream keyboards with fully swappable mechanical switches and it comes in a TKL size.  The new Logitech GX switches feature a standard plate mount and come in blue, red and brown variants but that doesn't mean this keyboard allows for full customization.

    "transcript": "so this my friends is the new Logitech G Pro X keyboard I've been patiently waiting for them to release a new TKL line up inside the pro series and this is it it is really awesome they're bringing out swappable switches into the mainstream but that's not going to be for everyone so let's see how competitive the Pro X is right after this the new cooler master master mouse 710 a weird name but damn this thing is good with an ultra lightweight body at only 53 grams for excellent flick control and aim correction the ultra weave cable is awesome for Wireless like feel the ambidextrous shape for me personally is super comfortable and then like the shorter body plus the glide is smooth thanks to white PTFE feet enjoy the domination with an excellent optical sensor and despite the funky name the cooler master mm710 is legit check it out the low so first I want to say the original G pro keyboard with Roma G switches is being replaced with a new G pro keyboard with GX blue switches 429 dollars I personally love the Romer G switch but the proprietary nature of the stem meant no easy key cap swapping while all the new pro keyboards use kale switches with MX stems so at least that's a positive the Pro X keyboard however is a twenty dollar premium where the switches are not soldered to the board so you can choose between three switch options and honestly not much has changed in terms of foam factor from the original except now you can swap out switches and create custom mechanical layouts for your needs and it's got the same really solid frame with plenty of weight that feels heavy on my desk compared to Razer's latest addition the huntsmen te I have two feelings about them keeping the same shell design so on one hand I really like the simplicity of the whole board with a tasteful G logo and a select the larger forehead with that illumination toggle and a game toggle key that disables your windows function and copy keys plus whatever other key you want can be set in the software but I was hoping for a slight redesign so the keyboard feels a bit new and fresh you know the new iPhones came out and everyone has the square cut out for the camera bump that's how you know that's the new iPhone here it feels the same even the side pro text just reads pro instead of Pro X they kept the same fork style microUSB cable so no type-c on any of their gaming peripherals yet we still have two levels of angle adjustment with great stability and unfortunately the bottom row is not standardized just like on the original so keycap swapping and custom adventures for this decal board are limited and I mentioned this because the razor Huntsman te keyboard has a bottom row standardized and that is a huge thumbs up for the enthusiast community who are swapping key caps but they're not really catering to the enthusiast community with this keyboard it seems like and so the main differences revolve around the switches and the key caps with the pro and the Pro X keyboard so first gone are the romaji switches by by now we have three Cal variants or GX variants linear tactile and clicky and because the led on the switch is located at the top instead of centered like on the romaji the font on the key caps has been moved up to accommodate that shine through with secondary characters not being illuminated at all I also find the font to be a little bit inconsistent like how bold the main letters and numbers are while everything around it like your shift-tab home posit cetera are much smaller and thinner in comparison the illumination quality however is fantastic with great vibrancy and color accurate tones to what you set in the software and easy / key customization the key caps by the way are nothing fancy be ready for visible finger oils after the first hour of use and now let's talk about these swappable switches they come in a set of 92 switches so you get 4 extra switches just in case as the TKL layout only needs 88 so in case you like break one of the pins you still have extra there's also a key cap / switch puller in the box as well I think the intent here if you buy additional switches set it's not to replace the entire keyboard for something else but use different switch sets to mix and match two different mechanical layouts on the same keyboard for example I love tactile browns for gaming and typing so I swapped out that entire section in the middle with GX brown switches while keeping the rest the keyboard with GX blues except for my shift ctrl + spacebar that I set with GX Reds for that linear feel and so that's really cool but the downside is the price point at $49 per switch is set it means that whatever you buy you'll always end up having unused switches alternatively you can buy your own set of MX style switches with plate mount instead of PCB mount from companies like Nova keys and you're spending about $20 for a hundred switches instead of buying them from Logitech for $50 and you have options to buy in fewer quantities to match your layout style because I feel like 92 keys even though you can replace the entire keyboard this is not something that I would recommend you doing because why not get the right switches for you from the beginning now Logitech has of course mentioned that they are using specific tolerances for the frame itself so if you're using aftermarket switches with the same MX style mount they might become too loose or they might not be stable or something like that in my experience with halo clears which are also from kale by the way they fit no problem although they were not as tight inside the frame as GX switches but they're not like popping out whenever I pull off the key cap so yeah and of course they were working just fine with the Pro X and so this whole spot Bowl nature of mechanical switches is very much appreciated in this gaming sector but launch the guys is that the massive price disadvantage for the consumer you'll be spending way too much money buying them from launch tech and buying the GX switches versus if you were to buy something in lower quantities like other kale variants and just apply them to the keyboard they will fit they'll work no problem and you'll also be saving money as for the process of swapping the switches themselves it is very simple to remove all the desired key caps use the switch puller to unmount the switch carefully and insert back the desired switch in place again very carefully so you don't bend one of those pins as for my preference between all 3gx witches I don't like dgx blues because I have to lift my finger entirely off the key cap for it to rebalance back so I can't be really fast with my strokes chi-x Browns and GX reds both smooth nice actuation I do prefer the Browns over the linear style because I've just been used to them by the way if you need macros f1 through f12 keys can be assigned in the software just don't forget about the discrete media controls that are activated via the function key and so the original G Pro keyboard was my favorite it sat at my desk for three years and there was nothing that could replace it but the roamer G switch is no more and I welcome the GX introduction of switches into large 2x line up because key cap swap is now a thing and they can recreate romaji feel with the GX Browns anyway even though the specifications are slightly different I welcome the whole mechanical switch customization with the Prague's keyboard that is awesome but it will have been the perfect keyboard if they've done two things one is to reduce the quantity of mechanical switches that you can buy from large tech instead of getting a whole set of 90 to reduce the price and reduced quantity so you can only get like 20 and replace certain section of the keyboard I think that might have been better and number two the non-standardized bottom row is just a huge bummer because Razer Huntsman t they released it with the standard bottom row and they got so many thumbs up from the enthusiast community and the Logitech kind of missed their chance here because the whole customization factor with the switches would have been the perfect complement to customizing the key caps too but unfortunately that's not the case here all right guys I'm Dimitri thanks so much for watching make sure to check out this other relevant content subscribe for more

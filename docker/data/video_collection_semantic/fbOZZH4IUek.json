    "transcript": "- Hey, guys, how's it going? Today I am with \"What's Inside.\" Do you guys wanna introduce yourselves? - Yeah, so I'm Dan from What's Inside. And I love that you have so many knives around here. This is like, right up our alley. - They're probably my favorite thing. - I am Lincoln, and I like how your two knives are neon green and pink. - Those are like my two favorite colors, so I thought that was fitting. - So we take things apart for our channel and see what's inside of them. And we just did a really weird video on our channel. - Yeah. - It was weird. - What was the expiration date on said thing? - 1991. - And I don't really know what this is inside of this box. - Yeah, me too. - So I'm excited to see what's inside of it. - So I think it's an Apple IIc, but I'm not sure. I ordered this on eBay a long time ago, and then I got upset because I realized after I purchased it and won the auction, there is no monitor. So we're gonna open it up, see what's inside, because I actually am not sure. - Do you know what an Apple IIc is? - I have absolutely no clue. - I don't either. - Well this is old. Let me see when this was. This is probably... - Which one is older? The thing that we did on our channel, or the thing on your channel? - Well, depends when that thing was, because this, it says the release date was April 24th, 1984. - Oh wow. - So... - Okay. - Wow. - Retro. - I guess we'll just \"What's Inside\" it. - [Dan] Let's get it. - I have to be careful because I think it might have the original box, as well so I don't want to cut through. - So what's the favorite thing that you guys have opened up? - I really liked Stretch Armstrong. - [Justine] Oh I did see that! That's one... Yes! - [Lincoln] It was really cool 'cause afterwards, in the comments, people said \"If you could've licked the substance inside, it would taste like sugar,\" because it was kinda made of sugar. - That is so cool. Oh! Look at that shot! - [Justine] Oh my goodness! - [Lincoln] That looks so cool. - [Justine] No way! - I love the retro Apple. Retro Apple looks so good... - It's so cool. - Can they bring back this logo? - Check out this box. This is, I mean this is something that you've never even had to experience in your lifetime. - This is kind of like the IBM thing that we did. - [Dan] We did the world's first PC or personal computer, which was an IBM 5150. And I think it was in 1981 when they came out with it. And it was kind of the computer that was mass produced in a way, so much so that they coined the term \"PC.\" - Yeah. - So, Apple, back in the day, they came out with good products, but it just wasn't like the masses, I guess. - No, it wasn't, and they were very expensive, which is still something that does carry over today. So yeah, this is the Apple IIc. And the problem is there's no monitor with this. But this is the original packaging. - There's no screen. - There's no screen, yeah, which is unfortunate. - I love that you just had this though, like this was not planned. We were just hanging out, and she's like \"You know what? I think... What's a tech product that I have around here? Oh, let me go grab my Apple IIc from 1984. It's just sitting in my closet.\" - Well I was upset because it didn't have a monitor, so I thought that I'd never be able to really do this video. So let's, I guess, wow this is... What is this tape? - It's like, some sort of sporty tape. - It is. - To wrap your ankle with. - Yeah. - Yeah, it's tearing the... I'll let you go from that side 'cause it's tearing the box. - There we go. Well it's nice that they put that over top of that. Oh, hey guys, what's inside? You make those jokes all the time. - Here we go. Yeah. - I'm sure. This looks like it is all the original packaging though, which is cool. - [Dan] It really does. - [Justine] Where's the monitor at? Oh look at the cables in there. Oh, there's a joystick too! - And a joystick. - Whoa! - What? - Is there something else in there? - Oh man. Could you play Fortnite with this joystick? - [Lincoln] No. - [Dan] Could you program it properly? - Maybe. - You just build. This is your building right there, then you run. Shoot with this button. - Somebody probably could, I'm sure. - [Dan] You can see the logo on the battery pack. - [Justine] Yeah. - [Dan] Feel how heavy that is. - [Justine] Oh, that's very heavy. - The plastic definitely matches with your knife. - [Justine] It does! - You know the way that we operate. Whenever we see something old, we just always wanna take it apart and see what's inside of it. This is probably something you don't wanna take apart. It's so old and historical and you can use it as a briefcase. - That's crazy. - Okay, I'm going to work, taking my computer. - I mean, that's like a laptop. Like one of the industrial, like PC, or like the gaming laptops that they have. Like this size. - What in the world? It says... Look, look at this. There's bumps on D and K instead of J and F. That's weird. - Is it usually J and F? - Yeah, 'cause that's where you're supposed to put your fingers when you type. - I didn't know that. - You didn't know that? - I knew there was bumps, I just didn't realize which keys they're on. - Yeah, that's where you're supposed to put your fingers on. But they're usually on J and F. - Hmm. - Things kids know these days. - I like typing a lot. - That's good. - That is interesting. - Yeah, I wonder why that changed. - I like the mechanical keyboard. This is kind of, there's actually a whole subreddit dedicated to mechanical keyboards, that people will go on, they just love the sound of it, and they love the feel of it. Here we go. - [Justine] Let's do some typing here for you guys. - [Dan] ASMR. - [Justine] This is the Apple IIc. (clicking) - It does sound good though! I like it. (clicking) - It's so cool! This is awesome. Should we plug it in and just see what happens? I mean, we don't have a monitor. - Might as well. - Yeah. - And I'd say we take it apart, but... - These two buttons are so cool, the Apple logo. - Who knows if it works? - [Dan] Monitor, has a... There's your printer, I guess. - I mean, now I'd have to get a monitor. What's this? Oh, maybe it's an extension cable, I bet. - The Apple logo is on the little plug. - This is really cool. - So I plugged it in, I think we just have to turn it on, see if it does... - [Justine] It's so nice. - [Dan] Okay. - [Justine] Ready? (beep) - No way! - What is that noise? Oh look, the \"Disc use in power\" is red and green. - Wow! - Okay, do that again. That sound was really cool. - [Justine] Okay. (beep) (shuffling sound) - What! Whoa! - That's so cool! - This thing is pretty rad. - So that's kinda crazy, because it is turning on. Now, oh my... - Even if there's no monitor, it still works. - Yeah, we just can't see what's on the screen. - So you can just type and it's doing something if there was a screen. That's pretty cool. - Yeah, I mean it's turning on, so that's a good thing. - You don't have an old Apple computer laying around somewhere that we can just steal the monitor from? - So I do, but that one is also not unboxed yet, so... But this is amazing! I mean, this is where the floppy discs go. - Aw I love floppy discs, they're so cool. - Yeah, you know, you wouldn't say that if that's what you had to use back in the day. - You never... Yeah, I still have floppy discs that have my storage stuff on it from when I was a kid. - So I got this on eBay for... Let's see, how much did I pay for this? I was like \"This is a great deal.\" It's 132 dollars, thinking that I was gonna have a monitor. - [Dan] 132 dollars for this? - Yeah! - Oh, I thought you were gonna say something like, I don't know, 1000 dollars. - No, that's why I was so excited about it. This was discontinued in August 1988. The introductory price was 1295, which is equivalent to 3000 dollars in 2017. Technically, it was more portable, easy to use. It is actually pretty portable. - Yeah, it has a handle on it. - It has a handle, built-in cards and ports. - I wanna see the monitor, see if that has a handle. - Right? - Just walking down the street. - Here it is. I mean, here's like, the monitor. - [Dan] Aw that box is so cool. I just wanna cut that logo off, right there. - [Justine] Right? I would like to cut this up and get it framed. - Yeah, that would be a good idea. - That would be cool. Look at this, this is weird. It says the \"control\" is right here, but \"caps lock\" is way down here. - Yeah, so I just got to that. So, the keyboard layout mirrored that of the Apple IIe, so however the \"reset\" key had been moved above the \"escape\" key, so the \"reset\" key... So \"escape\" is here. - So, the \"reset,\" it's usually over here by the power. - Yeah. - But the power would be switched over there. - Add-on accessories... Oh my gosh, look at this! I've never even seen this! I'm going shopping! This is an Apple flat panel display. - So you can attach it somehow on this to... - Okay, that is cool. - I have never... - What! - ...Seen this before. I've never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever. - I've been in an Apple museum before and I've never seen this. - Me either. - [Dan] Oh okay. - So this is an accessory. So that's the monitor, but this is like the little accessory. - It would be cool to see how you could connect that. - Yeah, I mean, I think it's probably just connected through like the, the monitor port. 128 kilobytes of RAM, that's... - 128 kilobytes. - Yes, but you could upgrade it to 1.125 megabytes. This is so cool. I am excited to test this out, and potentially get a monitor, but that little LCD display is super cool - I could see you getting that... - I didn't even know. - So I was in Prague and I went to... - The Apple Museum! - Yes! The Apple Museum! They have one there, and it's amazing. It's like, just randomly, you're walking down the streets, and all of a sudden, bam. - I was like, wait, an Apple museum. We need to go, I bought the tickets online, we went there, and it was the most exciting thing ever, but I did not see that LCD display. - We've had opportunities to destroy some old Apple tech, and I've just kind of said, let's just let that be. - I think if it's something that's not working, it's fine, but like, this turned on, so I was like, we can't. - And it made a cool noise. - It did make a cool noise. - And you can make an accessory on it. - Yes, this is so cool! I'm so excited that this actually turned on. I have a bunch of other old tech that I'm gonna be doing videos of, it's just... I'm like, it's not timely, so I can just have it sit up there, 'cause clearly this has been around for 34 years already. - Yeah. - So, there's no hurry for unboxing. - Yeah, and let us know once you open the iJustine Apple Museum, 'cause we wanna come to the grand opening party. - Yes, you can come see what's inside, all the jokes, the jokes. Well this was great, thank you guys. I'm so glad that we could experience this together. I am so excited though, because we also did a video on their channel where we ate something that was almost as old as this computer. Well, I didn't eat it... - He did. - I did, I did taste it. - I didn't want to at all. - I didn't either... - It's been about two hours and I'm still feeling okay, so. - It's good, it's good so far. So far. - Well guys, thank you so much. Go check out their channel. I'll put all of the links in the description. Go subscribe and make sure you hit the bell, because the bell is so important. - Can't forget about the bell. - Yeah, you can't forget about the bell. - Yeah, never. - Subscribe, bell, see you guys later. - Goodbye. - Bye!",

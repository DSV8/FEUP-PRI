    "transcript": "(upbeat music) - You and I have been chatting since we first started talking about doing code. There's a lot to talk about. - [Craig] There is. - We should start with the news though, because I think a lot of people expected you to show up and rail against the taking of content by AI, but you actually announced a new AI tool this week. - We did, we did, we launched it on Monday after coming out of Alpha. We launched that in partnership with Nvidia. So we partnered up with them and their capabilities to launch what we think is a pretty unique tool, a tool that first off respects the IP that it was trained upon. So it's permissioned, it's trained only off of Getty Images' creative content. We are providing rewards back to the creators of that content. So as we grow revenues from this service, those creators are rewarded for their contributions to the tool. It's entirely commercially safe, so it cannot produce third-party intellectual property. It cannot produce deep fakes, so it doesn't know what the Pope is. It doesn't know what Valencia is and can't produce a emerging of the two. And we think for version one, the quality's quite remarkable, because obviously, we're a big believer that quality in gives you a better outcome. - I have a lot to talk about with you. Craig, very boldly, allowed me access to this tool. I told him what prompts I was gonna use, but I didn't show him the results. So here's the first one I put up. And this is the tool. It's fun to use. And the well-dressed, influential attendees who joined the Code Conference, fancy hotel ballroom. I will say, I said \"in the Ritz Carlton,\" and it wouldn't let me do it, because I think it thinks Ritz Carlton is a very fussy name for some weird reason, (Craig laughs) wide angle screen shot, so here's the result. Here's all of you. You look great, very excited. I asked it to do it again, and I think next year, we're gonna have you all sit on the floor in the round. (audience reacts) Pretty good. So then I thought I should do something on the news cycle. Famous pop star and Super Bowl-winning tight end holding hands in a convertible. I think y'all know where this is going. It's obviously Zack Efron having the time of his life. (audience laughs) Now, to be fair, I did not specify gender, sexuality, ethnicity, anything. This is a reasonable result for this query in my opinion. And again, Zack and Marcedes Lewis look great. And then, here I asked it to do it again. This is great, this is more or less what Travis and... (Craig laughing) I dunno why she's wearing pads, but it's good. (audience laughs) And then lastly, there's the image that I personally really wanted, which the CEO of a major car company running away from our conference. Here's Mary, security guard looking good. (Craig and audience laughing) These are remarkable results, right? There's this sort of AI problems. You pay too much attention in the hands or whatever, but the hardest problems have been solved. And I can see how, if I was actually writing the story, I was being a little bit meaner to the GM, and I might use a photo like this. Is that, you think that that's what people want in the markets that you're in. - Definitively. So, we started, first of all, generative AI did not just burst onto the scene. It's been something that has been around for years. Nvidia, our partner, actually launched the first GANs model from text-to-image, and so we knew it was coming. And our question to our customers was, \"How are you gonna use it, what do you need?\" And we create services for our customers that really allow them to create at a higher level that save them time, save them money, and eliminate their IP risk. And that last piece is critical within AI. Everything that we heard from our customers was, \"We want to use this technology.\" And that could vary from media customers, to agency customers, to corporate customers. They want to to unlock some of their creativity through these tools, but they need to make sure that they aren't in violation of third-party intellectual property, and that can vary around the globe. If you have an image and it produces an image of a third-party brand or somebody of name and likeness, like Kelsey or Swift, that's a problem. But there's much more nuanced problems in intellectual property, like showing an image of the Empire State Building. You could actually get sued for that. Tattoos are copyrighted. So, fireworks can actually be copyrighted. That smiley firework that shows up, Grucci brothers actually own that copyright. So there's a lot of things that we baked in here to make sure that our customers could use this and be absolutely safe. And then we actually put our indemnification around that so that if there are any issues, which we're confident there won't be, we'll stand behind that. - There's a a flip side to that. So, you know all the training data is yours. We had asked a bunch of providence questions of Kevin earlier, you know, the providence, right? And the next thing that enables you to do is say, \"Okay, we're gonna go pay our creators.\" How does that work? What's the actual formula for saying, \"We generated this image, someone paid us for it, \"and now upstream of that, \"we're gonna pay you however many cents.\" - Right, I think Kevin talked a little bit, I was getting miced up in the back, but I think he talked a little bit about attribution and whether the technologies exist in order to do that. In our case, at a pixel level, I think the question was earlier around audio. The answer is right now though, is those models don't exist. We tested out a bunch and didn't find them to be sufficient in order to do that attribution. So the way we're doing it is we're doing it off of two things. What proportion of the training set does your content represent? And then how has that content performed in our licensing world over time? It's a proxy for quality and quantity, so it's a blend of the two. - Yeah, so you're just doing a fixed model. - Yeah, and we'll evaluate that over time. If we find fairer ways of doing this, we'll certainly embrace it. We looked for technology that might do that, but at this point in time, I think it falls short of the goal. - Yeah, the dynamic here is really interesting. So your customers want this. I need to generate a stock photo or something for an ad campaign. Instead of hiring a photographer, I might go to the Getty tool. Will the Getty tool be cheaper? Will it undercut the hiring of the real photographer? - I think that's yet to play out. I think it's an entirely different model. It's a cost-per-call type model, generative model. And you played with the tool, and I think this is a very good tool in terms of how it walks you through the prompts and what you can get out of it, quality from the start, gives you high res from the start, so, but it's work. And I think comparing and contrasting that to licensing pre-shot is something that we've done some time, studies with customers and things along those lines, and I think it varies. Ultimately, again, we try to save our customers time, because that is the most expensive thing that they're applying. And I think, in some cases, this can be very creative but not necessarily the most time efficient. And I think our pre-shot in many cases can be much more authentic and much more efficient, because you're searching, you're not paying for that search. You're getting a wide variety of content back with real people, real locations, and in many cases, brands care about that, but that can be a much more efficient process. So I think it really, we're gonna find out over time. - Getty's a unique company in this space. You actually employ a bunch of photographers. You send them to dangerous places. You create a bunch of news photos. Are you hearing from your own creatives that this is a problem? - I wouldn't say that we're hearing from our own creatives that AI is a problem. I think we represent over half a million photographers worldwide. So within that, you can imagine within this audience, there's a lot of different perspectives and points of view and take that and multiply it times a thousand, and you're gonna get even more. So what we hear is a lot of concern about intellectual property. We hear concerns that ultimately, things are being trained on their intellectual property, and there's value being created for that, either through subscription services or through other models. And ultimately, people want that to be solved for. But what we hear from our customers is, again, they want to create, and they wanna use these tools. And so our point of view from the get go has always been, and we believe AI can have a constructive benefit for the society as a whole, but it needs to account for certain things. And so we've always looked for transparency in training data. We believe creators and IP owners have the right to decide whether their material is trained on. We believe the creators of these models shouldn't be covered by something like Section 230, that you should have some skin in the game and take on some liability if you're creating these things and putting 'em out there. Again, our tool is one that... We were very conscious as a member of the media. The last thing we wanted to do was produce a tool that actually could produce deep fakes, so your Taylor Swift and Kelsey. Example is when you're gonna have a struggle, because it doesn't know who Taylor Swift is, and it doesn't know who Kelsey is, and it doesn't- - (laughs) It's the only thing in the world that doesn't know who Taylor Swift is. - Yeah, that's exactly right, and that's intentional. And I'd like to think that Taylor Swift will appreciate that. (Nilay laughs) - What are we all working for? It's for Taylor Swift. - Exactly. - Inside of that right there, there's some big ideas there. So in my brief career as a copyright lawyer, in my longer career as a journalist, I find that no one actually cares about copyright law. They don't care about the IP, they care about the money. But the money right now is downstream of some very thorny copyright issues. You heard Kevin say he thinks, Microsoft thinks, that all this is built on a fair use argument that will eventually succeed or be modified in some way. You are, in many ways, on the other side of this. You're suing stability for having trained on a bunch of Getty images. If you win, maybe this whole edifice falls down. Have you thought about the stakes of that lawsuit? - Yeah, I think there are high stakes around that lawsuit. We brought it for a reason. We fundamentally believe that IP owners should have a right to have their content, whether it's used in training sets or not, and they should have the right to be compensated if that's their choice. And I don't buy the argument that Kevin put out there that I read \"Moby Dick\" and therefore, first of all, these computers are not humans. Secondly, they're actually corporate entities that are making money, to your point. And in many cases, they're targeting existing markets with these technologies. I think the Warhol case, not to again, we're maybe a little more- - [Nilay] That's why we're here, I'm ready. - We're a little bit more IP geeks than others, but I think the Warhol case- - Why do you think we played Prince in front of Kevin? - Yeah, I was wondering what did I get to? It was supposed to be The Bengals, I think, interesting. But I think that's gonna play out. I think we're on the right. I think a world that doesn't reward investment in intellectual property is a pretty sad world. Whether that's music, whether that's editorial journalism, whether that's imagery, I believe we want to see more creators, not less. And I think it's actually interesting. Chris was on the stage last night from runway doing some demos, and I think Chris's point of view is one that we share. We want more creators because of this technology, not less, and I think that's a great world So how do we enable, and that's what we put this tool out there. We put this tool out not to disintermediate creators. We put this tool out there to enable creators. So, the users of our tool are creators. And I think it's gonna allow them to create more insightful and innovative ways. But I think others are, in some cases, pointing these technologies directly at the creators themselves or in some cases coders or, and I don't think that is the society that I want to necessarily push towards. - So obviously, you're in litigation with Stability. There are lots of other companies that are potentially training on Getty Images, lots of other companies that are just out there crawling the web and training on that. Are you in productive conversations with the Microsoft, the Googles, the OpenAIs? - We are in productive conversations. Whether they result in something that's productive, I don't know. (Nilay laughs) I think there's a lot of... First of all, I think there's a PR bullshit layer of like, all right, I'm gonna join this group, and I'm gonna try to cleanse my reputation, because I'm a member of that. Of course, I don't implement anything around it. I don't do anything, I just cite the fact that my corporate name is on that website. I think that's not real engagement. I think we can have different points of view on law, but I think one of the things that I hope our model proves is that good quality ingredients in creates a better output. It creates a more socially responsible output, and it creates one that I think businesses will adopt. So yeah, we're in conversations there, but we aren't gonna move off of the fundamental point, which is we believe if you're an IP owner, you should have the right to decide whether your content's used in training, and you should be compensated for that right. And that doesn't mean at the minimus jack, like it's not just a, you know, it's fundamental to these tools. - Yeah, I look at other... We've talked about a lot about music at the conference generally. Again, I'm a nerd for this stuff, but broadly, the music industry has developed its own private copyright law, because the courts are a coin flip in fair use arguments, like crazy coin flips in fair use arguments. And so the music industry is just like, \"We're gonna make our own deals on the side. \"We'll have our own norms.\" My favorite example of this, by the way, is the publishing rights for the \"Thong Song\" by Cisco are owned by Ricky Martin's songwriter, because Cisco just whispers the words \"livin la vida loca.\" If you apply that standard to AI, none of these companies are making money. But the music industry has developed that set of norms. Do you see that happening here where you're gonna need the courts to figure it out for you, or there will be an industry set of norms around licensing and deal making, because the courts are unreliable? - My hope is that we will not need to rely on the courts. Unfortunately, I can't say that's the case across the board. I think there are some very responsible technology organizations that are having dialogue, that are willing to figure out solutions. They understand the stakes at play. And I think you can have those conversations. I think there are others that are just off doing what they want to do and damn the consequences, damn the consequences for IP ownership, damn the consequences for deep fakes and what that means to press and facts and democracy. So, I hope for the solution that we can all agree on it. I don't know that that's necessarily gonna be the case, which is why we not only invested a ton of time and resources to launch a product that we think actually proves that you can do this responsibly. Which one of, by the way, a lot of those actors said, \"Well, you can never do this. \"You could never get access to license data.\" So we didn't even try, because it's an impossible thing, which again, I call on bullshit on, and I think this tool is a big bullshit on that statement. (Nilay laughs) But, we launched, we're spending millions of dollars to go on the other route, because we don't have 100% confidence that we're gonna be able to get there. We hope, and we'll engage with anybody that wants to, but similarly, we needed to have that other track. - Yeah, two more themes I wanna touch on. We can take questions too, if you wanna start lining up. You and I have talked a lot about authenticity. You mentioned deep fakes. Getty does generate some of the most important photographs of our time. Historically, this is the role that Getty plays in our culture. You've said to me that just marking that stuff as authentic is not good enough, that there's another problem here. Describe what you think that other problem is. - Well, I think there's a problem where you can't discern what is authentic. And in a world where generative AI can produce content at scale, and you can disseminate that content on a breadth and reach and on a time scale that is immense, there's that potential that ultimately, authenticity gets crowded out. Now I think our brand helps cuts through, I think our reputation helps cut through it. I do think ultimately that has value, but I do worry about a world where, you know, I think this past year, I heard the stat that there were more AI images produced than were shot on a camera. That's just staggering. Think about where we are in the adoption curve of AI. And so you just play that out on an exponential basis, and then again, you think about a world where there are nefarious individuals and organizations and institutions and that worries me. Our newsroom lit up when the Pentagon image was put out there, is it real? And we're getting calls asking for us to validate that. Now let's put that into an election in 2024. - Yeah, do you think that just marking cryptographically, you're in the content authenticity initiative group, right? - We're in the discussion. We haven't adopted it, to be quite frank. We're not sure that that is the right solution right now. First of all, it puts the onus and the investment on the people creating original content, authentic content, rather than on the platforms and the generative tools that are producing generative content, and we fundamentally think that's a little bit backwards. The generative tools should be investing in order to create the right solutions around that. And the current view, it's largely in the metadata, which is easily stripped. So you guys are a customer of ours. You use our imagery. You strip our metadata immediately when you put it in your CMS, because it's lighter and page loads and everything else, which makes sense, because you're competing for SEO and everything else that you need to do, so you strip it. And so I think what we need to look, and this is where engaging with Kevin and Microsoft and their team, we're really encouraged by the pledges that they made to the White House in order to identify generative content, because we want to do the exact same thing, but we want to do it in a way that really gets at the core. And if we're smart enough to invent this technology that can do generative AI, we can damn well invent the solution that can identify. - Yeah, are you taking any particular steps ahead of the 2024 election knowing that you're gonna compete for real photographs, real images in a world of generative AI? - We are, I would say, but it's one... And we're talking with the Associated Press. We're talking with (indistinct) press. We're talking with our partners and our competitors about how do we go about doing this? And, I wouldn't say that while we're taking steps, we don't have perfect solutions. And again, that date isn't moving. We're getting closer and closer to it. - (laughs) I think one side, you never know. (Craig laughs) - Well, I don't think the elections are gonna (indistinct). But it's one that, I mean, I think this is one of those things where putting technology out into the world under the, let's just move fast and break things. We're playing with bigger stakes here. - Last big think question and then we'll go to the audience here. When Craig and I first started talking, one of the things you and I discussed was the market for photography changed inevitably, forever, when the internet arrived, and more people could create, and our distribution platforms change, the pricing collapsed. I know a lot of professional photographers who their careers have evaporated with the advent of the internet effectively. Does this feel like that? And you've built a business in response to that, that you've changed the business. Is this that same moment, do you think? Is it same level of change? - I think it's clearly a lot of change. I think what we do has value. And I think whether that's a tool that can enable creativity or that's content that is highly authentic, that can engage in end audience in a meaningful way and move them, if you're a media company, move them to understand an issue, or, if you're a corporation, move them to actually engage with your brand or your products. I don't think that goes away. I think this puts different challenges in that it's actually fun to navigate and figure out. I think the most important thing that will allow photographers, videographers, writers, is that we enable more creators, that's the end goal. And if we do that, then I think the world's a great place, and I think companies like Getty Images will thrive in that, and those that work with us will thrive within that. I think if we try to eliminate creators, I think it's a sad world, and I think it'll be challenging for our business and for those that try to make a living. - Yeah, actually, let's start over here. Sorry, introduce yourself please. - Andrew Susman, so with copyright and patents, both stemming from the same part of the Constitution, \"Congress shall promote the useful arts and sciences,\" dot, dot, dot, yet patents over the years have seen a narrowing, a constriction in the exclusive rights that are being granted. Yet copyright has seen largely only an expansion, whether it be how long they last, whether it's what do they cover. And in this case, it seems like some of the creative expression aspects are being wrapped into what are more procedural or data elements. Like if you were to take a text or an image and convert it into a series of numbers, where is the creative expression in that? So, just curious as to if in connection with Congress revisiting what the scope of copyright includes, should they also be looking at how broad copyright is as a general nature? - My man, after my own heart. - Well, first off, I think the copyright office right now is in an act of open submission for input on AI and the degree to which copyright is or is not applied. And obviously, we have a point of view on that, and we'll put a brief in and give input into that. But I think copyright needs to be something that constantly evolves. The world constantly evolves. And I think that's ultimately something that I think regulatory institutions, government, legislative, I think evolve at a slower pace than technology, so they tend to lag, but I do think they are doing their best to go through and be contemplative about how does this move the needle or not on copyright. And I think they're bringing all the voices in together in order to do that, and I think they'll come out in what is a reasonable space, I think. But my point is, is that copyright needs to evolve. And if we want it just to stay stagnant, it's gonna ultimately not match up to the world that we're living in. So I don't know if that answers your question, but that evolution's critical. - Jay? - Jay Peters with \"The Verge.\" I know the new AI tool is designed not to create images of real people, but what if it does? What if it makes a Joe Biden, what if it makes a Donald Trump, what if it makes the Pope? What does Getty do in that situation? - It can't. It doesn't know who they are. - Is there any way for somebody to engineer a prompt though that gets like a pretty close approximation? - Nope, 'cause it doesn't know who they are. It really doesn't, so if you go on Bing, and you do Travis Kelsey and Taylor Swift, it will give you somebody wearing a Chief's uniform that kind of looks like Kelsey. And you won't be able to type Taylor Swift and Travis Kelsey, but just do Swift and Kelsey, and you'll get an output. That's because it was trained on the internet. It was trained on our content and others that sit out on that internet. Therefore, it knows who they are. This content was trained in the universe where that doesn't exist, so it really does not know. Now in prompt engineering, we put things in there that can inform you that that's not something that this tool will respond to. But even if we missed that prompt, because we didn't think of that in terms of the architecture, it won't produce that output. And unless we open up it to train on other content, it cannot produce those outcomes. And I think that's, again, thinking about how you build these tools, so that they can really be beneficial into businesses and corporations and at the same time, be responsible to society. I think it's a really important element. Now, I think what we can do is we can take third-party intellectual property where they actually have the ownership rights, and then we can do custom fitting or whatever it is, custom training of that along with Nvidia to produce a model that's bespoke to that IP. But that's the case, again, where that IP will be owned or have the necessary permissions in order to bring that to the table. So, we'll be doing that with brands and companies over the coming months and years in order to produce some of those. But the fundamental piece here is most large language models, generative models, because they're trained on open data sets under the notion that that is fair use, they know a lot, and they have to now do prompt engineering in order to restrict it. And that's like whack-a-mole, right? - All right, very, very quickly and then we gotta get outta here. - Miles Fisher, appreciate your candid responses. You talk about big picture enabling more creators, and that's for the greater good, so agree with that. At the advent now of deep fakes, a lot of the academic think pieces have compared the criticism to the advent of the camera in the mid 1800s. Creators are left with nothing, the artistry of painting, all of that, rendered mute. I'd just like to know personally, what do you think makes an exceptional photograph? - It's a good question. To me, it's the one that moves you. All right, so, there's a level of photography that I think, whether it's computer-generated or otherwise, it's the one that makes you stop, think, react, have emotion, engage. That's a great photo. Whether that's in news, whether that's in sport, entertainment or in a creative moment with a brand, I think those are the things that talent truly can express. And that's why I believe in creative talent, because I don't think the expertise that goes into... Let's take what people might call stock for a second. If you knew what went into producing a great piece of imagery that actually got your attention, these are people that are understanding how to bring empathy, trust, integrity into photos in a new way that you haven't thought about before. And they can grab that attention to that on an audience. That's tough to do. It's easy... I sometimes equate our business to fast fashion in the creative sense, because we're constantly having to do something new, because somebody else is gonna knock off what we just did yesterday. So, but that's what makes photography great at its core. It's something that makes you stop, think, emote, engage. - Well that's a great place to end it. That was a great question. Thank you so much, Craig. - My pleasure. - Great to have you. (audience clapping) (upbeat music)",

    "transcript": "- Ever seen anything like it? - Where's the cable? - There's no cables! - What the (beep). - 24 pin, 8 pin, GPU Power Connectors. They're (beep) gone! And yet, it's working! - That's amazing! - It is amazing! And to find out how it came to be, we're going to have to go back in time. In time. (time warp sound) In time. Wow! Project Stealth PC DIY Kit. What are you? You look like so much fun. I can't wait to play with you. Ridge. Ridge Wallet can hold up to 12 cards. Comes with a cash strap or money clip and makes a great gift for Father's Day. From May 20th to June 8th, 2022 you can get 15% off your order at ridge.com/Linus. (upbeat music) Top to bottom, back to front, I'm expecting every aspect of the Project Stealth Kit from Gigabyte to be an interesting one. Starting of course, with the PC DIY Kit right here. Unlike a normal bare bones, it only includes a case and a motherboard pre-installed in the box. No cooler and no power supply. And, also unlike a normal bare bones, it includes one of the components that most gamers really prefer to choose for themselves rather than being locked into one option. A GPU. That means you can have any GPU you want, as long as it's this RTX 3070 that's included in the box. But what's special about it? This right here. The 8 pin and 6 pin PCI Express Power Connectors are actually on the bottom of the card where the PCI E slot is. Now, under normal circumstances, these would be impossible to get at. But, in this particular chassis, which is specifically designed with this GPU in mind, there's actually a cutout here to plug in the power. Which, raises another question. Where the devil are all the other power connectors on here! (metal clank) There they are. Not only are our power connectors on the back of the board, but even our front USB, our fans, our front power switch and reset switch and all that stuff. Everything is actually on the back of this motherboard. It's such a cool, and honestly, obvious idea that it raises the question. Why didn't anybody do this before? You see, Maingear actually patented this concept and pitched it to multiple PC component manufacturers back in 2011. Including Gigabyte. So, when they saw Gigabyte release the -- - [Conscience] Ask how you are you just have to say that you're fine. - [Linus] So, when they saw the project Stealth Kit announced with them conveniently cut out of the equation, they were understandably miffed. Thankfully, it seems as though the two have patched up their differences since the kit is available either stand alone from Gigabyte or as a prebuilt from Maingear. And I'm really stoked on that, because it means hopefully we can see more of this kind of innovation. I mean, who doesn't like tidier builds with better airflow? I think the people want to see the board. While I'm pulling this out, I realized I don't actually have to speculate about what happened between Gigabyte and Maingear. Yo, Wallace. How you doing? I got my hands on a Project Stealth and it seems to me that you guys kind of like patented this concept. Do you have any comments on that at all? - [Wallace] There's a lot of challenges in building a motherboard whenever the connector are on the opposite side like that. - Yeah. - [Wallace] But they figured it out, and I'm just really happy that we were able to bring this to market together. - Basically, everything's good? - [Wallace] It's all good, man. - All right. Well, I'm glad to hear that. - There was some conversations that took place a couple months ago, but we're excited to be working with them on other stuff. - Well there you have it. Gigabyte licensed the patent and everything is good to go. Glad to hear it. They thought I was going to build a computer, but actually I'm going to take apart a computer today. Oh yeah, there we go. Wow! This just makes my brain hurt. I mean, it's good that they went and they moved everything to the back even CMOS clear jumper and the battery here. So, you don't need to access the front of the board after you built the computer, which is kind of crazy, but it must have involved some pretty unique PCB layout changes. One question with respect to development is did they build this board from scratch or did they kind of repurpose an existing design? The closest fluke found in a couple of minutes was the Z690 Aorus Elite AX. There are some differences. This is only a DDR 4 board, and this one's DDR 5, which is our next kind of funny and interesting story here. Gigabyte sent over all the parts for us to do this build, and they included some DDR 4 memories. So we're going to be (clear voice) swapping that out for something else. Now, I kind of want to pull off this shield and just see what's under it. It's like a Twilight Zone thing or something. Or, I guess the more up to date reference would be like a Stranger Things. There you have it. Everything is just through holes but they go the opposite way. Man, I'm not. I mean, I guess they already do rear mounted some stuff. You'll see rear mounted M.2 Slots, for example. So they wouldn't have had to completely retool a manufacturing line in order to run it through one way and then run it through the other way. But, I'd still imagine some. It took some kajiggering to do this. It's possible this is totally normal and I'm only noticing because I'm looking so closely at the construction of this board, but the 2 PCIe Gen 4 Slots down here are using through holes for soldering and the Gen 5 Slot is actually surface mounted. For now, I want to take a closer look at this chassis, because as cool as Project Stealth is, if it locked you into these components, that would be a huge hit against its repair ability and its upgrade ability. So, I want to make sure that we're also compatible with standard components. And, just from a quick glance, it looks like we are, because other than these extra cutouts down here, which realistically could just be used as cable management under other circumstances. There's nothing about this that would prevent you from putting a completely standard motherboard and standard graphics card in it. Kudos Gigabyte, there. In fact, they've even got an upright PCIe GPU Mount. You wanted to use a riser and like do that thing, which you obviously wouldn't for projects Dell, unless. Do they have another hole that corresponds to? They do not. That's a missed opportunity, Gigabyte. Should have a cutout right here, then you could have your PCIe cables go up and you could do like a vertical Mount, as well. Jake's in charge of making sure I reach our production quota this week. - Yeah. He's not telling you stories about paint. Is he? - Not yet. So far, I've managed to disassemble it. Ta ta ta ta ta Ta ta ta ta ta - Jesus Christ. - Boop. - All right, goodbye. - Let me just get this thing back to its original state here. As I was looking at the front panel connectors, I got to thinking, in an industry where you can't even get everybody to agree how much spacing there should be between the positive and negative connectors for the front power LED. It's very unlikely, we're going to get all the major motherboard and case manufacturers to come together on that CPU fans should go here, and the 24 pin connectors should go kind of somewhere in here. So, even though the case might be able to be brought forward to a new system, I think if you want to take advantage of this stealthy feature that you presumably paid extra for. I actually don't know how much the bare bones costs. You could end up vendor locked, which I'm never a huge fan of. I'd rather see standards. And this is, almost certainly, a non-standard motherboard. ATX, in addition to where all the holes go into it and stuff, has a maximum depth. I'm pretty sure that this has got to be exceeding it, having all this stuff hanging out the back. The labels, actually on all these headers are super clear, which really goes to show how much easier building or repairing a computer could be, if you had the major players cooperating. Anyway, Plouffe wanted to talk about this internal HDMI cable. Are they just reusing a chassis that used to have this as a feature and then they just didn't want to pay to retool this plastic bezel, because I don't even think it's long enough to go out the back of the case. On the surface, it appears that this GPU uses a super special layout like the motherboard with these power connectors on the bottom. But what's actually going on here is that it's a short PCB card. See, the card actually ends here. And then, there's a couple of little pigtails. A couple little leads coming from these flat PCIe connectors that we first encountered on a Gigabyte RTX 3090 on that Comino system recently. And, then they come out to standard connectors that are just mounted to the back plate. You see, there's little cables there. Totally standard PCB, other than that it's got that weird flat connector. What is the deal with that? We figured out the HDMI cable issue, but it seems to be part of a deeper problem. It's that Gigabyte mostly just repurposed their C300 chassis, which was not actually designed in the first place for this project. Case in point. We've got a three pin fan connector here that you can either plug into the CPU fan header, which is not optimal, or you can run down the front of your board completely defeating the purpose of project stealth. Oh wow! This cutout is not actually quite big enough. It puts a bunch of strain on the plastic. (Linus yells) And that's not because this fan header is not a CPU fan header. It's just because it's just really tight. Finally time to build. We've gone with a 12700. Woop! DDR 5 Memory, 32 gigs, 5,600 mega transfers per second. ARA sent over their Gen 4 7000. Is that a model or is that a read speed? Oh no! It has a big heat sink on it. I can make it fit, Plouffe. You ready? Watch this. Oh yeah. That brings us perfectly to the most exciting part of our build. Gigabyte had a scandal recently with power supplies blowing up. This one probably won't, but -- (explosion bang) Dang it. Why am I taking these screws up by hand? When I have a trustee Lttstore.com Screwdriver. You're going to end up with really long cables for how short these runs are. I could see people definitely going for something like a cable mod kit and getting shorter cables for a build like this. I mean, it's not that you will actually see the extra cable lengths, but cause this chassis wasn't really designed with Project Stealth in mind, there is not a ton of cable management space on the back of the motherboard tray. Could be a bit of a challenge. I'd like to see Maingear take on a chassis for this. Does this case actually fit a 360 millimeter radiator? Wait, where's the air coming from? It just has no airflow? Dang it, Gigabyte! What's the point of a fan filter with no airflow? What the hell! (Linus blowing) See, you can't even get COVID through it. - I already had it! (laughing) - What the hell! No! No! How are you going to cool the damn GPU? There's a fan here doing nothing! Is this why they said, don't use a 12900K? What an utter (beep) disappointment. - [Plouffe] You can air cool it. - With what (beep) air, Plouffe. Where's the air! What the heck! I'm mounting it in the front and if Gigabyte doesn't like it, then they can design a better case. Imagine designing a whole product around getting all the cables out of the way of the airflow and then not having any (beep) airflow. So avoidable. You know what I'm reminded of? The Antech Dark Fleet 85. And I mean that, as the scathing insult that it is. It was like they never actually bothered to build a computer in the case before productizing it. That's what this is. You have to actually try your product before you release it. What is this thing, 200 Watts? Thanks! Thanks for all the fans to move around my hot air. Just run it with the side panel off. Yeah, cause I can't get enough of looking at my gorgeous, complete lack of cables. I love how Gigabyte's design is just an Asetek cooler and then they just put like a giant tumor on top of it. Wait, is this even going to go in there? I don't think I can reef on this hard enough to get this in here. - Yeah. - Oh, it goes all right, okay. - [Brandon] But, it doesn't sit like. - Well, how the hell is that supposed to work? Oh wow! - Yeah. They stamped the front, so the fans kind of come forward a little bit. And what that means here is that, you can't even get the cables through to the front, because of the tank. Brandon, can you see this? These cables are mushed. - [Linus] No, no, no, no. No, I don't like putting the fans the other way. - I know you don't (laughs). - [Linus] It's bad for maintenance. - [Man] Yeah, you're going to be doing so much maintenance on this piece. So much maintenance. - [Linus] Got another clearance issue here. The 5 Volt addressable RGB header doesn't seem to have enough room around it to get this plug into it. Yeah, oh wow! This is not even close to being able to fit. I didn't expect to take up whittling today. I was having so much fun with this. I was sitting here thinking, wow, this is going to be so easy to build. And instead it's the not best. The GPU is actually kind of the coolest part of all of this. The GPU connector is the one that really looks awful. That's pretty cool! Okay, maybe I'm back to being excited again, Plouffe. It's just so clean. Okay, are all these cables through enough, that I can actually close it? Yes, thank you. It's clean as hell! Wait. This OS was not set up by you? - No, I did a Windows 11 install. It hooks into all the Aorus software and that auto downloads a bunch of like Norton and stuff like that. - [Linus] I don't want layered protection. This is an uninstalled wizard. And if you have a window without an X, you're doing it wrong! Oh my God. This is really bad. And, I don't even have SSDs in here and an SSD here. Okay, come take a side, dude. We got it? - Yeah, screw it down. - [Linus] Like if I went to the gym and I had a bulge like that. - Oh, yeah. - It was fricking Gigabyte last time, too. A fricking solid front panel, fricking gaming case. Have you learned nothing! We're up to 80 degrees already. And you can see we've been running our benchmark for just over one minute. We've touched 92 degrees now, after just four minutes. Package just hit 96 maximum. Remember too, the GPU's just running my OBS screen recording right now. Here it is. Package Ring thermal throttling and core thermal throttling took place. Time, six and a half minutes with a triple water cooling radiator. (power drill buzzing) - [Conscience] Ask you how you are you just have to say that you're fine when you're not really fine. (power drill buzzing) - Okay. - Good. (power drill buzzing) - Ouch! (power drill buzzing) (Linus laughing) - [Linus] Okay. So, Cinebench is still running and we are now down to 86 degrees on the CPU package. It's also still quiet. Man, now I really do wish I'd gone like a three quarters of an inch higher, and we just had like a nice tidy holes here. Just put some marters mesh on there and boom done. And that's all we had to do to fix it. Great concept, poor execution. Unlike my execution of this segue to our sponsor. Pulseway.

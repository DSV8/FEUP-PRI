    "transcript": "- Hey guys, and welcome to This Is Now. I'm Matt, the writer director of This Is. Normally, I'm the guy off-screen yelling at Austin for mispronouncing the most basic of words, but both Ken and Austin decided not to show up for work today, so here I am. - [Children] Yay! - Ninja made waves two weeks ago when he announced that he was leaving Twitch to stream exclusively on Microsoft's streaming platform, Mixer. Ninja has spent the past eight years building an audience of almost 15 million people on Twitch, and while he'll definitely take the most loyal chunk of his audience with him, it feels like he kind of is starting from scratch. In his stream yesterday, Dr DisRespect called out Ninja for leaving. DisRespect claims to know the number that Ninja received, and said it was a straight-up bad move because of one simple fact. Compared to Twitch, no one is actually on Mixer yet. The gap between Ninja and the biggest stream viewership-wise is somewhere around 16,000 viewers. For context, Ninja generally has around 20,000 viewers, and the second most viewed streamer has around 4,100, at the time of writing this. That being said, it goes both ways. He has little to no competition on Mixer. Ninja literally owns a platform right now. Mixer was originally known as Beam, not to be confused with Casey Neisat's Beme. - [Jimmy] R.I.P! - So they launched back in 2016, but was bought up by Microsoft only a couple months later where they changed their name to Mixer. Obviously, the platform is still growing, but it looks like bringing Ninja over is going to be a big, big step for them. In just two weeks, he's been able to regain almost 10% of his followers on Mixer, and he's currently sitting at 1.7 million. He also announced on Twitter that he has at least one million active subscriptions on Mixer, which is about 750,000 more than he ever had on Twitch at his channel's peak. A big part of that is because for the rest of August, it's free to subscribe to Ninja for 2 months instead of paying the normal $6 a month fee. So it will be interesting to see how many people stick around when it actually costs that money to subscribe, but it's still a massive crowd that followed. As far as features go, Twitch definitely has a few more than Mixer, but Microsoft has come up with some cool ones for themselves. You can co-stream with up to four people on Mixer, so if someone is watching you play a game with your friends who are also streaming, they can see all four of your windows in one page. Twitch does have a similar feature called Squad Streaming, but it's only for Twitch partners right now. Another weird but kind of interesting quirk that Mixer has is that it gives you experience points in a currency called Sparks for watching people stream. Leveling up gives you more emotes and ways to interact with streamers while you're watching them and when viewers use Sparks to buy things during streams, the streamer actually gets a kickback from Microsoft as a reward. And while it seems like Twitch is experiencing controversy after controversy, between Doc streaming in a bathroom, and whatever the hell is going on with Alinity today, Mixer's growing community hasn't had to deal with much of, if any, blowback yet. So yeah, now there were two weeks out, it's starting to feel like Ninja made the right move. And wait until you hear this next one, all right? So soon after Ninja switched platforms, instead of having his page show the normal offline layout, Twitch decided to promote the top streamers to the 14.7 million people following him. The real issue here is this someone managed to inflate the views on a page streaming hardcore porn, so that showed up on Ninja page and stayed there for over an hour. Now, Ninja was quick to come up with a pretty tasteful response, in my opinion, in a video on Twitter basically letting people know that he had no say or no part in what was being streamed on his channel. And it makes sense, right? The page is still part of the Ninja's branding, even though he's no longer on Twitch. And even though he has nothing to do with it, it still has potential to hurt that brand, especially with advertisers. Like, no advertiser wants to go and advertise someone associated with hardcore porn. The backlash came pretty quickly with the hashtag TwitchOverParty trending for most of the weekend. Now Twitch's CEO, Emmett Shear, did apologize on Twitter eventually, but at first, he blamed the new system for promoting channels on Ninja's page. But then he went on to apologize directly to Ninja. So while Ninja might have less overall viewers in the short term, the fact that both him and Mixer looked like the good guy in this situation only helps him in the long term. So yeah, no matter what happens now, it's safe to say that Microsoft's massive investment has more than paid off in just about two weeks time. In the long run, for short term, they still spent money, but I think it's a good move. MoviePass is once again under scrutiny for reportedly changing the passwords of power users prior to the release of Avengers to prevent those users from actually getting tickets. When users went to sign-in, they were greeted with password errors, and MoviePass support team were instructed to say that was just a technical glitch. Now, employees have also reported that the company had an undisclosed tripwire system that would essentially shut the app down after a certain monetary threshold, and this way the company wasn't just hemorrhaging money day after day. In the app, users were told that there are no more screenings at this theater today, making it seem like there's a problem with the theater, not MoviePass. Because, of course, everyone believed that the theater wasn't showing tons and tons of different copies of Avengers. MoviePass was founded back in 2011, but they're relatively unknown for the first couple years of operation. Plans were decent. They were around $29 to $34 dollars depending on your location to see any 2D movie once per day. It's not bad, but not the great like $10 a month system that it was. In the early days, users printed out a voucher with a one-time use credit card number which had to be manually entered in at the movie theater, and that kind of pissed off both customers and theaters to do that every time. Nowadays, users are issued a MoviePass debit card, and when they check in at the theater, their debit card is credited with the full price of a movie ticket. And then you just buy the movie ticket like you would with cash. Now, the service didn't actually really catch on until 2017, when MoviePass dropped their unlimited plan to just $10 a month. The announcement sparked an absolute massive amount of buzz, and over 150,000 people signed up that night alone. All that traffic actually crashed their website. Probably the first indication, though, that they weren't prepared for this. So how does such a popular company fail so hard? Well, the answer is pretty simple. MoviePass just completely underestimated how much people actually want to go to the movies. At only $10 a month, MoviePass was losing money on literally every time someone went to the movies. If a true power user took advantage of the unlimited plan and went actually everyday, it would equal out to just over 30 cents per movie. So the more people who sign up, the more money MoviePass was losing. But that was kind of the point. - [Jimmy] Movies haven't been that cheap since you were a kid. - Wow, thanks, ouch. Instead, they were operating on the same business model as gym memberships, where the majority of the people who sign up just don't actually use it, which of course covers the cost of everyone else. The problem with that is people actually want to go to the movies. No one actually wants to go to the gym. As a result, the company was just absolutely hemorrhaging money. Although, not as much as Uber, apparently. Since then, they have tried numerous different tactics to try and turn a profit. They've released countless new subscription plans, and then tried surge pricing. Back in April, it was reported they lost over 90% of their subscriber base, which is impressive considering how hard they make it to actually cancel. But then in July, they shut down once again to update the app, but it remains unclear, even to the employees, whether they will actually ever return, which kind of sucks for those people who are still paying for the app. With pretty much every major theater chain introducing their own services, such as AMC Stubs, or Alamo's Victory Pass, I just don't see a scenario where MoviePass has a place in the market. It's no secret that movie theaters make a large chunk of their money from concessions like popcorn and soda, and not to mention that more and more of these places are starting to add full meals and even alcohol sales, which offset the cost of a subscription service, something that MoviePass doesn't have and they never will have. Speaking of massive losses of money, Verizon has just sold Tumblr to WordPress's parent company, Automattic for just $3 million. Now, while $3 million might sound like a lot to someone broke like myself, it is absolutely dismal compared to the $1.1 billion price tag that they originally paid for it. That, for context, is a 99.7% loss in value. That's crazy! Like, that is so much value loss. It's kind of fitting, though, because Yahoo as a whole has made some pretty bad business decisions that have majorly come back to bite them in the ass. Tumblr used to be a pretty big site for blogging, especially in the LGBTQ community, but it failed to keep up with pretty much every other social media app out there. Last year, Verizon decided to ban any and all adult content from the platform in an attempt to follow Apple's lead for more wholesome content. The problem with that is they policed all of this content with a very poorly-tuned algorithm. Now, there was still plenty of adult content that didn't get censored, while at the same time, it purged a lot of content that, while sexual in nature, was not exactly pornographic. Since then, millions of frustrated users left the platform, driving down the value massively. Now, it's unfair to say that Tumblr was just like a 100% pornography. In fact, actually a very small percent of its content was actually porn. However, users were leaving not because people were taking down porn, but because their actual very safe for work content was being classified as adult or not safe for work and being banned. Thank you so much for watching. Be sure to check out some of other episodes here, and make sure to subscribe. If you don't, Austin's probably gonna make me post more of these episodes. So yeah, hit that notification bell.",

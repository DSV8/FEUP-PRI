    "description": "Swedish DJ and producer Eric Prydz and his team make wild, incredible, expensive limited-run events. His latest is his most ambitious  and potentially, his shortest run ever. In this episode of The Future of Music presented by Aloft Hotels, The Verge explores the behind the scenes of EPIC 6.0: Holosphere. After years of development, the multi-story transparent LED sphere only saw one performance at Belgiums Tomorrowland festival. Its been two years in the making and we got an exclusive look behind-the-scenes at what it takes to build the most technically advanced EPIC (Eric Prydz In Concert) to date.

    "transcript": "(electronic music) - [Eric] We've always almost lost money on EPIC, it's been more of a passion project, so we just started sketching on doing a live show that would be kind of more future. You want to give people an experience as they walk away and like, try and blow people's minds has always been our kind of agenda. I actually like seeing it from the crowd's perspective, like they upload these videos on YouTube and stuff. And sometimes I can't believe... It's insane. I wish I was in the crowd. (electronic music) - [Dani] Eric Prydz is an icon in the electronic music scene. Most known for his hits, like \"Call On Me,\" or through his many aliases, like Pryda or Cirez D. But he also sets the standard for live shows. He and his team are not only committed to creating a showstopping spectacle, but to developing new technology to do things that haven't been done before. Prydz and his team have spent the past two years building EPIC Holosphere: an 8-meter transparent LED sphere for him to perform in. (energetic music) It was his most technologically advanced production to date, but it only saw one show. Despite a successful premiere at Tomorrowland, part of the stage ceiling sank after the festival's first weekend, and the second show was canceled. Only one audience saw the Holosphere performance live. But first, The Verge got an exclusive look behind the scenes at how it all came together. - It started off with EPIC almost, I think, it's almost ten years ago now. And at the time, a lot of DJ acts and electronic music acts were doing... when they were doing shows, it was all kind of like confetti cannons and fireworks and very much the same stuff like, bands like Mtley Cre or Iron Maiden and stuff like that were doing back in the '80s. That kind of big arena, which was fine at the time and it was cool, but we just felt that we wanted to use kind of the technology that now is available, that wasn't available then, and just try and do an extension of the music. - [Dani] EPIC stands for Eric Prydz In Concert. Over the years, EPIC has included hundreds of laser beams, millions of video pixels, and colossal, hologram-like illusions. - We had just done EPIC 4.0 and 5.0, which was putting EPIC-- Eric in a cube, so we needed to move away from that, we all felt. So a sphere, at the time, was incredibly ambitious. - [Eric] I do think that the whole sphere thing is actually, I think it was Liam. His idea was to do a sphere with a see-through LED material, so they would appear like holograms inside of it. - [Dani] To get a sense of how they planned to pull this off, I headed to Light Initiative's workshop to get a peek at construction. - I was approached by Mark Calvert with a... very interesting challenge to create a video sphere. And my first, first thought was that's really hard. (Bryn and Dani laugh) But immediately, it was like, \"Alright, how can we start to solve that?\" And the ideas came thick and fast. So-- - Oh, so this is actually how tall the sphere will be? - That's right, yeah. That's it, yeah. - Wow. Dang, this is massive. - We've researched deeply the... ways to which you could make a sphere and we're confident that this way hasn't been done before. - One of us came up with the idea to look at the spheres that you would find motorcyclists driving in at circuses. I think they're called the sphere of death or something? - Yeah. - And I would just sit on YouTube, just clicking through these videos late at night, just trying to figure out how they built them because a lot of the form carries similarities to what we were trying to make. I was just watching these videos at night just thinking, \"What am I doing with my life?\" (Dani laughs) - [Liam] Is this, is this where this has come to? - [Dani] So, with a plan in place and fabricators on deck, they start hammering away on building the Holosphere. Everything you're seeing here has been custom made, even the LED strips that get snapped into the sphere's notches. But the actual sphere is only one part. It also needs lights, animations, and effects to bring the Holosphere to life. - The form that we're now using is... requires an entirely different pipeline to create the content. This is what the content looks like in its two-dimensional form, and... that, when it's wrapped around a sphere, gives us the form that we're looking at here. The challenges in creating content for a spherical form are that the content needs to live in what I would call an equirectangular world. - [Dani] Equirectangular world? - Equirectangular. And that's essentially what you would see if you were to take a camera and film 360 degrees around you. It gets flattened out into this kind of distorted, dreamy, bizarre-looking image where up is no longer up, and left is no longer left, and everything is just strange. So, trying to get my head around creating content within that world was a real challenge. You kind of have to just change your thinking patterns almost into another different dimension. That sounds really crazy to say that, but it's true. I took this video on my phone of me just looking around rather dramatically, and used that video to take into After Effects and track the motion of my pupil here. And that was able to drive the movement of the sphere within Cinema 4D. And what that gives is a very accurate motion and a very accurate animation, which is essentially true to life. - What a lot of people don't realize is that even though, you know, they buy a ticket and they come to see a show, and it's two hours, but for us it's been two years. (electronic music) (crowd cheering) - [Dani] The team says they're unsure if there will be other Holosphere performances in the future. I asked for an official comment about what happened with Tomorrowland's Freedom stage. Eric's manager Michael Sershall said, \"Due to safety concerns, [Tomorrowland] decided to close the entire arena. We were absolutely devastated, especially as it was a situation beyond our control, but safety is always paramount.\" But EPIC shows are known for being limited-run events. Prydz and his team accomplished their creative goal, and now, it's all about what's next. - [Eric] Our live shows, they will evolve, and then after this, something else will come. New technology will come available that we figure out a way to incorporate that, and we will be able to do something that we haven't been able to do before, you know? And it's just on a continuous kind of, in an organic way, just refines itself and goes into different directions. (electronic music) - This video was brought to you by Aloft, different by design. Thanks for watching, hope you enjoyed it, and let us know, what's the craziest show you've ever been to?",

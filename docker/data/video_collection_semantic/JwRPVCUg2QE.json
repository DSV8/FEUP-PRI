    "description": "The MSI GT76 Titan looks like the perfect gaming notebook for people searching out a desktop replacement laptop.  It features desktop-class hardware like an overclocked i9-9900K and a ton of other things.  Then there's the GE76 Raider, a well priced high spec 15\" gaming notebook that seems to have it all.

    "transcript": "so we stopped by the MSI headquarters here in Taipei to check out their upcoming x570 motherboards some desktop PCs and some notebooks I was particularly interested in the notebook section while Dmitry and Michael were taking care of motherboards cuz you know it's the more interesting stuff and they're drooling over it whereas I was just drooling over some of the notebook hardware so this is the GE65 writer and the GT76 Titan two extreme ends of gaming laptops that you can find at the moment from MSI so let's check them out right after a quick message from our sponsors fan Tex and SteelSeries without them Computex 2019 would not have been possible alright so the design on the GE65 Raider at first glance is pretty good I mean they've certainly cut down on a lot of the aggressiveness that MSI have been known for in the past I mean you still get some red and black elements here and there but what really surprised me with the GE65 is the build quality the chassis is mostly constructed out of aluminum and the display fields rock-solid when opening it up and when you take a look at the interior layout it's very clean and minimal there are no fancy stickers or dragon-themed layout going on which I really appreciate but I do want to mention that there are no front facing speakers which is certainly a bummer but rest aside the design looks really nice taking a look at the specs and this is where things take an interesting turn around the g65 can be configured up to an 8 core 16 threaded core I 998 a th CPU and remember this is inside a 15 inch form factor so cooling is certainly a question mark the memory can be configured up to 64 gigabytes there are 2 m2 nvme slots and a 2 and 1/2 inch hard drive so great flexibility in terms of storage now the Wi-Fi card on the GE65 Raider is from killer in this case it's the Wi-Fi 6 module that's supposed to offer up to 2.4 gig is per second of theoretical throughput although you know most of us or at least as most of us are aware of killer networking cards haven't really been that well in terms of offering you know stable networking and if you're someone who's actually using a notebook with an a killer card what has been your experience like has it improved or is it doesn't still you know have a lot of issues let us know in the comments down below I'm pretty sure most of them will actually swap this out eventually for an Intel card moving on to the display it features a 15.6 inch IPS panel with a refresh rate of 240 Hertz which is just insane the form factor and when you pair it up with something like you know the RTX 2017 on max-q GPU I guess the whole experience would just be pretty awesome the keyboard layout is pretty straightforward SteelSeries has been a longtime partner of msi and they have one of the best keyboards in the industry there's good amount of travel distance plus it features RGB lighting I have to say I'm not a fan of the letter design as it does look a bit dated but what'd you guys think the trackpad does feature Windows position drivers although it's not a glass surface so it didn't feel as nice as something like you know what's found on the blade 15 the IO consists of Gigabit Ethernet HDMI mini DisplayPort USB 3.1 gen2 type-c audio jacks a couple more USB 3.1 gen2 ports and a full sized SD card reader which is really nice now the lack of a Thunderbolt 3 port is really odd especially in a notebook of this caliber and when I asked MSI about this they mentioned that when they connected a survey they realized that most gamers don't see Thunderbolt 3 as a benefit which is really really interesting because I would have liked to see Thunderbolt 3 especially in notebook of this width in this price range because you are paying a premium for it speaking of that pricing for the GE 65 Raider starts at $15.99 for the base model and it can go all the way up to 20 $1.99 for the expect out eight cores 16 credit Cory 9 processor and an RTX 2017 on max-q GPU next up is the GT76 Titan this is the big boy the all-in-all desktop replacement notebook that you'd want to get if you're in the market for one now the design is actually very minimal I actually like what they've done here the chassis is primarily constructed out of aluminum with this sandstone grey finish that looks amazing it actually reminds me of the msi titanium other boards to be honest there are some facing speakers designed by Jane audio which is nice and there's also a cool halo lighting strip at the bottom that's well diffused keyboard is once again designed by steel Suites and it's really identical to the one found on the g65 Raider and I'm really glad that they didn't go for a full sized mechanical keyboard layout on the Titan model because it would have just added a lot more thickness to the notebook I mean first of all this notebook ways you know about ten pounds so if you add mechanical switches to it it just would add more to the weight and like I said it just wouldn't look that great to be honest now in terms of specs expect the absolute best of the best so you can configure this laptop with up to 1/4 nine and ninety nine hundred K processor and while there where some thermal challenges MSI does seem to have that thing sorted out pretty well I mean as you can see I did get a chance to crack open up the bottom and poyo boy what a work of art there are 11 heat pipes to cool the unlocked CPU as well as the GPU which in this case can be up to in RTX 20 18 on max q variant msi does claim that all 8 cores can run up to 5 gigahertz and they'll actually ensure to make sure that every unit that leaves the factory hit those clock speeds in terms of memory you can spec this out to up to 120 gigabytes of RAM and the highest-end skew does have that option there are four slots in total two of them can be easily accessed to the back whereas the other two are on the other side which might be a little bit challenging to get to in terms of storage there are three m dot two PCI gen3 slots which have heat pads built in as well as a two and half inch hard drive the battery in this case is 90 watt hours which in this case wouldn't really do that much because I bet that the system would probably last for an hour or two under idle scenarios moving on to the display MSI will be offering two options with the GT 76 Titan so you can configure it with a 1080p 144 it's IPS panel although it doesn't feature g-sync which is really odd especially on notebook of this caliber but you can also opt for a 4k option that is 60 Hertz and has 100% Adobe RGB coverage and finally wrapping things up with the i/o it is just loaded guys so there's HDMI mini DisplayPort type C Gen 2 couple USB 3.1 gen2 type and oddly enough a micro SD card reader that's right my folks a laptop that weighs 10 pounds has a micro SD card reader instead of a full-sized one I mean they clearly had the room for it it's just that they decided to go with something that is totally unrelated well especially for content creators switching over to the other side you get audio jacks couple more USB type 8 ports Thunderbolt 3 port Gigabit Ethernet and power in speaking of power you'll need two 240 watt adapters to power this beast especially the top-of-the-line model and MSI has this too and want adapter that comes included that can take both units and as you can tell the GT76 item from MSI is certainly not a portable solution MSI is really gearing this for a certain type of demographic people who are looking for the absolute best in terms of performance in a notebook chassis although I really don't know if I can call this a laptop considering the size now pricing for the GT76 starts at $3,500 and goes all the way up to $4,800 USD so pricing it is expensive it is an expensive notebook that is obviously a thing but I want to know your thoughts about the GT76 Titan from inside as well as the g76 Raider or the GE65 Raider what do you guys think about it I mean are you interested in something like you know a 15 inch form factor with an 8 core processor like the Raider or you know the GT76 that has the absolute best in terms of specs let me know in the comments down below I'm Ebert with high reckon axe thank you so much for watching make sure to check out some relevant content over here subscribe to our boot sequence channel for the latest news and I'll see you in the next one",

    "description": "When I sat down to select the best tech of 2018, I didn't have a database of performance metrics for each device, or a spreadsheet of review scores. What I had was a list of every product I covered in 2018, and a clear notion of how each had (or hadn't) made an impact on me, the tech landscape, or the broader landscape beyond. What I came away with was a list of six standout products, from smartphones to wearables, that in some way put a dent in mobile tech in 2018.   The choices are highly subjective, but I've done my best to explain my reasoning in the video above. If you disagree with my picks and would like to start your own list ... good news: I've already gotten that started! Vote in the MRMOBILE VIEWER'S CHOICE AWARDS at the link below, and you'll be entered for a chance to win one of the selected products from the MrMobile Awards! Voting closes November 30 so hit the link now!     Until next time, congratulations to all the winners  and Stay Mobile My Friends!   [SUBSCRIBE TO MRMOBILE]     [ABOUT MRMOBILE'S BEST OF 2018 AWARDS]  MrMobile's Best of 2018 Awards were selected based on three principal criteria: products considered had to have been covered by MrMobile in 2017/2018; they needed to be still offered for sale; and they had to be within the means of Mobile Nations to offer giveaways to sweepstakes winners (hence the lack of cars in this video). No manufacturer, carrier or other entity paid for inclusion in this list. Items were directly selected by MrMobile alone.   [SOCIALIZE]        [DISCLOSURE]  This post may contain affiliate links.

    "transcript": "- [Announcer] The best thing about awards? They speak for themselves. So, let's start the first ever MrMobile Awards right. Let's dump the prologue and jump right in to recognizing the winners. (synth music) There are five award categories this year, folks, and only one of them isn't being announced in this video. Stay tuned to the end to find out how you can get your voice heard and win some free stuff while you're at it. Category four: The Captain2Phones Award. This one is reserved for the phones so distinctive, unparalleled or just weird that it forces you to adopt the lifestyle that gave me that nickname over ten years ago. This year, the phone so weird it forces me to carry two is the Blackberry KEY2. With a boxy build and a keyboard straight out of 2010, it's an anachronism, I know. But as I said in my everyday carry video, it's so addictive to tap on physical keys again that I'm not putting it down 'til the KEY3. Category three: The Stay Mobile Award. As I'm constantly reminding people who go by the strict, European interpretation of mobile, the word means more than just cellphone. So, this award goes to gadgets outside the world of telephony. This year, the winners are three, starting with everyone's favorite Zelda machine, the Nintendo Switch. Not quite a 2018 release, I'll grant you, but no other consol embodies the concept of mobility like the Switch, which lets you take an over-widening assortment of games from the big screen to the small and back again without missing a beat. Some of my favorite memories from childhood are playing Mario Kart with friends on Super Nintendo, and that's a feeling that came right back when I was playing the new Mario Kart with Hiato Heusman in the few off-hours between tech briefings on a recent trip to New York City. And it's not just nostalgia for Nintendo. The Switch really is a great gaming machine and I'd buy it all over again. Winner number two in the Stay Mobile Award is another veteran from my recent everyday carry video, the Sony XM3's. This is kind of big deal because these have finally bumped Bose as my number one choice for noise canceling headphones thanks to a combination of smart controls and modern features like USBC. I don't get into any train, plane, or Uber without these and if you're in the market for Bluetooth headphones yourself, you've gotta check 'em out. And closing out the category on the \"Though she be but little, she is fierce\" side of things, the Motiv smart ring. It takes a lot of talent to cram many of the features of a Fitbit into something that fits on a finger and Motiv recently went beyond fitness tracking and tacked on the ability to use the ring as a two-factor security key, too. I love that it's just the kind of innovation these awards are meant to recognize. So, a special salute to Motiv on that achievement. Category two: The Disruptor. We're back to smartphones with this one and while I may well have been thinking of the fearsome weapon carried by Romulans and Klingons when I named it, the truth of this award is it's given to the smartphone that shakes up the status quo. Now, anyone who's been a phone geek for two seconds already knows the phone I mean, so let's not drag things out. This year's disruptor blast is the OnePlus 6T. Undercutting everyone, from the iPhone to the Galaxy Note to the Pixel and finally winning a spot on shelves in brick and mortar stores in the US, no phone has been more disruptive to the US market in 2018 and no phone is a better candidate to save us from our horrific thousand dollar phone future, at least for now. Now, if you're about to jump on down to the comments to bring up something like the Pocophone, save your strokes, folks. These awards are limited to devices I've covered. And with one exception, also devices that are officially offered in the United States. So, congratulations, OnePlus. And with that, I've just spoiled the final category, so let's jump right on through to the end with the smartphone of 2018. No, it's not offered in the USA and no, it's not the perfect smartphone. None of them are. But this one is the smartphone that most captured my excitement with its beautiful twilight-gradient paint job, stoked my creativity with its versatile triple camera array, and pandered to my love of overkill with wireless charging so crazy, you can run it in reverse. The HUAWEI Mate 20 Pro. It's the phone that introduced me to the in-display fingerprint reader. The phone that lasts even longer than my beloved Blackberry. This thing rocks and it's just the kind of kick in the pants the smartphone world needed in 2018. Friends, I know you've got your own opinions and you might've voted differently. Well, you've still got the chance. The fifth award of the year will go to the viewer's choice. And at the time I was laying down this voiceover, it looked likely to go to a phone not mentioned in this video. If it's before November 30th when you're watching this, hit up the link in the description and cast your vote. Best of all, you'll be entered for your chance to win one of five grand prizes delivered before the end of the year. So, get to to voting and get to commenting, but most importantly, please join me in congratulating the winners of the first annual MrMobile Awards. Until next time, thanks for watching and stay mobile, my friends.",

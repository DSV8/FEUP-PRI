    "transcript": "- Hello and welcome to, \"This Is.\" Austin? - Yes. - Do you have a big old glass of water in front of you right now? - I have a fake plant. - Perfect, because I'm gonna give you the hard pill to swallow. - And this is a little too big, but okay. - You need to stop buying desktop PC components right now. - You're trying to tell the gamers to not rise up? - No, I'm telling the gamers to rise up in a different direction and go and buy yourself a nice gaming laptop. - Okay, so the main gist of this video as you furiously dislike the video, and, hate on us for telling you not to buy that sweet new RTX 3070 is this, right now, if you're trying to purchase gaming grade hardware, if you already have a desktop, if you are already gaming on it, you just wanna grab a new GPU and everything else is the same, sure, sure. But if you want to get on board with gaming, you're gonna start fresh, you wanna buy a new system. The gaming laptop actually makes a lot of sense and right behind that, is buying a pre-built gaming desktop, which in a lot of cases, cost similar to the price of the graphics card. We were able to purchase an RTX-- No, no, sorry an RX 580 system for like $700 recently, which is, about what that card goes for. And of course, this is like a Ryzen system with everything else. There are a couple of other things that we are working on right now, that we got like a 3080 out of a pre-built system. - Like that was still several thousand dollars to get that 3080. - But basically, the price of a pre-built is oftentimes similar to the price of just the graphics card by itself. So in theory, - Yes. - You could buy that graphics card and flip the rest of the component. I digress though, gaming laptops have actually not really been marked up anywhere near as much. - Well, because it's a totally different market. There's a bunch of reasons why there's shortage of GPU. We'll go into the one that's not in gamer control, and that's the shortage of memory on those cards. - Well, it's not just the memory, it's also just the fabbing capability. - Yeah. - Of creating the chips. There's a worldwide chip shortage right now which affects everything from card manufacturers to GPU companies. And, it is difficult, expensive, and hard just to get your hands on these GPU dies in the first place. Everyone is fighting over those same foundries, those same fabs, they're creating chips for literally all of the gadgets. - And that's out of our control, everything like that. - Yeah, it will sort itself out. But, it's one of those things that is gonna be a long-term, like these things come and go in big ways. It's not like, Samsung, and TSMC, flip the switch and start cranking out five times more GPU's. Like, it takes a while to wrap these things up. - The differences between the desktop and the laptop. No one's sitting there mining on a gaming laptop. - Don't give him 'em ideas, Matt. - People aren't fighting to buy 20, 3080's, to go build a mining rig. They don't have the same demand on as the laptop. How many people went and sold their 2080's for dirt cheap, so they could-- 'Cause they're, I'm gonna get a 3080, I'm gonna get a 3070, and then they haven't been able to get a system since. - And then those old GPU's to be fair. - Are still going for-- - Are also going expensive. - Yeah, like, do you know that a Radeon VII is going for $1,100? - Like more than it was brand new a year and a half ago? - Yes. So, like, the aftermarket for this has just exploded because again, the demand is so high for desktop things, where I get it, you wanna have your nice, well-lit RGB clean setup. But, if you can't-- If you have to spend double, triple the price of the rest of your system, - It doesn't make sense. - It does make sense. You know what does make sense? Buying a 3070, or 3080 for less than the cost of your-- The rest of your PC, putting in a dock, you still can use your great monitor. - So, again, I feel like this whole conversation really keeps coming up, because we've been working on so many videos for the main channel on a lot of these different topics. So, one of the things we're working on is this exact question, of how much can you get a laptop for versus a desktop? Still working on the video, so, obviously stay tuned. But, one of the gists of it is there are a lot of very good gaming laptops out there for a thousand to $1,500. - Yeah. - And laptops, over the last, I would say definitely three to five years have gotten a lot closer to desktops. Not too long ago, a gaming laptop, a lot of people looked at it and go, \"Oh, that's inferior, that sort of like, it might be branded as an 880M or whatever.\" But it was clearly much, much, like sort of weaker GPU, and it was a much weaker system. That really isn't the case anymore. - Yeah. - You look at these systems with the latest 5,000 series Ryzen processors, sure, they're gonna be a little slower than the Ryzen you might get on a desktop, but in a gaming sort of context, still very powerful. Look at like, the 3060, the 3070, and even the 3080 laptops. Yes, they are not as powerful as those equivalent cards on the desktop, but they're fairly close. And when you put the price factor in there, where you can buy an entire, like fairly solid 3060 laptop, for 13 to $1,500, and a 3060 by itself can cost you over a thousand dollars by itself. That price to performance does not make sense. - And let's be real, you guys are just playing among us with it anyway, so, (Austin laughs) no it's-- - Well, people are also mining, which is something we should, I know you're giving everyone ideas to mine on their net books, but-- - I was looking through eBay on all the different cards. And, for one, it's a crapshoot 'cause a lot of them have been used to mine. - Yes. - And so like, if you buy a 3080, and you're like, \"Oh, this 3080 is a deal at $2,000 right now.\" Chances are, that thing was mined 24/7 since it came out. And now they're like, \"Okay, we'll flip it.\" Because they realize it's not as profitable or whatever. - And the thing is, you can buy-- Like, so, there's a reason why people are buying a lot of these graphics cards at 2000, 2500, $3,000. And that is because they actually can sort of be profitable. Not that we're condoning buying this hardware, but, you can certainly make money even on these very, very inflated prices, which is a problem, because, typically, and there was the original mining boom, like 2016, 2017. - Yeah. - There was a huge flood as soon as it ended, because, of course, let's not forget, this is not a permanent thing. People who are buying all this stuff are scalpers who are trying to flip it, or miners who are trying to make their profit now. As the GPU market gets better and better, these cards will flood into the market. So, I think one of the things to keep aware of is that last time, there was this flood of cards that were, at the time a year or two old, but it clearly been mined. But the performance is actually still okay. Like, sure, I might not trust that card to last seven years or whatever-- - Long-term investment of it. Like if you buy like a used mining card, don't expect to get seven, eight years out of it. - Yeah, yeah, someone has used a lot of that life. But the difference is, before when this happened, this huge flood of GPU's hit the market, but they actually were pretty good deal because they had to-- Obviously, the prices were very low because there's so many of these GPS hitting the market, and the performance was basically the same. It was slightly lower, but you weren't losing that much. However, with these newer cards, so people were buying, 30 series and even 20-series cards to mine with. The thing is, these laser generation cards have the clock speed so high up, and they're so hypertuned to live in those booth frequencies that, the GPU is getting absolutely everything it can. But the problem is, is that, over time, and as these cards are being used, more and more, they're losing performance at a much higher rate. So, as you know, a few years ago, if you would buy a two-year-old card, it might be 5% slower. But some of these like 3070's, 3080's and stuff that you might purchase in the next couple of years that were mined, they could be losing significant performance. Obviously, we'll have to wait and see, but there are a lot of downsides to buying any of these cards right now above retail, or, even buying the used cards over the next few years. Like we're gonna be dealing with this for a while. - And to the-- A little bit more complex, and none of it-- It's all bad news, by the way, (Austin laughs) it's just like, nothing we're not-- We don't have any silver linings to give you this right now. - Yeah. - Because, if you remember, a couple of months ago, we had done a video on why your GPU's were gonna get more expensive. This is before the mining boom. So now you have retailers looking at these systems saying, \"Wait, why am I selling this at MSRP and getting a small piece of that pie, when the guy who's I'm buying it from is gonna go on eBay, he's gonna put it there for a thousand dollars, $2,000 over MSRP, and then, he's making all the profits.\" - Yeah. - So, that's when you're gonna start having your retailers like, best buy or whatever, who are gonna go on there and say, \"All right, well, I'm gonna sell it a little over MSRP because, for you, the consumer, that's still a good deal compared to what the scalper is charging.\" - And that will discourage scalpers, right? - Yeah. - If I'm a scalper, and I buy something for 2,500 and I can only sell it for a couple hundred dollars more than that, I might still do it, but there's less incentive there. There's actually a really similar analogy in the Pokemon card space, surprise, surprise, Austin's talking about Pokemon cards, in yet another \"This Is\" video. But, right now, what's happening is, it's actually similar to the GPU in that, you can't get your hands on cards of retail really right now. Because, pretty much any pack of Pokemon cards box, wherever you wanna call it, is going to be worth more than the retail price. There's such an imbalance in supply and demand that there's a lot of incentive, if you are a scalper, to go out and buy-- Line up in front of Walmart on Friday morning at 7:00 a.m., go buy as many as they'll let you get turn on and flip 'em on eBay for double the money, what's we're seeing here is that, well, not so much for the Walmart's and the Big Box retailers of the world. But if you wanna go to your local card shop, what you're seeing is, a lot of those local card shops, they buy the cars from distributors. The distributors, just like you were saying before, \"Why are we letting everyone else get all the profits?\" - Yeah. - So what you're seeing is, the Pokemon Company says, \"Hey, this is worth $40.\" The distributor goes, \"Okay, we're selling you this for $60.\" The card shop goes, \"Hey, we're selling this to you at $90.\" Or whatever, so, people are making the money all up and down. Now, the same thing, we'll fix it though. It's supply and demand. Like, a lot of people think the GPU's, and Pokemon cards, and TS-5's, are all going to be scalped forever. But the only reason that scalping works, is when there is a huge imbalance between the supply of the thing, how many things that you can actually get your hands on whether it's a manufacturing issue or people just have a lot of demand, or, it's the straight and regular demand. People want the stuff and they can't make enough to supply. - Again, hard pills to swallow, people who are buying these things at scalped prices are just fueling the scalpers right now. It's hard to say, It's like, \"Okay, no, you're just not gonna get a 3090 right now, you're not gonna get a 3080 right now.\" Like, if you say, \"Well, I have the money and I can go do it.\" You are just kind of contributing, and as soon as the scalper, see, yes, someone will still pay this price. They're just gonna keep doing it. Now, if we all collectively, which will never happen, said, \"We're just gonna stop.\" \"We're just not gonna buy these.\" - It's gonna take us a while. Like, if you are considering buying a new gaming PC right now, you have a couple of options. Number one, if you're able to get something at MSRP, do it, like literally, any graphics card that's not a GT 710, that you can get at MSRP right now, is a good deal. If you wanna sell it, you want to be a scalper, sure, whatever. But also, just to get your hands on it, like, that's not a difficult decision. If you see something, - Yeah. - Instant buy it, beyond that, you can look to purchase a pre-built desktop. Some of these are actually pretty decent pricing even if you only wanna buy it for the graphic cards, - See, I'm-- - And you wanna flip the rest of the system. It's not a crazy idea right now. The third or fourth option, whichever one I'm on right now would be, surprise, surprise, the title of this video, buy gaming laptops, stupid. Sorry, I don't mean to call you stupid, 'cause you're very handsome, very attractive. You're an incredibly intelligent and your eyes, I think really kind of give me some sort of questionable feelings inside, but, I love you dear viewer. And I'm so happy that you love us too so much, that you've subscribed, and ringling the ding-a-ling bell. However, when it comes to buying a gaming system in 2021, I really do think that there's an excellent argument to purchase a gaming laptop. You're getting performance which is so much better than all the gaming laptops. If you don't wanna use this a laptop, guess what? You still can just dock it, like you said. - Here's the thing, looking at like high-end last generation gaming laptops, 2080 laptops, those aren't that bad right now, it's definitely cheaper. But then there's still good ones, like the Zephyrus G14 which, - Amazing laptop. - Starts it with like a 3060 that's what? Like, 1400 bucks? - You need a 3060 Zephyrus G14 for about 1500 bucks. But it's got like one terabyte SSD, Ryzen9, like the whole deal - Yeah, it's a really, really, good laptop, - Yeah. - For the price. And again, it's cheaper than pretty much any GPU that you're gonna be getting aftermarket. And, again, I'm a big proponent of docking my laptop. I like having only a laptop, - I agree. - I don't like having a desktop because, I can't take it with me. - Sure. - As soon as I dock it, I just dock it behind my monitor, guess what? I feel like I have a desktop. So-- - Yeah. And then, if all of these options sound terrible, Matt, if you're like, I don't like any of the things that I've proposed 17 minutes into this \"This Is\" video, then, may I suggest, a little thing called, patience? It's a difficult one to take advantage of my friends but things will get better. I think that what we're seeing right now, is an absolute worst case scenario of a bunch of factors that have made graphics cards pricing completely, and totally insane, in a way that we've never seen before. But it will get better, if you can wait it out, if you can keep using your GTX 760 for another six months or something, then you might just be able to get an upgrade which is not going to cost you a literal organ. - Here's, I think the best example of, we're in the worst case scenario. Razer has their 3080 laptops are coming out, which, Razer's always been a pricier laptop. - Sure. - Which, I mean, I like them because, the build quality is amazing. - Yeah, yeah. - But everyone always says, \"They're expensive, they're expensive.\" They are still cheaper for their maxed out 30, it was like 3,300 for their max, like their top level 3080 laptop. - Yeah. - That is still cheaper than buying a 3080 system right now, so-- - Yeah, you can sell-- I've seen 3080's on eBay for like 2,800 to $3,000, which is (beep) stupid. I'm just saying a lot of stupid right now, 'cause everything in this choice is stupid. - No, it is, like, it is. It is like, if you try and justify the price of a 3080 right now in this-- Like in this climate right now, you don't have a valid argument. - The only thing is, the only people who are buying these things at such ridiculous prices are really miners, though. I don't think very many normal gamers are spending $3,000 on a 3080. - The most normal gamers can't afford it? - Even if you could, you shouldn't 'cause that's-- - Right. - That's like, me buying evolutions booster boxes at $1,500 each, knowing that they're gonna come down at some point when people come to their senses. (Austin clears throat) - I've watched him do it, I've watched him, I've watched him. - I did not-- How dare you lie about me like that. - I've watched him do it. - I did not do that specific thing, I've done other stupid things for Pokeman cards, I'm not gonna do that. Anyway, let us know what you think in the comments below. Should you buy a gaming laptop? Should you go stand in line at your friendly local Micro Center and try to grab something at MSRP? Or, should you exercise a little thing called patience? Let us know, ringling the ding-a-ling bell, subscribe to \"This Is,\" and we will catch you next time when we let you know about the next impending tragedy to the technological space in the year 2021.

    "transcript": "(hip hop music) - Whoa! Ho, ho. Ho. What's up guys? Lou here, back with a fresh video. And this is actually a long time coming. Some of you have seen this before. It's a lot of stuff, space and stars. This video's not about space and stars, it's about my set up. I did two videos a little while ago. I covered these monitors, from LG Ultra Wide Monitors, the TV, the audio, but I didn't really tell you about all the knick-knacks. All the little things that make up this set up. Audio interface, keyboard, mouse, my chair. Back here I got some headphones, some hard drives, a computer, everything else that you might want to know about. So this is episode three, we're gonna conclude everything there is to know about this set up. Before we get into it, big shout out to LG, without them this set up would not be possible. And in fact, this set up was the inspiration for a giant giveaway that recently happened. It was called 'UltraWide Festival'. Somebody won their dream $10,000 set up. If you wanna check out more about that, a link will be in the description. But let's finish, let's culminate, my Ultimate Set Up Tour, episode three, starts now. So, as I said, the core of this set up is the displays. But I've already talked about that. Go back and watch episode one and episode two if you wanna know more about them. This video's about all the other things, all the knick-knacks. Let's talk about my chair a little bit. This is a Herman Miller Embody Chair. I've had this for awhile. I'm gonna put a link to this and everything else down in the description. They're super comfy, they move around a lot. They're kinda flexible and stuff like that. A pretty decent range of motion, tons of adjustability, and overall just a comfy spot to sit in. Keyboard, let's talk about keyboard. I've been back and forth on so many keyboards, you guys have no idea. I keep coming back to this one. It's by a company called Phoenix. And I don't know man, it's just got a smooth vibe to it. Yes, wired, I was hoping to find something wireless, but what's the difference? You don't need to charge it and you have one tiny wire. The mouse, this is the MX Master. I switched from the Performance MX to this. I love the texture of it. The ergonomics, if you will, the way if fits into a hand, into my hand, specifically. You could have it connected to a laptop, as well as a desktop, just by flipping a switch on the bottom. Audio interface. I'm a really big fan of Apogee stuff. I've been using this stuff for a long time. Of course you can do audio recording on here as well, if you wanna send an instrument or a microphone into it. You have a quarter inch headphone jack here. Makes me sound beautiful, which is a hard thing to do. Don't nod your head Jack. Couple of remotes over here. There's actually an Apple TV hooked up to that TV up top. Apple TV to the TV. And then the remote for the 50 inch 4K. Spin around to the corner. These are some new headphones that I've been experimenting with. Wireless from Sennheiser. Made a video about these, HGR185. An open-back style, controls right on there. With this little dock, you can be sure that they're always gonna be charged. Also, a little card reader which is Velcro'd to this, let's see, external, I think this is six terabytes. We have other storage. Standard Thunderbolt, little mini-raid situation. These things are kinda cool. This dock is for our SSDs that come out of our shoguns. This is strictly used for editing purposes. The Mac Pro 12 Core Mac Pro. You know I've been through a couple now. This is actually the second, the first one got fried. Maybe it has something to do with what I ask of it. Spitting pixels out, like I spit rhymes. Right Jack? Now this little cabinet over here, this is really important because it keeps everything tidy. We got a bunch of different cables and stuff in there. That's my favorite power strip in the world, that little Belkin, I will link it down in the description. And it's my favorite, cause each outlet swivels. This battery backup unit here, with a couple of USB chargers on the front. Everything that's super important goes into the back of this. So, if you do have a power failure, you're ok. These are like, wait til you see the names on front. Everything is labeled, after Ninja Turtles. Because they're turtles in a half-shell. Turtle Power. So these guys are super fast, right. Super fast SSDs, and it's one of the few places in history where Shredder and Splinter actually work together. Now this table, a lot of people ask me about this table, it's actually a dining room table for eight. Theoretically, you're supposed to be able to get eight people around this table. From a dimensional standpoint, just know that this is about nine feet long, I believe. I almost missed the webcam. You can see this is much wider than your average webcam. See, I'm not that far away from it, and you can see the whole space here. LogiTech for Business, the C930E. Watch, bye bye, NSA. There it is, episode three, my ultimate set up. Who knows for how long this is gonna stay this way. But I'm super happy with it right now. Quick preview, gonna be doing something insane on the other side of the room. Super insane, you're not gonna want to miss it. Subscribe if you wanna check that out. It's gonna make this thing look puny. You have no idea. Alright, thanks again. Leave a thumbs up if you enjoyed this content. Also, shout out to LG and their UltraWide Festival. Go check that out, link will be in the description. That's it, that wraps it up. Catch you guys on the next episode. Later. (hip hop music)",

    "transcript": "the day has come to once again bask in the glory of the work done by the necromancers of engineering over in Shenzhen who have been toiling away on another abomination this time in the form of a 16 gig version of the RX 580. and here it is this is one of them I think it should be in the Box the link on AliExpress was sent to me by a viewer so thank you very much for that and in today's video we're gonna see if we can actually use any of the extra video memory um yeah let's check it out but before that you ever wonder how Ram actually works I always just assume the electricity goes in and then like magic makes computer things happen well if you want the real answer to that question you should probably check out today's video sponsor brilliant.org brilliant is the best way for you to learn intimidating topics like math and computer science interactively from the comfort of the least ergonomic position you can manage on your couch I'm learning I've recently been into brilliant's new how technology Works course you know with all that Ram learning but you can try any of the thousands of lessons brilliant has to offer free for 30 days just visit the link brilliant.org or click the link below and the first 200 of you will get 20 off of brilliant's annual premium subscription oh that is some fancy packaging which actually looks kind of familiar I think this is the same company that made that weird mobile RTX 3060 die on like a normal graphics card PCB the one that needed the virus drivers hopefully this one doesn't need the virus drivers but we'll find out we even get a box with some graphics on it this kind of reminds me of the kind of packaging Graphics you used to get like 10 or 15 years ago on graphics cards it's it's kind of nostalgic I am very excited to see this high frequency graphics card and according to the back apparently this is a 4K gaming graphics card which makes sense considering the 16 gigs of video memory well a oh that's not a great sign why did they use the 2048 SP version of the rx-580 that's like the loser died now the standard version of the legendary RX 580 has 2304 Shader cores and 144 tmus but later down the line AMD took a rusty scalpel to the RX 580 birthing the 2048 SB variant for the Chinese market with you guessed it 2048 Shader units and 128 tmus now the reason I find it weird that they use this cut down variant is because I can't really imagine that a normal RX 580 a mid-range graphics card from 600 years ago reasonably being able to use more than 8 gigs of video memory let alone the circumcised version but I guess we'll find out later in the video now getting back to the physical characteristics of the graphics card it looks exactly how I expected it to look it just looks like an AliExpress graphics card this is a decent looking cooler on here it's nothing particularly fancy but it should be able to handle that cut down RX 580 die without much problem what is interesting is we just have a six pin supplemental power connector compared to the eight pin that you often get on RX 580s and then in terms of rear i o it's pretty standard for cards from this era we even get a DVI port which is something you don't really see these days anymore but with that let's jump to the Future after the testing to take off the cooler and have a closer look at all that video memory oh my God ow there's our cooler it is quite basic but it's not nearly as basic as like a wish GTS 450 you know at least there's like heat pipes going on we've got some actual thermal pad contact and stuff and then here is our very reasonable 16 gig circumcised RX 580 look at all those memory modules they actually seem kind of sanded down I know that these are Samsung modules but you can't make out any of the information on them which is interesting and then back here is the power delivery we've got five sturdy looking phases and then the die looks disappointingly uncircumcised it just looks like every other AMD die so with that let's drop it in a system and test it yes now there's a point of comparison I'm starting out with an 8 gig version of an RX 580 now unfortunately this isn't a circumcised one it's actually a pretty Giga chat version of the card so it's not a fair comparison in that way but by the end of the video we'll see if we can find a use case where the circumcised 16 gig card outperforms this all-natural 5 8. starting off with Battlefield 5 at 1080p High settings and the game is running very well on this Asus card this is quite an easy to run map but still this is great performance for a card it's been around for as long as this has although there is something that's a bit worrying despite having eight gigs of video memory available at 1080p we're just seeing about four gigs of allocation which is not looking promising for the scalpel victim foreign settings and it's a bit input laggy but it is cyberpunk I feel like that's quite normal for the game but even here we're just seeing about four gigs of memory allocation so I guess we're gonna have to start pushing up the resolution a bit I'm sure the GPU will be fine with that I mean I think we just go straight to 4K that's the way to do that okay so we still don't have our entire memory pool allocated but we're getting 14 frames per second with the more powerful GPU very good let's see if we can get the entire memory pool allocated so let's jump the preset up to ultra with no Fidelity FX oh it's still hanging around six gigs but now we're getting like seven frames per second there we go eight gigs high and it's telling us it's gonna use about 10 gigs of video memory which is good that's what we want from it now we just need to hope that it can't run due to the memory bottleneck as opposed to the the GPU oh it's actually performing quite well I'm guessing it's because everything other than high textures is on low and despite our memory allocation being quite a bit higher than the other games it's not anywhere near the 10 gigs we were promised which I guess makes sense considering that we don't have 10 gigs of video memory foreign there we go this is gonna be the game uh so with medium settings at 1080p we're hitting seven and a half gigs of memory allocation so I'm assuming with some tinkering The Last of Us is the game where we'll get the Abomination card to outperform this one but first let's see if that card needs some virus drivers oh it's so much smaller hey there we go it immediately recognizes that it's the loser version of the card very good nice the driver installed just work like any AMD card that's very good so now let's see how it performs it's not running quite as well as the Asus card and I think I can see why not only has the chip been brutalized it's also clocked a lot less aggressively so obviously it's not going to perform as well and with Battlefield 5 at least the loser's massive endowment is irrelevant interestingly all of the scalpel work does mean that the cut down car does use quite a bit less power now when I moved over to cyberpunk the performance difference was even bigger because the core frequency on the 16 gig card was just so conservative so I decided to do a basic overclock on that graphics card just even the playing field a little bit so now that we've forced our halfway decent core frequency which interestingly the only way I could get it to work was through the auto overclock feature in amd's drivers anything I did in Amazon afterburner the graphics card would just ignore for some reason but anyway now the performance is a lot less tragic and with all of that you can see that the memory allocation is exactly the same as with the 8 gig card so not really benefiting from that are we but let's bump the resolution up to 4K to see if we can use some of this girth we're still not seeing more than six gigs of video memory being allocated although it's climbing but it is still kind of getting curb stomped by the 8 gig card so um let's try some other games I I don't think again it's running nearly as well as it was on on the Asus card but look at that we're getting close to being over our eight gigs of memory allocation which once that happens the card will really start stretching its legs oh no we've been downgraded massively with the Asus RX 580 it defaulted us to medium with a rendered resolution of 720. hey the video memory Crusher nine thousand a 1080p medium settings is not really video memory crashing but it's kind of usable we've got about 30 frames per second here and it it feels okay but now we need to start cranking things I'm just gonna go just Ultra there we go we've got an over eight gigs of video memory allocation it's performing quite well we haven't lost that much frame rate because we've got all this cozy memory Headroom we can use hey next I'm just gonna crack the render scale giving us a rendered resolution of 4K yes finally we've gotten well over 10 gigs of video memory allocation and we're cruising at nine frames per second this graphics card really is a 4K Powerhouse actually let's see how the 8 gig card handles these settings hey there we go that's result we were looking for if only this Asus card had 16 gigs of video memory we'd be getting nine frames per second as opposed to whatever the hell is happening here we did it we got a result that's exciting which brings us to the end of another video thank you very much for watching if you enjoyed it subscribe to the channel if not don't I don't know whatever and until the next video bye

    "description": "There are plenty of cool gaming keyboards out there in 2019 but in general they're getting a bit boring.  So we went on the hunt for unique features and items that more keyboards SHOULD have but don't because most gaming companies want to play it safe.  Is this the way to design the perfect gaming keyboard in 2019?  We think so....

    "transcript": "this is a unique key cap that we gathered Computex I also have this one from ducky good times good times well hello good people I'm Dimitri and our trip to Taipei for Computex had really opened up our eyes about keyboards in general we weren't really into this whole boutique / premium / affordable brands like ducky Leopold or Vermeil oh but now it got us thinking that the gaming keyboard scene is becoming a bit stale so brands like Corsair Logitech SteelSeries Razer ASUS have fantastic gaming reputation in the keyboard space but they all have basically the same keyboard with slight design variations although I will appreciate the different variations of mechanical switches that basically is what the deterrent of maybe you picking a steelseries keyboard / Logitech one and so on today's video I would like to discuss my favorite keyboard features that I would love to see expanded into the gaming keyboard market because let's face it the fact is that gaming keyboards now are becoming way too boring the masterfan series from Coolermaster has now received a fresh new look with a square frame designed to generate high pressure airflow and silent operation the fans feature this beautiful addressable RGB illumination and you can pick it up in 120 240 and 360 millimetre variants learn more in the description down below alright so one of the latest keyboards I have landed here in the studio is the ROG Strix scope and it's actually the keyboard that inspired this whole conversation I would love your input and all the points that are to follow so this one in particular has two unique elements one is the oversized control key that is the same width as the North American layout Shift key and they've literally received an innovation of the word for this control key alone now is it actually anything special as a crouch key actually yes so if you play with your keyboard angled like this the pinky finger doesn't have to reach to avoid the Windows key and thus it's really awesome for FPS gamers larger control key more area for your pinky to make mistakes and therefore you will still press it without needing to reach for a tiny control instead this non-traditional layout also pushes the spacebar to the right giving you more comfortable reach to the Alt key but that is something that I had to train because I'm not really used to using my thumb for anything other than the spacebar which by the way on the scope is also slightly shorter the second cool element on the scope is the privacy key that minimizes your desktop and mutes the audio of course you can do this yourself with windows d to go into the desktop however that does not include the mute functionality so it's cool that Asus is thinking about ways to integrate some sort of this Universal shortcut that I will probably use once in a while and you will to and love to hear what you think about different macros that you use on daily basis that would be really cool to have on a gaming keyboard so will share your thoughts in the comments we've also seen plenty of secondary wheel integrations on keyboards that could replace several macro keys I like what Drevo has done with this low profile easy to access wheel on the side it's not just the volume wheel I like what SteelSeries is doing with the new apex line that there's not intrusive and hold multiple functionalities now I appreciate the effort of including additional key caps most of the time they are just wast keys in different color like the silver ones for the scope keyboard or different texture and contours with the Corsair keyboards but what about unique Escape keys or different graphics on the space bars or just spreading out a little design flares here and there that isn't too much but shows you that your brand cares about sort of this whole brand building and recognition there are some really insanely detailed key caps available from companies like dwarf Factory or hot keys project and I'm not advocating $30 per key caps I just hope that brands gaming brands use that for inspiration for example I got this key cap from gamers storm and they don't even make keyboards that I use on my Escape key looks pretty cool and I would love to see a few ROG themed key caps on future gaming keyboards or some cool low-profile ones from Logitech it doesn't have to be super fancy or expensive just has to align with the brand imagine having a really cool Escape key that has little texture or different graphic on it or maybe the same thing with the Enter key or the spacebar it would definitely elevate that gaming brand keyboard above the rest because we haven't seen anything like it in the gaming market we've seen so many of those the enthusiasts keyboard market where you buy key caps and you swap them out but having something that's standardized on the gaming space would be really cool and I'm not even talking about PBT double shot key caps which feel amazing and that really premium and only a few handful of keyboards actually have PBT key caps like the Corsair k70 mark 2 RGB and I know this isn't for everybody but I would love to have this verge of of gaming keyboards merging with this whole like enthusiast community of keyboards are / mechanic keyboards is a really fantastic place to explore all types of ideas but gaming brands I'm hoping are taking note but what's under the key cap is even more important like quality stabilizers and you know there's more to mechanical switches that MX cherry and I love the trend of companies making their own like putting with liquor switches large tech with romaji steel series with a new omni point switch and even HyperX is making their own switch taking chances to set the keyboard apart from the rest is one trend that I appreciate most with gaming brands also it would be great to have full height adjustability and not just the two levels that we see on most 99% keyboards high customization is something that's very important for typists and so that leaves us with the cable I personally love a removable and non braided light cable like on the driver Blademaster te and if you guys recall my Onix had a coiled cable on the way keyboard that looked really awesome and most of the time now all we have are hard non removable braided cables with the only advantage of having cable routing built into the bottom of the keyboard like with the scope and Corsair keyboards - but coarser keyboards have the built-in USB pass-through on many of them which makes the cable really thick and the last thing I will say is the font on majority of gaming keyboards just pisses me off why does it have to be this ugly aggressive bulky stretchy weird font on majority of keyboards that come from all these gaming brands why can't be simple clean letters and numbers that you can appreciate that still looks fine in this aggressively aluminum body and so my perfect vision of future gaming keyboards lies in this like Hybrid territory where you can tell it's a gaming keyboard maybe by certain keyboard switches like the spacebar the the Escape key or the enter but the rested body remains clean and almost minimal but still has a bit of character as to what the brand tries to achieve and tries to deliver with the combination of that law sweet sweet diversity of mechanical switches and I know I'm not the only one frustrated with gaming keyboards every single new one that comes out it's like what is new it's the same thing that we've seen for the last five years but with a slightly different body and maybe some little tiny little features here and there but none that have come out that says hey I'm a perfect hybrid here by me for our canadian audience memory Express is your place for all types of electronics and hardware goodies with fantastic prices great customer service and uber price guaranteed with stores in BC Alberta Manitoba and the new Saskatoon location everything is linked below thank you very much all right guys I'm Dimitri thanks much for watching let me know what you think about this whole discussion have you found your perfect keyboard yet for the hybrid functionality gaming productivity typing whatever whatever let us know in the comments thanks much for watching check out this other relevant content and I'll talk to you in next week",

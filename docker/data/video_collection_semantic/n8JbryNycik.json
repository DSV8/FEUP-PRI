    "transcript": "today I'm having a look at a new power supply feature I found interesting enough to do a whole video on Madness but first what's this A Darby does Tech stuff Minecraft server powered by our friends at lenode which we all know is the best Linux based cloud computing and web hosting service and aside from providing amazing Minecraft servers the node offers a whole host of linuxy services services like node balancers cloud computing database management and even kubernetes just to name a few if this sounds good to you sign up to the node using the link in the description below for a 60-day hundred dollar credit thank you lenod for sponsoring today's video [Music] as you can tell from the box the delivery driver clearly used it as a seat all the way from wherever it was shipped wow wow the power supply in question is the new Swift version of corsair's rmx series of power supplies now as the loser that I am I do not have the correct test equipment to properly review a power supply so this is more going to be like a Hands-On but it's based on the rmx series of power supplies so I'm sure it's a solid power supply but do look out for proper reviews of it what we're going to look at in today's video is the weird layout of this power supply look at that oh [Music] on the surface this just kind of looks like a normal power supply but it's not with a normal power supply we have all of our connectors for modularness on this side whereas with this new Swift series they've moved all of the connectors onto the side of the power supply now I've immediately noticed something of concern these aren't your standard Corsair power supply connectors they're like new little bubble connectors look at how small they are that's reasonably annoying because if you have fancy sleeved cable replacements for a Corsair power supply they're not going to work with this one anymore you're gonna have to buy new ones which I'm not a big fan of see so it says here it's for use with genuine type 5 cables not the standard Type 4 cable compatibility woes aside it seems like a good idea right it means that you mount your power supply on the side of the case and then you have access to all of your connectors without having to remove your power supply but I do foresee some problems with that it's right next to the side panel of the case so is it gonna impact case compatibility a lot uh well I guess we're gonna have to find out today I also want to see what the cable side of this looks like oh you don't get the Nifty cable pouch with it anymore that's a shame actually I guess the combination of the small connector and the pretty flexible cable means it shouldn't take up too much space I mean let's plug it in [Music] now that I see it like this I I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this so I guess the next step is to try it in a bunch of cases and see if it works or not to really push the convenience of this new configuration to the Limit I'm only going to pre-connect the 24-pin before mounting the power supply something which would be Madness with a normal power supply [Music] I will say this stock type 5 cables are a definite improvement over the stock Type 4 cables they're more malleable and the 24-pin doesn't have that huge knuckle in it that's annoying to route and once you have the cable plugged in it's easier for you to use this Pit of Doom to hide the extra length of cable in because there's not a bunch of connector and stuff in the way that space is a lot more clearer now and with the new connector location you're just using space that's wasted with a normal power supply now if you ignore all of the other cables you can see that we've managed to Route it really nicely it also comes with two single eight pin connectors not those weird umbilical dual ones that cause house fires so that's nice [Music] the more I'm using this the more I'm surprised that no one's done this before just adding these connectors as you need them with the power supply mounted may not seem like a big deal but I end up in this position almost every time I build a PC where I forget to plug in one of the modular connectors and 99 of the time you have to unscrew the power supply and move it out so that you can plug the connector in and then move it back in whereas here you you just have access to it now the General Cable Management still isn't beautiful back here but that's more my fault than the power Supply's fault but with a bit of elbow grease I could make it look way better but Cable Management aside I've already real sold on this idea but before I fellate it too enthusiastically this is a modern Corsair case with 1.2 loser units of space next to the power supply so obviously it works in here but I don't think it's going to be a universal solution so I want to try a couple of cases to see where it does and doesn't work but first let's test fit the side panel because of how much flatter I could get the cables the side panel actually fit much better than it did with the normal power supply so let me laboriously remove the power supply and try it in some other cases now for my extreme compatibility test I'm gonna use the Ebola case granted you probably shouldn't use a mid to high end power supply in a terrible seven generational budget case but I added lying around so let's see if it fits oh that's clearly not gonna work um let's try another case next on the list of cases I happen to have lying around is the 100r again a pretty unreasonable use case nope it has the exact same problem and I guess the moral of the story here is that any case that doesn't have a dedicated bottom basement is likely not going to work because it has a solid metal panel on the left hand side of the power supply [Music] let's try this ridiculous Asus Nez gochan case which I think is a really interesting use case because it's a very short case and with a normal power supply when I built in it I actually had to remove this bottom hard drive cage for any even reasonable Cable Management to happen down here and I think this new power supply May fix that problem [Music] okay so I may have just spent like three minutes stuffing things in a hole but I think even just with that little bit of effort it's worked better than it did with a normal power supply we've still got the hard drive cage in here but we managed to stuff a whole bunch of crap into that small Gap next to the power supply and I think maybe the side panel will go on let's have a look it does with surprisingly little effort actually it fit on there all in all as far as standard modern power supply basement cases go I think this is a really good idea that I hope catches on it doesn't work in all cases and with something like an o11 dynamic or an H9 it still works but it doesn't have the same benefit as in a more traditional case so it's by no means is revolutionary as the invention of the vibrating Cod piece but it's a nice quality of life Improvement which is not to be snuffed at it is just a shame that you can't carry over older Corsair power supply cables and I don't think the 10 price premium over the normal rmx power supply series is entirely Justified but it's not a huge difference either way let me know what you think and until the next video thank you for watching bye-bye [Music]",

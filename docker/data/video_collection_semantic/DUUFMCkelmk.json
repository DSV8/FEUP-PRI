    "transcript": "- Hey guys it's Justine and I am so excited because today AirPlay 2 was finally released. This is something that we have all been waiting I would say patiently for but I've been quite impatient. But today it's the day and to celebrate we're going to do a little HomePod scavenger hunt. So basically, I'm gonna be showing you guys how you can control your HomePod with your voice. You can tell Siri now specifically which room you want music to be played in, and you can even set up the HomePods as stereo speakers. So this is super exciting because you will actually have surround sound. Which is something that, (clattering off-screen) Maddy come on I'm trying to film a video. (laughs) Here, - [Jen] She doesn't care about surround sound. - Go outside. Okay so let's just try it out. Another thing that's really cool is Siri will also be able to access your calendar, so she'll actually now be helpful. What's on my calendar for June 4th? - [Siri] You have seven appointments. Here are the first three; on Monday at 8:30 AM check in for Keynote. Do you want to hear the remaining four? - No. - [Jen] Yeah! - (laughing) No! So Siri just told me that I have WWDC Keynote. Oh, baby I can not wait. So this HomePod is in my office. Turn the volume up to 50%. - [Siri] Okay. I changed it. - Play the new Arty song in my office. - [Siri] Now playing \"Couldn't Be Better\" by Arty in the my office. - (laughs) You can also move the music to other rooms. Move this song to the bathroom. - [Siri] Now playing in the bathroom. (\"Couldn't Be Better\" by Arty) There's something in the water now - [Jen] It is through the water! - I know! Move this song to the kitchen. - [Siri] Now playing in the kitchen. - [Justine] We gotta go to the kitchen. C'mon let's go let's go let's go let's go. Let's go, Maddy, we gotta go to the kitchen! (Maddy barking) We gotta go to the kitchen, we gotta go to the kitchen! We gotta go to the kitchen, Maddy! (\"Couldn't Be Better\" by Arty) Move this song to the living room. - [Siri] Now playing in the living room. Baby I couldn't be better - This pig has boots on! I forgot what I wanted to ask you. Play Klangstof everywhere. - [Siri] Now playing Klangstof everywhere. - Now it's playing everywhere! C'mon let's go see! Playing. (smooth rhythmic music) C'mon let's go upstairs, we gotta go. - [Jen] Didn't know we were doing fitness today. - That's why I told you to put your shoes on. - [Jen] We're doing fitness today. - Play Klangstof \"Everest\" in the bathroom. - [Siri] Now playing \"Everest\" by Klangstof in the bathroom. (\"Everest\" by Klangstof) - I love this song. Play this song everywhere. - [Siri] Now playing everywhere. - No, no, no, wait. - [Jen] It's a good tune. - It is but this isn't what I wanted. - Play (laughs) - [Jen] No, no keep this keep it! Keep the song, Siri! Who's she gonna listen to? (\"Cap Ft. Trouble\" by Rae Sremmurd, Swae Lee and Slim Jxmmi) - What is this? What song is this? - [Siri] This is \"Cap Ft. Trouble\" by Rae Sremmurd, Swae Lee and Slim Jxmmi. - Slim Jxmmi? Play Klangstof \"Everest\" everywhere. - [Siri] Now playing \"Everest\" by Klangstof everywhere. - Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. I'm pretty sure you guys get the point, right? (\"Everest\" by Klangstof) Shape me up until I follow - (singing along) All I want is Everest Playing, playing, playing, playing. Stop playing my music everywhere. - [Siri] Pausing everywhere. - Are you looking at our beautiful Hawaii picture? It's beautiful. - [Jen] It is. - Okay now I want to test out the surround sound so we're gonna need to get to HomePods together and put them in the same room. The set up is pretty much super simple. I'll show you, so let's go, c'mon. - [Jen] You kinda look like a HomePod. - [Justine] He does actually look like a HomePod. (laughs) So another thing that I'm thinking, is because they decided to release AirPlay 2 before WWDC, will this mean that there is a potential to actually release a HomePod mini? Maybe, maybe they're getting ready. I'm hyped. Let's go set these up. Let's go get two of them. C'mon, Maddy. C'mon HomePod man. - [Jen] Is that yours? - Uh, yeah. Do you think I stole somebody else's award and put it in my house? Here we go. One pod, now let me go get another one. - [Jen] I'm gonna wait here. - Okay. - [Jen] Are you gonna need me to follow - [Justine] No I think you, - [Jen] Oh you're going to the kitchen I can go to the kitchen. - I'm so hyped. Are you excited? So we've got our two HomePods this is the one that was in the living room and this one is in the kitchen so now I'm gonna change it inside of the Home App to be in the same room. So it should be as simple as clicking Create Stereo Pair. So living room, kitchen. Where is this HomePod located. Living room, oh my gosh here it is. Okay tap one HomePod, tap on a HomePod above to identify it and swap them if needed. So they're assigned to the correct left and right. But is this my left or is it your left? So if I'm looking at them, if you're looking at them. So it's happening, but so, look, you can switch it. (\"Make it Mine\" by Jason Mraz) This sounds so amazing. Play Arty Boy Remix. - [Siri] Playing \"Arty Boy\" by Flight Facilities. - Okay, but wait. This sounds so insane, do you hear that? (\"Arty Boy\" by Flight Facilities) So here we have our new grouping, our stereo pair. I can't believe how good this sounds. This actually sounds way better than I expected and I am not, I might, I mean I am overdramatic sometimes, - [Siri] Featuring Emma Louise, - Wait. Is it playing in the kitchen, too? Or does it just sound like it's in the kitchen? No wait, the kitchen is in here. This is so weird. Hey, Siri, stop playing. The way that it lowers the volume and kind of throws the audio it sounded like this was still in the kitchen. That's so weird. This sounds awesome, okay, is it bad if I want to get another HomePod to put stereo on my TV? I think I have a problem. I guess the first step is admitting you have a problem. Okay, well I guess that's the end of the video. 'Cause I showed you all the things I wanted to show you. Now I guess, wow, I can't believe how good it sounds. Do you have a song request, Jen? - [Jen] Oh, play Shawn Mendes's new album. - [Siri] Here's the newest album by Shawn Mendes. - Oh, Shawn, Shawn Mendes? (singing along) But I just can't (singing along) It isn't in my blood Well that's it, I just wanted to show you guys this really quick. I hope you guys enjoyed it, I am so excited for WWDC it is coming up. You guys have any other thoughts or predictions on what we're gonna see, leave those in the comments below and I will see you guys soon. Oh, don't forget to subscribe, don't forget to click the bell, don't forget to like the video. (sighs) Sorry, gotta say it. Okay, I'm done, let's go. I gotta go put these HomePods back now. - [Jen] Get a thumbnail. - Oh I need a thumbnail! - [Jen] Put it back. - Okay I gotta put it back. Thanks. Okay great can you take a picture instead? Okay, hey, wait did you stop yet? - [Jen] I did it, you're not recording. - You're not recording? [Jen] I'm not recording. - It took us so long to get this intro video, I'm embarrassed. - [Jen] We have it all on film. - I know, let's roll some of it. How's this, is this too close? (laughs) And you can set up (laughs) I just see you blinking like, I hate you. - [Jen] I just had to blink, come on now. - You can play Home (laughs) - [Jen] (laughs) I'm sorry. I'm sorry I don't have any self control. Okay, okay, you can put in music, right? Oh gosh I'm sorry. - Yes, it's okay I'm sweating now. You can play music in (laughs) Should I stand up, maybe? I don't know what gonna help. (both laughing) okay. - I know you can play music in different rooms. - [Jen] Alright I'm gonna have myself under control. - Okay. - [Jen] What? - This filter is still on. (tapping microphone) Do you see audio on this one? - [Jen] Yes. (both laughing) - Hi Maddy, AirPlay 2? AirPlay 2! (ambulance sirens outside) It's like freaking, like, every time I go to film. So now what this means, what? - [Jen] Your phone's just lighting up. - So, what we're gonna do is, what's wrong? - [Jen] Text message on your computer. Look, I'm just looking out for you. - No, I agree. - [Jen] You agree? - I agree. - [Jen] (sighs) It's not symmetric with the fireplace. - I'm not or, - [Jen] Nothing is, it's really just, - It's alright, is it you hate it is it really bad? - [Jen] It's not symmetric. - Okay it's alright. - Okay so now I have, - [Jen] Oops, start over sorry. Hold on. Should I start a new clip? - Yeah. - [Jen] Okay.",

    "transcript": "- These scammy chargers are back, well, really they never left. It's been a couple of years since I've talked about these and there's been some deceitful developments to say the least. Oh, and the scammers value this thing at $76. God, please help us. (upbeat music) Hey everyone, how are you all doing? If you're new here, welcome. My name is Krazy Ken, and this is the QuickCharge Pro, which is built with groundbreaking nanotechnology and it can charge any battery to full in minutes. Clearly, the scammers were not satisfied with the last two products I debunked in this category, so they've come back for more, which means I have more BS to dissect. So let's start with the video ads. I found two delicious YouTube ads for this brand. The first one starts by showing a phone charging from zero to 100% in only four seconds. Then the ad flashes many tech related images in rapid succession, and then it says there's a new groundbreaking discovery that's reversing planned obsolescence. Oh gosh, not the planned obsolescence argument again, scammers, you gotta get a new shtick. And smartphone companies are trying to make this discovery illegal oh no, and rather than spending 1200 to $1,800 on a smartphone every year, this $37 device will turn your smartphone into a lightning fast handheld supercomputer that will last a lifetime. And this is all thanks to the gadget's AI technology, which will override your phone's operating system. Slow loading times will completely disappear. This new charger is equipped with revolutionary QC3.0 technology, which is four times faster than traditional chargers, and it can charge a depleted battery from one to 100% in 11 minutes, and it allows your phone's battery to last up to 56 hours. But how? It's simple, Fred! The charger distributes power-hungry apps into a more energy efficient flow. Okay, just a quick side note, if you need to milk your phone's battery, you can just turn on the low power mode or whatever it's called on your phone, and that'll work just fine. You don't need some magical third party accessory. We continue to see this woman narrating on screen, which kind of surprised me, because many of the ads I've investigated are typically just voiceover narration. And she goes on to say, her and her team developed this product. She used to work at the biggest smartphone company in the world when this planned obsolescence scandal happened, and she hints at Apple. And she claims phone software updates are actually downgrades, which can destroy your phone, so you're enticed to buy a new one. She was tired of this, so she worked with some colleagues to build a solution which removes planned obsolescence from a phone using Smart Defrag Technology. Just plug it in and you're done. But since smartphone companies are lobbying against them, they're not sure if they'll be able to restock the device anytime soon. You know, I just realized they never once directly say the brand name of this product, which is probably not the smartest idea. But anyway, we'll dissect this ad more soon and pick it apart, but first we need to look at the second ad that I found. And if you thought the first ad was bad, (Ken laughs) buckle up. The second ad starts with a shot of an iPhone being plugged into multiple USB power adapters. They call this a controversial device, but they never show it in any other parts of the ad. The narrator claims it can charge to 100% in record time and reverse the age of your phone's battery, restoring it to mint working condition in three weeks. The ad continues to talk about a malicious product cycle that slows down devices, it's called Programmed Extinction. Programmed Extinction? Is that even a thing? The ad claims this extinction forces people to spend thousands of dollars every year, but fear not, MIT is here. They always seem to save the day. They discovered a groundbreaking nanotechnology that extends the battery life in your phone, but also charges your phone much faster than a regular charger. And they proceed to show four phones charging to 100% in about four minutes, all from the same charging device. This fast charging tech is possible, thanks to more than a year of research led by Professor Steve Gibbs. Steve diagnosed a major fault in traditional chargers. They use metal wires to pass through electricity to your phone, and the problem with metal wires is they degrade, and this causes damage to your phone's battery. So the MIT engineers began to manufacture a charger that uses carbon nanotubes. Then we meet this gentleman who I guess is supposed to be Steve, but with different glasses, I guess. He explains the nanoscale wires claiming his team is able to achieve much smaller power consumption compared to metal wires. - Nanotubes are hyper powerful and can charge any device to full battery within minutes. - [Krazy Ken] Then the MIT team released a test batch of 200 QuickCharge Pros. Hey, thanks for finally saying the name of the product. The results were staggering. - My phone charged in just 15 minutes from zero to a hundred. - I love New Tech so much that I actually make a living reviewing products. - [Krazy Ken] After the success, MIT ramped up production, but oh no! Big Tech got wind of it. Multiple big tech companies pooled their resources and attempted to patent the carbon nanotubes so they could stop the QuickCharge Pro manufacturing. And the case is still ongoing. Manufacturing is halted and might not continue. So tap the link below to get your own charger. There are many false claims with these ads, so let's have some fun and break them down. The first problem is if you charged a battery this fast, it would get extremely hot, probably start on fire. So this is fake. In fact, all these fast charging battery scenes are fake. Hey, I can draw battery graphic too. Give it a little animation and play it back on my phone as a video file to make it look like it's charging. Yeah, it's great! Adobe After Effects, and Apple Motion are wonderful tools. Anyway, another big issue is the performance claims. The scammers say QuickCharge Pro can make your phone run faster. This is incredibly unlikely because phone operating systems have protective measures built in that prevent USB and other accessories from just hijacking the operating system. You could still probably achieve this if you jailbreak your iPhone or route your Android device, but generally speaking, these types of protections would make an accessory like this impossible, and the device would still need to be programmed in a specific way to communicate with your phone properly. Later, I will open up one of these QuickCharge pros to see if there's any hardware inside that would be capable of this. But the scammers go further, and again, they use an exhausted argument that many chargers have used in the past. Planned obsolescence. Specifically, these scammers for years have been weaponizing the class action lawsuits against Apple that occurred during the Batterygate controversy. Here's what actually happened. Batterygate started in 2017 or earlier, depending on how you interpret its origins. On January 23rd, 2017, Apple issued an iOS 10.2.1 software update, which optimized iPhone power management to prevent the phone from drawing too much power from a degraded battery, which would result in abrupt shutdowns. But this attempted fix resulted in unwanted performance slumps, and Apple wasn't transparent about what was happening. They fixed these issues with iOS 11.3, which offered new battery management features and transparency, but users were already taking legal action against the big fruit. Years later, as of January, 2024, iPhone owners who were part of the 2020 class action lawsuit finally started receiving payments. The lawsuit applied to select iPhones affected at the time, and this has not been a widespread issue since, so for all intents and purposes, this issue has been solved. But the scammers don't care, they just hope that you don't know any better. Moving on, the ad says the charger is equipped with revolutionary QC3.0 technology. Okay, so QC stands for Quick Charge. It is a fast charging standard developed by Qualcomm, and version three came out in 2015 over eight years ago. So that's not a great selling point for a new charger. In addition, QC 3.0 is only compatible with select Qualcomm Snapdragon processors, which means it does not work with iPhone despite the scammers showing multiple iPhones throughout the ads. Now, let's talk price. The ad says QuickCharge Pro is $37, and they justify this price by saying, \"Hey, if you buy this, you don't have to spend $1200 to $1,800 on a new phone every year.\" This is very misleading because most people don't spend that much on a phone anyway. According to SellCell, the global average replacement cycle for a smartphone is 3.6 years. And I also ran my own poll on Twitter and YouTube. Out of 995 Twitter votes, 39% of people said they upgrade every four plus years. And on YouTube out of approximately 9,300 votes, 48% voted every four plus years too. So it's very unlikely that people are buying new phones as frequently as this ad makes it seem. And even when they do finally pull the trigger and buy a new phone, they're not spending a ton of money. And according to a US phone arena survey, only 17% of their respondents said they spend more than a thousand dollars on a new phone. So I think it's pretty clear this ad likes to exaggerate and bend the truth too much. Yeah, it's rough. Before I continue tearing these fake chargers apart, metaphorically and physically, I'd like to recommend actual good chargers from Ugreen. The Ugreen Nexode Pro 65 Watt mini packs 65W, and three ports into a tiny design. It features two USB-C ports and one USB-A. And just to emphasize how small this thing really is, here is my 67-watt Apple power adapter. You can see it's a fraction of the size, yet it offers similar wattage and triple the ports. You can charge an M2 MacBook Air from zero to 51% in just 30 minutes, or you can charge three devices at once. And it's all thanks to the Airpyra tech and GaNInfinity chips. But I'm not done yet, Ugreen also makes docks. The Ugreen Revodok Pro plugs into a single USB-C port on your laptop, and suddenly you transform that port into a 10-in-1 docking station with two HDMI ports with multi-monitor support. Up to 4K at 60 hertz for two displays and up to 8K at 30 hertz for one, a five-gigabit-per-second, USB-C port, a USB-A 3.0 port, two USB-A 2.0 ports and gigabit ethernet. You also get two card readers for full-size and microSD, and you can charge your laptop with the USB-C pass through up to 85 watts. So go ahead and get your own Ugreen chargers and docks with the link in the description below. So now back to the bad chargers. I tell you I can nitpick this QuickCharge Pro ad all freaking day, but there's bigger fish to fry. So let's take a look at ad number two. The second ad talks more specifically about reversing the age of your phone's battery, restoring it to mint working condition in three weeks. This is impossible because the damage a battery naturally receives through aging is chemical related. Let's face it, batteries are time bombs. Okay, not that violent, but batteries undergo recurring electrochemical reactions. These oxidation-reduction reactions or redox reactions occur every time electrons flow from the battery's anode to the cathode, which discharges the battery and powers your device, and vice versa while charging. So it's only a matter of time before the anode wears out and batteries lose capacity, or even worse, get puffy from gas buildup. Mm-mm, gotta love those spicy pillows. And that's just from regular use. If your phone battery experiences excess heat or it gets punctured or there's an impact that could shorten the life even further, and no phone charger is gonna magically fix these issues. And really, phones are smart enough to optimize your charging to maintain the battery health. You don't need an external accessory to achieve that. For example, your phone's, hardware, and software will allow your battery to charge at a higher wattage until a certain point, but then it will slow the charging with a lower wattage for the remaining percentage. Moving on in this scene, the ad shows four phones charging really fast off one charger. Let's ignore the overheating problem for now. This is still impossible because the QuickCharge Pro directly on the product says it will only output at 18 watts maximum, that's the Quick Charge 3.0 limit. Now let's talk about MIT and this Steve guy. No, no, not that Steve guy, this Steve guy. First off, you spelled professor wrong in the lower third, yet you spelled it correctly in the baked in captions. You can borrow my Franklin spelling ace if you need it. So Steve and the narrator talk about carbon nanotubes. These are a real thing and they can be good conductors, but they're not used in all electrical applications. But Steve and the narrator insist carbon nanotubes are in the QuickCharge Pro. But the way they word it, it makes it seem like they're talking about the cables that connect your phone to the charging brick. I think there might be a language barrier issue here or something, but when the advertisers say wires, I think they actually mean the traces on the physical printed circuit board, but those are typically copper, we'll find out soon. And even if this thing had nanotubes in it and everything was more efficient, it doesn't matter a ton to the phone because QC 3.0's 18-watt limit isn't going to magically increase just because the brick itself is a little more efficient. Also, I had Pixel Peeper 3000 to a quick analysis of the scene, and bingo! Steve Gibbs is from this stock footage on iStock and apparently it was filmed in Russia. So what's up with this patent claim where big tech companies pooled their resources to try and stop the QuickCharge Pro from being manufactured? Well, the narrator said this case is still ongoing. I usually keep a pretty good finger on the tech community pulse, and I've never heard of this story, but certainly there's gotta be a news article about it, right? I googled a few keywords and found absolutely nothing that backed this claim up. These fake back stories are being used to invoke scarcity, threatening the buyer with a low supply. The advertisers are forcing a sense of urgency upon the buyer so they can make that sale really quickly. However, in reality, there is no supply shortage. Ultimately, my B.S. meter is like fully overloaded with these ads, but as you can maybe guess, this scam doesn't end with the video ads. So let's take a look at their web presence. Oh, a CloudFlare screen, oh joy! It looks like the host is down. I don't know why this happened because when I started investigating these guys two months ago, this landing page was active, but thankfully I've cracked the code on time travel, so we can take a look at this website. Hey, Old Man Ken, you almost ready? - Almost, I just have to attach the power for the time machine. - Plug it in man, let's get going. - Yeah, I don't really think this extension cord is rated for 13 jigawatts. - Just do it! - Okay, oh gosh. (dramatic orchestral music) AAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!! - That didn't sound good, I'm sure he will be okay. He's got a pacemaker. Alright, let's time travel. Mm, I can feel it, I can feel it forcing through veins, let's do this. (electric whooshing) I think it worked, not much changes here. I think we're two months in the past. Yeah, we're two months in the past. This is the landing page from the link in the first YouTube ad's description. Thanks to space time travel, we can now see it. The top of the page says zero to 100% in only 15 minutes. The website reiterates on some of the ad claims. For example, this device can reverse the aging process of your battery and heal past damage. The fake reviews back this up, Gary Woodward, if that's your real name, says, \"The QuickCharge Pro reverse the battery damage on his iPhone 11 and it charges to 100% in 15 minutes.\" Gerardo says, \"When my watch or phone starts getting low, I just plug it into my computer.\" Wait, you plug it into your computer. Why not the QuickCharge Pro? What are you reviewing here? So that was the landing page I discovered, pretty simple, but despite it being offline today, the main QuickChargePro.com homepage is still accessible. The homepage brings you to a country selector. And when you choose United States, it brings you to an entirely new domain, QuickChargePro.io, and the site looks very Razer-y. Weirdly enough, if you choose another country like Venezuela or France, it brings you to a completely different looking webpage. And this is where things get interesting. Suddenly the bogus claims are gone. Well mostly, they still call it a revolutionary charger, which it isn't. But the 15-minute charging claims and battery-healing claims are gone. Instead, the charge time claim is now 70% in 35 minutes. So it seems like whatever team is behind this decided to be more honest and they corrected their mistakes, and I applaud you for that. Thank you for the honesty. I still think it's crazy you're selling this thing for $38. I mean, I'm okay with paying more money for a good charger, but you know, it has to be good. This thing looks really cheap, but hey, prove me wrong. Only one way to find out, I went ahead and bought one. I time traveled back to the original landing page and clicked the 50% off button. The purchase page sneakily defaults your selection to two units valued at a ridiculous $152. In my case, I actually want to get to, because I have a feeling one of them might get a little bit damaged when I try to open it up and see what magic is on the inside. I press the complete button, and ding, the purchase was complete. Oh look, a post transaction upsell and another, and another, wait! This might be the special cable we need, you know, with the carbon nanotubes. Oh no, it's just copper. So while we wait for the QuickCharge Pros to arrive, we need to talk about something important that has come up multiple times in my past scam busting investigations. It's called dropshipping. In a nutshell, dropshipping is a fulfillment method in which a brand ships an item directly from the supplier to the customer. Typically, this brand is operated by a single person, and these individuals never keep inventory of the product. So if this business owner/operator isn't keeping inventory or physically shipping the product, what is their actual job? Their job is to provide a storefront and marketing campaign to get people through the sales funnel and buy a product. This is a legit selling method, and there are people who play fair. The barrier to entry is really low, which can overall be good, but it allows bad players to enter the ring. And unfortunately, this leads to scams and counterfeit goods, fake AirPods are a big one. On the plus side drop shipping can be good for people who want to run a business, because it's got lower overhead than a full-blown operation. But there's downsides to this, shipping times can be long, the individual or business behind the drop shipping operation can't perform quality control because they never actually see the product, which means they also can't provide proper customer service in some cases. And the products are usually very generic because they typically can't be customized to a brand's image. However, some suppliers offer custom packaging at additional costs. So that's drop shipping and this whole QuickCharge Pro operation just reeks of it. But good news, the chargers are here now, let's take a look. Yeah, it's pretty much what I thought, it feels super cheap. It looks really cheap too. And there's already a bunch of scratches on it, like I haven't even done anything with it and it already looks scratched to heck! And on the back here, hmm, BK, not Burger King, unfortunately, model BK-376. That must be the actual name of this Power QuickCharge 3.0. Even though the ads call it QuickCharge Pro, it looks like the real name is Power QuickCharge, 'cause again, this is some dropshipping product, a generic product that anyone can buy and resell under whatever name they choose. And if we look this model up, we can find out that it is available on Amazon for $9 from the generic store, that sounds lovely. Yeah, definitely not worth $76. And this new egg listing shows a total output of 48 watts, so that's good to know. Now we have a number, and the side of this thing says five volts, three amps max, which means not counting the Quick Charge port, A port can deliver 15 watts of power. The charger also supports nine volt, two amp, and 12 volt, 1.5 amp, which both equal 18 watts, which is the max wattage of Quick Charge 3.0. So there is no way you're charging a phone to 100% in 11 or 15 minutes. 15 to 18 watts is just not enough power. And even if this charger did have enough power to deliver to your phone, your phone would still have to be able to accept it, different phones have different limits. And really, USB-A, which is what these ports are, they're not made to deliver a lot of power. USB-C on the other hand is particularly USB-C PD, Power Delivery, which can deliver up to 240 watts of power. But this magical charger isn't using that standard nor anything similar to it. But we're merely looking at the outside. Now let's take a look at the inside to see what's truly going on. And since these products aren't being manufactured anymore or so, I'm told, we can't risk damaging this unit, so we need to approach this disassembly with delicacy and grace. (CHARGER SMASH!!!) Yeah, this thing was completely sealed in plastic, so I had to take a more... smashy approach. This is why I bought two, right? So yeah, there's the insides. We see various components, different types of capacitors and resistors and some LEDs. We also have an inductor and a transformer. These are typical components you need in a phone charger or a power adapter depending on who you're talking to. Nothing special so far. There's additional integrated circuits on this board. And between Quantum Infinity, Branchus Creations, and I, we were able to identify these components like this bridge rectifier and this DC-DC converter, but no matter how hard we searched, we couldn't find a component indicative of any sort of magical operating system overriding or battery healing capabilities. To hypothetically achieve this, you would need an SoC or some sort of processor to do the computational tasks. But those chips require many more pins or balls if you're using a BGA than what we see on this board. So it's highly improbable, this board is doing any sort of magical smartphone overriding, and I think it's just cool to now finally see that with our own eyes. But we like to have fun here, right? So let's have some fun and pretend this thing can actually communicate with your phone and attempt to heal the battery. Will you actually notice battery health improvements? No, because again, battery aging is a chemical problem and no phone charger is ever going to solve that. But I know of one thing we can solve, the carbon nano tube mystery. So let's take a look at those traces. Yep, just look at that color, that is copper. What a crock of sh- So now that we have a comprehensive understanding of how the scam is structured, and we know what's inside the QuickCharge Pro, there's only one thing left to do, let's take it for a test pin. Since the ad shows a lot of older iPhones, I'm going to use my iPhone 7 for part of the testing. I will also use my HTC 10 because this phone is Quick Charge 3.0 compatible. I plugged in my iPhone 7 and started the stopwatch. As I approached the 15-minute mark, I was drawing 7.5 watts, which checks out because iPhone 7 can accept about 10 watts max. The test has been going for 15 minutes, so this is the big moment of truth. What is the percentage at? 18%. Not surprised. The iPhone 7 took two hours, two minutes, and 35 seconds to reach 100%. So that's way far off from the four to 15-minute claims in the ads and on the older landing page. Now let's try the HTC 10, almost immediately when I plugged it in, it started drawing a higher 17.2 watts. So it looks like Quick Charge 3.0 is working, at least the 18 Watts specification is. And the lock screen is indicating we're charging rapidly. We hit 22% battery at the 15 minute mark. We'll check back in at the 35 minute mark to see if we hit 70% like the website says. In the meantime, quick side note, I was surprised that the QuickCharge Pro is actually quiet. It's nowhere near as bad as the multi volts coil whine. (electricity buzzing) Okay, we're at 35 minutes and we hit 50%, which I believe is acceptable because the HTC product page claims up to 50% in 30 minutes. This difference is likely due to the HTC 10's design. It's probably not the charger's fault. We hit 100% charge in 1 hour and 35 minutes. Again, nowhere near the crazy claims, but in reality, that's a decent charge time for a 2016 phone. I think I've made plenty of arguments as to why the QuickCharge Pro is fake. Don't waste your time with this cheap crap. Get a better charger if you need one, and hopefully these scammers will finally shut the duck up about these groundbreaking chargers. Thanks for watching, and subscribe and stay tuned for my next episode where I talk about the $100 Laptop. Ooh, it's green! Catch the crazy and pass it on.

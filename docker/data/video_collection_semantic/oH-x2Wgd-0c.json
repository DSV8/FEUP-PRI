    "transcript": "- The Eluktronic's liquid propulsion package. Really? What a let down. I am so disappointed right now. Over the years, we've seen tons of finished products with obvious oversights. (upbeat music) And a couple of months ago, we had one such product arrive the Eluktronic's liquid propulsion package. It was promising, but there were a ton of small problems that needed fixing. And apparently they have all been fixed which raises a few questions. One, should we give them another chance? - [Crowd] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Two. Should they have saved themselves some trouble by just sending us the prototypes in the first place - [Man] Definitely - Thank you. And number three, should brands give us even more money in exchange for sponsor reads like this one? Definitely. This video is brought to you by- - Hetzner, for a limited time, Hetzner online is offering all ax dedicated route servers with AMD rise and CPUs, no setup fee configure yours today using the link below. (upbeat music) - Eluktronics doesn't want me to take it apart until after I've tested it. Well, did you already test it Alex? Do I have to worry about that? 1, 2, 3, hup! - [Alex] Geez. - What is all this stuff? Okay. We got the LPP G1. That's our liquid propulsion package. They sent over some peripherals. I actually like their little warranty card thing. They say, \"Hey, warranty is only in the US\" which does suck but they also clearly explain why because they don't have the parts and the facilities available to service them elsewhere. So like, you're gonna have to ship it back to the US if it comes to that. Okay. Fair enough. The star of the show is of course the liquid propulsion package an external water cooling unit that is designed Here we go, to make the Eluktronics Prometheus 17, faster, quieter and cooler. - [Alex] They said not to open it - What? Well, I can open this. - [Alex] No, they said not until you've done the testing. - Oh, okay. The problem is that last time around they did manage to make it both cooler and faster but it actually came at the expense of both noise and ease of use. The pump and fan were super loud in here. And these fittings at the back would just leak. When you unplugged the external liquid cooling system did you never see that clip, David? - [David] No. - [Alex] They might still do that. - Oh, they might still, oh my God. I thought you said they fixed stuff. - [Alex] They fixed stuff, but I don't know if they fixed all of it. - I admire, but I don't envy the small one person band content creators out there. It's like, \"Hey, is all my pre-testing done?\" Yep. Yes, love my team. Not just Alex. He's just the closest one right now. - [Alex] I'm physically closer than him Linus. - That's true, actually, David I'm pretty sure I gave you some love earlier today though. Alex contributes nearly nothing to our production values. No offense, Alex - [Alex] What? - [David] Wow. - [Alex] I do sometimes. - I mean, jankiness is sort of a production value. - That's not fair. - The sickness of this laptop was kind of undermined a little bit last time by the kludgy cooling solution that didn't work very well. It's really cool. Our power goes into the external cooler and then there's a pass through to the back of the laptop. That way both devices are powered off of a single wall outlet - That wasn't on the last one. - Yeah, see, it looks like a little like replacement plastic do dad but it doesn't have any screw holes. So I have no idea what it's supposed to do. And you told me I'm not allowed to open it but look how tempting this is. Shouldn't I open it. He wants to open it. Yeah. This is way better. The fill part at the top on the old unit was so loose and it just had a hole. So if you accidentally knock this thing over or your cat knocks this over, boom puddle of water, Digi laptop, Gigi, external cooler. You're done. Ah, look at that. Just like that. Okay. Quick release fittings. And then it pops off like that. One of our big problems on the last one was that the water left in the laptop would just leak out. I hope they fixed that, but quite frankly I do not see any mechanism to address it. - [Alex] Hmm, did they give us any way to like add the water? - Yeah. They gave us this funnel. - [Alex] Oh wow. That's almost worse that syringe they had last time. - Yeah, if I don't leak any of this it will be a Christmas miracle. - [David] Shall we move it further from Eluktronics? - Well, that was actually pretty good. Oh I just squirted into it. It seems to be in standby. You see this, David? How it's kind of flashing like that. - [David] Yep. - 'Cause core temperatures are like 40 degrees. I would not expect that with liquid. Hello? - [Alex] Oh, you're spilling you're spilling. - Oh okay. Oh, oh, oh. It's gooping out the front, okay. Well that was an issue we had last time too, wasn't it? That it was possible to like overfill it - [David] There's a little indicator on the front. - Oh, Eluktronics really doesn't seem to be able to figure out which way is the front and which way is the back on this thing? You got the tubes coming out the front. This is where the visual fill indicator is. This is where the power button is. But then this goes into the back of the lap. Like, is it supposed to sit way back here? Who has a desk that deep? Like I would wanna kind of here. Okay. Liquid propulsion package control. Inject liquid don't use tap water. Yep. Okay. - Also do not use cryo fuel. Apparently some of the plastics in there will embrittle and break if you do that, so don't - Wait a minute. The second I paired via Bluetooth, it got silent. Either, it's way better or it's way worse. Oh, here we go. Quiet please. I said, sh these are cute. It's quieter than it was last time. - It's not quiet. - Did they tell us it was going to be quiet? - Yeah. - Maybe I'll give it a little, you know let's see if the LED control works this time. I wouldn't describe it as the world's brightest LED. It's very dim. These menus are hilarious. Your path you must decide. Overclocking may cause system instability, please adjust parameters carefully. - That's your path, you must decide? For the processor we're just gonna drag it to 140, right? - [Alex] Yeah. Why not? - And then for our core and memory clock offset for the GPU they actually provide, look at that, little guidance. So they'll tell you, yeah you can do about 150 and 1,000 megahertz. It's still a little on the loud side but it is definitely better than last time. We're sitting here at like 20% CPU load, 30% CPU load launching programs, core temperatures like 35 to 45 degrees. Love to see that. Remember this is a 3080TI and it's sitting at 32 degrees at idle, well, 3080TI mobile it's limited in terms of its TDP. And it simply cannot be unlocked. So you got 14 core up to 64 gigs of memory, RTX 3080TI mobile. And like, look at it. Obviously that hardware is not gonna run to its full potential. When you don't have the external liquid cooling hooked up, like, look how fricking thin this thing is. But man having the option to have most of that performance on air when you're on the go and all of it when you hook up the external water cooling unit that is a lot of times by extreme frames per second. I mean if you told me a laptop is gonna run the 4k extreme preset even just a few years ago, like this. - Yeah. Now do you wanna know something kind of funny? - Sure. I like funny. - We recently had a sponsor project that fell through. - Oh really? - That had the same specs as this laptop because it was too slow. And we were like, that's embarrassing. We're not gonna name in shame because that would be rude. But it did have fairly similar performance to this out of the box, just on air cooling. And it was pretty similar in size. It had slightly worse performance and it was slightly thinner. - Okay, and we rejected the sponsorship just because we thought it was stupid that the specs were so high and it was so expensive but the real world performance was so low. - Yes, but this allows you to, you know, have a laptop that's like this with this kind of hardware and it's not stupid. - Right. I mean, it's a little stupid. - It's a little stupid, but it's not exactly the same performance as a 3070TI or in many cases. - Oh, I see what I'm looking at here. This thing had a 3080TI and a 12900H and it was getting beat or tied by an R9 6900 HS and a 3070TI. - Yeah. - That's embarrassing. - It is. Yeah. - I feel like even though we've made this video already where we talked about how laptop specs are just completely misleading now but I feel like we could do it once every six months and it would still be really valuable information for the consumer. - Well and also, it depends so much now cause like if you have the same cooler that you had three years ago it was fine then. Now you need a vapor chamber or you're going to get destroyed by alien wear and ACEs. - Yeah. Oh - [Alex] That's a clean 800 point improvement. - That's outstanding. That's that's more than 10% better. And we haven't even tried to tune the over clocking dials past what Eluktronics recommended. This is that this is the safe settings. I love it. Maximum temps on any CPU core 81 degrees Celsius. - [Alex] Yeah. So that's a 13.4% increase. - And our GPU topped out at 55 with the hotspot hitting 64. That's outstanding. Hopefully this man is to launch here. The thing is when you're over clocking a laptop there's a lot more at play than just cooling. Even if you've got adequate cooling and the Silicon was capable of it. You gotta think about the power delivery. The entire power budget for this device is dictated by this little AC to DC adapter right here. And generally speaking, their board designs are much more space constrained than they would be on a desktop where the board of an RTX 3080TI might actually be a similar size to the entire motherboard of this laptop. Like we've seen some big 3080TI's. - [Alex] Oh yeah. - I am satisfied with the noise level of this thing given that it is running performance benchmarks right now. I think that what I would wanna see if Eluktronics wants to take it to the next level is intelligent fan and pump control where if I'm idling, it just turns off. And maybe it has an indicator to say, \"Hey, I'm in standby.\" And when you actually do something and you need cooling I'm ready to go. But I'd like it to turn off when I'm idling because this thing was actually super quiet until the pump kicked in. Right as we're sitting here making a video about how we think products could really be better. If brands consulted with us before they released the darn thing, we got a consulting opportunity in my inbox from a major hardware brand. For a product that is very interesting. And that we could probably provide really great feedback on. - Yeah. - The question is, should we do consulting? - 'Cause there is one thing that making this video allowed Eluktronics competitors to do. Just let me get that for a second. - Ooh man. And the plot thickens. Wait, what you've got did you really just pull out a competing device? - Yeah. - Look how red he is. Eluktronics had no idea. Look at the color of his face. It's red than the hat, which you can get a LTT store - Eluktronics actually knows. I had a talk with them. - Oh did you? - There it is. - Wait. - [David] No way. - Holy (beep). Oh wait, what. Did they buy it from Eluktronics ? Did they completely clone it? - No, they were in parallel working with the same manufacturer and were like, oh (beep), we have all these problems. - That's the thing. Product development is crazy expensive. I guarantee you that every one of these plastic molds every single piece of this was at least a few grand. Okay. And probably more, probably closer to five, 10 grand. You gotta sell a lot of freaking little external water cooling units to make up that initial outlay. So the more brands that you can partner with, to help share that production cost the better. As long as they don't find out. 68 30 our score is officially legendary, Alex. - Damn, oh wait, did we get- - Look at this curve showing results from the same hardware? See ya, (beep) later look at this. This is us. - Can you hit compare results online? Like what percentage are we? - That's incredible. And you know what? This just does such a great job of illustrating what we're talking about because with mobile devices, right? These are mobile products. If anyone is not getting the performance we're getting it means they're getting less than what this hardware is capable of. So they're being hamstrung by power delivery. They're being hamstrung by cooling. They're being hamstrung by profiles that are set by the manufacturer. And you can see on the same damn hardware you've got people getting scores that are literally 30 40% lower than what is capable of. And to be clear, I'm not saying that every device should be two inches thick - Every device with a 3080TI should. - And he's not wrong because it actually does need that cooling in order to reach his full potential. Except this one doesn't - Do you not wanna check out the other one. - I do wanna check out the other one. I'm just look, I have too many things to be excited about right now. I can't believe you totally blindsided me with this. I love it. It's thicker, but that makes sense because you're gonna need to have at least some air cooling in it for when you're not running water, but there it is. That's the same external water cooling thing. - In fairness, Eluktronics and XMG don't really compete. XMG's in Germany. If you're in Europe, you buy from them. - We are better than 59% of all results submitted to 3dmark.com. That is absolutely outstanding that we have completely left behind just about every machine in the world running this hardware. All we need is another couple hundred points to be the world record for this hardware. - Now Eluktronics does have one other little thing that we can do. They worked with prima mod to unlock the bios. So you can actually go in and properly tweak the stuff. - DGP only that might help. - Oh Yeah. - We weren't actually running on the native display. I bet we're gonna beat. - Oh yeah. - We might actually beat it. - I'm surprised because in their software stuff it said that it was dedicated GPU. - While this runs, we identified one of the reasons that you might not wanna show early hardware especially to review channels it could allow your competitors to snip you on an idea with that said, we don't believe that's the main reason because if your competitors could clone your product and or beat you in such a short amount of time you probably weren't dusting for success anyway. The real reason you might not wanna send out prototypes is that well they're prototypes. Typically the fit and finish is pretty crap because a lot of the work is done by hand, which means a couple of things. One the cost of each of those prototypes compared to what that same unit might cost in mass production is much higher. And two, there could be weird errors that could give people a really wrong idea about the finished product. For instance, here are two fairly late stage prototypes of our screwdriver. This one was supposed to be orange but as you can see, it is in fact red. So if you guys are seeing orange right now your monitors color calibration way off. Now our wrong color, not a huge deal. I'd be happy to send a screwdriver. That's just slightly the wrong color to someone like a tool reviewer. But this one here we made a large change to our ratchet mechanism which involved changing the direction of the ratchet. And although it works great, if we had sent this one to a reviewer, we would've been absolutely slayed. And here's why, oh, it's locked. It managed to both slip at, oh, it's locked. Don't worry we have that fixed now There's also the fact that due to the cost and the handmade nature of these things you usually only have a couple of them lying around to give you guys some idea. A prototype of our screwdriver is gonna cost us somewhere in the neighborhood of 200 to $300. I mean, given that our retail price is gonna be about $70. Yeah, it's not gonna be very sustainable if they actually cost that much as for the backpack every sample, the backpack costs about five, $600. So with that said, I'm very happy then that Eluktronics sent us an early sample and is finally letting us see just how far we can push this thing. There's one more thing to check Alex. - [Alex] What? - Whether the water just drains out the back. - [Alex] Oh yeah. Okay. You guys ready? This is the big moment they did not. Okay My laptop made a little piddle. I will say though, that these seal a lot better now. No, there's a hole. Oh my God. No, they're totally designed to like allow the water out. Okay. Well, that's interesting. That would prevent pressure from building up if it was still full of water and it heated up and it would prevent it from like gushing out at some point. So that's good. - [Alex] I guess so. - In conclusion, I'm really pleased that Eluktronics sent this to us early and allowed us to be part of the product development process. I think they ended up with a better product at the end of the day. They weren't able to fix everything that we were unhappy with about it, but it's a way more compelling offering now because we can say without compromise, this is the fastest gaming laptop that we've ever laid our hands on. And all it costs you is this extra liquid propulsion package and a little bit of extra noise at idle. A lot better than where we started. With that said, it's clear that there are challenges for manufacturers when it comes to sharing information with us early and the whole field of consulting for the same manufacturers whose products we're supposed to be covering is fraught with potential conflicts of interest. So let us know your thoughts. Should we do more stuff like this where we're looking at products early? Do you guys want stuff to just be better? Would you trust us to still cover something that we actually consulted on? I have no idea. These are very unchartered waters for us. How do uncharted waters? Ugh.

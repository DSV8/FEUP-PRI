    "transcript": "Hey everyone, it's Colin. How's it going? there's a collection of Mac aficionados who are very passionate about their computers and Often know way more about how they work than the average user But these people didn't buy their machines from Apple they built in themselves this time Let's talk about the hackintosh So the hackintosh it's probably a term that you've heard But in case you haven't it's simply the concept of running Apple's Mac operating System on non Apple branded hardware and it's been going on for quite a while now but to fully understand the movement behind this we need to take a look at Apple's history because what's going on now is a bit of a repeat of what's happened before you see Apple has always tied its software and hardware together in its product It was always wanted to control the whole experience and this concept is pretty well known It's been apple's modus operandi ever since the beginning But what's not quite so well known is that there have been clone Apple products throughout the year also Pretty much since the beginning there have been Apple 2 compatible machines like the laser 128 and the Franklin a series some of these were completely reverse Engineered and others simply copied apples ROM code and faced the consequences in some cases But even after the Apple 2 there have been many Macintosh clones throughout the decades early clones like the outbound laptop used the ROM chips from an actual Mac in order to function, but by the mid-1990s Apple began to officially license its OS to clone manufacturers and a whole ton of different machines appeared on the market some of them from companies that Popped up just to build Mac clones others from existing Mac vendors that hadn't built their own full computers before and Some even from vendors that were well known and decided to branch into the computer market but clones ultimately hurt Apple for various reasons and So around the time that Steve Jobs came back to Apple in the late 90s the licensing program was effectively just killed off so that brings us to the mid-2000s, and that's when Apple announced its switch from the PowerPC processors to Intel's x86 Platform it said that for the previous several years. It had been secretly building versions of its Mac OS 10 Operating system that ran on the x86 platform and this was a bit of a bombshell to people it Was around the time pretty well rumored that Apple was going to be making that switch to Intel however, what people figured was that transition to Intel would take quite a while that Apple would announce maybe its first few machines and It would be kind of like going through the original OS 10 transition again where things were pretty buggy and didn't necessarily work all that great right off the bat it would take some time to get there but the fact that Apple had been planning that Intel transition for several years prior and Had actually worked a lot of the bugs out of the Intel version of its operating System really floored people. I remember being very surprised not at the news of moving to Intel but at the fact that Apple had actually basically been doing it for quite a while and the transition to Intel on Apple's own Hardware was actually Incredibly smooth the machines I came out were very fast very much a better value and the big thing was Apple was able to completely change its entire product lineup PowerPC to Intel in just the span of a little over a year It was actually very quick and it was fairly painless Especially since Apple had written in a softer translation layer to be able to allow PowerPC apps to work natively on Intel hardware at Relatively decent speed but the big thing Behind that transition is that it also not only meant like faster computers for the average Mac user But for those who are technically inclined it presented a really interesting challenge I mean since Mac's were effectively becoming regular PCs a lot of them wondered well Could OS 10 be run on standard hardware and the answer ended up being yes And thus the Macintosh became a PC and the hackintosh movement was born so it's been around for over a decade now and The novel team I would say has probably worn off by now so why do people still build hackintosh is I mean I think the original appeal was really just the classic to see if you can do it type of mentality That novelty has worn off. Why are people actually still going to the trouble of building a hackintosh? Well, I'd say it's largely for the same reason that people bought those Apple clones throughout the years first to get better specifications or control over the hardware Mac's have continued to become more and more integrated and offer more and more limited hardware choices, especially with at this point the fact that they are pretty much not upgradeable or Expandable if you want to Like in a few years, maybe make your Mac more powerful You pretty much have to get rid of it and buy a new one, of course going to a hackintosh well kind of eliminates some of that because it's a feature that PC users have been enjoying since the beginning if you want more RAM if you want a bigger hard drive if you want to put In a faster, sir Expansion cards anything like that. Well, the sky's pretty much the limit and even to some extent for PC laptop users Although the story has been kind of changing for them, too But it's it's really that idea of taking control of the hardware and being able to decide exactly What parts and pieces you want in it to best suit your own needs? maybe you have specific demands and requirements that Apple's current lineup of hardware just doesn't meet all that Well a great example is the kind of mid Performance mid-price tower PC market Apple hasn't really offered kind of an every, you know, average everyday just tower that you can plug your own monitor and keyboard and mouse into It's always been the low end That is the Mac Mini or the high end with the Mac Pro but nothing right down the middle where? People like me could very benefit from it I don't necessarily need a workstation class computer But I'd like something with a decent amount of performance and some upgrade ability as I want to maybe further with What I'm doing in terms of multimedia content that sort of thing that transition from 1080p to 4k video required a pretty decent bump in processor performance and all that for a lot of people who are into creative work and multimedia content that sort of thing it would very much benefit them and I think a lot of those people are the ones who have gone out and Jumped on this hackintosh bandwagon because Apple otherwise doesn't sell a computer That suits their needs all that. Well, otherwise, they would have to go into a much more expensive machine the other reason why I think hackintosh is still relatively popular these days is because of price Apple's machines for a while were actually pretty decently price Compatible with what you could get out of a Windows PC and I've done a video about this that everyone loved to give me shit about but There have been specific machines throughout the years that have managed to hit really decent price points That were fairly comparable but that's been changing over time as some products have simply not been Updated in quite a while or other products have been pursuing an even higher end type of user like the iMac Pro that starts at $5,000 yes you Could say that's a comparable machine in terms of price to a windows-based workstation But again, it comes back to that hole in the product lineup I think a lot of people who buy an iMac Pro don't necessarily need an iMac Pro. They simply need something more powerful than The other machines that apple offers So by building your own machine You are able to pick those parts and you can often get a better Price for it overall than if you were to buy a machine actually from Apple So with all that in mind, why hasn't everyone just gone and built a hackintosh I mean when Apple's clone Program was official in the mid-90s those clones almost killed Apple because they were so much better Priced than the machines that Apple was putting out themselves well, there's a few reasons and I think one of the biggest ones is that it can take a lot of effort to build a hackintosh, and it still doesn't have guaranteed results You see the hackintosh community relies on being able to basically work around limitations that Apple builds into the operating system Apple doesn't want to make it easy for you to run Mac OS on Hardware that it didn't sell you now thankfully those limitations have been relatively minor throughout the years and fairly easy to circumvent the hackintosh community is full of very smart and very talented people and they generally figure out ways to work around what limitations there are and Continue to move that platform forward But things like hard drivers have always been a challenge Apple only needs to include drivers in the US for Hardware itself sells and builds into its own computers Sometimes those drivers are reusable with standard PC components like ones that define the platform architecture or chipsets that sort of thing and other times they don't maybe there's a Particular piece of hardware you want to use that just will never work because no one ever wrote a driver for it Maybe it's a fairly esoteric piece of hardware. And if you don't know how to write drivers yourself. Well, you might be stuck so Some people have managed to kind of hack their way through some of this Modifying drivers or simply swapping out parts for ones that work well enough with the out of box drivers in Some cases some third-party manufacturers have actually gone to the trouble of writing Mac drivers Nvidia is a great example NVIDIA has for quite a while now been offering Mac drivers for its video cards ostensibly it's to Officially support the people running the old light cheese grater style Mac Pro's that did have user replaceable video cards in them But I'm pretty sure Nvidia also knows that a lot of people running those drivers are installing them on hackintosh is and not official Apple hardware and I also personally kind of think that Nvidia is maybe a little bit salty at Apple because Apple used to do business with Nvidia and even had some Mac's based on invidious chipsets and for the past several years Apple has been really leaning heavily on AMD for graphics so maybe the whole driver things a little bit of a middle finger towards Apple but in any event Drivers have always been an issue but there are even sites like Tony Mac x86 and the OS 10 x86 project that will recommend specific parts to give you the best compatibility down to the point of saying like if you buy these Exact makes and models of parts CPU motherboard Ram hard drive all of these things These are you know parts that they have gone through verified will produce a decently running hackintosh with the minimum amount of work and In some cases it can be fairly easy if you're willing to go down that road but if you want to do something a little bit more out of the norm or a little bit more difficult like Hackintosh a laptop in some cases you are completely on your own But even then if you can get a hackintosh built and running there's still always some risk not just in building that system but in keeping it running and Updated at any point Apple could release a new software update that just completely bricks your system either intentionally or not, maybe some drivers got updated that limit compatibility with some of the non apple hardware or Maybe Apple just says enough is enough and decides to make some dramatic changes To the operating system that allow it to continue to work on official Apple hardware, but effectively kill off the rest of the community But that does raise another really good question. Why doesn't Apple just stop hacking toshing? I mean, it's got that history of knowing that clone computers are bad for its business with the way that it does business Why has Apple continued to tolerate it well in in the past? Apple has actually gone after the hackintosh community, but it's generally only been when hackintosh azar being sold Famous example is a company called psystar And this is not to be confused with that Gangnam style guy But they were a company that around 2008 started selling hackintosh estate at a web store You could just pick out all the parts you want say I want this to be a hackintosh and they would sell you a complete Machine that you would, you know, take it out of the box plug it in turn on and it would boot into the Mac OS Well Apple of course caught wind of this and took them to court citing a copyright violation and of course Apple won and so psystar went out of business in 2012 and indeed it technically is Illegal to build a hack and even if you don't plan on selling it Because of specific language in the License Agreement for the Mac OS and also just general concept of copyright infringement Apple you know, if they really wanted to they could go after the sites that provide info about building these machines But why don't they well, I have a few ideas One is that the community is still relatively small? So it's maybe not worth apples time Another is that hackintosh builders often go for the latest and greatest hardware when they're building their machines They want to build something that's often even better than what Apple offers So it's quite likely that Apple keeps an eye on all of this not just from the whole legal perspective But I suspect that some of apples engineering groups keep an eye on the hackintosh community Because they want to see what the community is doing where they're going with parts. And then what? Troubles that community is facing in a way They could be using the information gleaned from the hackintosh community as a bit of like free R&D to help shape its future products But I think the biggest one really is that those who build hackintosh --is or power users especially given the difficulty that there can be in actually building one of these and Those power users are also some of apple's staunchest supporters They build hackintosh is not as a nephew to Apple But rather because they just love the operating system and don't really like what Apple's doing on the hardware side They could much more easily install Windows on their hackintosh Be way easier to do that, but they don't So if Apple were to go after the hackintosh community They would have a very big and very vocal backlash That would ultimately cost apple quite a bit of bad PR even though it didn't really impact a whole ton of people it would compound on a lot of the things Apple has been doing that's been pissing off even those who by actual Apple Mac products now all that said I Do think the future of hakkon toshing is in doubt and I suspect those who are even deeply involved in the hackintosh Community have had this go through the back of their minds as I mentioned in a previous Podcast it's rumored that Apple is going to be switching from the Intel chip platform 2 a.m to ARM based chips in maybe the next few years I think it's clear that apples become a bit unhappy with Intel and its rate of progress and Apple has been getting a lot more performance out of its arm-based processors That it's been using in things like iPhones and iPads over the last few years It seems like it's able to push that platform along quite a bit faster So it's generally being accepted that within the next few years Apple is gonna start transitioning Mac's over from Intel to arm and when that happens well That's going to be the beginning of the end and ultimately hackintoshing will die off when Apple stops shipping x86 versions of the Mac OS So I guess you could say in a way while Apple has periodically lost this battle it's been losing the hackintosh battle for 12-ish plus years now ultimately in the coming years it will end up winning the cloned computer war so With all that said I'm curious as to your thoughts. Do you have experience building a hackintosh? Are you using one right now? Have you tried it in the past has it worked out for you, or has it been too big of a challenge? I've tried it a little bit here and there throughout the years and sometimes it's worked really well. Sometimes it hasn't but ultimately that worry about long-term support and whether My computer will even work the next day after a software update has kept me on actual Apple hardware, but Maybe that's the same for some of you. Maybe it's not I'm just curious as to your thoughts So be sure to share them down in the comments below Also if you're interested in audio only versions of these podcasts I have them available as plain mp3 downloads for patreon supporters You can also get a private RSS feed throw it into the podcast player of your choice and these episodes go live a few days before they show up on YouTube So it's a great way to help support the channel Anyway, if you like this one, I would appreciate a thumbs up be sure to subscribe if you haven't already you can follow me on Twitter and Instagram at this does not comp and as always Thanks for watching",

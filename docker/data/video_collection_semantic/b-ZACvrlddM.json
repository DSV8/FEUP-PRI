    "transcript": "So today we've got some headphones. Couple of them in front of me here, and I know you've seen hundreds, maybe thousands of videos on different headphones, not just here on the channel, but across YouTube. But usually I'm looking for something unique. These are called the Wearhaus Arc. What's different about these is that these have something called \"wireless audio sharing\". Sync up with nearby Wearhaus headphones and listen together. This is about socialization. This is about being able to share in the same media that your friend happens to be listening to. Well guess whatif you're at school, you're in the cafeteria or something *boom* just link from yours to theirs and they can kind of DJ. Let's say, for example, someone has a movie on their laptop on an airplane, you're sitting next to them. This is an elegant way to both be watching the same screen and listening to the same source on your own independent headphones, and you're doing so wirelessly. So there are some use cases in which this might be interesting: customization of color so you can actually control the color, touch control so you can tap the side. And then they claim there's precision-tuned audio. Here, you can see 40-millimeter driversthat's pretty good, up to 30 meters of syncing range, up to 15 hours of battery life. You could have like your own silent party. You know, maybe that the neighbors constantly complaining. I mean, it would be a weird look. Alright, it's got me thinking, let's check these babies out. (slicing tape) Ooh. Oh! Bit of an unboxing experience here. Look at that presentation. It's an on-ear style, but if you push down into the earcup there's like a concave in there, so we'll see how I like that. Generally, I like around-the-ear style but this is maybe a hybrid. Here, you can see the controls on the side (sticker peels off) beautiful. Shows you how the touch controls work. An auxiliary cable Is there a mic? Yes, a microphone here, and buttons. Oh, sweet, look at that. Create a station, it's like your own radio station you're broadcasting. What your battery life is in percentage It will tell you what's playing if you have a song playing. And this is also where you can broadcast, join stations and switch the light settings. Wow, so check it out. I'm listening to a podcast right now. \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" You can see the artwork now showed up. \"Now playing\" (faint music) (audio demonstration through microphone) Volume-wise, I've tested a lot of Bluetooth headphones which don't get me the juice i'm looking for. These things are banging. I can move around the color wheel, and that's kinda nice. It It moves in real-time, and then there's a few different multicolored options also. Get in here, Tom, brother. More Tom! More Tom! More Tom! More Tom! Guys, thumbs up if you can't get enough of Tom, thumbs down if you're fed up. He's like, he kills somebody *uhh* *uhh* *duh!* Ok, so there's Tom solos, there's my solos, so I click on the broadcast button over here, and I can name my radio station. \"Big Lou's Audio Extravaganza\" Is that how do you spell \"extravaganza\"? Now on Tom's side, he's going to join the nearest station *Boom!* he just joined the Extravaganza, and I'm broadcasting from my head I feel like, uh this is the closest I've ever felt to being a radio DJ right now. You're on *my* watch brother. Prepare to have your life changed. (background music) Who'd it belong to, man? I don't know. Didn't look like mine. DJ BIG LOU! Why am I screaming any of that? Are yours as loud as mine? Oh ho ho, *man* I'm getting blasted here! Okay can't hear anything. I'm getting blasted! We're going to switch over to SoundCloud. Did that work? Oh, ok. So I completely changed audio source. I went from Google Play Music, into SoundCloud now, and Tom is still in the mix. You want you want you want freestyle to this? No. You want to freestyle to this? Sure. They already saw me freestyle, so I know nothing (wheezing laugh) \"I know nothing! There's nothing that I know!\" We could rhyme right now. It could be a whole circle of people. *He* could be involved. Yeah, but I would be the guy listening to you, like, \"That's good. That's great. You know?\" No no no. *slam* *slam* I give him a *slam* Is that when you're hitting the snare? Wu-Tang classic. Yeah, the snare. Mine's delayed. They have to be in sync or this is pointless. Imagine we were watching a video: Delayed. Delayed. It's a couple of frames delayed. To me, that's totally watchable, like, the lips are ever so slightly ahead of the words. Music is going to be less of a problem, Yeah, oh yeah. 'cause if I'm playing a song for you, as long as you don't hear mine, mine are blasting as long as you're not rap battle Why are yours not playing anymore? Why is my phone not working anymore? Listen, they're a little bit finicky on the connectivity between the two. Slight delay, and then at times, connection's on and off. Theoretically, a lot of this stuff could be fixed through software updates, new apps When it's working, it's kind of a cool concept. That slight little delay, I think some people might have an issue with it, others probably not so much. It's a pretty cool concept. How much do you care? I think it's quite interesting, actually. Scale of 110 The Tom Care Factor Neat. Whoa! Alright! Tom, surprisingly, there, he is usually on the lower end of the spectrum. So, uh there you have it. Tom Give Tom your thumb (chortle) right where it counts. (chuckles)",

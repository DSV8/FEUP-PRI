    "transcript": "oh no not another massive cod update as we wait though what are you guys running for audio i'm on the new black shark v2 x pretty good budget option going directly into my motherboard i've actually been using the g pro x from logitech with its own usb sound card it does the job i am running the trusty gsp 300 from sennheiser and trying something new the epos gsx 300 epos what is epos yeah epos that's what i said what the fudgicals is epos it's a new brand why don't you google it okay so there's epos watches there's the european plate observing system it's also european pediatric orthopedic society no no no ippos audio there's the confusion yeah that would cause some brand confusion so let's talk about this whole brand separation of all gaming products from sennheiser that are now under the epos umbrella just a few clarifications it's not like a separate brand that bought sennheiser it's a different division within sennheiser that separated and is now epos so all existing gaming products from sennheiser have the epos slash sennheiser uh indication while moving forward from september or whenever they release new products it will just be epos carrying over the exact same technologies as what's been developed from sennheiser just under a different brand i think it will take some time for epos to gain some popularity and brand loyalty because you see the sennheiser logo this is instantly recognizable and immediately adds value while epos doesn't really so in this video let's talk about the gsx 300 the new external usb sound card from epos i will be comparing it to the gsx 1000 because that was the original and it still is one of the best surround sound usb sound cards on the market and we'll also compare it to the shit full of three which is a 99 dac amp combo also geared towards gamers because of that mic input i really hope that epos will be able to fix all the driver and software issues that i've experienced with sennheiser products in the past and i'm hoping we don't stumble upon in this review all right let's begin right after this the new gala had all-in-one coolers by liam lee combining premium materials for a beautiful package to cool your intel or amd cpu with black or white color options available both with tasteful aluminum housing and complementing 120 ml argb high static pressure fans and you gotta appreciate proper length fan screws the water pump is excellent with easy installation cool pattern with vibrant lighting control with the hub or vau motherboard and rotatable housing to match your orientation and don't forget the aluminum magnetic cap for a different look check out the new galahad all-in-one coolers by liam lee down below so first of all i would say buying an external usb sound card for gaming is not necessary in 2020 because most motherboards have really good audio amplification and pretty decent microphone quality as well i've done both audio and microphone testing on different motherboards and external solutions you can check out those videos here but the reason you might want to pick this up is literally for convenience mainly using this with a notebook or if you're moving computers and you want to still carry over the same audio that you're used to this is primarily why you'd want this in terms of physical characteristics it's a fairly small unit available in black or white but the black model i have here is not exactly black it's kind of like gunmetal gray we have some rubber pads at the bottom and the unit is angled to kind of face you which is nice at the front we have a volume wheel with beautiful tactile steps so you can control exactly how much volume you're adding or removing it is not a button so you cannot like press it to mute beside it is a button that you can function either enable surround sound mode or switching between presets in the back we have a micro usb connection and your headphone and microphone inputs the volume adjustment is also instantaneous without any delay and the only way to mute it is to go all the way down so it's a really simple and basic usb sound card and the one thing they all share between the full shield 3 the gsx 1000 and the gsx 300 is a really short usb cable so if i plug this into my machine i don't have much flexibility on where to position it on my desk so what i'm interested in is really hearing the difference between the full sheet 3 the gsx 1000 and the gsx 300 in terms of power output in terms of clarity sound stage delivery and the overall character and i'm really interested to hear what the surround sound implementation is like on the gsx 300 which is so much cheaper than the gsx 1000 which has incredible binaural engine built in and we'll see if any of that carries over the gsx300 is the only one that has any software included because the gsx1000 has all the controls on the actual unit while the 403 is completely driverless inside the gaming suite we have all the usual eq customization and profiles lots of microphone controls which i appreciate and the only thing you can map the smart button to is to either change your profiles or enable and disable surround sound i really wish that you could map it to mute as well all right so let's begin with the power comparison using the gsp 300 a fantastic 99 headset it's a 19 ohm device at 113 db sensitivity so you don't require too much power to drive this thing and with the fuller 3 at 60 volume i'm more than comfortable driving this with beautiful low end tones and overall smooth presentation moving on to the gsx 300 and this thing requires almost 100 volume to drive this headset properly there are audible crackle when you change the volume so like each step is kind of like it's not distracting and it's only present when you are changing volume the one advantage of this thing though is that it delivers a fuller sound versus the fulla 3 and it has better stereo imaging giving you slightly wider sound stage in a default mode not even enabling the 7.1 surround sound as for the gsx 1000 so this thing is slightly more powerful at 70 volume i'm comfortable here so it is more powerful than the gsx 300 but they share very similar sound characteristics nice beautiful body and the low end not too sharp on the high end uh and the slightly wider sound stage than the fuller three moving on the headphones we have the hd58x this thing is incredible sound wise build quality eyes value wise 150 ohms and 104 db sensitivity using this with the gsx300 more volume is desired just because it's an open headset so you do eventually kind of lose out some of the detail you might want to crank up the volume in order to maintain everything in the headphone but we have great tones and still good detail even at 100 volume the gsx 1000 is slightly more powerful so at 70 volume it's about equivalent to what you get at 100 with the gsx 300 but this thing to my ears has more sound stage pickup especially when you're listening to live recordings it's like your ears are there instead of the microphone and the 403 of course is a lot more powerful has no problem driving the ht500x but it has a slightly flatter and neutral sound signature so i actually prefer the characteristics of the gsx sound cards and moving up to something even more demanding the hifiman he-4xx these are planar magnetic drivers and even though they're 35 ohms their sensitivity is at 93 db which means i had to bump the volume to almost 100 with the 403 and this thing delivers beautiful tight base with nice smooth high end using the gsx 1000 at 100 volume this is not a sound card for headphone that has low sensitivity but it was a perfect example on hearing the difference between the sound signatures where both the gsx cards have slightly fuller body on the low end and like more pleasing tones whereas the fulla 3 while it is incredibly powerful delivers very analytical clean output while both gsx units have warmer presentation more pleasing sound slightly wider sound stage by default and the gsx 300 i wish it had slightly more power to drive something like the he-4xx because everything about the sound signature i like in this sound card and the bass while still very tight is slightly more airy than what you get with the gsx 1000 and the 403 especially when it comes to planar magnetic headphones alright so let's move on to the microphone test next as for microphone quality this is what the gsp 300 headset sounds like via the gsx 300 sound card it doesn't sound so good now but watch this simply enabling that worm preset for the vocal enhancer significantly improves the vocal quality it doesn't only add the bass but really improves the entire spectrum you also have gain control side tone that doesn't work for some reason noise gate adjustment and noise cancellation this is what the gsx 1000 sounds like it is quite sensitive there is active noise cancellation applied it's not too aggressive but there's a bit of like compression happening it's not the most natural sounding microphone back to the gsx 300 and the really unfortunate thing is that throughout my testing and recording sound samples and listening to them back as i was about to start recording a sound sample for the 403 the microphone jack appeared to have died there's no microphone signal going through and that means there's definitely something wrong with the fulla 3. but the gsx 300 with the warm preset sounds fantastic and before we conclude the surround mode on this thing is actually quite good for 79 dollars i am impressed it's not as good as the gsx 1000 we don't have as many features but we do have a reverberation slider so you can customize how big or small your space is but put on some headphones and hear the surround mode for yourself one huh so after you've heard that what do you think about the surround node i think it's controlled well for a 3d audio environment for open world games it's a benefit with reverb at minimum i find it helps to smooth out the stereo separation gives you more of a 360 degree rotation for audio and it does sound quite good while maxing out that slider gives you speaker like playback in front of you without making things too distant or eating out too much of the detail i still find the soundstage expansion and 3d world with layering to be better on the gsx 1000 but for 79 this is an absolute recommendation if you are after surround sound but that of course if there were no issues with software which is a perfect segue into driver issues a surprise surprise so first of all the epos gaming suite does not actually show up in the taskbar when it's open and the only way to access it is through the hidden icons or finding it in the apps i don't know why it doesn't simply open up as an app the site on feature on my unit does not work even when adjusting the slider i still cannot hear the microphone and the smart button ah it's not so smart after all it works fine switching profiles but it for some reason does not actually work when you're trying to enable surround sound or stereo all right so here's an example what i'm talking about i am physically clicking the button on the gsx 300 unit and you can actually see the mode changing on screen right um but i don't actually hear the difference in audio so nothing is being activated it's only when i physically navigate my cursor over the button and click it that you can actually hear that surround sound mode or stereo mode being applied which is super bizarre and this type of bug is not allowed to happen even though it's a fairly inexpensive unit the fact that we have a button called smart button that you can change to do either this or changing profiles i don't get it it really is unfortunate that on every single sennheiser gaming product that has drivers i've encountered all types of bugs and issues and the gsx 300 is no different which is so unfortunate because for 79 it has plenty of power to drive gaming headphones has a really good microphone quality especially when you enable the warm preset and the surround mode for the price point is brilliant especially with the reverberation adjustment lowering it to minimum gives you slight sound stage expansion but maxing it out gives you really large speaker format that feel like they're in front of you so make sure to subscribe for our ultimate gaming sound card amp combo comparison because i have like seven and we'll do similar testing as we've done in this video but yeah i hope you enjoyed let me know which microphone sounds best to you and the surround mode improve your experience based on the headphones you wear i mean for me does but not for everything all right i'm dmitry thanks so much for watching check out this other relevant content subscribe for more i'll talk to you in the next video",

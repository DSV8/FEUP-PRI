    "transcript": "(Presenters singing nonsensically) - Hello, and welcome to This Is. The biggest gaming company in the world that you all love. - Microsoft? - No, the other one. - Sony? - The other one. - Activision? - The other one, well, they own part of Activision. - Blizzard? - They own part of Blizzard. - Apple. - I'm sure they'll own part of apple soon. - Epic - Tencent! Oh, the other one. oh, I could, I could have kept going- - Actually yeah, it was pretty close (laughs). - Yeah. Epic. Yeah. So Logitech and Tencent have announced that they are partnering together to create a cloud based gaming system. And that's really all - Wait. - we know about this at the moment. - Hold on. Hold on. Is it logitech, logi, or logicool? Logicool is the best one. I'm just saying. - What? Do you not know what I'm talking about? - Yeah. - So logitech in different regions have different brand names. - Okay. So in Japan, it's logicool? - Logicool. Then there's logitech, which is in, I think the U.S. And then I think there's just logi. As this is head of streaming news aficianado, - Yep. - You got the steam deck one hand. - Yep. - You got your theoretical Xbox streaming stick in the other. - I'm building that. Don't worry about it. - Tell me about this. Okay. So Tencent, obviously a massive, massive company. - Here's the fun fact. We don't know. They just said, Hey, we're doing this. - Okay. And it's gonna work with multiple streaming platforms. That's the whole, like, news article. - So the stick, the logicool stick. I'm just gonna call it logicool stick. Logicool stick. - This is going to have multiple streaming apps running on it. Theoretically, you could load GeForce NOW, PlayStation, Xbox, whatever the case is. So the two that we can safely infer- - Yeah. is Game Pass, we can safely infer that because Tencent and logitech have already said, hey, we're working with Microsoft on something. - Makes sense. They're loading on TVs and everything they can get their hands on. Okay. Got it. - Same with same with NVIDIA. - Right? They're creating a streaming stick. - You Keep saying stick. And I find that interesting. - Or box? Package? - Because they haven't mentioned whether it's gonna be a stick, whether it's gonna be like a little console, like the old PlayStation TV. - To me, a couple of takeaways. So first of all, it makes sense that Tencent is a massive gaming company, now- - The largest in the world. - if you're not familiar with Tencent, you really should be because Tencent owns a huge, huge amount of games studios. Now a lot of people associate Tencent with a lot of, like, free to play mobile games, which is absolutely a way that they make a lot of money, but they also own a very large stake in things such as Epic. - Fortnite. Maybe you've heard of it. - Unreal engine. - Riot, which I believe they own outright. They own a big chunk of Ubisoft. They own a big chunk of Bluehole, which makes PUBG. - PUBG. - They own Supercell, which-, - Yeah, the biggest- pretty much any mobile game that you can think of that makes money. - Clash of Clans. - Yeah. They did not come out and say we're making our own console. - Right. - Did not say we're making our own PC. They, no. - Do they have any cloud infrastructure? 'Cause the way I understand Tencent, they typically, their games are mobile, more so. - Depends on how you wanna look at it. - Okay. - Because the infrastructure that they have spent the last decade building,- - Yeah. - has all been internet cafes in China. So they have specifically gone out of their way, over the last, about 10 years now,- - Yeah. To bolster as much of the internet cafe market in China as they can. Okay. They've teamed up with Tim Hortons. What? - It's a Tim Horton's- - You Canadians are holding out on us. You gotta share. - It's Tim Horton's themed eSports internet cafe. And the reason they've been doing this, is because a lot of people in China are still using internet cafes to game. They were dwindling for a while, and about, like in 2013, they really started to pump all this money into opening up new cafes. At one point they were doing 20 million active users in these internet cafes. - A lot of people. - The vast majority we're playing two games. - Wait, wait, let me guess. League? - Yep. - And Dota? - Dota was a big one. - Okay. - Crossfire. This is like the definition of vertical integration. - Yeah. - Tencent opens up internet cafe. - Yep. - People rent Tencent's PC,- - Yep. - to play Tencent games,- - To spend money on 10 cent micro transactions. - Yes. And then they refresh themselves with Tencent beverages. - If only they were drinking delicious Boss coffee, available at Boss coffee's website. - So, you haven't sponsored us yet. - And that, if you spend all this time talking about cloud gaming, yeah. I can try to shill for future sponsors. Hang on. You just talk,- You're gonna- I'm gonna register Austin's sponsorship. - We're in the middle of video. Don't register domain - sponsoraustin.com - sponsoraustin.com! Oh my God. Such a good idea. I now own sponsoraustin.com. Go to sponsoraustin.com for all the information you need on how to get your fine beverage, food or other various tchotchkes. If you have an idea, that's not lttstore.com. Please reach out at sponsoraustin.com. Continue. What were you saying about cloud gaming or something? - A teeny tiny thing in the world has thrown a big wrench in- - A big wrench? - Tencent's internet cafe plans. - Wait. Can I take a guess? Yeah. - Is it the COVID? That's not the only thing. There's a lot of things that have caused another decline in internet cafe sales. First one is The Vid #TheVID. - No. - Obviously, COVID was a a big thing for it. - Yeah. Especially in China - But apparently their 5G infrastructure is very good, as we did a little research while we were filming. - Kenzie looked it up- - Yeah, I didn't- - and said, China, 5G, good. - This is just a prop. It's not actually real. But then PC parts in general, are like, it's easier to get your hands on a PC in China than it ever was. People don't really need internet cafes nearly as much as they used to. It's still like a cool place to hang out. Now Tencent is like, well their whole thing has been all these free to play games, that they're making all this money on. Yeah. If they're playing a free to play game. But they're still playing it on our computer, our micro transaction, whatever. They still need to have those players come back and play their games. Well, if people can't afford a console to be imported into China, because every time we do a video on on a PC or a console, everyone's like, because of import taxes and everything like that, this console is suddenly triple the price. - Well, 'Cause in a lot of areas, a computer is taxed- - Yeah. - differently, because a computer can be used for other things. Whereas a gaming console is, generally speaking, just for gaming. So it typically has hire associated, like, customs dues and whatnot. - You know, like, if they're trying to get people who don't wanna play on their phone, which you don't wanna do for one reason or another, suddenly if you have a device that you can get AAA games, because that's the thing, is most phones don't do AAA games. - How dare you insult Genshin impact. - Again, we've talked about the real benefit to cloud gaming, is to open it up to as many people as possible because specs don't really matter. - Yeah. - Obviously your internet matters. - Yep. - But if anyone can bring cloud gaming to the world I actually think it is Tencent, because it's all over China. - Yeah. - Like, whereas Microsoft has had, made the best platform, but they don't have the infrastructure yet to make it mainstream. - So, I'm gonna be curious, is this just a pure hardware play? If this is just a stick to sell, that can run a bunch of streaming platforms. That's cool. That's neat. It's not the most ambitious thing. But if Tencent starts really focusing, or even just putting some resources into getting more of their games on the cloud, it just does seem like one of those things where my gut on this is that this is a little bit more of an experiment for one of the world's largest companies. And specifically one of the world's largest gaming companies to get their foot in the door of streaming. - I agree- - But I don't know how serious it is. - Well, I mean, I feel like it's serious enough, that they're partnering with logitech. They could partner with some, a much smaller company. - Or they could just make it themselves. - Right. If they wanted this to be like a, yeah. An experiment. The fact, I think, that they're going with a company like logitech, I thinks there's- - They have worldwide distribution. - Yeah, exactly. - Lots of, you know, the supply chain's sorted out. Like they,- - I think this is mainly because they're gonna treat this the way that apple or Google does. You might be playing Game Pass on your Tencent device. - Yeah. But Tencent's taking a big cut of whatever you do in micro transactions. I think this is one of those things, that for the most part just benefits the consumer. Tencent can be charging 90% of the commissions on this, whatever. But as long as it's seamless to the consumer, which- - Yeah, I don't care. This seems neat. - Yeah. - And I get it that as the president of the cloud gaming association of federated gamers worldwide Inc LLC - We're working on the acronym - But I'm not quite seeing the vision. - It's very reasonable that you don't see the vision because, all we have in the press releases, hey, we're doing this thing. - We're doing a thing. - Here. We can mark my words. And you know, when this actually comes out you can tell me how wrong I was. - Love it. I think this thing is gonna be like a hundred dollars. It's gonna be as cheap as possible so- - What do you think it is? Do you think stick, you think console, you think handheld? - I think it's gonna be a as cheap as possible device. Okay. A hundred dollars. I think tops. I mean, in the U.S, I mean, obviously. We're talking. - Do you think this actually will see worldwide and or U.S. release? - Yes. - This does- - Yes. - to me feel maybe like more of a China play. - I think it won't be big in the states. - No, but you think it'll show up. - I think it'll show up. I think like, I think we'll easily be able to get our hands on this and test it out at some point. - Okay. They're putting all this R and D in manufacturing. I think it's a pure play for China. - Yeah. But they will it trickle it out. - Look, why would you partner with someone like logitech, if you didn't want worldwide distribution. - Look, Matt, these are some bold claims and you know, there's only one way to find out. - To wait and watch and check out other episodes that This Is- - No- - where you could tell me - Matt. - about how- - To subscribe to This Is! - You gotta get some feeling. - Subscribe to This Is! - Matt may have broken the microphone, but what you can do is break the subscribe button. - Ring-a-ling that ding-a-ling bell and make sure to stay tuned to This Is, 'Cause you know that the second that this thing shows up and is mediocre or cool or whatever, your boy Matt's gonna be like, (clapping exitedly) Cloud gaming! Cloud Gaming!",

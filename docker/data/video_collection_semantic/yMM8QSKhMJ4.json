    "transcript": "in today's video I learn how to master truck foreplay. 'I think that's how you turn it on?' break some plastic. ' oh it broke.' and get confused by a flap, 'what is, what is this for what does this do but first today's video is sponsored by the new Corsair RX 1220 IQ link series of fans they're the new strip down entry into the IQ link ecosystem with its very convenient single cable management and fan daisy chaining which makes PC Building A S the starter pack even comes with the little IQ link brain but funnily enough my favorite part about these new fans is their new fans screw which may sound stupid but look at how easily that screws down it's like two rotations it's amazing so check out the Corsair RX 1220s using the link down below [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] now of course it was only a matter of time before somebody built something like this I mean I'm surprised it took this long I still haven't figured out how the io works on it there's bits of PC poking out the bottom but I don't know where you plug stuff into it but I'll figure that out eventually the wheels turn look at that it drives around and not only that but they've got suspension so that the whoa these wheels are so dodgy attached look at that wobble but anyway when you drop this bad boy down and you kind of I think that's how you turn it on I think that's the power button is you just kind of Boop it on its nose and it turns on no way the problem is though when it's on your desk like this the back wheels are free so when you oh although it does break a little bit when you when you press the power button so yeah I don't know maybe it's not a problem it kind of sticks in place I'm curious to see if the doors open I think they do they kind of look like they do and why would they tape them down if they didn't oh that's some strong tape oh you can open the doors that's exciting and then presumably you can kind of cut your finger off with it oh no it's actually it's surprisingly safe that's very unrealistic of it oh the frunk even opens it's got lights I think when you power it up it is going to light up on the front so excited to see that I don't think you can close the back but I guess it means you permanently have storage in the back of it for all of your memos about crypto scams and misogyny or whatever it is that cyber truck owners need to store there is a USB port over here but that's a really terrible location for a USB port because the thing needs to only be that long and that's only an option if you're me so I don't know how that's going to work does the io work I'm kind of hoping it's you kind of open the back oh oh is that the lid that but this little latch seems to have broken my monkey brain cuz I just couldn't figure out what it was for what is what is this for what does this do this also looks like it opens oh oh the back just breaks off that is very realistic it's exactly like a real cyber truck the moment that you put any pressure on the back it just rips off and totals the truck that's a very nice authentic touch right there and then its IO just hides in its butt and its butt IO is very usable although you'd probably still need at least a dongle the one thing that I'm concerned about though is I don't know what this is for maybe it's just there to hide cables and stuff oh it's not very sturdy if your desk is skew now in terms of specs this little cyber truck's kind of packing the company that makes it sent over the most well-endowed spec which has a ryzen 7 8845 HS in it a pretty high-end laptop CPU now unfortunately we don't get a dedicated graphics card but the ryzen 7 has a little vestigal my GPU which as far as I understand it is surprisingly capable but before we torture this little Cod piece with some real demanding video games let's strap it down in my oet and tear it apart so we can see how it's constructed and for our own sick enjoyment whichever comes first tearing it down is immediately exciting cuz I think our cyber truck has an upgrade glory hole on it going to pop that off and then there's a huge piece of thermal pad for some reason this lid is plastic so it's not going to really conduct thermals very well but still we've got access to our SSD without having to break down a bunch of stuff so that's a really nice touch ooh Some gen 3 nvme action now I think going any deeper is going to be a bit of a mission because we have to get the whole bottom off and the build quality feels real Tesla so I hope I don't break it [Music] oh wow that separates out real easy and it's not separating out in the way I was expecting it's just the whole bottom of the car coming out here's the little PCB that connects all of the lights and power button and stuff up uh which uses a ribbon cable to connect to the PC in in the kind of center of it and there are a couple of pcbs that extend out like this with a single LED on it which is presumably for the tail lights then this is just the shell of our cyber truck next I think we have to remove the seat plastic bit which has a real made by metel feeling to [Music] it oh there we go wa the PC is actually attached to the bottom oh there's a ribbon cable holding this all together now kind of lift that off and then oh no I think the ribbon ca's actually glued down yeah okay I'm going to remove this PCB so I can get to the the ribbon cable connector open that [Music] up so there they go and then oh we have our little PC W that looks so much like they just found a laptop motherboard in a parts bin and then glued it to some plastic chairs there are even a bunch of connectors on the side which you can't plug in because it's blocked by the side of the car these down here kind of look like they're ribbon cables for like displays keyboards and other stuff that normally comes on a laptop but having said that it's a pretty nice looking laptop motherboard we've got decent cooling we've got dual Channel RAM on our cyber truck PC that's awesome and we've got upgradeable storage and stuff so you know they could have found a much worse laptop motherboard in a parts spin now the back wheels are extremely basic we just have like an axle running between the two wheels and it's just held in place by a bit of plastic wa this front wheel is so janky it feels like it's just going to come off uh but but in terms of its suspension you've got this little plastic pin that moves up and down with the spring and then oh I don't is it supposed to move up and down oh it broke wait how did it break I barely touched it yeah so this side is an example of how it's supposed to work so you got the the little Peg that comes through the body with the spring but where's the power button oh that's how it works okay that is the power button that you have there next to the the front USB 2 Port that faces down into the body and when the suspension pushes up this bar pushes and hits the button okay I see how that works now cool okay so with the mysteries of the surprisingly rudimentary construction of the little cybertruck PC unveiled let's fire it up now in order to power our little Burba cyber truck it uses quite a beefy 100 watt external power brick which means despite it not having a dedicated graphics card it should be able to game reasonably I think its igpu is pretty [Music] powerful it does the lights are happening now in terms of the clap because this system is basically DIY we don't get any it's just a clean windows install and what's also promising for our gaming performance is that our Apu is fed by 32 gigs of ddr5 running in dual channel so lots of memory and bandwidth to go around [Music] round look at that at 1080p low settings Counter Strike was a little bit stuttery there but we're getting over 100 frames per second wow this is so much better than I was expecting I mean I guess it's because the last time I interacted with an APU kind of gaming situation I was getting 10 frames per second here so I don't think me being impressed by it means much now temperatures are quite giggy at the moment which mixed with the pretty substantial noise coming from the Cyber Tru is a bit weird to me considering how much cooling is inside the Cyber Tru so apparently trucks drawn my children aren't great vessels for airflow who would have known now moving over to Doom maternal at 1080p medium settings we lose a decent amount of frame rate and gain some temperature for our effort but it's a very playable experience which again compared to what I've been experiencing recently is an impressive change fortnite can happen on this system very good at 1080p low cyberpunk isn't really doing what I was expecting it to do look at that frame time graph we've got a seven on the rter scale happening there that's not great I mean I'd say that it's borderline playable oh here is a truck in cyberpunk and it looks more like a rivan if anything oh here's a second one now I was really excited to play dystopian Future video game on dystopian present pickup truck but it's not going great even even with quality FSR on here I mean I'd say it's playable but it it really doesn't feel very good even cranking Fidelity FX up to Performance didn't fix the crazy frame pacing we had going on here so I decided to try a different demanding game to see if the issue is also present there now with the last of us we don't have the earthquake happening in our frame time graph which is good it it feels a little bit better but I mean the frame rate's not as high as it was with cyberpunk here at 1080p though I think I forgot to say that uh so it still doesn't feel great but turning Fidelity effect on balanced made it a lot more playable just like that we've got pretty good visuals still and we've gained enough frame rate for the game to feel good like this is definitely a playable experience that we're getting from a cyber truck Mini PC so I think that's pretty impressive yeah I guess when you use one of these AMD apus in a Mini PC one of the like higher end ones you're going to get a good gaming EXP experience out of it for the hardware regardless of if it's in a cyber truck or some kind of marital Aid so at the end of the day this gateway drug to cybertruck ownership is a thing that exists and if you have money you can buy one that's about as much as I have to say about it so uh yeah thank you for watching and until the next video bye-bye [Music]",

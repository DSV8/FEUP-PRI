    "transcript": "- The countdown is officially on. It is Apple season. Now in previous years, we've all gathered together in Cupertino at the Steve Jobs Theater for the iphone, iPad, Apple watch and the new iOS release. And at this point, all of those things would have already been announced. But this year much like pretty much everything this year that has been completely thrown out the window. So WWDC was virtual. So this is gonna be very similar to that. Now, most likely the rumors are suggesting that this Time Flies event will only cover up the new Apple Watch, iPad and maybe AirTags. Maybe HomePods or maybe some new AirPods Studio, but we're not really sure. But there's a really good chance the iPhone 12 event is getting its own at the end of the month. Since the supply and demand of resources has been pushed so significantly due to COVID, this is now potentially pushing the release of the iPhone date to a later time in October. So this does make sense to get everybody all hyped up about the new Apple Watch and all of the goodies. And then save the best for last. I wouldn't say the best for last, because I love my Apple Watch so much. Anyway these are all rumors things that I've kind of pulled from the internet. I will put all of the links to all of my sources in the description below. I don't have any other crazy information that you guys can't just search for yourself. But I'm kind of taking it all and recapping it all here in one video for you. I also plan on doing a live reaction recap after the event. And also a very special edition of our new podcast. We just started our YouTube Channel this weekend so if you guys want to go check that out youtube.com/samebrain. And we'll be posting a special Apple event podcast there shortly after. Probably a little bit longer after 'cause we have to edit it so just be patient. So the Apple Watch, I would say is probably one of my favorite tech devices almost of all time. Of course other than the iPhone. But this has helped me so much over the past few years really quantify my health. Now the leak say that there has been some code found within iOS 14, that could suggest that the Apple Watch is finally adding blood oxygen detection. Now I actually use this O2 ring sensor And I test mine at least once a day to make sure that I'm least in the 96 to 99% range. Now with the integration of the sleep tracking into the new watch OS I also think that this will have some sort of improved detection for that as well. So many of these leaks have been coming from code that they are pulling out of the various Boch OS and in iOS 14. Like this, there's a possible new kid mode for kids. Now this could go hand in hand with this other rumor of a new, cheaper Apple Watch SE, possibly made of plastic and lacking some of the features like ECG and blood O2 to cut costs. I think this really does make sense because obviously if you are going to want to try to make a cheaper version of the Apple Watch, they're gonna have to use more inexpensive materials and not have all of the same features as the Apple Watch. I wonder if they're gonna call it the Apple Watch Pro or like the Apple Watch Mini or the Apple Watch SE that's kind of what the internet is saying that they think they're gonna call it. Also looks like they might be removing the Force Touch on the Apple Watch as well, but they do plan on keeping the general design sort of the same. which I'm actually very glad about because I have so many Apple Watch bands that if they do change the design too much, we won't be able to use any of our old bands. They do always add some new finishes or some kind of visual cue on the newest Apple Watches to let know, \"Hey, this is the newest Apple Watch. I just want to let you all know it's subtle, but it's not as subtle enough that you're not gonna able to see it and know that this is new.\" Next up is the iPad. It looks like there's gonna be an iPad 8 and an iPad Air 4. That we did just get an update to the iPad Pro like a few months ago with LiDAR and a spec boost. So unless they plan on releasing another iPad Pro, I feel like that's not very realistic. These iPad Air 4 rumors are based on a pamphlet that was leaked a few months ago, or like last month or something. Now this looks like what is usually included inside of the box But it shows a more iPad Pro looking iPad Air with the possibility of Touch ID built into the side button with USB-C. I love the iPad Air, but I also really love my iPad Pro so kind of taking that form factor over the iPad Air, making it look a little bit more like the Pro and adding a fingerprint sensor is just I'm, I'm here for it. The ipad Air has always been a very popular choice for its size and its cost. But it really desperately has needed an update. As for the iPad 8 I would probably imagine it's gonna get an updated camera maybe dual camera probably no LiDAR, but maybe also Touch ID. I mean if the Air is getting that, I feel like that's probably something that the iPad 8 should have as well. I mean I don't really know, this is just something that seems logical. I haven't really seen any info that suggests that they'll be doing an update to the HomePod, but I do have my fingers crossed because I love my HomePod. Now I think if they did some sort of HomePod Mini or really just freaking updated Siri so that she would work would also suffice. I mean like she works but then like she doesn't. I mean the HomePod has been out for a couple of years. I feel like there's been some rumors of potential discontinuation of the HomePod. I mean like it'll still work, but I just don't know if there'll be an update. which I hope there is because I love my HomePod so much. I really do have them in every room. So really no matter where I go in my house, I'm never alone. AirTags could finally be making their appearance this week. These are the long-rumored tracker tags that they have supposedly been working on. I used to always use towel trackers for all of my things. But now the only thing that I'm losing is my sanity. Is I don't ever leave the house. So, if we can get an AirTag for that, that'd be great. So that's what we potentially have to look forward to in addition to maybe another event later this month. I mean, I don't know who knows. Does anybody know? I don't know. I'm sure people would Apple know. Maybe Apple will be like Xbox and see that everyone has already linked a bunch of stuff and just troll themselves on Twitter, like Xbox said, and just give us all of the actual info to dispel all of the tornadoes of rumors. Speaking of which, let's go through those really quick before I let you click off to another video. So it will be 2020 iPhone 12 lineup is supposedly giving us four new phones and all new design, a 5.4, 6.7 and 6.1 inch sizes, triple lens, 3D camera, all the displays, five G and an A14 chip. Here's the rubric specs from AppleInsider. And here's what they might look like. iPhone 12, iphone 12 Max, iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max. I absolutely love this purple mock-up, like this is beautiful. It kinda looks like a brighter version of the iPhone 11 last year. It looks like it's gonna be more of a flat stainless steel edge design instead of the curved, which I really like. And there's this all new potential of midnight blue color, which is kind of a very nice contrast. Well, not really contrast, but it's a very similar shade of the midnight green from last year. I actually think that I like the midnight blue a little bit more. So I will be doing a full iPhone 12 rumor video very soon, unless everything is announced at the Apple event. And I will just then recap it for you. So until then, I will see you guys back here on my channel for all of the things. Okay bye. See ya. Time sure flies when you're in quarantine (upbeat music) (beep) Time flies, when you're having fun.",

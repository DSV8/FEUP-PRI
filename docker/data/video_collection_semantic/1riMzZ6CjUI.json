    "transcript": "Something new today the NoPhone. A fake phone for people addicted to real phones. The back of the package claims that more than 10,000 of these have been sold. Now, the Wall Street Journal has been known to report things out of context though, so who knows what the real number might be. But with zero gigs of storage, no Wi-Fi and a solid black display, the specs are interesting enough. But is it durable? Thats what were here to find out. Lets get started. [Intro] The exterior packaging is less than impressive; it doesnt even come in a normal box. But there is a small paper with instructions. The NoPhone is a technology-free alternative to constant hand-to-phone contact that helps you stay connected to the real world. So if youre on a date, you hold the NoPhone and look at your date. But lets be honest, if you actually bought this, you probably wont ever have to worry about that situation. The front of the NoPhone is obviously the side with the home button and earpiece. Its even got a front facing camera. Well start with the scratch test. My Mohs picks tell us where the material falls on Mohs scale of hardness. Most smartphones with a tempered glass screen scratch at a level 6. The level 2 pick has a plastic tip; and the plastic rubbing on plastic doesnt do too much damage. But the level 3 pick started to leave some permanent marks. There arent too many plastic screen phones out there. The Droid Turbo 2, the Galaxy S7 Edge, and the Nintendo Switch; but they do exist. The level 4 pick left an even deeper groove on the phone. People always comment asking how I can live with myself after damaging so many devices on my YouTube channel. And its actually pretty easy. I lost most of my soul paying for textbooks in college. The home button is down at the bottom of the display and its not so much of a button, but more of a pad. And it probably doesnt scan fingerprints very well. It worked just as well after the scratching as it did before the scratch though; so thats good. The earpiece at the top seems to be made out of plastic. And even after being heavily scratched its still 100 percent waterproof. This is probably the only device I will ever say is waterproof. Every other phone is only water resistant. Theres a hugely important difference in the wording. Waterproof is truly impressive. The front zero megapixel lens is covered by the same material that is over the screen. So its going to be equally prone to scratching. The most unfortunate part is is that the camera does not come with OIS, and you all know I aint about that non-OIS life. So I wont be able to make this my daily driver purely for that reason alone. The rear camera is equally lacking in OIS, but it does have that outer lip to help protect the inner lens from damage. Theres literally no glass anywhere to be found on this back panel. And you want to know something else that cant be found? The headphone jack. Which means this solid block of black plastic is eerily similar to the iPhone 7 when it comes to functionality. Now a few hundred years ago in the sixteenth century, France changed up their yearly calendar, moving New Years Day from April, to January. Some French citizens obviously didnt get the memo and continued celebrating New Years on the wrong day. Celebrating a holiday on the wrong day is a valid reason to get made fun of. With time, April 1st became Le poisson davril, or The Fish of April. It became a custom to tape a paper fish to someones back without them noticing. Pranks were a little more chill back then. And thats why a fish is now on the back of this phone. Ill be honest, with all that plastic, I legit think it would be cool if NoPhone released a more premium metal version in the future. A flagship NoPhone. The power button is made of plastic as well. And over here it looks like we have either a full sized USB port or maybe its just a hold button. A full sized USB port would be pretty sweet though. Its time for the burn test. A normal cell phone would last anywhere from 10 to 20 seconds before getting a reaction. Even the Nintendo Switch lasted 15 seconds before the screen got disfigured. The NoPhone started black, and then, well, it just stayed black. But after about 10 seconds it got all bubbly and stuff. At this point you might be wondering what series of your life decisions led you to be watching a grown man scratching a plastic block on the internet. And Ill be honest, Im not quite sure either. But if you need to pause the video and rethink your life, thats okay with me. The rest of us will be watching the bend test. Most phones do survive this ultimate test of build quality. And the NoPhone is no different. This solid slab of black plastic will definitely stand the test of time; whether its in your back pocket, front pocket, or even run over by a semi truck or jumbo jet, its an incredibly durable device. If theres someone in your life who might be a little too attached to their phone, maybe they need to see this video, or better, Ill put a link in the video description for those of you who need a NoPhone of your very own. The NoPhone very well could be an accurate foreshadow of the next iPhone, if Apple courageously keeps removing features like they have in the past. Behind the scenes can always be found on my Twitter and Instagram. And Happy April 1st everybody! Thanks a ton for watching, and Ill see you around.",

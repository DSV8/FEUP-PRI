    "transcript": "what's up everyone Eber here with Hardware Canucks and I just got back from the Oneplus 6t launch event here in New York City and overall my first impressions with this device is that I'm not really I'm not really excited about it because this whole cycled you know the whole cycle refresh every year with oneplus is a little confusing because it all started with the 3 then we had the 3t then we had the 5 the 5t Oneplus 6 and now we're on to the 6t it's their second flagship smartphone for 2018 that's technically replacing the oneplus 6 and just looking at the features standpoint it's again not a significant upgrade over the oneplus 6 just like the 5 to the 5t alright so some of the minor changes with the Oneplus 6t is that they've eliminated the rear-facing fingerprint sensor on the back and they replaced that with a fingerprint sensor built inside the display so they call it screen unlock essentially there's a sensor built inside the display and it is a Morcant it's a more intuitive way of unlocking the device it's I mean oneplus claims to be the fastest way to unlock your device although that's something to be validated scientifically hopefully someone will be able to do that but I'm certainly looking forward to testing that out when I get my hands on with the device next up we have a very slight improvement in the display department so it's a six point four inch AMOLED screen with a tiny like it's a drop notch if you want to call it a miniscule notch you can call it whatever you like it but I actually kind of like the way how oneplus has implemented the notch on the 6t because it looks very subtle very sleek it's not as bad as the one found at the pixel 3 Excel had hands down pick the oneplus 6t over the pixel 3 XL any time of the day because the notch is just it's bearable it's not super it's not you know staring at your face or anything like that so I certainly like that approach but other than that you're getting a slightly you know slimmer chin at the bottom so overall it's not a significant upgrade over the 6 but it's again something I guess it's a subtle look that I'm sure most people would appreciate now one of the cool things that oneplus did mention during their presentation is that they're actually allowing users to independently calibrate their displays so if you want a supersaturated look you can certainly go for that or if you're looking for a more natural presentation on your display you can offer that option as well we're all aware of the different color profiles that are built inside oneplus smartphones so again giving users the option to fine tune and adjust and calibrate their displays is pretty awesome now specs wise it isn't a massive improvement over the oneplus 6 so you're getting the exact same snapdragon 845 processor with 6 gigabytes or a gigabytes of RAM depending on the storage configuration or the model that you're going for I do want to mention that they have increased the battery capacity on the 6t so it has improved from a 3300 milliamp hours to 3,700 milliamp hours so that's definitely gonna increase battery life on the oneplus 6t s so that's definitely something that I'm looking forward to testing and I think that's about it you don't get things like a wireless you don't get things like wireless charging which I was kind of disappointed about because I was expecting that oneplus 6t simply because it's the one feature that I really wish this phone to have but what really threw me away was the removal of the headphone jack because I really hoped that they would keep that but unfortunately they have removed it on the oneplus 6t which is really a bummer I I'm pretty sure most of you guys would agree with me on that but if you have embraced wireless audio then this shouldn't be a concern and for you at all but let me know in the comments down below if you prefer to have the types of the headphone jack or not so again it's a big bummer but interestingly enough this is something that I noticed is apparently they've replaced the headphone jack with a fake speaker grille and I just I didn't know what to say my I was completely stunned when I when I learned about that because just it's just so weird about that because I really wish if they actually gave us two bottom facing speakers and the most interesting part is the speakers are not stereo so it's just a single mono facing speaker at the bottom which is again very unfortunate moving on to the cameras and honestly it's the exact same hardware as the oneplus 6 they're using the same Sony IMX sensors the one thing that they really wanted to focus one focus on was to improve the low-light performance on the oneplus 6t and they've done that by implementing nightscape which is a fine-tuned algorithm that the text night scenes and it fine-tunes majest so that you're getting vivid and sharp results without a lot of noise within the images again that's something that I certainly have to test out when I get my hands on with this device but interestingly enough they did mention that nightscape will be rolled out as an update to existing oneplus 6 users so it's not like a major upgrade and lastly I just want to quickly go over software so the oneplus 6t is rocking oxygen OS running on top of Android Pi so you are X and roid experienced with a few more customization options that Google doesn't really offer so if you really want to fine tune within the settings and make it feel your if you want to really personalize it your way you can certainly do that with the oneplus 6t or just pretty much anyone plus devices that are currently out there running oxygen OS last but not least there's the price so the oneplus 6t is starting at 549 USD and for that you get a 6 gigabyte model with 120 gigabytes of storage if the phone comes in two finishes so you get mayor black and midnight black I really like the midnight black version just because it's a more matte black finish and it's more understated and it doesn't look as glossy it has the mayor black finish again personal preference here but I'm actually really happy with the price point here because at 5:49 I think you're getting a it's its price so competitively well in smartphone market right now because if you really want to get the best Android experience you don't have to spend 600 or you know $700 or even $1000 for that you can certainly get that with something like the oneplus 6t although I'm still bummed about a few features that they were able to remove with the oneplus 6t particularly the headphone jack it's just something that I didn't see coming but honestly it is what it is but I'm going to chime in Dmitry here for a second so that he can talk about his experience using the oneplus 6 for the past six months ever since launch of that particular device just so you can get a rough idea on how that device has been Thank You Eber hope New York is treating you well because the oneplus 6 has been treating me so well for the past six months this has been my daily driver ever since launch and I couldn't be happier this is my favorite Android device to date and it's so funny because when oneplus 6 came out we were already joking about the eventual 6t release because that upgrade cycle is just too short to be six months but you can't get into the mindset of oneplus and then kind of thinking like Apple like oneplus 6 owners will probably not be upgrading to the 6t but the oneplus 5 or oneplus 3 owners will be so that upgrade is definitely looking to be a much bigger jump I've always experienced some form of bugs with one place devices but this one's no different the most recent one which keeps on repeating is the alert slider so when it's in do not disturb and when I switch it back to normal there's like a couple of seconds until all the notifications just come rushing in and it's not like the notification hasn't come through it's just the audio comes through even though I've already received a notification so that's really annoying the fingerprint scanner has gotten kind of slow where I have to physically press into it instead of lightly tapping like I had to on the first device and for the price the oneplus 6 is just like an amazing value and all-around really good performer and I would compare it to my 10s which is super fast but I prefer the speed of the oneplus 6 and that says something about oxygen OS and the 6t obviously is going to just fly right through but in terms of speed and the button tactility the display the speakerphone the headphone jack everything has been working so fine and the only thing that I would give feedback to oneplus on future is to improve on the screen protector the included screen protector because on my red model which looks um I guess so so fire right now and hopefully we'll see more colors than just two with a 6t but the screen protector here that I used for video is just completely scratched up and really poor quality and I guess it's nice to be included but the actual screen on the device is pretty strong it's much stronger than the really soft things that we see with the iPhones and yeah that's one of my complaints for oneplus it isn't exciting update but why did they have to remove the headphone jack I don't understand especially when they were trolling Apple like two years ago that they will still you know keep the headphone jack but I guess that is the trend now and I really like that teardrop you know not or can you even call it a knotch it's a Drudge all righty bruh so my experience with the oneplus 6 has been super satisfactory aside from minor bugs here and there like with notifications which is odd I don't know if it's hardware based or it's something on a software miscommunication there but hopefully we'll see all that stuff kind of like you know smoothed out with the first device with the one plus 6t the be quiet dark Bass Pro 900 revision 2 is here with the modern IO for your Type C accessories and Qi charging gadgets the new hub is good for 8 fans and RGB strips plus the interior is incredibly modular for airflow water cooling invert systems and now with the power supply shroud check out the v2 down below well guys that's the oneplus 6t and honestly it's not a major upgrade over the oneplus 6 I'm pretty sure a lot of you guys saw this coming eventually but again at 549 I think it's priced competitively because it competes really well with the pixel 3 the pixel 3 Excel because I feel like it offers a little bit more features compared to those devices but none of the less what do you guys think about it what do you guys think about the price point and if you're an existing one plus 6 owner would you actually upgrade to the 16 or if you're coming from something like the oneplus 3 then oneplus 3T or even the oneplus 5 is it something or is oneplus 6t something that might be appealing towards you let me know in the comments down below I'm Eva with hundred connects thank you so much for watching and we'll see you in the next one",

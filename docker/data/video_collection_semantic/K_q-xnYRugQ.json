    "transcript": "A while ago I made a video on the US electrical system. It was a basic overview designed principally to get those of you in 240 lands to shu uh, to understand that we are also a 240 land, but since we use split-phase power most of our circuits operate at half that voltage and the full 240V potential is generally limited to high-power devices on dedicated circuits. Using split-phase power has some real advantages particularly when it comes to safety - and on that note at the end Im gonna add some clarifying words there because in the time since that video Ive discovered an interesting language quirk regarding that discussion. But anyway this video isnt gonna defend our electrical system. In fact, its about perhaps the worst part of it! And no, its not just our terrible, fully-metal plug design or completely unshielded receptacles. Although for what its worth, tamper-resistant receptacles are now available and usually required in new-construction. But anyway, this problem has actually nothing to do with a buildings wiring or the receptacles or plugs. Instead, its that these exist. And these. And especially these. Now theres nothing wrong with extension cords or power strips themselves, its just how theyre implemented which is the issue. Heres a silly fact to preview the problem at hand: A strand of Christmas lights is a safer extension cord than most extension cords. Yeah. Ill explain why in a bit, but first we need to address a common misconception. Circuit breakers! What are they for? Well, you might think that theyre there to protect you and your stuff. This belief is pretty understandable, after all one of the most common ways they get tripped is when one of your electrical stuffs has a bad time. And since they cut the power to a given circuit when they do their thing, well it stands to reason that they also help prevent electric shock. But a breaker like these does no such thing. It couldnt care less about your stuff, and quite frankly it doesnt care about you either. Of course, there is some nuance here with the advent of arc-fault circuit interrupters, and while we usually only put shock protection devices at the receptacle in locations where hands can be wet, breakers with integrated residual current devices (although we call them ground-fault circuit interrupters) are available. I actually made a video about that tech if you want to check it out. Its pretty interesting. But anyway, since AFCI breakers have only somewhat recently been mandated by code and GFCI breakers are, frankly, quite rare here youre going to find lots of electrical panels like this one, filled with nothing but bog-standard breakers. And these have one job and one job only. To protect the conductors in your walls. Thats it. They frankly do not care what happens when the electricity leaves the wall, they just want to know that youre not overloading the wiring coming out of them. They will stand idly by as you get zapped or as your television has a meltdown, and will only intervene once the current going through them exceeds their rating. Circuit breakers like these are overcurrent protection devices for a structures electrical system and nothing more. They reduce the risk of electrical fires occurring due to an overheating conductor igniting a wall stud or whatever, but thats about the only thing they can do. Now, that is very important! A given conductor (so, a wire) can only carry so much current before its own electrical resistance becomes significant and it begins to heat up. And thats. Bad. Imagine you had a coffee maker and a microwave and, why not, also a toaster all connected to the same circuit. This can be easier to accomplish than you might think, as many adjacent outlets are simply daisy-chained and share the same wires in the walls (though in fairness, kitchens are usually designed more smartly to avoid this). Now, on a 15 amp 120V circuit, 1,875 watts is the maximum that can be safely drawn. And in fact, that number is really only good for non-continuous loads. Devices which draw a load continuously are limited to 80% of a circuits capacity. Lets say the toaster uses 750 watts. And well imagine the coffee maker is 1,000. Making some toast while brewing coffee is really close to the limit, and if you decide to microwave some bacon while thats going on now you could easily be more than a kilowatt over. That is going to cause the wiring coming from the breaker panel up to wherever you are to get pretty hot, particularly where splices and other connections have been made. Because there tends to be flammable material in or near walls, this is very bad. And thats why these are here. They help prevent that. If you pull more power than the wires can safely carry, the breaker will trip and kill the circuit. How do circuit breakers work? Well, well save that for later. And then well get into the stuff like arc-fault protection and other goodies. Ill try to remember to come back here and put a card for that video but I have a bad track record, there. Anyway... Heres the problem. This will do a fantastic job of making sure the wiring in your walls doesnt get overloaded. But once youre outside of the wall, this wont help you. And since we like to cut costs wherever possible so we can sell cheap stuff, you will find countless extension cords and power strips which cannot safely handle the capacity of the circuits theyre plugged into. Lets talk about wire gauge. The amount of current a given conductor can carry safely depends on what it's made from as well as its total cross-sectional area. And also length. Theres some nuance with stranded vs. solid wire and with really weird stuff like the skin effect but were not going there. Now, Im going to be talking in the American Wire Gauge. I know, not everyone uses that. Heres a chart for those that want it. But the main point is that a given gauge of wire has a given maximum current it can carry before it becomes a problem. Now, crash course. The smaller the number, the thicker the wire. 14 gauge wire can carry less current than 12 gauge wire. 12 gauge is thicker than 14 gauge which is thicker than 16 gauge and so on. Its confusing, but are you really surprised? Except for circuits which handle things like water heaters, dryers, stoves, etc, youre generally going to have a mix of 15A and 20A circuits in an American home. It has become pretty common these days to run 20A circuits for most receptacles and reserve 15A for lighting circuits. But not always. Now it shouldnt surprise you that 20A circuits need thicker wires than 15A circuits. In runs with typical lengths, 15A circuits will use 14 gauge wire. And 20A circuits use 12 gauge wire. This is what that wiring looks like in homes all across the country, with some particular caveats. We dont need to get into that. Discuss in the comments. It boosts engagement. [THERE'S AN ERROR HERE - SEE PINNED COMMENT] Anyway, this is called THHN wiring, short for Thermoplastic High Heat-resistant Nylon-coated (cheaters) wire but often its just called Romex, which is to household wiring as Kleenex is to facial tissue. Conveniently, its been color-coded for many years now. 14 gauge wiring has white sheathing, and 12 gauge wiring has yellow sheathing. It helps you know at a glance which is which, and yellow wires will be for 20A circuits, white wires for 15. Oddly, there is also orange for 10 gauge wire, good for up to 30A depending on the length of the run, but then after that color coding goes out the window. [\"I dunno\" noise] Anyway, the circuit breakers? Theyre protecting this stuff. Theyre making sure you dont put too much current through these wires. But these wires are inside your walls. This one goes on the outside. And the problem is that this cannot handle the amount of current that the wires in the walls can, especially on 20A circuits. But your circuit breakers don't know that. Now this doesnt have to be a problem. One of the best features of the UKs electrical system is that the plugs have fuses in them. Now, the reason for that is kinda weird. Ring circuits. What were you thinking? But anyway the lasting benefit there is that you could provide overcurrent protection on the other side of the wall, allowing you to safely use smaller wiring thats sized according to the devices needs. If you put in a 7A fuse, well then that fuse will blow before the wire gets overloaded. Simple. Trouble is? We dont do that over here. This extension cord has 16 gauge wire in it, and its only rated for 1,625 watts, or 13 amps. And yet, it has nothing to stop you from exceeding that. Isnt that lovely? Even a 12 amp load, which is technically OK to put on this, makes the cord disconcertingly warm. But on any otherwise unloaded circuit, you can still pull at least another three amps through here without the breaker tripping. As far as it's concerned, well theres nothing wrong. 15 amps are on the wires in the walls, which is OK. But its not OK here. Keep a wire overloaded for too long and it will get very hot. And since flammable stuff may be around it, well that can easily start a fire. In fact, the wires insulation itself is often flammable, so if you let it get hot enough it will just spontaneously combust. Fun! Oh, and even relatively slight overloads can be a problem. If you have a long cord coiled up like this, the wire at the center of the bundle will get very warm thanks to the lack of airflow (and the fact that its surrounded by other warm bits of wire). This is a fire hazard that weve just decided is fine, I guess. And its not limited to these cheap cords. Go to a hardware store and youll find plenty of heavy-duty looking cords that are in fact only 16 gauge. They cannot safely supply the entire amount that the wiring in the walls can, which means it can be overloaded without your circuit breakers intervening. And this is just normal here. Youre just expected to know that this cord is only rated for 13 amps, and that if you really need 15 amps you gotta pony up for the 14 gauge cord. Its frankly bonkers. Oh, but its actually worse now that 20A circuits are so prevalent. Dont get me wrong, 20A circuits are largely a great thing. They allow for much greater flexibility in individual rooms, especially in the kitchen where nearly everything is a high-power device. But consider something like this power strip. This actually does use 14 gauge wiring and could be used safely on a 15 amp circuit. Its limit and the circuits limit are the same, so if youre overloading this thing youre also overloading the circuit so the breaker will intervene. Thats ideally how everything should work. But on a 20A circuit you can now severely overload this without the circuit breaker caring. And of course that problem still applies to a cord like this which can handle even less. The outlets in this room are on a 20A circuit. So I could plug a space heater into this. And also another one on medium. That is now 20 amps going through a cord which is only rated for 13. Its a very dangerous situation, especially if the cord is near anything flammable like, oh I dunno, curtains. Carpet. A sofa. Stuff that goes in houses. And yet were not overloading the circuit so as far as this guy is concerned its A-OK. Complicating things further is that you dont necessarily even know what circuits are 20 amps and which ones arent. This is a NEMA 5-15 receptacle. Its the normal one you find everywhere here. And this is a NEMA 5-20R receptacle. You will only find these on 20A circuits. The neutral pin is T-shaped to accommodate a NEMA 5-20 plug which looks like this. You basically never see this plug outside of commercial settings as its reserved for devices which actually need more than 15A to operate. But, you arent always required to use NEMA 5-20R receptacles on 20 amp circuits. In fact, if Im reading things right, you almost never have to. You can just use NEMA 5-15 so long as theres more than 1 individual plug on a circuit. Which, because duplex receptacles are the norm here, there pretty much always is. So anyway, you usually cant tell by looking at an outlet if its a 15 or 20A circuit, and we dont put protection on things like extension cords so really its just a mess. Its terrible. It is way too easy to create a dangerous situation with a power strip or extension cord. So, how do we manage with this terribleness? Fear. If theres one aspect of electrical safety that has successfully permeated through American culture, its that plugging things into other things is dangerous. Its practically a trope at this point. And frankly, this is almost too effective. When I revealed the details of this set I showed the cabinet of power strips that everythings plugged into and yall freaked out! Now Ive put this set on a power meter, and the entire thing uses 256 watts, barely more than 2 amps. The whole thing could easily be run through a cheap extension cord like this. This is not actually dangerous. But lots of people see this and cringe, which frankly is great. If we cant do things right on the infrastructure side, we can at least make people leery of doing stuff like this. And the National Electrical Code has some rules as far as how you need to build-out an electrical system. If youve ever been in a reasonably modern American home, youll probably have noticed that there are outlets. Everywhere. The purpose of this is to minimize the need for extension cords in the first place. Because the folks at the NEC recognize that these are bad. See, the theory is if theres an outlet within six feet of any point on a wall well you shouldnt need an extension cord since 6 feet is more or less the standard length of a power cord. But guys. I gotta ask. Have you considered, maybe, making extension cords less bad? This place follows those outlet-spacing guidelines but I still use extension cords. In fact the main reason I use them is because, well, they have three plugs on the end. Its nice to be able to plug in a lamp, phone charger, and another thing while leaving the other outlet free for a laptop or a vacuum cleaner or whatever. These arent going away, is the point. Theyre just too convenient. Really, we should have been copying the Brits this entire time. I mean, honestly, it can't be that difficult to design a plug that contains a fuse. In fact, weve already done that! These weedy little plugs in our Christmas lights contain fuses. Christmas lights are cost-cut to a ridiculous degree and have something absurd like 22 gauge wiring going through them so there needs to be a fuse since you can only safely pull, like, I dunno, 3 amps through here. Thats why I said Christmas lights are a safer extension cord than most extension cords. They actually have overcurrent protection. Granted, they dont work so well as extension cords since theyre usually not polarized but hey. The point remains. Frankly, if were gonna keep selling extension cords like this that cant even carry the minimum current of our smallest circuits, maybe we oughta put fuses in them. Ideally it would go here so it protects the length of the wire, but Ill settle for putting it in the other end if it makes things easier. Sure, if suddenly we were like extension cords need fuses now! that would be confusing (heh) and annoying to a lot of folks, but it would be a heckuva lot safer. And fuses are very, very cheap. It wouldnt add much cost to the cord set, and if people are using them correctly theyre unlikely to blow in the first place. And for what its worth, power strips arent always terrible. Lots of them - but certainly not all, to be clear - actually incorporate circuit breakers of their own. Ever notice that the switch says reset opposite of \"off\"? Thats because this toggle is actually a small circuit breaker and not just a simple switch. Look. I plug two space heaters into this and it trips. Now, lots of people will say never plug a space heater into a power strip and honestly thats not terrible advice. A lot of these are made quite cheaply and they do get kinda melty sometimes. But the effort is at least often made. Now heres where I step back and ask, how bad is this really? How many house fires are started due to an overloaded cord or power strip? In fact, I dont think we know! It looks like it might not be that many. According to a 2019 report by the National Fire Protection Association, only about 10% of fires can be blamed on electrical distribution and lighting equipment, of which only 11% can be blamed on cords or plugs, and further of that subset only 12% could be blamed on overloaded equipment. So, were talking 12% of 11% of 10%. Or about a tenth of a percent of all fires. However, I personally take issue with this particular study because electrical failure and malfunction is really, really, vague. And that category gets a huge proportion of all the known fires which makes me think it may not mean a whole lot. Now, I dont know anything about fire investigation so dont take my word for this. But I do have to say that I feel this category is being used as a catch-all and I dont know what exactly it can tell us. The report even says 50% of these fires are of unclassified cause so, frankly, I dont know how useful this study is for this particular discussion. And in fairness, I get it. Investigating the cause of a fire is tricky when everything was on fire at one point. This whole electrical failure, malfunction category also finds its way into this FEMA study where it accounts for 88% of electrical fires! ...what? Again. Im gonna stress that I am a person on the internet with a Google. This is speculation and conjecture, nothing more. But this study also says that in almost 31% of electrical fires, electrical wire or cable insulation was the first thing ignited. Annoyingly, though, that could mean cable in the walls, or lamp cords. Who knows. However we do see up here that only 8.7% of electrical fires start in a wall cavity or concealed space, which, if my grasp of math is at all intact, means the majority of cable and wire-related fires occur outside the wall. Which frankly makes sense because thats beyond what a circuit breaker is designed to manage. The only conclusion I feel comfortable making here is that I dont have enough information to come to a meaningful conclusion. I dont think this isnt a problem, especially since 20A circuits are so common these days, but in all likelihood its probably still a small one. People are well-trained to be leery of overloading stuff, for the most part. As it is, electrical problems are by no means the leading cause of house fires, accounting for only 13% in the US. But I do think its telling that the NEC is making us put outlets everywhere so that we dont need to - or shouldnt need to - use extension cords. It seems we know that theyre dangerous but are addressing that danger in what I would call an insufficient way. I understand the impulse to eliminate the need for extension cords which would in theory nip the problem in the bud. But as I said, extension cords are often used not because theres no outlet within reach, but because its a cheap and convenient splitter. I think the problem at hand is imagined incorrectly, so the solution doesnt fit. I would say we should consider addressing the danger of the thing itself, and not try to reduce the need for the thing. We could mitigate much of the danger quite easily with a ten cent fuse in the plug. Our electrical safety isnt exactly great. I dont think its awful by any means and it does continue to get better year over year, but we could do with an examination of all these items. If youre smart about how you use extension cords, you really dont need to worry. But it still makes me uncomfortable how were OK with stepping the wire gauge down twice once it leaves the wall and not doing anything to prevent overloading it. And frankly, this isnt even limited to extension cords. As far as Im concerned everything should be protected by a user-replaceable fuse sized for its cord set and purpose. You know. Reasonable precaution. What a concept! Anyway, for now, just be smart with extension cords and power strips. Be sure to use one thats appropriate for whatever you need to do with it. And to be clear, I use these cheap ones all the time, its not like I have anything against them or consider them terrifyingly dangerous Its just theres a component of risk to their use that I feel should be more widely known and, hopefully one day, addressed. To close out, heres that language quirk I mentioned in the beginning. It has to do with the word safer. See, heres what I said in that original video. In any given scenario where one is receiving an electric shock, a lower voltage is safer than a higher one when all other factors are the same. Therefore, 120V could (and I would say should) be considered safer than 240V. Now, heres where things get wonky. I use the word safer synonymously with less dangerous. Just as how I think extension cords would be safer if they had fuses. But that doesnt necessarily mean that they would be 100% safe. But I found that a lot of people interpret the word safer as implying some amount of baseline safety. I found out because people told me! And the thing is, thats just not at all how that word functions for me! I use it literally as a stand-in for less dangerous. Or perhaps \"less risky.\" Like how driving 100 miles an hour with your headlights on is safer than driving the same speed in the dark. That statement doesnt suggest to me that driving 100 miles an hour is a safe activity. Its just safer than doing 100 by moonlight. To me safer is always a comparator alone, and doesnt bring its own implication of any safety. So yeah. I actually was genuinely delighted to hear this explanation because I was starting to lose my mind thinking Ohms law was a trick or something. And I am absolutely in agreement that the shock-mitigation efforts in 240V countries are by and large much better than ours. Its stupidly easy to get a shock here. Seriously. Just hold a plug wrong and youll get a tingle. So Im not saying that our electrical system is safer than your electrical system. Because its undeniably not. But I am saying that, because the voltage is lower, electric shocks are less likely to be fatal over here. And thats why our efforts to prevent them are half-assed. The voltage itself is safer, as in less dangerous. The electrical system as a whole though sure isnt. Anyway, toodles! overloadedly smooth jazz It couldnt care less about you and your.. Shoot! Circuit breakers like these are over- [thud] Well, that wasnt nice. ...igniting a wall stud or whatever, but thats a blpppt. Would you please stop doing that? This is a NEMA 5-20R receptacle, and Im holding it upside down. You can tell that I start every shoot with everything I need. Right? I dont think its awful by any means, and it does continue to de get de be de de de de bu debba du And especially these. And I only got the one. Oh well. Hi. It's the end. As in, the part where the video stops. Now you can watch something else. Maybe click on the little (i) doohickey and see the other videos of mine that I referenced? Just a suggestion.",

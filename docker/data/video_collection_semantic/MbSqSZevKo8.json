    "transcript": "- I am going to blow up this power supply. With the tester behind me. In fact, if all goes according to plan I'm gonna be blowing up a lot of power supplies. That's right. It's time for another lab update. And this time we have got the goods. I'm talking finished metal 3D prints, machine vision automated game benchmarking, and a special room to host my own legally dubious 5G network. Why would I spend all this money and risk prison time you ask? For science! Now the clever among you probably noticed that this was the first big piece of equipment we purchased and it's taken us a pretty long time to get it running. What's the deal with that? Well there's a couple reasons. First, we needed an adequate power hookup. Then we needed an appropriate oscilloscope. Actually, we still need an oscilloscope. We'll get to that in a moment. Finally, we needed someone as knowledgeable about electronics as he is tall. That's where this guy comes in. Because I mean who knows what would happen if I came over here and twisted this dial. Or pushed this button. Or... Wait, what does this one do? - [\"Automated\" Voice] (buzzes) Segue. Sponsor - The Ridge! Oh, upgrade your everyday carry with the Ridge wallet. Its RFID blocking technology protects your cards from digital theft while its durable materials ensure it lasts for years to come. Even once the apocalypse starts. Click the link below and use code LINUS to save 10% off your purchase and get free shipping. - And we're back. What you're looking at is every harness coming off of the power supply connected through these WAGOs to our power supply tester. Now the reason that we can't just twist them together for our testing is that we also need Vsense wires that are also running back to our power supply tester so that we can see what voltages those rails are actually running at. Because, spoiler alert, 3.3, 5, 12. Yeah, in your dreams, Premier. More like 12.34. Actually the five volt's really close. 3.3's a little low. These are all well within spec though. But we aren't drawing any power from it yet. Let's see what happens when we change that sitch. I guess we are drawing a little bit. Like, I don't know, 40 watts or 50 watts or something like that. Give me 150 watts! Wait, 150 on the five volt rail? Are you mad? Wait. Oh, this is a really old power supply. 22 amps on the five volt rail. - [Adam] What are you - are you just holding that? - Should I be touching this? - [Adam] No, yeah, probably not. - [Tall Man] Oh, it just shut off. - It shut off? - [Tall Man] Yeah. Like that was it? It's gone already? But I only asked for 150 watts! Well hey, that means the overcurrent protection worked though. We tried to draw 150 watts on a rail that's only rated for... 110. And it was like no. Okay, so you got 50 watts on the 12 volt rail. Okay, how about a hundred watts? Oh my god, it's off again. Okay, we're at 65 watts. - [Adam] I think it's just dead. - I can't believe you've done this. You know, this was a very sentimental power supply for me. I've had it since before you were born. You can tell by looking at it. I've seen comments questioning if we need such a fancy tester. And the truth is, guys if all we want is to test basic overcurrent protection circuits or to see if it just immediately fails when we try to draw power from it, the answer is no. But we don't want to stop at complete garbage and \"Well, seem safe enough. Good luck.\" We want to put real pressure on manufacturers. And in order to do that, we needed to close the gap between the professional gear that's used to design these products, and the hobbyist level equipment that many tech media outlets have been stuck with. So in order to do that we got some help from reputable manufacturers. Seasonic helped us spec this unit to begin with and Johnny from Corsair, AKA the one and only Johnny Guru, gave us some tips on how to best use it. We've also recently just completed our onsite training from Chroma. And every component in this stack plays an important role. Starting at the bottom where you'll find our AC power supply. That's this guy right here. This can not only supply an ample amount of power, but it can also simulate a variety of distortions which will allow us to test a power supply's behavior during non-ideal conditions. Such as during a brownout. This feeds into our \"big switch\" as we call it which I've just been informed is completely redundant. The AC source can also turn the power on and off, so why we need an on/off controller I don't know. And that... Okay. Then we have our DC supply which is used to supply additional DC power to our over voltage protection/short circuit testing device. Above the desk then we've got the jack in panel. This allows us to plug AC power into our power supply and then also plug our power supply into all the diagnostic equipment here. Including our timing and noise analyzer as well as our programmable loads. These can be adjusted to simulate any kind of device you want. Though obviously we are most interested in creating loads that will behave like a PC. Why do we need so many of them you might ask? Well each of these can pull about 400 watts. So say we wanted to test a 1500 watt power supply. A 2000 watt power supply. We would need a lot more than one of them. It's also really helpful for testing multi-rail designs. Now a really cool aspect of programmable loads is that they can simulate the behavior of real components. Like the big transient spikes that made the 3090ti so famous. Finally at the top we've got our multimeter and power meter which give us all sorts of information about our circuit and would plug into our oscilloscope. If I had one! Seriously, it's in the mail already, and the first video we're planning is a budget power supply roundup. Does anyone actually make a sub $40 power supply you can trust? Speaking of trust. The telecommunications industry, am I right? We're gonna get it there. Behind me is our new EMC chamber. Electronics go in. (dramatic sting) No electromagnetic radiation gets in or out. That means we can put what whatever we want in here and cut it off completely from the outside world. We can test wifi, we can test 5G, we can test Bluetooth. Within this chamber we could simulate a noisy environment. Or we could simulate a distant access point which can tell us not just how fast and reliable a connection can be, or what bands a device supports, but even how battery life might be affected by having to crank the transmit power due to crummy reception. Now you might be thinking whoa, slow down there, turbo. How are you gonna test 5G in an impenetrable box? Well with my own cell phone network of course. If I had one! Thanks to the CRTC and similar regulatory bodies, you have to get permission to use the parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that are reserved for cell phone service. And that permission is expensive. Canadian Teleco spent a collective 3.5 billion for licenses to the 600 megahertz band. That's just one band. I can't do that. So instead, we're gonna be purchasing a Firecell lab kit. We're gonna go into way more detail in a future video, but here's the quick and dirty version. If you're a big company, big like Apple or BMW, you would likely get corporate and regulatory approval to run your tests using an actual cell. Like the antenna on a cell tower. These are very expensive though, full of corporate secrets, and frankly overkill for our purposes anyway. The Firecell on the other hand is one of, if not the only off-the-shelf testing units. And it allows us to test 4G, 5G, and after an incoming update, even millimeter wave. And because the government can't detect our network as long as it stays in this box, I am very unlikely to get arrested for broadcasting unreserved frequencies. In fact, no one can even hear you scream. Watch this. (screams) (muffled screaming) I couldn't help noticing the Firecell stuff is not here. - That's right. So it's arriving on June 6th. It's, you know, an early birthday present for my wife. (group laughs) - And dog house. - No, it arrives on June 6th. - Okay. - We're going to have it positioned here on a desk. We're actually gonna have to get some floor cutouts done so we can spread some of the weight. We don't want the table punching through the styrofoam here, right? - Right, 'cause these foam things, you didn't see these in the construction video. These are the negative of the carbon impregnated foam here. And it allows us to just walk on it. I guess they have no function RF wise? - Very very minimal reflection. - Got it. - And they can hold enough weight. Callanan was in here with me. No problem. - Wow, you're gonna call him out like that? - He called himself out first. - [Adam] His nickname is Nick Heavy. He gave it to himself. - Yeah. - Yeah, okay. But you'll have to explain to me what's the usefulness of testing a 4G network from like four meters away. That's not realistic. - Well effectively what we can do is we can control the power levels that we're broadcasting at to simulate different distances. The way that these chambers work, and with the frequency bands we're testing, we need to be able to have the broadcast equipment a certain distance from the wall and a certain distance from the device under test. That's why I've got this kind of C shape here. So we can get over here. This is where the broadcast equipment will be. And then over there we're gonna have a pedestal with the device under test. - How do we simulate things like obstructions? Because those exist in the real world. - One of the cool things with that is we actually have a fair bit of leftover foam. Including some of the flat, lossy absorber. So we can position that in between the device that's broadcasting and the device under test. We can also bring in other larger pieces. Wood framing walls, a sheet of drywall if we wanted to, to see how that actually impacts things. And I can tell you on millimeter wave, if you have even a pane of glass in between you and the broadcast antenna, you'll lose connection. - We go into a lot more depth about the actual construction of the chamber In another video. We're gonna have that linked in the description. And if you want to hear even more about it, Jake Daynes from the lab recorded a deeper dive that's gonna be coming soon at Floatplane.com/LTT. Coming back to the outside world. Well, as outside as we get these days, let's take a look at our benchmarking situation. It's never been a problem to script performance testing for games that include canned benchmarks. And some of you helpfully pointed that out when I talked about how cool MarkBench was gonna be because we could automate all this stuff. But what's not that easy is running pre-done repeatable benchmarks for games that don't include canned benchmarks. Well guess what? We can do that now. And I would love to interview the team that has been working on it, but Nick's on vacation, Jesse's shy, and these two are on probation, so Tim will be helping us. Behind us we've got three separate benches running through our graphics testing suite right now, but the keen-eyed among you will have noticed that there's a fourth monitor that's doing something called OCR or optical character recognition. Why do we need that when we could just run an AutoHotkey script? - Yeah, yeah, totally. Autohotkey scripts are dumb and we don't want to use those because if they run into problems, they have no way to solve them. - Right. - And so the way that we're moving forward with developing the harnesses for the games that we want to test is making sure that they're flexible, they're reliable, and if a new screen pops up because of a new season update, or something that we haven't yet caught is just kind of buggy, we want to be able to click on those things reliably and repeatably. - Got it. So okay, that just changed. Why are we looking at that monster? - Yeah, what you can see is there are some green boxes around various pieces of text that it sees. Every screen that it shows there is a \"failure\" to find what it's looking for. It's looking for a specific set of characters or a specific word to click on its next action. And each screen that we're looking at is not finding it yet. - This is pretty cool. (laughs) - Theoretically it's scalable too. We're running three right now, but we can connect a whole bunch more. - And Adam said that we weren't gonna talk about this, but I decided it's really cool and we are gonna talk about it. What Jesse's been working on mostly is taking this entire dump of recorded footage and chopping out all the crap we don't need. So we don't see any menus or any junk like that. It's just all benchmark runs. Which is gonna be super cool when we're editing them down for you guys to see side by side gameplay. - Yeah. That's the bulk of our work when we're trying to get through an embargo or a review of something and we're trying to make sure that that doesn't need to be done anymore. - Sick. I noticed something else that's really cool. - [Tim] Yeah! - This keyboard says recording on it right now. And my understanding is that it's red for a reason. - Yeah. So we are working on RGB, but we've got R right now. The reason that we have R is because we actually found that alt tabbing in some games was causing performance issues. We were not getting repeatable results by switching to MarkBench, starting recording, switching back to the game. And we needed a way to know is that recording running rather than having it on the screen which was also a performance impact. - So once RGB is working, you said we're gonna have a progress indicator meaning that these keyboards are basically acting as glorified LED strips and recording lamps. - Thanks, SteelSeries. - Ah, a wild Tynan appears! We have completed our first test print on our metal 3D printer. And naturally, we chose. (gasps) A scale replica of the LTT screwdriver handle. Now we can't show you guys the inside of the oven, NDA and all of that noise, but we can talk a little bit about our experience with the Rapidia metal 3D printer. I see you did an end cap as well. I see it's in a completely different finish. What are we even looking at right now? - I printed both of these and did vastly different post processes on these after it came out of our furnace. Rapidia generally suggests sanding it before it even goes in. - Really? - Because sanding steel is a lot harder than sanding essentially clay. - Wait, that's what it starts with? - Yeah, so. - Shut up! That is so cool. Okay, just a second here. So this is what you put in. And this came out? - Yeah. - It's so much bigger. - There's about a 16% shrink rate for the parts after they come out. - 16? - [Tynan] 1-6. - You mean 60. That looks so much bigger. That's a 16% difference? - Yep. - Interesting. - When it's in three dimensions it looks a lot bigger than it is. - So wait, what, so this is just a support thing then? Oh my God, look, it's totally 3D printed supports. And the steel is just embedded in the clay? - Yeah, so it's part of it. And I use the term clay, it's not really clay. It's steel and a binding material. But it just, it's a very similar texture to like a clay pot before it's fired. At this. - Wow. - So for a bit of reference, this is a support piece that I printed for something else. - Uh-huh. - Break that - Easy. - Pretty much like it's nothing. - Okay. Now where's a metal printed support piece? Okay, now you want me to break this. - You can try. Don't do that! (laughs) - I noticed that you haven't actually assembled this into a screwdriver. I assume because it's difficult to press fit a shaft into... Did you think of that before you started, Tynan? - Yes. - And since we're not actually making a metal screwdriver, at least to my knowledge, what is the point of this project? - Doing this project is building knowledge within the team of how to use this equipment. So when we need to use it for either a video or for prototyping merch items, we have the expertise and don't need to rush to try to build the expertise when we want to shoot a video in a week. - Got it. Now tell me something. Is there a structural disadvantage to this? Like can I just. Like is it just a hunk of stainless steel or is it like other 3D printed plastic objects where the structural integrity of it is inferior to a cast piece? - It is a little bit inferior in terms of like overall mechanical properties. But for anything we're gonna do. - Yeah. - It's essentially solid steel. - Not a scratch. Can we even show like- - Yeah, we can show this. - Oh we can show this? - Yeah, we can show this. - Oh cool! Okay! You're printing key caps 'cause of course you are. - Yeah. I have one. They're fun. (Linus laughs) So this is what it actually comes off the printer as. We have two nozzles. One that does the metal paste and one that does a support. So for all of these pieces, the actual part you want is separated from the base by an aluminum material which is essentially a ceramic. Otherwise it's gonna bond together and you are not getting it apart. - Right. - To get this thing off of its support, and it had proper separation, I still had to whack it with a hammer a whole bunch of times. - Sick. Are we doing a metal screw jacket? - Maybe. - Oh yeah, and in all the excitement I almost forgot to update you guys. We've officially moved in. I've got procurement over here on my right. I've got logistics over here on my left. They're very proud of their new cable ties that are color-coded for different cable lengths. (employee laughs) No, It's a good thing. (bell rings) Is that a bell? Was that a bell? - [Employee] That's the doorbell. - That's the doorbell? That is an awful doorbell. Also, it is getting awfully hot in here. We actually booked air conditioning for this warehouse a year ago and we are still waiting for air conditioning units, so it's gonna get a little stuffy over the next little bit here. RAM storage. Now that's a creative use of server rack shelves. Eh? Eh? My intention was to introduce you guys to our community manager and talk to the social team here, but I guess they're all on lunch, so cool. I'm sure glad we delayed this shoot from after hours yesterday to today so that everyone would be here. Anyway, the point is they only just moved in. Why? Because of this! The server room that is next door to them. It was so freakin' loud in that room that we had to add sound treatment to all of the walls and ceiling of this room just to make sure that it would be quiet enough so you could hear yourself think over there. Unfortunately, even after we added our three layer solution of SONOpan, Rockwool and Duvetyne, it was still loud. And it turned out there was some annoying buzz from one of the transformers that's directly above them. I bet Jake that we would actually have to replace that transformer. He bet that we could just use some isolation pads under it and long story short, I owe Jake two lunches. It's pretty good in there. Old Trafford here. This is where you'll find the Mac address folks And Jake Bellavance is usually here. Our Short Circuit channel lead. See, this is what I'm talking about! We're trying to show a building full of people we moved in with and... - [Sam] You want me to- - No no no, you're good! You're good, Sam! Go, go, lunch, lunch. The writer's area is fully moved into. Jake and James haven't taken over that office that I'm sure inevitably they will take over at some point. Emily's desk, Tanner. Jordan, what are you working on? What the hell is this? - I'm working on these guys. - Not this, that. What is that? - That's not working right now. What the heck? Adam and Plouffe who you know. Yeah, I know where my office is. It's still very not set up. As it turns out, I have more important things to do than arrange things in my office. Go figure. - [Jake] That's why you have an assistant, right? - Well I mean yeah, I have an assistant, but it turns out he has more important things to do than arrange things in my office. Where the hell is everybody? Well. Brandon Dickerson's space is here. He's set up this like neutral gray over everything so that he can do display testing. I was told that these two scopes cost the same as like a decent car. They're for color. I'm sure Brandon's gonna have a big update for you guys once he's got his proper space set up out in the warehouse, but at least this is getting us some data in the meantime and he can work on his testing methodology. - Here, look at this. - What is this? - I got a secret for you. - Is this PoE powered? - What do you think it is? - I think it's security cameras. - This is a security camera? What? - No, I think it's gonna be security cameras. - Ehh! - It's LTT Store. Okay, what is this thing? What is the point of it? Ubiquity makes a display now. - [Jake] It's like a PoE-powered touchscreen. - [Linus] Oh, okay. For what? - I don't know. You can show the cameras but you can upload any Android app. I was thinking for LTX this would be like a really dope way for people to be able to just like pre-browse stuff. - Oh. I know for some of you that must feel like not enough progress. Like what's going on? This is taking forever to get labs going, but. The reality is we're taking the time that we need to do it right. I mean think about it. App/roaming data wasn't built in a day. That's some computer humor for you. And I'm gonna follow it up with this segue to our sponsor. - Vessi! Looking for a new pair of kicks to wear during the summer? Pick up a pair of Vessis! But hey Riley, aren't Vessi only good as \"rain shoes\" which is a previously existing phrase apparently? Nope! Vessi's Dyma-tex technology is designed to keep their shoes kicking it animal style rain or shine. I don't know what I'm saying. Check out the boardwalk slip on sneakers. With a classic design fit for summer, they're also made to let sweat and heat escape keeping your feet dry. Oh, and on that note, of course Vessi also claims their shoes are 100% waterproof. An EVA midsole cushions your feet without added weight for unmatched comfort during prolonged use. These puppies are ready for the beach! Check out the Vessi Boardwalk and other styles at vessi.com/linustechtips and use code LTT for 15% off your entire order. - If you guys enjoyed this video, why don't you check out the one where we shoved a computer into an environmental chamber to see how much we could overclock it?

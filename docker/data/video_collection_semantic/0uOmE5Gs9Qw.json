    "transcript": "- Welcome back to another ShortCircuit chair unboxing today, we're talking about Razer's new ENKI chair, which they're releasing to join the ranks of the Iskur that they have people that are watching this video. You're probably wondering why another chair? Why are they doing another chair? Well, this one is kind of designed for everybody in mind, right? This is supposed to be a chair that you can sit in all day and still be comfortable. So that's kind of the market that they're targeting. Also, they have two variants of this chair, the ENKI and the ENKI X and the ENKI X is actually going to be, I believe $299. Where as the ENKI is $399. I always love these warning labels. I need to surf the chair who do that, do not touch the back rest recline lever while installing or moving the backrest. Glad we're reading the instructions here, is this for us or just for everybody that gets these chairs, builders, gauntlets. I got the builders, gauntlets, everybody protect your Razer gear today. Get a peace of mind with the Razer protection plan. So this chair comes with a three-year warranty and the instructions are right here. This is already looking a lot different than the Iskur. Even at this point bottom, I feels so cool with these gloves man, Memory foam, head, rest pillow. This was shaped a little differently. That's a bunch of accessories. I mean, one thing about doing all of these chairs, short circuit videos is I'm starting to get like really good at building chairs. This is where the instructions just go out the window. I'm just gonna open it up here. Oh, boy is that Razer stickers talks about the three-year warranty. I can't open it with these gauntlets. I will say what the accessories I do like the way that they've kind of laid everything out, like everything's right in front of you as far as I can tell, which is cool. So like a lot of chairs, they've got a 60 millimeter PU casters for the bottom of your chair. Do I take the gloves off? I feel like I can't take the gloves off, but it's so hard to open the plastic and... lastly, but not lastly. Well, that's actually hunker, I like it. We're going to start by attaching the base to the backrest of the chair. It's exciting stuff. This is content. So these screws are just, pre-installed just need to take them out and actually put them on and we'll be good to go. This is where I'm, I'm taking the gloves off. I can't take the gloves off. Let me get a little bit of a water from my, favorite lttstore.com water bottle. user error. What have I done? I think I cross riddled a screw, I'm trying to do all of the screws at once. Bad idea. I take back everything I said about me being good at building chairs. I do like the included tool, pretty standard practice though. There's a lot of chairs that come with these kinds of tools. Now it's time to put on these covers, super easy, slot that in and put the screw in and you just put the little cover on it and you're good. Now we're going to install the base screws are all pre-IND screws. So he's going to take them out, do not touch the mechanism when tilting I'm glad, they have that there to reiterate that, Hey, there it is. It's a, Razer's got instructions. This goes towards the front. That's awesome. Honestly is probably a better way I could do this, but I'm just gonna use my foot to brace it. Make sure all the screws are snug. So the whole chair itself is a steel frame construction. And then I believe this is an aluminum base and we're just going to put the casters on. Hello. Look, I don't know if these things are just difficult to install or if I'm just weak, David, - [David] There you go, are you expecting to go deeper than that? - I don't - [David] Is that not in? - I don't know. who to thought the casters would cause us trouble. You just put them in at this point. We're just going to put all the wheels in about the same spot and just hope for the best. All right. That feels about right. That feels good to me. Pretty straight forward. Bada Bing, bada boom. Very standard on these types of chairs. Booyah! That's a chair. Now the chairs built. All we got to do is just sit in it and take it for a ride right after a word from our sponsor. Jackery. Thanks to Jackery for sponsoring today's short circuit there explore 1500 portable power station has enough juice to keep all your devices powered and connected. It's huge 1500 watt hour capacity and 1800 watt output rate allows for up to seven devices plugged in simultaneously and it only takes four hours to recharge from zero up to 80%. Check out the Explorer, 1500, the link below and use code Linus tech tips to get 10% off. I have one last thing I need to do before we sit in this chair, Brand it, the sticker, actually, this is almost like it was intended. Razer if you want to hire me to be a designer, I could apply. Take it for a ride here. Whope! Oh yeah. Not bad. There's a few cool things about this chair that I'd like to point out right now. Now that I'm sitting in it first off is that it has a wider seat base than it does for the back here. And as you can tell, it has this kind of sloped arch at your shoulder height or what would be your shoulder height. If you're a little bit taller than me, there we go. Or if I sat straight, the idea behind this kind of arch and the wider seat base is it's supposed to kind of centralize your waist. So just even your weight distribution across the entire chair. Another interesting thing that you can't see on camera, but I'm feeling right now is that the back is definitely pretty stiff, but that's good because I feel like my back is actually being held and properly supported while the base is actually relatively comfy. Like it's cushy. You can even see that the basis thicker because they put more kind of cushion and padding on the base to support you. I weigh about 157 pounds. Razer says this chair supportive for people up to 300 pounds. And who knows if in the future, they'll do what they did with the Iskur and kind of release a separate variant for different frames and different uh weights. Let me do the good old Caster test, hold on I'm gonna start over here. Not bad. Not the best I've ever seen, but this chair also costs, you know, less than $500. So one of the biggest differences between the ENKI and the Iskur from the moment that I first saw this chair is the lumbar support system. If you remember, the Iskur had a really unique way of dealing with adjusting lumbar and turning knob stuff to just the kind of different feel on your back. But this is all built in, which I assume is probably for cost savings, but it's respectable. And it does well for a chair of this price point. So I think I mentioned earlier that there is going to be the ENKI and the ENKI X Differences between those two are that the ENKI X does not come with this head pillow, the ENKI X also doesn't have four dimensional arm, rest adjustability, like the regular ENKI that we have here does. And the last big difference between the ENKI and the ENKI X is the system for which it handles recline. So the ENKI here has your 152 degree tilt has a frog system, which.. like a frog, you know, while the ENKI X has a traditional butterfly system. Another notable thing about these chairs, they come in different colors. So they come in green, quarts and black, I believe. I mean, as a Razer gaming chair designed for everyday comfort. So we need to game in the thing. So we're actually going to bring a few people on to do that. We're bringing Geoff to the table here and that's because Geoff bought the Razer Iskur chair that we un-boxed before, take this one for a ride, get to get it adjusted, get it dialed in, play some a Counter-Strike, good old Counter-Strike. - [Geoff] Can you adjust the lumbar? Is there a lumbar in it? - There is lumbar in it and there's no adjusting it, - [Geoff] that's it? - That's it. How does this thing feel? How's your back? How's like your, your posture. How do you feel? - [Geoff] It feels good. - It feels almost exactly the same as how I usually have the Razer Iskur set up at home. It's not like too, too pressed up against my lower spine. The neck feels kind of nice though. - You like the neck pillow. - [Geoff] I like it more. It's actually bigger than a lot of neck pillows, which is interesting. - [Geoff] I think I appreciate that, I think I appreciate it. - I didn't actually think about that before with the different shape of the head pillow and the way that it sits. I mean, it kind of rests on the top of your back, which I could see actually being kind of nice rather than just having this like giant thing jamming into the back of your head. How does the base feel? How do you feel sitting on it? Does it feel pretty comfy? - [Geoff] I feel it feels sort of the same. Maybe its a little stiffer on this guy here. - The idea behind the Razer Iskur is the back is actually supposed to be a little bit more stiff where the base actually has more cushion. It's supposed to kind of just more evenly distribute your weight, but coming from the Iskur like, yeah, it's gonna be tough to tell these things, especially when you almost sat on it for like five seconds. - [Geoff] It's not bad. - Yeah.. Cool. Whoa, bud. I thought you were going to fall for a second. David. You're next, bud? - [David] Oh this is... What do you think? - [David] It's not ugly. I would definitely get rid of that, Oh but then it's ugly under here, no it looks so cheap! - whoa. This is supposed to, - [David] I like- this is supposed to provide better back support. Okay. - [David] I think that looks good. The quilted stuff looks good. - This chair retails for $399 and there's another variant. That's pretty similar. That's $299. - [David] That's not bad! - What do you have a home? What do you sit on a home. - [David] I have a MayoChair, I have like a really cheap ergo chair. The adjustability is okay for a chair this cheap. I like, I like being able to go back, especially when I'm playing more chill games. I can kind of do this. - Then kind of lounge. - [David] Yeah like have my feet up. The cushion is kind of not super there. So if you want like a cushy chair, this isn't great. I'm actually really impressed at how much control you have over the placement of the armrest. For a cheap chair, this is actually pretty cool. It's an okay chair... I wouldn't buy it. But it's not bad, But I wouldn't buy a gaming chair. I would buy an ergo chair anyway. - Fair. I'll yeah gimme that, gimme that. Look. Some people, some people like that, that's it for the Razer ENKI, you know, this chair for his price category. If you're looking at other chairs included, I don't think it's anything super fantastic. The Iskur was so exciting because it was the first chair from Razer had its custom lumbar support system. But I honestly think Razer's going to sell more of this chair anyway. So yeah, if you're interested, check it out. The link below, you can learn more about it. Thank you all very much for watching. Make sure to get subscribed to short circuit comment down below what other chairs you'd like to see and we'll, we'll see on the next one. Bye-bye.",

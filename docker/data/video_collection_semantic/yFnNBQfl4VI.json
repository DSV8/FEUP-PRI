    "transcript": "have you ever dreamed of having two screens on a laptop I'm sure I did back in the day when I had conversations with my high school friends we came up with some interesting designs that had two displays we jam-packed it with some high in specs faster CPU GPU and memory available at the time I don't even know where those sketches are right now we probably ended up throwing that out but anyways we're slowly starting to see that dream turned into reality with a lot of these dual screen notebooks entering into the market and it has been generating some mixed reactions within the community some say that it is amazing I can do so many things with that second screen I'm gonna be a pro activity champ creators can take advantage for that little display whereas others think that it is a gimmick why add a second screen on notebook it adds heat to the system it's probably gonna affect battery life and performance and potentially it also results in notebook designs that don't look like laptops anymore so in front of me is HP's omen x 2s it's a really powerful gaming laptop features Intel's Core i7 19 CPU six innings of RAM a terabyte of PCIe SSD 144 Hertz g-sync display and RT X 28 Emacs cute this thing is absolutely specked out but above all of that HP has implemented a second display that allows gamers streamers or anyone who can take advantage of that second screen the flexibility to run multiple apps at the same time the starting price of the 2's is a little over 1,800 US dollars and for that you get a smaller SSD and an rtX 2070 max-q GPU the spec that I have over here it cost around $2,400 but you can spend nearly 4 grand to spec this thing out but instead of making this a typical notebook review I'm gonna be focusing on that second screen how does it actually benefit a gamer considering that this is a gaming laptop does it affect performance battery life does it also affect filmer issues as well basically what is it like using a notebook with two screens well allow me to walk you through my experience but first a quick message from our sponsor the sound blaster a 9 is a special kind of treat for audio enthusiasts with their best emi shielding yet a fantastic DAC and swappable op amps plus a well-designed break box that includes an XLR input your ears deserve the best and perhaps your motherboard needs a friend check it out below alright so what you're looking at is a six inch 1080p 60 Hertz display with touch support when you boot up the notebook HP scum and Center takes over the screen automatically where it allows the user to monitor system resources you can also switch between different performance modes like comfort default and dynamic power performance which was the mode that was used to run the benchmarks this changes the behavior of the CPU and GPU then you can customize the RGB lighting of the system but oddly enough it won't let you customize the keyboard until you open command center on the primary display so keep that in mind the next tab lets you screen mirror a particular portion of your gameplay and I'll get to that in just a moment the last tab offers a few more settings for the screen including the ability to enable or disable touch support for the screen while you're in a game play now this is a standalone display which means you can bring in any program you like to the second screen and start working off of it the downside is that it is a glossy display which means it's extremely difficult to view content outdoors and the view angles are pretty terrible I wouldn't recommend watching videos on the screen there is a weird magenta shift when you look at it from a normal position and contrast is just way off but if you stare at it directly overhead it's fine except you'd look ridiculous that way HP has built a few keys right above the numpad that allows you to turn off the display although do keep in mind that it doesn't disconnect itself from the GPU Windows still sees it as a second screen you also have the ability to adjust the brightness of the display and an interesting feature that lets you switch apps instantly between the main display and the secondary display so for instance if you're working off of the main display and you have a video playing in the background on the second screen and you're constantly really exciting in the video that you want to bring into your main display as quick as possible that button is supposed to switch the video to this main screen and then what's on the main screen to the second screen except it barely worked on my sample sometimes I ended up getting glitches on the video on the main display that just looked weird in other cases it just didn't work it was a little bit frustrating to see this feature not work especially since it is very applicable if I or other you know casual apps and also do keep in mind that if you have a game running in the main display and if you want to switch that it's just not gonna work moving on to actual use case scenarios well to be honest I have mixed feelings about using the second display let's start off with the basic stuff like bringing in your file explorer while working on something else on the main screen it could be useful if you want to quickly access things but I have some difficulty weeding the text because the screen is just way too small what's really cool is that as soon as you drag the window from the main display to the second screen it automatically snaps into full-screen mode although keep in mind that it does not work with every application so that's something to keep note of I think one of my favorite use case is browsing through my spotify playlist the app does a pretty good job with scaling and it's fairly intuitive to navigate around with if you're into discord the screen works pretty well with the app you can coordinate with your fellow teammates by talking to them while playing and it doesn't interrupt your gameplay that's running on your main screen which is really cool if you're into streaming and if you use OBS this is a great way to monitor your stream on the second screen while focusing on your main task I think this would come in super handy for streamers on the go I should also mention that you're only allowed to run one application at a time on this display you can't split screens although that would look worse in the first place then there is the real time screen mirroring feature that allows you to snip a portion of your gameplay and magnify it onto the second screen it sounds like it's pretty straightforward but it isn't because there are some things that you have to keep in mind before trying this out first every game that you run should be on borderless windowed mode because it is a secondary display after all and you need to be able to move the cursor from top to bottom secondly you have to define the specific area before the gameplay starts because once you're in the snipping feature won't work and you can't change it in real time so you have to hit escape assign the area and get back in now does the screen mirroring feature make you a better gamer not really because I take advantage of it I mean a few use cases that you could take advantage of is probably bringing in your maps or your health status or potentially if you want to magnify your shooting target to target your enemy that is one use case scenario but realistically speaking guys it is something that you're running on a flat display that's literally on a horizontal service and you're kind of supposed to focus on what's on the main display and if you just lose your focus for just a second and look in your second screen someone might just snipe you within that second so you just lose that momentum that you've been building up so far so it's it's a cool concept but I don't think it would significantly or it would help you become a better gamer that's just that's just my take now I did try running some creative applications like Adobe Premiere but guys I hate to say this again but the screen is just way too small to accommodate the timeline and the scaling is pretty terrible it's very difficult to read text when you're viewing at a normal distance I tried bringing in other panelists like the Lummi tree scopes and lumetri color but unfortunately it's just difficult to read the text on top of the glossy screen plus the not-so-great viewing angles make it an unviable solution I also experienced some courts with the second screen so when I'm having a video playing in the background on this display and have something on my main display whether if it's you know running a game or perhaps in resolve or something like that the video actually starts stuttering which really wasn't pleasing to the eye also the screen just stopped responding to me sometimes it just just wouldn't work if I'm trying to bring a window from my main display to the second display it just it's completely disabled it gets disconnected from the GPU which means I had to get it fixed with a restart so that was a bit annoying like I said the hardware still needs refinements and most importantly software is something that HP certainly has to take a look into so does the second display benefit me in any shape or form I personally can't bring it into my workflow but I think that this could be a great solution for streamers on the go with all of that out of the way let's quickly talk about the design of this laptop well it is a gaming laptop after all HP has stuck with their omen mantra for a while now and they haven't really done anything different here the front panel has an interesting choice of textures I'm glad that it is in brushed aluminum the omen logo is backlit and RGB and you can customize that through the command center the build quality of the 2S is really good it's actually a little bit on the heavier side coming in at over 5 pounds so even though that it might look like a Finn gaming laptop it isn't necessarily light it's certainly heavier than my razor blade 15 opening up the notebook you're greeted with the keyboard and trackpad shift it's at the bottom this is of course to do to that second screen the keys have a good amount of travel distance and it's tactile it's much better than my razor blade 15 I'd say it's on par to the arrow 15X from gigabytes so that's a good thing it's also RGB backlit and customizable through command center the trackpad is shifted to the right hand side and to be honest with you it's easier to get used to but I feel like it's a bit too small again this is because I'm used to track pads that are larger on the positive side the surface is really smooth for navigation it is one of the best track pants that I've used on a notebook thanks to precision drivers plus you also get dedicated left and right buttons and with the help of pressing this button it brings up a virtual numpad on the second screen port selection is decent on the left hand side there's power in HDMI 2.0 2 USB 3.1 gen2 a ports in such n2 that's a big red flag guys I mean this laptop cost over $2,400 and you're getting IO that's not up to spec so basically you won't have access to the 10 gigabits per second protocol with Gen 2 because you're stuck with five gigabits per second with Gen 1 as for the rest of the ports there's Gigabit Ethernet headphone and mic jack on the right hand side there's an extra 3.1 gen one port and a Thunderbolt 3 port that also functions as DP 1.4 the display on the 2's is great it's a 1080p 144 Hertz IPS screen with g-sync I had an absolute blast gaming on and color reproduction is really good and I didn't notice any packwood bleed with my naked eye so that's nice in terms of upgrade ability when you open up this laptop you have instant access to the memory modules which are populated you also have an additional m2 slot for expandable 'ti so that's nice this notebook comes with a 72 watt hour battery unfortunately battery life is not great and I expected this because it's got high inspects a 140 for her to G Singh display and on top of that you also have a second screen running off of that graphics card so with my light load test I got roughly over two and a half hours and on a heavy load tests maybe close to two hours but interestingly enough I decided to run these tests with the second display turned on and that also significantly brings down the battery life so certainly not the best and something to definitely keep note of the i7 9750 h6 scored 12 thread CPU performs like a champ the clock speeds were hitting 4.4 gigahertz on all six course and it is the fastest notebook sleepier than i've seen as you can see with the Cinebench r15 r20 and blender tests it takes the lead compared to the Allegiant Wi-Fi 45 featuring that same CPU moving on to my Adobe premier benchmark unfortunately it did not do well the system took over 20 minutes to render our 13 minute 4k project and I expected this because it's running a decent display and you HD Graphics is disabled and the user does not have the option to disable G Singh to enable you H to graphics like what you were able to do with the Y 740 from Lenovo so yeah when it comes to Adobe Premiere the rendering performance is not that great however if you plan on editing with DaVinci Resolve the studio version to be exact this thing is gonna fly because you've got that RT X 28 Emacs q2 to take advantage of gaming on the other hand was as expected fantastic you can easily push over a hundred frames per second in pretty much every triple-a title like battlefield one overwatch and apex legends far cry 5 and Shadow the to mirror also did really well but I thought to myself since this laptop comes with a second display does it actually impact gaming performance well it certainly does but nothing significant to a point where it's unplayable I ran a 4k video on that screen and ran these benchmarks taking a look at temperatures and things are not looking good guys you see when I was briefed on this notebook HP mentioned that they used liquid metal from thermal grizzly on the CPU and GPU and it was really excited about that until I put it to the test as you can see the CPU gets to a whopping 97 see and guys this is just when rendering a video using Adobe Premiere that's disappointing and really odd considering liquid metal supposed to bring down those temps significantly interestingly enough I didn't notice the clock speeds throttle while running these tests so it looks like the CPU was being pushed to its limits but that application seemed to work really well with the GPU the max temp I saw in the r-tx 20 max queue was 68 C and that's damn good for a GP of that caliber and the clock speeds on the GPU were hitting about 1600 megahertz so that's up to spec I should also mention that that secondary display adds heat to the system so as you can see by these thermal shots back and forth there is a significant difference between the two when the display is turned off and turned on with a game running in the background fan noise is respectable under gaming scenarios it doesn't sound like a jet fan which is nice but during idle scenarios you can still hear the fans ramp up I'm just gonna stay silent for a second so you guys can listen for yourselves so hopefully that gave you a rough idea there is unfortunately no way to control the fan RPMs through command center I still feel like the software is a little bit limiting in that area so hopefully HP could update that in the future oh and for those of you wondering about performance differences between comfort default and dynamic power performance well here are the numbers on my cinnamon jar 15 run yes there is a difference so it really depends on what you want to do at an instant so I guess this brings us to the conclusion and guys I know it's been a long one but I hope I was able to answer a lot of the questions that you guys might have had with this laptop but let's kick things off with that second display it's a cool implementation I got give HP the credit for implementing and thinking out of the box in terms of implementing one in a gaming notebook but it still has a lot of work to be done first and foremost it's glossy it's small the text is very difficult to read especially on a normal viewing distance and I wish HP was able to extend the display all the way to the left and the right so you get a little bit more virtual screen real estate the battery life is also pretty terrible on this notebook but that is to be expected considering the specs and it just isn't your typical gaming laptop that you can lug around with it's more of a temporary plug-and-play solution and that's obviously due to the trackpad and the keyboard shifted towards the bottom so you also lose the lap ability which is certainly something to consider especially if you plan on taking this to say university or your work place things there are a lot of factors to consider before pulling the trigger on this laptop not to mention it starts at $1,800 and for that you get an RT X 2070 max Q and a 1440 hurts juicing display and I'm glad that they aren't charging a boatload of cash for that second screen but my biggest issue with this laptop are those CP temperatures they just run way too hot especially on a regular workload like rendering a video and Adobe Premiere it just doesn't make any sense they say that they have applied liquid metal on the CPU but I just can't see that working that well especially on this notebook on the other hand it does cool that our TX 28 max Q really well I mean 60 Hz under full load that's that's just amazing so with all of that being said I want to know your thoughts about the Omen X 2S gaming laptop what do you guys think about it I wonder thoughts about this second display is it something that you can take advantage of if you're a streamer who's watching this video I want to know her thoughts about that second screen do you see yourself taking manage of it especially if you're on the go again chiming in the comments down below I'm here with hybrid connects

    "transcript": "today I'm gonna destroy some AMD graphics cards using portal RTX or by its internal code name the graphics card spit roaster 9000 but first ha nothing quite brings families together on Christmas like a good old Linux based cloud computing and web hosting service like today's video sponsor Le node the node offers many powerful linuxy products from cloud compute to storage database management and networking they even have bot management products imagine if somebody told Elon Musk about lenode and could have saved them a whole bunch of money that joke's a bit late but whatever if the note sounds good to you use the link in my video description to get a 60 day hundred dollar free credit thank you lenod for sponsoring today's video [Music] thank you oh I am very excited as you can see we've got portal with the added spit roasting now one quick note I'm starting off with an RTX 3080 TI one of the most powerful graphics cards I have just to get a bit of a performance bass line before we drop the AMD gpus in and I'm having to use fraps as a performance overlay because it's the only one that's worked so far and settings wise I'm going to be using 1080p because apparently even that's vicious oh it kind of looks like portal although we do not have very many frames happening here let's quickly check the ray tracing settings I think it's alt X oh it is all very high although it says the dlss 3 is on which is a bit weird considering that um this isn't a 40 series GPU wow when you turn it off the frame rate really tanks damn do we drop it to high that helps that helps a little denoising quality enhancing assets we don't want motion blur on now in terms of settings I am gonna leave dlss 3.0 off because well the AMD GPU is probably not going to be able to use that we will we will put it on intermittently and see what it does but this is kind of the settings that we're using oh look at that the button is like a translucent plastic or gloss I'm assuming and it it looks it looks transparent very well that's cool it like fades in the red glow fancy so this is a very basic room running natively at 1080p and this this 3080 TI is getting curbs stomped a little bit I'm quickly going to turn s back on to see how much of a difference that makes now we've got over a hundred frames per second and honestly it is difficult to tell the difference between it on and off like maybe it's a little bit more fuzzy on on the corners but wow this is actually a really good dlss implementation it feels good it looks fine now from what I've been able to tell this is a very Advanced Ray tracing implementation oof on that note when the door opened you can tell that it takes the game a moment to figure out what's going on because there's like you can see the denoising phase in that kind of ruins the illusion a little bit but that's that's fine and in here you can see that there's clearly a very competent window cleaner working at aperture laboratory because these windows are spotless look at that the frame rate is chugging real hard I'm excited to see what's gonna happen with it with the AMD gpus yeah I mean with that let's throw in the first one and see what happens to it now the slowest AMD victim we're gonna be using today is the RX 6600 which should be interesting considering that at Native 1080p the 3080 TI kind of got handled by portals so let's see what happens for some reason when I drop the AMD GPU into the system all the performance overlays even fraps stopped working which means unfortunately we are gonna have to rely on the steam FPS overlay which keeps flashing in and out of the top corner and it is very tiny but at the moment it says that it's running at 3 FPS in the menu that's a very good start wow okay I thought for a moment there it crashed but it is just running unbelievably poorly it says two frames per second but I I don't think that's accurate I think it's actually I think it's actually running worse than that this is some pretty Esty or terrible performance we have here if you like move the mouse it like basically doesn't respond to what you're doing okay let's have a look at what settings it's trying to run at it just defaulted to ultra which I think is very brave oh this is going to be very difficult to select things and after spending quite a while wrestling the menus I was able to set it down from Ultra to high preset yes that hasn't helped at all in terms of frame rate after that I rage quit and decided to just edit the settings in the INF file which also didn't make much of a difference ah yes at the lowest settings with 1080p we got a big performance jump we've got a whole three frames per second now uh let me let me try drop the resolution and see what that does now the next step is to just lower the resolution you know old school dlss without the upscaling I guess compared to one frame per second seven is just Lightning Fast look at that ghosting behind the toilet I then switched to the lowest 16x9 resolution solution in the game unfortunately we couldn't quite break the 10 frame per second barrier despite being below 720p with the RX 6600 but I did actually think of a way we can get much better performance so let's give that a try before we drop a beat for your graphics card in here a few moments later wow suddenly we have 300 frames per second and this is a 1080p look at that it's running so beautifully um this is a bit of a stupid joke I just realized let's let's drop a bigger graphics card in there [Music] you can tell just by the physical size difference between the two cards the 6700 XT is a slightly beefier graphics card than the 6600 so let's see how it fares with portal spit roast we almost briefly got 10 frames per second there and I think all the settings has uh no it's not all reset it's all still on the lowest it'll go okay um never mind I was briefly pretty excited there because I thought that everything defaulted back to ultra settings but it it kept the same settings as before although it is giving us a slightly higher frame rate at 1080p than we were getting at below 720p with the RX 6600 Whoa We briefly got oh 17 frames per second holy crap this graphics card is a complete monster see it still does the pretty lighting thing on the Companion Cube it just does so quite blurrily and at at 15 frames per second but it is working I then dropped the resolution to 720p there we go at 720p it's running a lot better although look at all that smearing this kind of looks like fiery sewer runoff threw up on an average standard portal without all of the ray tracing effects actually looks quite a bit better than this yeah I actually think on that note we go to the biggest AMD boy that I have lying around the RX 6950 XT wow that Behemoth actually makes the 6700 XT look small which is quite the feat so a graphics card that not very long ago cost over a thousand dollars just gets its teeth kicked in by this game at 1080p but at least we can kind of walk around and look at things like here in this room we're sitting at 22 frames per second however this next room is real bad I'm guessing that clean windows are like the path tracing raid boss because we're getting below 10 frames per second again here the thing is even the RTX 3080 TI which itself not very long ago cost over a thousand dollars and is from the same company that made the tool used to convert to this game still gets handled by portal at 1080p at least without dlss on so I think portal RTX rightly earned its title as the graphics card spit roaster 9000 and until the next video thank you for watching bye [Music] thank you",

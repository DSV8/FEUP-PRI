    "transcript": "- Hello and welcome to this is, Are You a Super Alpha Man's Man of a Man Boy? - Yeah. Yes. - Then this website is for you. The website we're talking about is called Uncrate. It calls itself the leading buyers guide for men. Austin and I are banned from doing this because we are not men, we are boys. Let's do the first item that should not exist but is sold on Uncrate - Whoop. Huupe. - So you all remember the smart basketball from our dumb products that Apple sold? Well, here is the accompanying smart poop that would- - Huupe. - Try and make that sound every time you hoop. - Say one more time. Huupe. This basketball backboard would you call it a lot a backboard? - I'd say just a basket. - So are you trying to aim for her face? Is that what you're doing? - It's a normal backboard. Okay. It just happens to have a screen in it which will do things as magical and wonderful as count your baskets. - The basket will tell you how many baskets. It's like swish. - Almost like the one that we got from Costco for like a hundred dollars that's been downstairs in our break room for the last three months. - Now the cool thing about this one is it costs $4,000. I'm too poor to even have like just me going on this website over drafted my bank account. - I as someone who has been scammed a time or two in my day would never ever judge you dear viewer Sam for making questionable decisions. However, he got four grand to drop on this thing. He's okay. You've probably still got plenty of Ethereum to cover your mortgage this month. - If Charles Barkley doesn't get on here and coach me, this ain't worth it because I just wanted Charles Barkley to come on just like, that. Shot was terrible. That was terrible. The Null Stern Zero real estate. - Can we just take a moment? Can we just appreciate this image? Okay, cool. I'm done. Appreciating what the fu- I'm calling the police. I'm saying to this gas station in Switzerland where you're gonna be sitting there with your buns out in the middle of the wilderness rather than a place of rest this aims to keep you awake and offers a place of reflection on current affairs such as the climate, the economy, security or quality. - Is that because the homeless guy that sits out in front of the gas station is just gonna be screaming about how the government stole his fingernails or something? - Okay, couple of thoughts here. First of all, what happens when it rains? Second of all, it does come with a- - It keeps you awake - Butler. It comes with a butler. Does the Butler work inside the gas station? Where is the butler? - Does he, is it just a guy who pumps your gas? - I could not agree with Matt more and that this is actually a neat idea if you're like on top of a mountain. Yeah, like that's like some, like - If you're like overviewing a waterfall and like whatever. - Imagine this like on top of like a skyscraper or something in a big city. Yeah, that'd be cool. Yeah. This is beta. As the kids say. Unlike some of these questionable items this video is sponsored by Narwal and their brand new Narwal Freo Robotic Mop and Vacuum. - The Freo has every situation covered with five different modes, including vacuum, mop, both and Freo. You don't even have to swap between the modular as they do not interfere with each other. - Plus maintenance is super easy. The Freo knows when to return the mop home for self cleaning and self drying and it's really easy to change out that base station's tray. You can also do just about anything you want from the base station's, LCD display or from the app. - The brand new Freo mode cleans smarter. It detects dirt levels and floor types and even adjusts and repeats accordingly. - And it gets those hard edges and corners easily. Thanks to Narwal's patented smart swing sick, twisty action. Smart, swing, sick, twisty action. I got it right because it plots its routes with optimal overlap for maximum coverage and efficiency. - It is super quiet, which is perfect when you have a little anxiety ridden dog like I do. - Is it Nibbler approved? - It is Nibbler approved. - To learn more about Narwal Freo, check out the link of the description and of course, huge shout out to Narwal for sponsoring this portion of the video. - That what the, the shoes. Have you ever looked at your favorite hype B sneaker and thought, What if this was a gun? - My brain is locking up because I have so many questions. First of all, what kind of weaponry is this? Does this shoot bullets, Nerf bullets, darts? Beebees? - It shoots the little plastic things that are on the end of shoelaces. - Why do we need to put guns and shoes together? - This is America baby. - I feel like I'm getting the idea of what Uncrate's about and I'm quickly learning that it is not our demographic. - It is very clear where Elon Musk gets all of his stuff from, Oh yeah - No, no. The Dyson Air purifying headphones. So this is a set of headphones that will cancel everything, right? If you're a fan of being canceled wear these headphones because they will cancel you. Also, those headphones look really ugly. Can I You say - How dare you? Because the Dyson engineers spent six years and had over 500 prototypes. This is the, this is the winner. They went as far as to create a mannequin with working mechanical lungs to test this out. - And again, this is the best they had. - All right. - Oh. A Patek Philippe. - Oh wait. Oh God. - Is that a Patek Philippe? A Patek Philippe? - So this here, you are not buying. - Wait, what? The particularly not to, I can't read. - The Nautilus. - You're only buying an NFT of this watch. You're buying shares of a watch that some other dude owns. - Is it like a timeshare for watches? - No - A timeshare. - Get out, get out. Get out! (laughter) for a fraction of the price and not even a small fraction because just based on this website, you can be like I own one one-thousandth of George Clooney's Patek Philippe watch. - Matt, would this make you feel better? Did they announce this and then it just never happened? But wait - What? What? - The All Design Lab Hitekw Tennis Racket. - This is where Skynet comes in. This is the moment that - Does look like it's about to terminate. Terminate me. - This sci-fi design is the result of the AI program. DALL-E, this bad boy unfortunately will never be used by Roger Feder because he is - He's what man? - Retired - From a game? - No, from tennis. - Oh, the DeLorean Omega. Okay. So here's the thing. DeLorean not to be confused with the DeLorean Motor company which was famously run out of business by a certain scandal with cocaine and whatnot back in the eighties. of course the original DeLorean only made the one car. But now that they have begun bringing things back it makes sense that they're trying to drum up a whole lot of interest. Now, apparently the new DeLorean, the guy who bought the existing trademark and has rebuilt the DeLorean, they've actually been sued. - Are you so alpha that you're living in the future? Well, us betas are living in the present which might as well be middle aged past. DeLorean's were just not well made. - Well you know what? Sometimes you don't need to be well made. - This is literally made by alpha. - It is eighty miles an hour. You can see some serious sh- the Prodrive Callum Racing Simulator. - Do you wish you could drive the DeLorean from 2040 but you live in today now? Also, do you wanna do the other rich person sport which is Formula One? - Absolutely. - This is only slightly cheaper than just buying your own Formula One car - As a Formula One aficionado. I feel very accomplished and qualified to tell you that this looks dope. 16 layers of steam bent birch. You've got a Cobra Nagarro racing seat. It's a carbon fiber cockpit with the sim cube pro steering motor. But at least it does say that assembly is included, so they'll come to your house and build you this dope as- racing setup. - I mean, you know a lot about this. It's almost like you have like a F1 podcast. - Look, I'm gonna actually be really honest with you for a second. $47,000 is a lot money, right? A lot of money. But - You're about to justify this and - It's not crazy - When we say eat the rich, I'm talking about you. - I'm not gonna buy one of these things. But - If I, if I show up to your house and I see this here I hope this comes with pre-filled out divorce papers because - Is this a screenshot from Cyber Punk? - Sometimes you wanna wear a hat and sometimes you wanna wear sunglasses. But how do you do it at the same time? The sunglasses - And then the hat's on top of it. And then like you can't break into the bank because they can see your forehead. It's very unfortunately robbing. - It's only time someone came up with a solution. Well, luckily Fendi did for a mere $700. You too can look like an idiot - If you wear this in public and get punched in the face. I think you just gotta chalk it up to part of the deal. Woo. More driving shoes. These are the Aurelien Driving Shoes. Are you so rich that you need to change into your Italian driving shoes whenever you go for a drive? Kenzie wrote that for me because I actually have driving shoes and I wear them sometimes when I go to the track or for go carts or something. - I Hate you so much - But does it make you feel better that while they are driving shoes I got them for $25 at like some clearance rack - That's $25 more than you should have spent on driving shoes. - They're they're, they're Ferrari form fit. Puma shoes and what I say form fit. - Form fit to what? - My foot. - You bought them off the rack. - They're just really small shoes. So I'm- - Just because you have tiny feet. - If you're really watching this, Sam I need your help right now. Let these guys know that I am not off base and the driving shoes while not necessary when you're going fast the last thing I do is press the wrong pedal. Would you spend $200 on like cleats? - Cleats that dig into the grass where you're running - This digs into the pedals so you don't trip over your feet. I'm telling you. - I've never, I've never stepped on like my gas pedal and been like, Man, I wish I had, I wish I had cleats on this. I'm so rich that I can't, I need to have multiple pedals. I'm so poor that I asked. - That's not the same thing. We need to move on immediately or I'm get really upset here. Oh, this is a different engine. What engine, fuel the dream, but in gin. - Wait. Wait. I'm like, wait, this, this this one here has been a roller coaster. This is Italian gin. And organic, which I mean of course it is. It's gin. - Well it's Italian so it's like it's going for the whole like motor sport theme. You know it looks like an oil can. - What you're really paying for here is that the website has a fully interactive 3D experience. - Would you guys like to see this? - I would love - You're paying for the dev. - Oh my goodness. Is that the Gin station? - Oh my god. - Oh we're going inside. We're going inside. Actually you know what? This branding is kind of neat. I'm not gonna lie. This is - This is right now taking up about 12% of AWS just in the processing power for this website. Do you want a big well kept island? Well this isn't the listing for you. Instead you can get a Little Ragged Island. It's 712 acres that complete with exotic fish. You know water. - 712 acres. That's small - For an island? You live on like a quarter of an acre. - Okay. Fair enough. Exotic fish, fresh springs and lignum vitae trees. - Lig-num balls. (upbeat music) - Ladies and gentlemen. - Love so much.... - We got them. - Having fresh springs on your island actually is probably a pretty big deal. - Yes, because you know when you are stranded on island - You gotta drink. - Yeah, you gotta drink. So Tom Hanks owns the auction of Sooth Bees. - Sotheby's. - Sotheby's - What you've never heard of Sotheby's. - What? - You've never heard of Sotheby's. - No - They're one of the big auction. - I'm poor! - Okay, nevermind. - eBay is the only option I know. - Fair enough, fair enough. Continue. Hey, are there laws If you have you own Island can you do whatever you want? - Well it depends on where it is and you can learn more about that if you go and watch one of our greatest This is episodes - I was about to ask - on Sea Land. I mean this is exactly how Bond villains start. So - Heron, Preston and ZellerFeld have combined to create one of the most Sigma products of all time. Do you like sneakers, Matt? - No. - Do you like 3D printing? - No. - What if you could 3D print sneakers? - I don't want to. - Well, too bad because now the Heron01 is here. You can now be a beta tester for 3D print. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I don't wanna be beta testing anything. If I'm on this website, I better be alpha testing this. - Basically if you join, you install an iPhone app, upload your pictures directly to Wiki fee I mean to their 3D printing services where they will then charge you $350 and 3D print sneakers that are perfectly designed for your feet. - Wow. That's very impressive. - What we do is you grab, - yep, grab your foot. - Grab your iPhone. There you go. Bam. Send that off. Okay, now fun fact, we actually had had this 3D model from Austin's foot originally. - How dare you, how dare you - The Garden Glory Hose. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa - You're thinking of a different, you're thinking no. Oh - No, no. Absolutely not young man. Absolutely not. I look at it in Sophisticated Now garden hoses. - Dull green eye sores have received a Scandinavian inspired update. $170 is too much for a garden hose. Do you want your neighbors to think that you just went to Home Depot and bought a peasant hose? Ha hilarious, Garden Glory, which is apparently a company only provides the finest of Accoutrement and other various chotskis and high end paraphernalia. - Why am I still holding the foot? - You know what Matt? That's a great question. Why are you still holding your finger over the subscribe button and your other middle finger over the Ringling Dingling button? I'm not sure why, but you gotta do it both at the same time. Thank you very much for subscribing. We appreciate your support as this garden glory for your $170. - Do you ever wish your nice new shoes look like you went through a mud compactor - The Balenciaga trash can, high tops - Fallon Ki-aga? - Balenciaga - Valenciaga? So this is the limited edition which comes aged with decades worth of wear. There are only 100 pairs in existence and they're a cool $1,820. - Great news for me is, cause I'm pretty sure I have a pair of these sitting back at my parents' house. So there goes my my kids' college fund. - Well do it make you feel better that you could also spend $495 for their slightly thrashed high tops. This is a real art piece, right? Because it shows that while idiots have money they can easily have that money stolen from them by companies such as Balenciaga who - My favorite art about this is that some guy is gonna buy these and then never wear them because he is worried about ruining them. - I'm poor. - Moving on. - Well, you know what you need, Matt, If you're poor let me tell you this. You can easily finance a few kidneys for the Airyacht Airship Yacht. Don't you hate it when you get on your mega yacht that hundred 97 foot beauty that's floating in the Mediterranean Sea soaking up that beautiful French sunrise. Well, let me tell you what you can't fly in that beach, can you? Well look no further because this is a 656 foot blimp that will fly your boat around. This apparently does come with the yacht. However, the yacht does not have any self-propelling or motors. So good luck with that. Also, good luck with getting yours because while they're currently taking orders they're expecting to deliver in 2026. - So we live in Los Angeles where we see - Yeah capital of the world. - Below. Dumb. Yeah, I cannot wait to just watch one of these float by. Cause like as the world descends into awfulness you just float away above the clouds. I think I'm gonna get one of these. I think if I sell my old Converse, I think I can swing this. - What, one, up horror picture from Director T West. - They'll do like curated like boxes of everyday carries. Let's say like as an alpha, I wanna look good but I don't maybe have the alpha design yet. - You need some inspiration perhaps? - You need some inspiration. Or better yet, have some beta peasant do it for me. So they have these boxes here. It'll be something like, Here's this watch and it goes great with this pen that costs $20,000. And also this taser knife that is another $4,500. - Wait, wait, is there actually basketball? - Yeah, this one is a ball and outfit. It comes with a $300 basketball. - Is this compatible with the Huupe? - Think about it. This is a bargain. You can get this entire fit for what? Two grand, three grand. - If you buy me this, I'll wear it. - Thank you very much for watching this episode of This Is make sure to subscribe Ringling that dingaling button with both fingers of course. out some swear words on his pants, we will see you then. Matt, can you play us out please? - No.",

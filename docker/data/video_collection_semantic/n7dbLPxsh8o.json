    "transcript": "- Hey guys, how's it going? It's Justine, that's me, welcome to Ask iJ. Hashtag AskiJ. iJ, short for iJustine, for those who might not have gathered that over the past eight years that I've been doing this show. Welcome to the first episode of Ask iJ. Let's get that first question out of the way. What's your favorite animal? Panda bears. Everybody's got a question on their mind On their mind So now it's time So now it's time Before we get into the questions I wanted to show you guys this commercial that I did for Wix. I know you guys have seen a bunch of other YouTubers do these commercials. You may have already seen them running as prerolls on my video. Well this is gonna be an ad inception, because there's probably a pretty good chance that this ad has run before this video that you actually watch. But some of you have YouTube Red, so you may have never even actually seen this yet. I had so much fun working on this so I wanted to show it to you guys. You've been tweeting me pictures of it. I'm so glad that you guys have enjoyed it. You can check it out at ijustine.com. But first, let me show you the commercial 'cause I love how it turned out and I'm also so excited because my dear sweet baby Mattie made a cameo on set. Hey guys, how's it going? Today I wanna show you my awesome new Wix website. It's got everything I love all in one place. (Maddie barking) Oh of course that means you too, Mattie. Let me show you guys how I did it. I'm gonna get started by choosing one of these amazing templates. Let's just drag it right over here, nice. So I make videos and I have hundreds of them online, which is why I'm pretty excited about this new video gallery of mine. Everything's synced up to my YouTube channel, so you can watch them all right here. Let's change the text up a bit. (light rock music) Now I wanna add some photos. They'll all appear in amazing high resolution which is super important because everything has to look professional. Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, check, perfection. Everything's gotta look great on my phone. (phones ringing) Phones. Okay, are you ready for the big reveal? Tada, I love it, what do you guys think? (rock music) Go to wix.com and create your stunning website today. So one of the things that was kinda fun is I did get to bring my dog to set and it was insane because I was like, okay, Mattie is coming in, he's ready to perform, can everybody make sure that all of the doors are closed to the outside? There was a door that was left open. Sorry, we forgot there's a door that was left open back here. Mattie's outside. Okay, we're heading to set now with our little prince. Oh, hold on a second. Mattie's coming in. (crowd cheering) If we could like close that door also is that possible? - [Man] Hold the dog please. - So I can let him go? Come on Mattie. Say hello to everybody. - [Woman] That's her dog-- - [Woman] Oh the door's open back here. - Mattie, come here honey, you want a treat? So I scooped him up, brought him back inside and then he performed and here he is in the commercial. Now wait. Here, good boy, great honey. Sit, wait. Wait. Wait, good boy, good wait Mattie, good wait. So if you guys wanna get your own website check out wix.com. I'll put a link in the description and also if you guys wanna check out my new website go to ijustine.com. I've actually been getting notifications of anytime anybody signs up on my site, so it's kind of cool because I basically am seeing real time as you guys are accessing the site. So the reason that you guys are all here because this is an Ask iJ episode. And judging by the title we're talking about the HomePod because that's basically all you guys were asking me. I'm like searching through the Ask iJ hashtag, I was like HomePod, HomePod, HomePod, HomePod, HomePod, HomePod, HomePod. Okay, you guys wanna know if I'm gonna buy the HomePod and yeah, of course. Who do you think I am? I live and breathe for new tech, especially when it is in the realm of my sweet, sweet Apple. So the HomePod'll be available in two different colors. They are 349. It comes in the white and the gray. It's gonna be really interesting to see how Siri and the HomePod fits into this whole ecosystem because it's already been so built out by all of these other companies. We've got Samsung with Bixby, we've got Amazon with Alexa, we've got Google with their Google Home, we've got Windows with Cortana. And if you're a Mac user, obviously Siri is a huge part of our daily lives whether you like it or not. Sometimes I accidentally hit that freaking Siri button on my Macbook and I'm like, no, it was an accident. But yet I don't want to turn her off because I sometimes actually do use it. So it's a fine line that I've gotta walk with my girl. But Apple seems to be coming into this very, very late. Because I would be very interested to see people who are super tech savvy that don't already have one of these things integrated into their life in some way, whether it's through their TVs or just the device themselves. And that doesn't even take into account how many people have Sonos systems in their house. But now Sonos has Alexa integrated into it. But now at launch the HomePod isn't going to have all of its capabilities available. Will people buy the HomePod immediately or will they wait until the software update actually allows all of the functionality that the HomePod should be having at launch? Then will they get it after the update is out? But that is one of the good things is yes, you have this piece of technology, but with a simple software update you can expand what it currently is shipping with. I wanted to say to infinity and beyond, but honestly that is, I couldn't say it better. I mean, that's really what it is. I mean the only limitations are really the hardware itself. So in a long-winded sort of rambling answer, yes, I'm getting a HomePod. At launch I think I'll only be getting one until they unlock the feature where you can use it in multiple rooms. The functionality isn't 100% there yet. But as I said, that's a software update, so that will be something in the future. Realistically what I'm thinking that I'll do is I will put one in my office and one downstairs in my kitchen right next to my Amazon Alexa, mostly because I use the Alexa Show. And what I love about the Alex Show is it has a big screen on it. So every day I walk downstairs, I glance at Alexa, I see what the latest news is, and then I ask her some questions like what's the weather? Can you read me my news. - [Alexa] Here's your flash briefing. - No, I wasn't actually asking you for it. - [Alexa] From NPR news (laughing covers voice). The New York Times just reported that President Trump-- - I'm not, I didn't, was I actually, I wasn't even talking to her right now. - [Alexa] He changed his mind when the White House-- - Alexa, stop. I completely forgot that I have two Alexa-enabled devices up here. I have the GE Soul Lite which is powered by A, and I recently got one of the A Spots. Did I even answer a question? I don't even know, I'm not sure. I'm sure some of you guys are gonna ask, have I been using my massive MOFI? Yeah, I have been, and this thing's amazing. I've been using it to charge my drones on the go, I use it to charge my laptop, and now I'm just charging my phone with it. Yes, it's massive and very heavy. I need to plan accordingly if this is coming with me. Nick wants to know why Adobe Premiere is the best editing software in the world forever. And he's trolling me. He is 100% trolling me because he knows I love Final Cut. Nick has been shooting a bunch of videos for me lately and he knows that this is a lie, and I've been trying to get him on Final Cut for a very long time and it's gonna happen. I think I should do a video about it, and actually that would be very funny to see us going side by side, him trying to edit a video in Final Cut, me trying to edit one in Premiere. But to be fair, I did start editing videos in Premiere even before I started on Final Cut. But this was a very long time ago. That was back in college. So a lot of things have changed since then Stewen wants to know what is the most favorite video that I've made during my 11 years of being on YouTube. And actually this is kinda crazy because my favorite video that I ever made was a stop motion video that I did in partnership with Google. They were like what kind of video would you like to make, if you could make anything what would you wanna do for the holidays? I was like this is what I wanna make. (intense upbeat music) Noah wants to know if I can tell you about the movie that I worked on in Pittsburgh. I don't even know if I can tell you guys. I should probably ask. I shot a whole vlog about it, which I haven't posted yet obviously either. But it was really fun movie and I had so much fun being able to be home and shooting a film in my hometown. So hopefully you guys will get to see that soon. Melissa says what do you suggest if somebody wants to do YouTube but is scared because they think everybody will make fun of them. Here's the truth, you're gonna get made fun of. You're probably gonna get made fun of a lot. And there's absolutely nothing you can do about it. You're gonna get made fun of in real life, you're gonna get made fun of online, but you also have to take into account that there are people who are going to absolutely adore you. They are gonna love the things that you're gonna do, but you're also gonna have the people that disagree. That's just life, like there's nothing that you can do about it. And once you realize that, I'll tell you what, life gets a lot easier. You're able to brush things off way easier 'cause you're like, okay cool, you're gonna hate me. Well guess what, somebody else is not gonna hate me. And even after 11 or 12 years of being online and making YouTube videos it feels crazy to me. It's just like why say anything at all? It just it really just doesn't make sense. But then you do have to think of what is this person saying and what in their life has made them get to the point where they need to hate somebody else for something they love? I don't know, but if you wanna make YouTube videos do it, find something that you love, make content about it, and the nice people will come eventually unless you're making hate videos, then you're basically gonna be cultivating an audience of making hateful content so I guess to each their own, I suppose. Khawa hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm is asking why so much hate for Android? I'm not really sure why you're even asking me that question because my secondary phone is always an Android phone and it has been for the past, when did I get my first Android phone? Oh my god, it was like whenever Google first had there's. It was like the HGC something, I don't know, but it's been a long time. So since then I've always had a secondary Android phone. I love being able to try different games or apps that may not be available for the iPhone. So there's no hate at all. With constant YouTube changes what's your best strategy to remain authentic and avoid burnout and still evolve with it? Constant YouTube changes, that's just something that you have to deal with, not only in YouTube but in life. Things change and it happens and if you don't adapt you're gonna get left behind, so it's not easy. You just gotta do it. Sometimes that's easier said than done. Best strategy to remain authentic, I think just keep making videos about things that you love. For the past couple of weeks, guess what, I haven't felt like making a cooking video because I totally burned myself out over Christmas. I made so many cooking videos that, guess what, going into your next question, to avoid burnout. Don't overdo it. I overdid it in Christmas and now the thought of making a cooking video I'm just like shuttering at the thought of it. But don't worry, I know a lot of you guys want the cooking videos back so I have seen your cry for cooking videos and they will be back. I've been planning a couple out and I think I'm almost ready to film them again. But as far as avoiding burnout, it is inevitable. It really, really is, 'cause there is gonna be a time where you're like (gasping) I can't do this anymore. I gotta stop. Clayton wants to know if you, Jenna, Matt, Ed, and Ro were stranded on an island who would survive? Okay, so here is the order of survival. I'm definitely gone first 'cause I'm completely worthless, I'm sure of that. The only thing that I would be able to bring to this party here, I'm an overpacker. I am so prepared for any situation. I've got extra clothes for the apocalypse. I've even got coffee in my survival bag amongst many knives and weapons, but I still think I'd probably be the first to go. Then Jenna would probably go. Actually you know what, I think Matt would probably go first 'cause I just realized that he was in this. So it would be Matt, and then me, and then Jenna, and then unfortunately it would be Ed and Ro to duke it out, and I know Ro and I think that she would probably fight Ed to the death. Samantha wants to know if I would ever adopt a little brother dog for Mattie or a sister? Yes I would. I know my sister really wants to get a dog, but it is such a huge time commitment, and I think when the time is right or when we find the perfect dog for her we definitely will get him a brother or sister. What do I do in my free time? I'm probably watching Netflix or sleeping, to be honest with you. Justin wants to know what my high score is in HQ Trivia. I think it's 10, that's not very good. Well thank you guys so much for watching this Ask iJ episode. I apologize if it was a little bit rambling and all over the place. I feel like I haven't done one of these for a while, so I love getting a chance to just, I was gonna say sit down, but I'm standing up, so I love standing up and talking to you guys. So thank you again for all of your support. Thank you for watching. Let me know if you guys have any other questions in the comments below and I will probably see you guys there. So that's it, bye.

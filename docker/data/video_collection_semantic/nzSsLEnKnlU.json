    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and we're back with some more Animal Crossing! And today I'm going to visit my friend's island. My friend Ed, you guys have seen him here on my channel before. He is I think actually one of the reasons that I got into Animal Crossing years and years ago. So today we're gonna go check out his island. It's pretty ridiculous. But first, my Ables Store just opened up today. I'm gonna need to put on a really nice outfit so I can look cool for my visit to Ed's island. This is a really nice outfit and I actually think Ed would probably be super into it. I need to try it on. This is beautiful! Look at all these outfits! Look at these shorts! What! These are beautiful outfits! How 'bout some sockies? Oh hello, this is the way to do it. I'm going to spend all of my virtual money. Oh my god, I look so good! I need a hat. Yup, let's do it. Oh my gosh, my look! Okay I need to find a gift to bring Ed. Can you stop following me around? You're making me nervous. You wanna race? Do you wanna race or what do you, do you not wanna race? The problem with Ed is he has probably everything in this game. My house is a mess. You can't even, let's not even talk about it. Is there anything that he could possibly want? Maybe I'll bring him a plant. I know, maybe I'll bring him this ironing set. I'm sure he has it already, but yes I'll buy it. I think it's a nice offering. It's like a nice friendly gesture. Let's go visit my friend Ed. Looks so nice! Look at all of his flowers! I mean he's put over 120 hours into this game. So like if his island isn't cool then (laughing). My outfit looks, I look incredible! Like I just need everyone to just take a look. Just take a look right here, my look. Oh, hi! I'll take a mysterious flooring. Maybe let's do a wallpaper as well. A rock-climbing wall? Oh my god am I glad I bought that! The first thing's first, this is my favorite part. He has a little swap meet. So people can like drop things here. Okay I'll take a look at it. (bright music) Okay that's, that's subpar. I'll leave it. Look at these flowers, super, super cool. Come here, oh come on now! I'm not even sure if Ed is here. He just leaves his island open and then people just come over to visit. He's not even here! This is his office and he has like a little BRB working sign. He's outside, like in the real outdoors. Let's see I should probably drop my gift for him, the ironing set and a succulent plant. My offerings. Let's go inside of his house. I know it's gonna be ridiculous. (gasps) He has a K.K. Slider poster? Oh my gosh, okay, I want him to give me the tour. So I'm gonna wait until he gets back. But who? I don't even know who that is. (yawning) Okay well. Let's do a little shopping. Let's see what kind of outfits he's got in his store today. Beauty boys, (singing) shopping! So I don't seem to be that into his stuff that he has here. I'm happy with my outfit. Nope, nothing caught my eye today, thankfully. I wonder if he'd be upset if I picked one of those other flowers 'cause I need it to make a flower crown. There's nothing good here today. We're gonna buy that. Remember when I said I didn't like any of these and now I'm losing my freaking mind! No, we're done, we're done, we're done. Sure, why not? Great, I need money 'cause I'm spending like like a fiend. Okay, great, that's how much money I've spent at his island already. I'm gonna try to get some fish and I wait until he gets back. Oh a sea bass, wow I haven't caught one of those before. Just kidding! You stupid fish! I'm not catching anything that I don't have already. Look at all these flowers! (mellow instrumental music) Ed's back! He's up and moving. Hi, Ed! - Hey what's up? - So he's on a FaceTime audio call right now. So this is you know a real generic way to do it, but I think it's gonna work. What is that? - Just got this. - [Justine] What just happened? - [Ed] I have the bamboo wand. Here I have this for you. I wrapped it up in wrapping paper. - Oh my goodness! I've never wrapped anything. What is it? What is it gonna be? - [Ed] 'Cause once you wrap it, you can't see what it is again so. - It's a dolly! I picked one of your pink roses. I didn't dig it up I just picked it. - [Ed] That's fine. It's for people to have. So this is where 'cause I, as you know, I work a ton. When I'm working I just sit in this chair and leave my game open and that way I can work but people can still come over. This is my workspace. - Yeah I definitely have adopted that because I was leaving mine open too. And I don't think people, I didn't have a sign 'cause I don't know how to make one. (laughs) - [Ed] These are all rare flowers that are growing. This is a sign to tell people to make sure to put on a mask and stay far away from each other. This is the swap meet which you're familiar with. So people can put stuff here. - What a great idea! I love it! Oh my gosh, now somebody else is coming! - [Ed] Yeah. - Look at that look! Eric is here! Oh you've got a really nice brick bridge. I just built my first incline. Well I'm working on it. I'm gonna tell him I'm mad. - [Ed] He's (mumbling). - Do you have the aggravation? - [Ed] Not yet, no, I only have, I have sneezing. - Oh I don't have that one. I'm yelling at Eric. Do you think he's upset? My favorite thing to do - [Ed] (laughing) Oh my god, we look so mad! - My favorite thing is just to clap and like just not stop. (laughs) - [Ed] I like this one. - Do you remember that old YouTube video where it's like hand Denzel Washington? - [Ed] What is hand? - What is hand? - Hand. - Hand. - Hand. - [Justine] Oh my gosh! - Hand! - Hand! - Hand! - What is that? (bright music) That's pretty great. Oh my god look at your hair. That's really incredible. (bright music) Oh this is nice! Look at that little stage! Oh my gosh I could perform. - [Ed] Well that's where a tent goes and then you can bring in characters using amiibo and amiibo cards. - I'm sorry. - [Ed] And then they'll come here. - What? - Weird requests. - Do you know? Well you know I love amiibo! (laughs) - [Ed] Yeah! - Why can't I get this fish? It's like I've never fished before. Oh my gosh come here you pig! - [Ed] What are you aiming for? - I don't know! I think it's my new shoes. That looks like something I don't have. Oh my gosh! I freaking missed it! - Oh my god! That was a terrible attempt! - (laughing) Oh my god I was so far away from it! I'm not used to playing on a monitor. See ya Eric, have a nice flight! (gasps) I am from Pro Macs. (dramatic music) Look at that! I just unlocked the updated Nook ATM. So I can get stuff. - [Ed] This little quaint space back here. - This is nice oh my gosh! - [Ed] This is my museum. - Wow! - [Ed] So I have extras of those if you want one. And the reason there's trash outside is I'm trying to see if this will attract ants. So - What? - [Ed] (mumbling) on that. This is because I always get deliveries. So there's Amazon boxes outside. - Like this looks really good. The K.K. Slider poster up there is incredible! - [Ed] This is my kitchen, cat food, litter box. I read a lot of books and I have a lot of papers. - I love the Animal Crossing Nintendo Switch. That is definitely worth getting the Switch for. I love those floor lights over there! What is this? Is this your game room? - [Ed] You know I collect weird stuff. - Yes. - [Ed] So it looks like there's wrestling figures in the game. I'm trying to get all of those. I like drinks and beverages so. - Do you have an espresso machine? - [Ed] Not yet. - (gasps) I have one. - [Ed] But I have this thing. It looks like my fridge. And then I can get change in this fridge, play pinball. This game is from the Animal Crossing Pocket Camp. If you link your devices, you can get this brake tapper. - [Justine] I did link mine actually. - [Ed] Yeah, oh also this wall or like those temples in Zelda. - Yeah. - Kinda cool. - This is cool. This is so moody! Oh my gosh I could just hang out here. Oh the peach! - [Ed] This thing has a baby in it for some reason. - That's ridiculous. Can I get in the bathtub though? - [Ed] No but if you eat fruit and then use the toilet. (flushing) It comes out of you and - Shut up! - [Ed] Well actually just eat a bunch of fruit. Do you have any fruit on you right now? - I don't, no, I sold it all. - [Ed] Eat some of these coconuts and then go poop 'em out. - Go poop 'em out, all right that. Oh there's three of them though. Do you want? - No, eat 'em all. - Should I get a good camera angle? - [Ed] Get a nice angle on your face. - Oh! (bright music, gasps) Oh my goodness! And that takes care of that! That's incredible! (flushing) All three of them have exited. - [Ed] (laughs) Oh and you see the wallpaper? It's one from Sahara. It moves - Really? - [Ed] And it blocks out your windows. - Yeah that looks cool! - [Ed] So if you look there's like heat lines too on the wall. - I like having the windows. Can you put the shades up? - And it's good 'cause the sun comes in based on the time of day and stuff. It's adjustable. - No way! Okay this one is awesome! The skulls, I also have a skull flooring. - [Ed] You're glowing! - It is glow in the dark. Turn your lights off. That's a really great wallpaper. - [Ed] That's so cool. Yeah I'm gonna need that rug. - I need to some, some work on my house. I like that it goes out into the hallway too. Look at your little basket backpack. - [Ed] It's cool 'cause I carry a lot of stuff. - And - [Ed] Here - We go! - We go! (chiming, bird cooing) - Yup, definitely worth the wait! - [Ed] So cool. - Are you sneezing? - [Ed] I sneezed and now I'm laughing. - (laughing) Well thanks for hanging out! - [Ed] Yeah. - Wait a minute. Is it really five p.m.? - [Ed] It is five p.m. - Oh my god where did the day go? I have to stop playing this game. I'm disgusted. (laughing) So I wake up like two hours earlier now so that I can get everything done before my shop opens at eight. So I get up at like six even though before the quarantine I'd get up at five. But now it doesn't really matter. Nothing matters except Animal Crossing. Well guys, that's it for this video. Ed has frozen over there. (laughs) Well thanks for hanging out! You guys can go follow Ed on Instagram @doted and on Twitter, doted. Okay bye! (upbeat bass music)",

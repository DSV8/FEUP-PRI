    "transcript": "- Face ID, (beep) this mighty (beep). Once you had a plastic surgery, you won't be able to unlock this mother (beep) I (beep) X. - What? - Yo guys, Jonathan here, with a couple familiar faces, Dave2D, not sure if you need an introduction. - I mean, depends who you ask. - The set might look familiar, I'm out in Canada right now. - Toronto, specifically Toronto. - It's cold, but today, is kinda related to iPhone X, but also related to Pixel 2. There's been a lot of, kinda crazy feedback, with those two phones. So we're gonna do something interesting, something fun. We're gonna read some comments off of all three of our videos, centered around the Pixel 2, and the iPhone X. Dave-- - Let me ask you something, are they mean, like, mean in the way that they're being mean to us, or mean in the way that they're talking about the devices? - They're a little-- - Little bit of both. - Little bit of both. - Okay. - I'm gonna kick it off with Dave. - This video, sucks. The Pixel 2 XL screen burns in matter of weeks, - Oh, yeah. I heard about that. - And you say that it is a common thing with OLED displays. My Samsung S5 display-- - That's right. - Burned after two years, that is okay, but not a few weeks. - Dave, Dave! - Why does the video suck? Alright, not every single OLED panel exhibits this burn-in, but such a big portion of them exhibit it, and people don't even recognize that their phones are burning in. I bet if you looked at the majority of phones, they'd have it. Of the older phones. - You're already looking at me, what do you want me-- - I'm looking at you for, you guys should be nodding in approval. - I don't know, I mean, listen, a lot of people have been all over the screen on that device. People are going heavy at that screen. At least on social media, my Twitter, someone's got problems with that screen every five minutes. - (laughs) It's still a piece of (beep), crappy, ugly, (laughs), crappy, ugly looking fatty iPhone. (Jonathan and Dave laughing) - It's like, picture the person, writing this. - It's a fatty iPhone. It's a fatty iPhone. - What is this guy-- It's still a piece of (beep), crappy, ugly looking fatty iPhone (laughs), put it into the sky and you'll see yourself how ugly the camera is. With love, Pixel 2. - Man, it's weird. You kinda sound like Kermit the Frog, fair, every time I hear him, I'm going to think about that. Every time he hears Kermit the Frog, or me? - You sell out piece of (beep), it's a (beep) phone. How much is Google paying you? (Jonathan laughing) - (beep) neck beard. (Dave laughing loudly) This comes from Guts. - That's all it is? - Yeah. - From YouTube user, Guts. - I mean, he had, like, he was grammatically correct. He got a capital F and a period. - Which, you know what, that adds to it and I'm giving him points for that. - Yeah. - I'm giving him points for accuracy. The funny thing is, with an insult, punctuation being correct, I feel is important. - For sure. - It adds a layer of aggressiveness to it, when you see the period on only two words, it's like, whoa, dude is mad. - That's right, it's very-- - You know what I mean? - 'Cause it was like a (finger thudding). - Yeah. - Yeah! Like the mic drop. - Two words and a period. - It's the period. (all laughing) - Holy (beep), are you using eyeliner? - Gay! - But like look at the punctuation here. - Right? - Two exclamation points. - She's intense. All caps on (beep), no cap on holy, three question marks on eyeliner, triple A, triple Y. - I've gotten that question a lot. - Do you use eyeliner? - I don't. - You have beautiful eyes. - I have really, long eyelashes. - What do you eyelashes have to do with eyeliner? - I think-- - They're not the same thing. - No, but, his long eyelashes give the perception of like, darker-- - Of eyeliner? Oh, okay. I never thought that, but alright. - These cucks, Marques included, always defending Google no matter how bad and how expensive the product is. If this was Samsung, they'd all be bashing it. Google paying these YouTube influencers, cucks, lots of money to say their-- - Again, again, with the large terminology. - Their (beep) products are good. Poor form. - What's a cuck? - A cuck? You know what a cuck is. - Yeah, alright, sorry. - Do we need to go deep? - Well I don't think we can clarify that, while keeping this ad-friendly. - I got demonetized today already. - Okay, alright, never-- - We're cucks! - Goodbye monetization. - (laughs) how the (beep) did you afford the new iPhone you dip (beep). It was all the money we got paid by Google. - Obviously. - Use the Google money, to buy the iPhone. - Correct. - Absolutely. - Fair. You can get a fur suit for less than this phone holy (beep). - A what? - A fur suit. Is that like, are we talking, is it what I think it is? Like, you wear a fur suit? - [Jonathan] Fursuiting.com - Yeah, it's that whole genre, I know nothing about it. - Wait, these things cost $1000? - Those look expensive. - Well, I would think so. - This guy's typical Android user, ugly, (beep) destitute-- - Oh, geez! - Dead loss. - I don't think we can include that one. - That one's pretty good! - iPhone X (laughs). - No, no, read that correctly. - No! iPhone X-tremely (beep). - [Dave And Lewis] iPhone X-tremely (beep). - Well played. - Yeah, that one's not bad, I see what he's doing there. But you know what, he messed it up by capitalizing the I. - He should put the dash. - Kudos to you, for clickbaiting morons, (Dave laughing loudly) to advertise your stupid charger, nothing about iPhone X here, you (beep)-ing four eye (beep). So, like, how does it lead to this end part of the sentence here? - It's a multi-layer burn, man. - It escalates rapidly! It's like okay, yeah, clickbaiting, okay, the charger, but then it's like, well obviously, we're gonna add the last piece on there. - You gotta finish strong. - I like that your glasses had some play in it. - They, you know, well you can tell, I've made the adjustments. - You are without a doubt, the most biased tech YouTuber, on YouTube I've seen so far. - I thought that was me, for sure. - You suck, dude. L-O-L, this is the first and last time, I will ever watch one of your videos. I mean, the only time-- - So intense. - You hear people say what you're saying in this video, is when iSheep try to defend Apple. In my opinion, by making a video like this, you're actually making an Android platform look worse than it is. Don't make excuses for defective products, bro. If you wanna keep it, keep it! But don't try to lie to yourself, and everyone else along the way. - Whoa, heavy. - Don't forget the LOL. - The L-O-L, yeah. - At the end, 'cause it's really lighthearted. - It's like JK. - Of course. - 'Cause if it's actually lighthearted-- - JK, it's okay, I'm just, I'm just taking a little jab here. - Well, that is kinda-- (Dave laughing) - MKBHD just sucked Google's (beep). - On your video? - On my channel, yeah. (beep) review, totally disagree, (beep) phone for 800 bucks. These are terrible. - I know. - Red Ace, that's classy, dude. Trying putting your (beep) I'm front of the camera to see if it can recognize an (beep). (upbeat jazz music) - As a face? (Dave and Jonathan laughing) Is that what he's going for? - A very puckered face, maybe. - You know what you see, when you see a comment like that, you can sense the speed at which he wrote it, right? - 'Cause it was edited. - Trying, putting-- - No, but he still edited it. - Oh, man. - That's the weird part. - Wow. - That's my favorite part, trying putting your ass I'm front of the camera. - And he edited it. Wow. - Like what was the first draft? - Yeah, right. Stupid video, point less information. Point less. Which, I mean, he's allowed to have that opinion. - He's allowed to point less. - Yeah, it's one point less. Love your videos, all caps, hate your titles. (Dave laughing loudly) If I wasn't already a fan, I would completely avoid this channel, due to this horrible clickbait title. 35 thumbs up. - Dang. - You're baitin'. - Can I just like, say something here? - Yeah, please. - Is that, am I, do I have the stage here for a minute? - It's your home. - It's kind of an odd thing to click on a video, and then claim that you were baited, that it was clickbait, because ultimately if you, if your you know, system for evaluating clickbait was valid, then you would avoid the clickbait before you were baited, because you were so great at sensing clickbait. - Lou's going deep here. - Well I'm just saying, who's guilty here? The fishermen or the fish? - The fisherman if he's putting bait on his hooks. - Yeah but the fish is the one who takes it. - I don't think that makes him guilty. - Of course it does. (Lewis laughing loudly) Perfect, misspelled bait, click, oh. - Ci-click. - Click. - C-K-L-I-C-K, click bait you trash. - Trash. - Trash! - Now here's the other thing, where I'll kinda be on your side with this, if enough people call it clickbait, it is clickbait, you know? But ultimately the decision's up to them whether or not they felt they got value out of the video. - (beep) so called tech viewers, keep making excuses for this 800 plus Dollars phone. - I'm just, I'm confused as to why tech products make people so angry. - It's because it's expensive. - Yeah, but the thing is, this is supposed to be, an exciting, compelling realm, these are supposed to be enthusiasts, but they want you to be as angry as they are. You know what I mean? That's the only way to satisfy them. - That's right, they're not too-- - Thing is, maybe you weren't that angry that day. - They weren't that angry? - No, you! - I wasn't angry at all. - Ever! You like like, you meant to say you look like, you look like if Keemstar and Scarce had a child. That's not bad. Actually, I kind of like this comment. It's just kinda, it's very observant. Worst video of the year, wasted five minutes that I cannot get back. Do you know what I love about that comment? With the time I spent that I cannot get back, is the funny thing is, what about the time you spent to write the comment to talk about the time you spent that you couldn't get, like wouldn't you evacuate the scene as quickly as possible, if you were counting time? - Unsubbed, because you're just like that ugly phone reviewer who kissed Google's (beep) seller. Who's the guy? - Who's the ugly phone reviewer? - I assume all of us, anyone. - That's true. Who the (beep) cares about unboxing, it's the same (beep) all the time. So when is the drop test? - Oh! As if that's-- - You know how much hate I would get for drop tests? - You guys would rather see him break a phone, rather than open and share the experience? - Well, don't say you guys, this is is one individual. - That's true. - It's over, that was fun. That was actually, why is that fun? It's like, cool, YouTube, it's a fun place, check it out sometime. - Thank you, guys, for watching. This was kinda fun! If this is something you guys wanna see, let me know by dropping a like down below, and maybe, who else should we do this with? Drop a comment down below. - Oh yeah, let us know. - Unbox Therapy, Dave2D, links below. Check out us unboxing, it's actually kind of amazing. Kinda cool, I got to see that go down. It was something else. - You were in it. - That's true. - Yeah, man. - And thanks for coming up here, man. - Canada. - Yeah. - The place of dreams. (beep) You into that, Lou? - I mean... - Look at that one. - That's a costume? - I think it looked cool for like a second, but if they're-- - No, but like-- - Wait, why, what? - You would spend a thousand bucks on it? - On a fur suit? - Well, I think for them it's a real... There's a lot of enthusiasm. They go to an event, they meet other people in their suits, it's a whole ecosystem there.",

    "transcript": "One thing we can all agree on is technology is progressing far faster than most people can keep up with. Today we'll be taking apart the new Pixel 7A and talking about something you should probably be wary of moving forward. Let's get started. [Intro] As we discovered in our durability test of Google's new Pixel 7A, the back panel is made from plastic and we don't have to worry about it shattering during this removal. I'll add some heat to help soften the adhesive holding everything together. Unfortunately though, that same heat that helps detach the glue also melts the back panel. It's not the first time this sword has fallen apart. Not a huge deal. Replacement back panels for last year's 6A can be found for about $15...which coincidentally is the same price as my JerryRigEverything Knife. Pretty inexpensive. I imagine this year's 7A back panel will follow in those same low-cost footsteps. I really am a fan of this unbreakable back plate. Speaking of following footsteps, Google did take a page out of Apple's book with some non-standard screwage. We have fifteen T4 screws, and one much tinier T2 screw that's thrown in there just for kicks and giggles. A T2 isn't something most people have laying around, so I'll include this toolkit down in the video description as well for those of you who like to be prepared. The internal plastic protection comes off in chunks. The top left corner comes off first, and then once the LED camera flash is detached, the rest of the plastics can pull away from the phone. This also includes the 7 watt wireless charging coil. I am glad this coil is here of course, don't get me wrong, but 7 watts worth of charging is the slowest we've seen in a long while. Google tossed in another tiny T2 screw just for funsies. It's next to the charging port plug. I'll set that metal plate off to the side and disconnect the battery plug like a little Lego. And then we can pull out the battery. There is a clear nifty little plastic pull tab here to help pry the battery up and out of the phone, but it's still kind of difficult to pull without applying pressure to the rest of the circuits. So I do have to say, I like Apple's magic pull tabs a bit better. Finally, the battery's out, all 4,385 milliamp hours of it. And interestingly enough, the Pixel 7A has 30 milliamp hours more battery life than the regular Pixel 7. And as we all know, every milli counts. I can remove the SIM card tray. There's one more screw holding down the top stereo speaker. It has a red rubber ring around the opening that helps maintain the IP67 water resistance rating. And then the motherboard can lift up and out of the phone. Kinda. There's a tricky little screen ribbon cable all accordioned up and screwed into the bottom of the motherboard. It's a tad more complex of a design than we normally see on Pixel phones, but it's not impossible and we've definitely seen worse. With the motherboard officially out we can get our first glimpse of the main 64 megapixel camera which does have OIS. Then we have the 12 megapixel ultra wide camera that does not have OIS. Both of the units are built into the same plastic housing. The front facing camera is also made with plastic and is 13 megapixels with no OIS. The 18 watt USB-C charging board is soldered to the main board with a waterproofing red rubber ring around the lip. We also have some thermal foam on the board that helps transfer heat from the processor to the frame of the phone. Not quite as intensive as the motorized aerial active cooler flap we found on the ROG7, but this phone is also 3x less expensive. The underscreen fingerprint reader that didn't work for me is also visible back here in its spot underneath the battery. The circular vibration motor is in the bottom right corner, and we have the lower stereo loudspeaker in the left corner which has some included waterproofing mesh over the opening to seal off this hole from liquid. Not too shabby. The thing that really caught my attention though on the Pixel 7A is the huge rectangular cutout in the center of the screen below the pixels. A hidden window of sorts that Google never mentioned. We've seen similar squares a few times on smartphones with invisible underscreen cameras like the ZTE Axon 40. And to be totally fair, it does look like Google is only using this current cutout for the proximity and light sensors, and not hiding hidden cameras. But for people saying Google would never intentionally hide hardware...that might be true, but sometimes Google has forgotten to mention important little details like hidden microphones in their Nest security devices. All I'm saying is that it's good to be on your toes. Technology is advancing faster than regulation can keep up, and most current politicians were born before the microwave and don't even know the difference between a cookie and a bitcoin. So from a technology perspective, it's always a good idea to see the insides before the insides see you. With the motherboard and battery back in place we can get the metal bracket installed and the back plastic screwed in. And even after disassembly, everything still turns on. I'm a fan of the 7A. I think Google has made a good phone for a good price. And while I don't think Google is necessarily spying on us...I mean, besides already knowing everything, there are most likely more nefarious pieces of hardware out there. And invisible underscreen cameras do already exist and will be an issue in the future. You can let the AI know that you're ahead of the game and already keeping an eye on your hardware by grabbing one of my Teardown Skins for your own phone. I'll leave a link down in the description. Let me know what device you want to see the insides of next down in the comments. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.",

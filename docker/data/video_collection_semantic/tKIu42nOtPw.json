    "transcript": "(dubstep music) - Jeremy, in GNS3 version 2.2, I believe you changed the APIs of GNS3, is that right? - That's correct. - And, you know, the whole world's moving towards program ability that's just, kind of, pushing this whole network automation, network programmability thing. But GNS3 has had an API out for a while? - Yes, since version 2.0, I think. Yep. - OK. So, tell me, what kind of API is it? - So, this is a REST API. - So, if I have a GNS3 client. So this is like the GUI, yeah? - Yeah. - When it talks to the VM, is that using a REST API? - Yes. - So there's REST here? - Yeah, the REST API is there. It's basically a HTTP based API. - Yep. And, I saw in some of your documentation, you had it as JSON. What is that? - So JSON is a format we use to send the information. - Yep. - Using the REST API. - So, basically, when you do a REST call to the VM. - Yep. - The data's formatted in this JSON-- - In JSON format, yes. - OK, but from our point of view, this is cool. Like, the GUI does it. But is it possible to write a Python script or something-- - You can use a Python script or use a tool like cURL. - Yep. - To directly use this API to talk to the server. - OK, so let's talk about that now. Because I've actually just said GUI to VM, but that's not entirely correct, is it? It should be the controller, is it? - It's the controller, yes. GNS3 controller. - So, in a separate video, we spoke about the GNS3 architecture, so if you wanna learn more about the architecture, have a look at that video. But the control is sort of the brain, for lack of a better word, yeah? - Yeah. - Of GNS3? Actually, the GUI is talking to the controller? - Yep. - And this talks to, what you call, if I remember right, server processors? - Server processors or computes. - Sorry, compute? - Yes. - So the compute processors then talk to the-- - Emulators. - Emulators. - Yeah. - So that would be (mumbles) and this could be QEMU or whatever, yeah? - Yep. - So, what we're gonna talk about now is mainly this piece. The REST. - The REST API. - OK, so I could use cURL. What's cURL? - cURL is a tool-- - Command line-- - Command line tool. - Yeah. - That you can use to create, like, API request. - So it's command line URL. So just, if you're not aware, you could use, like, a web browser or something to go to a URL. This is just doing it through the CLI. - Yes. - And basically, what you are doing here is you could push a REST call to the controller, rather than using HTTP in a browser or something. - Exactly. - You use the command line, yeah? - Yeah, so you can, for instance, tell cURL I want to get all the notes from that project, using the API, and you would get it, like, in JSON format. - Yes, so it's returned in JSON format? - Yeah. - And I mean, I could do the same thing with Python. - Yes. - I could use, what's it called, requests-- - Requests, like the Python module. - Yeah, so Requests is a Python module, to talk to-- - To, like, HTTP based request. - And is it requests or request? - Request. - Without the S, yeah? - S, I think. - Oh, has it got S in it? - Yeah, Requests, I think. - OK, so, basically, you could write a Python script. - Yep. - The GUI's doing this anyway. You could use cURL-- - You could use cURL. Use any program that does HTTP request. - So let's talk a little bit about REST, because, I mean, you're very much a programmer, but a lot of us aren't. - No. - In REST, if I wanna get a list of nodes, like the example you used, from a project. What kind of REST call is that? - So it will be a GET call. - So, like, HTTP GET? - HTTP GET, yes. - Like when you go to a server with a browser, you do a GET, don't you? - Yes. - That just gets the information? - Gets the information. - But if I wanted to create a project, what would I use then? - Then you will create a POST request. - So it's POST to create. - Yeah. - So GET just gets it. - Yeah. - POST is to create something, yeah? - Well, yes. - This would create a project? - Yeah. You also have a PUT request. - PUT? Yeah, what's that? - That's usually to update information on a server. To update node data, for instance. - OK, so if I wanted to get, like, a list of nodes. In a project, I'll use a GET? - You will use GET. - This would create-- - To create something. Like a node, a link. - OK. - Anything, you will use POST. - And then this we use-- - To update something. A project, a node, anything. And you also have DELETE. - Oh, DELETE, yeah? - Yeah. DELETE, and DELETE is used as a name (mumbles). To delete anything like node, link, project. - So you could automate an entire project. All the nodes, all the links, just using-- - Everything using API. You can create a project, control your project, delete a link, create a node, update a node, anything. - I mean, that's what the GUIs doing anyway, isn't it? - Yes. So GUI uses the REST API to control everything in the GNS3. - So one of the things someone said is, like, they wanna create a console based GUI. They could do that-- - You could do that, yes. - But that's not something you're gonna do. - That's not something we have on the road map, no. - So it's not on the roadmap, but do you, there's nothing stopping me or anyone else creating? - Anyone can create his own tool using the API. There's no limitation. - Big question. Where do we learn about the API? - So, the API, we have a website where all the API documentation is. It's hosted on http://www.api.gns3.net - So http://www.api.gns3.net? - Yes. - OK. - That's where you go and you have the API documentation. - Yep. - What the different calls do, how to use API, basically. - Great. If anyone wants to learn how to use the API, they can go there, they can see the APIs. And a big question, 'cause this, often, is something that people find frustrating, is different versions, the API changes. - Yes. - That has happened in 2.2, hasn't it? - In 2.2, we have some changes. Especially around appliances and templates. We have, like, you can manage the templates directly on the GNS3 controller. So you have new endpoints for templates. And also, there was minor changes around the appliance endpoints. - OK, but going forward, the API could change? But you're gonna try and keep it minimal, will you? - We will try to keep it minimal, or we were going to change a version of the API. - Oh, OK. So what version of API will it be with 2.2? - It will be, it's this version two, of the API. But someday, we might, if the changes are major, we will use version three. - OK. Anything else you wanna tell us about the API? - No, nothing, that's everything. - I mean, just for everyone's benefit. Again, this API that we're talking about, is between the clients and the controller. - Yep. - But you do use REST between the controller and the compute nodes. But that's internal, isn't it? - That's internal. You're not supposed to use this API, use a public API for the GNS3 controller. - That's great, Jeremy. Thanks so much. - Yeah, you're welcome. - So, if you wanna try it out, have a look at http://www.api.gns3.net, was it? - That's correct, yes. - Yep. And, you know, you could use Python, anything like that. Bash scripts or just use cURL to, you know, interact with the GNS3 server. Brilliant, Jeremy. Thanks. - Yep, you're welcome. (dubstep music)",

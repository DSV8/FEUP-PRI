    "transcript": "now pretty much for as long as I can remember I've wanted to build a gaming PC using exclusively wish crap so when toasty Bros reached out saying that they want to enter the death match Arena of death AliExpress versus wish I had to accept the gauntlet that had been thrown and after winning the coin toss I had to choose wish because I'm pretty much fulfilling a lifelong dream at this point or like a like a three year long dream before we get into that though we need to hear from today's video sponsor that helped pay for whatever is about to happen better stronger and more virile the Corsair 5000t is a Powerhouse of a case pre-loaded down with enough RGB to make any 14 year old weep and with its cavernous interior and generous radiator support you can fit enough cooling to satiate even the most insane Nvidia engineer's appetite so get the 5000 T using the link in the video description thank you when it comes to the budget for The Showdown we decided on 800 US Dollars and that is not including tax and shipping I may have screwed up my budget a little but we'll get into that a bit later first let's unbox all the wish crap wow I've actually kind of missed the wish plastic dumpster bags although in all fairness to wish all this stuff shipped in like two weeks which is very impressive for wish oh and I'll have toasty Bros video with their AliExpress build Linked In the description below so go and check out their efforts so you can clearly compare the quality of the two systems let's start with the big bag wow that's like most of the PC in there okay that's quite promising description of contents and that seems to be the name of a CPU I recognize I can't quite remember if that's the one I bought because it's been a while that is a lot of bubble wrap it's nice to see that whatever they sent is nice and safe that's a really nice touch they add a little sachet of thermal paste with a CPU and then it seems to actually be the CPU that it says on the box that is a very good start well done wish let's check out the next random package next let's try the two random envelopes we've got hard disk and I actually Splurge for this getting a 240 gig SSD oh it's a kingdian drive okay I've used one of these in a build a while ago and it was a functional SSD and this one is 240 gigs what a beauty foreign because of all the plastic shopping on wish really feels like lobotomizing a turtle let's see it's looking round but it should get the job done one thing it's kind of weird about it though it comes with a tiny little screwdriver and a bunch of case screws that is a very unusual accessory for Ram I'm not gonna lie I don't think I've ever seen that before but I guess it's a nice touch this one kind of looks like it's got its teeth kicked in a bit apparently it is a computer supply which I'm assuming is the power supply I think this is the least confidence inspiring power supply box I have ever seen oh never mind it says professional on it so it's probably very good just wrapped it in some more soft plastic for good measure oh that is a very light Hollow feeling power supply although apparently it's a thousand watt power supply which I think makes this the bargain of the century this thing has some real IED ignition Source Vibes to it and this is a cool Moon MX6 CPU Cooler which is apparently quiet hydraulic and only has a 90 millimeter fan hopefully that xeon's not too hard for it to cool whoa that is six heat pipes that make direct contact with the CPU beneath and then we've got these little towers it actually kind of looks like a little baby noctuar nhd-15 the fans actually have very crudely implemented LEDs on the inside so they're even gonna light up this again actually seems like a reasonable CPU Cooler I love how all it takes for wish to impress you is just getting a product that doesn't look like it's going to give you dysentery ooh a dumpster bag inside a dumpster bag it's always very promising when the box that your new motherboard's probably in looks like it was used as a seat cushion by the delivery driver it's even more promising when the rear i o Shield looks like it's been involved in a fire recently but at least we get a nice sachet of thermal paste with the motherboard what happened to this rear IO Shield well there's our motherboard I get the distinct impression this motherboard was saved from a PC that survived the warehouse fire look at that nice creative use of a piece of paper there's a socket protector there I'm sure that's delivery driver butt proof when it comes to the graphics card I was quite Brave according to wish this is an RTX 2060 but this is wish we're talking about one of the most reliable sources of scam graphics cards in the world so chances are very high this is just a fake GTS 450. hey it may very well be debating me here but this actually looks like a real box what the hell we'll all be damned that actually looks like a real RTX 3060. it doesn't even see Tales scam graphics card signs we even get a backplate on this bad boy that's awesome now we just need to hope it works but this is a really good start so far oh no way it's a Corsair case foreign that's just a new one box Corsair 100r to me it seems a bit like whisp has reformed a little bit going from a scam retailer to just a mostly crappy retailer uh having said that we don't know if any of this stuff works yet so let's build the PC and find out first we need to talk about the budget this is what everything cost bringing us to a total of about 827 Canadian dollars and if we use the exchange rate at the time when I bought all this stuff our grand total is about 660 US Dollars about a hundred and thirty dollars under budget but it's not my fault buying stuff on wish is really hard everything's either weirdly cheap or stupidly expensive when it comes to CPUs and motherboards if you want anything more modern than that old Xeon I bought you're looking at hundreds of dollars more so my choice was either go a hundred and thirty dollars under a budget or a hundred and thirty dollars over budget and I'd much rather go under than over but that does mean that the toasty Bros system is most likely going to curb stomp mine in terms of performance but like I've said so many times in today's video that is future David's problem first let's assemble the weird Abomination and see if it even works now I'd say the first step is to prep the house fire victim motherboard for installation I'm gonna be real Brave about it and not test the system box top before installing it into a case just because I like to live dangerously you know okay let's see the state of the pins under that paper socket cover it it actually kind of seems like the bit of paper did its job those pins look fine now considering the fact that they gave us a screwdriver with the ram I kind of feel like I need to try and build the PC using only the screwdriver which feels like a really stupid idea considering that that is one of the smallest Phillips head screwdrivers I think I've ever seen we are using DDR3 which meant that this 16 gigs was actually quite affordable even though it came with a screwdriver next I think we should Mount the Kirkland brand nhd15 on the little CPU wow that's not very much mounting hardware it almost seems like some variation of stock Intel cooler mounting plastic clip MacGyver on the little bracket it tells you which Notch to slip the little plastic thingy in so I think we need to do the middle notch and then in terms of thermal paste I'm going to use the very kindly supplied sachet of thermal paste squeeze that out onto there wow that is a lot of thermal paste and then the coolers should go on quite straightforward we just oh wow that felt very much like I was destroying the Earth and with that I think we can start prepping the case now that is a very plain black box of ow although I'm not really complaining at least it pretends to have some ventilation on the front oh we get some acoustic foam on the inside of the side panel there's even acoustic foam on the top of the case and along the back side panel although the case does feel like it's made out of melted down bits of spam can oh that is a shockingly disgusting rare iot Shield and it actually feels like if you push too hard you're gonna break the back of the case out oh there we go that is that is in next up I'm going to install the power supply and wow there is very little going on inside this thousand watt power supply I'd be surprised if this doesn't explode by the end of the video it even comes with a single supplemental 8-pin Graphics power cable that is some fancy thousand watt power supply action now this is a bit of an odd problem to have but neither the case nor the power supply come with the correct power supply mounting screws so I'm gonna have to use some for my own stash foreign for ants but it seems to be doing the job yeah these little Ram screwdrivers are great liners should have just licensed these yeah why spent years trying to design a screwdriver with the perfect screwdriver is just bundled with wish Ram all along yeah you know like magnetized tips are such a bougie invention oh yeah the thread is too big so the screwdriver actually can't screen okay I'm gonna have to use an inferior screwdriver for this okay so now we just need to Cable manage this bad boy then we can drop a GPU in there and see if it actually works which I am excited and I immediately ran into a problem well that is a very poorly placed cable routing hole and I think it means I may have to Route the CPU power up around the front like some kind of animal but plugging in the CPU power was way easier said than done ah oh come on but I figured it out eventually yes oh it's finally in luckily the rest of the cable management was a bit easy now is the moment we've all been waiting for will this bucket of crap actually start up or explode taking me with it let's find out no way oh we've got some RGB happening very nice although my excitement was short-lived despite the mesmerizing RGB and a restart the system just wouldn't post the problem is we don't have any kind of like boot LEDs or anything like that on the motherboard so it's gonna be very hard to diagnose any issues with it my first thought was that I screwed up with the CPU and motherboard pairing how much do you want to bet that CPU isn't compatible with this motherboard yay luckily I had a CPU lying in a pile somewhere that I could use to test the motherboard but swapping out the CPU is again easier said than done that is a really stupid mod it won't unclip with tensions Rising I decided to remove the motherboard for easier access what is this Mount am I just really dumb see it just doesn't unclip and it just pulls the whole cooler over I don't know man The Rage of a thousand suns is building up in me here come on okay I'm gonna get gloves oh there we go now two things first off considering that I had to use the power of an enraged hippo to unclip that I hope I didn't break the motherboard and the second thing is I forgot to remove the film of plastic on the bottom of the CPU Cooler uh now that's not why it wasn't booting but um yeah it's it's good that it didn't boot because otherwise it would have caught on fire a little embarrassing now Swifty moving attention back to the terrible CPU Cooler with the mounting in place you can't remove the CPU so you have to take the whole bracket off oh I really wish I tested the system before I finished building it now to spare you from having to witness a whole bunch more shouting long story short after spending hours testing different CPUs and looking for new bioses and whatever the problem was that IED ignition Source power supply it just wasn't working after I swapped it out the system just kind of worked fine so now that we've figured out what's wrong with the system and I lost a couple of years of life expectancy let's see how the system runs um I may have skimped on the CPU a little bit too hard in this build but in my defense any reasonably modern CPU they sell for like a starting price of 8 million dollars so it was either this or nothing to be honest which unfortunately means the RTX 2060 is not really doing a whole lot in GTA 5 but generally the temperatures are pretty good and it's relatively quiet uh with that let's try a more demanding game now Battlefield 5 at 1080p High settings is running almost better than GTA 5 which doesn't seem to like quad cores very much and as you can see the temperatures have jumped up significantly I've been playing for about 20 minutes now honestly it's running better than I was expecting and it's utilizing more of the RTX 2060 although if we got a better CPU we would have gotten a lot more performance so I'm actually kind of hoping the toasty Bros also couldn't get a very powerful CPU because that's going to be the easiest way for them to beat this system cyberpunk preset High 1080P and um we're almost at 60 frames per second that may not be a very high frame rate but it's quite a smooth delivery of that frame rate in the same way that with GTA 5 we didn't have a very high frame rate but it was quite a smooth delivery the fact is that this is a wish gaming system that doesn't have a fake GTS 450 in it kind of blows my mind a little bit now in terms of benchmarks for comparing with the toasty Bros system we agreed on GTA 5 at high settings cyberpunk at high settings and cinebench R20 so go watch their video to decide who was the winner of this Death Match Arena of death and with that what did we learn in today's video well if a power supply emerges from a dumpster bag like a Naz ghoul you probably shouldn't plug it into your system anyway thank you for watching before you go and check out toasty Bros system just stick around for an alternate intro to this video that I decided to not use anyway thank you for watching until the next video bye-bye the year is 17 31. a gauntlet was cast from the house of bro toasty challenging the alliance of starving to a showdown in the death match Arena of death AliExpress versus wish Coupe will prevail thank you foreign",

    "description": "Technology Connections now has a Patreon!  Link below The late 1970's and early 1980's were a frightening time to be a video enthusiast.  Two formats are duking it out and trying to assert their dominance, and although Sony was first* to market with their Betamax machine, they were caught off guard by JVC's competing VHS system which, rather than focus on pedantic details like cassette design and technical perfection, strived to make a cheap, versatile format that worked.  This is part one of the story of the VHS and Betamax format war.  Part two will be following shortly.  Part Two:    Was the quality of Beta really better?

    "transcript": "Say its 1979 and youve just decided to blow two whole paychecks on one of these new fangled video cassette recorders. Congratulations on your life-changing decision! But now comes the time to ask yourself, which one should you buy??? Two systems are vying for your money, each packing their own set of unique features. A format wars a brewin, how do you know which choice is the right one??? Since a startlingly large percentage of viewers may have never used or even seen a videocassette recorder, lets just throw it in your face and make clear that were talking about the format war between VHS, the winner which was released in 1976 and stayed relevant until around 2003, and Betamax, the loser which actually predated VHS by a year but became the butt of jokes by the late 1980s. The format war between Beta and VHS is widely studied even today in business classes the world over. In this video, well explore the history of the format war, and Ill be comparing two machines which were both on sale in 1979, and I think by the end youll be able to see why VHS left Beta in the dust Quick side notes--this video discusses the format war as it took place in the United States. As such, Philips excellent and revolutionary Video 2000 format, which never made it to the US, is not being discussed. Beta was not the first consumer videocassette format--that title goes to Philips VCR format unless you count the professional U-Matic, but Phillips was ultimately unsuccessful. Betamax is regarded as the first consumer format to achieve any sort of widespread success. Here we are. The pinnacle of modern engineering. You can even smell it. Trust me, these machines smell.groovy. On the left, we have an RCA VDT-600, a fully-featured VHS model built in Japan by the Matsushita corporation (the parent of Panasonic) under license from the Japan Victor Company, or JVC, the inventors of VHS, and branded and sold by the Radio Corporation of America, or RCA. Pay attention to that jumbled mess of a who-built-it, because it will be important later. On our right, we have a Sony SL-5400, a high-end Betamax model (which came to be known simply as Beta) made in Japan by Sony, for Sony, and sold as a Sony. Glad we got that out of the way. So lets start with a physical overview of these two machines. In the looks department, Id say this is kind of a tie. The Sony doesnt exactly look sleek, in fact it looks kind of like a giant brick. Very sharp edges, and very straight lines. But, its fit-and-finish is excellent, and the non-nonsense style almost makes it handsome. The clock is very clear and attractive, with a charming programming display, and the buttons are labeled on both the top and the edge. The RCA, on the other hand, looks a fair bit bulkier, but you could say more interesting. Its sloping front allows the clock-timer to be seen from a top-down view, and helps to minimise its bulky appearance. But the buttons are far clunkier, with weird color choices for their tops. RCAs decision to use mixed-case font for labeling makes the machine appear perhaps a little less professional, but sort of gives it some modern-day charm. Tuning channels is accomplished on the RCA behind this front panel, where youll also find the tracking knob. Channel tuning on the Sony is done up top. See in these days, electronic tuners were hella expensive. So instead, VCRs had either big-ol knobs like this, or theyd have a series of tiny mechanical tuners each tied to a button. Youd pick which 14 or so channels youd want to be able to record, and set them with these little switches and thumbwheels. Then youd simply select between them with the buttons, with each button corresponding to one of these doohickeys. Often the VCR would come with replacement inserts to label these with the actual channel numbers. Sony gives you camera inputs on the front of the machine, but the audio input is strangely a inch audio jack rather than a standard plug. RCA gives you standard connections, but they are in back. Interestingly, the Sony machine has hardly any LEDs used in its design. Apart from the timer programming display for tape length and this one little indicator, all of the lights are either small incandescent bulbs, or in the case of the channel indicators, tiny green fluorescent lamps, similar to the ordinary orange neon lamp you find in a power strip, but with a green phosphor coating the inside of the glass envelope. The RCA model, on the other hand, makes extensive use of LEDs, the only incandescent bulb being located inside the cassette mechanism, working as part of the end-of-tape sensor. Lets get all touchy-feely. When using these machines, theres a clear winner in the ergonomics department. The Sony was obviously designed to make the operational experience a pleasant one. The power switch moves silently--no click here--but decisively with clear physical indentations between its positions. Each of the piano-key buttons is easy to press. And when you press eject to raise the cassette tray, the machine seems to greet you with a fine, may I have your cassette, sir? When you lower the cassette into the machine, it immediately makes the most anti-climactic sound in the history of ever, the sound coming from the action of threading the tape. See, Beta machines usually kept the tape threaded at all times, even during fast forwarding or rewinding, but there are exceptions, notably Sanyo built machines. Again, pressing play takes little force, and as the tape is already threaded, you get a picture pretty quickly. Now heres where the RCA machine starts to look bad. The power switch isnt quite so nice, no its not a bad switch, but not a satisfying one. Its just a switch. The red LED lights up, and for those wondering why theres an indicator for Dew, thats because these early VCRs were often lugged around with a camera to record lifes precious moments, and RCA, I mean Matsushita, added a dew sensor to prevent operation of the machine if a cold VCR was brought into a warm, humid room, causing condensation to form on mechanical components. Pretty thoughtful, actually. Anyway, back to business. Pressing the eject button on this machine requires smashing your finger into the button like you smash X when playing Gran Turismo 3. Once youve hurt your finger enough to actually release the tray, the machine says GIMME A TAPE! No money spent on dampers here, no sir. Lowering the tape into the machine does, well, nothing. This machine wont do a thing until you press a button. Get ready, cause that play button isnt any easier to press. Once youve jammed it in there, the machine then lazily threads the tape around the head drum, and eventually, you get a picture. BUT, we can overlook minor inconveniences if its a more capable machine, right? Well, heres where things start to get interesting. Sony was already forced to play catch-up in 1979, and a lot of that had to do with the cassette itself. Speaking of, lets have a look at those. A VHS cassette is still a somewhat common sight, and you probably know what it looks like. Usually black, but not always!, the cassette measures 187 mm wide, 103 mm deep, and 25 mm thick. Two windows allow you to see the internal reels so you can see how much tape is on each reel, and thus you can tell roughly where you are along the length of the of tape. A very utilitarian design, the cassette just is. Nothing fancy here. The Beta cassette is a good deal smaller than the VHS cassette, with dimensions of 156 mm wide, 96 mm deep, and 25 mm thick. This would prove a fatal mistake, as youll soon see. The identical thickness isnt much of a surprise as both Beta and VHS used half inch wide magnetic tape. Design wise, the Beta cassette is more visually interesting. Most Beta cassettes only had a window on the left-hand reel, allowing you to see how much tape was remaining, but not how much was used. I suppose Sony thought knowing how much tape was left was most important, but it was also annoying as hell. Case in point: particularly with prerecorded tapes, you cant tell if a tape is rewound all the way! I know just by looking at this VHS tape that its not quite at the beginning. But for Beta, the asymmetrical artsiness of the cassette means that you really dont know with certainty if that tape is completely rewound. But it wasnt just that annoying little quirk, in fact most of Betas problems come directly from this cassette design. Lets take a step back in time and go over a few things. When developing the format, Sony took the old adage of size matters the wrong way. See, Betamax was pretty much just a shrunken down version of U-Matic, Sonys earlier inch cassette format used in broadcasting. U-Matic had a recording time of 1 hour, which was fine for television studios, as there would usually be multiple machines handling multiple tapes for things like commercial breaks, and there was always a broadcast technician able to switch between them and load up new tapes. Sony rather naively assumed that 1 hour was therefore a fine benchmark for a consumer format, and kept that their goal for the Betamax machine. This went hand in hand with Sonys desire to keep the cassette on the smaller side--they used their company handbook as a template for a Convenient size. Trouble is, worrying about that was the wrong thing to do. Sony released the Betamax system in 1975 with L-500 tapes, the standard length that ran for 1 hour. L-750 tapes were also available which could run for an hour and a half, but that was it. So, in comes the revolutionary VCR, and early adopters were quickly annoyed with that 90 minute--at best--recording time. See, the whole point of a VCR is to allow you to record shows while youre not home, preventing you from missing a show you really wanted to watch. A 90 minute recording time meant a lot of programs couldnt be recorded. For example, movies would routinely take up at least a 2 hour broadcast, with commercial breaks built in. But this is America, dammit, and the most important thing we need to record is a football game. That aint gonna work with Beta. (Meanwhile), JVC is busy developing their soon-to-be unveiled VHS format. Fun fact, VHS stands for Video Home System. You know, cause thats definitely the order those three words belong in. Anyway, JVCs system used a larger cassette which--guess what--HAS MORE TAPE IN IT! This meant that right out of the gate, the VHS system had Sony beat with a 2 hour recording time on a standard T-120 cassette. Lets take these cassettes apart and compare whats on the inside. Obviously these internal tape reels are way smaller on the Beta tape, so to have the same length of tape as this cassette, the tape would need to be impractically thin. To be clear, the signals recorded on the tape arent compatible in any way. The machines record onto the tape in very different fashions with incompatible signals, but as its otherwise identical tape, the speed the tape runs through each format is pretty close so the overall length of tape was most important (still, VHS did run a little bit slower). Here are two blank tapes, one Beta, one VHS. Youll see that the L-750 cassette contains 222 meters of tape (the 750 means 750 feet of tape). Remember, the L-750 is the long version with thinner than normal tape. But this T-120, the standard VHS length, has 24 more meters of tape. A T-160, the most common long VHS cassette, has 327 meters of tape, almost 50% more than the L-750. Sony did release the ultra-thin (and somewhat rare) L-830, but this wasnt a huge deal as it only squeezed an extra 10 minutes of recording time on early machines. Just by the look of these tapes, Sony seemed to be at a huge disadvantage here. (Meanwhile), The American company RCA had a rather large part in ensuring VHS would end up winning the format war. See, before Beta was even released, RCA was interested in building a videotape recorder of their own. But they heard about Sonys work on Betamax, and decided that maybe theyd be better of to just license the technology and ask Sony to build machines for them. But there were 2 problems. First was that Sony wasnt all that excited to build machines for other people, let alone let others build copies. And second was their stubbornness on recording time. RCA reps reportedly asked the Sony guys if a longer recording time was possible, and sony said Maybe someday. Pft. PFT. Dont bother with them! So RCA found out about what JVC was doing. Already they were more excited about JVCs product, because if could record 2 hours. RCA asked if a longer recording time was possible, and JVC gave a long answer about reduced image quality and maybe its not such a good idea but I guess yes it would be technically possible so long as you kept that reduced picture quality in mind to which RCA said OK! Sound great! Keep in touch! Unlike the controlling Sony, JVC was totally cool with licensing the VHS patents to other companies, and shortly dozens of names would appear on VHS machines. Like this machine, Matsushita made RCAs first Selectavision VCR, and although JVC still warned them about doing so, RCA had Matsushita produce the recorders with an LP, or Long Play, recording mode, which cut the tape speed in half and thus doubled the recording time. RCA thought this was imperative to having a successful product, as 4 hours was a pretty average length for a broadcast football game. And guess what? They were right on the money. As soon as RCA went public in 1977 about their upcoming VCR with this amazing 4 hour recording capability, Sony executives gave a collective AHH! And scrambled to come up with a solution. So what did they do? Well, they just ripped off RCAs technique and introduced a new recorder with the X-2 (later called Beta 2) recording speed. Now, an L-500 tape could hold 2 hours of video, and an L-750 could hold 3. Yay. But thats still not as good as RCAs machine. And now is where things start to get interesting. These two machines reveal the tit-for-tat, look-what-I-can-do nature of the format war in its early stages. RCA kept pushing the importance of recording time, and this machine has the brand new, whiz-bang SLP speed, which allows a whopping 6 hours of recording time on a T-120 tape, 8 hours on the slightly thinner T-160. Sony wouldnt leave this unanswered and released the Beta 3 recording speed, which pushed the L-750 tape to 4.5 hours recording time. Still not that great. So, what did they do? Well, this machine marks the beginning of Sonys desperate attempts to find a way to wow buyers with new exciting features that might let people overlook the shorter recording time. Youll notice this machine proudly proclaims BETASCAN! What does that mean? Well, all video recorders before this very model had to blank the screen when fast-forwarding or rewinding. On this VHS machine, you have to press STOP, wait for the tape to unthread, and then you can fast forward or rewind. And then you press STOP, then PLAY, and hope youre in the right place. But BETASCAN lets you see on the screen a fast-motion image, showing you exactly where you are on the tape! Revolutionary! While this feature would eventually become a staple of the VCR from both Beta machines and VHS models (once VHS manufacturers figured out how to copy Sonys work, which didnt take long), it was at the time kind of a grasping-at-straws gesture. Again, youve got to put yourself in the mindset of consumers at the time. These machines are here to save you from the deep dark despair that consumes you when youve missed your television show! Betascan was more of a neat trick at this point. Whats most important is the machines flexibility at recording shows. And heres where the Sony machine falls flat on its face. OK, were gonna have to pause here. Theres a lot to digest in this format war, so Im going to split it here into two videos. In the next video, well be discussing how Sony seemed to think they could decide what their customers wanted. This led them to a position where they were always a step ahead of VHS in terms of technical feats, but often a step behind when it came to everyday features that people really needed. Thanks for watching! Dont forget to hit that like button and subscribe! As you know, Im doing my best to keep videos like this headed your way. See you next time!",

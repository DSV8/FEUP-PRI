    "transcript": "(phone rings) (upbeat music) - Good morning, I can't quite see yet. It's 5:41, I have to leave in 10 minutes to make it to yoga on time. Does anybody else wear contacts? Has anybody got Lasik surgery? Leave me some comments below. (upbeat music) So early. It's a really nice day today. We survived yoga class and I'm not sure how I'm feeling about this in-screen fingerprint reader. I don't know if it's my finger. Like every time it takes like three tries. Which is kinda frustrating 'cause if I'm trying to open up my screen really quickly it's not, maybe it's a me problem, I'm not sure if this is a universal thing, if anybody else is having issues. So I'm still kind of curating my home screen but right now this is what I've got on it. Instagram, Twitter, Gmail, Spotify, Maps, Facebook, I've got my phone which I don't actually ever talk on the phone and this somehow moved up. So you got the youtube studio, youtube, Snapchat, and Chrome. So I'm gonna make my youtube video live right now. Here it is, this is a massive Oreo unboxing. Alright, video's live. It's been raining so bad outside and we need to take the dog for a walk but I just don't think it's time yet. Oh, boy, we're testing out this water resistance now, in the rain. Look at this wide angle pup. Wide angle. One, two x. Since I left you guys last, I've reset my fingerprint sensor because it's not scanning. I don't know, maybe it's my fingerprint, I'm not sure. But this dog is soaked and he is so disgusting. He smells like rot. Where'd you go? Yeah, get that cone, mark it up. Oh, let's see, we're going this way. So I'm gonna make some breakfast now and I'm gonna use my Samsung to film myself making breakfast. Front-facing video. I can't find a bowl. One of these. As a bowl to mix up some eggs, it's great. Are they spoiled? March six. Today's actually March six so we are in luck. See how this looks. That was good with the zoom, there it is, two x zoom. Filming myself filming the camera. This screen looks really good. (calm music) Play the new Billie Eilish song. I know this is a Samsung video but it's a good song. I haven't even really taken a picture. Ultrawide picture, here's a zoomed in egg picture. And here's a two x zoom. Tried to go live-focus egg. How's that gonna look? Here we go, breakfast is served. - [GPS] Use the left two lanes to turn left onto fourth street. - Okay, okay, cool. This is really riveting content guys. This is the first time that I'm using Google maps on the S10 plus. We are off to get my hair cut. I don't know how much more entertaining I can make this vlog because the weather is trash. I had really big plans for today but instead this is what you're getting. You're getting this beautiful outfit that I have on. This is what I decided to leave the house in. And now I have to live with it. And so do you 'cause you're watching the video. - [GPS] Turn right onto Hollister Avenue. - I want your judgment of me using car play. I need to listen to my music. So here we are, this is the before look. Let's get a zoom in. Let's get a two x zoom in, there we are, wow. I'm just hoping that this video footage looks as good as it does on this screen on other screens 'cause that's one of the dilemmas that I have with Samsung. Is everything looks great on the phone but then when I put it on my computer it doesn't look as good. But this wide angle is so great. Hi. We're doing a camera review today. What do you guys think of the new hair? Basically the same hair, just clean, and cut, and a little bit brighter. I'm basically just using this little segment here to see what it looks like when I'm filming with the back camera and the wide angle. I haven't vlogged in so long, it's like I forgot how to do it. So what's that look like if that's there? I've got you guys here on my dashboard. Look at that, I'm in frame, this looks good. This is actually not bad. A little adjust here. Let's go get some dinner, this jacket is really loud. I hope you guys are really enjoying this video. It's definitely my best work. If this is my best work, we're in trouble. My hair is so clean I don't even know how to act. Play Mike Shinoda. (upbeat music starts) So at dinner and, my gosh, guys. The fingerprint sensor is driving me nuts. It works maybe once every five times. But you have to be so particular and be super precise about it. I don't wanna keep harping on negative things 'cause you guys are just gonna say, just seeing you're an iphone fangirl, obviously you're gonna be complaining. No, it's actually not working. I'm not being crazy, this is, it's not working. The good thing is I'm obsessed with the camera. I'm gonna film a little bit more here. I may have to turn this into a two day testing video 'cause my day is half over. It's not supposed to rain tomorrow, so finger's crossed that I could take this outside and get some sunny shots from a hike. Taking some pictures of my food. (upbeat music) I'm so zoomed in to this butter chicken. I can see the ingredients. I can actually, I can tell you everything that's in it. Here's our one x, and of course the wide angle. I'm so into the wide angle. I really, really like it. The lighting's a little bit lower so. This is a test. I love that they're playing Red Hot Chili Peppers, super into it. Good morning, welcome to day two with the Samsung S10. I would be lying if this was actually day two but this is actually day three. 'Cause yesterday I was busy and didn't get a chance to film anything. But right now I'm gonna go on a hike. Take some photos with this thing but first, I gotta make my oatmeal. And reset the fingerprint. Because I'm still having trouble. Everyone kept giving me suggestions. You're pushing too hard, you're not pushing hard enough, you need to move your finger down, you need to move it up, you need to move it to the side, you need to move it to the left. I I get it. Okay, let's try it out. (upbeat music) Like it really never works on the first try. Another really cool feature on here is their power share so I actually forgot to charge, theoretically, I forgot to charge them. They're charged but for the sake of this demonstration. This is super cool. So you basically slide down on here and this will give a wireless power share option. So when you turn that on this gives you the instructions. It says put the center of your phone back to back with another device. It's now charging. This is pretty cool 'cause I feel like this in an emergency situation where you wanna charge your headphones or you wanna charge something else that is in need of charging. Your friend's phone who may have forgotten to charge it and you don't have another charger. I really like this feature. I think it's super fun and is gonna be something that is probably standard in most phones from now on. Especially if they have an accessory. Like if the iphone could charge my airpods that would be fantastic. Maybe in the next iphone. But for now let's actually go on this hike. The hike is beginning. Wow, it's chilly, it might not look cold. It's sunny but I've got two jackets. This is the Will Rogers state park. This is a really nice hike. It's about two point one mile loop. I forgot to download All Trails on my android phone. How do you use this one? I love this app because it'll show you where you hike. And will keep you on the trail. Shoe ties and everything. (somber music) This is the wide angle rear facing camera. This is the back of the camera, I'm super into the wide angle lens. It's actually really, really cool. It is something that I do wish was on the iphone or I feel like they'll probably implement that this year because it's about time. Okay the hyperlapse looked pretty cool. I wasn't as steady as I probably could've been so I can see how this can be implemented to get some really cool shots. I'll try again. Now we just did a little hike to get some videos and some photos, so far, I'm enjoying the phone a lot. The screen is just, it's so beautiful. It's something that I can't really show you in the video because you just have to see it with your own eyes. It was kinda hard taking pictures in these lighting conditions because the lighting is so harsh. So hopefully some of them turned out okay. Getting some good live focus is interesting because the different live focus backgrounds. Some of them, if you're standing too far away it kind of blurs your body. So if you aren't close enough you're gonna kinda get that effect. (upbeat music) We are back from my day with the S10. It's actually like two days, but it's actually three days, technically. I'm not even sure at this point. But I've really been enjoying this phone and I don't want you guys to think that because the fingerprint sensor isn't working for me very well that that's deterring me from liking this phone overall. I will be doing a follow-up video once I've spent a little more time with it. So I'd say probably my favorite features right now, obviously, I do so much with photos and videos, is the video looks really good. My only complaint, though, is the ultra wide doesn't have image stabilization so you can really tell when you're in that mode. It is a little bit shaky, but man, wide angle looks so great. It is kind of shocking to see some of the stuff. This is from a phone, this looks so good. Look how good this looks. I mean, I'm a little biased, 'cause this is my own video but it's just super smooth. Some of the photos. I will say that some of these background effects they're a little aggressive. I did read a couple comments where people said that the white ceramic looks kind of cheap. You might think that looking at this video 'cause it does kind of have just a basic white look. It kind of looks like plastic in the videos. But when you see this thing up close and actually have it in your hand, it feels a completely different experience. It has a sheen to it, it has this nice finish. It does not look cheap at all. I've also been experimenting with different fingerprint patterns. I'm super happy with this phone. I know I'm IJustine, probably expecting me to say terrible things about it but I really don't have anything bad to say. Other than the fingerprint sensor which is still sort of a new tech. Anyway, this video is probably five hours long at this point. I'm going to end it now, thank you guys for watching, thank you for all of your comments. Let me know what you would like to see in my follow-up video. In the meantime I'm gonna go finish editing this video. And admire all my wonderful photos and videos I got. I'll see you later, bye.

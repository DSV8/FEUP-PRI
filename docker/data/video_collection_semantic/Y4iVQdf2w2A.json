    "transcript": "- Hey, guys. Welcome back to another episode of Riley Checks Out niche quirky tech that is most likely not ready for the mainstream yet. Today, we're taking a look at the Rokid Max, The Max, The Best. I'll tell you what is the best for sure is this box. Look at this cool shifting colors. I've never even seen that before. In case you're wondering what the heck this is, they are AR glasses, if you can call them AR. The definition of AR, VR metaverse devices has changed a lot since people started caring a lot less about the metaverse and more about AI, which is everything But what we have here are basically a new development in the product category of lightweight AR glasses that are mostly actually being used for external displays. We'll get all the way into it, don't you worry. These are very similar to another brand that I've looked at on the channel before, Nreal. There is the Nreal Light and then there was the Nreal Air. I think when you buy the Rokid, it's not gonna come in this fancy packaging like this is the product itself. These are accessories, optional that you can add on. We got a HDMI to USB-C adapter if you don't have a device that has a USB-C output that also supports display over that cable. There's also a Rokid Hub that is kind of a splitter from one USB-C connector to two so that you can use the glasses with a device like your phone or an Nintendo Switch or something and charge your device at the same time so you don't run outta battery. And there's an anti-strip slap which is something I would love to find out what that is. Can we just switch that around and fix that in post? And then you also have maybe the most important accessory. I actually have to unbox this one. Definitely do not buy this thing without this. It's gonna change the game. If we need these, we'll come back to this but for now, say goodbye to the really cool fancy box. Wow. Okay, see you. Now, the Rokid Max itself designed by Rokid in case you were wondering. All right, let's open her up, ey. Ah, man. That's a tight fit. Rokid Max. It comes in a cool little pill case. User manual, (speaking in foreign language). And I could pretend to look through this as if I haven't read it already but I have. The jig's up. And there's also a cleaning cloth, very nice. Okay, let's open her up. Nice. Okay, so there's a cover on top of it. This is the cover shade that you can use to use it more in like a VR mode if you don't wanna see through the actual lenses. And here's the glasses themselves. So the Rokid Max. Oh, interesting. They got some strong flexing going on there with the arms. The overall design here is more along the lines of the Nreal Light, which was the first one released, than the Nreal Air, which kind of like tried to be more of a Wayfair design that like looks like cool glasses. Maybe this sunglass design is cool but I think it looks less cool. I'm sorry. But what the Rokid Max design does have going for it is that it is thinner and lighter. So it's 75 grams. I think that's definitely on the lighter side for this type of product that has been released so far. The other big upgrade that I was excited to try out with these things is the diopter adjustment. With the previous glasses, I was a bit of a weird choice to unbox those products 'cause I have glasses and I need to wear them to see and to survive. But with these, they have built-in diopters so I can take my glasses off, and then use the dial thingies and I can spin the dials and that'll make it so that I can see. Obviously, nothing's happening right now because the glasses aren't on, they're actually not powered. They don't have a battery in them. You have to power them with the USB-C cable. Also in this case, you have the type C cable that has sort of a angled connector on one end and that will plug right into the back of the glasses here. And in we go. Nice. Also in here, we have nose pads. How easy is that to take out? Do you just yank on it? When in doubt, yank it out. Oh there we go. Hmm. We have speakers here on the bottom of the arms so that'll just fire audio directly into your ears. There's no the headphone jack on the actual glasses themselves. Also on the bottom of the arms we have a brightness button. You toggle the brightness, I guess. A volume rocker. And on the inside of that same arm is a proximity sensor so it can tell when to jack you into the metaverse and when to jack you out. As I said, this model is a little bit thinner and lighter than the Nreal ones that I took a look at. We're getting closer to the idea of AR glasses that look like regular sunglasses but maybe the experience and the use cases of this thing will totally outweigh how I look with them on. I guess we'll have to find out after our sponsor. Tired of back pain from prolonged sitting and staring at a screen all day? Yes. Well MotionGrey aims to provide ergonomic workplace solutions at affordable prices and they're located right here in Vancouver with us. Their sit-to-stand desks come in a wide variety of models and sizes, they're simple to assemble and with a bunch of available accessories, you're sure to be able to pick out one to suit your needs. They also have a range of ergonomic chairs available with each one focusing on adjustability, affordability, and providing maximum comfort. So check out MotionGrey at the link below and use code Linus to get 10% off your purchase. It's time to try these babies out. As I said, you can use these glasses with your phone, you can use them with a laptop, console, anything. It's a lot like the NexDock wireless that I did a few videos ago. Now I was first interested in these things based on their ability to be like an AR device where you could move your head around and have things floating in mid-air. And that kind of experience will only be available if you plug into a phone running the Rokid app. Here it says Netflix is even better with Max. And that is actually one of the key differences between this one and other options out there. It has HDCP support so you can stream things from Netflix and other copyright protected services and it should work okay. The main thing that we're interested in going is going to the AR space here, which will put us into Rokid's software experience. It says it's connected. Ooh, all right. So what I see right here is just the screen, the phone mirroring, which will be what you see if you're plugged into anything but a phone running AR mode. I mean right away, before I even get into the software, it's just really nice to be able to take my glasses off and have it be clear 'cause that was one of the biggest barriers to usability with the previous products. - [Bell] That's a Samsung phone. Did you get prompted at all to do DEX? - Thank you for reminding me. This is a Samsung phone so when you connect it to an external display, it'll prompt you to run DEX. This one did not because I got rid of it. The Rokid app actually has a special notice that comes up that says, \"Hey, if you plug this in and you're in DEX mode, just go down and exit DEX mode and then you'll be in our mode.\" So actually it might tell me to do that when I enter right now. So let's try. - Ar mode? - Ar mode. - Is that AR? - AR. Did I say ar? I said our mode but I meant O-U-R like our mode. Not to be confused with ER mode, that's a different one. So the downside of mirroring your phone screen when you're not in an AR mode the screen is tracking wherever I'm looking. It's not like I'm in a 3D space here, is that I want to use my phone but I have to look down at my phone to know where my finger is. Ready? AR mode. Let's go. Our mode is in the middle of the screen. Okay so the mode that we're in right now, I can control this pointer with my thumb on the phone which is now like a touch pad but it's not an AR experience right away. It is in the sense that I can see you guys but now floating wherever I look is the screen. And in this mode, there's no point really in being able to see the real world unless like that's something you wanna do for some reason, you wanted to see through monitor. You do you, I'm not judging, but you might as well like pop these things on if you're not using the actual AR features. Now over here in the settings, I'm going to enable 3D OF, three degrees of freedom which is then going to have the screen floating in place in front of me. It is jiggly as hell. Wow. Yup, that's not great. (chuckles) Oh and now also, my phone is no longer a track pad. My phone is like a Wii pointer. I feel like I need to reset the pointer. So there is a button here that says reset. I'm going to do that. And that didn't really help. (chuckles) It's just kind of like at a weird angle. Oh, so not only can you set your diopters so that you can see without glasses, you can also change the inter pupillary distance for people whose eyes are farther apart or closer together. Example I'm thinking of is Anya Taylor-Joy. She's not gonna watch this video, guys. It's okay. Oh, I can scroll on here. Cool, all right. I completely forgot to say Rokid has a voice command feature where you can tell it to open the application. Okay, so voice control on. Navigate home. I turned it on. Why isn't it working? Most people that I can see buying this type of thing are buying it as what the use case that we're gonna try right after this, which is as a extra display for a device that you're already using such as a laptop, a gaming system. Oh my gosh, I made an avatar. You guys can't see, but look it's me. They didn't have an option for just a mustache without a goatee, so this is what we're dealing with. But hey, I mean, not bad. Good job, Rokid. Oh here we go. Okay, so this is what it was really what I was looking for. I opened the browser and then it brings up an interface that allows me to reposition the app in 3D space. In the Nreal Light, it was pretty cool. In the Nreal Air, they took away the six degrees of freedom. Like you could like lean and it would know what you were doing, but in this one, you don't have head position tracked to AR space basically. You just have the way everywhere you're looking. But as far as it's concerned, you can't move over here and move over here and have that make a difference. You can make the app bigger and if I hold this, I'm making it super far away. I'm making it close up and I can position it. Let's say I'm gonna position it right in front of these guys. I just realized, there's no cameras on this thing. Unlike the Light. The Light had cameras, the Air did not. Okay, so I open up browser and now I have a bunch of apps that I recognize instead of the other apps. But where did those apps go? Can I not have like multiple things open? New page. Oh, okay, so now I have two browser windows. I'm gonna put one there, I'll make another page. And I'll make it a bit bigger and put it right there. Okay, this is what AR people want. I got a browser window here, a browser window here, a browser window here. Now if I connected a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse to my phone, which is possible, maybe I could get some work done in what is probably the most janky work setup that exists ever. Let's go to YouTube. I just wanna see the display quality. And I type there. I type crab rave. Okay, we're full screened here and you know this is an OLED display. Rokid says that it's 1080P, full HD OLED. It looks pretty good. I'm actually pleasantly surprised at the speakers as well. - We can't hear a thing. - You can't hear anything? - Nothing. - Really? Wow. It's like pretty loud to me. I mean not loud, but it's like... - [Mark] No, I can't hear anything. - Okay, I'm gonna turn it up. Oh right, this is max volume and I can turn it down. (faint lively music) - [Mark] Huh. - And even though I did that whole thing, I put them back on and everything's back where it was. It might be a bit to the right, I'm not sure. So yeah, it's a pretty decent viewing experience in AR. The colors look nice, it's sharp, it's got a 1080P panel. Sorry that's micro OLED, not just regular OLED, but we're way past that. The other key thing here is that it's 120 hertz display and I can say that when I move around, things are pretty jiggly but for the most part, it seems like that's because of the sensors trying to keep up with where my head is at and not the display refresh rate itself. The display refresh rate looks pretty smooth when I'm moving things around. So this is pretty cool for an AR floating windows, expandable desktop working situation but it's limited to your phone, which is pretty lame. So let's plug it into a gaming system. This is my Ayaneo Pro from 2021. I'm gonna plug it in to one of these USB-C board ports. Settings came up. It's very bright. I forgot to mention this thing has 600 nits of brightness which is quite a bit for something that's meant to go right on your face. But I guess they were thinking that if you're gonna use this outside, you definitely wanna see what you are looking at. Let's get in a game and then I can talk about that real quick. My issue when using this thing not in AR mode is that however you move your head, the screen goes with you which you'd think is not a problem, as long as you like have your head in one place. I know that when I plugged this in to my laptop and I was trying to do some work on it, I realized that when I'm looking at a computer screen, I move my head up to look at the URL bar or I move my head down to look at the bottom part of the screen. And when I do that, the screen moves with me. One thing that I completely forgot to mention is the fact that the brightness button doubles as a switch to go back and forth between 2D and 3D mode. So I'm gonna do that right now and see what happens. That's not good. Oof. My left eye is seeing exactly half of the image and my right eye is seeing exactly the right half of the image. So there's no way. In order to make that 3D, and I have to cross my eyes all the way. Well, my verdict on the 3D mode is that there's something wrong with it and they need to fix it or I need to fix it. Regardless, I mean, the AR aspect of having things float in space is there. So I don't know if that's necessary or not to have the actual realistic AR floating thing. But it works for me even when I'm not in quote unquote \"3D mode.\" So pretty cool. I can see this being a compelling experience. It's definitely a sharper situation to be looking at a full 1080P 120 hertz OLED display. I can see way more of this game than I could looking at the device itself. So I can definitely see the appeal of throwing these in your bag and taking it with you on a trip or something. Okay. So overall, there are some interesting improvements in this sphere of tech product. The current trend is to get rid of the battery in the device itself and just have it used as an external display thing for either your phone or another device, which, it's actually pretty okay. I'm fine with that. What I'm not fine with is selling these as AR glasses and then having a AR experience that is still very disappointing. I mean, I didn't even take a look at the AR games and stuff that are within their platform. They have a number of games that you can check out, but oh, you have holographic people on your table. We've had that for years and I don't think that's really impressing anybody anymore. What I would really, really, really love to see is a brand like Rokid and Nreal work with Samsung or Huawei or Motorola. These companies that have desktop versions of their phone operating system to allow you to take your phone to the cafe and you have your little Bluetooth keyboard and maybe a mouse and you connect it all together and now you got floating windows, multiple browsers and you're looking around with this like virtual multi-monitor setup. Just basically having a phone with this and a keyboard and a mouse. Maybe that's stupid because you can have all of that in the same package as a laptop basically. I'm an optimist and I'm an idealist. I wanna see cool things happen out there in the world of technology. So this is definitely cool. Definitely progress, Rokid, thanks for sending them over but not quite ready yet. Just keep going, keep going. Shoot for the stars. It's $439. Apparently, it marks down from $599. Is something like this worth that much? Basically, no. It's too expensive. But if they get enough early adopters continuing to try this stuff out and release more versions that don't look as dorky as this sunglass design and have more of an AR experience that people actually are going to be interested in and use, they can maybe release a product that's not as expensive. And that's what I wanna see and I am glad to see that you finished this video. Good job. (laughs) If you're looking for something else to watch and you need the context for this whole video, go watch the Nreal video I did recently and see you there.",

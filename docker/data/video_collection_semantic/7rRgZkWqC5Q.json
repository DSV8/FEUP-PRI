    "transcript": "- Today on \"Mystery Tech,\" we are going to be experiencing the greatest joys of the holiday season with all of my favorite people. - [Ken] And have your paid family come out and enjoy Christmas with you? - We had to come in on a Saturday for this. - To celebrate the season, the entire crew has pitched in to pick one \"Mystery Tech\" item each, and like I did for the birthday episode, I've gotta determine who has actually gotten me what. I mean, gotten \"Mystery Tech.\" It's for us, right? We're all sharing it. It's part of the experience. - [Matt] I have a feeling you're gonna get all this wrong, 'cause you did that last time. - All right, let us begin the holiday festivities. - [Ken] Oh, that's funny. - [Josh] Oh my God. (all laugh) - Someone took a bunch of photos of me, (Austin laughs) and now I've got to rip my face open to determine what this is. Flying Santa! What? It's a Santa drone. - Oh? So if you've watched \"Mystery Tech\" in the past, you'll know that I have a little bit of a history with drones, mostly flying 'em in the studio and inevitably crashing them, like literally every time. So what could go possibly wrong with an audience full of willing meat bags? I mean, participants. - [Jared] Oh my God. - So the only problem with these drones usually is that they come with no charge. I'm not gonna read the instructions. Do you just? Oh, you literally just punch it out, huh? Oh, you have to literally punch it in the side of Rudolph. This doesn't have batteries, does it? I bet this doesn't have batteries. - [Matt] How long have you been doing this? 'Cause I feel like you're getting worse at it. - I don't need commentary the here. I'm trying to figure it out. - [Matt] You literally brought us in for the commentary. (drone beeps) - [Austin] I'm assuming that. (crew cheers) Oh, Jesus Christ, okay. - Okay, it works! Merry Christmas! - [Matt] He's drifting. (Austin laughs) - Oh, it's, that's all the power it's got. I think Santa needs a little time for some R&R with Mrs. Claus. We'll bring Santa Claus back in 40 to 50 minutes when he is done charging. All right, lay it on me, my friends. That is a large photo of my face. - [Matt] I've had nightmares about that exact image. - Where's the verified sticker? (Matt groans) (all laugh) - Why is it life sized? - [Ken] It is life size. It's kinda crazy. (all laugh) - [Matt] Oh no. - We also have the mobile retro handmade game controller, designed in Korea Wait. Oh my God, that's adorable. Is this meant to go on a phone? - [Ken] Gee, I wonder what phone it could go on? - Does it go on the Z Flip? - [Ken] Wow, it only took him like. - Is this how I'm supposed to do it? It fits. So basically what it does is on the inside of the controller, it just essentially just maps all these buttons to this little bit of like mesh, which I assume is just like positive touch. Theoretically, this would work with pretty much any game that you can actually move the buttons around, but really seems like it's meant for like an emulator or something like that. Basically, what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to take the touch controls and line them up as closely as possible. So the start works. Yo, wait, does the, yep, up and down works! Look at that! Look at that! This totally works! This is dope. This is really, really cool. And honestly, it solves the only real problem I have with playing Game Boy games on my Z Flip, which is just the fact that I don't have physical controls. I'm gonna attempt to play with the DDR pad. (electronic music) - [Ken] You know you don't use your hips for DDR. - Yeah, you do. - Yeah, you do. - All right, here we go. Up, right, right, left, left. - Don't do that motion towards your employees. (all laugh) - Oh, that one, that one, that one. (all laugh) - Christmas! That was lovely and wonderful. So who got the Retroid Z Flip game accessories? I'm gonna look at everyone in the eye and see who's lying to me. (all laugh) - The double pain. - My guess, - Educated guess? Rio. - Damn! - It was not. - [Austin] Matt? - Yeah! - Whoa! - Oh my god! - [Josh] Let's go! - I did not actually pick this out for you. Jake Simmons did. - Oh, thank you, Jake. Excellent choice. - I just stole it for my idea, so I didn't have to look for anything. - Checks out. It checks out. Okay, so. (all laugh) - Can you hold that up next to your face? - Where did this come from? - So, if you wanna know, I'm the one who bought all the wrapping paper, and I just typed Austin Evans in Google and downloaded all of the top images. - All right. I'm gonna throw- - [Crew] Whoa. - Whoa! - Careful. - What is this? This is so over the top in the wrapping. \"Jared, thanks for the order! (all laugh) \"Please leave an Etsy shop review.\" Score one for Austin, baby! Let's go! - Can you get shot of Jared? Jared's turning so red right now. (all laugh) Oh, that's cool! That's cool. It's like a wood cutout of Monaco. - [Ken] It's a wood cutout of a boring track. - I can almost see where, almost see where Checo- - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. So this is really cool. So essentially, if you're not familiar, Monaco is a tiny, tiny little country in the south of France, even though it's not technically in France, where it is essentially the home of Formula 1, right? This is the most famous Grand Prix, and while it's maybe not the most exciting race to watch, it is like the crown jewel of Formula 1. It's super cool. I've always wanted to go to Monaco. Let me guess, who got this? Jared! - [Jared] And you're wrong! I ordered it. That doesn't mean- - What? - No way! (all laugh) - Ken? - [Ken] Nope. - Karen? - No. - [Austin] Josh? - Nope. - [Jared] You'll get there. - Griffin? - No. - [Austin] Oh my God. Kenzie? - No. - It was the person that got you a Formula 1 thing last time, correct? - Hey, Aron! - No, I didn't. - [Austin] What? Rio? (bright music) - [Austin] Literally, the last person. (all laugh) - [Jared] You literally skipped over her! - Yeah, you literally skipped over me. I was like, \"What? (all laugh) - [Austin] Thanks, Rio. - You're welcome. - This is gonna go? Does that look good? - [Ken] That's not centered, but it's fine. - [Joanna] The set is no longer symmetrical. - [Ken] No, wait, wait, wait. Yes. That side. That side. - Why? Why this side? Oh, okay, this is a violation. - [Ken] Those are the good old days. - [Jared] Hold on, hold on. - So the fact that Ken knows this one's supposed to be face up makes it highly suspicious. - Interesting. - Highly suspicious. Wait, this is an Xbox controller? The Elite Series 2? How did you know that that was supposed to face up? - [Ken] I didn't. - Nibbler! Hey! - [Kinsey] So cool of Nibbler to be here on a Saturday. - Yeah. It's his day off. - So this is the Elite Series 2. This is a control that's been out for a little bit. - You sound ungrateful. Wow. - Yeah. - Jesus. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hold on. See- - [Matt] This is last year's model. - [Austin] Oh, it's Design Lab. - [Matt] Maybe if you had looked at the box before complaining. - I was bringing up a legitimate question. I'm afraid of what this one's gonna look like. Denki Channel? - Merry Christmas! Those are all of the Denki colors plus some- - Other colors. - Creative. - [Austin] Wonder who picked this one? - Subscribe. We're almost at a hundred thousand. - What a holiday miracle. A Ken shout out in a \"Mystery Tech\" episode. I've never seen this before in my life. Nibbler, don't do it. Don't do it buddy. (crew laughs) - [Ken] Nibbler, now's your chance. Oh, he's just chilling there. - Everyone, I would just say I have been certified by the SAA, the Santa Air Administration, for this particular flight. (drone buzzes) Okay, we're up in the air. Ho, ho, ho. I can't turn left or right. Oh, I hope Santa has Geico. How about this? I fly it into the person who I think got it for me? - [Jared] Oh God. - [Austin] Nice. Now hold. I gotta stabilize, I gotta stabilize. - Are you? (crew cheers) - It's Joanna. - Joanna! - [Joanna] No! - There is- - No? - It's not Joanna? (drone buzzes) No, no, no. Return it to the wild. (Aron laughs) - [Matt] It's Joanna again! - [Joanna] It's still not me. - I was just double checking. I was just double checking. (drone buzzes) Griffin! - [Griffin] Yes. Actually, yes. (Austin cheers) - Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas. That's soft. Let's take a look. What's in this giant burrito? - [Griffin] A fish. - A fish? Sorry, did you say a fish? I'm gonna whack you with a fish. Does it feel like a fish? - All right, we've got- - Oh. - Oh no. Oh no, no! It's something for me to wear. I'm gonna do this. Can I? I'm gonna try something I've never done before. I'm gonna go in the bathroom, take off all my clothes blindfolded, put on all these clothes without looking, and then step out. - What? Is this, if I have two legs in one pant hole, you'll know why. I'll be right back. - [Matt] I don't like any of this. - [Rio] Bye. - I think I got everything on. Is everyone ready for the reveal? - [Matt] Yeah, we know what it is, so like. - [Austin] Hello. - [Mat] Wow. - I'm still not gonna look. What does everyone think? - Whoa! - It's wonderful. - It is, whoa. - I'm a big fan. - [Josh] Ready to go fast? - You like Big Red? - Is this Ricky? It's Ricky Bobby! (Austin laughs) - [Ken] It's like wish.com. It's like wish.com Ricky Bobby though, 'cause all the logos are just slightly altered, so it's not breaking copyrights. - SundCo! (crew laughs) - [Ken] PowerAde 8k. (Ken laughs) - This is very breezy fabric. I'm feeling a little chilly. - [Matt] Is it flame resistant by any stretch? - [Ken] Do you wanna find out? - Invisible fire got me! Help me, Tom Cruise. Whoever picked this clearly knows me well. \"Talladega Nights: the Ballad of Ricky Bobby\" is one of the greatest movies of all time. Now we're gonna obviously wear this for the rest of the episode, but who knows me well enough to know that I love Ricky Bobby? So Ken knows I love Ricky Bobby. I think Matt knows. - I definitely know. Karen knows, but she doesn't like the movie, so she probably wouldn't have picked it. - [Ken] What? - Josh, do you like Ricky Bobby? - I've never seen Ricky Bobby. - You can't ask questions like- - Josh! (Matt sighs) (all laugh) - [Austin] Authentically not Josh. - Show of hands. Who has not seen Ricky Bobby in this room? - I've still only seen- - \"Mystery Tech\" is canceled. - We're gonna go watch the movie. - Look, if you ain't first or last, I'm gonna call Karen the Cougar on you. - What? - What? - There's a cougar called Karen in the movie. (all laugh) You'll get there one day. It's okay. (Josh laughs) All right, now I'm sleeping on the couch tonight, I'm gonna guess- - [Matt] Austin is sleeping on the couch tonight. - No. I'm gonna come home, and my best friend's gonna be married to my wife! It's gonna be terrible! (all laugh) I'm gonna say Aaron. - No. - You didn't pick it? Ugh! - You suck at this. - Jared. - No. - [Jared] Dude, Austin, you got- - [Austin] Josh? - Hey! I threw you off! I'm the guy who hasn't seen the movie. You would never guess me if I picked this. - Have you seen this movie? - I literally have never seen it. - Josh. - How did you know it then? - I've been with you for four and a half years. I'm, come on. - Oh, that's true. - [Jared] That's true. - [Josh] Come on. - I'm so. - Let's go. Hit me, my good friend. Oh, it's a little guy. All right. Merry Christmas, huh? A'ight. - Whoa. Merry Christmas to me. - Whoa. (Matt laughs) Thanks for giving me this wonderful. (all laugh) All right, so this is the 8 Bit Xmas 2021. I don't know exactly what this is, but it's obviously an NES cartridge. I'm assuming that it is a new NES game that someone has created that is very Christmassy, and it's from Retro USB. So we're gonna play some 8 Bit Xmas Duck Race. Hey, let's go. This is cool. So I know that a lot of consoles still have a very avid community who are developing like home brew titles for them. - [Matt] Look, it's got LEDs. - [Jared] Oh, oh, that's sick. - [Joanna] It's got Christmas. - Oh wow. We're just in it. Okay. It's really hard to keep track of which one is which. But I'm Yellow Duck, I think. - [Jared] I think you're in last place, actually. - No, I'm not. (crew laughs) Wait, did I finish? (victorious music) - [Josh] Popping wheelies. - I was gonna say, if you ain't first, you're last, so I was last. Who would've chosen 8 Bit Xmas for the NES? I actually think I know this one. Jared. - [Jared] Nope. You're really good at this. - [Matt] It was actually Nibbler. - Nibbler. Kenzie. - Yeah. (all cheer) - [Austin] My second choice. - I found out about this when I was researching the Weird Cartridges video. - Oh! - And I was like, - [Kenzie] \"Wait, that'd actually be really good \"for Chris-\"Mystery Tech.\"\" - That's good. For the record, I did not know it would come with that card. - I didn't do that. - Thanks, I appreciate it. Ooh, that's a lumpy one. That's a lumpy one. All right, well, just like this very happy photo of me, Nibbler, do you know what this is? What is this? Can you help me? Oh, look, he sniffs it too. I like him. - [Matt] Don't come compare yourself to a dog. (dog barks) - It's the Spider-Man dinosaur. - [Ken] Ah! - Can I just point out that Roboraptor has been festively dressed for the occasion? He is prepared and ready to unleash his absolute fury. - Does he have pants? - It looks- (all laugh) (Roboraptor crashes) (all groan) - [Rio] I can't believe that happened. - That sounded bad. The fact that he's not squirming, that might have been the last one. That neck does not look great. - [Jared] Austin is like, \"I treat Roboraptor like my son.\" (crew laughs) - [Matt] It's all gone. He's all done. (crew cheers) - [Griffin] Nice. - So do I just open his mouth? Look at, look at that. Look at that. Beat him up! Get him, Roboraptor! - [Ken] Do both. (crew groans) - Oh, Jesus. So who got the clearly inferior dinosaur? I'm gonna say, - Don't look at me. Aaron. - No. - [Josh] Oh my God. - Joanna? - [Joanna] No. - Jared? - [Jared] Yeah. (all laugh) - Jared, what was, why would you choose? Why? Why? We already have Roboraptor. Why would- - [Jared] I thought he needed a friend. - With a 33.3% chance of getting this next one correct, what could possibly go wrong? Well, it's a pillow. (crew laughs) - [Jared] Does it smell like China? - Well, hang on, let me actually do the real test here. - [Matt] Are you spooning yourself? - Yep. Who would've chosen the Austin Charmander? Because this is a gift that requires some real thought on putting my face on a Charmander. (all laugh) So Joanna is left, Aaron is left, and Karen is left. So, which one of the three of you would've chosen? I think I know. Karen. - No. - Oh my god. You are so- - No? - You think Karen would even let you take that home? Who would have a PNG of your head? - [Austin] Aaron? - No. I do have- - What? - Joanna? - [Aaron] Pics of your head, though. - [Joanna] Internet's a wonderful place. - Okay. This is very small. I'm very amused. - You know, some people might call that large. It's pretty big, actually. - Wait, wait, wait. Are those the divorce papers or? - [Ken] Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey! - Way to give it away! - Okay, well, I'm gonna open this up now. \"Mystery Tech\" today took such a turn. All right, let's take a look. Let's take a look here. We've got ourselves TinyCircuit. Ooh, what? Thumby. (all laugh) - Oh no. - I don't like where this is going. Thumby, the playable programmable key chain. This is, I think, the smallest item we've ever had on \"Mystery Tech.\" - [Josh] I beg to differ. - What's been smaller than this? - [Jared] Yeah. You didn't want to ask that question. - Yeah, it actually, that's pretty average, actually. That's pretty normal size. - You know, it's the holiday season, and y'all all need Jesus, okay? I'm gonna fire up my Thumby. This could be almost impossible to see on camera. You just should stand on the table and hold it up to C camera. - Yes. I will say A cam is not the most. (all laugh) - [Ken] Wait, wait, wait, wait. - [Josh] Oh, there you go. There you go. - All right. I'm gonna play Thumgeon. Oh wow, that is even smaller. What am I doing? Oh, I've gotta like escape the dungeon. - [Jared] You mean the thumgeon? - Oh, I'm del, a wizard killed me already. - What? I will say, this is like I'm getting carpal tunnel as we speak. - See, it is true. - It's brilliant. - [Ken] It's awesome. - Who would've chosen the Thumby? It is literally between Aaron and Karen. I'm gonna say Aaron. - It was me. - Yes, I got it! - As a fellow small-handed king, the Game Boy is a little too big, so I needed something. - This is actually legitimately cool though. So there is, by my estimation, one item remaining. Now- - You get this one wrong. (all laugh) - Last time, Karen also had the last item, and it was quite the item. So I look forward to this, and hope that I do not get demonetized. Jared, if you would be so kind. Oh no. The fact that you have to gently- (crew members laugh) - [Jared] I just don't want it to go off early, so. (crew members laugh) - You know we could get demonetized, right? - Then we're all sleeping on the couch. - [Austin] I'm terrified. This is gonna be something bad. - Why? (all laugh) - Let's not get canceled for Christmas. It's in an Amazon Prime bag. That's a good sign. (Austin sniffs) (all laugh) Why does it smell like farts? - [Jared] She knew your instinct right away. - You guys smell this? - No. - No. - [Aaron] Prefer not to. (all protest) - I'm really afraid right now. Tootles Underwear! - [Josh] Yes. (Karen laughs) - Silent but deadly, now just silent. These are fart removing underwear. (all laugh) Do we need to have a discussion? Do you need to say anything to me right now? - Just put them on! (all laugh) - [Ken] She's like, \"Shh, I'm done.\" - [Aaron] She's desperate, man. - [Ken] Today's the day. - This is fart spray. Thanks for, we can can test it with fart spray instead of real fart. (crew laughs) So, I mean, these just look like, actually they feel nice. It's boxers. They got Tootles all, but I think- (crew laughs) - [Joanna] Could you imagine going out on a date? You know you're getting down to business at the end of the night. - No, you're prepared. You're prepared. Jared, you don't wanna fart and someone smelled it. So I'm trying to determine what's going on here. Oh, so it's bamboo, cotton, spandex, and activated carbon liner. - Oh, what the? - Okay. - It'll be activated, all right. - How am I supposed to test with this fart spray? - [Jared] You were gonna hold that right to your face. You're just gonna go (Jared imitates spritzing) - [Matt] So put it on your head. - You love smelling things, so why is this so difficult? - Karen, can you please assist with the testing of this? - Hey! - All right. (all laugh) - All right, how are we doing this? - [Matt] How often do you get to spray your husband in the face with fart spray? - Wait, wait, wait. Am I supposed to do it? - [Matt] Yes! - In the face? - [Matt] Yes! - You know, people used to respect me, okay? It was a long time ago, but people used to respect me. - Real quick, did anyone notice that the 10% off code that's on the test there says, \"I tooted.\" (all laugh) - Spray me. - I feel really bad. (all laugh) - This is the part you feel bad? You bought this for me. - All right. (bottle spritzes) (all exclaim) That don't work! That don't work! That's bad! (bottle spritzes) (Austin groans) That don't work! That don't work! - [Ken] Wow. This is, (Austin coughs) (crew laughs) this is literally a shady, awkward situation right here. - What kinda farts are you, do you think I'm laying in these? Why did you hit me with so many spritzes? - [Matt] She did it like 15 times. - [Rio] See the first three- - [Ken] She really wanted to know the answer, Austin. - And we're gonna definitely get out of this studio right now. Oh my God. It's, this is never gonna get out. - This is really bad. - Oh God. - Oh, it's so bad. - Oh god. (drone buzzes) - Oh, dude, it's so bad. - That was awful. That was awful. - [Austin] Dude, I'm like actually gagging.",

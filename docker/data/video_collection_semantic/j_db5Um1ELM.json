    "transcript": "- Hey guys, this is how not to win the lottery. Now, we've all, I'm sure, been tempted, by those massive jackpots. I mean, come on, who doesn't wanna win $1.6 billion? To give some context on just how big the lottery is, here in the United States alone last year, over $80 billion was spent to which is equal to over $250 for every man, woman, and child in the entire United States of America. This is more than every other form of entertainment in the United States combined. Video games, $13 billon last year. How about sport and concerts? 11 billion. Movies, also $11 billion. The lottery is a big business. However, like any form of gambling there are always those who want to take advantage of the system. These can be everything from people making fake tickets, to cashiers just deciding to keep that winning ticket to themselves. In 1980, a scandal broke out in the Pennsylvania state lottery, which was quickly known as the triple six fix. Or six, six, six if you wanna be edgy. Nick Perry teamed up with Peter and Jack Maragos to fix the daily number game. Perry was the announcer for the TV station that drew the numbers, WTAE in Pittsburgh. To game the system, the trio approached the art director for the station, Joseph Bach, to create weighted replicas of the balls. Very clever. Okay, this is like the scene from Better Call Saul, where he did the same thing, he squirted the ink inside the balls. The con was simple. The weighted balls were too heavy to be pickup by the machine, so only the non-weighted balls would be drawn, thus almost guaranteeing a win. Bach, just like our friend Jimmy McGill, injected the balls with a little bit of latex paint, which added just enough weight to mean that they would not be able to be picked up by the machine, thus almost guaranteeing that the non-weighted balls would be selected for the winner. It did guarantee it, because it worked. To avoid detection, Perry and his crew, being the criminal masterminds that they were, decided that instead of weighing down nine of the 10 balls and thus getting a one, one, one number, which sounds a little suspicious, instead they would weigh down all but two balls. Which every ball weighted besides four and six, they guaranteed that they would get only one of eight different draws. Four, four, four. Four, four, six. Four, six, six. Six, six, six. Six, four, four. Six, four, six. Six, four, six. (low failure buzzer) And four, six, four? (high ding) - Yeah! - Did I get it right? - [Matt] I think so. - I think I missed one, didn't I? What the meant is the crew only needed to buy eight combinations of numbers to be guaranteed to win. Making the scheme even more nefarious, is that a different local senior citizen was selected each week to the draw. Which meant that they weren't really familiar with the weight of the balls. As you might imagine, the plan worked perfectly. On April 24th, 1980, on live television, the number six, six, six was drawn on a record $3.5 million jackpot. No one spotted any evidence of tampering during the draw, but the day before more than just a little bit of suspicion was roused by the Maragos brothers. These bright fellows went from place to place, consistently buying lots of tickets with just the eight numbers that were guaranteed to win. You know, because staying under the radar is important when you're doing lottery scams. They entire scheme was brought down by a single anonymous tip from a bar owner, who saw someone arguing in Greek over payphone. Then they held the phone up to the lottery machine, to prove that the tickets were actually being purchased. That's not suspicious or anything. The police, or the lotto police if that's a thing, traced the call back to the TV station, which very quickly connected the Maragos brothers with he only other Greek speaking person there, Nick Perry. Since then lottery systems have largely moved away from things like ping-pong balls, over to all digital systems. Which as I'm sure, will be a surprise to exactly no one, have also been targeted. In 2016, Eddie Tipton, the Information Security Director of the Multi-State Lottery Association, and boy is that a mouth full, got arrested for tampering with the Iowa state lottery. This was not a story of a super leet hack-saur who worked his way into the main frame. Instead he just used his influence to get access to the main system and then he used a root kit to just change the code on the main lottery computer. This root kit he installed was actually very clever. It only changed a small part of the code, which was never actually properly audited. Essentially what it allows you to do, was to guarantee the outcome of a draw on very rare occasions, say every year and a half. This scheme worked surprisingly well for years. Right up until the point where Eddie Tipton walked into a store and purchased a lottery ticket himself, which is actually highly illegal, as obviously someone who works for the lottery commission shouldn't be able to purchase lottery tickets. That's not a good idea. And thus, he was caught. And one of the really crazy parts of this entire story was when they started to do the research, he'd given winning tickets and winning numbers to many friends and family members over the years, which had made millions and millions of dollars off of that lottery. During the investigation it was discovered that Tipton had been running his scams in multiple states since all the way back in 2005. If being a criminal isn't your thing, what about trying to win the lottery legally? By that what happens when you have lots and lots of money and you want to risk it on what is probably a terrible, terrible investment? So if you're like Matt, you're probably not into being a criminal, I hope. But you might be interested in trying to find a way to win the lottery legally, besides buying a ticket every week and hoping you finally win something. 'Cause that's lame. Do a quick Google for this, and you'll find that there's an incredibly popular strategy, just buy every single ticket. - Literally you actually can't lose. - When it comes to a huge jackpot like the $1.6 billion that was recently won, that would leave you a cool, $1 billion of profit, before taxes of course. In 1992, an Australian investment firm decided to buy every single possible combination of the Virginia lotto jackpot. With only 7 million combinations at $1 each, for a $24 million payout, it's actually a fairly obtainable goal. The problem with this strategy is that there's only a limited about of time to buy tickets before the next drawing. And the investment company in this case was only able to buy 5 million of the overall 7 million combinations. Even without every possible ticket, the Australian firm actually did win their lottery, netting them a cool quadrupling of their profits over 20 years. So you know, not bad. Move over to the Mega Millions and that is where the math very quickly turns against you. Assuming you were able to buy a ticket every second, and spoiler alert, you can't. It would take you nine and a half years to purchase every single combination. Since there are only 96 hours between draws with the Mega Millions, that means that realistically you instead have to buy 976 tickets every single second, for 96 hours straight. So unless you're MrBeast, that's probably not gonna happen. This strategy also completely relies on having no other winners in the jackpot. Even though it's fairly rare, it definitely does happen sometimes where multiple people will have those same numbers and have to split the jackpot. Even with the recent record breaking $1.6 billion jackpot, if you have to split it with even a single other person, you're going to lose millions and millions of dollars, largely thanks to the taxes. Let's do the math on this, shall we? So we start out with a $1.6 billion jackpot, which when you cut it in half brings you down to $800 million. Then you have to subtract 40% roughly for the actual taxes then giving you a total of $480 million. Now once you consider that you spent $605 million on tickets you have a negative of $125 million. That' not a lot of return on your 700 plus ticket per second weekend. Yes my friends, you will be losing $125 million by winning the lottery. So you know, probably don't do that. So that my friends is how not to win the lottery.

No if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go not play the lottery.",

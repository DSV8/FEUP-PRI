    "transcript": "- What does it look like I'm doing? Perhaps I'm checking my email. Perhaps I'm just looking at a website on the internet. Well, in actual fact what I'm using is a pine phone and I'm cracking wifi networks using wifite on this phone. I can use various applications, airmon-ng on this example wifite to discover wifi networks and then crack wifi networks using this pine phone. (upbeat music) Now this video is for educational purposes only. The wifi network that I'm gonna be attacking is this wifi network behind me. I own the infrastructure, I own this phone. I just wanna demonstrate that a phone such as this running Linux can run applications such as wifite and others to crack wifi networks. Now, in this video I'm showing you how to set up the phone from scratch. So from unboxing to being able to do this. So if you're not interested, for example in seeing the unboxing and you just wanna see the software that needs to be installed to get this to work then use the timestamps below. (upbeat music) I'll open the device. Very simple packaging on this device, takes a bit of effort to open the box. There we go. So phone construction, manual cover. The actual phone itself. That's broken, which is interesting. Got a cable, so Linux phone. - Nice. - Now we're told in the instructions that we have to open this up pry this open with our fingers or something else? There we go. Gotta take the battery out. So I gotta take this plastic off the battery. So I'll remove that and I should be able to plug in the battery. Now my main objective here is to get it booted with Linux and then to see if I can get a wifi adapter connected to this or do other things in Linux that you can't necessarily do on an Android phone unless you root it. Okay, you can see it's booting up. Welcome screen appears. Okay so I'm in the UK so I'll specify London as my time zone. It's trying to find wifi network so I'll connect it to a wifi network and I'll press connect. And there you go. I've got Linux running on my phone. Most important thing, because this is Linux is I want to open up a terminal. So on the phone I could use a command such as IP address to see the IP address of the phone. It's got an address of 192, 168 30.18. So from my Mac, I'm gonna SSH to that IP address 192, 168 30.18, and I can put in my password. And as you can see there, I'm connected to Manjaro arm. Okay, so now that I've shown you the initial configuration of the phone, let's look at the software that needs to be installed to get wifite working. Now you don't have to use wifite you could use on airmon-ng, installing wifite however is good because it installs a whole bunch of extra tools. Like as an example IF config doesn't work outta the box on this phone. IW config doesn't work. It's not installed on the default operating system. So what I've done is I've put a list of commands below and I'll demonstrate them here that shows you how to set this up. So the first thing I did was install open SSH so that I could SSH to the phone. This phone is running Linux. You could install different versions of Linux but in this case, because we are using Manjaro we are going to use these commands to install open ssh. So pseudo Pacman dash S open SSH to install open SSH we're gonna use pseudo system CTL enable SSH service. To enable the service, we're gonna start the service and then you can verify it using this command. So I've used those commands previously to get SSH running onto this phone. So if I just type the verify command, put my password in you can see that the service is running and I just use queue to quit there. So I've already SSH'd to the phone. And what I can do is use this command to update packages. So pseudo Pacman dash SYU it's checked if everything's up to date. As you can see, nothing needs to be installed. And then I can install wifite. So I'll clear the screen and I'll paste that command in. Now I'm gonna install wifite here. Actually, what happens when you do this for the first time is it's not just gonna install wifite it's gonna install a whole bunch of other packages. It's gonna install the software required to run commands such as IF config, IW config, airmon-ng, other commands. So as an example Airmon-ng, works here because when you install wifite it actually installs that for you as a prerequisite. Makes it much easier than try and install all the packages. So I'd recommend installing wifite, even if you didn't want to use the wifite application because it installs a whole bunch of other necessary stuff. For wifite to work you need to install other software such as wire shock. So in this example, I won't reinstall Wire Shock but you've gotta install Wire Shark you've gotta install Hgx tools you've gotta install HCX Dump Tool you've gotta install Reva, you've gotta install Cow Patty. If you don't install that software it's not gonna work properly. Wifite also requires Pirate. So to install that, you need to install gcc. Then you need to install Git, then you need to clone the pirate software from GitHub and to go into the pirate directory, set it up with a clean install build it, and then install it. Now, if Python is not installed, you'll have to install Python as well. So if I look at my history and then I grep for Python this is the command that I used to install Python version two, so I'll add that there. You need to have Python two with this version of wifite. So make sure that you install Python two and then you can use Python to install the pirate software. Now the dictionary is installed in this directory. So if you wanna look at the dictionary the probable dictionary, the one that's used by default that is the dictionary of passwords that are used. You could use a different dictionary if you wanted to. So you could use RockYou as an example, but that's the one that's used by default, and that's why I set this password to Spider-Man. - You're the Spider-man. - I'm not, I'm not - Because by default, Spider-Man is in the list of probable passwords and a whole bunch of other Spider-Man iterations. (upbeat music) And then I'll type the command pseudo wifite to run the wifite hacking tool directly on the phone. Now we told that there are two wifi adapters W land zero and W Land one. Here's our RT 2,800 usb. Now I'm SSHing from my Mac to the phone. This is the wifi adapter that I'm gonna use to attack the wifi network. So I'm gonna use two as an option here. It's enabling monitor mode. On the wifi adapter you need to use a wifi adapter that supports monitor mode. This one does supports both monitor and injection mode. And what you'll notice there is it's picked up a bunch of wifi networks. Now I'll press control C to stop the application searching for wifi devices. As you can see here this TP link network has two clients connected to it. So this little network has two clients. One of them is the Windows laptop. Over here, if I look at the window settings you can see that it's connected to that network. The other device should be this phone. So if I go to the wifi settings on this phone it's also connected to the same wifi network. And what that allows me to do is it allows me to kick off clients and capture the handshake if necessary. So what I'm gonna do is select one to attack that wifi network. And as you can see, it's now running a pixie dust attack. Various attacks can be run. This one will take about five minutes and then it's gonna try a null pin attack. In this case, Reva stopped the process. It's then gonna try a WPS pin attack that was locked by the access point. So that failed. It's gonna try a PMK ID attack in this example. I'm gonna stop that as well and press C to continue. And what it's gonna try and do now is try and capture the handshake. It's already done that. And then now what it's trying to do is it's trying to crack the password. Okay, so there you go. It captured the handshake and then it broke the wifi password. Now this example, it's using the wordless probable text file and the password that I configured on this wifi network is Spider-Man. - No, I'm not Spider-Man. - I mean, I've been watching you for like a while now it's kind of obvious - That's a very easy one to crack. Hopefully you're not using a password like that on your wifi network. May this be a warning to you that someone could use a phone like this and a little wifi adapter and they could capture the handshake between your client devices and your access point and then crack that. Now they're probably not going to do it this way. They're probably going to use a GPU or something else if your password is very strong. If I type ls here, there's a directory called hs. If I go into that directory and type ls there is the handshake that was captured between the TP-Link access point and the clients in this network. I was able to capture the handshake. I could have captured that from the PC or the phone. It just depends which one the application grabs first. And then I could take that capture file and then copy it to a computer with the GPU. I've linked a video below where I'll show you how to crack wifi passwords using GPUs. Make sure that you use better passwords than Spiderman. Make sure that you use good passwords in your network. Okay, so I hope you enjoyed this video. I showed you how to use a phone, in this case a pine phone to hack a wifi network, in this case a wifi network using WPA-2.

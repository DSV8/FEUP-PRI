    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine, and today, I'm partnering with Apollo Neuro to show you a super unique and interesting device in the world of wearable tech. This is the Apollo and it's all about good vibrations. Now, at first glance, you might think that this is some kind of fitness tracker, but you would be very mistaken. Rather than tracking your health, the Apollo wearable is meant to actively improve it. The Apollo wearable transforms how you feel through your sense of touch using soothing quiet vibrations. It's kind of like music that your body can feel. Let's unbox this and I'll show you what I mean. So here it is. Inside the box, we have the Apollo wearable itself, a band, a clip, and, of course, a USB charging cable. So to put it on, you can wear it around your wrist or your ankle, or you can use the clip to attach Apollo to your shirt, bra, or waistband. It does come with this one medium-sized band, which should fit most people, but they also have larger and smaller bands available if needed. What I really love is there's multiple ways to wear this so you can experiment and try different placements depending upon what's most comfortable for you. Now for me, I have been wearing this on my ankle for the most part because I already have a watch on one wrist. I usually wear a bracelet on the other wrist. And a lot of times when I'm filming, I wear a microphone that is like clipped right here to my bra. So all of these areas are taken. But guess what? My ankle is all free. And I also like this because a lot of times, I can cover it with my sock or my pants so it's super discreet. Or if I'm wearing shorts and low socks, it's actually a really fun conversational starter where people are like, \"What is that on your ankle? What is that?\" So it's been really fun to explain to them what it does. Now, what's really great about it is it was created by medical professionals and neuroscientists, and it has actually been proven to help improve areas like sleep quality, concentration, heart rate variability, performance and recovery. Apollo works with the Apollo Neuro app, so let's check it out. I'll show you guys how you can customize your experience with Apollo. I have been so sporadic over the last couple of weeks with traveling and weird sleeping patterns and having to be active and speaking at events and it's been quite hectic. So in the morning when I would wake up, I would use the good morning routine here, and this one is about 90 minutes. So I would use this after I got back from the gym or if I didn't have time to work out, I would use this sort of in replace of the gym for that morning. So I put this on while I'm getting ready. There's also a little power nap one that I've tried a few times and it's actually pretty incredible. I thankfully don't have trouble taking naps or falling asleep, but I do feel like this just puts you in sort of this very, very zen state. Now I have loved using this for energy, so you can go through here, you can do a five minute, 15 minute, or 30 minutes. So I like using this before I have to go speak or even film a video. This is actually the routine that I put on before I started filming this video. There's other routines like social. This one I like because you can adjust it to up to 120 minutes. So if you have to go to a dinner or an event, you can set that for a nice 120 minutes and it assists with your social abilities. You can focus, recover, stay calm, unwind, fall asleep. Now I don't use the fall asleep one every single night, but I have been using it especially when I travel because when I'm at home, I'm in my comfort zone. I have all of the things around me, my perfect pillows, my perfect bed temperature. When I'm traveling, that I don't have. So I've used this a ton to help me fall asleep while traveling. Now I'm someone who really struggles to focus, so unless I'm editing or writing emails, I'm listening to audiobooks to kind of keep my mind trained and focused on the audiobook while I do other tasks. And since I can't listen to audiobooks when I'm editing and doing other types of tasks, I've been using this in its replacement and it's been super helpful mostly because it has just like this gentle vibration where it's kind of, it's really hard to explain, but I kind of link it to like when you go to the doctors and they give you a shot, a lot of times the nurse will like tap on my arm or tap on my shoulder and before I know it like it's done. So it seems like it's a slight distraction, but for me specifically, it's almost aiding in my focus. Like I don't know if that makes any sense, but for me that's kind of what it's been and it's been really incredible. And why I was so interested in testing this out is because the science behind this technology is the real deal. Their research shows that users experienced up to 40% less stress and feelings of anxiety on average, up to 19% more time in deep sleep, and up to 25% more focus and concentration. Now, it's interesting because I do have the ability to track all of these things with various sleep trackers. That's something that I've been kind of working on to see how my various sleep scores and fitness scores track over time. So I can't wait to kind of go through and see this when I have all the data available. Now, overall, I think Apollo is a really great device in the world of wearable health and fitness tech, but the Apollo truly is something very different. It's not a fitness tracker. Trackers are great for gathering data over time so you can see your health trends and what you might need to do to feel better, but this device actually makes you feel better. I haven't really seen anything like this and for me it's actually been really beneficial over the last few weeks of using it. I think if anyone is interested in lowering stress or just increasing those good vibes, this is definitely something that you might want to check out and try for yourself. Click the link in my description to save up to $70 off during Apollo's Black Friday Cyber Monday sale happening November 17th to the 27th. Let me know what you guys think about the Apollo in the comments below. And is this something that you would wanna try out? I'd love to hear it. Thank you guys for watching. And I'll see you guys in the next video. Bye.",

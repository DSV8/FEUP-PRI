    "transcript": "- Oh, hey guys, just here at the mall to pick up some tech news. What, where I get it from. The global chip shortage has affected all kinds of sectors that use technology, that being all of them, but the automotive industry has had enough. Ford and General Motors have announced partnerships with various chip makers, including GlobalFoundries, TSMC, NXP Semiconductors, and Qualcomm, which the company say opens the door to joint R and D and manufacturing that could ease the burden of tightened supply lines and increase the supply of cars with more advanced features. Okay, cool. So how exactly will they do this? Yeah, they don't know. The announcements didn't mention any specific actions any of the companies will take to achieve their goals, but look, you gotta start somewhere. Step one is saying we're gonna fix the supply shortage. Step two is... I'm an ideas man. NFTs are a polarizing subject right now, but thankfully, someone made a place where everyone is welcome to download all the NFTs. You heard that right, every image linked to an NFT on the Ethereum and Solana blockchains is currently downloadable as part of a 20 terabyte torrent file hosted on thenftbay.org, 'cause that's like The Pirate Bay, 'cause... The site was put up by an Australian developer named Geoff Huntley as a way to hopefully comment on and educate the public about the nature of NFTs. As you may know, NFTs aren't an image, they're a token that may be linked to an image hosted on a server somewhere. And now, also hosted in a 20 terabyte torrent file so you can max out your internet connection to own the crypto bros. Whatever you think about them, it looks like NFTs' normalization cannot be stopped with the latest innovation being virtual commemorative tickets NFTs given to NFL fans. You can give it to your kids, say, \"I was there and this proves it.\" The twist is that your kids are NFTs too in this example, that's the future. And Facebook is backtracking a bit with a new test that will give a subset of users control once again of what they see in their newsfeed. Users in the test group will be able to turn up or turn down the amount of content they see from specific friends, groups, and pages on their personal Facebook homepage. The move is likely a response to general criticism of the way Facebook and Instagram's algorithms just make society worse. But meta is also probably trying to get ahead of proposed legislation that would force social media companies to give users the option for an algorithm-free feed. That's a trend we're seeing across multiple companies. Apple's new self repair service is undoubtedly a response to activist shareholders and pressure from the FTC, and Twitter recently dropped support for Google's AMP system for news article links, which has also come under scrutiny recently. Could it be that the internet might be getting better? Now it's time for quick bits, brought to you by Samsung, who is reopening two of their most popular Samsung Experience stores in Canada, one at Yorkdale Mall in Toronto and the other here at Metrotown Mall in Burnaby. It's right, I'm in it. And trust me, it is a vibe. Why are you looking at me? With new repair services, product training and mobile pickup areas, living the Samsung experience is easier than ever. And to celebrate, Samsung is given Canadians the chance to win a wireless charger trio or Galaxy Smart tag. So kind. Very Canadian. To enter, just post a photo of yourself at a Samsung Experience store with #SamungCanada, #SamsungContest and tag and follow Samsung Canada on Instagram. Click the links below to learn more about the giveaway and to find a Samsung Experience store near you. Maybe I'll meet you there (laughs). Look, quick bits are gonna happen in your life. At some point, you'll have to deal with them. Xbox boss Phil Spencer is a bad ass boss. Why? He recently told Axios that he hopes to see the gaming industry as a whole embrace legal emulation, a concept that I think would give Nintendo executives a collective aneurysm. Xbox has certainly been talking the talk here, between backwards compatibility and game streaming, you can play games from the original Xbox on the latest model and games from the new Series X on the last gen Xbox One. So keep being yourself, Phil. Phil, Phil, Phil, Phil, Phil, Phil, Phil. That's good enough for me (laughs). He did make Elder Scrolls 6 an Xbox exclusive though. I'll allow it. MediaTek has long been the lesser cousin to Qualcomm in the world of arm processor manufacturers, but the company's latest chip, the Dimensity 9000, could give snapdragons a run for their money. It's the first chip built with both arm's new V9 architecture and TSMC's is four nanometer process, so this thing that may just be the new mobile chip king, at least until November 30th when Qualcomm has an event scheduled. You get to sit on the throne for a little while though, at least, and that's fun. Apple's long rumored autonomous car has gotten some fresh rumors to keep the mill going, courtesy of Mark Gurman. He says the car, codenamed Project Titan, is expected to launch in 2025 with a custom Apple chip and no steering wheel or even pedals. Why would you need that anyways when Apple knows how to drive your car the best? It's just like the iPhone. Sideloading? Everything worth downloading is in the App Store. Apple knows best, but no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't, shh, shh, sleep now. Warner Brothers has taken the wraps off it's Super Smash Bros style fighting game, which is bafflingly not named Warner Smash Bros, big mistake. You can pit DC heroes like Superman against Shaggy from Scooby-Doo and Arya Stark from Game of Thrones? Is this how weird the first Smash Bros felt when it came out? Does everyone in the game have kryptonite or something? What is the lore here? And a teen in Hamilton, Ontario was just arrested for stealing 36 million US dollars, or 46 million Canadian, in cryptocurrency last year using a SIM swapping technique to hijack someone's two-factor authentication. Police were able to locate the team because they used the money to purchase a rare online username, which is what anybody would use millions of dollars for. I'm gonna blame this on NFTs somehow. But don't blame me for ending this episode because it's over. Come back on Monday for more tech news, we'll be back in the studio. But at first, I gotta get some bubble tea, because there's, is there a bubble tea place here? I haven't been here in a while (laughs) and play with some folding phones. (laughs)",

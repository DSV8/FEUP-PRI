    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine. And today we are reviewing the brand-new vlogging camera from Sony. Now, this isn't just a vlogging camera. Basically, they're comparing this to one of their higher-end mirrorless cameras, which is the a9. So to pack a lot of things that people love about the a9 into this tiny point-and-shoot is beyond incredible. But for me, I don't really take a lot of photos. I do a lot of video, and I'm always on the hunt for the perfect vlogging camera. And so far, we are so, so close to having a perfect camera. But this now officially has (softly gasps) a mic jack! It's about time. That's all I'll say. The RX100 line has been one of my favorite vlogging cameras for a long time. This is gonna change everything. The only thing that I ever wanted was a very small point-and-shoot camera with a mic input. And not only are we getting the mic input, but we're getting a super powerful camera. It takes incredible photos. The auto focus is just beyond anything that you guys will expect from something so small. It has continuous eye auto focus, which is something that I really love, and it also has animal eye focus, which only works in still photos. Hopefully soon they'll have a firmware update so you'll be able to do that in video, as well. But let's take a look at this thing. So it has the flip up screen that you guys are used to in most of the RX lines. This also shoots 21 megapixels. It has a 24 to 200 millimeter zoom. Like, that's excessive. It doesn't have a built-in ND filter, which I used a lot in the RX100 Mark V, but I think overall if you are outside shooting, you will notice a little bit of a difference if you had the previous version and you used the ND filter quite often. But man, did I mention that it has a mic jack? It uses the same batteries as the previous versions, so if you have a bunch of these from your older cameras, you can still use those. But what I wanted to show you guys today are some of the rigs that I have come up with. What I love about this is I am so sick of lugging around a huge camera. Like, I don't want to do it anymore. It's exhausting, and when I'm traveling, I just want to shoot, get cool shots, and not have to be burdened with a bunch of stuff. So this is really, really exciting. Let me get my little basket of goodies. I went into my tech closet, did a little shopping, and I picked out some things that I think I will like to use with this. You guys have seen this before. My sister Jenna uses this a lot because she vlogs a little bit more than I do now. It not only acts like a little tripod, but it also has some controls here. So you can take photos, you can zoom in and out, and out you could also start and stop recordings. This is a very tiny little microphone, and this thing cost $25 on Amazon. One of the things that I noticed with this camera is I had been doing a bunch of mic tests and I couldn't understand why some of the mics would work and some of them wouldn't. It's a 3.5 millimeter jack. Why is this not working? There's various types of these 3.5 millimeter jacks. So this one is a TRS, and you can tell because it only has one ring. And this one is just a little RDE Lav microphone. So this is a TRRS, so it has two rings. So if you do want to use this, you will need a little adapter, which I actually got one with this RDE mic, so it will convert your TRRS to a TRS and you'll be able to use it. So I went on Amazon it was trying to find the smallest TRS microphone that I could find that would work with this. So this is how I like to use it, and I just plug it in just like so. I did a quick little video test with this in a previous video, but what I love about this is it is so small and it sounds really good. So if I'm filming, I can flip it around, and you can hear the audio from here. Or I'm filming somebody else, I can just flip it right to the front. So there we go. Another weird little setup that I was doing, which is so dumb, I was just running this wire directly into the camera, and I was just clipping this to my shirt. and this makes it super simple to just get really quick shots with really great audio. I went to Maine recently for a fun little vacation. I've never been to Maine. A side note, it's beautiful, so everybody that lives there props on your homeland. It was super windy and I was about to hop on the sailboat, so I thought this would be a perfect test of using this little setup. (soft music) I'm about to get on the sailboat. I'm in Camden, Maine, right now. This is actually my first time in Maine, and it's so beautiful. This is the boat that I'm about to get on. This is the Old Lad Literature. I keep calling the Olaf, but I think that might be a snowman. This is something that I'm extremely excited about. All of my other YouTuber friends, everyone has basically been using these. These are the RDE Wireless Go microphones. I know Farooq is a huge fan of these, and he basically was like you gotta get it. And this is exciting because it's gonna be a perfect setup for this little guy. Another microphone option, this is the microphone that I always use when I'm vlogging because it does work with a hot shoe. So in any of the Sony cameras you can just plug this right in. You don't need any wires or anything. That is one thing that I really wish that this would have. But instead, they have this, (camera clicks) a view finder. So the view finder is really great when you're out taking photos or videos in really sunny situations. I think you'd be into that, Tyler. You like the viewfinder, don't you? (laughs) I always see Tyler's out there using the viewfinder. Okay well, still got another tripod option, also got this little bracket mount that I use quite often, and this one which I just found is going to be honestly, I think, the perfect thing for this setup. So this is super small, and what's great about these little RDE mics is this little clip. Oh god! This is actually the microphone, so you can look super silly and just clip this to your shirt, and like that's a Lav. So this little clip just clips right here into like a cold shoe. I mean this is, I mean this is seriously game-changing. Like, I'm shook. So this looks a little silly, but honestly find me a smaller setup. I'll wait. (gasps) Oh my god, I'm so happy! This is everything I've ever wanted. Look at this little thing! I may need to do a little bit of cable management. So far this is my favorite rig, but now I want to do an audio test of what each one of these options sound like. This is the audio of the on-board Sony RX100 Mark VII. This is what it sounds like with no microphones attached, absolutely nothing. This is it. And you can tell if I get a little bit closer the audio obviously is a little bit better because I'm closer to the microphones. So this is probably about where I would be when I'm vlogging. Now, let's plug in the RDE Wireless Go. So this is the setup using the RDE Wireless Go microphone. I'm using the Lav of connected to the little Wireless Go. I also want to try this out without the wireless Lav. I'm gonna unplug this Lav from the little Wireless Go, and I'm gonna plug this Lav directly into the camera. So this will give us an option of what it sounds like if I decide to not use this and just look silly with a cable hanging off of my camera. So that looks like it's working and the Lav is attached to me. I look silly. This is about as far, I think, as I can get without pulling the camera over. It's definitely not a good look, but hopefully it sounds okay. Now, let's move on to my favorite little tiny $24 nugget. So this is a test of this little tiny microphone. And make sure whatever you guys are plugging things into this mic input that it's pressed in all the way because I just made a huge mistake and it wasn't pushed it all the way and this was the audio that I got from that shot. I also love that I can flip it around. So Tyler, say something. - [Tyler] Hi, hi, hi, hi! - Now, I'm gonna flip it. (camera buzzing) - [Tyler] Hi, welcome to Chili's. - So always make sure that it's actually plugged in because I've lost so much footage in the past because of something so simple like that. This is what it sounds like with that other little hot shoe Sony microphone. How does it sound? Are you guys enjoying this? So I'm a little bit further away. And obviously, I'd be vlogging probably about somewhere right here. Okay, audio test over. Another thing that I love is you can do interval shooting, so you can also shoot RAW and JPEG. So you can get some really high-quality time lapses. I shot this, it was really dark, so I'm surprised this came out as well as it did. This was the moon rising above a lighthouse. I'm so excited that they have interval shooting in this camera. They first released it with the a6400, and then they later released a firmware update for some of their mirrorless cameras. So with this, it makes it super simple, and I also love that you can shoot in RAW, as well, so you can get some really high quality shots. Here's a few photos that I took in Maine. Most of these are just all on auto. I did do a little color correcting in Lightroom, so they aren't directly from the camera. I also mentioned about picture profiles which is really fun, especially if you do like to color grade your footage and have more flexibility. So we're shooting in S-Log2. So here's what that shot looks like with a little bit of color grading. It's fantastic. I'm not very good at grading, so don't judge me for my skills. There's also some new steady shot options, so there's active, standard, and just off. So if you do have it on active, it does crop the image a little bit. I would recommend probably keeping it on standard unless you're super unsteady, then keep it on active. Really, I think just do what you want. These are just merely suggestions. Whatever you think works, do that. I'm gonna show you probably my ideal setup which I will use most of the time. So I probably would most likely use this tripod and use this little guy. I really, really like this a lot. After vlogging for so many years, it gets extremely tiring. And the shots that you can get with this camera, they're comparable to a lot of these mirrorless cameras. Because this is not an inexpensive camera. This is about $1,200. So you are paying for something that is extremely powerful. Another thing, you guys know that I love slo-mo shots. This also has high frame rate built into it. So there's a little high frame rate option, so you just flip that over to there. You hit the movie button. (soft music) (camera beeps) (laughs) It gives you a little preview. Oh that's weird. I don't like that. Ew, that's disgusting. My fingers look like they're gonna fall off my hand. I hate everything that I just filmed. So the high frame rate settings you can shoot 240, 480, and 960 frames a second. Another thing that's really cool about this camera is you can shoot 20 frames a second continuous shooting with no blackout, and it'll just look like you're filming a video, but you're actually taking photos. Well, I absolutely love this camera. I've been having so much fun with it. But right now, we're gonna go out and shoot a vlog. I was gonna say it's a fake of vlog, but it's gonna be a real vlog but it's like a forced vlog for the sake of this camera. So you get the point. I'm gonna go vlog with this now. So let's go outside. Where should we go? I want coffee. - [Tyler] Coffee! - Coffee please! Okay, we're driving. We're going to get coffee. This is a vlog. This is a forced vlog. We're forcing an activity right now, which is what most vlogging is. If anyone tells you otherwise, they're a complete liar. Forced vlog, coffee. I'm forcing you guys to get coffee with me. Jenna was previewing the audio, and she said it sounded a little bit low. So on the actual camera itself you can adjust the level. So previously I had it at 15 and I just changed it to 18. So Jenna, test and see how that sounds. I think this will be better. - [Jenna] So it's my fault if it's not better? - Well... - [Jenna] I'm gonna get an iced vanilla late-- - Oh my gosh. Me too! - [Jenna] Probably no CBD. - No CBD because I already had some CBD this morning. And I think it's swelling my tongue. I think I'm having a reaction. - [Jenna] Wow, this is a slow zoom. - Can you do fast zoom? - [Jenna] Yeah, I can change it. - No way! Look how fast that is! Okay, I've had one of these cameras for so long. You can do that on all of them? - [Jenna] Yeah. - I did not experiment in the settings enough. We're almost there. Fast zoom. Are you recording? Okay, this is super riveting content. I am putting money in the meter, and we have 20 minutes so we're gonna need to make haste. Make haste? Do with haste? Be hastily? Oh, it's busy today. (soft upbeat music) Do we all want like regular milk, nonfat? - Yes, I would like regular milk. - Okay, hi, how are you? (upbeat music) I'll go give this to Jenna, Jenna's coffee. Thank you. Here you go, Jen. They even have like fresh homemade vanilla sugar. It's incredible. - Thank you, did you put it in mine, too? - I did. - Wow, thanks. Oh, this is lovely. - Yeah, it's really good. I think this vlog is going really well. - What have you done so far? - Well, we drove here. We drank coffee. What will we do next? - This is it, this is all you've done so far? I do like the 200 millimeter zoom. - I know! - It's great for nature. - I am super into nature. Look what Tyler's doing right now. He's using the viewfinder. I knew you'd be so into that. Do you like it? - Yeah, it's kind of cool because on a lot of cameras you're blocked. I can see like the world around outside and the viewfinder at the same time. So if someone tries to like throw something at me, I'll know and ill be able to catch it. - One of the other cool things this camera has is it can detect the orientation that the camera is being held. So right now Jenna is holding this in a vertical format. So this will automatically flip. So this makes it super easy to import photos and videos from your camera directly to your phone, and you post on Instagram stories, or I don't know, I'm super into vertical video. I think it's really cool. Bye bye, FedEx! See ya! See ya! - [Jenna] He did not like us. - He almost hit us. (upbeat music) I've been making it my goal to make this my main camera that I travel with, so I went and got one of the RX100 small rigs. This rig is so awesome. It's pretty low profile, so it's not that huge. But as you can see, it has like a really cool little grip on here, and everything fits so perfect. It still gives you access to all of the ports. It also allows you to have access to the battery and SD card. It's such a perfect snug fit. Even the viewfinder fits. And guess what else, the flash still works. You still have access to do the zoom. Everything is just so perfect on this, like I can't believe it. The main reason that I got this is because I want to be able to mount things on it. I don't have the proper mount yet, but I have it ordered and it hasn't come in yet. So right now I've just been clipping the RDE mic right on this just like so. You can clip it right on the rail and then plug it in. I mean, like who's not gonna want to vlog with this setup? Like, I might honestly start vlogging again. Well, thank you guys so much for watching. I hope you guys enjoyed this video. Don't forget to subscribe if you enjoyed this video, and make sure you like it and hit the bell and do all the things that us YouTubers tell you to do here on YouTube. This is Justine signing off. Hello and goodbye. Why did I say that? I've never said that in my life. (upbeat music)",

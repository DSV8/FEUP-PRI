    "transcript": "- What's up guys, Louis here back with another video, and today we are checking out two products from WD. These are from the My Cloud series, and essentially what you're looking at is something that sort of looks like a traditional hard drive, but in this case, it's actually some Cloud storage. These are network attached, you're not gonna have these things connected locally to your laptop, computer desktop, or otherwise. Instead, you can connect these to your router, essentially have your files available to you no matter where you are. Now I have two of them here. This one is kind of the more more basic version, 2 terabytes of storage, one drive. Over here, is the Mirror, and essentially what you're getting here is two physical drives inside, and they're set up by default in a mirror mode, or RAID 1, for those technology enthusiasts out there that are looking for a reason to say RAID, cause it feels good. RAID. Oh my hard drives? Yeah, they're, they're in RAID. In the catastrophic event that one hard drive fails, which can happen, you've then got another backup, so you've backed up to here, and then it's backed itself up again, to the other physical disk inside of this RAID 1, or more simply, mirror. Mirror, mirror, on the wall, Jack's the fairest of them all. So let's open these babies up and compare them. This will work on PC, Mac, and there's also a mobile app, so it'll work on iOS and Android. If you can describe a setup, explain how to set something up in a small piece of paper like that, that's a good thing, people like that. Plug it in, to your router, give it a few seconds. Mycloud.com/setup. Boom! Of course, an Ethernet cable, some power. An important component in any gadget's life, power. Don't know what else to say about that. So there it is, ooh. (Unpeeling) Ah. Here you've got your power, Ethernet, and then you've also got a USB 3 port, it looks like. You can probably then connect another peripheral here, to this drive, to then share via the network features on this bad boy. Look, we have one more plastic wrap removal. This is what you guys signed up for. (Unpeeling) Whew! A similar power port, Ethernet port, and in this case, two USB 3 ports. you've got you're two physical drives installed. Desktop, three and half inch drives, a power brick? And an Ethernet cable. What I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna take this mirror here, and I'm gonna connect it to the network, and then I'm gonna show you guys how the setup functions, and I'll also sort of, use it in conjunction with the drive that I'm currently using, so you can see that both of them can operate in harmony. Okay so, Okay so now I've got the My Cloud Mirror connected to my router, then you just install the My Cloud app, there's an opportunity to manage any devices that are connected to the network. In my particular case, it just found the new My Cloud Mirror you can also see my EX4, which was previously connected in this same window here. One of the features that is probably most useful for people is the ability to move stuff from your phone, onto these giant storage devices. So if I select mobile device from this drop down menu here, I'll go ahead and jump into camera for example, taking a lot of video, keeping a lot of music, and so on, and at some point you may end up having to delete stuff, but in this case, you don't have to, you can just move it over to one of these devices, right from on the mobile device. If I select a photo here, then I select this little menu button up here, move, and then here you see the new WDMyCloudMirror, click on that, click on public, share pictures, check mark, and just like that, that photo is now uploaded. So you got photos, but what about video? You can actually stream video from right within, (video plays) Let's say, for example, you've got some music on here, and you got a blue tooth speaker like this one, and you do a double stream, stream to here, and then stream the data over here, to this blue tooth speaker. This song, is not stored on my phone. It's stored on the Cloud, in the Cloud, on the Cloud, near the Cloud, in it. People are using mobile devices more as their primary computing devices, so having the support here to manage network attached storage, which used to be a fairly complicated thing to manage, is pretty impressive. Sharing your files is really easy, you can see. Here's stuff that's shared with me, and here's stuff that's shared with others, and you'll see the share button comes up. I can share a link with people, who can then go ahead and view it from there, or I can share it privately, so that that link only works for them. One of the things I liked, is I'm not super organized, I just chucked a bunch of stuff on it, and it scanned it for certain types of media. In the menu here, you have all photos, and it just, it grabbed them. Same goes for music and videos for that matter. So, there you have it. The WD My Cloud Mirror, as well as just the regular My Cloud, whichever one's more suitable to you. Pricing and availability links will be down in the description, and also, gonna be giving away a few of these, thanks to WD, we're gonna give away two of the standard My Cloud, and two of the My Cloud Mirror's. I'll be doing that on Instagram, so head over to my Instagram for your chance to win. Just let me know, what you might store on there. Keep it clean guys. Thanks very much for watching, all the links that you need to know about will be down in the description. Leave a thumbs up if you enjoyed this and I'll catch you on the next episode, later guys. Later Jack. - [Jack] Later.",

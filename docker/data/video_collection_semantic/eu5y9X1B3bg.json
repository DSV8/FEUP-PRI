    "transcript": "- Hey everybody, I am holding the iPhone 11 Pro, and you can tell it's a Pro because it has this big square with three lenses on it. And, a matte finish. Now those are the first things you'll notice about it, but what's important about it is what it can do, and what's inside. So let's check it out. So I said I wanted to move on from the matte finish right away, but I actually don't, because it's really nice. It feels much better. Now this is a new kind of glass that Apple says is more durable, and it seamlessly goes into that camera. It's all one piece of glass, which should help with it's durability. The other thing that you'll see on the outside is a new super retina XDR display. Now what does all that mean? Well it means that it can get even brighter, it can get up to 1200 nits. And it has a two million to one contrast ratio. But I think most importantly for me, and maybe for you, is that it's 15% more battery efficient. So it should help your battery last longer. Apple says that the 11 Pro gets four hours more than the iPhone 10-S, while the 11 Pro-Max, can get up to five hours more than the iPhone 10-S Max. Now the other reason that this should be more efficient is it has a new A13 Bionic processor. It is of course, faster than the last processor. And Apple says that it has the most powerful GPU, or CPU, ever, on a smartphone. And you know what, that's not that much of a surprise, it's not like anything was catching up to the A12 in the first place. But this is definitely doing a pretty good job rendering a web page really, really fast. But the most important thing to talk about is cameras. There is a telephoto, the standard wide angle, and now an ultra-wide. There's three there, they're all 12 megapixels, and they can all basically record the same quality video, and take basically the same quality photos. So, not a single one of them is the worse quality than the others over all. So if we look inside the camera app, actually, weirdly, my favorite thing is this new redesigned camera app. So when you're in the standard 1X mode, the viewfinder fills the whole screen which, looks cool, but also it lets you know the mode of photo you're taking, without having to see a little button. You can go to the wide and then it zooms in. Or we can go, all the way out with the telephoto. Or, like on a Samsung, you can drag your finger, and as you drag your finger, you can see it also shows you the millimeter. So, if you actually speak like a camera person, you understand that the 2X is a 52 millimeter equivalent, the wide is a 26 millimeter equivalent, and then the ultra-wide is a 13 millimeter equivalent. Now, the selfie camera, is also better now. It is a 12 megapixel camera, and it has a standard wide, or zooms in, so you can choose whether you want the wide angle or not. But it still a single lens. Speaking of the selfie camera, up here there's also of course the face ID. Apple says it's faster, but it also says that it works better at multiple angles. So you won't have to pick up the phone and look at it with a bunch of attention. It might work when you're just on your desk, and you glance at it. Now there are some other features in the camera we're talking about, one thing that isn't here yet is night mode, which will be, hopefully an equivalent to what the Google Pixel's doing, or theoretically, better. You also have this new quick capture feature. So instead of just taking a photo, I can hold my finger down, and it'll start recording a video there. Which is really nice, it works basically the way that, I don't know, that like Instagram works, which I must prefer that. The other thing that it's doing is a whole lot more machine learning. So if we take a photo here, they're doing a lot of analysis of what's in the photo, which will theoretically allow it to pick up things, like they showed like sweater grain and so on. I have no idea if it's actually happening here, but, for certain scenes, they're doing a lot more neural analysis and machine learning on the photo itself to improve it's quality. Now there are a few other odds and ends to talk about. It comes in a new midnight green color, which hopefully we're gonna go see. And, I deeply love the midnight green color, like way too much. It no longer has like the haptic 3D touch, you sort of do long presses instead to do that, and I don't miss that at all. It still uses a lightening port, wah wah. But, it comes with an 18 watt charger in the box, finally! And that 18 watt charger uses USBC, finally, so you know, baby steps, we're getting there. So, that's exciting. So this iPhone 11 Pro starts at $999, the iPhone 11 Pro Max starts at $1099. You can get different storage options to bring the Pro Max all the way up to, I think, $1450 bucks. Pre-orders start on September 13th, and they start shipping on September 20th, so really quick. Hey everybody, thanks so much for watching, it's Apple day, it's always crazy in here, it's super crazy behind me and we're gonna go into the craziness and get more hands on. So keep it locked to \"The Verge.\"",

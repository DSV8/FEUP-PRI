    "transcript": "so I've been using the Galaxy S10 for about four weeks now and I'm still compiling my thoughts about this smartphone so expect my long term of you some time later now I didn't want you guys to hang in until then for some content around this device so I decided to focus on one of the key aspects of the s10 the cameras now I'm also aware of Huawei's recently announced P30 Pro and it's incredible camera system I'm hoping to get my hands on the device soon so if you're interested in a comparison between the S10 and the P30 pro let us know in the comments down below switching gears to S10 recently I got a chance to test the cameras to its absolute best on my recent trip to the States and it was a lot of fun exploring the setup but at the same time also taking a closer look at the detail and evaluating things like color low-light performance video quality as well so let's take a look at that right after message from our sponsor the new razer blade 15 is a machine for people who know exactly what they want when you need a reliable keyboard and one custom lighting when you need an accurate display and what insanely fast 144 Hertz refresh rate when you need a portable machine and want a gorgeous thin aluminum unibody in the world's smallest 15.6 inch gaming laptop when you need powerful gaming hardware to truly dominate with GeForce rtx the Razer Blade 15 when you need the power for anything you do and will nothing to hold you back check out the configuration you want down below okay so just to refresh your memory the s10 has a standard wide angle 12 megapixel sensor with a variable aperture mode that shifts between F 1.5 and 2.4 remember it's the exact same setup found on the s9 then it has a 12 megapixel telephoto lens with an F 2.4 aperture and it's 2 times the optical zoom range of a standard wide-angle lens the interesting addition to the s10 this year is the 16 megapixel ultra wide-angle lens with a field of view of a hundred and 23 degrees we first saw this feature with LG's G series of phones and I guess it was just a matter of time for Samsung and a few other brands to adapt this feature before I get to the results I do want to quickly talk about the user interface it's pretty simple and easy to get accustomed to so you can quickly switch between different lenses by simply tap on the respective ones you can also switch between different modes like life focus video pro mode that gives you full control of the shutter speed ISO white balance etc there are also some slow-motion capabilities built in into the s10 and it's very fast in switching thanks to the powerful specs baked in there also some filters headed to the app which i think is completely pointless in my opinion but you may like them especially if you're into selfies and things like beauty mode shaun suggestions is also a really cool feature added to the s10 it's essentially on-screen guides to help you line up for straight compositions there's also scene optimizer that identify certain subjects in the background and it optimizes the color for that particular subject I personally ended up turning it off because I wanted to get the true representation coming out of these sensors now I shot all of these photos in auto mode with HDR turned on and as you can see it's pretty darn impressive in well-lit situations for example in this shot the colors a nice and vibrant not super saturated there is a good balance between the highlights and the shadows thanks to HDR of course if you're into food photography the s10 shouldn't disappoint to you again it does a really good job capturing colors and honestly portraying what it looks like in real life however low-light performance isn't really the S10's Forte as you can see the detail completely falls apart around the branches it also does tend to soften the image as well but on a good note it still manages to capture true to life colors the additional wide-angle lens is by far my favorite feature on the instant it comes in really useful in certain situations especially if you need to get a lot of subjects in the frame I mean take a look at this shot I recently got the chance to watch a hockey game and I wanted to share the ambience or the excitement level in the arena and I was able to do that with the s10 and the result look absolutely spectacular here's another first-person perspective of me go-karting and again by taking advantage of the ultra wide-angle lens it just really gives you a cool perspective and I loved it now the telephoto lens can be used to take interesting abstract images if you're looking for good symmetry and best part is that you still get great dynamic range and color rendition so nothing to complain here it still manages to keep consistent colors as well as detail but albeit samsung's post-processing on all of these photos are a tad aggressive in my opinion but really if you need that extra reach especially with sports photography the extra telephoto lens could be an awesome feature to take advantage of here's the same shot with the standard wide-angle lens and boom ultra wide and I took these in a matter of seconds which is just impossible with a traditional DSLR or mirrorless camera then there's macro shooting and it's absolutely incredible I use the telephoto lens to get as close as possible to the subject and the results as you can see are quite amazing the subject isn't focused the colors are really nice and this is something that you really can't achieve with a single lens setup on a smartphone and listen until if you decide to go for third-party lens mounting accessories alright so I also want to compare the s10 to my pixel 3 to see how it actually does and the one thing that I found in common throughout this comparison is the fact that the pixel just takes the edge in the detail Department compared to the s10 but again that's only if your pixel peeping in low-light scenarios it's a hard pick to be honest because on one hand the pixel is a bit sharper but the s10 is more true to life in terms of colors speaking of colors that's another aspect that I really wanted to talk about because the s10 leans towards more on a neutral side which is you know either cooler or warmer again it's a hit or miss depending on the situation whereas the pixel again it takes the lead with detail and in some cases it just processes the image especially in the colors when it comes to the greens and the purples because it starts to increase the it starts to add a lot more magenta to the image in some cases as well so again I'm glad that they're a third party photo app so that you that can be used to edit these photos and kind of you know enhance it the way you want it to look but if you're looking for the best colors out of the box the s10 takes the edge here but let us know what you prefer in the comments down below I also got a chance to test portrait mode on both devices Samsung calls it live focus which allows you to adjust the blur in the background in real time which is pretty neat and as you can see both cameras look pretty good personally I like the field of view of the s10 as its not super close as a subject come to the pixel that actually crops into the sensor to achieve the effect here's another shot in with good lighting I want to say that edge detection still has a long way to go on both cameras but I still do like the image coming out of the pixel the front-facing cameras are great on both devices um the s10 likes overexposing just a bit and it also likes to smooth my face by like 10 percent which may or may not be a good thing whereas the pixel just takes the edge here since you know it has two front-facing cameras one which gets you the traditional wide-angle and an ultra wide-angle lens as well and it captures great detail dynamic range and colors as well I also got a chance to test out nightscape on the pixel 3 to see how it actually plays out compared to the s10 and as you can see there's clearly a huge difference between the two the incident does have a night mode built inside the scene optimizer feature but it only turns on when it detects that the subject is in pitch black so there isn't a dedicated night mode like what you'd find on the pixel and as you can see the colors and the detail just more better on the pixel compared to the s 10 so this is the rear facing video test on both these devices and as you can tell probably see the pixel 3 is more leaning a cooler tone whereas the galaxy is 10 is more true to life and naturally this kind of really beautiful out here in New York City so that's another thing also it's also a good representation on what the microphone sounds like I want a nerd thoughts about that in the comments lastly I do want to cover on the compactor pixel three props it a little bit on the sensor which could be a limitation for somebody out there whereas the galaxy s10 has the ability to switch between the ultra wide-angle lens as well as the telephoto and the wide-angle lens but do keep in mind that I can only be done when you're shooting in 1080p and 4k at 30 frames per second we can't do it in 4k at 6 TV movie you'll wear to the front-facing camera test this is exactly what you're gonna be getting out of the box without any filters anything applied I feel like the microphone on the pixel is just a bit muted in terms of dynamic range the s10 steals a show here I think the pixel is just a bit more overexposed I mean the galaxy s10 has a good balance between the highlights and the shadows and you also get again more true-to-life image compared to the pixel so I when it comes to video quality overall I go with the s10 any time of the day you gotta appreciate the smooth and engaging sound with massdrop hifiman he-4xx planar magnetic headphones that sound amazing without a fancy amp and they're built to satisfy your ears and not destroy your wallet check out the drop down below so this brings us to the conclusion and honestly I really enjoyed my time playing around the estin and the cameras of course now do I see myself taking advantage of all three lenses absolutely because having that ultra wide-angle lens is so awesome especially if you want to capture something interesting especially when it comes to different events if you are someone who likes adventure photography then I think the ultra wedding lens is absolutely a great implementation because you don't have to worry about carrying a mirrorless camera or DSLR camera with multiple lenses because you have all of those three implemented in a single package sure it doesn't have the best quality in the detail Department but honestly for social media and sharing pictures online for that kind of stuff it will get the job done that's that's what it is so let me know what you guys think about the camera comparison or I guess the quality coming out of the s10 in the comments down below I looked in your thoughts about it and what are your expectations for a smartphone especially in 2019 in the camera department do you prefer having these three lenses or are you just okay with an ultra wide-angle lens and a standard wide-angle lens I want to know your thoughts about down two comments I mean where the Hydra connects thank you so much for watching make sure to check out some relevant content over here subscribe to our boot sequence channel I'm signing off and I'll see you guys in the next one",

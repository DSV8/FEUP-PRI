    "transcript": "this video was brought to you by NCIX great technology selections and service hello everyone i'm Dmitry with Hardware Canucks and we attended the Berlin Aoife which is an equivalent of a CES in las vegas and computex in taipei and where everything technology related comes together in berlin to show off their latest introductions into the market and this time Samsung really put on a show of dominance within the consumer electronics fear obviously there was emphasis on curved display technology with screens getting bigger and better and desktop monitors starting to catch up to the curve with 21 by 9 aspect ratio panels being on the receiving end of it and the biggest hit / were in the mobile sector and wearables and starting with the Galaxy gear s it's another SmartWatch made to complement your Samsung smartphone now with a 2 inch curved Super AMOLED display with resolution 360 x 480 packing in 2g and 3g connectivity Wi-Fi b/g/n it's running Tizen on a dual-core chip with a 300 million power battery 512 megabytes of ram and 4 gigabytes of built-in storage of course health and athletic aspects are fully incorporated to work without a smartphone and for those already owning a galaxy gear smartwatch this is just going to be a slightly enhanced version of the gear 2 neo with a new curved body design with actual metal frame that feels really solid now the curve face is a step in the right direction as it forms a nice shape for the arm although it's still quite large but with the size we have extra features like a full keyboard so you can respond text messages and emails directly from the gear s and gain that extra real estate for the rest of the applications the wristband is made of comfortable rubber in both black and white and of course being a watch there are multiple watch faces to choose from although nothing super fantastic in terms of design and moving on to the Galaxy Tab active this is a new 8-inch tablet made to be durable and protected against the elements as it is waterproof without needing a case it's fully dustproof and sand proof and it's also drop proof although you will need a protective case for that and it comes with a removable cover and the massive 4450 milliamp hour battery pack and it looks rigid to withstand some harsh handling with large physical home back and multi window buttons at the front there's also power and volume rocker on the side placement of the button feels just right with great tactile click nothing mushy with pogo pin on the side for easier charging nothing outstanding in the specs Department that the 8 inch display is only 1280 by 800 with pixel density of 189 it is still quite like though at just under 400 grams it is running Android 4.4 KitKat with 1.5 gig of ram and 16 gigabytes of internal storage with a microSD card slot above the battery to expand your storage capacity and it seemed responsive from the time I've had with it and really the selling point here is this industrial focus on durability so now let's move on to the most popular devices on the show floor starting with the Galaxy Note 4 now with an actual metal frame outstanding pixel dense 5.7 Super AMOLED display with 2560 x 1440 resolution the note 4 is everything that I think many people are expecting with an approved build quality and a high res screen incorporated fingerprint sensor into the home button and the s pen that has seen some changes please note that the large pan I'm using here is not the standard pan that comes with a North for and one interesting aspect of this device is incorporation of fast charging that brings your device from zero to fifty percent in just half an hour very impressive the leather cover at the back looks great to my eye and adult for definitely feels like a premium handset that is an improvement over the note 3 in almost every way now moving into the galaxy note edge which basically is a note for in every way with an added curve strip on the right side to display additional information and host your icons it is an interesting approach to explain how we interact with the screen especially since it modifies the form and from the time that I've spent with the note edge it was a bit awkward to be honest in the handling department as the right side thins out and holding a non-symmetric body on a phone on a smartphone would require some period of adjustment the curve is 160 pixels in width and it's a seamless transition into the main display so there's a certain way you need to touch the curve to activate it I found the camera app very useful with this implementation as the shutter button is right there for your thumb and mainly I think it's a way to remove the icons from their traditional spot on the home screen to expand the overall real estate and allow quicker access to your most used apps with a quick tip of your thumb without needing to modify the grip the curve can be used to display the time when the phone is off and access quick shortcuts like voice record time stop flashlight and some more plus Samsung is opening this up for developers to experiment with with many other applications and uses an overall Samsung really showed off their desire for a competitive and aggressive presence in the mobile market and they have done exactly that with all these new releases so what are your thoughts on the gear as the tap active the note 4 and the note edge and do any of these excite you to migrate to these devices when they finally become available to the public so let us know in the comments below how you feel about all these new gadgets give us a like and subscribe for more similar content and we'll see you in the next one",

    "transcript": "- Today's video is sponsored by Anker. Yo guys, Jonathan here. Maybe you picked up an iPhone X, maybe you didn't. But if you did, today this is the video for you because I'm covering some of the best accessories you can pick up, and I'm kicking it off with a question I get quite frequently. That is, what is the best wireless charger. Now there are a ton of different options out there, but the one I'm recommending, is the one I've been personally using for the last couple of weeks. This is the Mophie wireless charging base. It's not fancy, it's not flashy, but it definitely does the job. What I like about it specifically is one it's very compact, and two everything is connected, so you're not going to need to carry multiple parts. So when you combine those two factors together, in addition to making a great option for your desk, it's also great for traveling as well. Now on the technical side this will output up to 7.5 watts in terms of wireless charging. I believe it's actually more than Apple currently supports on the 8, the 8+ and the X. But it's nice to know when they kind of kick that open and unlock it you will be supported with this charger. As far as how it works, there's not really too much to say. You place the iPhone down on the charger, it charges, and that's about it. It's been really consistent, honestly has worked pretty much every single time for me. Next if you've been looking to pick up a Bluetooth speaker for your iPhone X or just a Bluetooth speaker in general the UE Wonderboom is one of my favorites. Not going to lie, it kind of looks like a mini home pod, let me know if you agree. Now this Wonderboom comes in some fancy pants colors. Cashmere pink, fireball red, lilac, phantom black, stone gray, and sub-zero blue. You get 10 hours of battery life. Surprisingly really fantastic sound especially for the size, and not only is it water proof, not only is it portable, but it's durable too - [Sound Guy] Dude. - That the inadvertent drop test. Now one thing I don't normally test out with Bluetooth speakers, maybe I should, is the range. Range is very important. So we're going to start that today. (Music playing) Now I'm leaving my iPhone over there unattended, probably not the smartest thing, but. (music continues) (music stops) (music continues) (music stops) (music continues) So like, that's like the cut off. I have no idea how far that is technically, maybe. So it's like 108, 110. That's a good eye Rich. So that's the other enticing thing with the UE Wonderboom is the fact that it is water resistant. Here I am, as you can tell next to some water. Got it playing right now. And we're going to dip it in. Man that is some nice refreshing cold arrowhead water. Not really. Either way though, works well, looks even cooler. Give a little volume test. I mean what else could you ask for, it's portable, looks great, comes in a few different colors, water resistance. It might be the perfect Bluetooth speaker for your iPhone X. Now as far as cases go, I actually enjoy Apple's official iPhone X case. They come in a billion different colors, all of which DetroitBORG has. So if you want to check all those colors out, make sure you check out his video. But on top of that, they fit well, they don't add a ton of weight. But the problem with them is one, they don't add a ton of protection. Two they are expensive as sh- - [Rich] Demonetized. - So with that said if you don't got a ton of money to spend on a case, this the Anker Karapax shield case is $7.99. That's one of the cheapest I've seen. Beyond what's cool with this case is the cutouts. Every single one of them are razor sharp. The dual lenses, the mute switch, the lightning port, the grills, they are all very very precise. And I really really like the buttons on this. The volume up, the volume down. That new and improved bigger, badder, better side button is super clicky. What's cool with this is one, it's a two layer case so you're going to get a little bit of added protection especially for the price. Two, we got some carbon fiber elements, so if you like that look, it's going to be perfect for you. And three, we're going to get that lip protection. So I personally like to set my phone down like that, but I've had a bad habit of scratching the crap out of my phone. But with this, it's going to give you both back and front protection. I don't really want to do this, but. It didn't sound good. So there you have it. Didn't matter if I would have dropped it anyways. But you can actually buy 125 of these cases for the price of an iPhone X. So maybe you want to have a back catalog. Maybe you want to go through these like crazy. Check out the link below. Next up we are talking headphones for the iPhone X. And this is the Beats Studio 3. And I know, every time Beats is mentioned, an audiophile out there has a heart attack. But, these actually are quite alot better than you might think. One, the biggest biggest attractive thing with this is the W1 chip. So just like the airpods, and how easy those connect, they improve battery life. This is inside the Beats Studio 3. So this is my first time pairing these headphones to this iPhone X. Powered them on, this icon pops up. Press connect, we're going to wait a few seconds, and just like airpods, we are there. I really like the fact that you instantly see battery life on your headphones in the icon here. So it's just a really seamless experience. So these are red, but the also come in matte black white, procelain rose, blue, and shadow gray; not to be confused with space gray. The shadow gray actually has a nice little gold accent too, so that's kind of nice. Beyond that, what is especially cool with these is I believe they're the first pair of Beats by Dre headphones to include adaptive noise cancellation. With that, you're going to get 22 hours of battery life. But if you want to turn that off into low power mode, you can actually squeeze 40 hours out of these guys. From there though, if you happen to wear these out and blow through that battery life, what's really impressive is 10 minutes of charge time is going to get you 3 hours of playback. So that is crazy cool. Honestly, I think my only complaint with these is the fact that for whatever reason, clearly they are designed to to be used with the iPhone, they are still using a micro USB port. So while USB-C would have been nice, I also would have settled for lightning because that way it would have been one less cable to carry with the iPhone X. The last thing you're probably wondering is how do they sound. Honestly I was surprised with how the sound quality was. I think Beats have kind of become over bashed and over criticized as far as audio quality. But if you check out the reviews I'm not just saying it, there's a lot of people who really enjoy these. Are they the best? Are they audiophile quality headphones, no. But they are very impressive, and they work extremely well with the iPhone X, also 8's and 8+ as well. So last up is actually the smallest product out of the bunch. This is the native union key, actually one of my favorite tech products of all time. It is compact, and I think why I like it the most is because it's on your keychain, unless you are prone to always loosing your keys, you are more than likely going to have a cable with you especially because people like to steal these. So how it works is you have the USB-A version on one side. In this particular case the lightning connector on the other, but they also come in micro-USB as well as USB-C. So whatever phone you have they got you covered. This is a very nice looking navy color. But there's a ton of different variations as well. From there besides the fact that again, it's portable, you're always going to have it on you. I love the aesthetic, I love the build quality, I'll make sure to drop all the variations all the colors to the different models down below. Hopefully you guys enjoyed this video. If you did and you feel like being awesome make sure to smash that like button, and if you missed it we are giving away a brand new X-Box One X. You can check that out here or again down below. This is Jonathan, and I'll catch you guys later. I actually really enjoy Apple's official iPhone X cases.",

    "transcript": "What's up folks. This is another CompTIA Practice Test video where Jeremy and I are gonna try our luck at getting a score higher than our previous score, which in my case was like mid C-range. Think it was like a 76 or something. That is just abysmal. I definitely did not just throw on a hoodie and Greg did not totally just change shirts. Today is several weeks later. Now that you mention it, it's been a good while, a few minutes, I think. Yeah, it's just the nature of YouTube. Anyway, we're gonna start off with another practice test here. And question number one is already a doozy because I don't think I know the answer to it. (laughing) I don't know. Let's give it a shot. Are you ready? Amen. Listen, money's been tight for us (laughing). Wait, that's how you're gonna cue in our sponsor? Yeah, yeah. Stay with us. The Be quiet! Pure Base 500DX is an excellent mid tower optimized for maximum hardware support and performance. With three included 140 millimeter pure wings two fans along with a perforated front panel, you'll experience some of the best airflow in the business. And subtle RGB accents never hurt anything. Choose between black and white and soaking your build through clear tempered glass. Take it from me, you won't be disappointed. Learn more about the Pure Base 500DX from Be quiet! by clicking the link below. So let's jump into that first question. I don't know, man. A POST card. (laughing) What is that? I don't know. Is used for troubleshooting computer startup problems. That sounds like a pretty valid answer choice. Terminates SCSI chain, allows for testing connector pins on the NIC port, is used in biometric authentication. It's a shot in the dark for me. I think I'm going with number one. I'm going with two. You're going two? Don't ask me why, I'm just going with it. Okay, here we go. It sounds like it's making it skip a process. Like when a system POSTs, I mean, I know what that is, so I think that has to do with troubleshoot, I don't know. Number two, which of the following is a common solution for BIOS time and setting resets? CMOS battery replacement, right? Because if your battery dies, that's your internal clock, that's what keeps the clock constant when your system's powered off, so I think that's the answer there. Which of the following could help when troubleshooting a system that attempts to boot to an incorrect device? I'll let you answer this one, Jeremy. You're gonna check your BIOS settings and you're gonna go to your boot order. So that's definitely it, and then you're gonna wanna disconnect any thumb drives. Nice. And good on you for reading the very end of that question, select two answers, because I totally would have missed that just like in the last test. But you are exactly right, my friend, the USB device booting is an issue and then changing boot order. Alrighty, next question. Possible causes for continuous system reboot loops might include. Overheating. Does this mean we can choose more than one answer? There's all the above, baby. Oh, there is. Misconfigured OS, corrupt OS, hardware failure. It Is definitely all the above, yep. Alrighty, question five. I'm feeling pretty good about the first few questions so far, I think we're on a good track. When PC components are not getting enough power, common fixes include disconnecting all extraneous peripheral devices that might be putting too much load on the power supply unit. Reseating the PSU cable connectors inside the computer case and using a PSU tester to check if the power supply is working properly. This sounds like a troubleshooting question. True or false. Sounds pretty true to me. Sounds like whoever in this hypothetical really knows what they're doing. Yeah, reseating the PSU cable connectors. Yeah. To me that makes sense. I would say true. All right. Question six. Which of the following might be caused by excessive dust buildup inside? Okay, if I don't get this one, right, I'm gonna be crucified in the comments. You could have overheating issues, you could have unexpected shutdowns, intermittent device failures, continuous reboots. Can dust cause a system to reboot? If it's overheating, it would reboot, right? True, but is that a- It might just be overheating. That's an effect or a cause. You see what I'm saying? It's like a cause and effect type thing here. I don't know, I've never heard of a system rebooting because of dust but I wouldn't put it past some PCs I've seen. But they're just caked. Why am I getting blue screens? Maybe because your system looks like it came out of a coffin or something. I've got every newspaper for the last 10 years and for whatever reason, my computer reboots because your house is dirty. This is a problem. I don't really know what to say- I'm going with overheating. Just overheating? Yep. I'm gonna go all the above. I'm gonna cover my bases. Wrong, wrong. Wrong but okay. I could be, I'm gonna say it though. All right, here we go. Which hardware components need attention when the issue symptoms on a failing system include loud noises from the inside of the computer case? It's just screaming at you, there's something wrong here. I don't think RAM modules would be one of those, it could be a hard disk drive 'cause that's got spinning discs. Cooling fans, could be that. Analog modem, I don't think so. SSD. PSU can, it has a fan in it, right? No moving parts. Yeah, power supplies usually have moving fans in them. Yeah, I would say two, three and six. Can they do the squealing thing too? What? Power supplies, can't they make like a weird squealing noise? You could have some... Yeah, a coil whine and things, but I'm not sure that's what they're referring to. I think the loud noises are like the bearings and fans going out and then obviously the discs being scratched or whatever inside of a hard disk drive. All right, next question. The Blue Screen of Death in Microsoft Windows provides technical information that might help advanced users to determine the cause of stop error. Information typically displayed on the screen for this type of error includes an error code, the memory address where it occurred, and the name of the driver that caused it. I think that's true. Yeah, it sounds right. Yeah. It would make sense for all those things to be there. Pinwheel is an informal term used for describing stop errors in? Oh God, I don't know. I only know windows. I've never heard of Pinwheel. It's a macOS. It sounds like macOS but- Because it has the colorful one. Ah, yeah, okay. I guess that's it, I'll take your word on it. Which of the following actions might solve the problem of leaking, burst, bulged capacitors inside a computer case? Which might solve the problem? Like replacing the motherboard, like yeah, no, duh (laughing). Central Processing Unit? We need two, we need two. So yeah, good call, we need two. It's gonna be capacitor replacement. So what components have capacitors, like physical capacitors you can see bulging, leaking? Okay, I'm gonna say the bottom two. Here we go. Disc fragmenter is a software tool used to rearrange data on magnetic drives in order to improve system performance. Defragmentation results in faster read/read operations on the magnetic drive's read/right heads because defragmentation consolidates data into the smallest contiguous regions. This means that the heads can access data sequentially without seeking data fragments. That sounds like very, very true. Sounds like that guy knows what he is talking about. Yeah, that sounds- A very elaborate false question. Yeah, very specific false question, right? Next one. An actuator arm assembly failure manifested by loud clicking emitted from the inside of a computer case is a problem symptom that should prompt for... That's gonna be a hard disk replacement, right? First answer. It's not two, it's not three. Faulty primary storage module? What's about that one? That's the same answer. I mean, kinda. What is primary? Does it say primary in the question? How would you know if it was the primary drive or not? What if it's the secondary drive? Yeah, it's too specific, I think it's the first choice. All right, moving on. Question 13, halfway there. Self-Monitoring analysis and reporting technology, S.M.A.R.T, enables monitoring a system for anticipated. I should know this 'cause this is a setting in the BIOS. I don't know this one. I think it's hard disk drive failures, I'm pretty sure. I'm pretty sure it's like S.M.A.R.T storage. I'm pretty sure I've seen S.M.A.R.T and storage in the same lines before in a BIOS so I'm gonna go with hard disk drive failures. Yep. Let's see, the most common and simplest reasons that a computer monitor is unable to display a screen image include. Okay. A bad LCD display, that doesn't seem too farfetched. And then... Oh, this is dumb, dude. Loose cable connections. All of these could be, man. It could be- Wrong and no, it says the simplest. Wrong input selection and loose cable connection. You gotta start with the freaking layer one, baby. Layer one. You always go layer one first. See, you've got that test taking mentality, I've just been so far out of it. I think you're right. So yeah, wrong input- Which side I'm on, baby. What it comes down to, I think, is attention to detail. Like you're reading like keywords in the question that allow you to narrow down the answers they're looking for. Anyone who's taken the CompTIA test, like there you're not looking for the answer you think is the best, you really have to look for like keywords. So yeah, two and four, right? Yeah, 'cause backlight failure is the same thing as bad LCD display basically, that's kind of redundant too. All right, moving on, question 15. The term stuck pixel refers to a tiny spot on an LCD monitor display that permanently remains black when it should be activated in displaying color. That's dead pixel, right? Yeah, I was gonna say a stuck pixel's when it's displaying one type of color. Like if it's like displaying red or green or blue or something like that. It's stuck on a color, it's not stuck off. Off is dead. That's false. Let's see, let's go with false. Yeah. Next one. A dim display on a laptop LCD screen might indicate there's a problem with the back light, right? Yep. Oh, two answers, two answers. Almost missed it, almost missed it. Inverter, maybe. Yeah. As the inverter goes to the... Yeah, 'cause dim- Screen as we learned in the last video. Yeah, yeah, we learned that from the last one, exactly. So yeah, that's the power running through the DC to AC again for the screen, I guess. Yeah, and the others don't make any sense. Let's move on. 17. Which of the following is the name of a permanent computer display screen discoloration caused by displaying the same static image? That's burn-in. Yeah, definitely burn-in. That's an easy one. Someone was telling me that these new OLED TVs get really bad burn-in. That was a thing with some... A lot of TVs with plasma technology got burn-in really bad. Like plasma TV's burn-in really bad. But someone was telling me at work that they like, there's like this $6,000 brand new TV that burns in. Most phones now are OLED screens. Like is your phone stuck with burn-in? Like not really. It's not as common as it used to be. I used to have old OLED AMOLED phones that have burn-in on them, but it took usually a year or two for that to happen. Now, if I took one of like my LG OLED, if I just left like the news on, you know how they have the news ticker on the bottom? If I just left that TV on for like a month straight, like I'm sure there'd be some burn in there 'cause it's the same basic image just kind of glued in. It's 2022, how is burn-in even still a thing? I know, yeah, and we haven't found a cure for cancer either. Which of the following actions may help when troubleshooting a nonresponsive touchscreen on a mobile device? Nonresponsive touchscreen. Reseating the device's battery. Just unplug it and plug it back in. Erasing all content settings and restoring the device to factory defaults. Pressing a specific key combination to perform a system restart. Removing screen protector and cleaning screen. D, right? I don't know, I'm going three. I mean, like is the device stuck, like is it frozen? Like some kind of software lockup 'cause then yeah, soft reset would work. This is nonresponsive. If it's nonresponsive, it could be because yeah, there's like dust under, especially if you have like a screen protector on or if you have gloves on. What do you do if your phone freezes, Greg? Do you clean your screen? (Greg laughing) No? If you're like, dude, my phone's frozen. And then you wipe that off, I'd make fun of you. Okay, all right, good point. Pressing a specific key combination button to perform... Yeah, and this is for mobile phones, right? Yeah, mobile device. Yeah. Yeah, okay. I probably look really stupid there. Let's see, which of the following would help ensure proper reassembly of a serviced mobile device? Using appropriate hand tools, that's for sure. Documenting and labeling screws and locations. A magnetic mat, that's for sure. Removing dust buildup inside the device case. Yeah, I guess. Manufacturer documentation used as a reference. All right, I'm good. All of them, we can say all of them. All of them? What about the dust buildup though, is that gonna affect your ability to reassemble it? I don't know, if it's blocking something from going back in there maybe. Yeah, sort of, yeah. I guess. I'm just gonna go for it. Okay. In laser printing, oh my God, I'm not gonna... Here we go. Oh, Jesus. Long vertical streaks on each output page indicate a problem with. I don't know, I'm gonna go printer calibration, I have no clue though. Long vertical streaks on each output page. A clog print head nozzle? Why would you have... Damage to the imaging drum. Printer driver. Don't even act like you like know any of this stuff. Dude, come on, I can try, all right? A guy can dream. I think it's gonna be damage to the imaging drum. Because if it wasn't calibrated correctly, then wouldn't it just like misalign and stuff? When's the last time Cannon printer's been like, \"Hey Greg, we wanna do a video.\" I don't know, they're not gonna wanna make a video with me after this one. Seeing how little I know about these printers. Which of the following printer problems may be caused by depleted toner? Faded printouts. That's definitely one of them. Garbled characters on printer output pages. Is that... Yeah. No. Ghost images, that sounds like what it would be, right? I think that's like a drum thing 'cause I think that's like when the last part. We're not talking about just laser printers, right? This is any printer, any printer with a toner. I think that's when like a ghost image is like a separate image is printed on your paper. Yeah, it's like a previous... Yeah, from a previous print page. I don't think depleted toner would do that. Printing blank pages, that sounds like one. And then vertical streaks. Oh my gosh, there come the vertical streaks again. I'm going with one and four, dude. One and four? Yeah, okay, I'll do it. 22. Which step of the laser printer imaging process, God dang it, requires troubleshooting... Don't call either of us to fix your fricking printer, that's for sure. Yeah. Requires troubleshooting if a printer produces ghost images, ah, on output pages. I think cleaning, maybe. Or the exposing process. Like I know like with photos, if the image is like from an exposures, I don't know what the heck I'm talking about. Wait, wait, wait, doesn't the printer like charges, it charges the thing and- Dude, you're talking to the wrong guy. I have a fricking basic HP printer in there. I think it charges with the electricity, and then the ink sticks to it where the chargers are. Yeah, yeah, it's magnet inking, right? Yeah, I think it might be charging. I don't know. All right, I'm going with charging, it's better guess than I had. 23, oh, dang it. In laser printing, toner falling off of a printed copy indicates a problem with the following. Toner cartridge. What? I don't even understand the question. Yeah, I- Oh. I'm just gonna confess something right now, I have no clue what toner even is. I just know that people need toner replaced in printers, but I don't know what it is or what it does (laughing). I think it's the, well, it is like the ink, right? But I think it's the one that is magnetically charged to the paper. So if toner falls off, then there's a problem with the toner cartridge which has the ink in it, if that's what it is? I'm gonna go fuser assembly, but you can go with wherever you want. I'm going toner cartridge, I'm gonna go with the obvious. I don't know. All right, garbled characters on output page. Dude, why are we getting slammed, absolutely slammed with printer questions? I wasn't say anything, this is why I failed. This is why I failed. Dude, I was doing- 'Cause I was like, I know about computers, and I went in and there was like 30 printer questions. So bad. Garbled characters on output pages may indicate a printing problem related to which of the following? Garbled characters. I'm not even gonna bother trying to think these through. I'm gonna go with that as well. I legit, I don't know. Oh, here we go, here we go. IPv4 address within the range of 169.254.0.1 through 169.254.255.254 indicates a problem with what type of service? DNS? Shot in the dark here, I'm not a network guy, I don't know. You should know this. You should know this. Oh, wait, it's DHCP. DHCP? Okay. Just learned this, baby. I just learned this in CCNA. I'm pretty sure it's one of the DHCP. Do you know what DHCP stands for? Yes, it's dynamic- Domain hosting or dynamic. Domain... Dynamic... I don't know, I used to- Hosting something protocol, I don't know. Dynamic host controller protocol? That sounds legit. That's right. I should know this. I know that. This is the one I'm actually gonna get roasted for in the comments. All right, so let's click Finish here and see how bad we did (laughing). This is not gonna be good. Wow, the first one we missed. Oh, let's go down to the bottom here. Oh dude, I got an 86? I got an 80. I feel like you're definitely... Dude, I literally got so lucky on that. Like you saved my butt on at least a few questions, 'cause there's no way I did that on my own. There's no way. We got all these beginning questions right, including that POST card thing about troubleshooting computer startup. I got that one, so that's the one you missed, right? Yeah. Yeah. Let's see the next one. Which of the following actions might solve the problem of leaking bulged capacitors? They wanted a capacitor replacement and motherboard. They're assuming that there's only capacitors on motherboards. Yeah, that question was dumb. I got capacitor replacement right though, and you got motherboard replacement right, didn't you? Yeah, I did. So we each got one right on that one out of two. It says leaking or it could be leaking inside a computer case so maybe they meant like- Because it's exposed, like in a power supply it's closed off. Yeah, yeah, it's closed off. Which of the following actions may help when troubleshooting a non-responsive touch screen? We said pressing a specific key combination to perform a soft reset. Dude, you gave me so much crap for this question (laughing). You guilted me. It is a dumb answer. That's a dumb answer, no wrong. You guilted me into not selecting for granted. I still would've been wrong here, but you told me that there was no way that anyone was gonna wipe on their screen- Go resit the battery on my model Samsung phone. Just clean it off if it's locked up. I'm just saying, an impression that you might get when the screen isn't responding is that, okay, maybe I'm not touching it correctly, maybe there's something preventing the screen from picking up my touch, that was why I thought that. I also could see how it could be answer three like we said, reseating a device's battery is a bit of a barbaric take. That's like early 2000s fixing there, I guess. And then erasing all content settings and restoring the device to factory defaults (laughing). It's probably all the picture of my family, that's probably what's causing, I should remove it. Yeah, get rid of all your precious family pics. They want you to nuke your whole device if your screen freezes. Dude, I don't see that as being a solution, I guess it's like scorched earth mentality here, but that one, I have a bone to pick with that one. The next one we missed as well. Which of the following would help ensure proper reassembly of a serviced mobile device? Oh man, no, that's my fault. Dude. The dust... Okay, I just brought it up, right? Just hypothetically, dust shouldn't really affect your ability to reassemble something unless... But like you said, if it's a ton of dust, it could. So I think that's kind of a... They just threw that in there just to prevent people from getting perfect scores, I feel like, 'cause that's really, I don't know. Okay, here's where we missed all of our laser printer questions. Which step of the laser printer imaging process requires troubleshooting if you have ghost images? So we said charging and the answer was cleaning. Wait, which one? Which question is that? The depleted toner question? No, ghost images. Next one, toner falling off of a printed image, printed copy. I said toner cartridge, the answer was fuser assembly. We answered different, this is why you need to answer the same as me, we have to agree on the answers in the future 'cause you're looking at different- I got a fuser assembly. Questions you got wrong. I was right. Garbled characters on output pages may indicate a printing problem related to which of the following? I said calibration, the answer was printer driver. Are you kidding me? A freaking driver. Ah, man. I was right about the DHCP one at least. Hold on. So success ratio is 76%, but your percentage secured is 85.71. Does this like make any sense? I think because there's like multiple- I think it's because it counts to multiple choice, yeah. When there's multiple answers and you get like two of the three right, I guess it weighs 'em that way. My raw score, if you just base it on, did he get the question right fully or not, was 76, which means I still passed. I think CompTIA does the simpler one where it's just like, they'll give you a few points. Yeah. Yeah, so percentage secured was 85. All right, well that's not bad, It could have been a lot worse. Those printer questions at the end, they really tried to get us there. We haven't failed yet, Jeremy, I think that's really saying something. So you use to get degrees, baby. That's right. Hey, at this point I'm happy with just passing because we haven't really studied at all for these and we're just kind of relying on our industry knowledge on what little of it we might have to get us through, and so far it's worked out. So I'm happy with that result. I feel like we did fairly well and I'm kind of looking forward to the next one, dude. These are kind of fun. I like knowing what I understand and what I don't, and this has been humbling and it's also been pretty enlightening too. Hopefully it has been for our viewers as well, especially if you're younger, interested in taking tests like this, getting certs before you maybe take up a trade or go to college or I don't know, try to land some jobs somewhere. Certs like these can come in handy. I think of them like college degrees. Like sometimes you just have to have the paper in hand to even be considered for the job. And so maybe there's some value out there for other folks who might be interested in picking something up like this. I don't think I'm gonna, unless I have to, but I don't know. Jeremy, you have a few of 'em, right? Which ones do you have? Yeah, man, I think I'm gonna start a discord, not a discord channel, but just a, what's it called? A text channel in your discord maybe, and see if we can get some people some help with certs. 'Cause I mean, it's super competitive with degrees, like pay wise. You can get one cert and be making $60,000 a year. It's possible. Like these certs will get you a job. Wow, all right. Then with that in mind, yeah, maybe we'll get that going. You guys sure to check out our discord server, it is free, it is public, it's linked in the video description. You can also take some of these tests along with this if you want. We've linked this little webpage here that has a bunch of different CompTIA tests and other tests as well if you are interested. And I think that's about it, are we ready to get outta here? Think so. Let's do it. With our scores in hand, we have passed, we're ready to take test number three at some point here in the near future, depending on how the viewership goes. If you guys are interested in seeing more of this stuff, let us know in the comment section below. Thanks for watching this part of the video. My name's Greg, his name is... Jeremy. That was such an epic plug. Thanks for- That's 'cause you go, my name is. You go, his name is- Well, you know that I'm leading up to it, so it's just like there shouldn't be as big a delay there because then it just feels clunky to the viewer. I can edit it. No, then it's gonna feel choppy. There's a certain kind of harmony that you- Maybe your edits. Maybe your edits feel choppy. Thanks for learning with us. Thanks for ruining the end of the video, Jeremy, appreciate it. I'm too stubborn to refilm.",

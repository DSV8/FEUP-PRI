    "transcript": "- Hello and welcome to \"This Is.\" I think it's safe to say that I'm a big old husky boy who loves his fast food, but I'm curious, Austin. - Yeah. - What do you think about fast food chains across these continental United States? - I'd love to tell you more with a tier list. So we have listed, actually, how many do we have? One, two, 21, 22, these- - 22, we have 22 of America's most common fast food restaurants. - Let's get started. - Yes, okay. - Arby's. - Arby's. - [Austin] C, easy. - [Matt] C? - So okay, look, here's the thing. Arby's makes a delicious Jamoca shake, right? I will fully get on board with that. - Who goes to Arby's to get a shake? - Let Matt know he's wrong in the comments below, okay? - I'm not going to argue with that. I actually really didn't like Arby's until I switched my order to getting chicken from Arby's. I'll give you the C. I'm not saying it's amazing. - Okay, okay. - Burger King. - Burger King's actually a little tough for me. - I used to love Burger King. - [Austin] Same. They put too much stuff on the burger. Like too much mayonnaise or ketchup or whatever. There's always too much sauce on my burger. - If your burger needs ketchup, if your burger needs mayonnaise, it's a bad burger. Saying B. - B for Burger King. - All right. How about Little Caesars? I think D at best. - I agree. - Like it just- - I don't think it's an F, because I'll eat some Little Caesars. It's not terrible. - [Matt] I really will only eat the Crazy Bread. - Yeah, I won't go out of my way. I say D. Next up we have Carl's Jr./Hardee's based on where you live in the United States. - I think it's fine. I don't think it's bad. So, I mean, to me, that's a C? - I would 100% agree. I think a C for Carl's Jr./Hardee's. Next up, we have an S rank which is Chick-fil-A. The end. Thank you very much for attending my TED Talk. Chick-fil-A S. Look, there's no question in my mind that Chick-fil-A is the gold standard of fast food. Chick-fil-A is great, it gets you in and out. They have few ingredients, but everything they do is good. I hate a menu that has a hundred different items on it that like 95 of them are terrible. Chick-fil-A, easy win. If only they were open more than six days a week. Next up, another restaurant, which I think is a clear S rank contender is Chipotle. - I'm going to give you S tier on that. I want Chipotle as soon as we finish this video. - I would agree. - So we just agreed on what we're having for lunch. - The thing is with Chipotle, Chipotle for me seems like it is a bit healthier, mostly because you get to customize it a little bit more. Chipotle, great. And along with your point about how fast it is, I feel like Chipotle pretty regularly, no matter where I go to it, is I'm in and out fast. - Next up we have Domino's. Now, this was one that you, if you had asked me 10 years ago- - Yep. - I would've told you F. Because I remember, all right, I'm going to rant about this for a second. - Uncle Matt coming in hot with the story right now. - Domino's used to be literally the worst pizza. It was cardboard with ketchup on it. And one day they just had like this whole ad campaign which some of you might remember, where it was like, \"You know what, what if we made good pizza?\" (Austin laughing) And then they just did. - First of all, I think they actually do online ordering probably the best out of any sort of pizza. - [Matt] They arguably are the biggest tech, like, driven fast food restaurant. I'm giving them an A. - I will agree. I think A is very solid. - Here's one that I have very little experience with. - Okay. - In fact, it's Dairy Queen. - Let me fill you in, right? So I grew up going to Dairy Queen. This was the birthday hangout spot- - [Matt] Really? - If you can believe, when I was a kid, everyone would go over to Dairy Queen for their birthdays. So Dairy Queen, as the name implies, serves not only ice cream, but also burgers and whatnot. Dairy Queen has decent ice cream. They've got the Blizzard. Everyone likes a Blizzard. - Dump the- - Upside down, yup, yup, or it's free. The burgers are decent. I think Dairy Queen is a solid mid-range contender. I would say it's a C tier. - C? Okay, I'll take that. This is one that gets a lot of controversy. - Ooh, Five Guys is a tough one. First of all, I think Five Guys has some of the most delicious burgers that you can get at any kind of fast food. Like, like you said, with the price, I think calling Five Guys fast food is almost not quite accurate. It almost feels like it's like a fast casual kind of like, look, to be fair, Chipotle was kind of the same thing. But like, it almost feels like it's a tier up in price and in sort of experience. I will agree, though, B. I think Five Guys, probably an S tier for flavor, but for health and for every other aspect, it's a little lower. So B seems reasonable. Now, Matt, I gotta hit you. I gotta hit you with the most controversial one in this entire video. In and Out Burger. - Overrated. - Whoo! - I, like, it's a good burger. - Okay, go ahead. - Like, I've never been disappointed by In and Out Burger. So there's, every time you go, it's these massive lines, and I've never once waited in that line and been like, \"You know what? I'm glad I waited in this line.\" I'm giving it a B. Ooh, I think A. I think it needs an A. - I'm gonna, I'm gonna fight you on this one. Okay, do we settle this with rock paper scissors? Don't do rock. Rock, paper, scissors. - Rock, paper, scissors. - [Austin] You go one, two, three. - I won, so it's a B. - You see what I have to deal with? - The next one is my dark horse. - Really? - Like, if I can't decide on where to, what I want, I go to Jack in the Box. I'm like, I'm not going to say it's like S tier. I'm not even going to say it's A tier. - [Austin] Okay, good, thank you. - If I never know what I want, that has a little bit of everything, and I can like, if I don't, I don't know if I want chicken, I don't know if I want a burger, I don't know if I want tacos. Jack in the Box, I'm going to say B. - Way too high. I was thinking D. I can meet you in the middle of this at a C. - [Matt] All right, I'll say C. - Okay, okay. Next up, the Colonel's finest fried chicken from the great state of Kentucky. I have a special place in my chicken-filled heart for some Colonel goodness. I love some KFC. I think KFC delivers solid chicken. And I think unlike pretty much any of the other chicken restaurants on this list, including Chick-fil-A, I think KFC deserves a very, very strong B. Now this is going to be a spicy one. Mac Day-neld. Is that how you say that? It's an American restaurant. I actually think out of everything on this list, with the probable exception of like Chick-fil-A, but that's so limited because they have such a focus on quality control, for like a very broadly available fast food chain, McDonald's does a very good job of quality control. - Yes. - I know that no matter where I am in the entire world, I can order myself a Big Mac and it's great. McDonald's has a level of consistency. It's like the definition of a safe answer. McDonald's is like the place that, like, if you say, \"Austin, you can only eat at one restaurant for the rest of your life.\" Right? Keeping in mind, not necessarily just pure quality, but like the availability of these restaurants and everything like that. McDonald's is going to be pretty high on that list. But now I'm looking at our tier list and I'm like, wait, are we putting KFC, In and Out, Five Guys on the same as McDonald's and Burger King? - [Matt] I want to take Burger King out and put it on a C. - [Austin] So we're gonna move Burger King down to C, and we're gonna move McDonald's up to a B? - [Matt] Bam. - If you're filling this out at home, and you're probably not, 'cause you're watching YouTube video and you're not paying attention. Take a look at our tier list right now. We still have quite a few restaurants on it. What do you disagree with the most? Let us know in the comments below, because I, now I'm looking at this, we may, at the end, I may want to move some things around. But not before we get to our next item, which is... - Panda Express. - The only Chinese food on this entire list, actually, huh? - [Matt] Fun fact, though, it used to be owned by McDonald's. Also Chipotle used to be- - [Austin] Chipotle, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's just, it's average, right? - [Matt] Yes. - [Austin] I just feel like there's better ways to do... - [Matt] It's good for lunch. I wouldn't want to go there for dinner. - And also it feels like Panda is one of the more unhealthy things? - Oh, very unhealthy. Their greens are just swimming in butter. - Yeah, which tastes decent. - Tastes good because it's butter. Butter is delicious, but like... - I'd struggle on this one. I would say a C or a D. - [Matt] I'm gonna say C. - You see, okay, I'll accept that C. - For the same reason we said, you know, McDonald's is a B, I go to any Panda, I know what I'm getting. - It's fine. It's just, it feels like there's a better version of Panda Express that should exist. - Papa John's. - Oh! - The Papa himself said the day of reckoning is upon us. It was coming. But I think it is upon us. I'm giving... - Go ahead. - [Matt] I had Papa John's, I've given them so many opportunities. - Yeah, say it. - I'm actually giving Papa John's an F. - F, agreed. - It's, I... - Papa John's is not good. No one should eat Papa John's. Why would you do that? - The one thing that Papa John's does- - [Austin] Go ahead. - Is the cheese sticks. You know how hard it is to (beep) up just dough and cheese? (Austin laughing) It's an F. It's terrible. This is one that's gonna be tough for me, very tough for me. - [Austin] Go ahead. - Is Pizza Hut. - Book it. 90s kids know what's up. - Yeah. So what he's referring to is summer reading, if you read enough books, you would get a personal pan pizza. - [Austin] And a little like medal. - Yep. Now the other 90s thing is most Pizza Huts used to be sit-down restaurants. - So when I grew up, so I grew up in a really tiny little town. That would be a thing. Like we would go out to dinner with my grandma. They would have like the salad bar, fun fact. - [Matt] It was really good. - They used to be the number one, like, purchaser of kale in the entire United States was like to decorate the Pizza Hut salad bars. But Pizza Hut was good, right? You could get the buffet. You could go order in. It was absolutely a sit-down restaurant. - My family went every Friday for like a decade. - [Austin] Yeah. - You know, like, and they bring out the pizza. They would actually, like, the server would actually serve you the slice. Like, it was really good. And it's been so downhill. - Here's the thing with Pizza Hut. If Domino's wasn't great, Pizza Hut would be higher on this list. But the problem is, there are probably just about as many Pizza Huts as there are Domino's, and Domino's is just simply better, which I think by definition means if you're not one of if not the best of your type of fast food, why would you deserve to be high on this list? I think we've gotta go with C for Pizza Hut. - I'm going to go D. - No, no, D is too bad. - I'm gonna go D. And I'm putting Pizza Hut at D. Here's one you're going to take over. 'Cause I've only been here once, and that was with you. Popeye's. - [Austin] Popeye's is good. I like some Popeye's. - [Matt] I've literally, the only time I've ever had Popeye's, 'cause again, just, there wasn't a ton where I was. - [Austin] Yeah. - [Matt] And same thing. I just never really went for like a bucket of chicken. - [Austin] Dude, the chicken sandwiches are legit. I will say Popeye's is a pretty firm B for me. I think Popeye's is solid. It's really, really solid. - [Matt] I'm gonna have to defer to you on that. - I will say Popeye's and KFC, I would go to interchangeably. Obviously I get slightly different things from each, but like I enjoy both of them quite a lot. Another one that I have a lot of personal experience for, Sonic. Sonic Drive-in. Now, if you've never experienced Sonic, essentially there are a couple of different types of Sonic. There is a version which is a drive-through is very standard and boring. And then there's ones where they actually you have like the drive-up service. You know, you push the little button, you order into like your own little stall, and then people on roller skates bring your food out. I will say Sonic food is probably a B or a C or so, but the experience of going to a Sonic, getting like a Limeade, mm, beautiful. I say it's a very firm B to me. - [Matt] I'll give it to you. - [Austin] I want Sonic now. - This is one where we are going to fight over. Subway. I personally think Subway is F tier. - [Austin] No, not, you can't have- - Every Subway- - Oh, Matt. - [Matt] Tastes like Subway. Why? Like, why does the Coke I get from a Subway taste like Subway? (Austin laughing) And like, again, I've eaten Subway all over the place, but why does it always smell like just window fluid and yeast? - Okay, okay, okay, stop, stop, stop. - [Matt] You wanna go there all the time. - That's enough. - He wants to go there like at least once or twice a week, he's like, \"Oh let's just walk over to Subway.\" There's like four other great sandwich places around here. - Okay, okay, okay. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Let me defend your shameless slander of a delicious restaurant where you can eat fresh for $5.99 or for $4.99 or whatever they do now. - Delicious and restaurant are both words that should not be used to describe Subway. - I can't okay, I'll rock, paper, scissors you on this. 'Cause I'm not taking F for an answer. All right. Now one, two, and then we shoot on three. So you have to go down on three. - Okay. - Ready, set, go. - One, two... - Boom, D tier, let's go. - All right. All right, how do you feel, you know how you feel about- - We do. - I'm surprised you're not wearing one right now. Taco Bell. - A tier, easy. - Taco Bell's amazing. - [Austin] Taco Bell is great. And importantly, has a lot more disgusting stuff than I actually want to eat, right? Doritos tacos were the greatest invention of the 21st century. - This one's gonna be, this one, you know, I think it's just, I think it's A tier. - Whoa, you're going straight to A tier for Wendy's? - [Matt] I'm going straight- - Ooh, okay, pitch me. Why does Wendy's deserve an A tier? - [Matt] Never had a bad meal from Wendy's. - Okay, but hang on. Let's just work backwards from your statement here. So you're going to say Wendy's is better than In and Out, better than Five Guys, KFC, McDonald's, Popeye's, and Sonic? - [Matt] Yes, because it's also cheap. If you're going to ask me McDonald's or Wendy's I'm going to pick Wendy's 100% of the time. - I still think A is a little bit too good for Wendy's, okay? But your argument is persuasive. I will say that Wendy's has never really let me down. It is above average, which is fine. This brings us to the final item on our fast food tier list. Now, Matt, we discussed this before shooting the video. You've never had White Castle nor Krystal. - No, I've had White Castle. - [Austin] Oh, you have had White Castle. - Yes. I've never been to a White Castle that wasn't actively a crime scene. I've been robbed three times in my life. - Okay, go ahead. - Two of them were in East Rutherford, New Jersey, and one of them was outside the White Castle in East Rutherford, New Jersey. - [Austin] The burgers are delicious, right? - [Matt] Are they? - [Austin] I can inhale six Krystal Burgers in like 15 seconds. D tier. I will give you D tier, but not F F F F F. All right, all right, all right. Rock, paper, scissors. All right. - No, you said three. - Rock, paper, scissors. That's one, two, and then three. - One, two, three, go. - No! - That's how people play it. Jamie, run the footage back. - Who counts to two? - Run the footage back. Two, and then we shoot on three, so you have to go down on three. - Thank you so much for watching this episode of \"This Is.\" If you want us to do- - Moving to D tier, it's in D tier. - What? If you want us to do more of these videos, let us know. If you want to tell us how wrong we are on these, let us know in the comments alone. - Specifically Matt. - Alone, what? - We're all alone, Matt. And we're really hungry. 'Cause I'm looking at this to list, and I would take anything on this tier list right now, I'm so hungry. - Except Subway.",

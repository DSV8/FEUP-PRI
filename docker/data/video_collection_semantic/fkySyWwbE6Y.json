    "transcript": "hello good people I'm Dimitri and mobile gaming it's probably something that none of us or probably many of us don't want to talk about but I think we have to face the reality it is expanding as on the ecosystem many companies are trying to push different products that will improve the overall experience and I guess we all have to face the fact and accept that mobile gaming in the future is going to be pretty big you look around literally anywhere someone is on their phone playing a mobile game none of them are competitive gamers but with services like Microsoft x cloud and videos GeForce now and yes even Google's terrible Stadium there is an opportunity to play something other than crappy ad loaded mobile games but not to worry none of them will take over PC gaming any time soon but there is an opportunity for high bandwidth 5g connections that will improve the overall user experience sure you will munch through your mobile data in no time however we can all agree that low latency mobile gaming is coming and so with that in mind razer is designing a whole ecosystem for that exact purpose but first I'd like to thank thermaltake be quiet Razer and FedEx for sponsoring our CES coverage so the first piece of this whole 5g network mobile puzzle is Razer's Sila router so this thing is still in early prototype stages but the idea is that it will take high bandwidth mobile 5g connection and distributed through a multi-channel Wi-Fi 6 network honestly taking a wireless signal and converting it into a different Wireless band sounds like a pretty bad idea to me but I think I get what Razer is trying to do since 5g connections technically can achieve a hundred gigabytes per second speeds which are faster than most landline connections you could take advantage of that mobile speed connection and use that in conjunction with mobile gaming in particular when you stream in mobile and have low latency connection with high speeds and other possibilities to maybe use razer Sila to bypass slow hotel speeds if you have a good mobile plan that way you could maybe stream and upload content without relying on the terrible connections that we outside of the studio and so Sila would give me a burr and Mike a Good Wifi 6 router Network we just pop in the SIM card with good mobile data and we can all share that speed that would give us a low latency fast connection and no reliability on something that we can't really control that of course means we have no data caps but I guess we can dream maybe the future that would be the reality now since this whole thing is still in prototype phases there's not really much talk about the exterior other than it looks like a UE boom speaker with a few razor touches it's black with a bit of green on the globe and around back there's a USB 3.0 port in case you want to plug in external storage drives three LAN ports and a single when input there's also an internal SIM card slot that will probably move somewhere closer to the back for easier access that means it can either be used in Wired mode as a standard home router or be used with the sim card and 4G or 5g s down the line razors next step towards rounding out this whole mobile gaming ecosystem is what they call Razer Kishi or as we with the guys like to call Razer kimchee my god these names so this thing is a mobile controller that clips onto pretty much any iPhone or Android phone provided it has a USB C or Apple lightning connector unfortunately it sounds like there are two separate devices for Android and iOS instead of being able to replace the actual cable why but basically razer took all their learnings from Razer's phone to jungle cat controller to create this thing and from our short time with it the kishi or the kimchi actually feels pretty awesome the triggers are well placed and they have excellent feedback and even with bigger phones installed the whole thing never felt too bulky it's also really well contoured for a huge range of hand sizes and both mic and even prefer the Kishi controller over the Nvidia controller and even over the ps4 controller I did find forward and back buttons to be awkwardly placed but other than that it's a pretty good handheld experience to install a smart phone all you have to do is stretch open the grips secure them into place and most controller enabled games should recognize it it offers pasture charging - even though there isn't an incorporated battery and since it's a wired connection latency should be pretty much eliminated now personally I'm not a family trollers I'm over keyboard and mouse type of guy and I never play on mobile devices but with official support with GeForce now and cloud X you could potentially get away playing some more serious games on that thing all right so that's it from Razer let us know what you think about this whole 5g mobile network ecosystem development and if Razer is making products for it there must be a market for it as well im3 tree thanks for watching I'll talk to you guys in the next video",

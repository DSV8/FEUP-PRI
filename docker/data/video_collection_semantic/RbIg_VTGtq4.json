    "transcript": "An electronic Tesla Car can do 250 miles before needing to be recharged. This electronic bike can do 20 miles before needing to be recharged; 40 miles if you help the motor by pedaling. Now Rad Power Bikes, told me that this bike can do 20 miles an hour, which is incredibly fast. Legally, it cant go faster than that, in order to stay on the road. You know 'street legal'. So today we are going to try this bike out in the snow, because of these super huge tires. I am going to check the top speed with my drone. Which has a GPS in it. And then afterward... even though Rad Bikes didnt actually tell me I could take this thing apart, I'm going to show you whats inside of this battery compartment. To see how similar it is to 'Tesla'. Lets get started. [Music] This thing seriously takes all of the hard work out of Mountain biking, and leaves just the fun stuff. Lets see whats inside of this battery. This is probably the biggest battery I have ever taken apart on my channel. You can see the power button, and locking key latch, along with the lifting handle that pulls it out of the holster. Both The Tesla Model S and this Rad Power Bike are using Panasonic Cells in their batteries, so itll be interesting to see what it looks like on the inside. Over here we have a battery level indicator, The charging port, and a USB slot. Over on the left hand side we have a 30 Amp fuse which normally just see on cars. So its interesting to see it here on my bike. Opening up batteries like this is actually kind of dangerous. Lithium is hazardous and should never be punctured, sawed, hammered, you get the idea. The average person will never need to open up their battery. The power connector has your normal positive and negative leads, and then 6 long screws hold the plastic halves together. I did end up checking the top speed of this bike with my drone, and it was 20 mph. Which is also what it also says on the bike speedometer. So not too much of a surprise. There are two warranty void stickers on either side of the battery housing. I usually eat these for breakfast. And now we can see what powers this thing. Inside the plastic housing is a 48 volt 11.6 Ah battery. For reference an iPhone 7 is a 3.8 volt 1.1 Ah battery. You can see that the giant blue chunk is actually made up of little cylinders all wired together. Exactly the same way that the Tesla car batteries are manufactured. Tons of little batteries all wired together to make one big battery. There are a bunch of wires and a circuit board up at the top, and I imagine that these are all part of the battery protection circuit that prevents overcharging. I also like how everything has the white caulk around the connectors. While this housing is in no way water proof, that white rubber stuff will help keep the water out, and the connectors in place while you are riding. The bottom plug also has a rubber ring, Probably to minimize vibration, and to keep water out of the battery shell. Well, if you cant afford a Tesla, this bike could very well be a good backup plan. I did talk to Rad Power Bikes, and they said they would drop their price 50$ dollars for my subscribers. So Ill leave a link in the video description right below this video, if you are into that kinda thing. If anyone has a Tesla that I can take apart, feel free to send it over. You know. For science. Thanks a ton for watching! Ill see you around.",

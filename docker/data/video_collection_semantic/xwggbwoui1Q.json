    "transcript": "(upbeat electric music) - So, Jeremy, from version 2.2 of GNS3, you made a lot of changes. So, one of those changes, and I just wanna emphasize for everyone watching, this is not just for 2.2, it's from version 2.2. So, from version 2.2 of GNS3, one of the big changes, that I really like, is this link detection options. So it's gonna detect when something happens in GNS3, is that correct? - This is correct. So, for instance, if you interconnect two nodes, like R1 and R2, and you pause a link, or you delete the link, then the routers will know the link has been deleted or paused. - In previous releases of GNS3, if I did a \"Show IP Interface\" brief, let's say on a CISCO router as an example. It would see this as UP, UP even when I've deleted the link, yeah? - Exactly, yes. - And on the same on this side, so they see it as UP, UP, but in this version with Link Detection GNS3's doing something to inform the operating systems, is that right? So like, if I'm running IOSv here, it's telling the operating system that the link has gone down, so this will go UP, DOWN. - Exactly, yes, - Or DOWN, DOWN, depending on the device, yeah? - Yes, and this is really important for to test protocol conversions, so, for instance, you have OSPF between those two devices. So OSPF will be informed that the link has been cut. - Yeah, so as an example, if you had G0/0 and G0/1 here just as an example, and you removed that link in GNS3 the devices will know that that's gone down, and then they'll converge across say, another link? - Exactly, yeah. Instead of waiting for the timeout. - Yeah'cause that was a big problem at first. - there's always a timeout, but you have to wait. I don't remember for SPS, but-- - Yeah, it just depends on the interface Yeah it takes a while. Yeah, the dead, based on the dead time of the protocol. And I mean, like with BFD and other protocols because, well let me ask you the question how quick is this detection. Is it almost instant? - This is almost instant, yes. - As soon as you cut the link we inform the server and then it's done. - Well, that's brilliant. I mean, again, so if you're doing protocol testing with OSPF or even Spanning Tree, stuff like that? - Spanning Tree, everything that needs to know the status of a link. - And that's, yeah, as soon as the link goes down. So, just so everyone's aware, this is both for suspend and for deleting a link, yeah? - Yes. - So if I physically go into GNS3, and I remove that link but what's the... Sorry, go on. - Yes, one important information here. This will only work with QEMU and VirtualBox - So when you-- - So if you use Dynamips this is not going to work 'cause we can not tell Dynamips that the link has been cut or paused. - Okay so it's QEMU and VritualBox. - Yes. - So those work, Dynamips doesn't work - Dynamips does not work. So it will work if you use the viral images with QEMU. This is not going to work if you use any classic IOS image with Dynamips. - Like a 7200 won't work? - No, this is not going to work. - But IOSv will work? - IOSv, IOSvL2 all the appliances running on QEMU, this is going to work. - But this is an interesting one, VirtualBox. - VirtualBox - What about the VMware? - No, VMware I don't think we support it because we have no way to tell VMware about the links status. - Okay so in other words. If you added devices to your topology, this like, let's say its a Windows PC. That would have to run a VirtualBox for this feature to work? - Yes. - But does it work with Docker? - With Docker... I will have to check I don't remember. (laughs) - That's okay, so-- - I think we support it with Docker. - So what I'll do, I'll add a video below this talking about Docker because that would be great with Docker. I must actually test that because then you, with Docker you don't have this you don't have to have a heavy operating system. - Yes. - And VPC, VPCS? - No no no not VPCS, no. - So it's only QEMU, VirtualBoxand perhaps Docker which we'll check, yeah? - Yes. - Brilliant! Anything else to say about this feature? - No I think that's everything. - Great. So what about another feature? Another big one I heard about is is Hyper-V. What is that about? - So Hyper-V so, we have Hyper-V support from version 2.2. So it basically means you can run the GNS3 VM in Hyper-V on windows. And you have some restrictions here. So you can only run in Windows 10 anniversary edition or later. Or Windows server 2016 or later. - That's the first restriction. And the second restriction is you have to use Intel processors. Like your system has to run on the hardware with Intel processors. - So at the moment, and that could change but a the moment-- - Yes - Microsoft might decide they want to support the ND as well They might do it later, or not. We have no control on this. - Okay so just so that I understand. The reason why Hyper-V only works with Intel is because of nested virtualization? - Because of nested virtualization. - So nested virtualization is only supported with Hyper-V on Intel processors. That's a Microsoft thing that's not a GNS3 thing. - No that's not a GNS3 thing. - So the advantage here, if I draw this again is I have a Windows computer and I'm running Windows as my operating system. Now I run the GNS3 VM directly within Hyper-V on Windows. - Yes. - Rather than having to install the GNS3 VM inside VirtualBox on Windows? Ad it's native? - Yeah, it's native. So as I say, Windows 10 I think or a version of Windows 10 support Hyper-V. And of course several editions of Windows also support Hyper-V. - But the two big problems is it must be an Intel Processor - That's the main restriction. - And it has to be a specific version of Windows. - Yes. - And you, well another one actually is it, your BIOS, you have to go into the BIOS and enable nested virtualization. - No... yes, you have to enable nested virtualization. - With Hyper-V yeah? - With Hyper-V, yes. - Okay, great. Anything else to say about Hyper-V? So at 2.2... is it experimental or is it a feature? - It's still experimental. Everything should work the same as if you run the GNS3 VM. With VMware or VirtualBox. Accepting there may be some issues. Like we heard if you run IOU and QEMU at the same time in the GNS3 VM with Hyper-V then the VM will crash. - Okay so that's a problem in 2.2 so depending on when you're watching this it could be fixed, like 2.3 or something. - It could be fixed. We don't why has the VM crashed but that's the situation. - Yeah that's something for later. It could be fixed but we don't know at the moment, yeah? - Yep. - Okay great. So that's Hyper-V. One of the big features that came out in 2.2 and depending again, when people are watching this, is the Web Ui. So what is that and why is nice? - So the Web Ui will eventually replace the exe.ui - But in version 2.2 the Web Ui is read only. And maybe you will be able to move nodes. Start a node, stop a node but we don't support console yet. - So there's no console in Web Ui in version 2.2? - In 2.2 it will come after version 2.2. - So that may, I mean its... At the time of this recording we're not sure but depending when you watch this it could come in 2.3 - Yes. - Or later, yeah? - The goal is 2.3 or another version, is to have a full version of the Web Ui. - Okay great so just so that everyone understands we currently have, before 2.2 we have a Windows GUI executable as an example on a Mac we have DMG we have an application on Linux as well this is like what I like to call the fat client or the thick client whatever you want to call it. That may eventually go away and be replaced with this yeah? - Yes it's not going to happen tomorrow or any time soon it could take a few years. But eventually what we would like to do is have only the Web Ui. - Okay so eventually Web Ui. 2.2 is read only but you can enable experimental features? - You can enable experimental features. - And then you can move nodes around? - And you can move nodes around - Create links? - Create links, create nodes, do a few actions like this. But the Web Ui in 2.2 is more to show what we've been working on, what's coming. You can play with it, but it's not going to replace fat client yet. - Okay great. Okay what other feature have we got in 2.2 or from 2.2 that you want to talk about? - We have a new GNS3 VM. - Yeah lets talk about. So another one that we've got is the GNS3 VM changes doesn't it? - Yes we have updated GNS3 VM. Especially we've upgraded the operating system which is UBUNTU 18.04. - Okay so we've moved from... what was it before? - It was UBUNTU 16.04. - Okay so 16.04, that was in version 2.1? - Yes. - And then this is version 2.2. - Exacy. We also made some improvements. You can upgrade to any GNS3 version you want. Like you say \"oh I only want version 2.2.1\" you can select that in the list. - Okay, can you upgrade your current GNS3 VM to this VM? - No, you cannot upgrade. You will have to download the GS3 VM for version 2.2. - Yep migrate all your projects, images all the the GNS3 data from one VM to another. - So basically you have 2.1 in a VM, 2.2 in VM, you have both VMs running at the same time - Yes. - And then you've got a migration tool. - Yes. Yeah? - Yes. - And then I think you mentioned there's two ways to do it. You can do something with a-- - Also another way is to take the virtual disc from one VM and attach it to the other VM. - So you would shut this one down? - Yes. - And then you would do a move of the-- - Yeah you will basically copy the file to the other VM - And then attach it to that yeah? - Yeah. - Otherwise what you do is you have both running and you go into the GNS3 menu on this VM is that right? - Yep. - And then you select an option that says \"migrate data\" and then you need to give the IP address of that guy? - Exactly, yes. - And then it copies it across somehow. - Yes across a network or locally. - Or locally yeah? - That's great.

    "transcript": "good people I'm Dimitri and my gaming setup has changed quite a lot in the past few months I've replaced the Razer Viper ultimate with the extra Phi M for RGB mouse and absolutely love it I am constantly in between audio to right now I'm really liking the wireless Anheuser GSP 370 I also stopped gaming on my personal threat Ripper system and instead been using this insanely compact and powerful hoarser I 165 that has the same hardware as my Intel workstation which is just insane but the one piece of the puzzle that actually hasn't changed in the past two months is the keyboard this is the Razer Huntsman TE I would say Razer gets major points here for actually listening and releasing a keyboard with all the features that people have been asking for and it's what price to you at the hundred twenty nine dollars compared to offerings from Logitech and steel series the Huntsman Te actually has an upper hand and I've actually been using it for two months and we intentionally want to postpone our review videos so that I'm not using it for a week and giving you my impressions on the build quality and all the feature set but instead deliver a more longer-term piece that allows me to see if anything has gone wrong with this keyboard in the meantime this should be fun let's begin after this want to step up your air flow game look no further than the master fan SF 120 M from coolermaster featuring a damping frame designed to ensure stability a connected fan blade design for optimal cooling performance and an anti vibration motor that ensures better acoustics it's very simple to install and it comes with three fan speed controls check it out down below alright so let's go over the basics first I am quite surprised not to find any snakes only the Razer text above the arrow keys the frame itself is surprisingly light it's mainly plastic with a thin metal plate below the key caps which are floating style and the first thing that I appreciate here is the standard bottom row with emic stems on the switches for easy key cap swapping and customization something Logitech refused to do on their latest Logitech G Pro X keyboard we have a Type C connection with a braided long cable only on the left side again awesome for custom type C cables and in the bottom the dual height adjustment is always nice but the keyboard with these extensions is not as stable especially on a mousepad surface the key caps are double shot PBT and that coming from Razer surprises everyone they are slightly more grainy and matte texture compared to what ducky offers but really solid key caps overall there are a bit lighter in color than the frame so they're more dark gray than black and these are so much better than what Logitech and still Sears offer at the same price so non-glossy fingers even after months of usage plus no more gamer II font it's a slightly bolder and larger font versus the huntsmen elite it's clean it's easy to read except the font size for the top-right Keys is just too large and looks kind of awkward spending the entire key cap however there are many keys with uneven lighting caused by these black injection in the bottom and it's honestly not a deal-breaker as brightness is quite strong vibrancy and color is beautiful and while the secondary characters on the F keys are not illuminated they pop just fine in white now what we have under the hood are Razer's new linear red optical switches they are incredibly light at 40 grams operating at 1 millimeter so super fast with total travel distance of three point five millimeters so their light super fast and smooth there is no metal on metal contact to register the keystrokes since their optical so the entire movement up and down is clean effortless loud when you bottom out and is rated at a hundred million keystrokes now each switch comes with its own stabilizer and this means presses it off angle result in smooth motion no sticky keys here so the execution is perfect but these sound characteristics are a bit more clunky especially when you bottom out and that plastic touches and that metal sounding just kind of reverberates through the entire frame it's not that Pleasant if you love speed switches this thing is absolutely no brainer the actuation point is high and the switch is very light it's one of the reasons why I've been using the keyboard for so long just to try to get used to the feel while in game and for text for example the weight of my fingers would press into the key without my attention either activating shift spacebar or pressing a and this doesn't happen with my MX browns from ducky secondly typing airs in the first two weeks were annoyingly common I had to develop new finger memory for more precise keystrokes during text input and fast - now I'm perfectly comfortable with the weight and the speed of the switches this is my gaming keyboard of choice for csgo and anything casual I'm really fast at typing with a huntsman but I do prefer my MX browns on the ducky for anything text related because the switches are heavier and the quieter too and now the thing you've all been waiting for what issues have I discovered in the past two months so nothing major but basic things like dust pick up on the sides of the key caps is a minor thing because they're so textured my Alt key is starting to wear out at the front edge and no one in this household likes the sound of this keyboard including myself and at least four times that I can remember I have accidentally activated the sticky shift key by pressing it five times and that has resulted in multiple frustrations not realizing what was happening in game where I'm walking without pressing shift or doing something really strange at 4:00 sharp the actuation happens so fast and the recent point is exactly at the same time so you can you can be pressing it as fast as you can and just be mindful that the switch is very fast and requires a bit of readjustment in terms of finger memory and also realizing that the weight of your hand will press on those keys and lastly the synapse software is optional because of guest node in which you can macro every single key change up the lighting save the profiles to the keyboard and then migrate to computers without synapse installed and what I'm hoping this keyboard would do is send a shock wave to other brands because of just how well this keyboard has been received not only by gamers but by the entire keyboard community as a whole it's a strong recommendation from me if you want fast and light switches and if you don't mind the sound alright that's all for me make sure to check out this other relevant content over here subscribe for more I'll talk to you in this video",

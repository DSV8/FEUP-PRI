    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine. And today we're unboxing a new accessory for my iPhone 14. This could also be accessory for any smartphone, but since I did just get the iPhone 14 I'm going to celebrate good times by opening up the brand new DJI Osmo Mobile 6. Now with the new iPhone 14, it has this built-in action mode, which is already super stable. So they basically are like, \"Hey, you're not gonna need a gimbal.\" But with that action mode, there is a slight crop. So with this, you will be able to shoot in 4k, and yes, you will have a gimbal, but I love the DJI Osmo models because they're always so light. I always love using the DJI Osmo as an accessory to my iPhone mostly because it does have a lot of these really great shots that you can set up without needing another person. Like I could basically film everything myself. There's gesture control, there's tracking, and I'm so excited to open this up and test it out. (plastic crinkling) So you've got three-axis stabilization, we've got a quick launch, portable and foldable, active track 5.0, built-in extension rod, and there's some easy tutorials and one-tap editing. I love the DJI software because they always have really great AI editing and they've got a lot of these little quick tutorials that will give you some shots that you can set up to automatically make you a small little video edited to perfection. Oh, got a little pull-tab now. That's nice. I was ready to get my knife out. Whoop. And here it is. (device beeps) Oh! The quick launch! I like that. So when you unfold it it automatically starts up and is ready to go. Although, I wasn't ready yet so I'm just gonna turn it off for a second. Here's our phone mount. Nice, nice. Love to see it. And it also comes with a tripod. This is such a key for people who are doing a lot of solo shooting, solo travel, because you can set up all kinds of really cool shots that otherwise would be almost impossible to do with just a tripod. Oh, a little carrying pouch. Nice. A USB-C cable for charging. I'm gonna put everything in my little bag just to see how it fits. Oh, my goodness. I can fit everything in there. I guess it was planned that way. So this has a three-axis stabilization, active track 5.0, quick launch, shot guides, gimbal mode switch. It's portable, foldable with a built-in extension rod and a side wheel for focus and zoom. So this has an extendable rod to give you a little more I guess, length when you're shooting. So I've been doing a lot of Apple Watch reviews and I've been filming some of them by myself on the trail. So this would be really great to kind of get those little feet shots from like over here, running, trying to get my feet running. And then a little wider angle out here. Maybe a little side shot over here. I'm just picturing it now, but yeah, this is cool. This is also nice if you attach this to the tripod so you can have a nice, decent size tripod just like that, all built-in. And this is the magnetic- Oop! That was fast. Little phone clamp. And I like this because a lot of times when you have your gimbal and stuff on here you sometimes want to remove your phone, and then you just go like that. It must know that I'm ready to record some TikToks. So the app is downloaded. I do have to update the firmware but it's giving me a little tutorial of how everything works. So it's showing you how to record a video by pressing the record button. (phone chimes) Great. Recording has started. To stop recording press the stop recording button. Ooh, active track to track a subject. There we go. Excellent. I've learned how to track a subject. There you are. You're moving. You're moving and grooving. Press switch button three times to switch to photo mode. Ooh! Took a photo. Took a photo. Well done. You have taken a photo. Wow, we're so skilled. This is great. We're still tracking. One tap turns us back there. Two taps, portrait landscape switch. Here's ours. Oh my God, the zoom wheel is so cool. Look at this. Wow! Here's manual focus mode. Check that out! Manual focus. Okay, this is cool. This is freaking cool. (upbeat music) Automatically launches up. Pop on our phone and we are good to go. Like, that's so fast. I think the quick launch might be one of my favorite new features. The first thing that I wanna do is do the tracking, because obviously if I'm out shooting by myself and I wanna have some movement in my shots, doing the tracking is key. We're now on the front-facing camera. Active track is already on. Okay, I'm going to trace myself. That's my face. We're tracking. Let's hit record. (upbeat music) Like we could do a totally cool music video like this. Self-shot. DJI Osmo Mobile 6 in the house. Now, of course, I'm a huge TikTok fan. I love shooting vertical content. So let's just flip this to a little vertical action. I'm going to trace myself, got that face in there, and we're gonna shoot this in vertical. Oh, I'm going to use this so much for TikToks. Like you don't even know. You don't even know. I haven't done a cartwheel in so long I think I literally pulled every single muscle and ligament in my body. I see stars. Oh God, I'm dizzy. Now that I got the first one outta the way. Oh, the talent is a plenty. So for gesture control you either do a peace sign or a palm. Use simple gestures as shown to take photos and video. I like that. Okay. It says \"stay within two meters of your phone.\" Let's try a gesture control. Peace. (phone beeps) There it goes. 3, 2, 1. It's recording. (phone beeps) Yeah, palm to stop. (Justine applauds) If anybody knew what kind of magic was happening over here you would be lining up to see this. So I'm gonna test out how steady this is. So we're gonna do a little running around here. Here I go. Look at me running. Oh, it's so steady. It's so stable. It's so steady. Watch this. (upbeat music) (Justine gasps) Here we go. This is so stable. Okay, I'm gonna get myself, I'm gonna track my face, see how that goes when I run. Now it's definitely keeping me in frame and I'm still running. Oh, that's great. This is great. Now this is a shot that I've been wanting to get for some of my Apple Watch review videos. I wanna get this running shot. Now with the new zoom, I'm gonna do the ultra-wide, zoomed ultra-wide, and then I'm gonna hit record. We're recording. Here we go. (upbeat music) Okay. Let me see what it looks like. Let me see. Let me see. Oh, my God, this is exactly the shots that I've been trying to get. Dude, I'm so hyped right now. There's another cool little mode. This is the spin shot. So basically what you're gonna do is you're gonna rotate the joystick a little and it's gonna give you this cool little spin shot. (upbeat music) Look at that. Whoo! All right. Now we're gonna test out the story mode. So basically you can choose from a bunch of these different little stories. I'm gonna choose Modern City. So when we start this, we've got all of these options and it shows you how many seconds and what to shoot. So we're gonna follow the directions and get ourselves a little AI story and see what it looks like. (hype music) So I'm watching this story we just made right now, and it reminds me of like a 2018, I don't know, maybe like 2002, I'm not sure what date, but like an MTV music video intro to like, what is it, TRL or something. Like that's what this reminds me of. But it's cool because we literally did nothing. Like we shot those shots and then it automatically made it into a little movie for us. That's pretty cool. So now we're gonna shoot a clone me pano, so I can kind of see where I'm at. Okay, let's hit that. Okay, I gotta get in the shot. I think this is too low. Just a thought. Why are you making me go so low? So here's my pano clone me. I've been cloned three times. I wonder if they're available for hire. So this cool app called \"LightCut\" which will directly connect with your DJI Osmo and I love that this has this one-tap edit. So basically you can choose your files and it'll automatically edit some content for you together. And we can go into here, into the Inspire Cam. This is so fun. This will give you a lot of inspiration on things to shoot. So if you are going for a walk, you can click the Take a Walk. So it has all of these templates and you basically just follow the storyboard and it'll automatically create you a vlog. Feel like this is really great for beginners, people who have maybe never made a video or a vlog before. It kind of shows you how to make a story out of seemingly just a simple thing like going for a walk. So this is telling me to shoot a tree. Guess what? We've got a tree. I'm gonna hit record. And I'm basically just following what they did and kind of putting my own little spin on it. So you start a new project this gives you the ability to add in some shots that you've already filmed. So when you select those, you can go in, select some of your content already and it will edit something together for you and you won't have to do much of anything really. So that's another fun app and a different way that you can start using the DJI Osmo Mobile 6. If you guys wanna get more information about the DJI Osmo Mobile 6, I'll put a link in the description. I really think this is great for mobile vloggers, for people who may not have someone to help them shoot. The tracking, the gesture control, you're able to basically have a full camera studio right here inside of this gimbal. One of my favorite features on this though is the Zoom, like to be able to zoom in and out so quickly is honestly a game changer. Like, yeah, you could do that on the touch screen but if I was filming my feet I wouldn't be able to zoom in and out that way. I actually wouldn't even be able to get that shot because my arm would be, I'd be running like this. Not ideal. I also like that the zoom wheel also doubles as focus control so you'll be able to get some more precise shots if you do want to be able to go into manual control for the focus. So all in all, I'm pretty impressed with it. I had a lot of fun checking this out. And again, link the description. If you guys haven't already, please subscribe. Hit the bell to be notified when I post new videos. And check out some more of my videos here on the end screen. (upbeat music) Do you think those guys need this? Do you think they want it? Do you think they wanna try it out? Hey boys, check it out. Check it out now.",

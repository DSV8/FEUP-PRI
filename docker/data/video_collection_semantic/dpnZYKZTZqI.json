    "transcript": "considering YouTube's recent and highly controversial ban on live streaming underground baby battles early Express versus Best Buy pre-built may be a good replacement gladiatorial event especially for those of you that are too cowardly for the live event did I adequately explain what this video is about I'm not sure but whatever let's get into it today Roundup is sponsored by some be quiet RGB action every gamer has drool oh that doesn't look nearly as much like drools I was expecting um moving on every gamer has drooled over be quiet's RGB fans the light wings but now they're available in Pure White so like white Wings if you will oh even the Hub is white now so if you're in the market for some super high quality RGB fan action for be quiet check out the light wings now in white using the link in the video description [Music] thank you the first gladiatorial event for today's video is price I tried to get the final price that's including tax and shipping as close as possible for the AliExpress system I paid a total of a thousand and eighty Canadian whereas with the Best Buy system I paid a total of a thousand one hundred and fifty Canadian now interestingly uh because it's the final price the AliExpress system actually has quite a disadvantage here because it had to be shipped from China whereas the Best Buy system I just had to go wait in a store for a bit to pick it up which means that the base price of the AliExpress system is quite a bit lower at 830 Canadian rachmi as opposed to 999 Canadian rahmi on sale so this is technically the more expensive system I I guess depending on your outlook on life so one point to the AliExpress system battle number two is packaging now unfortunately for the AliExpress system its lack of Fox tape man effort is definitely gonna cost it some points here but with that let's have a look at what the Best Buy system has to offer [Music] the Best Buy system is a republic of Gamers PC a performance sub brand that's more dilute than BMW's M division at this point and as many of you probably know Aces is kind of in the dog box at the moment so hopefully the motherboard in this PC doesn't overvolt the CPU till it explodes fingers crossed now in terms of appearance who cares quite frankly it's a box that protective material inside is what's more important to me although asus's disturbing lack of hexagons does show how out of touch they are with modern gaming Trends a sentence that I can't believe I just said oh it is instantly crystal clear that the Acer system wins hands down in terms of protective packaging you can see we've got lots more of this soft foam having said that the AliExpress system did also use a similar quality of foam it was just a lot less of it in the box and the AliExpress system also doesn't have one of these nice mesh bags covering it one point for the Best Buy system in terms of accessories we get a SATA and power cable although I will be giving Aces a point here because they actually gave us the correct plug although I will be giving AliExpress a point for their quick start guide which doesn't look like a document explaining proper auditing procedure foreign oh yeah that's the undercarriage of a real beast of the system look at that which brings us to battle number four I think undercarriage Impressions and here the ollie Express system wins hands down despite having a bit of a skew foot it looks like the undercarriage of a gaming system and not the kind of PC a librarian has to kick to get started every morning one and a half points for the AliExpress system oh it's one of these I've had a look at one of them before and I I wasn't a fan I'd say side by side shockingly the Asus system manages to have a more restrictive looking front than the only express PC which have these intake slats on the side whereas the Acer system just has pretend ventilation although it does have this perforation on the side panel which combined with the single tiny exhaust fan means that we are going to get some air moving through here hopefully and unfortunately with the Acer system we do lose out on the RGB peen in terms of front i o there is a lot more going on on the AliExpress system I mean the Acer system doesn't even have a dedicated RGB button which funnily enough doesn't actually do anything but I'd say that if anything the extra USB 3 port on the top of the Acer system is a bit more useful in terms of booty both the systems offer essentially identical connectivity so there's no way to differentiate them on that although appearance Wise It's a little less clear-cut draw I guess the next category is extremely important power button quality I feel like the Best Buy power button is the clear winner 10 points skewing the points massively in favor of the Best Buy system but don't worry it's not going to be in the lead for very long but with that let's open up the Best Buy system to see what it's packing under the hood [Music] now I know what you're thinking but it's not quite as bad as it looks we get 16 gigs of ram in dual Channel just like the AliExpress system it seems like the oems are starting to learn which is good the 16 gig 3200 megahertz kit we get in the Best Buy system somehow seems even more Kirkland brand than the one we get in the AliExpress system the cooler and the motherboard may look like they were dug out of a parts bin for office PCS which quite frankly could be said for the whole PC but there isn't a bunch of proprietary crap in here so it's actually an upgradable system which is very good although the AliExpress system does look a lot less like an office PC that just fell into some cheap faster but what about the specs now aside from one pretty big difference between these two systems which we'll get to in a second I think their CPUs are relatively comparable they have a similar memory configuration and the same amount of nvme storage however in terms of graphics cards the Best Buy system gets mildly curb stopped it has a GTX 1660 TI in it compared to the RTX 2060 super in the AliExpress system so the benchmarks should be pretty interesting oh on that note let's check out the power supply in the Acer system [Music] I'd say rear cable management is maybe a smidge better on the Best Buy system but it's because they have no fans in the case that they need the cable manage but it feels a bit weird to give the AliExpress system points for Molex fans [Music] the next fisticuffs is down to power supply and this is a big one now on the surface it seems like they have very similar units in them this is also a 500 watt 80 plus bronze rated power supply but it's by chicone which is a reputable manufacturer whereas the one in the AliExpress system makes my Spidey sensors tingle with the specs out the waypoints have appropriately been assigned but before we look at the performance difference between these two systems the next category separates the chlamydia from the syphilis oh no the Best Buy system has a Windows install on it that makes you log into your Microsoft account that right there is at least worth minus 100 points and after happily linking my Microsoft account to the PC things only got worse for the Best Buy system oh another devastating blow to the Best Buy system which has McAfee pre-installed on it and as the channel rule states that's worth minus 300 points a rule is a rule my hands are tied hopefully it can redeem itself in terms of out of the box Ram speeds you were so close you're so almost there unfortunately both of the systems fail there is the ram clocked to the correct speed out of the box test although the Acer system fails it a little bit less round nine was a bit of a humiliation for Best Buy but maybe it'll make up for it in the gaming performance oh wait oh that is fascinating we are actually getting better GTA 5 driveway performance with the much less impressively GPU endowed Asus system because the CPU is a better match the slower GPU and the Best Buy systems just actually doing stuff in GTA 5. let's see if this carries over to Battlefield 5. now on First Impressions it seems to also be the case with Battlefield V but when it comes to the standardized benchmarks the AliExpress system does crawl ahead a little bit which is good considering the graphics card difference but clearly the 11400f is just built different in terms of temperatures and noise the Best Buy system is not only running a bit hotter than the AliExpress system was it's also a decent bit noisier now it could be that you can hear the noise more clearly because of the ventilation on the side panel as opposed to the solid tempered glass either way the system is quite obnoxious on the desk next to you anyway the next thing I want to do is set the asus's ram to its rated speed to see if we can get an even bigger boost in gaming performance before we check out some newer games a few moments later wait where where the ram options am I missing something what this kind of thing [Music] blows my mind when a motherboard manufacturer makes a pre-build that has a useless bios how does how does that make any sense to anybody we just have to live with it now I don't know that's another minus like 500 points the Best Buy system is quickly running out of tests to redeem itself on the totally not sarcastic David point scale but we've got a couple more benchmarks left with newer games the AliExpress system tightens its grip around the neck of the Best Buy system especially when it comes to cyberpunk but in The Last of Us the 1660 TI also really struggles to keep up and feels thick and heavy to play Resident Evil 4 is a similar story but the Best Buy system manages to deliver a very playable gaming experience at 1080p here so in all said and done which of the two systems would I buy well I wouldn't buy the best buy one because I feel like if I have access to a Best Buy I have better options than a crappy Asus pre-build with three generational Hardware in it and those better options are likely not in the Best Buy whereas with the AliExpress system it kind of depends on where you live I think there are regions in the world where there is a reasonable argument for buying this system but actually come to think of it it's not the scalpocalypse anymore so you probably should build your own system now which means neither of them win very good um until the next video bye-bye [Music]",

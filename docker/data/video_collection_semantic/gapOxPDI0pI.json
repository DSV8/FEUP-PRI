    "transcript": "- Yeah, I appreciate you hopping on the call with me, I had actually been following the story, I think for a couple of months now. What we're go do is set you guys up one, with a new computer, a new printer. - Oh my God, are you serious? - But on top of that, we've kind of come together to get $10,000 for you. So this is Ricardo Aguirre. He's a small business owner who was not only impacted financially because of the pandemic, but unfortunately it hit his health and his family as well. Himself, his wife, both kids, his parents, who are currently still battling the virus, all contracted it, and outside of his immediate family, he has now lost total of six relatives due to the virus. So huge thanks to HP for sponsoring this project and honestly making all of this possible. They asked if I wanted to showcase their Neverstop Laser tank printer, and I figured since it was geared towards small businesses, I asked if we can do that and help one out at the same time? They said, yes, and here we are. So real quickly covering what a Neverstop printer is and why you potentially want one as a small business owner. If you're looking for a model laser, AKA black and white printer, this is it. In a nutshell, it is a cartridge free laser tank solution that allows you to print thousands of pages, literally right out of the box. What I mean by that is you're getting up to 5,000 pages of preloaded toner included. It's kind of like that piece of tech you get home only to realize you still need to buy batteries or in this case toner, but with this, you don't. Once you get through those 5,000 pages though, it's less than $20 for a toner reload kit. And when you stack that against other in-class laser toner cartridges, which costs upwards of 40 to $60, you are saving a ton of cash. So the end result is you're getting the lowest cost per page that you print, it's actually less than a penny per page. And really it ends up being a great business investment, which is why it made perfect sense for Ricardo. Now alongside that new printer, I wanted to hook him up with some cool accessories that HP sent out. I'll drop a link to those down below. But more importantly, a new computer. I think the 27 inch HP pavilion all in one pairs perfectly. It looks great, it sounds great, it packs a really small compact footprint and packs some pretty impressive hardware for the money. It packs an eight core Intel i7 chip, 12 gigs of Ram, a builtin SSD, which is always nice. There's tons of ports, including HTMI in which you don't really see too often. So with that, you can connect another computer or even a console. The speakers, which are by Bang and Olsen, sound really good to the point where you don't need to buy external ones. And because of that, the less things you need to buy externally means less cables, less clutter for a super clean setup. So like I said, I've been following this story for a couple months and wanted to help out any way I could. I then reached out to Ricardo and asked if he'd be willing to talk about his story. So he had no idea the surprise was coming. - [Ricardo] Okay, I'm ready bud, whenever you are. - Cool, I guess first we'll get into what you do as far as your business and everything. - [Ricardo] I'ma take off the mask. - Cool. - So my name is Ricardo Aguirre. I'm the chef owner of Tamales Tacos Parlor. Tamales Tacos Parlor was founded by my wife and I. In 2012 we went ahead and starting this business out of necessity. I became unemployed. Used to work for Firestone and they laid us off and it all started, like I said, out of necessity and kind of like a dare. My wife's friends dare her to make some good Tamales, and she asked me to go ahead and help her out, which we did. And eventually, 10 dozen turned into 20 and so on and so on. And we were pretty busy. We started doing this full time. But when March came in 2020, everything changed for us. And by Tuesday, March 17th, we went ahead and ceased operation. We stopped doing everything. And literally that same day customers started calling us, requesting a refund, canceling all of their events. So next thing you know is we're negative on our chicken account. But during that whole week, we started having body aches, the shortness of breath. I had fever, vomiting. We couldn't breathe. My temperature reached 105.9. My wife's was 103.6. My parents were also 103, 106. And then by Saturday, the ninth, when we returned home, both my parents were very ill. They were literally not able to breath at all whatsoever. So I took both my parents and myself to the ER. When we arrived there they immediately took my dad into the back because he was the one that was having the worst symptoms, while my mom and myself, we were in the triage for 24 hours because they didn't have any hospital beds available. An hour later, my wife arrived to the hospital, also checked herself in and she was also diagnosed with the COVID-19. My dad was intubated on May 13th. He was on the ventilator for 28 days. They had to do a tracheotomy, dialysis, he's had first stroke. While this is happening my mom was also on the hospital, she was on the ventilator. They put her on a ventilator on May, 22nd. And then finally she was excavated around June second, if I'm not mistaken, June second. Somewhere around there, I can't remember the day exactly. By then I had to go to the hospital and get trained on how to take care of her at home. I had to learn how to do dressing for the pressure ulcer. She was very weak and to feed her bathe her, do everything for her. She literally, she can't do anything anymore. She was very active. She had a full time employment. Now that's gone. Then on top of that, we had five family members that passed away. The first one was on May 13th, while we were in the hospital. Then my uncle on May 25th. His son-in-law on May 27th. My uncle's mother-in-law on June second. And then I had an aunt that passed away on June first in Mexico city. My mom every day, she's crying. She's like, \"Why can't I sit up by myself? \"Why can't I do this by myself?\" So right now I came out to Walmart to get her meds and my brother stayed with her. So she needs 24 hour assistance from any one of us. And that's tough because I wanna get back to work, but I can't, I gotta take care of her. The only thing I can say is that most people don't think it's real or they pay mind to it until it happens to either one of their family members or to them. The only thing I can say is just wear a mask, do your part. Don't do it for you, do it for others. There's some people out there that their immune system is compromised, they don't have maybe the luxury of having a strong immune system like some of us. - So really after a couple minutes of talking with him, you could see what kind of person he was, what he'd been through. So I was super happy to get to surprise him, not only with the printer, the computer, but with the $10,000 as well. There's no stipulation. It's not like, don't worry about for the business. If it's bills, like whatever it is, it's just gonna be $10,000 for you to help you out. - Thank you. I appreciate it, man. I really do. It's been hard, it's been really hard. I asked everyday, I do my daily prayers, I literally was crunching my fingers this morning because I didn't know how I was gonna pay for my rent. And I literally have $47 left in my account and I didn't know what to do. I was just hoping something would happen. My dad always taught me that, you do good deeds, good deeds will come to you. Our company always focusing on helping other families. When hurricane Maria hit in 2017, over in Puerto Rico, we were able to gather a truck, a 50 foot truck full of stuff, and we send it over there to Puerto Rico. The same thing happened to Mexico city, when the Mexico city earthquake came, we sent an airplane full of a cargo and you can see the stories, because they did a story on us at the Arizona Republic where we send all that help to Mexico city and throughout the years, every 12th of December, which is (speaks in foreign language) Virgin Mary, we go out to the homeless shelters and we feed the homeless and we give food away. Just a way of us saying, thank you for the blessings that we received. And now I'm receiving that in return, and that's what keeps me going. That's the message that I wanna get to people. If you do good, good things will come to you. Right now my parents they're still sick, but they're still here. There's still hope My wife is pregnant with a seven month old, girl, our first girl in the family. And that also helps us in all that, thinking, we have something to look forward to. It's hard as hell, but not impossible to get back to how we were maybe. I'm sorry if I'm crying, it's just, I'm very emotional right now. - Nah, it's all good man, you got me, I'm tearing up over here, don't even sweat that. - Thank you so much. Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart. I'm very touched. Thank you to HP for the generosity that they're also showing and, you guys will be in my prayers every single day from now on until the rest of my life. I'm very grateful for this, thank you so much. - [Host] So I have a link to his GoFundMe down below, and if you can support in any way, whether it's sharing or donated it's much appreciated. Thank you guys so much for watching and I'll catch you guys later.",

    "transcript": "I completely shut off my heat when it was -11 degrees Fahrenheit outside for an entire 24hours to prove a point: my homes heating systemis wildly oversized and replacing that equipment with more modern technology will be much lessinvolved than Local HVAC Company X probably thinks. One day in the not-too-distant future, I will undoubtedly be replacing my gas-fired forced-air furnace with an electric heat pump. Heat pumps, despite what your Uncle on Facebook might be yelling at you, are much better forthe planet, and eventually (if not right now but due to variations in local energy supply costs I cannot give a blanket statement yet) they'll be better for your wallet, too. But ifsomeone were to look at my current heating system, and that someone assumes my current heatingsystem is actually appropriate for my home, which they very well might assume because it was specced and installed by industry professionals, they might conclude that I will need a very large heat pump capable of matching my current systems heat output. Heres the thing, though - I dont. Not by a longshot! My current heating system is between three and four times larger than itactually needs to be. And now I have solid proof to back it up. Which I will be showingyou. That is indeed the point of this video. Before we continue, though, with this video, I want to try something different. The video youre currently watching wont be that different: itll still be a wild ride where I explain way too much in my typically cantankerous fashion. But you may have noticed the runtime. Yeah, were covering a lot - also, Ill apologizeup-front, the teaser about shutting off my heat? Itll be a little bit before we get there. Buttruthfully, the conclusions here are important and I want this to spread beyond my normal audience. So I will be releasing a condensed version tailored to a more general audience alongsidethis one on the second channel. If there are people in your life you wish to share this with, or youre just short on time, that might be a better fit. Theres a link in the description and rightthere. But for the rest of ya, well here we go. In the intro, I used the word \"oversized.\" Thatsreally what this video is about: determining the correct HVAC system sizing. By size, Imean the systems total heating and cooling capacity. Systems come in different sizesbecause every home is different and how much heating and cooling that home needs dependson many factors. How big is it? How tall are the ceilings? How many floors? Where is it? Whats the local climate? Which direction are the windows facing? How many are there? How big are they? Whats their R-value? Are they low-E windows? Is there shading from treesor other structures? What building materials is the home made from? How old is it? How muchinsulation does it have and where? What kind of home is it? Single-family? Multi-family? Isthere a basement? Crawlspace? Slab? Attic? And on and on and on. All of that actually matterswhen determining the heating and cooling demand a home will need, and that demand shoulddictate the equipment that gets installed. But thats a lot of variables to juggle, andif theres one thing I know about humans, its that wed rather things be easy thancorrect. So way more often than not (at least in literally all of my experience thus far) the main and quite possibly only variable that is considered is the homes total floor area andHVAC system capacities get chosen using simple rules of thumb based on the geographic area yourein, possibly tweaked by a sales reps observations if you're lucky. And that simply isnt goodenough any longer for many, many reasons. Which brings me to me! A while ago I movedinto a fairly new townhome. That term is kind of regional so in case youre not familiar or itmeans something else where you live, its a kind of multi-family housing where one large structure is subdivided into multiple housing units which share one or more walls, but each housing unit has its ownprivate exterior entrances. You might call it a rowhouse or something like that but they can be inmany different styles. Since my home is fairly new and Im sharing walls with neighbors, its prettyenergy-efficient! My average gas bill in the winter is about $70 and my average electric billin the summer (which includes driving by the way since I have an electric car) is about actuallythats just about $70, too. Wild what denser housing options and efficient construction methods cando for our resource needs and thus wallets, eh? Before this turns into anurban planning video, though, my homes current heatingand cooling system is the very-typical-for-much-of-the-US-but-especially-here-in-the-Midwest centrally-ducted natural gas-fired forced-air furnace with central air conditioning. The furnace is rated for 60,000 BTU/hr, and the air conditioner is a two-ton unit (which justmeans it can produce 24,000 BTU/hr of cooling). Now, the air conditioner was actually sizedappropriately. Based on how last summer went, 2 tons of cooling is just about right for myhome. But the furnace? Its way too big! The heat barely ever needs to run even in very coldweather. Its almost comical how little my furnace runs. Lest you think Im just being hyperbolicor perhaps unobservant, I have a smart thermostat which allows me to look at exactly how long ithas commanded the heating and cooling system to run over a day. And I know for a fact that inthe winter the heat is barely ever running. Heres what a typical winter day looks like with my current heating system: January 5th was a cloudy day with the temperature hoveringright around freezing point. With essentially no help from the sun, my furnace was providing theonly heat to keep me warm and it needed to run for 3 hours and 10 minutes total. Thats all. We see this large spike in the morning when my program raises the set point to 69, but otherwisethe furnace ru- sorry, *nice* - but otherwise the furnace runs for about 10 minutes per hour. At 10:00 at night my set point drops to 65, and then it didnt run again until the nextmorning. With 24 hours in a day, and the heat only running for 3.16 of them, then the furnace onlyneeded to produce about 13% of its total capacity. If you know a thing or two about HVAC systemdesign, then you should know that this is ridiculous. The heating system is oversizedto an absurd degree if its performing like that when temps are around freezing. But... this is Chicago. It gets a lot colder than that. How about we look at that cold snap wehad two Christmases ago? December 23rd, 2022 started out at a balmy -8 degrees (which is-22 for those who speak Metric). Despite it being that frigid, the furnace ran for 6hours total. 6 hours of 24 is a nice 25%, so even in that weather thefurnace is barely taxed at all. Keen-eyed viewers may notice we dont see thatmorning spike in this data - I was actually away from home during this period, so the thermostat was only maintaining 62 degrees (or not-quite 17 celsius) inside. That does mean that ifit were maintaining my normal set point it would need to run a bit more, but not much - maintaining 62 in this weather is still fighting a 70 degree differential, so this is roughlyequivalent to if I were home and the outside temp was 0 Fahrenheit, -18 Celsius. Also important, since nobody was home, there werent any other heating sources in action like cooking appliances or human bodies to skew this data. Zooming out to look at more days, wellit turns out that six hours is the most my furnace has ever run in a 24 hour period. Since its onlyspending at most of the time in a day heating, even in extreme cold, that suggests the furnaceis oversized by a factor of four. Its four times larger than it needs to be. But, to account forthe lower set-point and the fact that it was only -8 out there, Ill fudge that and say thatthe furnace is oversized by a factor of three. Now, I wish I could tell you that my home is somekind of fluke. But truthfully, I cant - I have run across oversized heating equipment in prettymuch every home I have ever been in around here. A friend of mine has a furnace which is soridiculously oversized for their ductwork that they cant even partially close any registers at all to help balance heat output between rooms without the thing tripping out on the high limitsafety switch. Im pretty sure that install was a hack job, so I dont want to put too much weighton it, but even respectable, well-known installers in my area are routinely putting way more heatingcapacity into homes than those homes actually need. You might ask, is that really a problem, though? So what if you have more heat than you need? Well, strictly speaking, its usually not a functionalproblem. Oversizing cooling equipment can lead to nasty issues - just ask my other friend whohas a small two-bedroom slab-on-grade house built about 20 years ago and who just hada well-respected HVAC company conclude that three tons of cooling was appropriate for thatlittle house. You bet that sucker short-cycles and cant dehumidify worth a darn! Anyway, withheating equipment, having way more heat on-tap than is truly necessary doesnt typically matter, especially with gas-fired heating equipment where energy efficiency isnt impacted by cycle timesmuch if at all. When your heat source is gas, installers can get away with being quite sloppy. They just have to err on the side of too much heat. Nobodys gonna complain about having toomuch, and older homes which are poorly insulated will need more than newer homes, so leaningon the high side is generally the safe bet. But this habit needs to die. Were not gonnabe heating our homes with gas forever. Pick whatever reason youd like, there are plenty. Heat pumps are in the news so much these days because they allow us to capture ambientheat energy from outside, concentrate it, and move it inside. That process is soefficient that we can end up with 3 or sometimes even 4 times as much energy inside our homes than we spend to collect it. That is why they are such a big deal - its a way we can get more heat with less energy expenditure, and doing more with less is alwaysa good idea. For that reason alone, more and more people will be using heat pumps as their primary or possibly only source of heat. They just make way too much sense. And whenspeccing a heat pump system, actually installing the correct equipment with the correct capacityis very important! More than its ever been. Why? Well for the simplest of starts, youdont want to pay for more than you need. Larger equipment is more expensive, but not justto purchase it. Since heat pumps are electric sources of heating and cooling, larger systemsrequire more electrical capacity to run them, and that makes everything from installation to considerations of backup power needs harder tomanage! You really dont want to be installingsystems that are bigger than necessary but this old habit just keeps happening. Itjust happened last spring to my parents, a story Ill be telling later on in this video. Why does this keep happening? Well, ifyoull permit me this speculative indulgence, I believe that a big problem today isthe structure of many HVAC companies. Any moderately-sized residential HVAC business seems to have separated the role of sales from those of service and installation. This mightseem like a good thing - trained and licensed technicians only have so much time in a day, andtheir skills are too valuable to waste on free consultations. But I gotta tell ya, I think thisdivision of roles and focus on speed over accuracy is causing a lot of headaches for everyone. Perhaps separating your team into sellers, fixers, and installers is efficient on paper - andmaybe it is more profitable. But it also makes it difficult or impossible for anyone within thosecordoned-off roles to develop the big pictureperspectives necessary to correctly determine thebest course of action for any given situation. Another problem which is particularly rampant incold parts of the country like mine where heat pumps arent yet common is, well, dishonesty. See, heres a secret the industry doesnt want you to know: Despite the cliche, Im notreally joking. Those fancy heat pumps weve been talking about? Turns out, heat pumps ARE JUST AIR CONDITIONERS! Thats all they are! Theyre just air conditioners equipped withan extra valve so they can operate in reverse to produce heat! Shout it from the rooftops, put it on a T-shirt, annoy your friends, and spread the word. They are not magic technology or evennew technology! Theyre the same basic machines these companies have been installing for wellover half a century with a few extra parts and, these days, smarts. Everyone in the industryknows this, at least I sure hope they do, but salespeople wouldnt be good at their jobs if all they did was provide you with honest information. Price gouging on heat pump systems isabhorrent right now, and I have countless stories both personally and from conversations online of people getting $20,000 or even $30,000 quotes to install equipment which you can buy from online HVACwholesalers for about 4 grand shipped. And sure, theres installation costs - people need to getpaid, I know that. But theres some magic money math going on when a central heat pump system costs 3 or 4 times as much as a new furnace and AC replacement. Because the heat pump partIS THE SAME THING as an AC replacement. One of the reasons I suspect people aregetting such wildly expensive quotes to install heat pump equipment is that, dueto the whole separation of duties I just went over and the old habits which just refuse to die, the folks coming out to give consultations are simply looking at the equipment thats currently in the home and, so long as the homeowner doesnt voice complaints aboutits performance, speccing a heat pump system to match the current systems output. That isprecisely what happened to my friend with the 3-ton AC in the two-bedroom house. A 3-tonwas there before so just slap a new one in, right? Thatll do. This tactic makes sense on thesurface, but the problem is that seemingly nobody is doing a sanity check to determine whether ornot the current equipment is actually appropriate for that home. And in my case, nobodydid that when the home was built, either! Another thing I want to touch on is somethingthat I keep hearing online. Many people with centrally-ducted systems who want to get aheat pump have been told that their ducts are too small to have a heat pump. Im sure that this istrue in some cases, but if the person who told them that didnt check to see if their currentheating system is actually sized correctly, well then maybe those ducts are too small for the heat pump that person *thinks* they need but theyre fine for the heat pump that they *actually* need. Keep that in mind as we continue this discussion. So, then, the next question of course is how do youdetermine whats actually appropriate for any given home? Well, heres what's really frustrating - We have more and more tools to figure this out and it aint that hard. First, letsdiscuss the increasingly common piece of tech which got this ball rolling in thefirst place: a smart thermostat. Having one can be extremely valuable. Certainly Im notgoing to tell you to rush out and get one and, also, Im not particularly loyal to one system overanother. Trust me, I get plenty frustrated with some of the asinine things they do - askme about their ridiculous implementations of a hold function. If they even have one. And while we're at it, Google - heres a question for you: HOW ARE YOUR LOCATION SERVICES AND HOME/AWAY ASSIST FUNCTIONS **STILL** SO INCREDIBLY BAD If my Android phone - A Pixel! With your own dang SOC! On which I have given the Google Home app full, unrestricted location access with precise locationand WiFi scanning turned on happens to find itself on the same WiFi network as the Google Nest thermostat which is WIRED TO MY FURNACE and CAN'T MOVE oh, AND the phone can also can see all of those Chromecast-enabled devices on the same network, too, which you know belong to that home because the Home app is what manages all that crap, well then surely I must be home, right? I cant have moved a mile or two down the road - in my sleep - with all that stuffstill in-range of the phone, right? RIGHT [clears thoat] Despite their irritations, a smartthermostats ability to log and tell you what it did over a day throughout the year is tremendouslyuseful. That information alone, when combined with your heating system information, can get you extremely closeto the actual heating load of your home. All you need to do is find a day where it was extremelycold and look at how long it ran. With a simple, single-stage gas-fired centrally-ducted furnace, how long that furnace runs over a given period of time tells you how much heating itactually produced. Its that simple. But perhaps you noticed there were some qualifiersthere. Some fancy heating systems can actually run at two output levels, perhaps more. If youre in that boat, data from a thermostat isnt necessarily useless but its going to requiremore consideration than I can address. And certain kinds of heating systems wont necessarily give you such clean data at all, plus if you have zoned heating and individual room thermostats this all gets pretty complicated pretty quickly. But for many millions of you in North America, youhave the same four-wire thermostat system that Ido which only offers heating with fire, coolingwith AC, blowing with fan, or nothing with off. As weve already determined, apparently my heat will only ever run of the time at most in the coldest weather we ever get, which meansI only really need of my current heating system's capacity. Since currently I have 60,000 BTU/hrat my disposal, my actual heating load appears to be 20,000 BTU/hr at most. And since heat isheat, we can convert that to a continuous power output of 5.86 kW. If Ive done the mathright and reality is as it appears to be, thats the most heating power I should everneed to keep the house comfortably warm. Assuming that is correct, then to completely eliminate gas for heating I only need a 2-ton heat pump, which is perfect because thats what my air conditioner happens to be. This is why I said this is gonna be easier for me than Local HVAC company X probably thinks. I very much doubt many would believe that a home in Chicago would have the same cooling needs in summer as it does heating needs in the winter, but the data and mymath shows this to be true. But have I done my math right? Are my assumptions here correct? There are some reasons to be cautious. Firstly, while my furnace is rated for 60,000 BTU perhour, I dont have a way to confirm that its actually performing as-designed. Hopefullythe installers hooked up a manometer to it and adjusted the gas valve according to themanufacturers specifications but I dont know for a fact that that occurred. Even if it did,though, well there are still confounding factors to consider. For one, the 60,000 BTU ratingon my furnace is its input. With an annual fuel utilization efficiency of 92 percent, its only really outputting 55,200 BTU/hr when it runs. If anything that makes my math seemconservative, but its important to keep in mind. There are also two other minor sources ofdata fuzziness which reduce the accuracy of a data-logging thermostat. If youve evernoticed that your gas meter measures the gas flowing through it in a unit of volume but yourebilled for your gas consumption in units of energy, thats because natural gas is just some crapwe get out of the ground and its purity (and thus energy content) varies somewhat fromday to day which your gas utility corrects for when billing you. So even if I knew for afact that my furnace were working perfectly, its actual heat output wont be perfectlyconsistent. Also, the thermostat logs how long it calls for heat, but at every start-up, theres a delay while the furnace goes throughits ignition sequence so the thermostat isslightly overreporting total energy output. Now, to be clear, all these little sources oferror are unlikely to amount to much, and two of them work in my favor anyway. But it doesmean that my 20,000 BTU/hr conclusion probably isnt perfect. I still know my furnace is wildlyoversized no matter what, but for now, lets set the conclusions from the thermostat to the side. Thatll also make it fair for those of you without central heating or more elaborate setups. How elsecould you determine your actual heating needs? Why, with science! Its time I introduce you toa little thing called a block load calculation. Turns out, very few homes are builtwith exotic materials - and even then, with almost no exceptions we know the thermalproperties of the construction materials we use to build homes. Insulation has an R-valuewhich tells you its resistance to heat transfer. Windows have R-values, too - plus low-e coatings help reduce solar heating in the summer and reduce radiant losses in the winter. The materialson the exterior of the home have an influence, too - an influence which those science peoplehave quantified. And to tie this all together we have these tools called measuringtapes which let us gauge the size of walls and windows. If you actually takethe time to assess these variables, you can do a load calculation which willtell you how much heating (and cooling) your home actually needs depending onwhere you live and how it was built. For grins and giggles, I went and did one of thesefor my home! I used an online Manual-J calculator (manual-J is essentially the industry standard for how to do a block load calculation) and after inputting all my measurements, it told me thatId need 19,000 BTU/hr of heating with a design temperature of -15 and an indoor setpoint of70 degrees. Thats awful-darn close to what my thermostat just told me, innit? Now, you may notice Ihave not shown you the results of this calculation (or even the calculation itself). Thats because I dont really want to share too many details of my homesspecifications but also and equally importantly I closed out the tab and dont feel like doing itagain. Plus, the site I used was very clunky and homebrew, and to be honest Im kind of afraid ofunleashing all of you on it. It seemed fragile. Id love to point you all to a good resource but honestly the way the calculation is performed is pretty intimidating, especially if youhave the same visceral dread reaction that I do whenever I accidentally open Excel. A more easy-to-use and guided manual-J calculator would be a very welcome thing, literally any of you watching who might have those skills and be inclined to buildsuch a tool. I think, as the kids say, there should be an app for that. Id love to playwith it but more importantly, an easy-to-use tool for professionals in the field is very overdue. It has to be easy or it just wont happen. You may have noticed me use the term designtemperature just a bit ago. Heating a home (or any structure for that matter) is a never-endingbattle against heat loss. If its warmer inside than out, heat will seep out through walls andwindows. Entropys just annoying like that. And to maintain a consistently warmer temperatureinside than out, you have to match that heat loss with a source of replacement heat. Howquickly your home loses heat depends on all those factors I was talking about earlier, so onesize definitely does not fit all. If theres one thing to take away from this video, its that. But there is one factor that is universal: the greater the temperature difference between inside and outside, the faster heat will leave. Doesnt matter how big the home is or how well-insulatedit is, thats just physics doing physics things. Ultimately, that boils down to a simpletemperature differential. A given heating system in a given home can only possibly make the indoor temperature X degrees warmer than the outdoor temperature. The designtemperatures are simply a way to relate that theoretical limit to your local weatherconditions and a chosen indoor setpoint, so for instance around here, -15 Fahrenheitis about the coldest we ever experience, and if I want to be able to maintain a 70degree indoor temperature in those conditions, well those are my design temperatures. -15outdoors and 70 indoors. Really, though, that just means I want enough heat on-tap to keepthe home 85 degrees warmer inside than outside. And heres something I get the senserelatively few people know. When a heating system is properly sized to a givenhome and its chosen design temperatures, then when we hit those design temps outside, the heating system will need to run nonstop - and that is normal. It might sound weird.But think about it - the design temperatures are the absolute worst conditions aheating system should expect to fight, and they only show up once or twice a year -if that. There isnt actually a need to have any more heat capacity available than what thedesign temperatures dictate - especially when, even if the weather happens to dip belowthe design temp, a wide variety of simple supplemental heat sources, such as spaceheaters, is available for you to fill the gap. That means, though, that there is at least onetrue benefit to oversizing a heating system. If youre like me and like to turn the heat down atnight to sleep a little cooler, a properly-sized heating system will take ages to get back to your daytime setpoint when the weather hits its design conditions. Im of the mind that sincethis is a very uncommon circumstance over a year, thats not really a problem. But some folks wouldprobably be angry if they needed to whip out an extra heater in a cold snap to get the indoortemperature to rise quickly in the morning. This is undoubtedly another reason HVAC companies are prone to going overboard, and some manner of customer education is probably warranted here. The good news is that with heat pump systems, auxiliary back-up heating can be and often isinstalled and that can work alongside the heat pump to quickly raise the temperature whendesired, at least if configured properly. Anyway, we now have two sources of data that aretelling me the furnace is about triple oversized. Theres what my thermostat has said with allof the homes variables accounted for in-situ, and what the manual J calculation (whichaccounts for all those variables on paper) determined. The fact that they were within5% of each other is pretty impressive, but both are still not quite what Idcall perfect. To completely verify them, I wanted a way to be exact. No fudge factor,no guesswork, no weird variables - exact. And I knew just the trick! Through themagic of buying... [sigh] seven space heaters, I could design a test to find out exactlyhow much energy is needed to heat my home in the most extreme of weather. All Ineeded now was a bunch of kill-a-watts, digital thermostatic controls, andsome extreme weather. So I got some digital thermostatic controls, a bunch ofkill-a-watts, and eventually the ol Polar Vortex turned up in the forecast. On January14th we were in for quite the arctic blast. And I do mean quite the - low temperatures of -15were predicted (thats -26 for the French) and thats just about as cold as it ever gets here. SoI set to work. And now - here comes an important disclaimer. I will not show you exactly how Iset this test up. Ill explain the gist and go over the many considerations I had to make, but I tooka number of fairly big risks performing this test which could have ended up with frozen pipes or evena fire. I did everything I could to stay safe, and am happy to report that nothing happenedbut some good ol fashioned data gathering. But, do not try this yourself. It may not evenbe possible depending on your homes wiring. So why use space heaters? Well, electricresistive heat is as dumb as it gets. A watt is a watt is a watt, and with a watt-hourmeter I can quantify how much heat was actually produced by one of these things because the heater simply turns all of the electricity it consumes into heat. Space heaters here in the US are nearlyall capable of outputting 1,500 watts of heat. And since apparently I dont even need 6 kW ofheat output, four of them running continuously should be all that I need to heat my home even inthe worst weather we ever experience. But there are a few problems: first, I have more than fourlocations I need heat to come from. I have 10 heat registers around the home and they were all placedwhere they were for good reason, though a couple are technically redundant. Second, while spaceheaters are rated for 1,500W, that rating usually assumes a line voltage of 125V. I typicallyget a little less than 120V at my receptacles, and after the bit of voltage drop caused by theheater itself, in my home the actual output of a resistive space heater tends to be around 1300watts. So only having four might not be enough. But most importantly to setting up the test, a spaceheater maxes out the safe continuous load capacity of an ordinary 15A electrical circuit, and even20A circuits cannot run two space heaters at the same time without the breaker tripping. So beforeI could run this test, I would need to identify locations where I could actually plug all these spaceheaters in which were not sharing circuits. This was easy enough for me to figure out... after discovering that one of the outlets in the garage is on the same circuit as the bonusroom the hard way, and I eventually identified five places where I could get power from and notworry about tripping anything. But it still required the use of extension cords. DUN DUN DUNNNNNN Extension cords and space heaters Oh even worse! Remember how I bought seven spaceheaters? Thats more than five. And actually I already had two and was using nine during thetest! Which meant that splitters and power strips were involved, too! I wasnt kidding when I saidI took some big risks and said you shouldnt do this yourself. So let me just say that again - do not do this yourself! But what sort of space heaters did you use, I hear you asking? Well- the cheapest kind you can buy! And not just because Im a cheapskate, but because these areactually the best kind for simply heating a room for a test like this. The fan churns up the air to mix it around well and the resistive wire elements dont produce much radiant heat so you dont have to worry aboutweird hot spots or losses through a window. But even better, these cheap fellas are reallyuseful given the constraints I had to work with and helped reduce the risks of a fire from thoseextension cords. These basic fan-forced heaters usually contain two heating elements: a 600Welement and a 900W element. That allows them to offer a low, medium (labeled \"ECO\" in thiscase because space heater manufactsss nevermind) and high by using one, the other,or both elements together. Since the fan draws a measly 10 watts, that means you can safelyuse two of these on the same circuit assuming they are both on low or one is on low and theother is on medium. And since, in that case, the most one will draw is about 8 amps, using an extension cord isnt quite so scary. But actually I used two more space heaters! Ofa sort... Since I was shutting my heating system entirely off, there were two more things I hadto worry about: the pipes in the cabinet under the kitchen sink (which is on an outside wall andabove the unconditioned garage) and the insulated crawlspace where my water comes into the home. Normally those areas get a bit of heat from the ducts running near or through them, but theywouldnt during the test. So, I bought a couple of those little wireless weather stations andput their outdoor sensors in said crawlspace and under said sink so I could monitor them, and to provide those areas with a bit of heat, I threw in some incandescent Christmas lights. Who says you cant be risky and festive at the same time? Those lights provided about 100watts of heat in the crawlspace and 80-ish under the kitchen sink, and the weather stationthingies proved that was sufficient. Now, every single one of these heat-producingdevices eventually got plugged into one of five... these things: these digital temperature controllers allowed me to control the temperature digitally. They simply take readings from their remotesensing probes and control the electrical outlet on the front through a relay. You tell ita turn-on temperature and a turn-off temperature and boom! Youve got yourself a properthermostat which can ~supposedly~ handle 15A of load. But 16 in Europe! Yet only 10 inAustralia. But 13 in the UK! Are there any safety certifications on - thats not important, whats important is the house didnt burn down and these allowed me to control the spaceheaters... and Christmas lights with precision! For the test, to hopefully mimic the heatingcharacteristics of my central system, I put the actual space heaters near towhere the heat registers in my home are (which is along outside walls near windowsand doors as they should be. They got that part right!). Then I set the temperaturecontrollers up in the five locations I was powering everything from and positionedtheir sensing probes in central areas of each room away from the heaters. And,of course (and of utmost importance), each one of those was plugged into an energymonitor so I could see how much energy was used by each set of heaters. Total them all up over24 hours and I could get a near-perfect figure. In pursuit of that perfection, the nightbefore the test began, I observed the measured temperature of each controller bothwhen my furnace began heating and then stopped, then I programmed the controllers to keep therooms they were in within that same temperatureband. I did this to mimic the little room-to-roomvariations that naturally occur due to the system being centralized. And for good measure, Ihad some of my trusty data loggers set up to verify for you that the heaters were actuallydoing their job. Oh, I also put one outside to measure the outdoor air temperature for myself inaddition to pulling data from Weather Underground. With the final setup, I had somewhere inthe neighborhood of 6,500 watts of heatdistributed throughout my home. Based both onmy thermostat data and the manual J calculation, this should not only be enough to keepeverything warm, but the heaters shouldnt even need to run nonstop. All that was left now was to wake up the next day and start the test. At 8:00 AM,the observed temperature outside was -11, and after resetting all of the energy monitors, itwas time to switch on the heaters and switch off the furnace. Before long, the temperaturecontrollers had all started turning on their heaters (and Christmas lights) andnow, all that was left to do was watch. And, as expected, despite it being extremelyunpleasant outside (and pretty windy, too) the heaters were more than enough. Beforelong, the first temperature controller was satisfied and the heaters it controlled had shutoff. Then the next one. And then the next one. Of course, they kicked back on, too, but the fact that the heaters were sufficient to raise the indoor temperature - even when the outside temp was 80degrees colder than inside - was very good news. However, when I began this test, the sun wasup. The one consolation we typically get here when the arctic blasts rear their ugly heads isthat the sky tends to be cloudless, so it may be life-threateningly cold out there but hey! At least its a brightsunny day! This also meant Id be getting a bit of solar heating, though, and where exactly Idget it would vary throughout the day. This didnt matter for the data - I was taking measurements from each energy monitor every four hours, so I could remove the daytime period if desired. But itdid mean that I had to fiddle a lot with the setup - especially on the main floor which is mostly onebig room. Two thermostats and their heaters were in that room on opposite sides, and that meantthat theyd fairly often influence each other in odd ways. Eventually, with some adjustmentsto the set points, I got them to cooperate. But then, night fell. With no more sun comingthrough the windows, what would happen? Would the heaters be enough? Yes. They were. The two onthe main level did need to run nearly continuously but the heaters upstairs were cycling on and off all night - by my rough estimation they were only on about 60% of the time. Oh but wait, I don't need any rough estimation, I know exactly how much energy was used during the test! Andthe answer was - drumroll please [extremely brief drumroll] 110.76 kWh, representing an average power draw of only4.61 kW. Excluding the daytime hours, from 8PM to 8AM the heaters drew 61.38 kWh representing anaverage draw of 5.115 kW, or 17,452 BTU/hr. That timeframe was also long after I had made dinner so no additional sources of heat were present. According to my probe the outdoor air temperaturewas between -9 and -11 degrees, which matches nicely to the data gathered at OHare. Thismeans our Manual-J calculation was only 1,500 BTUs/hr off, but since the test occurred withoutdoor temps just a little higher than my design temperatures, I mean Im gonna call that spot-on. Whaddya know, science works! Spread the word! And here is what the indoor probes showus. This probe was placed next to my homes thermostat. During the day, the movingsun and all my fiddling to deal with that caused this dip here but after the sun set themeasured temperature was right smack dab in the middle of what the thermostat and furnace normallymaintains. And in the other two rooms we see the same thing - in fact its even more consistent. Also note that I did not adjust the thermostats overnight - they nicely maintained 69 degreesall night long. So - given that a real-world, actual test with actual data just occurred, Ican state confidently that just a hair over 5 kW is in fact the actual amount of heating outputI need to keep my home comfortable in any weather condition which verifies both what my thermostatwas telling me and what a Manual-J block load calculation determined. So sure enough, my furnaceis more than three times larger than it needs to be. That is objectively silly, but its excellent news. BecauseIm in a townhome which was built assuming everything that could be gas would be gas, even the dryer, Ionly have 100A electrical service. Many folks would consider that an insurmountable barrierto electrification (although, as Ive already covered, there are many ways around that). But inmy case, well now I know that the circuit for my two-ton air conditioner is probably sufficient forthe two-ton heat pump Ill need, and for backup resistive heat, I only really need 5 kW available. That by itself would be sufficient to at least maintain a reasonable set point, but in a modernheat pump system the heat strips and the heat pump will work together, so Ill probably have at least7 or 8 kW of total heat output whenever I need it, which is more than enough. To be clear, itsnot like ditching gas will be painless for me. Ill still need to run a new circuit to thefurnace closet to have backup electric heat, but 5kW of heat strips is only a 20 ampload which makes it much more manageable. \"mmmbut what about the ductwork?\" I hear some of youasking. Since you used space heaters during your test and shut off the furnace, you couldntaccount for any losses from leakage in yourducting! Ah, that's very good point, except no it isn't. Idont have any losses to account for. Why, you ask? Fair warning, Im about to get snarky! See, I am aMidwesterner and I live in a home that was built by my fellow value-obsessed Midwesterners. And ya knowwhat value-obsessed Midwesterners would never in a million years consider doing when designinga homes heating system? Running its ductwork through an attic or a crawlspace. And ya knowwhy we wouldn't do that? Because that makes no effin sense! OK sure, youll find that occasionally around here - sometimes compromises have to be made particularly when, like, doing additions or remodeling. But ya know where my ducts are? Theyre inside the conditionedenvelope! They go through wall and floor cavities all in the center of the structure, not onceever going above the ceiling into the attic, below the floor into a crawlspace or through outside walls. So, any heat thatmight leak out of them ends up where I want it anyway! Its wild! Did you know you could dothat? I know that some builders sure dont. This may come as a surprise, but it turns out that ifyou put ALL the heaty cooly bits inside the place that you're paying money to heat or cool, you get ALLof your moneys worth and not just most of it. And if youre thinking oh, well hes inthe Midwest, hes gonna have a basement - get a load of this - I dont have a basement! My home isslab-on-grade, so my furnace is just in this room! Its in this closet! Just because you dont havea basement doesnt mean it has to go in the attic - or a crawlspace. It never has to go there! Itcould just be here, inside your home, in a closet in a room and all the ducts it feeds can stayinside your home, too! This has always been an option and all it takes is planning a space for thisstuff to live and not making it an afterthought. I feel so sorry for HVAC technicians in parts of thecountry where you stuff all this crap in an attic. Crawling through a little access hatch and tiptoeing on the joists just to read an error code - it could be just right here! Easily accessible in autility closet that's barely any bigger than your average bedroom closet. My water heaters evenin here! And guess what? If my AC drain clogs, it aint gonna ruin the ceiling. Itll justpuddle its way to the floor drain. Imagine that! And ya know what really gets me? This articleon the Department of Energy website makes it sound like this is some kinda revolutionary idea! In recent years, energy-saving designs have sought to include ducts and heating systems in theconditioned space. - pfft, recent years Listen, we figured that one out like forever ago. How hasit taken the rest of you so long? The house I grew up in will be 100 years old before too long andya know where none of its ducts were going? THE ATTIC. Because the people who built it used their brains! And dont give me any crap about ceiling vs. floor vents, \"oh its better to have ceiling vents inwarmer climates\" - First of all, we need plenty of cooling here, too and the floor vents are doing justfine. Its forced air, yknow. Plus, ever heard of a ceiling fan? And if you absolutely insist that they bein the ceiling, you could be running ducts below the ceiling and enclosing them in decorative soffits and ifyoure so vain that youd rather it be pretty than efficient, you probably think this video is aboutyou and also - look up what a plenum truss is. You can have both. There are so many better optionsthan stick the thing up in the attic and make a spaghetti octopus of flexiduct, thatlldo. Thinking about how much energy is wasted and money! just because sticking everything up inthe attic is a bit prettier and cheaper is the kinda thing that keeps me up at night. Maybe youthink thats strange but I think I'm strange, too. Im also a liar! I actually do have two runsof insulated ducting going through soffits in the garage which is an insulated space but nottechnically a conditioned space. Those ducts feed the kitchen registers and, since some heatdoes get lost to the garage through leakage, well that should ideally be accounted for. Now,good news, I did. I will also fight you on whether that run of ducting should count as a loss - ifit keeps the garage marginally above freezing, which it does, then I would call that a usefulloss and is a useful loss even a loss at all? Yeah - chew on that one, philosophers. Anyway,during the test I had yet another heater on yet another thermostatic control to keep the garage at47 degrees, which I know for a fact is warmer than it would ordinarily stay because I run thatsetup (with a more legit plug-in thermostat) all winter and it does indeed need to run fromtime to time. The furnace alone will not keep the garage at 47 when it gets extremely cold. With another energy monitor monitoring energy, I know that from 8 PM to 8 AM, keepingthe garage at 47 degrees entirely with a space heater (and I had my car unplugged,for the record) took 9.76 kilowatt-hours, representing a continuous draw of about800 watts. Thats probably pretty generous, and Ill bet the actual loss from those ductsis closer to 300 watts. Maybe not even that. So. Now comes the part where I ask - why the heckis my furnace so big in the first place? Well, I dont know for sure but Ill bet the HVACcompany hired to install this system just looked at the square footage figure formy home, maybe considered that it was a townhome but could very well not have, then justslapped in whatever furnace the supply house had handy and for cheap which was the next-sizeup from their ol' rules of thumb. Thats actually another problem here - because oversizing agas heating system doesnt matter that much, supply houses can just stock a fewcommon sizes to take care of 99.9% of all the housing stock in their area andthat means they buy a lot of those machines, economies of scale kick in, and everythingis self-reinforcing. It's not great. In the case of my home, I wasnt there for theprocess of speccing the equipment so that is just speculation on my part. But last Spring, I saw thisvery thing - HVAC folks shooting from the hip without any sort of thought - in action. Myparents decided to join the revolution and got themselves a cold-climate heat pump. Likelydue to a combination of the fact that nobody knows what heat pumps are around here and thegeneral character of the builder who built their all-electric home, they never had a heat pump. They just had a big ol air handler with 20kW of heat strips which would come on like a gianthair dryer, and a 3-ton air conditioner provided cooling in the summer. When they inquired abouta heat pump, the sales rep who came out to give them a quote saw that 100A circuit poweringthe air handler and, likely assuming that that was actually appropriate for their home, determinedthat a 5-ton heat pump system would be necessary. But see, they, too, had a smart thermostatin control of their heating system. And by looking at historical data and systemperformance, I determined that the most heat output theyd ever needed was about 10kW, which is 34,000 BTU/hr. In tonnage, thats just shy of 3 tons. The heat pump seriesthey were looking at is capable of maintaining its full rated output at 5 degrees Fahrenheit, and in those temperatures their home probably only needs about 8 kW of heat. Since three-tonswas sufficient for cooling in the summer, and a three-ton Bryant heat pump is supposedlyable to output almost exactly 10kW of heat even at 5 degrees, jumping up to a 5 ton would have just beoverkill. Luckily, I was able to convince the sales rep that a 3-ton system with 15kW of backupheat would be OK. And thats what they installed. And Im very happy (and, to be honest, relieved) to report that I was correct. They had no issues in the summer staying cool, (in fact this systemcan actually produce about 4 tons of cooling despite being classified as a three-ton) and inthat cold snap I ran my test? Well, heres what that looked like for them according to theirthermostat. Even when the outdoor temperature was solidly below zero, their heat pump couldproduce all the heat they needed. To be sure, this was right on the edge - the thermostat was constantly calling for heat and Im sure the heat pump wasnt running very efficiently. But thethermostat didnt call for backup heat until the outdoor temp had hit -12. Only then did the indoortemperature fall three degrees below desired, and thats the point where their thermostatis configured to kick on the heat strips. And even then, it only tickled them a few timesin the dead of night. This cold snap was the only time this winter where the heat strips were truly necessary despite it being extremely cold and despite only having a 3-ton heat pump. A5-ton unit would definitely have been overkill. So why did the sales rep think a5-ton unit would be required? Well, based on how we used to build homes around here, and the general character of weather we get, it makes sense to assume youre going to needmore heating output than cooling, and that assumption would only reinforce using the existing heating systems output as a valid benchmark. And remember, there is at least some benefit tooversizing the heat source - when you hit the design temp outside, a properly-sized heatingsystem cannot get your home any warmer than the indoor design temperature. Thats precisely whatwas going on in the data here - they had reached equilibrium where the heat added by the heat pumpwas exactly the same as the heat leaving through walls and windows so it wasnt making theirhome any warmer despite running constantly. Once it gets colder outside than that equilibriumpoint, then the house starts to lose energy and some secondary source of heat is needed. With afully-electric heat pump system, that secondary source is your resistive backup heat - theheat strips. But if you only have a gas furnace, you usually dont have a secondary heat source. So, rather than explain to their customers that its quite normal for your heat to kindof putter out when its 10 below outside, go get some space heaters if youre too cold, installers can just chuck in a furnace thats a little bit bigger than it strictly needs tobe and avoid complaints. Which, to be honest, is completely understandable. Iget why thats common practice. But heres the rub: everything is changing. Fora start, we have been building homes in a more energy-efficient fashion lately. At least aroundhere. My mom and dads home is about 15 years old, and it actually has the same heating demandin extreme winter weather as it does cooling demand in the height of summer. Ill bet veryfew HVAC people would believe that to be true but it is! I have the data to prove it. And sure enough, my new home is in the same situation. I have a 2-ton air conditionerright now which has proven perfectly fine, and, well, now I know that a 2-ton heatpump will work just fine for heating, too! Remember, thats especially good to know because I only have 100A electrical service. So where does this leave us? Well first, let mesay this to the HVAC contractors of the world: You have got to stop using simple rules of thumb! The world is changing so your habits need to, as well. For one thing, a home built in the1990s or later is a whole different animal from one built 50 or 60 years ago. But also,you cant just be looking at someones current equipment and assuming what they have now isactually correct or necessary. Of course people will be satisfied with a wildly oversized heatingsystem - itll heat just fine, and fast! But just asking does it heat well? isnt enough. At leastaround here, most people have heating systems that are oversized up the wazoo. Which is making heatpumps seem a lot harder than they actually are. As I hope to have shown in this video, there areseveral ways to concretely find out what sort of heating and cooling system you actually need. Youcould do the crazy thing and set up a bunch of space heaters on kill-a-watts. You could also do an actual loadcalculation to work this out on paper. Or you can gather data from a logging thermostat, verifythe heating and cooling output of the equipment its controlling, and actually find out whatsort of heating and cooling was needed in what sort of weather with all of the variablesand vagaries of that homes heating system, building materials, size, orientation tothe sun, all that accounted for in-situ. That worked perfectly for my mom and dad andfor me, too. Of course there are plenty of smart thermostats on the market right now which will let you see this data, and hey, HVAC people, if youre working with a homeowner who has a smart thermostat, you should learn how to get to this data (in case they dont know how) and ask them to show it to you! You are leaving extraordinarily valuable information on the table if you dont look at whats already there. Now, I get it - change is scary, and hard! Itsmuch easier to just do things as youve always done them, and these new heat pump systems are morecomplex with more variables to consider than the furnaces and air conditioners youre usedto. Plus, when you have customer satisfaction to be concerned with, it is often a saferbet to go overboard. In my heart of hearts, I know this is whats happening. Ivespent my time in customer service, and we all know theres a particular kindof customer who just isnt reasonable. That customer will simply never find a properly-sized heating system to be acceptable no matter how hard you try to explain to them that \"yes, actually, it should be struggling when it gets extremely cold outside because itsextremely cold outside! If you need more heat, plug in a heater or maybe just bundle up.\" And theworst part is you dont know who that customer is gonna be until its too late and they callto chew your head off. Trust me. I get it. But we have to push through this. We alldo. Proper load calculations should be way more common than they are these days. Especiallybecause there are more and more tools available to do a lot of the gruntwork for you. Perhapsyouve seen those apps contractors are using where they just take photos of your house andit spits out extremely accurate dimensions. Somebody could build that for HVAC folks and your sales calls would probably impress. Also, for the love of all things holy, be honestwith your customers about what heat pumps are! Yes, theres government money on the table to help people get them but dont be evil thats right, I said evil and exploit that money to pad your bottomline. Help people out. For reference, this is essentially the same equipment that my parents just had installed. Yeah,its a different brand, but the OEM is almost certainly the same. Ever see that Tyler Perrymovie? Midea Builds a Heat Pump? Anyway, this website will ship everything to you, includinga lineset, a thermostat, and the heat strips, for about $4,000. They even sell Mitsubishiequipment for not much more. To be clear, I am not endorsing this product line or website but if a contractor will replace your furnace and AC for you for $5,000 all-in but wants $15,000or $20,000 for a heat pump well maybe show them this? Let them know you know whats up. Even if they need to hire an electrician to run a circuit for heat strips, some of thesequotes I keep hearing about are pretty fishy. Another thing that we all need to consider is whether heat strips are even necessary any longer. With the development of cold-climateheat pumps, in many places they just arent. Heck, theyre barely required here in the frozen tundraof Illinois. Id personally still want them as a backup in case something goes wrong with theheat pump itself, but remember that I kept my house warm with a few space heaters. If I had just setup four of them and left the HVAC fan on to move heat around to the whole house, I mean thatwould work well enough in an emergency! And if you just cant bear the thought of not having a fossil-fuel at your disposal, just get yourself a Little Buddy heater and a grill bottle of propane. Then crack a window open cause thats nasty. I dont really have a clean conclusion here, but thanks for watching anyway. I hope this doesnt come across as too angry at HVAC professionals - you folks in the field all rock! Your companies and their practices well I have my concerns butIm sure you do, too. And I didnt even touch on insulation! Add more of that to your home andall this gets easier! Its no doubt thanks to recent building codes that I can get away witha 2-ton heat pump and my mom and dad, in a big, single family home mind you, can get awaywith a 3-tonner. Theres a lot to do when making any kind of change, but first andforemost you need to see where youre actually at. Professionals could - and Id argue should- do that for you as a matter of course. But hopefully this video gives you some ideas onhow to help yourself. And with that the end. appropriately smooth jazz If my android phone, a Pixel with your own dangSOC, on which I have given the Google Home app full, unrestricted location permission withprecise location and wifi scanning turned on, happens to be on the same wifi network as the Google Nest thermostat which is wired to my furnace and cant possibly moved ahhh!!! kilowatt-hours, representing and average draw of 5.115 kW, or seventeenthousand four hundred fifty [ ] two BTU fuff Theyll be better for our wallettt too. What happened there? and I know for a fact that the winter. Fark! Are simply looking at theequipment that ke fphsasf asf fha! Get a load of this guy, talking about heating loads. He should really try a new heat pump on for size! OK, gonna level with you, running out of puns for this one. GOOD THING I'VE GOT AUXILIARY PUNS! I'm prepared for any condition.",

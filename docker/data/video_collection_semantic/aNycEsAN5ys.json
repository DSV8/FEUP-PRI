    "transcript": "- Are you a man? What is a man? Does a man need a rugged tablet? Dell has been doing this rugged series of devices for a while, they got laptops, they got tablets. Is there a more manly tech video host? - [Andy] No! (laughs) - Thanks Andy. Wait, this is a rugged tablet, right? Brandon, can I damage this table? Here it goes. Ooh! That's a chunky boy. It's like a piece of meat, you can get his hands on that (grunts) And look at all those buttons on the front. Brightness controls, volume controls, and then what looks like customizable buttons. Two cameras up top and it's also got a privacy shade. Hackers can't steal your private construction secrets. Obviously, this is rugged and crazy because it's not meant for the average person its meant for construction workers, scientists out in the field. Wait, what's this? Oh! On this side, we've got a Kensington lock, and what looks like a vent. On the bottom, little pins for the keyboard connector or other type of connectors that you might connect. On this side, ooh, okay, so here's where we get to the IO. Power plug, serial port, I think that's called. I'm assuming that's some sort of specialized connector for specialized equipment. Here we got ooh display port, USB three of some kind, micro-SD card slot, and a headphone, oh, combo jack, headphone and microphone jack, as well as a power button. And then on the back, we've got dual batteries. You can configure it with just one battery or two batteries. Then NFC touchpoint. Oh, and also a rear camera here, also with a privacy shade, wow! Am I missing anything? It's rugged. Okay, where's the power button again? The moment of truth! Is it really a tablet, or is it really just a big giant mock up you might see at IKEA? Fan's going. And then it stopped. These things aren't meant to be intuitive, this isn't an iPad we're talking about here, okay, this is a very specialized piece of equipment. Are the battery's dead? Oh there we go! Now if I was confused by that, I can only imagine what people who aren't super into tech would experience. This thing has a capacitive screen, but the sensitivity has been set way higher, so it will be able to feel your finger through your glove. Let's take out these other accessories here. So this I believe, is the kickstand for it. But before we do that, we're gonna bring out the keyboard. This is a manly show, we don't cut things, we just rip them off! (grunts) Okay, this is the keyboard dock, that is compatible with the Latitude 7220 rugged tablet. I have absolutely no use for any sort of rugged anything, but playing around with these almost makes me wanna just get them because I like the aesthetic of it. I like how thick and chunky it is. And who in their right mind buys something that's just beautiful and shiny, and doesn't wanna throw it on the ground. It almost makes me wanna just get one of these just so I can do that. All right, here we go, how easy is it to attach it? Boom! That was super easy. (laughing) Okay, that's screwed in. It just comes out, boom! All right, that's pretty good. Ooh, whoa, that touchpad is not amazing. They're not looking to be, like, 'Oh, the latency is the smallest it could possibly be'. It's like, if it works, if you're out there and there's like literal sparks and lava flying at you, if you can still use your laptop. 'Can I use the touchpad with gloves?' And you can! Nice job, everybody, we did it. Oh wow, that's some old style touchpad buttons, it's like, mushy. It's got a Intel core i7 8665U, which is a four-core processor, 16 gigs of LP DDR3 RAM, and 512 gig NVME SSD. This is an 11 inch, full HD, anti-glare, glove-compatible display, as we've seen. It's got WiFi six, it's got built in LTE, and as we said, there's the 34 Watt hour lithium-ion batteries. There's a five megapixel front facing selfie-cam, and a eight megapixel rear camera. Oh, it's pretty nice. I mean, there's like no resistance. Oh, so yeah, there's a fingerprint sensor. Nice one, Brandon. The fact of the matter is that because of all the extra protection measures that Dell has built into these things, there's bit of a premium. List price is 4500 bucks but I think right now you can get it for like 3000 something. Is a little steep for the specs that this thing has. That extra value you're getting it in the fact that it can withstand a crazy amount of torture. Apparently, you can store it for seven days in 71 degrees Celsius environment. (laughs) - [Brandon] I think you'd die before that. - You would die, but, I mean, at least you know that, if you died, your laptop would survive and carry your legacy forward. And on the other end of the spectrum it goes down to, you can use it as low as negative 29 degrees Celsius weather. That's crazy. Okay, drop, the drop numbers. This is what we're interested in. Shock: 48 inches transit-drop. We could probably drop this a bunch, right? Ourselves? So, oh-no! Ooh! Oh! Oh! No! (laughing) (laughing continues) - We don't care! Who cares if it, no! Andy! Yeah, it's fine. - Hell yeah. - Hey, well that was fun. Thanks for coming along everybody. At the end of the day, that's kind of the whole idea of these things, right? They gotta take a little bit of punishment. Well, that's about enough of that guys. Thanks for watching. That is a short circuit for you in case you didn't see one before. This is our kind of unboxing channel. If you're looking for LTT, that's a different channel. Why don't you subscribe to this one if you're not subscribed already. We can do some fun stuff together, I know we can. Love you.",

    "transcript": "- Welcome friends to a very special occasion because today we are building the ultimate Ikea gaming setup. Now you might be asking, Ikea gaming setup? And that is because they have a brand new collaboration with ROG, and therefore Ikea wanted to sponsor us to build out not only, a wide variety of excellent gaming accessories and desk setup related activities, but on top of that, we also have a brand new studio, what fortuitous timing so that this very empty, white studio with nothing but the beginnings of our lighting rig, can then be upgraded to instead to do work, power our gaming needs. So, I think we need to start building. - [Cameraman 1] Who's we? - I'm using the royal we here, as in, it's a team effort. - [Cameraman 1] You. - No it's not - [Cameraman 1] You - We're gonna be here. Do you want to go home tonight? - [Cameraman 1] I mean, I don't have a family to go back to so. - [Austin] Okay, touche. Oh no, I just realized, I have to say Swedish words in this video. - [Cameraman 2] You can't pronounce regular English words. - [Austin] I know! I would like to sincerely apologize to our kind sponsors at Ikea for butchering the Swedish language. (Austin groaning) So this is the Uppspel. - [Cameraman 1] Uppspel. - [Austin] Uppspel. - [Cameraman 1] There's no, there's no umlaut. - The Uppspel. - [Cameraman 1] Uppspel. - [Cameraman 2] So this is. - [Austin] I'm gonna build a desk, okay? So what's cool about this is that, ah my funny bone. (Austin laughing) - [Cameraman 2] We love seeing you in pain. - [Cameraman 1] So normally someone would build this on their own, but Austin has enlisted the help of the crew. - [Austin] Yeah, what do you think we're actually going to be here all day? There's a lot to build here and we got to build a whole PC. - [Cameraman 2] I've done more in 12 seconds, then he did in two hours. - [Cameraman 1] That is actually true. - [Austin] Two hours, we've been here for five minutes. - [Cameraman 1] That looks more like a table than what he was doing the whole time. - [Austin] Clearly, since I'm not necessary here, I'll just see y'all when it's done. Enjoy. - [Cameraman 1] Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. - [Austin] I'll just play the games on it. I just have a good time. You all have fun, like ah. - [Cameraman 2] You guys want to see how the real videos go? That's exactly it. - [Cameraman 1] Austin doesn't actually build his PC's. - [Austin] Here's how the video goes. All right, so let's get started. Cut. All right, I'll see you guys later. (bright playful music) - [Austin] So is that full extended? That's, so this is really the size? I mean, I guess it looks about right, huh. - [Cameraman 2] Just go down. - [Crew] I can always get the power squat. - [Austin] Because it's not plugged in yet. - [Cameraman 2] This is so much worse than (indistinct) - [Austin] I'm gaming. I'm a gamer right now. Alright. So now that we've gotten most of the desk put together, it's time to crack open. What I can certainly hope is our tabletop. This looks roughly a tabletop, sized and shaped. Now I've seen what this looks like, and it is a pretty cool design. Now the cool thing about this is it. You actually can build it in one of two ways. You can actually build this and put this together, either with this being the front or the other side, being the front. If you want to have your chair a little bit closer or cable management. So with our desk assembled, we're gonna do a little protection here. As we build the rest of our stuff for no reason, like, ah, no one trusts me to not scratch up our fine new tabletop with a wild power tool usage. That's clearly not going to happen. So why don't we start working on the desk chair next? Oh, let's see. Let's open this up on the floor. Now. Let's say that now I'm like really feel really being paranoid. I don't want to ruin anything. This is what actually is not even that hard match. Spiel seems like a really simple, easy name to say, but I have no confidence in saying anything. That's remotely Swedish. Woo. A little red accent. It's pretty nice. Oh, the kush is real. - [Cameraman 1] You don't even know if that's the part you sit on. - Ooh. The kush is real. Oh, the red wheels actually a nice touch though. That's actually a nice touch. Watch this. Watch this. Watch this. Ready? Ready? - [Cameraman 1] Yeah. - Got it. One end. Thanks Jared. I appreciate the enthusiasm. Ken, how many years did you go to film school for? - [Ken] Four. - [Austin] Did those years of film school teach you how to watch me put together chairs? - [Ken] No. - [Austin] You learn how to elegantly capture the chair building process. - [Ken] Nope. - [Austin] And so we are almost done building. So the next step is to check our ROG PC that we've put together to see if it actually will work. And if it does fingers crossed, we'll be ready to actually start cleaning up. So then we're ready. So that's supposed to do something. Oh, I see RGB. Okay. Okay. Okay. We have power now. All right. Now that we have successfully turned on the power strip. Let us see if this system works. Hey, that's a lot of fans. It's a little loud. That's fine. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 fans. Oh, Hey good. Okay. All right. All right. So at this point we just need to finish up, installing everything on the PC, clean and tidy a little bit and we should be ready. To show off the ultimate Ikea gaming setup. (upbeat music) Welcome to our ultimate Ikea gaming setup. Not only do we have pretty much the entire lineup of ROG Ikea products, but also we've got them incredibly well lit, thanks to Ken who definitely spent several hours getting this set shot. Exactly perfect. And I start moving around and he gets mad at me. Look at this. Look at how smooth my chair is. Do you see? Look, I'm going to do one tilt. Ready? How many spins can I get? That's one, two. The nice things about this chair is that it is incredibly comfortable. Now just the Matchspiel feature fully adjustable armrests and a fully adjustable headrest, but also has that smooth swivel action and the seat in the back rest, all moved together, which actually is legitimately really nice. When you're gaming, you want to sit up straight, you've got the support, but if you want to actually lean back and relax, especially that head rest, man, ah, I can take a nap here after I pwn the noobs. Yeah. So I said that with a straight face. Y'all just have to live with it, what you'll also see is, are incredibly fast standing desks. So right now it's all the way down. But watch this, the dual motor design, that might be one of the fastest standing desks I've ever tried. And the nice thing about this collaboration that Ikea have done with ROG is the fact that you can get all this for a very reasonable price. The value is there, but you've also got the aesthetic, especially if you are a fan of ROG, you get little Easter eggs everywhere between the graphics on like the table legs. And of course, we've gone all out with this setup. So we have a little bit of everything, but you can see that really kind of works well together, which is especially helpful for me because oftentimes I try to design something I'm low. Oh, I don't know. And then either Ken does it or we just let ROG and Ikea do all the work for us and get that sweet, cohesive design also. So the screen, which I find very useful and you also have presets on the desk, so you can have it exactly set up to go like 1, 2, 3, 4, your various different sitting and standing modes. I am personally a big proponent of standing desks. I use one at home. I use one at the office and that is entirely because it feels to me far, far healthier to actually be able to stand while you're working or even while you're gaming. Speaking of the PC, you can see that we have put together a system. Now for this video, we opted to put it on top of the desk. Although there is as part of this, a collaboration with ROG, they actually do have a stand, which is specifically for a computer tower. So if you want, you can kind of get it off to the side. Although considering just how large this desk is, I feel like it actually looks pretty nice to have it all one piece. As you can see, we also have a lot of the other accessories. So we've got what probably is my favorite accessory here. We've got the hand which can hold our ROG headphones. You also have this very cool little ring light and phone combination, which I'm going to switch over to now. So this is what it looks like when I'm recording with my phone using this beautiful ring light. So of course, when you're on a Zoom call or really specifically, if you're a content creator, something like this is a super easy setup to get going. Now, yes, it may not be quite as seamless looking is this beautifully lit footage that Ken has spent hours setting up. But the nice thing is it's an easy way to do a little bit of like Twitch streaming or Instagram live or whatever the case is from the comfort of your brand new desk. It also has a phone holder, as well as the ring light built into one. You can change the color temperature and you can also change the brightness. - [Ken] Most importantly, it has a gooseneck. - [Austin] It does. I, although I will say as with all ring lights, if you were a glasses wearer such as myself, you may want to consider a different lighting selection. - [Ken] LASIK LASIK. - [Austin] No, I don't do LASIK. No, I'm not going to do LASIK. look, here's the thing. Right? Ring lights look great for everyone who doesn't wear glasses - [Ken] Contacts. - [Austin] So you know, some of us like the look of glasses, all three of us are wearing glasses right now. And then if you're feeling like you need a little bit of extra comfort in your life, may I suggest this beautiful pillow, which not only you can easily stick your arms through, but there's a little bit of a secret. I am the gaming master now. I put it on backwards. - [Ken] I put it on backwards. You put it on there. - [Austin] Oh, look, look how comfortable I am now. That's all. I just really want an excuse to pull this out. Oh, nice of this. And I still have my arm holes. The cabinet is also incredibly useful. Not only does it have wheels as well as it has a little headphone holder on the side, but also is a great place to store things like snacks or I don't know, extra gaming accessories. Although I will say having the pegboard does make it really nice to have all of your controllers and extra mice and all that kind of stuff. Nicely displayed. Obviously Ikea are well-known for making furniture. I would bet the majority of those of you who are watching have some kind of Ikea furniture somewhere. But the nice thing is now they've got this gaming line to me. It's such a vibe, right? And I know that the dude with the cactus shirt telling you about the vibe is probably not the number one person I listen to advice for when you put all this together, not just to look nice, but unlike some stuff, which is very gamery, this is a little bit more of a subdued aesthetic. Like the ROG stuff. I think to me, that's just a little bit of texture to things, but it works well together. It's not overly like in your face. Like, ah, that's what it feels like to me. Okay. This is my personal truth. Did a lot of gaming stuff feels like that. And this, this feels like a properly like the atmosphere is really here. This is the thing I really appreciate. So if you're interested in learning more about any of the fine accessories and pieces of product that we have in this video, definitely be sure to go check them out at the link in the description. And of course, huge shout out to Ikea for sponsoring this video, allowing us to go completely crazy and build what I think is really the ultimate Ikea gaming setup. (music ending)",

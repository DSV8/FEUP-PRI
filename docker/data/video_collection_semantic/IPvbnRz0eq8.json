    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and I here with Ro today. - Hello. - This is super exciting. So I guess it's the jelly bean season right now. - Mm-hmm. - And I thought it'd be really fun to taste a bunch of jelly beans. And when I was online I bought so many. I even got some of the, what are they, the Bean Boozled? - Oh those ones are gross. - They're really gross, so I thought that we would warm up to the jelly bean taste test-- - Okay. - And start with some good flavors first. - Ooh. - So this'll be for a separate video. They even have beer-flavored jelly beans. - [Ro] Beer? - [Justine] Champagne? - [Ro] Like stout? - [Justine] This is so strange. - I've never seen those. - Krispy Kreme. - I got so excited, she brought these over, these are little cocktails, and I love pina colada. Look at this, they have strawberry daiquiri, mojito. - There's a lot on there. Do people like jelly beans? 'Cause I don't really like them. I love candy. - I love jelly beans. - But this is not like my go-tos. You do like them? - Yeah I have a little jelly bean bowl. I like jelly beans but usually I don't find these fancy flavors. I just have the little Jelly Belly variety pack. - Huh? - I don't have these like fancy, these are like... For a special occasion. - Well I brought my ax today, my throwing knife. - (laughs) Oh my gosh. - So you open. (laughs) - Why does it have your name in it? - Oh, my friend Suzy-- - Like it's so fancy. - Got it engraved because we always go on adventures together. This is really? - Um, yeah. Justine, what is that for, chopping down trees? - [Justine] It's like a throwing ax. - What do you throw that at, targets? - Tree targets. We've got the Cocktail Classics. Here we go, whoa. - [Ro] Ooh, what drink would you like? Tastes tropical. - Mm, super tropical. That's actually quite nice. - I taste the pineapple. - You do. - And the coconut, I love 'em, that's one of my favorites. - Peach Bellini. - What is that? - Whoa. - Mm. - Okay so remember when I said I didn't like jelly beans. - That's delicious. - I think maybe I didn't realize that I like them. - Oh mojiot, mm, mm, mm. - Whoa. That so far is my favorite. - How are they doing this? - I love mojiots. - This tastes so good. - This is really good. How about Strawberry Daiquiri? - I don't know if I've had a strawberry daiquiri. - Like ever, like a real one? - This tastes delicious. - It's like a-- - It's really good. Is that a strawberry? No wait, that's a Peach Bellini. - It's reversed. - The label are reversed on the back. This is a pomegranate cosmo. - [Ro] A cosmo? What's in a cosmo? It's just like spirits and, what? Cranberry juice? - That one's okay. - I've never had a cosmo. Okay. - I think I have. - Cosmos were my least favorite in this pack. - Yeah. - But all the other ones were perfect. - Mm, the mojito. Definitely my favorite. - Pina colada was my favorite. But they're all-- - We'll save these for you for later. - Okay. - You can put them in your jelly bean bowl. - Oh my gosh, these are going in my jelly bean bowl. - I didn't know that I liked jelly beans. - Aren't they great? - I take back everything that I said. - They're a little chewy. - Little chewy. - But they have great flavor. - I have two fake teeth, so sometimes that causes me trouble. - What happened to your tooth? - I don't know! I just never had teeth that came in when I was a child. - They never came in? - No, they pulled my baby tooth out, and they're like, oops. - You need to come to my dentist. My dentist is great. - [Justine] Wow, this is the Fabulous Five. - Oh, the fab five! What have we got going on here? - So this is what we just tried. (Ro gasping) - [Justine] So this is the cocktail classics. This is a smoothie blend! - Ooooh, what kind of smoothies? We've got berry smoothie, orange smoothie. - This is... Okay, that wasn't so good. That tasted, at first it was good. Now it tastes like spoiled milk. (cow mooing) - What color did you do? What color is that? - I don't know. - Hey wait a minute-- - I think that-- - Orange. You get red? - I think it was that one. - Okay, I'm not gonna eat the red. I'm gonna try an orange. (pensive music) - I don't think I like the smoothie ones. They're like milky. - Here's what's weird is, in the beginning, it has a great taste. The after's a little... - It's like spoiled milk. Ick. Nuh-uh. - Skip the smoothies. There's a color cheat on the back. Give me some mint mint chocolate chip. Here we go. Favorite ice cream flavor. - [Justine] I'll try that one, too. Ew. (Ro grumbling) Oh my god, you're making weird noises. Are you okay? - It's like fake, artificial cream flavor. (Ro fakes vomiting) Ew! - Oh my gosh! - I don't like fake, artificial cream flavor. - That is foul. - [Justine] I'm gonna try birthday cake as well. - Birthday cake ice cream. Don't hit me with that artificial cream flavor. (dramatic music) (Justine spitting) - Ew! - That's weird taste. - Happy birthday, here's a gift. - Happy birthday, Justine. - Trash! Gross, I don't like it. Alright, we should move on to soda pop. Grape Crush, root beer, Orange Crush, 7 Up, Dr. Pepper. I love Dr. Pepper. (Ro gasping) - They have Dr. Pepper? - Yes, I think that this is Dr... No, that's-- - Oh my gosh! And they have root beer and 7 Up. I wanna try Dr. Pepper. I wanna try root beer. Which one did you try? - Dr. Pepper. - How'd you know? They're both brown. - Oh god! (Justine groaning) - [Ro] That's terrible. - That's absolutely disgusting. - Oh, that's terrible. - That tasted like rotten, moldy, soiled... Body parts. - Ew. - Ew! Okay, Dr. Pepper was not good. What are you gonna try next? - I'm gonna try root beer. - Okay. - It's not great. It's really light. That's what I appreciate about the flavor, is that it's like a really light like root beer. Dr. Pepper just had way too much flavors. - Yeah. - Like too much artificial flavor, hitting me in the face. - I didn't like it. Should we try 7 Up? - Yeah. I love 7 Up. - Mmm! Really-- - This is nice. - Oh! - It's super limey. (laughing) - Yeah. - I feel it in my sinuses. (laughing) I'm sweating now. - [Ro] Are these... - They don't taste like the soda, though, I don't feel like. - No, that was so limey! - What do you call the soda? - I think it depends who you're talking to. And what they say. I'll try the grape one. - Nuh-uh, I'm not even going near the grape. I'll do orange. - Actually, grape is nice. - Orange isn't bad. It's really hard to mess up a jelly bean. - Clearly it's not that hard. - These aren't even the gross jelly beans. - Those are in the bag. I can't even imagine-- - These are supposed to be the good jelly beans. - These are the citrus mix. - Like Sunkist the juice. - I'll try a lemon. Lime is good, or-- - Better. - Lemon. I don't even know what I'm tasting. They all taste the same. - Sunkist, better than the sodas. - I'm gonna try the grapefruit, even though I don't like grapefruit at all. - I don't like grapefruit either. - It's really, like-- (Ro gasping) - We just bonded. - We did. - We just had a moment, everybody. - We had a moment. - And you guys saw it on camera, but we both don't like grapefruit. (Justine fakes vomiting) - Samesies! Why is it so sour? - I don't know. - They're almost like Sour Patch Kids sour, isn't it? - Ew, it is, yes, ew. - It's a lot. - Bye-bye. - It's a lot, whew! - Fabulous Five is down. - [Ro] Yeah. - I think that-- (Ro gasping) We've been having so much fun with those little box containers that we should really get super silly! - [Ro] Oh my gosh. These are supposed to be champagne flavored jelly beans. - [Justine] And these are the beer flavored jelly beans. - [Ro] Little stout! Let's see if they actually taste like... Do you think it's going to be a lite beer, or dark beer brew? - This looks like kind of a lite beer, I would say. - What kind of a port is it? - Oh, that stinks. - Smell that. - It's smells-- Girl, what is it? Like a dark-- - Ick! - Oh! - [Justine] Ew. - Ew! - Should we do beer first? - It smells like dirt and yeast. I just really-- - Oh, look how pretty they are, though. - This looks like champagne, like it looks all pretty. - Do we do beer first, because it's probably gonna be disgusting? - Let's try beer, and then I'll wash the taste out with maybe one of these. (soft, pensive music) - That does not taste like beer. - No. - I actually like this. - It's really good, and then it's really light. I mean it's... Why does it smell so bad, but it tastes just fine? - I'm surprised, actually. I thought this was gonna be disgusting. - It's not. - No, it's good! - Put that in your bean container. - Whoa, that just blew my mind. I was not expecting that after the smell. Champagne, are you ready? - Champagne dreams. - Cheers? Cheers! - Mm. - Sweeter. - I like it. - It's so mild. - Yeah, the ones that I thought were gonna be trash are really good! These might be my favorite jelly bean flavors, because it's very light. - It's so light. It almost tastes like... Like a grapefruit juice. Like a white grapefruit juice. - [Justine] I love it. - [Ro] Like a really light. Alright, we're gonna switch it up. Okay, what's this? - Spice flavored. - Spice? I'm a little scared. - Okay, jelly beans are pretty. I think I'm starting to like jelly beans. - They're really cute. - [Justine] So this is from a different company. This isn't the Jelly Belly. This is from Just Born, which they also make Hot Tamales, and Peeps, and Mike and Ike's. - Ooh. - Just Born. I got a red one. - I'll do it with you. - Oh! - Hot. - Hot! (coughing) - That's hot! It's like a Hot Tamale jelly bean. - I forgot that's spice. It's spice! (spitting) We definitely tried the red one, which is cinnamon. And now I've found the flavors. White is peppermint. I would use that to counteract. - It's good. - Oh, that one's real minty. - It's really minty, it's really strong. If you want strong flavored jelly beans. - Oh, Just Born. - They taste like fresh and strong. - Okay, so the yellow one is clove. - Clove? - I can't tell if I love it or hate it. I'm not sure. - It's strong, wow. Wow, what? - It's a weird taste. - It reminds me of the holidays, you know? Because I always but cloves and nutmeg and ginger in together, like when I'm making spice cookies for the holidays. - Yeah. I wanna make a flashback to us making holiday videos. (laughing) Alright, I'm gonna put this around the tree. - Okay. (laughing) Justine, you got me in there. (laughing) Justine, wait! (laughing) Look at all these muscles! - My goodness. - It goes really good with these pants, so I left them on. What's the other one? - Okay, so spearmint is green. - Okay. - I like spearmint. - I'm a blow. Are you a mint, or a spearmint kind of a person? - I love spearmint. - Did you say vinegar? - Winter green. - Oh! (laughing) I thought you said vinegar. I was like... - That wouldn't surprise me. - What the heck's a winter green. - I don't know. - Why if it's called winter green? It's pink. - Because they ran out of green. I like this. - It's really good. - I like winter green. Next up I think that we should try these Krispy Kreme Donut flavors. (gasping) - Oh my god, I love Krispy Kreme. - They also come in this bag as well. It's basically the same donut flavors, but they are rocks. - Okay these are like pretty displayed. We have original glazed right in the middle. And then we have a glazed blueberry cake, a chocolate iced with sprinkles, strawberry iced, and then a cinnamon. What is this, a cinnamon? - She can't open it fast enough. Oh my goodness. - Cinnamon. I see the first ride of cinnamon! - Do you need help? - Yes. - [Justine] Alright, go for it. - Why can I not open anything? Cinnamon apple fill. - [Justine] Wow! - Look at those pretty pretty over here. - Ooh. - Ooh! This shot, this is pretty. - [Justine] Which one, do you want to try the glazed first? - Yeah. - Since it's a classic. - Yes, I have... The original glazed. I wanna know, does this taste like a straight-up donut? (dramatic music) - I don't like it. - I hate it. (fake sobbing) - Ick! - That does not taste like a donut. - That was an absolute lie. You're disgusting. - Okay, if you guys get these, you'll know what we're talking about. That does not taste like a donut. (fakes vomiting) - Which one do we try now? - I'm like really sad now. Like are any of them gonna taste like donuts? - I don't know, let's try the strawberry. Strawberry iced. - Okay, let's do strawberry. - That one's nice. It's a little creamy. - It's better than the first one. - But if that is what we're basing all of these off of? - I think there's like an underlying flavor, like the \"donut\" flavor doesn't taste like donuts. - No. - Because if it's mixed with any of these, it's just gonna be weird. - Mm-hmm. - What about your blueberry one? - Oh, no, is this gonna-- - Blueberry glazed donut. - Is this gonna ruin all my hopes and dreams? - Let's try. Uh-oh, uh-oh! - Okay, it's like fine. - It's okay. - Sub-par. - Do any of these taste like a donut? - Why are you doing this to us? - Look, there's sprinkles in there. My mouth feels funny. - What's your favorite kinda donut ever made? - Honestly, I like these cake donuts. Like that type of like... - Like the old fashioned with the glaze? - Yeah. - Those are great. - Or like those French donuts. - I like, yeah, those or chocolate covered donut, or a maple bar. Chocolate, let's see. Mm, no, that's not a chocolate donut. - Okay, we've got one more. It's the cinnamon apple filled, and you were hyped about the cinnamon. This is like-- - Girl! - Christmas morning-- - Give me something. - and Santa decided to not go to your house. - This is like a got a lump of coal in my stocking. But he wrapped the coal, you know? Wrapped it, so I thought, ooh, this could be something. And then you open it, and it's like... (groaning) - This one's okay. It's just okay. Well, I'm disappointed. I don't wanna see these again. - Krispy Kreme, you have great donuts, but the jelly beans are not for me. - Not for me, maybe it's for you. - [Ro] What have we got? - We've got two more. - Okay, I'm getting excited again. - We've got holiday favorites, which these potentially could be expired because the holiday is way over, but. - Oh, you'll be fine. They're jelly beans! - I don't know! I ordered all this stuff from Amazon to do an Oreo unboxing-- - Yeah. - Everything was expired. - No! - And this conspiracy, I had these Oreos with the mega-stuffed ones. But there was like three cookies missing. Yeah. - [Girl In Blue] That doesn't even count. That doesn't even have a mega in it. - No, it doesn't. - We have been misled. - [Justine] Someone definitely ate a cookie. Somebody ate like three cookies. Somebody ate a couple cookies. - [Justine] Look at that, the other half of this isn't even there. - I'm upset! - Somebody-- - Are you kidding me? - Had their little mitts in my cookies. - Welches, Welches? - Grape. - How do you say Welchers? - Welchers's? - Welchers's? Welcher's. - [Justine] Family-farmer owned. Yeah, so let's try the grape. - Mmm. I like them. - I like this. - I like these. - So this is a different brand as well. So which one do we think is the strawberry? - I was gonna say, I don't like grape flavors, but I like this brand of grape. - This is a good grape, yeah. Because it's family farmer owned, obviously. - This is my first brand of grape I've ever liked. Wow. - Today's the day. Oh, they also do strawberry really well. - Mmm. - Mmm. - Those are great. - [Justine] So full of flavor! - [Ro] Whoa. - Wow. White grape peach. - Mmm, that's good. - Oh, that is good. - Mmm, that's really good. - Oh my god. - What about these red ones? - Oh my gosh. I think the yellow is the white grape peach. - That's good. - Wow, these are my favorite so far. - My favorite jelly bean. Put them-- - Right here. - In your jar. - These are going in the good bowl. - Wow, these were so good. - Mmm. - Did we try them all? These are my favorite. - These are really, really good. I don't even know which one's my favorite flavor out of them. - God, you gotta give me your dentist's number, because I need to go after this. - [Ro] I've got a great dentist. He's amazing. - I may be going into so sort of, like... Sugar coma. - Same. - I'm not sure. We may be, posting this grim story from the emergency room after this. - Justine, I'm leaning away from you. - Holiday favorites. (Ro gasping) - [Ro] I love the holidays. - [Justine] Me, too. Oh my gosh. - [Ro] Okay, what? Oh my gosh, they have eggnog. They have candy cane. - Cranberry sauce? Pumpkin pie. - [Ro] Pumpkin pie? (both gasping) - Remember when we tasted all those pumpkin flavored things? (laughing) (dramatic music) (smacking) - It taste like a naked Dorito. - They're really good. And I was like, come over. I have a few pumpkin things to try. I had like 26 things. - [Justine] A smorgasbord. - I was like, oh sorry, I hope you were hungry. Oh my gosh! Okay. - Ooh. (dramatic music) I'll put that one away, to never be tasted again. I don't like it. - That doesn't... - It doesn't taste good. It was like a spicy rot. A spicy rot. Hmm. - Ick, ew. - We're over it, ew! - Over it. - Pew, gross! - [Justine] Candy cane. - [Ro] Okay, candy cane. You better not a little mess up nit. - Oh, yeah, that's nice. - Mmm, that's really nice. - It's like a piece of candy cane. - Mm-hmm. - Tastes like a piece of gum. - It's nice after you just have kind of a weird tasting one. - Yeah, it really cleanses. - It kind of cleanse, yeah. It's, hoo, nice and fresh, okay. - So eggnog, I don't really like eggnog to being with. - See I like eggnog. - So you tell me if this tastes like eggnog. - Okay, I have a really good eggnog cake recipe. - Oh. - It's delicious. (dramatic music) - It's fine. - Actually, I'm gonna give it a medium. - It's fine. - It's like... - I'm not that into it. - Mm-hmm. - I'm not gonna be like, wow, I really wishing I had some eggnog jelly beans right now. - No, no, it's not bad. - Cranberry sauce. - I love it. - Oh! - I couldn't-- - Let's-- - ruin everything. - Make a jelly bean cranberry sauce. - I have a great recipe for these, too, by the way. Just throwing it out there, everybody. It's fresh, it's good. That just tastes like a cranberry. - It does! - But like a candy cranberry. - Yeah, they're super sweet. - What do we have next? - We have one last one. This is our final bean. (Ro gasping) - The final bean! - And it's hot chocolate. - Oh my gosh! - Ah! Okay. - That is so cute. - Cheers, the final bean! - Little hot cocoa. (groovy music) - Yeah. - Tastes like chocolate. - It does. I have a stomach ache at this point. - Are you serious? (laughing) - I thought this would be so easy because they're so small. - Yeah. - But there's a lot of these. - Okay, can I just say, this adds up. - [Justine] This really does add up. - I mean, the amount of sugar we probably just ate is a lot. We probably had a bagful. - No, I don't know, let's not think about it. So I think probably my favorite one was the mojito. I really liked the mojito one a lot. - It was so good, nice and minty. - Yeah. - I liked the pina colada one. And then my favorite bag was the little juices. - [Justine] You guys, if you're gonna get any of these, I would get the juice ones. - Yum! - Those were so good. Also, the size comparison of this bean as opposed to the Jelly Belly ones, they're a little bit bigger. - Yeah. - So you've got a little bit more of a taste per bean. - And you get a lot. (kissing) - I am so glad-- - Justine, this was a great video idea. - I decided not to bring in the gross ones. (gasping) - Should we do a video? - We're gonna have to do a follow-up in three months because I need to detox first. - Okay. - Well guys, thank you so much for watching. Ro, thank you so much for eating all of this sugar with me. - Thank you for bringing this over. I have a major sweet-tooth, so any time you want to try weird candies or any flavors, I'm in. - So-- - Count me in. Call me, I love it. - This is great. Well, go check out Ro's channel; I'll link the description. We have so many fun videos that we've done together. And that's it; we'll see you guys later and let us know if you want us to taste the gross beans. (gasping) - Oh my god. (Justine fakes vomiting) (fakes vomiting) (groovy music)",

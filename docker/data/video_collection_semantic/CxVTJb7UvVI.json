    "transcript": "- Hey guys, how are (laughing).. (beep) Hey guys, it's Justine. - And I'm Jenna. - Today, we're gonna make a birthday cake for our dog. - Matty. - This originally was a video Jenna was gonna make for her channel and she's like, you can make it for your channel. - You can make it, I don't mind. - His birthday is on June 17th, which is probably today. Hopefully I post it on the day of his birth. We don't even know if that's his birthday. - No, we just, it's the same as our dad's birthday. And when we did the math, it kind of lined up, so we're like, meh, same birthday. - We adopted Matty from a shelter five years ago. I can't believe it. - But we're gonna make him a dog-friendly birthday cake. - So what do we need, Jenna, since you picked out all these ingredients? - Well, I ordered them online and they showed up, but we have flour, applesauce, Greek yogurt, peanut butter, baking soda, oil. Oh, and pumpkin puree, which Matty hates pumpkin puree, but it's very good for dogs and their digestion, so I feel like this is a good way of kind of tricking him. These are such cute little pans. - Those are rose. - I know, they're really cute. - I have made a mistake here, silly. Oh, what am I doing? - This is a two cup cup. Two cup cup, - Two cup cup, - Two cup cup, - [Both] Two cup cup - This is gonna be a lot of cake. This is a very organic kibble cake. That's a lot extra. - Hold on, look. - Don't put your that's not-- - Look. - You're not supposed to pack it. Two cups. Two cups. Stop. - That's fine. - Two cups. - I didn't pack it. - You can work on the wet ingredients. - Okay. - One eighth cup vegetable oil. So an eighth and an eighth would be, we'll just put two eighths. This is so ridiculous. Could you imagine being a math teacher? Could you imagine being me? Wait, do I put this in here? Oh, good thing it's for a dog. - One half teaspoon. One half teaspoon. - One, I did the oil. - Okay. - Half cup pumpkin puree. Oh no. - How much do we need? We need a full cup of pumpkin puree. - Yeah. - I love pumpkin. I wanted a pumpkin pie the other day, but they weren't out because it's June. Okay, that sounded pretty gross. - All right, we need a half cup. (dishes clattering) - [Jenna] Have you checked this dishwasher? That's nice. Okay, it's not in there. (laughing) I found the half cup. - Please, I'm so weak. My grip strength has gone in quarantine. - She loosened it up for me. - Ah, Jenna. I'm deleting this video. - You should. Ah, what is wrong with you? - Okay, I'm gonna put in two eggs. I should be going in order of like these things. - Are you reading what you're actually supposed to be doing? - No, I'm putting it all in a bowl. - Mix together vegetable oil, peanut butter, apple sauce, pumpkin puree. Is there anything extra in there? - Well it said not to put the eggs until later, but-- - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Birthday cake for Matty Whoa! - Are you waiting for me? - I don't know anymore. - This smells incredible. - It smells really good. - It's my favorite peanut butter. Look at this. - Yeah, it's-- - What's the word, viscosity? - Eh, hey Siri, define viscosity. - [Siri] Viscosity means the state of being thick, sticky, and semi-fluid in consistency due to internal friction. - I really want to eat applesauce and peanut butter now. - You do whatever you want. You're an adult. - So once those are combined, we combine the dry ingredients with them. I have to do it gradually, I think. - Okay, yes, hold on a second, let me... The viscosity swirl. Put that in there. - Sticky fluid. - Okay, stop, I don't, we don't, stick that in there. - Oh, I thought you were talking to Tyler to edit that out of the video. (both laughing) - Since I've been live streaming, it has been bringing out my absolute, just insanity. - Bringing it out? - Well, yeah, but like I can subside it when I'm making YouTube videos. But now that I've been live streaming, like I'm a lunatic. - You're just learning this? You're fine. This is who you are. - I know. - [Jenna] This is what people signed up for 13, 14 years ago. - Yeah. All right, this looks pretty viscous. The viscosity looks pretty good. (popping) (both laughing) What now? - I'm trying to find that. Pour mixture into an eight inch round pan. - Don't even think you're doing this. - Didn't even want to. - Because every time you don't do a good job. - You're being dramatic. I'm gonna brush my hair. I just don't feel pretty. - Why the heck? Why are there so many pans over here? We're making one simple, small cake. - [Both] Okay. - Let's put it in. - Wow, that's greasy. Greased up. - Is that enough? - Yeah. This kinda looks like, kind of looks like his belly issue. - Yeah, this is not-- - That he's been having. - This isn't like an excitng cake that you wanna like lick the batter. - Have you tried it? I'll try it. What's in here, pumpkin, egg-- - It's fine, it's all edible. It's all like human. There's no sugar, so it's probably like, other than the applesauce. - Very bitter. - Okay, so-- - I did not like that at all Justine. Well, it's lingering on my tongue. You try it. - No, I'm good, I don't want it. - You ave to try the lingering taste. - No, I don't wanna. Why are you making me do things I don't want to do? - I really didn't like it. - How long? - I don't know. - Oh my God, what does it say? Bake approximately for 25 to 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with, it's basically the same as a cake. - Hey Siri, set a timer for 25 minutes-- - Wait, we have to put these in there-- - Or until a toothpick-- - No. I cannot get that taste of this out of my mouth. We have to make the icing. - Oh, so I'll clean this and then-- - This just looks-- - I'll make the icing-- - Like baby vomit. - Now we're gonna make the icing. This is for doubling the recipe, so it says half cup, plain Greek yogurt, but we're gonna obviously double it. - Did you guys know that we were doubling the recipe? - So we're gonna double the recipe, so it's a half cup. - No, that's a whole cup. Well, yeah, that's a whole cup. - We need a whole cup. We do, cause we're doubling the recipe. Matty better appreciate us. He's so little. He's just one little dog. (Justine screaming) Here we go, here we go. - Put that peanut butter in. That's a lot of peanut butter. It is a lot of peanut butter. - Like we can't let him actually eat a lot-- - Well he can't eat the whole thing, he'd have literally like one tiny little bite. How's it going? Do you want a different mixing utensil like a-- - I don't know, maybe-- - Like a fork-- - This is fine. - Oh. - Oh, they look really cute. - Smells lovely. - Should we, should you take those other ones out? The little guys? Like, do I put this in the fridge now? I should probably put it in the fridge, right? - I can't use my foot, that would be hot. - Should I put it in the fridge? I'll use my foot. - This is a very, not yet, oh. This is where I am now. Do you have a toothpick? Crunchy. - It's not crunchy. - Oh, su, oh God, that's disgusting. I don't like it at all. Not a single bit do I-- - It's not that bad. - What? - It's way better than the cake. - Hm, no, that's not ready. - It's not ready. - When you see us again, we'll be icing the cake. That's just so I could segue out, so we don't have to like, you know. (jazzy music) Ugh, get out of here. The cakes were out of the oven. I have to shut the oven off. The oven's off. - I turned the oven off when we took the cakes out. - We took the cakes out of the oven and now we're gonna ice them up. We just took Matty for a walk and we told him there was gonna be treats at home. - He's staring at it. Come here, buddy. Come here. - [Justine] You have a stick on your mouth, - You have a stick on your face. Let me get that. You want to keep the stick there? I was going to flip it. You shoulda-- - Whoa! - What? - This way. - Yeah, do you wanna do a little? - No. No. It's for the-- - Yeah, but to make it like flat. Well while you do that, I'll work on his treats. - Okay. - It's a little paw print. That's really cute, Matty, this is gonna be so exciting. - Yeah, we're just gonna let your chow down. I'm, oh my God, I miss icing cakes. Icing cakes to me is so therapeutic. I absolutely love it. - It's my least favorite. - I used to spend so much time-- - It's my least favorite-- - Icing cakes to make them perfect. - You wanna smell it, see if you're interested? Come here. Come on, little bear. It's your birthday cake. Do you think he knows it for him? - I don't know if you know if he knows that's for him. - This is for you, bud. - Is that look good, buddy? - That's for you, bud, that's for you. - He's gonna definitely have the squirts tonight. Just give me a couple minutes, I'm gonna just ice this up. - [Jenna] Do what I want, what I want with my body. We have regular candles. Matty, you want one candle for your birthday? You can't even blow it out, 'cause you're a dog. Alright, Jus, I think you did a good job. We've gotta move on. - I'm not done yet. - Okay, you're doing a good enough job, stop. - But it's not done yet. It's not perfect. - It's perfectly fine. - Here, I'll, it'll come around to you. - Oh my God, he's going to be six. You're six years old. - Oh my God, that's perfect. And look, we can put one right on top. Ah! (both yelling) Matty, it's your birthday, lemme wash my hands. (both talking to Matty) - We're not going to light it for you. - Okay, take your candle out. - Okay, go look. Look, she's cutting it for you. - It's layered. - I mean, can we just talk about my icing skills? - Wait. You're weird. That's good, good boy. - Good job, bud, get your treat. You're being brave. (jazzy music) Good job, buddy. - Okay, look what she's doing. That's a lot. - That is a lot, oh my God. - Happy birthday. - Happy birthday, - [Both] Yay! - [Jenna] All right, I'm gonna try it. - [Justine] I'm not, it looks good, but that's not good. - You like this? - Happy birthday Matty, you're five years old. - You're terrified of plates. - He is afraid of plates. It doesn't make sense. - Good boy, sweetheart, come here, - Everybody go wish Matty a happy birthday on Instagram. His Instagram is DJminimatt. - And he's an angel and he is five. - He's five. He's perfect. - Also everybody.... - What? - Follow us on Twitch. - Follow us on Twitch. We also have a Discord server. I'll put all the links in the description. Okay, happy birthday, bud, we love you. - There you go, go be free. Go be free. Go be free. - It took four hours. (jazzy music)",

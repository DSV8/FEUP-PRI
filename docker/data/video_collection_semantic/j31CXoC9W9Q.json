    "transcript": "- This is hard, okay, it's hard. That's not bad. - [Matt] That is horrifying. - [Ken] What do you mean, not bad? - Today, we are going to be building our own custom characters in \"Saints Row Boss Factory\". So our good friends over at AMD wanted to sponsor this video to give us a sneak peek at the brand new \"Saints Row\" game before it comes out, specifically by building our characters for it. So I have imported my favorite characters, Ken and Matt. So while Matt is building the character, us on the couch get to heckle. - Haggle? - Heckle. - Oh, heckle. - Wait, Matt, have you already started? You know what? Matt's just as fast at starting things as AMD is at giving you a great new game bundle, which comes with the new \"Saints Row\", \"Sniper Elite V\", as well as \"Forspoken\". Check out the link in the description. - Go. - All right, you're gonna start with the skin tone, okay. - I feel like I won't know until the face. - The face is definitely what you want, right? - The face is the giveaway, right? - I go from top to bottom. Some of these go. - [Austin] Dude, witch head, witch head, witch head. - [Matt] I can't find the one I need. - Does he play Frisbee? - He does play Frisbee. - Yeah. - What? The first one's Marques? I can't believe you got Marques as the first one. That's not even fair. I thought you would get like Aristotle or something. - [Ken] I don't even know who Aristotle looks like. - Three, two, one, go. - This guy is like, no, no, yes. (bleep) Yeah, I feel like- - Well, don't say that, 'cause you're gonna have to talk to this dude later. Okay, so I could randomize the face. Let's do that. That's not helping. (group laughs) - Do we want nipples or not, Ken? Do we have nipples or not? - [Ken] Yes, yes. - Are they forward presenting, though? - [Ken] Oh, wait, that's it. - To me, this is like a Dead Ringer for Armando. - [Ken] Yeah, it looks like Armando more than it does this person, but this is as close- - [Austin] Joshua Vergara? - No, Kyle. - Kyle? That's not bad, that's not bad. - [Ken] I was the closest I could get to Kyle. - That's not horrible, but like there is zero chance that you're gonna get this. - [Jared] I think, no, this is gonna really bad. - Watch me surprise you. - All right, all right, all right. - [Matt] Amber Heard. - I haven't even started yet. Oh, I can do this one, I can do this one. - [Matt] You can't start yourself. - Okay, randomize. Wait, wait, wait, no, let me go to, oh. - [Ken] Oh, no, wait, Pete Davidson. - Yeah, that looks like Pete Davidson. - No, no, that's closer, I might do that one. - Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. - Tech Jesus. - MetalJesusRocks. - [Austin] Nope. - [Ken] Jared Leto. - [Austin] No. Okay, so here, here, this'll be the big tell right here. I'm just gonna go all. - Whose massive wiener are you trying to show us? (group laughs) - [Austin] This is actually, oh, no, nope, that's not no. - [Matt] Jared Leto on (bleep). (group laughs) - [Jared] Two, one. - Norman Reedus? - [Austin] Incorrect. - Oh, it's- - [Austin] Ken, do you know it, do you know it? It's Neo. (group cheers) - There it is, I did it, I did it. (group laughs) - [Jared] Go. - Okay, I'm actually gonna say that I'm pretty spot on on this one. - Hillary Clinton. - It is not Hillary Clinton. - Gwyneth Paltrow? - It is not Gwyneth Paltrow. (bleep) - [Ken] Oh, whoa, that's Ray Trace on. - [Austin] Who is it? - It is iJustine. - [Austin] Justine, what? - I think I did pretty good. - [Austin] That's pretty good actually. - Oh, (bleep) Christ, really? - [Matt] This looks like Jackets. The guy who sells drugs at a private school. - Hold on, hold on, hold on. Oh, he needs a hat, he needs a hat. - [Jared] Two, one. - [Austin] It's too late Ken. - I got nothing. - I got absolutely nothing. - I still say Jeremy from Third Period who used to sell drugs. - The other thing is that the hair definitely doesn't poof out with the hat. - [Austin] Ash Ketchum? You know with the jacket, the hat, now I see what he was going for. - That's tough, dude. Last time I thought I did pretty good. - Yours looked like the Madame Tussauds version after a fire. - [Austin] I'm gonna go with- - [Matt] Is it somebody we know? - Uh, yeah. Slightly. That's not, he doesn't have the tattoo, but that's a hint. - Jeff Septiside? - Who is Jeff Septiside? - That's not bad, right? - It's gonna be like PewDiePie or something. Okay, who is it? - [Austin] Mr. Beast. - No, get out. No, no. - Get out. - It's not far off. - Are you kidding me? - When you're doing one of these, what you gotta go is for defining feature. What do we got? - Lamarr Wilson? - This is gonna be the easiest one, if you guys don't get this. Skinny, there we go. - Linus? - It's Austin when he stopped working out. - Can you change the background to an apartment burning? That'd be pretty fire, but- (group laughs) - Do they have, hey guys, as an emote? (group laughs) - That one looks pretty good. We could do that one. - You just looked at me and said, yeah, it's me - It's definitely still Austin. - It's still me. - [Matt] And then- - Eminem? - It's Logic. - Logic, oh no, Fantano. Fantano, yes. Yes, yes. The yellow. Oh. - I knew you guys were gonna guess Austin, constantly. So I'm winning right now because I'm the only one that you guys have got that anyone has guessed. - Oh, yeah, right. It's not the guesser, who wins. - We're not trying to trick you. We're trying to make something that you guys can figure out. - [Jared] Go. - Bill Clinton. - We'll keep the skin tone, figure, I actually don't know what his figure is, 'cause I always see him like- - PewDiePie, doesn't have legs. Yeah, what category? - [Austin] Yeah, help us out? - [Ken] He's a YouTuber. - Wait Vsauce, Michael. - [Ken] Yes. - [Austin] That's it? Really? - Yeah, yeah. - [Austin] Wait, that's Michael? - Well 'cause I couldn't get the face right. They don't have this. - I don't deserve a point for that one. Look at the power of that Radeon 6950 XT, man, this game looks beautiful, thank you very much. All right, everybody ready? - [Ken] Yeah. - What the, Jared! - [Matt] Here we go. - Jared, I cannot do this one. Okay, all right. Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna go with that. There's so many options for noses that we need. Who needs this many nose options? I need an overall. Is there an overall? - Overalls? - I feel like you're creating just a (bleep). - [Austin] No. - Is this from Last of Us? - No, no, no, no. This is a character from a game who does not have normal body proportions. If I had more time, I would make them much shorter. Okay, here we go. (group laughs) - You know, it's Mario. This looks more like Mr. Beast than his actual Mr. Beast, one. - All of mine have been dead on. I don't know what you're talking about. You guys- - I've had some hard ones. - You did not get hard ones. - [Austin] Michael Jackson. - [Ken] Bezos. - [Austin] Jeff Bezos, Jeff Bezos, yeah that's a good one. - Ah, I'm down with that. I'm down with that. - [Austin] Me, me, me? - [Matt] No not everything's about you. - [Austin] Obscure '90s movie. Michael J. Fox. Let's go, let's go. - [Austin] Marty McFly? - Let's go Back to the Future. - The red jacket. - Back to the Future. - I like Ken looking sad. - [Ken] Scroll, scroll. - If we had memorized the hair, it'd go a lot faster. - Elon Musk? No, it's not Elon Musk. Oh my God. - This is why I said we can't have super famous people. Because we just guess, oh. - I mean, I think I just immediately get a point. - I mean, Austin is playing the smart game. I think if you just yell names, you'll eventually win. - Exactly, I'm waiting, oh, okay. (bleep) you Jared, this hairstyle does not exist in this game, I will tell you it does not exist. I blame Jared directly for this one. - [Matt] Some obscure YouTuber that no one's gonna have heard of. - [Austin] No comment. Okay, all right, that face. I actually feel relatively good about. - Why is it always the groin? This one will make sense. All right. All right, here we go. We're gonna go skinny. We're gonna- - What? No, Nope, Nope. - [Austin] Go back here. - [Matt] I'm gonna give you credit. This looks like a real human being, but- - Yeah it should, I hope so. You know what I'm calling it, that's good. - Yeah, get close, get close. Look at Jared's face. Jared knows the answer to this and he is trying not to die right now. - This is, this is actually burning me. And I don't want you to tell me because I'm gonna be so disappointed. - He's trying to say it's him? - [Ken] It's not Austin. - It's not Austin. I can't tell you anything else though. - [Ken] Jared did he actually make it spot on? - I'll give you a hint, 2010. - [Ken] Is it Jonathan Morrison? - It's not, I would consider a dear friend though. - From 2010? Who the (bleep) is it? - You know four people in your life. And you're gonna tell me that this thing is a dear friend of yours. No, this is Austin. - Go ahead. - It's old. - This is 2010 Austin. - duncan33303 baby. (group laughs) - [Ken] That's stupid. No, but where's the fro? - None of this is, this is so bad. - Sounds like a bunch of sour grapes over here. If you're a fan of sour grapes, then you'll probably enjoy the brand new \"Saints Row Boss Factory\" available right now at the link in the description. So definitely be sure to go and check out those shiny new Radeon graphics cards that can create masterpieces like this. Ah, I'll take no cred, really, it was the power of the GPU and not my artistic capability here. - All the power in the world, and that still looks like, yeah",

    "transcript": "- Hey, guys! How's it going? It's Justine, and today I am doing a very, very, very highly requested video. I've been avoiding doing this, but every time I post a video about anything, you guys want me to do a what's on my apple watch video. I never really thought about doing it because I feel like I don't really use that many apps on here, so I'm gonna split this into kind of two different categories. First part is gonna be the apps that I use most, and number two will be just all of the apps that I have on my watch currently. This is usually the watch face that I use. The number one thing that I use this for, surprise, is to tell the time. I also use it for scheduling, because I can just do a quick little glance, and I can see what my day looks like, if I have a call or a meeting. Everything is right there and easily accessible. I also really like this watch layout because it gives me a lot of information all in one screen. I have news, I have my workouts, I can also see a photo. It'll tell me when I have to breathe, and it'll tell me tomorrow's events plus the current weather. Another thing that I really use my Apple watch for is the fitness tracking. If I'm on a hike, even though I don't watchOS 5, so I can't really track that yet. I love being able to track my fitness activity because it also sometimes then turns into a competition with my sister or my friends. So if you've allowed some of your friends to view your activity, they can give you comments anytime you complete something. So it's definitely fun and encouraging if you are one of those competitive type people. Looks like Adam has completed his goal 113%. My sister's husband, Bryan, Bres Bryan. I haven't changed that since before they got married. He had clearly stopped wearing his. Ed, 70%. Jenna, 99%. She's so close. Matt, he must've lost his. Me, oh yeah, I am 133%. Nathan, 78. Nick, 96. Great job, guys. Seems like all my friends are on track. I also really love the notifications on this because sometimes I'll have my phone in my pocket or in my purse. So I don't always need to get my phone out. I can take a quick glance. I feel like I'm selling you guys on the Apple watch, but, really, this is what everybody does, so this is all not new information. I'm just telling you how I use it, which, I'm sure a lot of you guys use it very, very similar, and if you don't, please, tell me. What do you guys use your Apple watch for? I love being able to just glance very quickly, see if it's something that I should get my phone out, especially if I'm on set and I'm not really supposed to have my phone, or if you're anywhere, working a job where they make you put your phone away, this basically doubles as a phone. So recently I've been doing a lot more fitness activities, and I've been hiking a lot, and now that it's the summer, the weather has been fantastic, but during the summer, I do feel so much more motivated to go outside and do things. So in the past couple of months, I have been hiking, and I like to keep my phone in my pocket, so if I don't have access to it, I can control my music or my podcast or my audiobooks right from my watch. This is the last audiobook that I listened to, so you guys know what is about to come up, but let me just tell you. If you have never got an audible book off of my promo code before, this is the time to do it now. Even if you already have, I definitely recommend this book, especially if you're a creative person. You can go to audible.com/iJustine or text iJustine to 500500 to get a 30 day free trial and also a free book. This book is called Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear. Now I feel like this is one of those books that I was desperately needing to listen to. This whole past year has been a little bit of a struggle, creatively and personally and just so many different things, and I found out about this book because Elizabeth Gilbert, the author of this book who also wrote Eat, Pray, Love, which is crazy. I've never read, I've never seen the movie, and I didn't even know anything about it. But Elizabeth came and spoke to us in New York when we were at the creator summit, and she had so many wise and inspirational things to say. So I just recently finished this book while I was on a hike, and I love listening to audiobooks, especially now that it's in the summer, just going out, hiking, being alone, and listening to a book, especially this one. Elizabeth reads it. It's only a five hour listen, so it is fairly quick. So Elizabeth says in the book, this is by far one of my most favorite quotes, I'm kind of summarizing it. \"The older that I get, the less impressed I am \"with originality and more impressed with authenticity.\" I feel like this quote is so powerful, especially to a lot of people here on YouTube. We lose ourselves in that vicious cycle of just making more videos and not being ourselves. So hearing that quote and having that just, sort of, reiterate everything that I've been doing the past couple of years was so powerful and so meaningful, and I just really hope that if you guys do get this book, it also has an impact on you as it has on me. So Elizabeth, if you're watching this, which you probably aren't, I just wanna say, I love you. You're incredible, and thank you so much for inspiring me and inspiring so many other people. Next on my listening list is Eat, Pray, Love. Again, if you wanna get a free book and a 30 day free trial, go to audible.com/iJustine or text iJustine to 500500. So now I'm gonna go through the rest of these apps that I have on here, and this is something that I just recently learned, I didn't even realize that you could do this. I feel so silly because this is something that I feel like I should know. I'm iJustine and I didn't know this? I know. I'm shook. Here's all my apps. If you do a hard press, it'll change to list view. So here in list view, you can go through all of your apps. So going through these, we have Activity, Airbnb, Alarms, American Airlines, the Apple Store, British Airlines Flights, Breathe, Calendar, Camera, Fandango, Find Friends, Fly Delta, GoPro, Headspace, Health Mate, Heart Rate, Home, Hue, JetBlue, Lufthansa, I always mispronounce that airline. Mail, Maps. So one of the things that I do like about Apple Maps is if you are driving, it'll kind of give you that little extra notification of, hey, you're gonna be turning now, make sure you do that. Messages, Facebook Messenger, Music, MyFitnessPal, which I haven't used in quite a while. News, Phone, Photos, Radio, Realtor.com, which I don't even remember ever downloading that. Reminders, Remote, Settings, Starbucks, Stocks, Stopwatch, Swarm, Timer, Tweetbot, Uber, United, Wallet, Weather, Workout. I'm extremely excited, if I haven't mentioned it already, for it to be able to track yoga and hikes. Ugh, I can't wait! World Clock, Yelp, and Zillow. So those are all the apps that I have on here. There's only been a few moments where I actually forgot my Apple watch at home, and it's always just, I just feel like something's missing. I get so used to doing this. Being able to just look at my notifications and know everything that's going on with my day, and it's also very strange because I start getting phantom taps on my wrist when I don't have it, and I wear this thing so tight, I've got a permanent indentation and a tan line. I really need to maybe switch up my wrists a little bit, so that I can get this tan line evened out. I've been looking at a bunch of mock-up designs that people are saying that this could be the next Apple watch. I definitely think that they are probably gonna make it a little bit thinner because this is kind of, I mean it is a little bit thick. It really hasn't changed in size for quite a while. Thankfully, this year, I realized that I should not be wearing a 42 millimeter watch. It always felt a little bit big, but I thought that I wanted a bigger screen, and when I switched to the 38, it was honestly shocking what a difference it made. I really love my Apple watch, and I honestly just feel like it is such an extension of me now. I'm very excited about the future of Apple watch, and I can't wait until they announce something new because I am just patiently waiting. I'm also still patiently waiting for AirPower. I just wanna be able to charge all of my devices at the same time on one beautiful little mat. I need this. I need this in my life. Let me know if there's any other video you guys would like to see me make here. I have been taking a lot of your suggestions, and you guys have so many incredible ideas, and I love being able to make those videos come to life for you. And again, if you guys do decide to get the book, Big Magic, by Elizabeth Gilbert, please let me know what you think about it after you read it or listen, have her read it to you. I've been packing and getting ready for VidCon, which is happening right now. I should be packing, but I'm shooting a video, and now I'm gonna go edit this, and then I'm gonna pack. So I will see you guys there, and I think this is probably a good time to maybe start Eat, Pray, Love. Elizabeth, you're the best. You guys are the best. I will see you in my next video. Bye. Oh, Apple watch is the best. (calm music)",

    "transcript": "- Everyone's talking about Apple stuff these days, but what about their ugly cousin Beats? This is the actual retail packaging. Just joking, it's gonna be good. We've got three different colors. Oh, this one's gonna be the stone purple. I've seen stones like that. This one is a sage gray. Sage gray makes it seem like this is a green type of gray, but I would argue that this is a gray type of green. What the hell is this, another green one? - [Jono] Oh, really? - I can't abide. This dude cannot abide. Oh, wait a second. Oh, they just didn't wanna give me a boring black box. Here's the real retail packaging. There they are. Well, first of all, purple's my favorite color. I own it now. And I'm starting to dig getting tech products and other things that are just not black anymore. I used to do black for everything. All black all the time but now it's just kind of boring. And as Jono from Horace said minutes ago, I think aluminum is our generation's beige. - [David] Yup! - And it's like, yeah. Now these side by side, if I was on the store shelf, it almost just looks like a difference in printing quality of the ink, very subtle though. We'll open them up and check it out. What does this little paper say? It's pretty damn satisfying when you find the perfect fit. Whether your jeans or your person, the search can be exhausting. The search for your perfect fitting person. Is that what that saying? - [David] Yeah. - Okay. - [David] Search for love. - Let's check it out. Oh, that is so glued. Look at that. Oh, look at it straight across the whole thing. That can't be right. No, no, no, it's not right. Look at these little arrows. They're screaming at you. Don't be dumb. It's just that easy. All right, which one's which guys shell game? Place your bets, David. Purple where? - [David] Uuh, middle. Dang it! - Jono, purple where? - [Jono] To your right. (soft screaming) - [David] That's not fair! - Beat by Jono. Okay, this gray and black are obviously different. First impression from here, they kind of don't look expensive. They're $200 but, I don't know, something about the look of this plastic especially the gray one. It doesn't look great. I wouldn't get the gray one. The inside is cool it's got that more green on the inside. Playful. Boring black with the red. Yeah, gray? No. It's in like, it's the worst of all worlds. It's not like subtle like the black and it's not outrageous like the purple. So yeah, I would pass on that personally. This lid kind of rattly. Look at you can see it bounce on the open. It's like bodongdong. Like, it goes back and forth a bit. Not a small case, but I think it's smaller than the Powerbeats Pro case. It has USBC charging and it looks like it's the type where you pair it by hitting the button on the inside of the case, which I prefer. It's a lot easier than holding out a button on the ear bud and not knowing what's going on. And if you have an iPhone, it's supposed to have that magic pairing process which you can get in Android if you configure it in the app. And I do have the companion app. We'll check that out in a bit. But let's do the unboxing. Inside is just a little USBC. The C cable. The very little. It's a wee C to C. Great sound starts with proper fit. Different ear tips. I guess the medium ones are on there. They've got small and large. And then there's some literature. I guess they're advertising for Apple Music. Got your structions. You got a sticker. Cool. Wait a second. What box did that stuff come out of, the gray one? Do you get different ear tips for the different colors? Yes! Purple ear tips in the purple box. These were for the gray box and stands to reason black. You think if you mix and match that's cooler if I put a black one on there? - [David] I mean they are in your ear. - Yeah, they should be completely occluded by your ear but I don't know. Well we won't see I'm not gonna bother trying it. You're not gonna buy two or like share or something. It's unlikely. Let's see how they click back into the case. Oops. Not bad. Not bad. Will I ever get confused? Probably not. It's pretty obvious that because they have this big wing tip that that's gonna go up into the area where there's space for it so I think it'd be pretty clear which one goes where. The earbud itself it is a pretty clean look. They've got this flexible wing tip here which they're saying that they surveyed all these different ears and it's supposed to fit with everybody. There's a button on here. It has a nice feeling. It's tactile, but it's not clicky. You can hear it when it's in your ear. (ear pods clicking) Can you hear that? - [David] Yup. - Cool. But it's imperceptible from even here. You could sit by someone on an airplane and not even hear that. It's got the detectors for skin so it should pause when you take it out. I think the bill quality of the earbud is better than the case. All right, I'm gonna pair these to my app now, right after this message from our sponsor, Honey.

Need location access. Only this one time. Beats Fit Pro detected. I guess I kinda click that. Oh, what is going on? - [Jono] Is it because you have all three open? - Oh my God. (all laughing) Now I've got to hold the button down. - [Jono] Is the light blinking? - Yeah, there's a light on the front of this blinking now. Can you see this? Here we go. There we go. Now it's telling me how to do it. For our comfortable and secure fit, rotate the wing tip into the upper part of your ear. But I already knew that because I've worn headphones. How does it look? - [Jono] It looks actually pretty good. - Oh, there's like some kind of transparency mode on right now. You got kind of amplify it. - [Jono] Nice. - Twist the bud. Okay I got that. Whoa, cool. It's like it knows that they're purple and it's given me like a purple UI. That's pretty. That's a nice touch. - [Jono] It does protrude out of your ears though. - These protrude a bit? - [Jono] Yeah. - They look a little dumb straight on? - [Jono] Yeah. - [David] I wouldn't say it looks dumb, but it looks like they could fall out at any second. - They look insecure? - [David] Yeah. - Well, we're gonna test that in a bit because they say that these are gonna be secure enough because of this wing tip for the most vigorous workouts, burpees, other stuff. ANC off. Can you speak to me again? - [Jono] Intimate encounters. - Intimate encounters. Transparency. Oh, now transparency is on. Before it was just ANC. That sounds kind of wacky. - [Jono] I saw Dune again last night. - I've seen Dune twice also. - [Jono] Yeah, it's great. - Nice work And now noise canceling is on. Okay, cool. I'm gonna just turn it off. You can rename your Beats. That's good. Beats Fit Pro. Beats Fit, bro. How about that? Oh, a generated a name? Mars. Poupon. I'm keeping these as Poupon. This is a pretty nice app. Product features, automatic ear detection is on so it'll pause. Adjust the controls as you prefer. So right now press and hold is doing what? Press and hold on both left and right Beats to adjust volume up and down. What the heck? I've never seen that interaction on earphones before. Press and hold on both to adjust volume up and down. What does that mean? You press and hold them both and then what? This isn't gonna tell me anything. Okay, I think what this means is press and hold on either the left or right. Like I think it means on the left, you hold that and it goes volume down. Yeah, look at it. There's my phone adjusting. On the right, you hold that and it's volume up. It actually does not mean press and hold on both. That's, oh look at the volume! (presenter giggling) That's amazing. That, okay it's a gesture I've never seen before and it still doesn't exist. Microphone. The active Beats Fits Pro microphone can automatically change from left to right. That's sick. So it's saying that the mic, the mic is using during a call could either be on this bud or on this bud, because there's lots of mics on each bud because the mics are used for active noise canceling. But I suppose it's saying that there is a preferred microphone to use in any given situation depending on the noise around you so it'll actually switch during our call which mic it's using. I don't know how it's determining which earphone mic it should use but I would leave it on automatic. Try it at least. Noise canceling with one ear bud. Allow earbuds to be put in noise cancellation mode when only one is in your ear. That is an interesting option. I'm not inclined to put that on, but it's interesting that they give you the choice. I think that's cool. I'm gonna just play some music. Dune soundtracks, subscribe to They're Just Movies. That was like a two hour podcast. Okay, so I'm not even gonna assess the sound right now I just wanna know one press for pause, double tap for next, triple tap restarts, and long press is gonna giving me volume. Now I'm gonna go back to the app and see if I turn off the volume control if I get transparency mode through that. Oh, Poupon, welcome back. Bienvenido. Okay, press and hold. Let's try turning off volume control. Now what happens when I hold? I heard badang and now I'm in transparency mode. Now, if I go again, now I'm in nothing mode. Now I'm in. I'm trying to figure out if holding one or the other matters. What is this? What is this? Hello? I don't feel like I'm transitioning or cycling between three different modes. I feel like I'm going between like ANC on and transparency. Also, I don't know about the comfort of these man. Not loving it. I feel like it's kind of hurting my upper ear, the conch part where that thing fits in. Actually I wanna see if they really do fit in really well. They're pretty secure. Can I do burpees though? They're in there. They're IPX4 rated which they thought was cool enough to put on their marketing but honestly that's like pretty bog standard, especially for $200. Let's play some songs that I'm familiar with. Bass is pretty low. Oh I love this snare sound in this song is such a good snare sound. Yeah, they have their beats signature tuning, which is pretty much V-shaped. I think that they also say in their marketing that it's like a, it's a balanced listening experience but I think that the bass is a bit overcooked but most people are gonna like that honestly. The metal test. If there's ever like double kicks and all you hear is like, (presenter blubbering) because the bass isn't fast enough to differentiate the two strikes. The test I like to do with metal though is I turn it up loud and I see how harsh the guitar sound. These are plenty loud enough I don't wanna go higher than this even. It doesn't sound great loud not because of the harshness, but just because of like, it's just really, everything's kind of blurred together I'm getting less differentiation between the instruments. Now, if I'm onto hip hop then these are way better suited for that. \"California Love\" sounds great. Yeah, I think that the performance of them is commensurate with other products in this category. $200 is pretty much the sound you get. I think everybody knows this point what the signature Beat sound is and that's what you're getting here. No surprises. Now let's talk about the competitive landscape. These are 200 bucks. The Powerbeats Pro which this product is supposed to be positioned between the Powerbeats Pro which is $250 MSRP and the, where are they? I got the little ones here. The earlier studio beats. These guys Beats Studio Buds, which were 150. Slightly smaller case. These are obviously not as targeted toward fitness people. Although I will say that this doesn't feel like it's as in my ear either. Does that look like it chats out of my ear? - [David] No. - [Jono] No. That actually looks good. - You like that one more? - [Jono] Yeah. - You can get Powerbeats Pro for 200 bucks right now. People like those earphones a lot. So they're the same price as these new ones so I don't know how to what extent these are gonna to like be, you know, filling out there. They align with like options at every price point. Now I haven't used the Powerbeats Pro myself. I know that Riley and Lance would really be like them. So I don't know if the extra 50 bucks gets you better sound quality or better battery life or what. Or if it's just like time has passed and you might as well just buy these because they're like new and improved. - [Jono] What about the AirPods Pro? - The AirPods Pro are 250 bucks also, right? Yeah. - [David] It's in a chip. - Yeah, this also does have the H1 chip in it that gives you all like the Apple Magic. $30 more than the new AirPods Gen three which don't have ANC. Oh, these also have spatial audio because they have that H1 chip. Spacial audio I think is dumb. First thing I would never use it. If you don't know what it is, it basically instead of surround sound, it makes it so like your source device is a fixed location. So like when we watch TV and we don't have earphones in, when we turn our heads, that sound of the TV is over there and then when I turn my head this way I can hear it differently. That's what it does. I don't really know why you want that. I've tried it it's like okay. It's not on all content and I think it might be iOS only. It's definitely iOS only. So not a selling feature for me. Would I get these above AirPods for $30 cheaper? If I want ANC, yeah. Would I get them instead of AirPods Pro and save 50 bucks? I don't know. You'd have to wait for a review for that personally, but I probably would lean towards spending the 50 bucks. Battery life on these things. If you have ANC or transparency mode on you get six hours per listen and then an additional 21 out of the charge case. So three more charges for a total of 27. If you don't have ANC on you get seven hours plus an additional like 30. So you got 37 in total. And in five minutes of USBC fast charging you get an hour of playback. One thing I will say is that other earphones in this price here do give you more options in terms of EQs. Some of them have apps where you can just adjust the frequency response as you want. And I prefer that over an earphone that has a signature sound that tells you what you want. I mean, I think you can get apps for that but I'd like to have it out of the box. Yeah. Look at that. Isn't that cute? I think it actually would look better like this though maybe. Whatever. Thanks for watching short circuit guys.

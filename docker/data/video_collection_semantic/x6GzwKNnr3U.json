    "transcript": "hello good people Eber here with Hardware Canucks CES is continuing and we stopped at the HyperX suite to see some impressive gaming headsets in their new cloud orbit series there are supposed to bring gaming audio to the next level but speaking of next-level stuff razor thermaltake Phanteks MSI and Corsair all gums up for sponsoring this CES trip without them we would not have been able to bring you all this content now while HyperX has been mainly focused on delivering affordable headsets that provide awesome value along with good performance the cloud orbit series is very different these are premium products that incorporate advanced audio features to deliver a more immersive gaming experience at least that's what HyperX claims we're all used to HyperX handsets going for between 75 to about $150 but the basic cloud orbit will be going for around 300 dollars while the more advanced orbit s costs 330 dollars so a $30 premium you heard that right these are two of the most expensive gaming headsets on the market right now but why does HyperX even think that they can charge this much when even premium gaming headsets from sennheiser go for much less let's look at the orbit to put things into perspective it's based on the high end audism mobius which is widely regarded as one of the best sounding headsets around it uses 100 millimeter plain our magnetic drivers and clothes backs to deliver an incredibly realistic soundstage with a frequency response of 10 Hertz to fifty thousand Hertz in our short time listening to them I can honestly say that there are the moong the best especially when it comes to three-dimensional audio but I'm still not sure about the price point the microphone being used here is pretty impressive too it is an electric condenser mic with noise cancelling capabilities which can be completely detached in case you only want to use the headset for listening to music luckily the design doesn't scream gamer either since the orbit series is wired HyperX has made sure that they have all the necessary detachable cables too so there's a 1.2 meter 3.5 million cord and since they use a standard USB type-c connection both USB C 2 type A and C 2 C cables are included which is nice but what makes the orbit s $30 more expensive well it incorporates something called waves NX technology that supposed to track your head movements to deliver better positional audio that sounds better than reality though but you know from our experience it was certainly interesting so for example I got to try out the Senate channel mode or Center 3d mode that basically you know emulates a center channel speaker in front of you and then as you move your head towards the left and right that position speaker at the center would stay exactly where it is so you get a nice dynamic shift between you know moving your head around which is actually quite an interesting experience it doesn't replicate virtual 7.1 surround sound but it takes positional awareness to a whole new level I certainly have to spend some more time with his headset so definitely stay tuned for my full review it's more than obvious that Odysseys partnership with HyperX will get their technology into more people's hands but the orbit's price point is just way too high we'll have to see what happens I mean I might end up comparing it to the actual Mobius so who knows definitely stay tuned for that another thing that HyperX showed was their new Quadcast standalone mic for streamers on PC Xbox ps4 and Mac it seems like everyone is releasing their mics lately and it will be tough for this one to distinguish itself although I like a few features I'll get to in a moment the Quandcast does have anti vibration shock mount and it also comes with an adapter so if you were to buy a third party arm that extends towards your that's a little bit more flexible you can just adapt this you can use this adapter and mount it easily which is pretty awesome it also comes with gain control and a tap to mute function which is pretty awesome and it actually lights up in whren as soon as you hit the untap button because it gives you a I guess a realistic scenario as to whether or not you're actually recording anything or what people are hearing you so that's pretty nice and of course there are four selectable polar patterns I'm gonna chime in Dimitri to test out the microphone quality so you guys can get a good idea of how this thing sounds so let's go in here alright guys so now let's actually hear what the HyperX Quadcast sounds like we have on the bio directional pattern recording so it's recording everything from the front and the back isolating things on the sides and yeah let me press record so what you're hearing now is that recorded by the HyperX Quadcast I'm in the very low sensitivity so let me yeah boost that up a little bit and so the gain on a microphone is very helpful so you can come a bit closer if you like to speak a bit quieter and go the whole thing or you can move back a bit to have a little bit distance between microphone so it's picks up your volume now it has noise cancellation applied directly into the microphone it is driverless so it's plug-and-play but the noise cancellation it's not too aggressive but it's definitely audible and so yeah let me know what you would you think what sounds like I think it sounds great has great condenser quality to the microphone yeah the HyperX Quadcast lastly there's a price so the Quadcast microphone will go for around one hundred and forty dollars so there you guys have it a couple of interesting things from HyperX what do you guys think about both the orbit the orbit s and of course the Quadcast standalone microphone from HyperX I'd love to know your thoughts in the comments down below stay tuned for more coverage from CES 2019 I'm Eber with HardwareCanucks thank you so much watching and I'll see you in the next one",

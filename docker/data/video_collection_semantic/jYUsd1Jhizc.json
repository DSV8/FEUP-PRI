    "description": "The EARIN M-2 earbuds are as close as Ive gotten to the fabled Apple Airpod experience on Android. No, I'm not talking about the obvious knockoffs you can find for $50 that give you all of the awkward Airpod looks and none of the convenience; I'm talking about an alternative approach to earbuds that makes sense, sounds great, and almost totally disappears into the ear. Of course, you pay a pretty penny for a package like that -- but seeing as how the EARIN M-2s have held their price for over half a year now, it seems Im not the only one who feels they're worth it. Join me for the MrMobile EARIN M-2 Review!   [SUBSCRIBE TO MRMOBILE]     [ABOUT MRMOBILE'S EARIN M-2 REVIEW]  MrMobile's EARIN M-2 Review was produced following four months with an EARIN M-2 review unit provided by EARIN. The units were tested with several Android phones running version 8.1 or later, including the BlackBerry KEY2.

    "transcript": "- [Michael Fisher] Fun fact. I've never used Apple AirPods. I just don't use an iPhone often enough, but I've heard enough about them to want them. By all accounts AirPods are the simplest, most reliable Bluetooth earbuds on the market. And the Android world doesn't seem to have a solid alternative from one of the big names. Google's Pixel Buds were panned, while the Samsung and Sony sets I've tested have really just been okay, at best. So when Earin let me try it's M-2 ear buds back at IFA 2018 in Berlin, I was still on the search for an AirPods analoger. And you know what, I think these are it. (upbeat music) The wins here start with the carrying case. This aluminum capsule that everyone keeps asking me if I vape with. But instead of sticky smoke juice, the capsule holds the twin earbuds and the 600 milliamp power battery. So that every time you pop 'em back in the case, they're charging. The buds seat magnetically in the cradles and the slide closes with magnets, too. Clicking home with a sound so satisfying you'll fiddle with it all day long. (case clicking) It all feels very well made. The only complaint I have is that the charging port is Micro-USB (people moaning) which was old-school even last year. The buds themselves are tiny, almost too tiny. See, the entire outboard side of each bud has a capacitive glass plate that you can tap to play, pause or call up Google Assistant or Siri. So you're basically guaranteed to accidentally tap them when donning or ditching. That means you need to carry the capsule with you at all times. Just pulling out the buds and shoving them in your pocket is a guarantee of accidental taps. They're also so small you'll end up dropping them if you don't use the capsule. Which I've done at least three times. (buds clattering) Fortunately, they seem durable since they haven't broken, yet. (uplifting music) When they're in your ears, the M-2s are as comfortable as any earbuds can be. With tips who's Comply Foam material is heat activated to conform to your ear canal. The neat thing about these, the buds are identical, so you won't find any left or right labels and each is capable of serving as the master connection to the phone. And if you need to put 'em down for a sec, they sit on a tabletop like adorable little alien robot friends. It's a good time. I don't get out much. Once I had 'em set up, I was impressed by how smart the M-2s were. You pop 'em out of the case and by the time you've got the second one in your ear they're already connected to your phone. The sound stage is much more nuanced than it has any right to be given their size. (electronic static) There's a spaciousness that I didn't expect and noise reduction is pretty good, too, for earbuds I mean. The only thing I can say against the sound is that these are a little flatter on more dynamic tracks. Also occasionally, one earbud didn't immediately connect to the other, so I had an imbalance for a few seconds, but that was rare. Most of the time, the things just worked. (uplifting music) The Earin App is also good. It lets you tune the music and how much outside sound you let in. I generally leave it at automatic so when I pause the music, the acoustics of the outside world come in to replace it. That way I don't need to take the buds out to talk to someone. And battery life is very close to the advertised figures. A few months in I'm getting three hours, 45 minutes per charge of the buds. The capsule carries an additional 10 hours. (uplifting music) Let's touch on drawbacks before we hit the price. I haven't enjoyed using the M-2s for phone calls. Callers said I sounded far away and muddy. They're also splash resistant, but not water-proof and, dang it, the logo shouldn't rub off this easily. (uplifting music) Nitpicking, not really. At $249, the Earin M-2s are about a hundred bucks more than the Sony and Samsung competition I've tested and $70 more than Apple. But they're so much better than any other buds I've reviewed, that I can't help but endorse them. These are as close as I've gotten to the fabled AirPod experience on Android, so far. And given that they've held their price for over half a year now, it seems I'm not the only one who feels that way. Buy 'em, if you wanna treat yourself or wait for the M-3s and hope that price comes down. (uplifting music) As always folks, I'm interested in what you're putting in your ears. Hit me in the Comments with your favorite headset or, a little change of pace, your favorite music of the moment and be sure and Subscribe to the MrMobile on YouTube and Instagram so you don't miss the next mobile tech review coming sooner than you might think. Finally, you might notice this review is ah, well about eight months after the product first launched, so if you'd like to Share it, I won't stop ya. Until next time, thanks for watching and stay mobile, my friends. (uplifting music)",

    "transcript": "- We are currently about 13 days since lockdown, and it has been over, probably 20 days, since I have been able to train in jiujitsu, because all of the gyms closed before the lockdown even happened. I've been getting a little stir crazy. I've been doing some solo drills, but it hasn't really been that effective, and other than me trying to get Jenna to fight me. Since Jenna doesn't really wanna participate, I got something. It is in this box. I need your help opening this Jen, but before I do, I'm asking you guys one simple question. What is the craziest and weirdest and strangest thing that you guys have purchased, or need to purchase while in quarantine? What do you think is in this box? - He is not gonna like it. Not gonna like this. You know what this is? - Yeah. - 'Cause you were creepin' in my Amazon. - I was trying to make a return for you, which you, by the way, never followed up on with me. It really does look like something that Dexter would have... - Yeah, it's not that heavy, though. Can we kick it? - I mean, not, well, you can. Actually I think it does have a strike-proof head. - Strike-proof head, people! - Here we go. Here it is! My very own grappling dummy. - Wow. - Matty. No, Matty. Oh yeah, that's nice wrist action here, some joints. - I could punch this. - Yeah, you can, look. It's very heavy. - Like we've done this before. - Put it right here. - Okay. Okay, where's the chainsaw. - Okay, oh, this is gonna be great. - But he's not fighting back. - Yeah, this is great. - That's gonna hurt your hand. - So now that we have this - Ah, where's your toy, where's your toy? - Matty's bored in the house, - And he's in the house bored. - This is weird, I feel uncomfortable. - Doesn't seem great. - Well he doesn't really move very well. - He's not gonna tap either. (bass guitar plays) - Do you wanna wear an outfit? Let's put a Gi on you. I hung up all my Gi's. Usually I just throw them into a corner until next class, but there haven't been any classes. I think it'll fit fine. Eight one F's a little snug on our boy, or girl. Yeah, see this butts gonna. We're gonna have to get you a bigger pair. I think it's like six foot. Definitely gonna need to get you bigger pants. - Do you have a bigger one? - I'm not really... - If anybody wants to figure out a name for my friend here, feel free to leave those in the comments below. - There's gonna be something in the comments below. - Because they can't get up to the shoulder. - We could work on like rear naked choke. - So I think I'm gonna have to order him his own Gi. - I keep saying it's a him, it's really whatever because we don't know. Maybe we'll just have to be practicing a little no Gi for the time being, until I get you one your own size. Shhh, go to sleep, shhh, go to sleep. Go to sleep go to sleep. Hi Matty, do you think that I'm crazy? - Here he does. - Yeah he does. Alright, well, I'm gonna look up some drills now and see what I can do. I just finished editing this video, and I realized that it was only three minutes. So I thought I would just kind of hop back on here and just say hi, see how you guys are doing. I'm sure some of you guys might be really confused because you probably had no idea that I'd been training jiu jitsu for the past two years. - So last month I just wrote a little blog post - just talking about it because it means so much to me, and over the past several years it just helped me get through a lot of really tough times. And now that something that has been I guess my therapy is now not something that I can do or a lot of us can do. And I know for a lot of people that jiu jitsu is their outlet. It's become something that you need to do for yourself. So I've just been trying to find some ways to still stay active. And I'm feeling like such a hypocrite because at the beginning of this whole quarantine thing I told myself, I told you guys the most important thing to do was to workout everyday, stay active. And I've been struggling very hard doing that. And I've been watching other peoples videos of them talking about all of the incredible things that they're doing during quarantine. Creating art, creating music, creating YouTube videos, and I wanted that to be me, and then I just, kind of it really hasn't. And I think what's important is that no matter what you guys are doing right now, I think the key thing just surviving, getting through it, and kind of adapting to this new way of life. Because I don't think that life is ever going to be the same. Like nothing after this will be the way that it was before. And I think coming to terms with that, and accepting it, I'm not there yet. I don't think a lot of us are there yet. So I think just working through that and processing and trying to figure out what the new normal is is I think something that we're all kind of working through together. So I really do wanna hear from you guys, like what are you doing to keep yourself busy? To keep active, to keep yourself as sane as possible? Because to go from one lifestyle to a completely other overnight is very challenging. So whatever you're feeling, it's completely normal. And I've really been trying to just create content that is keeping me entertained that is also keep you guys entertained. Because the one thing that I didn't want to do was to keep creating. I didn't even wanna make any videos when this all started. And it was because of you guys who tweeted me, when I asked what I should do, and what YouTubers should do. You guys had to keep creating, and keep being that sort of normal consistent thing that you enjoyed watching before all of this started. So that's what I've been trying to do. It's been giving me a little bit of normalcy. And I've been spending so much time - playing Animal crossing - I hope that you guys have been enjoying the gameplay. - I've had a lot of fun making them, - and even editing them has been really fun. - It's been such a long time since I did that. And I feel like when I started my gaming channel many many years ago I'm a much faster editor now. So it's taking way less time to edit these videos than it did back in the day. I also have a much faster computer. So that also can help. Another thing, this is (coughs) Every time I cough I think it's the end. Another thing speaking about editing Final Cuts and Logic is free for 90 days. So if you guys have ever wanted to learn Final Cuts. It used to be a 30 day free trial but now Apple is giving 90 day free trials so go check it out, I am such a huge fan of Final Cut. I also have a Final Cut tutorial if you are incredibly bored and wanna try to learn Final Cut and have me teach you. Well that's it, I just wanted kind of end this video and see how you guys are doing and give you an update on what's happening over here cause I feel like a lot of times people think that everything is perfect in peoples lives that they watch online, and it's all curated, the stuff that we post on Instagram. At some point I think we lose a lot of reality in the sense of reality because if we're posting fun stuff all the time you think that person's fine, nothing is wrong, they're great. So just keep in mind that what you're feeling probably everyone's feeling that way no matter what sort of face or front that they're putting on. So that being said, I look forward to being able to train again hopefully sometime soon. But it is really incredibly important that we try to stay healthy and we try and stay away from people as hard as it might be. Just stay inside and may I recommend, if you have a Nintendo Switch, get Animal Crossing. It will fill your days. (upbeat music)",

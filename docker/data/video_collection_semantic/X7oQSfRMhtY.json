    "transcript": "Hello welcome come to This Is. This is the Xbox series X, and I suppose X-Box Series S controller. So we've had a chance to play with this back in February when we got our early hands on, but now we actually have the control here in the studio. So we take a little deep dive into what makes a series X controller, not the exact same thing is every other X-Box control ever. - I give this 10 out of 10. - Hold on, you can't start the video by just tossing 10 over 10. DO you think we're IGN over here. - Yeah, yeah. - Thank you very much for watching. Make sure to subscribe to This Is for other very short videos like this. If you look at the two of these side by side, so on my right, we have, uh, the Xbox one controller. This is the older model without the headphone Jack and without Bluetooth, but essentially the same sort of design compared to the series X. They look very, very similar. But they are quite a few differences. - And they're all very subtle. - It's evolution, - not revolution, - The control is actually slightly differently shaped. - So it actually kind of tucks in. So if you look at like where my fingers are right here, like I'm actually in a little bit more, whereas when I pick this one up, my controllers at my hands actually kinda like a bit out. So the reason they gave for doing this is they're essentially, it's still comfortable for people with larger hands, but if you have a slightly smaller hand, this series X controller is going to be marginally better, not a big difference, but it is a little bit sort of tighter on the top. - The other thing too is you had on the, uh, the one controller, very smooth plastic, which I was never that big of a fan of. - It gets really like sweaty and kind of gross as you're gaming for hours and hours on end. If you're into fortnight or, or for guys, it's not an Xbox yet, is it? - No. - What's a game that the kids play on Xbox. - One of the things, things that I really appreciate about the, um, the series X controller is that it's textured in this, in this little area. It's very subtle. I don't even know if the camera's going to pick it up, but like you can,(plastic rubbing). - Oh, that's not a good noise. - It's not a good noise (plastic rubs) - But that's also not a good noise. - Yeah, like it's still plastic, but it's... - Can we tie SMR, Xbox series, X controller test or something? - This is the texture that you want. - Okay, Okay. - I'm testing the real things about the controller. - All the things that are updated on the series X, do we call it just the Xbox series controller? So the thing is something to keep in mind with all of these controllers, they're all entered compatible with each other. So for example, this original launch Xbox One controller will work on something like a series or series X. And likewise, you can buy a Series X controller and still play it on your original Xbox One or One X. And of course they all work with PC as well, which is really nice. - It's really nice. Again, like maybe people don't like the grip that we just said we liked, and... - Or you have a bunch of old X-Box 1 controllers. - Right. You don't have to buy new ones. - Upfront there are a few differences. So the D Pad is now this little sort of dish shaped. So in fact, I've actually, I bring in the, uh, the elite controller. You'll see that it's very similar to this. Actually kinda of like this more. In fact, if someone in my life were to have theoretically at force touch this controller, the first thing that she may have said was, Oh, wow, this feels much better. Hypothetically, of course, that's not a real story. I'm just hypothetically speaking. - Hypothetically, hypothetically, someone signing an embargo deal. - Let's close it to each controllers. So beyond that upfront, you'll also notice that there's now a share button. So this isn't exactly revolutionary or dramatic. You can assume what that might be able to do. Um, - You're cool. You know, you clip your cool ed shot, whatever bam. - [Ken] Share to mixer - Hmm rest in peace. - Where's the keyboard? I need. [inaudible] on the bottom. It is basically identical. So we have the same port for a keyboard for a headset or whatever. You also have your headphone Jack. Now this is actually an area of the controller that was not changed in specifically to keep compatibility. So even though the top of the controller is slightly different, this from here, as far as I know is completely the same, which means that yet any of your holdings is likely to work. - And that was really X-Box's whole mantra this entire generation was that the Series X and all of his accessories just work with everything that you already own. - Yeah. which is new for this generation. Right? - Right. And that's really refreshing it's, I like that. - Now. I mean, look, there's also a whole conversation here about what places has done with the dual sense controller, on what's called the Dual Shock. where that obviously is a very new controller. And there are certainly advantages to that. Because if you go for a clean sheet of paper design, you can incorporate things like, you know, like the triggers, you can push the envelope farther, but on the flip side, you do lose the ability to have that backwards compatibility in such as clean way. I can go both ways, but I've always liked the Xbox one controller. Regardless, if you like an Xbox controller, you will find that this is a very similar thing. Now, like you were saying earlier, they have that new texture on the back and they also have the texture on the actual triggers, which is nice. Especially like on this bottom side, it's kinda hard to see on the bumpers, but very nice (pad clicking) clicking, tactile feel. Yeah. But it actually has like the bumps on the side. So let's do a little sound test. So I'm going to push my triggers to my buttons. So this is the series controller (buttons flipping) - (buttons flipping) - Sounds better. - Yeah, Yeah. - It's definitely a little bit more like this sounds hollow, I suppose. - Yes. Like especially the, the buttons. - Yeah. Now beyond that, if you look around the backside of the controller, what you'll see is, um, well our good old thinned AA, - look I get why people like it, you know, you can just throw in new ones when the controller is dead or you could just get a, you know, rechargeable pack. But the weight, like the way that the elite series has done it is just like, this is so good. And like it, the battery lasts a super long time. Yeah. I think I've charges like three times in the year that I've had it. - Yeah. - Like it's crazy. My main issue with any of the battery kit is like one, i think they're ugly. So when... - The ones with like little, like hole in the back where you could like drop on a dock and whatnot. - Yeah. Those are pretty big contacts, which is just not like, when you look at like the Series X one, it's super minimal. Like they have the little dock for it, which is, it's nice Stand. this. Like, I like this. - Yeah. - However, one of X boxes, like really cool features is all the color ways you can do with it. Like the creator lab is so cool. Then if you have one of the battery packs, those never match. - These are most of the changes on the exterior of the Series X. So new, slightly updated design, you have the much better D Pad. You have the new texture. You have the USBC, I guess we didn't mention that it does have USBC now instead of micro USB. Excellent. It is compatible with PC Xbox one Series. I mean everything. - That's one thing that's just like, it's nice that they all have Bluetooth now instead of, like granted I think all of them before had like... - So the launch Xbox One controllers to this one, You can see the difference because it's actually the separate piece of plastic here. This was a non Bluetooth controller cause it had this. And you also can tell because it doesn't have the headphones jack - Yes. Now we're dealing with the Microsoft, uh, wireless, wireless radio radio is great. Especially when they're trying to push game pass next cloud. So now your one controller is compatible with literally any device that you try and play X cloud on. - Very good point. So you can pair this with your phone, with your iPad or whatever the case is. Now there is another feature which you can't see, and it's not really easy to test, but there's actual like improvements to the latency. So this is something that they were talking to us about a few months ago when they had first sort of showed off the controller. Now it's kind of complicated, but essentially the controller is able to timestamp. I got to be very careful how I say this. The controller is able to timestamp the time that you press a button and that will be synced into your, either your console or when you're playing on X cloud, which this is all theoretical. I don't know how much of this is actually going to be available at launch, but essentially the controller can say, Hey, at, you know, second, exactly this, you press the A button. It will then send that to the Xbox and the Xbox would go, okay. I know exactly how long ago that controller was or that control was sent to be able to tighten up the latency, not only on the game. So you should have theoretically, slightly improved latency on local, but specifically with something like X cloud, it will know exactly the end to end latency between when you press that button on the controller. When it goes all the way to the data center process that sends you the frame back. We shall see how actually big of a difference that makes. But we know that this is a feature in these controllers to help improve the latency from end to end when you press the button and you actually get that frame displayed on your TV. Regardless, there are a lot of improvements for the Xbox series controller, but on the whole of it, it is similar. If you like an Xbox one, or even if you like the Xbox 360 controller, this is a very natural evolution. Still works with PC, Still has the same great sticks and the face buttons, the D pad is much better, but really this is not something which is going to blow your mind. And the nice thing is I, if I have a series X or a series S I will feel 100% confident, still keeping my old X-Box one controllers around. It's not like, you know, this is your little brother controller and this man,[inaudible] - You know, - The wired one - With terrible, - But my friends, there's a little look at what you can expect out of the X-Box series controller when it goes on sale very shortly. Can we give it a rating or review? Nope, not yet, but, um, I think our thoughts are pretty self evident. So thank you very much for watching. Make sure to subscribe to this is for lots more wonderful content like this. I said wonderful with a straight face, because it's obviously less than wonderful, but thanks for watching. We'll see you next time. If you judge us to be worthy of your wonderful view - Really selling the channel right now, I never do. I know.",

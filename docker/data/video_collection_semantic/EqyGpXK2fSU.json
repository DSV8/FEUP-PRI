    "transcript": "- Series X, six nanometer! Yes! We found it. Well, well, well, what do we have here, other than a brand-new, asterisk, Xbox Series X? So, it has been four long years, my friends, since Microsoft graced the world with the beautiful Xbox Series X. And today, I believe this is the first time you've really seen a proper redesign with the brand-new Digital Edition. So thank you very much to Microsoft for sending us an early review unit of the Series X Digital. So, there's a little bit of a refresh across the board when it comes to the Xbox lineup. So at the very top, there is the Xbox Series X two terabyte. Honestly, it's actually kind of nice to have that kind of extra storage, but this one's expensive. This is going to come in at $600. The thing I think a lot of people are gonna be more excited about, though, is the all-digital Series X. At 450 bucks, it is essentially the same price as the PS5 Slim Digital Edition, right? Why are there two Xboxes? Did they send the Special Edition? Aw. - [Alex] Fancy. - So we have our Robot White Xbox Series X controller with... (controller clattering) slot for AA batteries because it's 2024 and people love AA batteries. Behold, my friends, the all-digital Xbox Series X. Oh, it's so much lighter. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Now my assumption is, is that when we crack this thing open, we're gonna find there's just an empty slot because that's what they did with the Xbox One S all-digital. We're four years into the Xbox Series X, and my first impression the very first time I got to crack one open and look at it all the way back in 2020 was, \"Good Lord, this is an expensive-looking console.\" So obviously, no disk drive is gonna help, but I'm curious if there's anything inside of this that will actually be cheaper. Next up, let's unbox the Special Edition. Now this is, as far as I know, an actual Special Edition. I don't know that there's like a specifically like super limited supply of them. So, this is the Galaxy Black two-terabyte Xbox Series X. So, one of the big differences here is the controller. So, you see you've got a little speckle design on the D-pad. It also has the sort of black and green colorway, which I think looks really nice. Ooh. You still have that kinda like two-tone grill, so it's kind of black and then green. But from the front, it looks nice. Now, I will say since I first looked at it, you know something got me, I was like, \"Oh, like it looks like something.\" And then someone said it looks a little bit like paint splatters. And as soon as I heard that, I can't unsee it. So, for context, this is an original Xbox Series X. The only thing that's really different between these two, at least on paper, is the fact that this has not only the different colorway, but also has a two-terabyte SSD inside. I have a bunch of questions about the new lineup. So, first of all, how much lighter is this guy? 'cause the Digital Edition feels like incredibly light compared to the big guys. So, to start, this is the original 2020 launch model of the Series X, which comes in at a total of 4.2 kilos. Now, if I swap on our new two-terabyte model, it weighs a whopping... 4.1? I kind of just assumed that these were gonna be mostly the same. That's not a big difference, but that's enough of a difference that maybe there actually are some differences on the inside. I guess we need to take a closer look. But, before we move on too far, let's take a look to see what the Digital Edition weighs because it certainly feels a lot lighter to me. And this one weighs 3.6. Obviously, I'm gonna spend some time using these consoles, but maybe, just maybe, we should take a little peek inside the digital and see what's up. (Austin laughing) Come on. Do you really think that a new console can possibly be released without me wanting to tear it open to see what's new? What is this, Linus Tech Tips or something? (alarm blaring) Oof, let's start out with the Special Edition with the disk drive. We'll just open this a little bit just to kind of see what the internal should look like with the disk. And then we'll take a look at the diskless one and go as far as we need to get the answers that we deserve. And if you deserve answers like I do, then you should subscribe to the Austin Evans channel and ring-a-ling the ding-a-ling button. So if there's anything like the older ones, I should be able to peel up this sticker and this one to get access to the screws. Now, it should go without saying, don't try this at home. If you do, Mr. Microsoft would be real grumpy about your warranty status. Now, I don't think these stickers don't... They don't really go back on very well after, which is probably by design. (Ken laughing) - Are you telling people to commit warranty fraud? - This does feel a little bit bad to do this to the Limited Edition version. Well, we'll put it back together real easy, don't worry. Why that little dude? Oh. Oh, I scratched, that's okay, just a little scratch, it's fine. I put my finger there so I'll bleed instead. Okay, you know what? That's fine. I was being too gentle with it, thank you. Yeah, you scratched the rest of it. And inside, we've got... Oh, my goodness, is that an Xbox Series X? I'll say that this looks essentially the same. You have the same little Easter eggs where you've got your little Master Chief right here on the fan grill. So, for context. This is the inside of the two-terabyte edition. And let's take a look to see what's inside the Digital Edition. I'm looking for a couple things. Obviously, I'm just curious about how they have designed it without the disk drive, which lives right here. But I'm also curious to see if there's anything else that's different on the inside. This is actually the white one, it's gonna be really dumb. It has like a totally different kind of sticker. The other one peeled off no problem. This one's actually crumbling. I think the white sticker's thinner. (Austin laughing) It's just a hole. (Austin and Ken laughing) - It's just a big fat hole. Can you take the disk drive from the not-all-digital and make the all-digital a not-all-digital? - Maybe, or let me take a look for a second, actually. All right, my second Xbox plate, the big difference here is that this is the disk drive and this is a giant gap where the disk drive would be. I don't know that you could just drop a disk drive in. You would certainly have to cut a hole in the front if you're going to actually add enough space. We happen to have already prepared a Series X disk drive, which I think, I mean would clearly just fit in here, right? Yeah. Now, the question would be more so if they still have the connector. I mean, it really does seem like you're just missing this disk drive. I'm not seeing anything else that's obvious. All right, my friends, I'll be right back after I have thoroughly and scientifically dissected this Series X to see if there are any hidden gems inside or whether I'm gonna waste my afternoon looking for literally nothing. So this is the heat sink for the Xbox Series X Digital Edition, which, as far as I could tell, is the same on this galaxy. What you might notice is that we have some big copper heat pipes, which you may also notice is that these are new. So, if you compare it with the heat sink from an original launch Series X, this does not use heat pipes because instead, it uses a vapor chamber. Now, this is technically a better cooling solution, right, but it's more expensive. It looks like this one actually would even bolt up to it, right? It's got all the same sort of screw holes. One could be so bold as to say that this cooling could be...worse. - [Ken] So dramatic. - I found something, I didn't think there was gonna be anything different on the inside. - I'm getting some deja vu, dude. Like, you're gonna do this again, and then all the Xbox boys are gonna get mad at you. - I didn't say it's the worst yet. (Austin grunting) Well, oh, yeah, of course. 'Cause there's four screws holding in from the other side, yeah, okay. Sorry, I got a little excited. All right, so we have found a few interesting things. So this is the daughter board from the original Series X and this is the Digital. So, while they're very similar, you can see that this has both a SATA and power on it for the disk drive. The traces are there, but it's not actually attached. So even if you could retrofit a disk drive onto the digital, you have to solder on new connectors. And I bet the firmware wouldn't work, but much more interestingly, if you look at the actual main motherboard, there are some pretty substantial differences. So for context, this is the motherboard on the existing Series X. A couple things to note. You've got this little shield, which is there to help kind of hold the actual cooler on. And if you look on this side, you'll see that this is where the SSD lives underneath this little metal connector. Well, if you look at the new motherboard, you'll see it's very different. Not only is it a much more pleasant shade of green, but they have redesigned this (tool clanging) motherboard, that was on the floor, it's fine. So you're missing the little bracket that went around it as well as the shield, so that's just not on there, as well as there's no more shield over the SSD. The other thing that I'm a little bit more excited about is that this is actually just a completely different motherboard. Even though it looks similar, almost every single component I'm looking at here has been simplified, shrunk down, changed, moved around. Even though most things are in these sort of similar positions, I think it's safe to say that it's different, right? But the question is: Is it better or worse? I just love doing the little spinning thing. - [Ken] Oh, stop. Stop. - I can't help it. - So in theory- - [Austin] In theory. - The stuff that the all-digital is experiencing right now with the new chip and everything, in theory, new chip, would probably be in the speckly one as well? - From the outside, the Special Edition model does have the same cooler, right? So you can see the heat pipes poking out the side. This looks like changes they made across the board for 2024 and onward. Gonna carefully pick up the motherboard. Oh, that's so different. Oh. It's smaller. So, this is the original vapor chamber from a launch Series X. And this is the much less vapory-looking cooler from the existing 2024 models. Instead of being copper, it looks like it's aluminum or steel? I'm not entirely sure. I guess I can't be 1,000% sure that there is not a vapor chamber here. Let's go ahead and pull out the scale and see what the weight of these coolers are. And this comes in at 1... 804 grams, and then the 2024 cooler comes in at 700 grams. That's a huge part of our weight difference right there. If you tally that, well, some of the smaller things like the newer Xbox Series X doesn't have this little shield on the back. That's it, my strong suspicion is they have swapped out this vapor chamber with a more traditional heat pipe cooler, which to be fair, is exactly what you will find on the PlayStation 5. Let's take a closer look at this chip. Series X, six nanometer! Yes! We found it. So this is, confirmed, a shrunken down version of the original Series X SoC. Basically, what this means is that this new Series X is cheaper to manufacture. I would expect it's probably running at the exact same clock speeds, but it is using slightly less voltage to hit those clock speeds, which in turn means that they were able to save some money not only by having a slightly smaller chip, but what it does enable them to do is to jettison the more expensive vapor chamber in favor of a more traditional heat sink with a bunch of copper heat pipes instead. Now, we gotta confirm that all these changes are also going to be in the Special Edition, but I would be shocked if they're not. And one of the things I wanna mention, 'cause I know that people are gonna ask about it, is that when it came to the PS5, I kind of roasted it when the 1100 came out because what they did was they took the exact same chip from the original launch PS5 one year later, and they cut the heat sink down significantly and they called it a day, right, which is objectively a downgrade. But when the 1200 came around, while they also shrunk the heat sink more, when you go down to a smaller chip, that actually makes sense because a smaller chip is going to be more efficient, is going to need less thermal sort of headroom. I'll be right back with some hopefully promising or concerning news about the next couple years of Xbox. I've tried to spin it and I did the wrong way the next couple of years of your Xbox future. God, this is so good. And so, my friends, we have some numbers, but the TL;DR is that the new Xbox Series X is better. First and foremost, we ran the same series of tests on our digital Xbox Series X, which, of course, has been disassembled. We put it back together and repasted and everything. So in addition to this, we also tested the unmodified Xbox Series X Special Edition. And on top of that, we also ran a normal Xbox Series X from 2020. So, a completely original launch model that has been untouched. So when it comes to thermals, the exhaust in all three of these are essentially identical, 39, 40 degrees Celsius. And same thing goes for noise. Now, we were getting essentially the same readings, which is about 39 decibels in all three, but that's mostly because that's the room tone. Putting my ear up to all three of these consoles, you can't hear them. But the real difference is in power draw. Starting out with the original launch Xbox Series X. In idle, we were getting about 61 watts. So that's just sitting on the dashboard doing nothing. On the Xbox Series X two-terabyte, the Special Edition, we saw a reduction of about 10 watts. This was running at 51 watts, and the digital almost bizarrely was running at 38 watts. It could just be it won the chip lottery and it has a very efficient ship at idle, I don't know. Or maybe the fact that there's no disk drive, or even the fact that we changed the thermal paste, maybe we put more on than they had the factory. I don't fully know. But what I will tell you is that the results between the two, modified and unmodified, are consistent enough, especially when it comes to the thermals and especially the load when it comes to actually gaming. It's close enough that I feel pretty confident in these kind of numbers that these new Series Xs are just straight up better than the old one. That's a pretty substantial difference because you think about it, when you are letting your console sit there and chill out, right? So it's either sitting on the menu, it's downloading updates, you are watching YouTube, or Netflix, or whatever. The power draw is substantially lower on both of the newer consoles. The bigger difference, or at least for gamers at least, is going to be when you're actually playing a game. We ran \"Forza Horizon 5,\" the exact same sort of stress test and the same sort of benchmark for the opening scene with the Porsche driving through the forest, which we saw had the highest power draw. And again, the newer consoles are better. So starting out with, we have the original Series X. That came in about 167 watts on average driving through that section, the digital model came in 156 watts, and the two-terabyte came in at 151. So what you're seeing here is an 11 to 16-watt reduction in power for the same performance. Now, that might not sound crazy, and it's not, but it is roughly in line with the kind of numbers we saw when we got the 1200 model of PS5, which is also a six-nanometer chip. So essentially, what you're getting here is less power draw, which means a slightly lower power bill, but importantly, no real downsides for that lower power draw. Basically, if you're gonna sum this whole video up, it is really like this. The brand new Xbox Series X, so whether it be the Digital, the Special Edition, I'm assuming the future one-terabyte models as well, I can't confirm it, but my assumption is if you see an Xbox Series X with the newer style of box, it very likely is one of these consoles with a six-nanometer processor. All of these new Xbox Series Xs are using the new redesigned cooling solution and the updated six-nanometer chip. And what you're getting here is essentially the exact same experience in every possible way, except that it is a bit more efficient. So, you're gonna be saving a little bit on the power. But as far as I can tell, there is zero downside to the admittedly cost savings that Microsoft have done, which is really interesting. I have a bunch of questions though, namely: Has the Series S seen any kind of technical changes? Because to my knowledge, it's just a change in the colorway. But based on this, it's totally possible that Series S has also seen a similar kind of upgrade. But, if you'd like to learn more, definitely be sure to go check out our This Is video, we go much more in depth on the theory behind Xbox's strategy. And you also should make sure to subscribe to this channel. The PS5 Pro is right around the corner, my friends, and while this has been a really fun look at what Xbox has been cooking up, I have a feeling that the Sony gang have got something even more spicy when it comes to PS5 Pro, and we'll be doing all kind of content on it. So subscribe, ring-a-ling the ding-a-ling button, and I'm going to go enjoy my additional 10 to 13 watts of power usage. - [Ken] It'll be cheaper for me to play \"Forza.\" - You're gonna save, Ken, cents per month in your power bill. - That's cheaper Game Pass in boy math.",

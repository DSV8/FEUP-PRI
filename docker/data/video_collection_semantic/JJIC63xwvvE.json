    "transcript": "so I'm standing outside of HQ Mart I think which is one of the biggest Tech markets in China and today I'm going to buy the cheapest gaming PC I can find [Music] our journey to China started with an awesome tour of deep Cool's huge new Factory which you can see here clad and solar panels after which we did a two hour drive to shenzhen's spectacular shopping district with multiple massive Tech markets in the same area filled with random Tech crap for us to explore and as a techcrap Enthusiast entering HQ Mort was a bit overwhelming to be honest it was like finding the Holy Grail everywhere you look are stalls selling camera gear laptops cell phone accessories bootleg Apple watches which I immediately bought several versions of possibly for a future video 90 for a range of Apple watches it just seemed like such a bargain but none of this is why I was here I was here to buy the cheapest gaming PC Shenzhen has to offer so we headed to the third floor where the site of endless PC gaming crap got me so aroused I had to spend quite a while beating it down so that I could actually ask some one for pricing without getting arrested so we found our first shop with the cheapest PC available that they can build for us in two hours selling for 260 US dollars with some some awesome specs in it but we'll look around and the second store willing to quote us a cheap ass system was suspiciously vague about what we'd get the next shop we found quoted us about the same price but they're not giving us the spec of this system so it's like a mystery system we'd have to order it and find out which is very tempting but it is a little bit more expensive than the one we looked at before with the Celeron in it but after that seller triggered my insatiable desire to be scammed I got distracted again there were people selling graphics cards ranging from this HD 5570 that looks like somebody dug it out of a hundred year old aircon vent for about ten dollars there were piles of cheap mining graphics cards which of course I had to buy one so that I could never get it running so we just bought a mining GPU but they didn't have change for the the 100 RMB so we got some water with it as well you could also get RTX 4060 TI's for the equivalent of about 420 US Dollars the mountains of 1660 supers everywhere were selling for about a hundred and eighty dollars a pop and if you're really balling you can get an RTX 4080 for about a thousand two hundred dollars which is very similar to U.S pricing and apparently if you're a skilled barter these prices are open to negotiation although I may suck at bartering even in my native language that didn't stop me from buying a graphics card that we can use to upgrade our cheapest system later in the video and after our graphics card purchase we headed to launch in a mall where the police seem to store their man catchers and just general brutality utensils and with a revitalized desire to behave appropriately we headed to the second Labyrinth of a tech market across the street called Sega Mart which again was a gigantic writhing mass of about as much Tech as you could imagine in one place interestingly in segimart aside from the even bigger piles of graphics cards everywhere Skies supporting the world's supply of 1660 supers and 3060s I mean 70s there were also a bunch of ant miners which are like dedicated cryptocurrency Miners and these in the Samsung booth selling for about two thousand dollars each you could also buy some cheap solar panels to help power your digital spelunking Sega mod was also home to the illustrious box tape man his work was everywhere but when it comes to PC gaming segimart seemed to be a bit more upmarket than HQ Mart so we've now meandered through the Maze of PC crap over to a different Market called seg emars which seems more legitimate than the other one we've seen like HP and stuff around here and the smaller PC seller actually quoted me a PC that makes sense we have about 4 000 RMV an i5 a GTX 1660 super which sounds pretty good but it's more than double the price we were quoted at the other shop so still leaning towards the Mysteries back and with a couple more little more random boxes filled with motherboards we decided to head back to the wonders of HQ Mart where we spent another couple hours wandering around but couldn't get quoted anything close to the 2000 ish Chinese currency unit of the first two stalls so there was nothing left for it we had to go for the cheapest adjacent mystery spec system I was just frothing at the mouth for that system so we went and commissioned our mystery spec PC we're a very friendly Man spent about an hour building and setting up the system for us very excited with my cheapest ish Shenzhen special gaming system in hand we left HQ Mart Victorious but so exhausted I barely made it to my hotel room that night because of our weird Visa arrangement we had to leave China the next day so early in the morning we headed to a ferry across the bay to the beautiful Hong Kong city so I could finally tear open the box and see what kind of gaming we can do on our mystery Shenzhen system after eons of journeying were finally at a point where we can investigate our mystery spec system and see what we got for just under 300 US dollars I genuinely can't wait to see the system [Music] in terms of accessories we get a power cable and a gaming mouse pad which is a very nice touch I did actually need one of these so I'm pretty excited about it foreign oh and it is a beautiful specimen we've got some angry geometry on this front plastic bit which doesn't even pretend to have front ventilation but let's face it it's probably not gonna need it in terms of front i o we've got enough to get us going although I'm not sure if these are USB 3 or 2 ports although the side panel does make up for the lack of front ventilation with an empty 120 millimeter fan mount yeah that's the sound of sadness gaming right there and around the back we've got some surprises a reasonable if very dated looking rear i o but it comes with a dedicated graphics card which I wasn't really expecting at this price point and judging by the ports on it it's going to be a real speed demon especially considering the Mesozoic period port and then we've got a power supply that radiates the same Sinister energy as a nozgulon heat but with that let's open it up and see what kind of guts we got [Music] that actually looks pretty good granted I have no idea what kind of specs we're working with there could be a hamster with dementia under that cooler but still that's a neatly put together system now we did just get a single stick of ram which is an offense which in my opinion should be punishable by death but if there's a situation where it's excusable I I guess this is one the cooler looks a bit like an old Intel stock cooler wearing an Adidas tracksuit but depending on the CPU under there it may actually be fine and if you look at the actual heatsink it looks quite substantial compared to what the average OEM system uses and I find it kind of crazy that this cheapest shenzen system comes with the same amount of storage as a two thousand dollar MacBook Pro when it comes to the graphics card we get a legendary gt730 in this system so we're gonna get some crazy gaming performance out of it now I would be concerned by the complete lack of case fans but considering the internals were probably gonna be fine all though we do still need to figure out what CPU we have under here which we'll do once we boot up the system although what I am worried about is the power supply which despite claiming to be a powerful and extremely silent efficiently highly unit just has a 13.5 amp 12 volt rail which is pathetically tiny now when you Google translate the label it says that it's rated for 300 watts which even that feels like a bit of an exaggeration and what's with the 500 Nano in the name maybe 500 is the amount of nanoseconds these are rated to last but at least the power supply has a supplemental 8-pin power connector so that we can plug our graphics card in here and hope that it doesn't explode but despite our orphan source of a power supply I'm really impressed with how neatly put together the system is so let me put the side panel back on and it's fire it up to see what kind of gaming performance we get [Music] hey it runs so now we can find out what CPU it's packing okay so we got an i5 6400 which maybe about 500 years old at this point but it should have decent single threaded performance which means it might be able to scale with our GPU upgrade maybe oh never mind it's a single 16 gig stick that's way less forgivable now and he also split the 512 gig SSD into three partitions for some reason now it wouldn't be one of my videos if we didn't start with GTA 5 here running a 1080p normal settings which is like low and um that's that's not great is it now we are barely averaging 20 frames per second in a game that isn't exactly new at this point which isn't a very impressive performance but on the bright side we have a hundred percent GPU utilization and we aren't even getting 50 degrees Celsius on the GPU now this may just be because of the direct comparison to 19 frames per second but at 720p GTA 5 feels very playable on this system smooth almost so I guess this performance means that it is in fact a PC that you can game on but how does it behave with more demanding games I actually think uh considering what happened with GTA 5 we should probably drop this to 720p just before we even get going I mean that is going quite a bit better than I was expecting it it's by no means a playable multiplayer experience the input lag makes it feel like I'm gaming on a server on the moon but it's actually running kind of although there is a potential pretty big problem I've spotted which is that with the gt730 we're getting about a hundred percent CPU utilization which makes me think a graphics card upgrade is not gonna do a whole lot but I guess we'll find out again at least the temperatures are very good oh no way somehow cyberpunk is actually launching but launch seemingly is about as much as it does at 1080p we're getting three frames per second with low settings which again is actually a lot better than I was expecting I I wasn't expecting to be able to get into the game at all and cyberpunk does have a secret weapon super resolution now I think we're gonna have to go all the way to ultra performance so with Fidelity FX at Ultra performance we've gone from about three frames per second to 10 frames per second which is significantly better although the screen is now blank which I think may be a worthwhile trade-off potentially we could just use the minimap to drive that's fine right we're we're playing some cyberpunk this feels a bit like playing asteroids at this point clearly Fidelity FX does not like the gt730 very much which I guess makes it time to upgrade on graphics card for the graphics card I bought this Airbus A380 mainly because I've never tested one before and I could buy it for about thirty dollars less than what this card costs in the United States and that's without tax on the US price [Music] wow it even comes with a metal back plate that's pretty cool but I immediately ran into a problem so I've run into a bit of a snag um it's not got an eight pin it's just got a six pin and the A380 very much needs an eight pin so I ran to the closest thing to me resembling a PC shop which luckily had an adapter oh thank God that random tiny shop had one of these but my relief was real short-lived oh come on it's only got one Molex connector so because of the stupid power supply I had to run back to the little shop in the hell heat that is Hong Kong summer and after quite some time convincing a skeptical shopkeeper I found a potential terrifying solution okay so things are about to get properly dodgy because I went to a bunch of vendors looking for a SATA to Molex power adapters and the closest thing I could find was this which is a single Molex to dual Molex which quite frankly seems like a brilliant idea to me luckily the A380 doesn't draw too much power so it should be a okay either way it's my last option so fingers crossed I guess yeah I don't know that looks perfectly reasonable to me okay let's turn it on no signal isn't a great start but it is a new GPU let's let's give it a minute okay so I'm gonna restart it I actually don't think it works no matter what I did the system just wouldn't post well that's anticlimactic I just can't get the system to boot with the A380 in it and I don't even think it's this abomination of an adapter situation causing the problem I just think this power supply with its 13 amp 12 volt rail can't handle the system with this graphics card in it and with that the little Shenzhen special tried its best but it just couldn't handle any more power for the next video we're heading over to Japan for some PC Building Madness so subscribe to the channel if you don't want to miss that and until then bye [Music] [Music] thank you",

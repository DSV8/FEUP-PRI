    "transcript": "I've been driving my rivian truck for a little over a year now and we have over 10 000 miles on the odometer and I have not babied this thing in any way shape or form we've towed over 11 000 pounds with it we've hauled around a bunch of mulch shipped a truckload of Jerry rig knives to Linus you know did some Farm stuff filled it up with horse poop among hundreds of other trips and projects and I have some thoughts huge thanks to huel for sponsoring this video let's get started [Music] [Applause] [Music] my mom always said if I can't say anything nice then I shouldn't say anything at all and normally that's fantastic advice but today I'm still gonna go ahead and say those mean things but I am going to preface it by disclosing that this is the most fun the most powerful and the most capable truck I have ever driven and that is the definite truth but it does some super weird stuff and I'll explain more as we drive up the mountain maintenance wise over the course of the last year we have had some things go wrong the display for the compressor went out super minor issue but that had to be replaced foreign and then one of my shocks was getting jittery so I took the truck in to get that replaced under warranty the truck bed tonneau cover is still very hardcore broken there's no fix for that yet and that plastic piece for the top of the tailgate came off when I was unloading one of our new off-road wheelchair prototypes but that was mostly my fault which is pretty surprising since this truck is number 1 600 ever made and I was expecting there to be quite a few more bring it to the shop moments I did the math and my truck including all the manufacturing for the battery pack and Mining and charging off of fossil fuel grid here in Utah my truck will become cleaner than a gas-powered truck only after it drives 30 000 miles charging from solar on my house we become green a bit sooner after about 25 000. so we're still a little less than halfway to having a clean green vehicle or a vehicle that produces less carbon than its gas powered counterparts and at this specific point in time with only 10 000 miles on it my truck is still worse for the environment than say a gas powered F-150 but that will change for me around 25 000. I purposefully did not get a wrap on this truck so I could see how the paint would hold up over time and besides one rock chip on the hood near the front that probably happened while I was driving on the freeway there's only one other chip that's probably from the factory automotive paint sticking around a corner is a fairly difficult thing to accomplish but the one small chip is nothing to lose sleep over made it to the top quite a bit windier up here than I anticipated but now that we have the pleasantries out of the way let's get into the three things that I hate about my rivian starting with thing number one whenever it rains or snows inevitably water somehow gets inside of my driver's side door I'm not sure how but you can hear it sloshing around in there see if you can listen I talked to rivian about the water Ingress and they said there were vents in there to help drain the water and that they would install some bigger ones to help the liquid come out which they did but it's still happening so we look underneath the paneling it looks like there is a drain with a rubber stopper in it you can kind of see the water coming out of that hole and there's another one on this side also plugged up which is super weird part of the reason might be because EVS are so much quieter I can hear the going on to the vehicle so much better and to be fair the problem isn't that water is getting inside the door if you take a look at your current vehicle pretty much every car door should have a drain of some kind to prevent this same issue water getting into car doors is extremely normal the abnormal part is that the rivian door isn't letting the water out for example if we take a look inside a Chevy Silverado we can see a small hole in the door to let the water drain out same thing goes for a Toyota Corolla every auto manufacturer is going to have one of these holes somewhere it's weird that the drains are plugged up and maybe there's other vents somewhere else I don't know about all I know is that the door is holding water and it probably shouldn't water getting into the door is a pretty big deal and thing number two is also an extremely big deal the r1t is an electric truck and I assumed that an electric truck would just be able to do truck things I use it a lot to haul dirt and gravel and things around for our little farm and we've done quite a lot of hauling the Ruby has a Nifty little bed extending flap feature that eliminates the hinge between the bed and the tailgate which is absolutely awesome for hauling drywall or Lumber which I've also done a lot of but when hauling loose soil inevitably the dirt gets directed straight down into the large hinge opening right up into the sealed undercarriage of the truck never to be seen again it's uncanny how well the dirt just shoots right on down in there [Music] we take a little camera to scope out the internals we can see there are probably a solid two or three shovel fulls of dirt horse poop and mulch down in there that I have no access to and now I'm forever hauling around that handful of rocks and it happens on both sides of the tailgate and not to mention down there is where the battery and high voltage components are quick pause here for just one second it wasn't until I was editing this video and looking at the footage up close and personal that I realized there is a plant growing in the undercarriage of my truck I never thought I would have a literal organism hitchhiking taking a ride in the fertile undercarriage of my vehicle look at it it's all green and growing over there through the soil that has been accumulating over the past year of driving the truck it is a very strange problem to have okay back to the video I paid thousands of dollars extra for the reinforced under body protection you know the off-road package to protect me from rocks on the underside but here rocks are just coming in willy-nilly from the top side just like the exhaust port on the Death Star it's a rather large design issue and will probably become an even bigger issue in the future inside the spare wheel compartment we get a sedimentary history of all the different dirty things I've put in the bed and the wheel compartment is visibly moist humidity and metal don't always go well together so I'll definitely have to keep an eye on this compartment as well I could probably disassemble the undercarriage to let all those rocks out but I mean that's kind of annoying and I don't even know if it would work so my truck collecting rocks is the second thing that I hate most about my rivian thing one and thing two are pretty crazy and thing three gets even crazier but first we snack huge thanks to huel for sponsoring this video today we have the cookies and cream fuel Black Edition I've lost about 15 pounds since this time last year and it's all through counting calories and actually paying attention to what I eat heel black has been a big part of that change the heel black edition is a nutritionally complete shade that I can make in seconds all you have to do is add water with 40 grams of protein and 27 essential vitamins and minerals it's also exactly 400 calories which is a very easy round number to keep track of the taste of the cookies and cream is basically like a bunch of the cookies all crumbled up into a shake I like to have it with ice cubes it's all plant-based with no artificial sweeteners and has less than five percent sugar I've tried quite a few of the hewell black edition flavors like the strawberry shortcake and cinnamon roll and they're all good but if I had to pick a favorite it would be the cookies and cream if you use my link down in the description you also get a free T-shirt huel has helped me eat healthier and hopefully they can do the same for you I'll put a link down in the description and now for the third thing that I hate about my rivian hate is kind of a strong word dislike the third thing I dislike about my rivian isn't as catastrophic as the first two but it's still pretty crazy join me inside I use my truck like a work truck so there's a lot of tools inside and one time I took my tape measure and set it down on this little ledge this ledge is where cell phones go to be recharged and something very strange happened underneath the charger are a bunch of copper coils spread out so no matter where I put my phone down it'll start charging it's pretty cool however the long winding coil of my tape measure is tricking the wireless charger into thinking it's a phone and my truck is trying to charge up my tape measure with electricity [Music] literally shocking my tape measure over and over again it's not enough electricity that a human can feel it but it's still pretty crazy that my electric truck is electrocuting my tape measure I never thought my truck would get in a fight with my tools like I said issue number three isn't quite as big of a deal as the other two but it's still pretty crazy I guess the question is do those issues affect my decision if I could go back in time would I still buy this truck and the answer is yes absolutely the speed the utility and the power of this truck is better than anything else on the road right now the F-150 Lightning does come very close but I'm also not a rivian fanboy if something comes out that is substantially better than this I would have no problem switching but I also don't see that happening in the very near future let me know what you think are these issues something that would stop you from buying a truck I'm curious to see what are the deal breakers for other people and as always thanks a ton for watching and I'll see you around",

    "transcript": "in a world where hard drives are dirt cheap and SSDs are much more expensive per gig it's difficult to find a middle ground of course we all want fast storage boot times and even game load times are dramatically reduced from making the transition from hard disks to flash storage but even just a 240 gig SSD cost nearly 100 US dollars so here's a solution pairing a one terabyte hard disk drive or there abouts plenty of storage for games and movies with Intel obtain memory in a nutshell Intel obtained memory is not RAM and not an SSD instead this proprietary technology is designed on the consumer level to eliminate the latency hard drives induced when loading up an operating system or a video game let's say in a partnership with Intel we've been provided a beautiful Alienware Aurora r7 packed with a coffee lake core i7 CPU gtx 1070 and of course until obtain memory in combination with a 2 terabyte hard disk drive if you're gonna buy pre-built this is the way to go it isn't inundated with ridiculous and branding of any kind say if the supercooled Alienware power button and doesn't cost much more pre-built than and what if you decided to build it yourself with octane activated within our BIOS and in the system we're looking at a 10 second boot time this is literally SSD performance without obtain activated nearly one minute to boot up the exact same PC to open up steam right after signing in our octane powered system took 18 seconds that's compared to 53 without obtain activated again not exaggerating these numbers already says multiple times literally identical times throughout these runs so it's very consistent we only wait about 12 seconds to get universe sandbox 2 to open with octane and double that time without octane and if you're a content creator a W premiere took 10 seconds to open with octane 15 seconds without not too big a difference here but it is still worth noting but let's test an extremely large game a game much larger than the size of our obtain drive storage Grand Theft Auto 5 this is a 65 gigabyte file by the way without octane enabled it took 48 seconds to reach the main menu another 51 seconds just to enter story mode without pain enabled reaching the main menu took about 45 seconds so almost the same but here's the kicker story mode loaded in 28 seconds that's nearly twice as fast as the same system without obtain enabled gamers on a budget pay special attention this is a side-by-side comparison you can think of intel octane memory as the middleman between the cpu and hard drive it's sort of like an SSD cache except Intel's using their own chipset to facilitate optimal data file transfers which is why extremely large games like GTA 5 still manage to load much faster with octane than on a standard hard drive it's pretty cool stuff so there are some clear and undeniable advantages when combining opt in memory with a hard drive an SSD and not so much they're already pretty fast but that's not the point here if you're only sporting a hard drive with compliant Intel chipsets I guarantee you'll see clear and improved responsiveness since octane is essentially fused to your hard drive you'll see faster load and render times throughout your PC experience whereas with an SSD only those files saved directly to that drive will be quick and snappy and that's the key unless you plan on storing extremely large games and other files like GTA 5 on your SSD which Allah won't occupy is half the space of a 128 gig model they load much slower on say a one terabyte hard drive include Intel octane memory however and you get yourself a turbocharged storage system for not much more than the price of a regular disk drive itself so whether you build a PC yourself or buy pre-built especially on a budget I strongly recommend Intel obtain memory think thanks by the way to Dell and Intel for sending over this sexy Alienware over or 7 you can find this exact model link in the video description along with more info on and where you can buy Intel opt in memory if you liked this video be sure to give it a thumbs up I appreciate that click that red subscribe button down below by the way so you can get notified with more videos like these and go live this is science studio thanks for learning with us you",

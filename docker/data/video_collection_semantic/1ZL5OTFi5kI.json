    "transcript": "- Hey guys, how's it going? It's Justine and today we are unboxing the new Mavic Air. This is the latest drone by DJI and as you guys know I'm a huge drone fan. This new Mavic Air falls between the Spark and the Mavic. And we are about to do one of the first unboxings. And yes, I label my drones. Mavic Air comes in three colors as you can see illustrated right here. There's a black, a red, and a white. Don't be fooled, there is white on the front of the box, but this is actually the black version. (plastic ripping) I am so excited to try this out. It also has Smart Captures, you can use hand gestures to control the drone. It will recognize your palm, you can make it move around. More on that later. (case sliding out box) Oh, what? This is it! It has a little carrying case, oh boy! So, before we get into that I wanna see what else is in this box. I'm just taking everything out. So let's start with the controller, this doesn't have the LCD like the Mavic does. (plastic ripping) These just unhinge like that and this is right where your phone goes. One this that I am so excited about is, it has removable joy sticks. Because when you travel, it's so much easier to travel with these off. So it's pretty awesome that they have a little, tiny place here to put those. So, if you guys can see in there, that's right where these little joy sticks just unscrew and you put those right in there. (joy stick drops ) No! Oh gosh! Things were going so well. If you travel a lot with your drone and to be able to take these off and have a secure place to store them is incredible. So previously I got this little 3-D printer controller cover it just slips right over top of those little joy sticks and then you're able to travel, but this' still kind of annoying cause it's still kind of elevated. But I wanna show you guys the differences between the controllers. So this is the Mavic Air controller in comparison to the Mavic controller. As you can see this one has the LCD on it. This is the Spark, it's about the same size, it has a glossier, little top right here. Here we've got our Mavic Air accessories. Charger, we've got extra joy sticks cause as you know you're probably gonna lose one or two. Extra adapters for your controller. (accessories falling out of box) The last thing we have in the box is the power brick. So what you have here is two USB ports, and here is the plug that goes into your Mavic or your charging dock. Oh, whoa! (Justine exclaims excitedly) Guess what everybody, this is ground breaking. We have got a USB-C charger it looks like. DJI, welcome, to the club. We have a little converter and this will convert from USB-C to micro-USB. And we've got our extra joy sticks, which is perfect. I'm so glad they included these. Depending on what type of phone you have, they have two additional accessories, there's a micro-USB and a USB-C. These are easily swapped out right here on the side. And on the other side is what is currently rigged for, for your iPhone, so it has a lightning cable. There is also prop guards. (paper falling out of box) Extra propellers. So I guess the Spark and the Air both can be gesture controlled with your hands. It is recommended that if you are doing that sort of behaviors that you do put the prop guards on just to protect yourself. Or if you're a terrible drone pilot, definitely recommend doing this as well because is you hit a tree or something like that, this will protect your propellors and your drone from any little injuries. Here is the extra set of propellors. Thankfully, they give you four of them. Start guide, oh wow-ee. I'll look at that later. I just realized I didn't even open the drone yet. (Justine laughs) What am I doing? (zipper opening) (Justine gasps) This is crazy, I'm just doing like a quick glance comparison between the Mavic and the Spark, and it really is a sweet child of them both. So upon first glance, one of the things that I like is the gimbal is extremely protected. As with the Spark, one of my main concerns when I first got this one or when I'm traveling with it is, it doesn't have anything that is protecting the gimbal like this. Also, on the Mavic it has this little dome that keeps everything very safe and secure in transit. So before unfolding this thing, going over the size this is the Mavic Platinum, this is the latest release from DJI. And this here is the Mavic Air that we just unboxed. So as you guys can see it is significantly smaller than the Mavic. It seems to be about the same width but as far as height it just kinda looks like the Mavic if it got squished. The Sparks body is very small but the only issue I ever had with this one, other than the unprotected gimbal, is these arms did not fold in. Powering on and off. So it looks like the power button is on the bottom now. Their battery's dead, so I probably won't be flying this tonight. Unfold the rear arms first and then the forward. So back legs, front legs fold out. Something that's different between this and the Platinum and the Spark propellers is these ones do not fold in. So these just stay in this position. As you can see with the Mavic they fold and they move so you can just quickly put those aside like that. Oh, this whole thing just comes off. This is entirely newly designed and I really love the way that they're going. So here's what the gimbal looks like inside with the cover removed. It kinda just sort of just folded out into itself. I always get so scared when I'm putting on the gimbal protectors on the Phantom drones cuz it's just kinda hanging there and if you've ever done those before then you probably have the same feeling. I always feel like I'm gonna just break something. You guys have a Mavic, this is also a big issue too, is I always get so afraid because there's this little plastic things right here that you just pull out (nervous sigh) that will free your gimbal. Let's see what this battery looks like. Oh, I was really hoping this would be a compatible battery with some other drones that I already have but it definitely is not. This is an all new battery. What's in here? Is there gonna be a USB-C? Yes, there is! So right here in the front this flips down and there is a little micro-SD card slot and also a USB-C port, right there in the front. Now that our unboxing is complete I'm gonna go charge this thing up and then take it out for a test flight. Who's ready for a drone adventure? - [Jenna] Me! - It is very windy so there may be a chance we can't even fly. We'll see what happens. (slow upbeat music) We made it. It is a really nice day today. (slow upbeat music) We are out here about to test out the new Mavic Air. These come in two different models. The Fly More package is $999 which comes with two extra batteries, a traveling case, the controller, two extra sets of propellers. Where as the normal drone starts at $799 which is pretty much in between the Spark and the Mavic Pro. You'll get about 21 minutes of flight time so depending upon how skilled you are, how windy it is, all those conditions will effect how much battery life you'll get. So we're gonna test out a couple of the shooting modes. The first one we're gonna try out is 4K 30FPS this will also shoot 2.7K to 60FPS and also 1080p 120FPS. So let's test 'em out and see what we can see. (upbeat music) (pop music) So now we're gonna test out Smart Capture. So basically Smart Capture will allow you to control your drone with the palm of your hand. When you place your palm up it'll recognize you and enter into follow mode. When you raise your hand up or down, left or to the right, the drone will follow you. Even if you put your palm down and start walking around since it is in follow mode, it'll follow you wherever you go. You can also control the drones direction. If you wanted to move forward or backwards you just drifts your hands slightly apart or bring them back together to bring the drone closer to you. There's a few different gestures that you can do. If you hold up the peace sign your drone will take your picture. If you hold up a little picture frame just like this, it'll start recording video. You can also land the drone using the palm control but I got a little bit worried cuz I was in the sand and I didn't want it to get sandy so I just landed it manually. (upbeat music) So right now we are flying with both of our drones in the air. So Nathan's Phantom 4 is filming my Mavic Air. It's a drone inception. Wow, should I move somewhere or do you want me to do something or like should I just not move? - [Nathan] You can just fly around a little bit and I'll follow you - [Justine] Okay, how's this? You see me? Oh my god, you were scaring me. It looked like you were very close to me. (laughs) This thing, it's super industrial. 22 thousand milli-amps. So we've got the new Mophie, it's an A/C adaptor, so it has an A/C input so we're recharging this battery now for the Mavic air through this Mophie. I'm ready for the apocalypse. Well guys, that concludes our Mavic Air flight test. I had so much fun flying this thing. Let me know what you guys think of the footage and let me know what you guys think of this sexy, new little drone. Ah, I'm so excited to play with this thing more. I'll see you guys later - [Nathan] You didn't let me fly. - Oh shoot, I didn't. - You didn't let me fly it at all. - I didn't even let Nathan fly. - No, you didn't let me fly, this is complete bull crap. - [Jenna] Wait, I didn't get to fly it! - I only have one battery. - You didn't let Jenna fly it. - I'm sorry, tomorrow morning we're gonna go fly some more so. Yep, tomorrow morning we fly. (upbeat music)",

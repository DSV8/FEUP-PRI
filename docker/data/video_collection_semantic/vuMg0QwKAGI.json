This video was launched in 2020 a lot has changed since then and prices have increased:  we do not make any profit off this machine. We wanted to create something affordable, and capable and I think we've done it! Huge thanks to Utah Trikes for their help designing and manufacturing The Rig. We hope it brings as many miles of happiness, adventure, and exploration to you as it has done for us. Designing an affordable bike that happens to be accommodating has taken us more than a year and a half. Of course we plan on building and improving The Rig over the next few years.

    "transcript": "So about a year ago I welded two electric bikes together as an off-road wheelchair of sorts to surprise my then girlfriend, Cambry. -And almost immediately after that we put our brains together to figure out ways to improve it. -Weve come a long way. Now my wife and I have a surprise for you guys. Our whole goal was to make an affordable and capable off-road wheelchair and mass produce them. -Wed like to introduce Not A Wheelchair. -We call it The Rig. -Lets get started. [Intro] [Music] -So weve been through several different versions of this Rig over the past year. Now we finally have something were really excited about. Its hard to define exactly what this is. You know, what do you call a chair with four wheels, off-road capabilities, its totally silent, super fast, and a great long range? Im not really sure either, but its definitely Not A Wheelchair. So let me tell you a little bit about The Rig. Its got the four tires. Its got the single motor with a solid rear axle in the back so theres traction between both of those tires. And its actually designed to have weight in the back. We have six different mounting points so that you can put a rack for a wheelchair, or coolers for camping all kinds of stuff back here. The Rig is mostly built from bike parts, from the rotors, calipers, hydraulic brake system, the e-bike motor, and the e-bike batteries. The version Cambrys riding right now has two batteries on the back. The batteries on the back determine how far The Rig can go. One battery can go anywhere from ten-twenty miles depending on how much weight The Rig is carrying. With the front bumper off, The Rig is exactly 5 feet long and 32 inches wide, meaning that The Rig can fit in the back of short bed pickups with the tail gate up. And also jeeps and even Subaru Outbacks. Its a fairly portable system. And being 32 inches wide means it can fit through most doorways. Plus the bike has the ability to go forward and reverse, which is fairly beneficial. [Loud motor noise] [Person on side by side] That is cool. [Zack] Thank you, I appreciate it! Wait for it. So there are some off-road vehicles that are very loud. Ours is not one of those. Since its totally electric, there is literally no sound coming from the motor, which makes for a more realistic nature experience. -Its a more peaceful environment when your off-road device isnt making loud noises. Personally, I love my light blue Rig. Weve put over a thousand miles on it, and its taken me places I never in a million years thought I could go. Like on a hike to a waterfall in Hawaii. Or up the canyon on packed snow. Which are all places I wouldnt be able to go in my normal wheelchair. -Weve taken The Rig in quite a few different placesup the canyon, paved roads, dirt roads, gravel roads, and it does handle pretty well. But it does struggle a bit with loose sand, loose snowyou know, kind of just like any bike would. Remember, this is definitely Not A Wheelchair and doesnt have the fine tuning or precision that you would normally find in a medical device. Its definitely a bike with all the quirks and maintenance that comes with all bikes. Its not beach ready and has no IP water resistance rating yet, but maybe at some point in the future. We have to leave some things to look forward to with version 2 whenever that comes out. We teamed up with the largest trike manufacturer in the United States, Utah Trikes, to build this contraption. And since we use bike parts for most of the construction, replacement parts and tools are easy to find and can be purchased all over the Internet or from local bike shops. So Cambry did want this thing to be super fast, but for her safety Ive limited it to 12 miles an hour. -You may be curious where you can take this Rig, and according to the American Disability Act, or the ADA, other power driven mobility devices are allowed to go on all areas where members of the public are allowed to go, which is basically everywhere. So if you are driving The Rig, and have a medically recognized physical impairment, you can basically go anywhere as long as its safe. If you want to buy one of these and you dont have a physical impairment, you can still ride it of course, but there may be more restrictions as to where you can go. -So you might be asking yourself, Hey Jerry, how does Cambry get in and out of the chair? And its actually pretty easy. Down here at the bottom theres a little latch that I can unclip, and the handle tilts totally backwards. Cambry can grab her chair, undo her feet from the little Velcro things -Lift them over the wheel, and viola! Im in the chair! -Remember, this is not a medical device. Its a modified electric bike that just happens to be more accessible. The throttles taken from an electric bike, the motors taken from an electric bike. Even the batteries are taken from an electric bike. You might be thinking as well that off-road wheelchairs are super expensive and youre right. Normal off-road wheelchairs can cost anywhere from $10,000-20,000. This Not A Wheelchair only costs $4,750, which is half the price and twice the specs of a normal off-road wheelchair. -We do have a totally stock version thats $1,000 cheaper, but it doesnt have the drop down handles, suspension, and it just comes in black. -We are ready to start manufacturing these right now. I will leave a link for these in the video description. Theres no Kickstarter or anything. Or you can just go to NotAWheelchair.com and well start shipping in September 2020. Alright Cambry, I think thats it. Anything else we should mention? -Yeah. If you want to help out with this project, you can go to our website where theres a donation page and you can donate any amount you want to help us get these to more people that can use them. -And come hang out with us on Instagram at Not A Wheelchair. Well be sharing our own adventures as well as adventures of other people who have these contraptions. You know, the most important thing is to be safe, use the buddy system, wear a helmet, but have fun. Thanks a ton for watching. Well see you around. [Music]",

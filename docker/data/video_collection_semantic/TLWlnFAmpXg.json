    "transcript": "now if you have a tech youtube channel and you get to i'd say the threshold is about 5 000 subscribers you start to get inundated with weirdly complimentary spam emails from tech manufacturers wanting you to review their random product and they usually go along the lines of wow nice to meet you insert channel name here your content brings me great joy and inspiration if you review my usb hub that also has dog toenail clippers in it it will bring me to glorious climax and usually my response to this kind of email is to politely ignore them because why would i want to review a bluetooth headset that can also refrigerate coconut water for some reason but then i woke up the other morning and i was like why am i not reviewing this stuff so i asked anna to reach out to five varyingly obscure review sample requests from the last week so that we can all marvel at them together but before we do some marveling it's time for a quick word from today's video sponsor today's video is sponsored by deepcool and their awesome looking new ls series of aios that come in a range of sizes from 120 millimeter up to 360 millimeters for them hot boy cpus the new deep cool ls series aios come with daisy chainable fans some rgb goodness and deepcool's new fourth generation pump which apparently has improved micro channel design ensuring optimal coolant flow if all of this sounds good to you check out the new ls series of deep cool aios using the link in the description below thank you deepcool for sponsoring today's video now it's been several years but we finally have the stuff and it's really cool to finally get to actually see some of the random crap you get offered on a daily basis and no offense to the people making this random crap of course so with that let's start off with this one the first product happened to be from a very popular category usb hub plus gimmick and this one has an m.2 slot right in the usb hub accessory wise you get some thermal pad a silicon case and a cable look at that opens like that and then this is where uh the m.2 ssd goes it feels pretty solid you know it's like a a pretty sturdy nice feeling bit of kit and while looking at all of the ports on offer by this very sturdily constructed usb hub you could tell that i was impressed uh yeah i don't really know what else to say about it it's it's a usb hub in terms of price apparently this occasion is a hundred dollars and you have to buy it off their site but we'll do some testing with it later we've got a wearable smart air conditioner straight off the bat i was struggling with the impossible to read writing on the side of the box apparently done by someone falling down an escalator but once i got over my confusion i was quite excited i am a hot boy right to me if it's above 17 degrees celsius i am sweating and uncomfortable so this actually seems like a great product for me the outside of this case looks and feels a little bit like how i imagine asbestos looks and feels that's a concerning start hopefully this isn't a carcinogen well there is a whole lot of branding on this case go like that and wow that looks like a very adventurous sex toy kind of pop it you just kind of put it on like that and then you feel really cool although actually it is already very cold to the touch and it's doing a good job cooling my very high body temperature down and it's not even powered on so that's a good sign now having a look at it one of the first things that stands out to me is that um it's not very big and there's no size adjustability so if you're one of those people that has like an upturned dish ball for a neck this is not going to work at all for you because it's already kind of chafey and it's it's not quite big enough for my neck so the ice swift is 250 us dollars for this little air conditioner it's not very well reviewed on amazon so out of eight reviews it's it's got three stars whoa there's a lot of stuff in here we've got a sealed envelope in here uh that says yours ever very elaborately folded letter how do i open it as i struggle opening this note it's basically just a reviewer's guide written in quite flowery language doogie stepping up with some style the first little box had several skins for the back of the phone ranging from carbon fiber effect to wood effect so they're kind of like a case with extra steps oh they've included smart glasses as well they have kind of snuck a second product into this review which i feel like is cheating a little bit as a glasses wearer myself that is not a very good glasses hinge i wonder if these are also ip69 rated or if you're just going to be electrocuted if it rains on you which kind of seems like it may be the case these have speakers built in which i can just imagine sound atrocious yeah that i feel so cool i think that these glasses with this i mean i now look like the techiest person in the world and while you try your best to control your rampant arousal for how sexy i look with all this tech on me let's check out the doogie phone oh that is a big phone in terms of accessories we get a kind illusory 10 watt wall wart a cable and a lanyard thing oh and a screen protector you can see it's one of those two off phones for people that i guess recreationally sword battle it's surprisingly comfortable in the hand doogie wasn't lying it does feel decent in the hand it is quite a big phone okay so that's the sim card slot you can actually put two sim cards in here with a memory card on the other side we've got a fingerprint sensor and a volume rocker you have a covered up usb c port which means this thing can just do lots of water and stuff can happen to it oh look at that the phone has a headphone jack which means already it is the best phone in the world at the moment because you can actually plug the headphones into it although it's an even more exciting feature is apparently this phone has a night vision camera in it which i am definitely going to try tonight now next up we have the little g-com mini air 11 which is a mini pc now i would say about 70 of the emails we get are from people with mini pcs there's a surprising amount of them specs wise we have a celeron n5095 in it and as we know the name celeron is synonymous with power we also have eight gigs of ram and a 256 gig ssd and then here is the very mini pc it is it is very small the little mini pc also comes with a nicely printed card but this one is for customer support information not bribery underneath that we have a little velvet effect carrying bag so you can transport your mini pc in style there's also a power brick a mini displayport to hdmi adapter some mounting screws damn an hdmi cable as well you even get a vase amount for it in the box often these manufacturers have those as like an optional accessory so it's nice to have it included in the box on the front there's a little bit of i o on the back there's a bit more i o and a vent with a pretty significant looking heatsink in there so that's promising in fact generally ventilation on this little device does seem pretty good now it may not have a lot of ports on it but at least they're good modern ports all in all i can't wait to fire up the little gecko maybe try and play some games on it and see how much horsepower we get from the little celeron but first we have one more thing to unbox before we get to the review segment this which is the fopo that is a nice looking box you've got some elevated print on the top and you can see here that it's kind of like a thing that sits on your monitor and gives you two extra displays on it okay oh so this is the kind of thing that i assume they want you to carry around with your laptop but it's it's big and it's heavy it's not that portable but you know we'll get into that in a bit it comes with all of the cables which adds to the immediate concern around portability for this thing it even comes with a wall wart i guess it just kind of folds like that i think the other display folds up from the bottom why is this one on the bottom there's more of a disconnect between where the two displays sit in relation to the middle monitor it seems like a bit of a weird thing but i'm excited to try it out because in theory it's quite cool if you have it closed like that the display is on the outside so it's gonna be easily damaged it's a very flimsy little stand that feels real weak and with my skepticism growing fast of the fopo we've finally unboxed all of the products which means it's time for the review section of the video first things first what's the venereal bloatware situation like on the little geekcon whoa that is a very clean windows install good job little geekom here is our little quad-core acceleron oh and a single 8 gig stick of ram who would have seen that coming we also have some intel uhd graphics so gaming should be very interesting on this little geekom mini pc okay so anything in the ballpark of gta 5 at 1080p low settings is not really feasible on this little pc uh so let's drop it down to 720p maybe that'll work oh i guess if you have very low standards this is fine bear in mind this is not at all what it's designed to do and considering that this is quite an impressive showing also the temperatures are great and it's nice and quiet however i wouldn't really consider this playable so let's quickly try a game that should run on this little system it's not running super well but at 1080p high settings half-life 2 is definitely playable which means you can do at least medium gaming on this little geekom it can handle 4k 60 video the cpu is fast enough that you don't have a frustrating windows experience on it in terms of cpu performance you're looking at about third generation i5 which for a pc that small is actually not that bad and you can even emulate older games so yeah it's a solid little mini pc oh and in terms of price it comes in at 280 us dollars and as far as i'm concerned the only real problem i have with the little geekom is that it doesn't quite have enough i o luckily we have a solution to that problem the occasious usb hub very smooth review transition there now i'm not entirely sure how to review a usb hub because surely if you plug things into it and it usbs it's fine uh but i guess i'll go a bit deeper than that now using the 10 gigabit usb c port on the little geekom this is the result we get which is not great considering that in that caddy we have a wd black nvme drive so the caddy is bottlenecking that ssd quite a bit so let's see how much that changes with the aces damn having the occasions in the chain lost us about half our transfer speed and that's with just one of the ports being used with that i sense a contender entering the arena to give us some context now i've also tested it with a different usb c hub i happen to have lying around and we get about the same results so with my sample size of two i've determined that this is the industry standard usbc data throughput result and now the last thing we're going to do is test a little ssd caddy in here now it's about 25 slower than the silverstone caddy which is not ideal but at least it's faster than the usb ports on the hub so at the end of the day the usb hub does usb hub things uh although i will say my main complaint with it is that it doesn't really have enough usb ports on it which i feel like is quite a fundamental failure on a device like this two square usb ports just feels insufficient you can just plug a mouse and keyboard into this thing and then you need a usb hub for your usb hub which seems really dumb i don't know i feel like to me the minimum requirement is at least four square usb ports uh but maybe i have unrealistic expectations so let me know in the comment section down below what you think and then with that i'm gonna stop talking about the usb hub now and move on to something else now next up we're gonna test the neck aircon which i have over here uh that's clearly been designed either for children or people with very skinny necks so i guess we just kind of slide it on there and then okay it's beeped oh um now my first impression is that it's very noisy it's kind of unsettling because it's blowing air right up into the base of my ears and i i don't know it feels weird it feels like someone's blowing really hard on the back of my neck but like not someone i know or want to have blowing on my neck i don't know it's just it it doesn't feel as consensual as i feel like it should um can do i just turn it down there we go that's a bit less jarring i think it was on max power it's still very noisy though i don't know if i want something going in my ears the whole time this is not my kind of device but i think i'll like it more if i augment it with the the doogie glasses so let's let's put the doogie glasses on ah it just spoke into my ear ah kaichi what um okay i think it's on oh okay it's trying to connect to bluetooth so let me quickly get my phone i mean i have to say my neck is a lot cooler than it was before in fact i'm actually getting a little cold uh so i think it's quite effective although again it just it feels like there are two people behind me blowing on my ears i i don't love that uh but let's do bluetooth it just said elencia in my ear so i think that means connected in chinese i'm assuming and at this point i spent the next five minutes struggling to connect the doogie smart glasses to my phone but i got there eventually the speakers are happening but they are about as terrible as you would imagine speakers in sunglasses to be that that is some of the worst audio i think i've ever heard like the sound is shockingly bad sorry about that doogie it's a little bit of a fail but getting back to the actual like aircon headset um it's cooling me quite effectively like i i feel cold at this point it just invades my personal space bubble somehow and another issue that i have with it is because of how kind of silicony it is it's gonna get disgusting instantly so i think sweat wise and stuff it's not gonna be great yeah if you have a skinny neck and you don't mind people blowing in your ear then yeah maybe this is the very expensive product for you uh with that let's try something else now we need to kind of unfold this thing so i think this is the back this feels really scary to interact with it's very precarious and then you kind of do that wow this thing feels like it's going to break at any second but you can kind of it's got like a ratchet and then come on i hope that the side monitor doesn't fall off and then um and then on the back here which is going to be very dark but on the back here this stand is all that keeps it in place okay there we go i think this fopo multi-monitor thing is a marmite product now i'm pretty sure i've used this analogy on the channel before but for those of you that don't know marmite is like a yeast based sandwich spread that has like a black tarry consistency and there is no middle ground with marmite you either fanatically love it or you gag just at the thought of it now the reason i think this is a marmite product is because after struggling to set it up i sat back looked at it and thought wow that's really dumb wait a minute didn't i remember seeing a linus thumbnail with one of these in so i went and watched linus's video on a different version of one of these products and actually there's a pretty serious patent legal battle going on between two of these companies over intellectual property theft i don't think foppo is involved with that although i may be wrong let me know in the comment section down below anyway i watched this video where linus and the person helping him review it are just giddy with excitement about this thing they're like wow this is a pretty janky implementation but it's such a promising product whereas for me it doesn't get me giddy i just think it's kind of a dumb idea now i fully understand this is not a product designed for me i'm not one of those productivity power users or whatever the term is that wants as many displays around me as possible my idea of productivity is sitting in front of a single good monitor with premiere pro for 12 hours editing until my eyes bleed right i don't want a bunch of displays with distracting crap around me but i do understand that a lot of people like that a lot of people want that kind of thing around them and even taking that into account i still think this is a dumb product laptops almost fundamentally are about portability that's why laptops keep getting smaller and thinner so that it's easier for you to carry it around so if you introduce a product that is if anything bigger than the average laptop that you have to carry around with you and every time you have to set up the thing you put your laptop down you have to spend a bunch of time struggling with the big dumb plastic thing being very careful to not have one of the flaps fall down and break one of the displays on the desk and after you've got it set up with the little stand on the back so your display doesn't fall over you then have to plug it into every piece of i o on your laptop for the thing to work and then after going through all of that effort what you're rewarded with is two karna crappy laptop displays that don't match the color temperature of your main laptop display which is gonna drive you crazy but you know you have a lot of space for productivity and whatever however someone's gonna call you like 20 minutes later and you have to tear the whole thing down and move it somewhere else it's just not practical now some of you may be thinking but darwin maybe it's not very portable but this is the kind of thing that you can set up at home for more monetary real estate on your laptop but if you're going to use it at home why not just get a proper monitor this thing costs 650 us dollars you can buy a super badass monitor for 650 dollars in fact you can buy three pretty good monitors for 650 dollars why would you want to use this at home so it doesn't work for portability it doesn't work at home when are you supposed to use it so i'm sorry fopo i think that this thing is just a gimmick and i am willing to bet money that even if you think that this thing isn't a bad idea if you buy one you'll use it like five maybe six times and then never take it out with you again because you realize you make terrible life decisions so again sorry fopo i don't like your thing very much but uh yeah we need to move on to the next product so let's check it out now the hinge on this right display can't really handle the weight of the two cables even yeah like there's a very specific angle where it actually holds it the final product we're going to look at in today's video is the little doogie houser smartphone which is a 200 tough phone and i'm going to be honest i don't have a lot of personal experience with 200 smartphones but after doing a quick google it's a very competitive space like there are a lot of options and even in terms of like tough phones there are a lot of options and that's a bit of a problem for the doogie because this isn't a very good smartphone the display while very bright is is pretty bad the phone isn't particularly fast none of the biometrics on it really work like i've only been able to get the fingerprint sensor to work once so let's give it a try now um so you lift i got it first try that is the okay that that is a weird coincidence because that's the first time that's happened but most of the time it's just me sitting there struggling with it so let's try again maybe you just needed time to learn my finger let's give it let's try again i spent a lot of time yesterday struggling to unlock this phone using the fingerprint sensor and now it's just working okay so never mind apparently it has an amazing fingerprint sensor in it but still my point stands considering the competition out there i i think it's a really tough market for this phone to compete in like you can buy a renewed samsung galaxy s 10 plus for 200 off of amazon now there is some dubious future software support for a device that old but still in pretty much every category an s10 plus is a better phone than the doogie houser aside from one pretty amazing selling point for this phone now when i got it home i used it a little bit and i was like oh this is a bit lame and then in the middle of the night i brought up the night vision camera now this is a picture using the normal camera and then this is a picture using the night vision camera it turns your cat into a demon it's really cool and because it uses like ir flashlights it means that even in pitch black darkness this camera works it does have a downside though it has live preview but you can't record video with it which means if like me you wanted to immediately buy one of these to film the blair witch project with uh that you're kind of out of luck that's not gonna work but still i think the night vision camera is one of the more interesting gimmicks i've seen on a phone in a while and that on its own almost is worth the price of the phone so yeah that's my opinion on the doogie which brings me to the end of the video let me know in the comment section down below which product you thought was the coolest and which one you thought was the least cool now in my opinion the coolest one or at least the one that has a use and met expectation the most was maybe the little mini pc uh the one i liked the least you're not gonna be surprised by this one unfortunately is the fopo thing i'm sorry fopo i just don't like the concept and i think the only way that it would make sense in like a real world application is if it was natively part of the laptop like if it was just a bit of display that you could fold out and you didn't have to use every piece of i o on your laptop to use it kind of like that razer uh thing even in that case i don't think it's anything more than a gimmick uh but let me know if you think i'm wrong in the comment section down below uh thank you for watching maybe watch another video suggestion will pop up in a second and until the next video bye-bye foreign",

    "transcript": "- Welcome to TechLinked, the only tech news show. - [Riley] That's not exactly true. I mean, there's- - The only tech news show. - [Riley] Uh... - Intel is continuing on the warpath it was set on by warm and cuddly CEO Pat Gelsinger. He's always smiling. - [Riley] He's a very nice man. - Very nice. - I think. - And he so nice that he poached another one of AMD's top graphics architects. - [Riley] Oh, gotcha! - Rohit Verma, AMD's former lead system architect for discreet GPUs, is now back at Intel. Yeah, he actually left Team Blue in 2013 after 14 years working there, and has worked at AMD for the past eight, playing a key role in designing the last few generations of Radeon GPUs, which were actually pretty good. - Were they? - Like, I mean, Vega was whatever. For the price, it was pretty good. - Okay. - And RDNA 2. (gunshot effect sounds) You'd better bet that that's pretty good. - Okay! - Yep. Although I'd understand if most gamers didn't know that, not actually being able to buy any. - Bam. - Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha. - Shortage, bam. - Ha ha, ha ha ha, ha. GPU shortage. Rohit joins Raja Koduri, a former Radeon graphics chief, in making the blue switch, as I like to call it. I gotta tell ya, if Intel's gaming cards aren't good, I will feel like I've wasted so much time talking about them. - [Riley] Can you imagine, they come out, and they're just (beep). - That would be such an Intel thing to do. (Riley laughs) Sony has finally unveiled the design of it's new PS VR2 virtual reality headset, along with the finalized design of the PS VR2 controllers. And let me tell you, this baby looks smooth. (Riley whistles) I feel like it might just slide right off your face, you know? - It looks slick. - Its just goes... - Just looks slimy. - Yeah. The PS VR2 borrows heavily from the PS5's design with a black body covered in white plates. So dbrand, we will be expecting you to risk legal action from Sony to design custom plates for this. Thank you. - [Riley] Thank you. - Thank you. [Anthony] If you weren't aware, this headset is meant specifically for use with a PlayStation 5, so if you were excited about using Meta's newly announced Builder Bot tool that lets you speak virtual places and objects into existence, PS VR2 won't help you. Or it will, by stopping you from doing that. - [Riley] It's doing you a favor. - Yeah. Actually doing you a solid. Don't do it. - Do not. - Don't! Get away from there. - [Riley] Get outta that metaverse! - Nope, nope. Nope. It's coming! (both laugh) - [Riley] Okay. - And Nvidia's infamous ethereum mining limiter on its Lite Hash Rate GPUs, which the company described as unhackable, (Riley laughs) may have been finally well and truly hacked. The developer of the Nvidia RTX LHR v2 Unlocker, which is not a mouthful, claims that it will completely unlock the full mining performance of LHR graphics cards when it launches this weekend. This weekend. - [Riley] Wow. - And all of Nvidia's hopes and dreams go down the toilet. - [Riley] Go all in. - But before all you crypto nuts eagerly download it into your thirst for digitized coin, beware! There is currently a battle going on in the GitHub comments over whether the tool is actually just malware, with some users posting screenshots of antivirus programs flagging the tool's EXE file as malicious. Although is nothing new for weird third-party things, so- - Oh. - You never know. Apparently, GitHub is already looking into it, so hopefully by the time this video comes out we may have some answers. Personally, I just want to find out if it's real so I know whether this unhackable meme will survive. - [Riley] Yeah. - You know what's really unhackable? - What? - Me. And now it's time for the Quick Bits, brought to you by Manscaped. Oh, they're into hacking. And their Ultra Premium Collection, the all-in-one skin and hair care kit for the everyday man and covers every body part: butt, balls, body... - Those three parts. - The three parts! (laughs) Butt, balls, and body! That's right, the Ultra Premium Kit has shampoo, for your butt, body wash for your balls, hydrating spray and deodorant, to make man maintenance easier than ever. And in case you thought man couldn't care about negative impacts in the world, these products are cruelty-free, paraben-free, and vegan. - Pew! - Pew! Eye lasers. So, eye lasers. Go to manscaped.com and use promo code TECH for 20% off your order, plus free international shipping. If you've never tried Quick Bits before, well you're about to be Bitsed. - [Riley] What does that mean? - All I can say is hold on. (Riley laughs) Samsung made a big deal about it's new 45W charger for the Galaxy S22 lineup. But a number of tech outlets have determined that the difference in charging speed compared to Samsung's 25W charger is negligible at best. In fact, GSMArena found that using a third-party 65W charger produces around the same charge in the same time as both of Samsung's chargers. Sure, the phone might be shy, and we're making it worse by talking about it, but you should still probably avoid shelling out the extra cash for the 45W charger. Don't be an enabler. - [Riley] It should be ashamed. - It... - It should be shy. - It should be shy. There are some things that you should be shy about. Bethesda has announced that it will be retiring it's first party game launcher app on Windows. Thank you. And will help gamers move their games and DLC to Steam, leading to much rejoicing amongst gamers. I would rejoice! - [Riley] Yes. - Who saw this coming? This is a Microsoft studio now. - [Riley] Probably, yeah. - We've generally hated the app since it launched back in 2016. Yes. It's usually not great to see platforms consolidated like this, like... But sometimes, monopoly can be good. - [Riley] Yeah. - Like when you win the board game. Amazon's Astro robot seemed super sketchy when the tech giant announced it last year, but videos are now starting to emerge from early adopters showing the robot creepily but accurately following instructions, such as roll to, like, a specific room, or to find a specific person. - [Riley] Oh, gross! - [Anthony] Apparently it hasn't fallen down any stairs like it was expected to, but let's hold onto hope. - [Riley] Could still happen. - It could still happen, and when it does, we'll have won. Apple's VR/AR headset is supposedly actually getting closer to launch, with a new Digitize report claiming that Apple is now in the 2nd-phase validation of the unit's design, with a launch targeted for late 2022. - [Riley] That's me, too. (laughs) - [Riley] I'm the second phase. - You're gonna launch in late 2022? - [Riley] I think so. - Honestly, if I was gonna jump into anybody's metaverse, it would probably be Apple's. I'm not even joking. I don't know if I can take many more of Zuck's hydrofoil jokes. Cool, you reclaimed the meme, but now you're killing it. - [Riley] What even is that? Do people know what that is? A hydrofoil? - I don't know. Like, I mean, what is- - Remember when I did that? - The last time I played with a hydrofoil was Diddy Kong Racing. And Elden Ring, the intensely hyped game from Dark Souls developer FromSoftware and Game of Thrones creator George R.R. Martin, is apparently a freakin' masterpiece. It's now surpassed Super Mario Odyssey as the highest-rated game on OpenCritic. Now, that said, it is a souls-like game, so there's still a healthy amount of suffering involved. But it's the fun kind of suffering, you know? - Yeah, you know. You know the kind. - Yeah. And your suffering has now ended, Tech News Night. Come back on Friday for more, because where else are you gonna get it? - [Riley] Well, there's a few other, like Paul's Hardware, does- - Nowhere!",

    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine right here with Ro. - Hello! - So we filmed a really fun video on her channel, and I'm so excited because after that, we came over here again to do something very, very fun. Okay, so I recently went to Disney. - Yes! - And I hadn't been to Disney in over a year and a half, and I used to have an annual pass. Like we used to go all the time. We went that one time. - Yes! - Disney's back. (Rosanna gasps) - It's back. They also have the Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge. So I never had gone, Jenna had gone to the press event and was able to like ride the rides and go see everything, so I never got to see it. And they have this thing, it's Savi's workshop where you can make - What? - a freakin' lightsaber! - Oooooooooh snap! - So I have two of them here. So you kind of go in and you get to pick what kind of saber you want. When you go in, they give you one of these pins so that you know, like, which camp you're in. And then they give you the pieces for it. So like, it's this whole thing. - It's a whole thing. - It's a whole thing. So we need to go back - Wow! - and do this again. But I brought the sabers today. I haven't even actually got to see them outside of Disney. So... - They're huge. - Yes. - I mean, they're massive. They're, these are not like little dinky... - No, no, no. - These are huge sabers here. I feel like you're about to pull out a sword. - Basically. Look at this! - Whoa! - So this was the one that was Peace and Justice. So it's crazy because they give you all of these pieces and then you put it together yourself. (lightsaber buzzing) - No! - Yeah, you get to choose the color crystal. So here's the crystals. - [Rosanna] What! - I lost my mind, because after you make this, they then take you into, like, this little workshop area and you can buy, like, extra crystals, - Oh, that's cool. - Depending... Yeah. So this is Yoda's crystal. I think this one, I think Ahsoka had this one, - Oh wow! - and obviously like Luke and Obi-Wan had the blue. And this other one, I chose the purple. - This is cool. - Same color. - Oh my gosh, look, little Yoda. - It's so cool. Okay. This one is, this one's really aggressive. - Whoa, another one! - Check this one out. - Okay, okay, let's see it. (lightsaber buzzes) That's cool. It makes noise when you move it? - It does. You know I've been doing, like, lightsaber training? - Yes! - Okay, well, - I - these are not, - I wanna do this. these are not ones that you fight with. These are, like, the - These are like... art pieces. Do you want to hold it? Just like that, it's okay. - Oh my gosh, it's got weight to it. Like this is, like, the real deal. Wow! - I know. - Oh, oh wow. - It's heavy. - Oh yeah, that's a workout. Okay, are there any colors, which are, do you remember any colors of, I don't wanna say the bad guys, but yeah, like... - It's usually red, - The bad guys - Kylo Ren. - Always wore a lot of red. - Yeah, so they're usually always red. So these little crystals here, - [Rosanna] The crystals. - [Justine] Yeah, so these open up. And this... Get out of there, little dude. (gasps) So there's the little crystal. - Shut up, that's so cool. - So this goes inside of the saber and that's how you change the color. So I lost my mind. - This is incredible. - I had to buy every color. - This is so incredible. - Do you know- - No. - What color do you think you would want your saber to be? - Probably not red. I mean, I could rock it, but I don't think I'd be a red. I'm not really about that empire. I'm more of a rebel. - Yeah, I think I would probably do a pink, I don't think anybody has a pink. I mean, the closest color, I guess would be the purple. - Oh my gosh! Oh! What! I don't know how I just did that, Justine. - That's okay, this little button right here. (lightsaber buzzes) - Okay, I have never had any Jedi training- - That's okay. - or lightsaber training, so I don't know what I'm doing. - Today you will. (Rosanna gasps) So inside here, they also have pre-made ones of basically like every Jedi. And of course I love Rey, so I had to buy Rey's lightsaber. - I haven't even opened it yet. (Rosanna exclaims) This is really exciting. - There, there, oh, oh wow. - Oh, look at this! - This is fancy. - Oh shoot. - This is- - Yeah, looks really, really nice. - Actually, this is even cooler than these ones, actually. - I feel like it's way nicer than these- - Yeah! - and these are really nice. - Wow. You wanna check that out? - Oh my gosh. Oh, wow. - [Justine] Right? - Wow. - [Justine] It's like actual, real. - It's heavy duty. - We can't actually fight with these 'cause these are more just kind of like props, like, okay, these look cool. - Yeah. - What we need - What? - Are stunt sabers. - A stunt saber? - Yeah. - So these ones we use to actually like hit each other with. So I was thinking maybe we can go in the backyard, and (Rosanna gasps) you know, test it out. - Yes. Okay. - Yes. Okay, yes! Teach me some lightsaber skills 'cause I have none. (lightsaber buzzes) (lightsaber zings) - And feel how light this is. This is so much lighter than these ones. (lightsaber buzzes) - Oh yeah. - Should we, should we go outside? Okay. Oh gosh. (Star Wars music) - Okay, Ro, we're outside now. This is really fun. Like, basically this kind of stems from a couple different martial arts, bo staff spinning Kali, which is like a Filipino martial arts, so it's usually with, like, two sticks. But then when my trainer was like, hey, we should do lightsaber training, I was like, why didn't you tell me that this was a thing? So we've been doing this and it's really fun. So there's a bunch of different moves. I think I'll probably- - Okay, show off a little bit, - Okay. - show me some stuff, Justine. So, you know, we're just doing a little of this. - [Rosanna] Wow! - You know, just, (Rosanna exclaims) a little bit of... - [Rosanna] Just a little sabering! - The basic thing that you want to get down is like this simple little move right here. - What you do? - So just kind of roll your wrist a little. You're just kinda like letting it go, so it's kind of going between your two fingers. You got it! - Is this it? - You're doing it! - Ow, shot one! Down, - Yeah. - Up. - That's good! - Okay! - And then you're going to want to kind of do one of these. - Whoa, whoa. - I'm a really bad teacher. - Whoa, whoa, okay, show me what you just did. - Okay, so you're doing this, - You're doing the flippy-floppy. - And then you're gonna do one of these and bring it around and then back again. - Behind your back? - Yeah, so I don't really know how to explain it. - Okay, do it again. - Okay. - Do it again, let me see. - So we're doing this, we're doing this, we're doing this. And then it comes around and then you're kind of flinging your elbow in front of you. - Okay. One more, one more. Whoa! Whoa! (laughs) It looks awesome! - But I don't know what I'm doing! Like, look at this. I don't know how to, even... - Do it again, do it again. - Okay, okay. I'll watch you. - See from back here. See from back here. - I'm gonna watch you. Okay. So it's like, it's coming in front of you, but you're kind of leading with this elbow and then you... (Star Wars music drowns out voices) - Okay, wait, I think I just did it. (Star Wars music) Woooo! I just did it! I don't know what I did, but I think (indistinct). - Do it again! - I don't know what I did! - Me neither. - I got this. - Lead with the elbow, the elbow! - There! - There you go, yes! (Both exclaim) - Woohoo! I've sliced up everyone's legs and my own. - There's different angles and each angle has a number. - Okay. - Okay, so one, - One - Two - Two - Three - Three - Four - Four - And then a five is a nice thrust - Hah! - to the belly. - Five - Six - Six - Seven - Seven - And eight. - Eight! - And it gets a little confusing, 'cos sometimes- - Yeah! - this can also be a six. - Ooh! - And this can also be a seven. - Ooh! - So it's kind of just those upper cut angles. - Upper, upper. - So now I'm going to come at you with a one and then you can just kind of block it. Like, you know? There you go! - Like this? - Yeah. - Okay. - So you can either do one handed or two handed. - Or two-handed. - Yeah. So as long as it... - Okay. - Yeah. Okay, now you gotta flip to the other side. - Okay. - Okay. We're fighting. (Star Wars music) We're fighting. - We did it! (lightsabers clashing) - Like, you're going to be a Jedi, - Oh yeah? - you know? - This is fun. - And then, - Okay. - I'm gonna teach you a block. You hit me like that, so you- - Oh okay, got it. - Yeah. - So I'm coming in with eight. - So you just want to step off to the side and just kind of do an overhead block. - Okay. - So go ahead and give me another eight. - Okay. - And then you come back. - Ah, got it, got it, got it. - All right, - Okay. - Yeah! - Like that? - But keep it up, keep it up high. - Keep it up? Okay. - You ready? - Yeah. - Now you gotta step off to the side. Yeah! (Rosanna laughs) - Okay. (lightsabers clashing) - Now I'm gonna come in and I'm gonna, I'm gonna- - Okay. give you one of the overhead eights. - All right. - You ready to block it? Yeah! - I love it! - Yeah, you just wanna block that. - Okay. - I'll give you one more. Ready? - One more! - Ready? - Ready! - Oh you blocked me! (Rosanna indistinct) (both laugh) - Okay, I wanna do it to you now, you come to me. - Okay, ready? Okay, you do it to me? - [Both] Okay, okay. - Ready? Okay. - Okay, now I'm coming in, now... (Both shouting excitedly) (Rosanna shouts) (Rosanna laughing) - I'm so slow. - Well, Ro, I think that for your first class, - Yeah? - you did really well. - Thanks Justine, you're a great teacher. - No, I'm not, I'm actually an incredibly terrible teacher. - No, you did really great. You taught me how to do the wrist thing and behind my back thing. - I've got some other tricks. Maybe next time we can do like a passing in the back. - Okay, show me that again. - Some stuff like that. - One more, one more try. - Okay, okay, okay, I think you can do this. - One more, one more. Okay. - So you're just kind of doing your spin and then you're gonna just... - Doing your cool... How the heck did you do that? What are these called? Stunt sabers. - Stunt sabers. Oh gosh, I've stabbed myself. Well guys, thank you so much for watching. Ro, thank you so much for being in this video. - This was so fun! This was amazing! - You are a Jedi. - I loved this. - This was great. - I want to do more of this. - I will get my trainer, (Rosanna gasps) then we'll start doing some Jedi training together. - Okay cool, okay cool! - Make sure you go check out Ro's channel. We did some fun videos over there, so go subscribe and check out her videos and we will see you guys in the next video. So yeah, bye. - Five! - Five. May the force be with you. - Yeah.

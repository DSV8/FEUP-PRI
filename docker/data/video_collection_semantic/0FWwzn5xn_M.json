[ASUS ROG PHONE REVIEW PART 1]  As smartphone designs creep ever closer to total iPhone-like homogenization, any manufacturer that bucks the trend is one that makes me sit up and take notice. So when ASUS announced its crazy ROG Phone at Computex in June, I knew I'd be falling over myself to cover it come release. And that day has finally come.   It's not so much the spec upgrades, like the slightly-speedier Snapdragon processor, that have me stoked for the ROG Phone. It's the fact that ASUS built it for a specific application  gaming  and didn't even think about compromising that vision in pursuit of mass appeal. One look the heavily stylized casing design, replete with copper cooling vents, ultrasonic triggers and a glowing Aura logo, tells you all you need to know about why the ROG Phone exists. That's before you even connect the AeroActive clip-on fan, just one accessory of an entire ecosystem made to guarantee the ROG Phone gives you a mobile gaming experience like no other.   I'll have to use that whole ecosystem before I decide whether the ROG Phone is worth its base price of $899 (especially in light of the fact that its closest competition is $100 cheaper) ... but my early impressions are strong enough that I'm positively giddy about getting the chance to try. Check out Part 1 of my ASUS ROG Phone Review above, and be sure you're so you don't miss Part 2 coming in a few weeks!   [SUBSCRIBE TO MRMOBILE]     [ABOUT MRMOBILE'S ASUS ROG PHONE REVIEW PART 1]  MrMobile's ASUS ROG Phone Review Part 1 was produced following ten days with an ASUS ROG Phone review device provided by ASUS. The device was only tested in a gaming context and entirely in-studio, with no cellular network connection. ROG Phone Review Part 2 will cover those aspects, as well as others (battery life, phone call quality, etc.) omitted from this first look.   Additional footage courtesy Android Central.

    "transcript": "(upbeat music) - I'm gonna level with you. I've never really been into mobile gaming because I've never found mobile games all that engrossing. Well this smartphone right here? I think this was built to change that. (upbeat music) Okay. So this is the Asus ROG Phone. ROG for Republic of Gamers. Now as you YouTube subscribers already know, Asus isn't the only company bringing a gaming smartphone to market in 2018. I went hands on with the ROG Phone's biggest competitor, the Razer Phone 2 a couple weeks ago. The full review is coming soon. It's very impressive. But though these two products are targeting similar consumers, they're doing it very differently. The Razer Phone 2 is a hard-edged, angular monolith. It tries to walk the line between gamer and power user. Well, the ROG Phone is a rounded and super-stylized slate whose aesthetics say one thing. This is a muscle car, and it's made for playing hard. Just look at the copper grills on the vent ports around back, next to the engraved call-out reminding you that for this phone, traditional cooling just won't do. See the Snapdragon 845 running the show, is the same chip you'll find in almost every high-end smartphone of 2018. But this one is capable of running a little faster. Nearly 3 GHz. More work equals more heat. Maybe more than the built in vapor-chamber and heat spreader can deal with. So in the box with the phone (chuckles), you get a fan. Asus calls this the Aero Active Cooler, but it's literally a slap-on fan. It forces air through the phone's casing to cool it better. Yes, you can feel it on your fingers when you're playing and even will blow your hair around if you hold it up to your head like a moron. Of course, there's custom software here. Each game you play on the ROG phone can have it's own profile. So you can set parameters by game. Like what clock speed you want to run at. How fast do you want the fan to run if the cooler's attached. Whether you want to dump everything else out of RAM when you open the game. And what refresh rate you want from the display. This screen maxes out at 90 Hz. Not quite the 120 Hz of the Razer Phone, but it has other advantages. It's an OLED panel instead of an LCD. And it is substantially brighter. (upbeat music) Back to the Aero Active for one second. It plugs into a special side connector that also contains another USB-C port, so you can switch from a portrait game to a landscape one, and continue charging without your grip getting all weird. Oh, and get this. In a world where more and more phones are eliminating the traditional headphone port. The ROG phone? It gives you two between the phone and the fan. If you prefer to give your sound more room to spread out, the Front Firing speakers are incredibly powerful. The power of this package is just amazing. (upbeat music) (upbeat music) But even a casual like me knows that gaming is about more than power, and Asus knows it too. Check out these textured call-outs on the side of the phone. These are called AirTriggers. They're ultrasonic touch sensors that serve as buttons when you're playing your game. Like the bumpers on a console controller. My favorite part about these is that they work with any app. You just drag these circles over whatever on-screen targets you want them to tap. When you click the triggers. Boom! Extra buttons. I love thoughtful touches like these that have an effect on how you use the phone. And I even appreciate 'em when they're just a little bit of shallow fun, like the customizable multi-colored logo on the Back Plate. Now here's why I can't finish this review in just one video folks. I have yet to use the ROG Phone for anything other than gaming. The big 4000mAh powered battery, the dual-camera array with its ultra wide option. I've still gotta put those to the test. And the reason for that? It's not just phonetober fest. It's that I don't think it's possible to review this phone completely without also trying all of its accessories. The accessories are a huge part of this story. And I think most customers who are considering buying this phone will also buy those. Asus tells me I'll be able to check those out in a few weeks. So once again, please subscribe to the YouTube channel so you don't miss part two. I will close on a few of the complaints I've jotted down so far. I'm not quite sure about the look of the custom Asus software. The fingerprint sensor definitely takes some getting used to. And the lack of wireless charging or water resistance beyond IPX4 is kind of a bummer. Minor issues, but at $899, the ROG Phone is 100 bucks more than the direct competition from Razer. A hundred bucks more than the Google Pixel 3. And wouldn't it be easier to save up for that some if you had a, I don't know, financial coach of some kind?

    "transcript": "hello you people who I have a surprise good people look where I'm at what's up guys come to meet it's matx case two systems stay present and now well hello good what's up guys hello good people I'm Dimitri welcome to the case awards of 2018 you know I feel like the case market has redeemed itself this year based on the disappointment that was 2017 I feel like new trends are emerging that I'm excited about and 2019 is looking kind of a mystery like I can see certain things becoming more mainstream and more popular but then a large portion of that remains a mystery so I'm excited now some 27 cases have passed through the studio there's some good options in there my friends some good options the new master liquid ml AI a liquid coolers from Coolermaster come in both 120 and 240 millimeter variants now with addressable RGB LEDs both the fans and the pump that can be controlled via this hub with options to adjust the lighting effects and speed along with the ability to control them through the respective motherboard software check out the ML 120 and ML 240 ra iOS down below as usual the rules are simple the cases must have been released and reviewed by us in 2018 and I make sure to double check all the availability as well because in our last case awards video for 2017 the define r6 won the case of the year yet the holes not yet available until like January so none of that this year alright I hope you enjoy the categories for this case words are my favorite case the best overall value case the most innovative case best water cooling enclosure The WOW collection of features the fan favorites fail compilation and of course we got to conclude with the case of the year oh all right let's begin all right so let's start off with something fun my favorite case of the year came on April 1st this tiny wooden case you construct yourself from cooler master I feel like this should legitimately become a thing from more brands if you're the type of person to collect unique items when it comes to PC building like the detail on a cooler the the motherboard tray is kind of insane and is definitely something any builder will appreciate as my real favorite case of the year this easily goes to the new NZXT H500 so this is a replacement for the s340 that was one of the best selling cases on Amazon and the H500 is a nice compact mid tower that usual NZXT character it's boxy it's full metal frame a very nice tgd mount the interior layout is perfect for most systems whether your air cooling or installing a 240 rad at the front with actually pretty decent air flow to with that side ventilation despite the fully solid front panel I do appreciate the plastic keel magma channels the perforated power supply shroud the old one front IO connector and purple USB ports and for 69 bucks you should definitely consider the NZXT H500 and the only crappy thing is the hard drive cage as it was on the s340 there are no draft carries and therefore can only house 3.5 inch drives moving on to the best value enclosure I feel the P350X from Phanteks deserves the spot at 69 bucks over the NZXT H500 simply because it's likely a longer so you can stall more fans at the top the drive cage is easily accessible from the front with drive caddies it has built-in lighting that actually is quite tasteful the interior has expanded over the p300 granting EATX motherboard support with deeper section at the front for cable management you can install radiators up to 280 millimeters at the front cable management is easy and the only downside is that you cannot install a 360 rather than the front because the shroud is closed the runner-up is the very basic micro ATX frame from Cooler Master the Q300L at $39 now the interior is fully open to support large PSU's and GPUs it's nothing fancy there are no rubber grommets plus the side panel is acrylic but I love the fully perforated exterior so you can have more flexibility on where to mount your fans with these unique looking dust filters steel and even the side that yo can be repositioned and for ITX and micro ATX budget systems the q300L is a must consideration now let's get into the most innovative category I want to give this one to the cooler master SL600m because it is not at all what I was expecting and really a appreciate the different direction with the interior layout so the PSU shroud is relocated to the front opening up this bottom section from massive intake with those 200 millimeter fans that's delivering the best cooling for the GPU you can also rotate that entire PCI bracket for vertical GPUs as long as you get additional riser cables and I feel this case is all about experimentation and needs refinement as vertical air column mean the CPU cooler must face up for proper exhaust or you need to install a 360 rad up top as well I love the illuminated IO the rail system for PSU installation and the exterior design it is kind of risky but I really want to see more like it the runner up is not the case itself because the execution is kind of poor but the concept of Riotoro Morpheus is what I'm more excited about so this case comes disassembled with a few extra pieces to expand the frame height wise in its smaller configuration you can still fit an ATX motherboard but with only 5 PCI slots available so it's perfect for you know single GPU systems while expanding the height is both easy and grants you extra PCI slots for multi-gpu configurations and I want to see more designs that incorporate this type of frame level flexibility perhaps going from smaller ITX to full sized ATX with sliding exterior panels like we see with the Morpheus no for extra spacing for radiators and hardware and I'm really hoping we'll see a derivative of the Morpheus in 2019 moving on to the water cooling category the corsair 1000d is kind of a no-brainer given its massive size and just a frame that's built for multiple radiators thanks to these convenient sliding brackets at the front and the top they are interchangeable so you have the flexibility with the size of radiator so you can install the extra height and length of the case means push-pull really thick radiators is kind of the way to go with a ton of room available beside the motherboards for reservoirs and pump installations so this is kind of your super tower that needs a custom loop for dual systems and the fantastic lay out behind the tray for cable management with these doors but a smaller run route for water cooling is the latest define s2 from fractal design they've always delivered the fantastic experience when it comes to user assembly and hardware support and who doesn't love the simplicity of this exterior there are several minor changes versus defined r6 but without the hard drive cage so the s2 is all about radiators to the front the top and the bottom and the rear to the top bracket has a fill port there are several mounting strips for a reservoir near the front and everyone who has built a custom loop in the fractal enclosure will guarantee an awesome experience this next section is my collection of WoW features the deep good quad stellar is highly impractical difficult to work in has bad cooling but is one of the coolest frame designs from 2018 with this mechanized front flaps for airflow and even an app for RGB control and fan rpm I absolutely love the curved acrylic panel on the view 37 from Thermaltake again this departure from traditional side panels to deliver this wow element is appreciated despite the totally choked front fans and non-existent cable management the end when a one ITX enclosure has several wow factors like the glass top panel with the built-in Qi charger a transparent and RGB illuminated bottom section for extra flare support for normal CPU towers up to 160 millimeters and an included 600 watt power supply with short cables while the street come that too is one of the most elegant ITX enclosures with an innovative mounting system using these universal brackets it's unconventional a bit uncomfortable during assembly but the flexibility on what you can use them for is appreciated who knew you could comfortably fit a second ITX system above your main motherboard inside the Evolve X by Phanteks and then route a riser cable behind the motherboard tray so both systems could have a graphics card it's very cool but it does lock you into the revolt X power supply that can power those both systems and finally the angle GPU bracket on the cosmos c700M is all about show-off vertical alignment is kind of old news so why not try this 45-degree wallet cleanser this even lets you mount it on the side of the motherboard perhaps for proximity to that front intake but the consequence is an extremely ugly system that leads us to the fail compilation of 2018 you know it's very nice to have handles on the cooler master q300P so you can easily carry it into the garbage because those plastic panels one to kill your hardware anyway with no airflow you know what's really nice to have for a full glass enclosure absolutely no cable management system in place whoever designed the level 20 VT has an even lower IQ all I'm asking for is some effort the return of land cool as the budget lineup for Lian Li is great with a nice front panel design but please reinforce your frame so it's not easily bent ditch the molex connector for the RGB controller and promise we'll have a more interesting name for the next release the Lian Li 011 Air had everyone's expectations super high despite not having adequate dimensions for the most popular CPU towers but a larger disappointment came with a dust filter that eats air cooler master please have a team meeting to discuss consistency because the H500m from a feature standpoint is amazing but the user experience is so frustrating with a thousand different panels on the PSU shroud and behind motherwort ray perhaps set on where to put the RGB controller because the H500p Mesh and the H500P have them all in different spots for no reason Corsair with a 500D wins on the word for the most frustrating top fan bracket installation with non captive thumb screws and access only from the interior and no 360 rad support either despite the bracket being the same as the front bracket revert back to your old days please just like you did with the tramp stamp logo I'm actually very happy to fix the side panel installation on the Carbide 275R because it is absolutely absurd to have no caching pegs and use an allen key to tighten four screws while holding a pretty heavy tgd panel hey be quiet I love the silent base 601 in 801 cases but please stop lying to yourself about the front panel airflow because there is none I dropped ten degrees with a front panel removed man I love doing the fail compilation because it's hilarious and really reveals all the crap that's been going on the case industry you know I bring you guys down but then we spike right back up with the case of the year so this one's from my eyes goes to the Lian Li O11 dynamic I feel partially because it revived Lian Li as this competitive brand with the case selling for only $129 while delivering something beautiful and the two side glass design is an opportunity to showcase your hardware without sacrificing cooling as the bottom top and the side areas can all mount triple 120mm fans or dual 140 mils the elevated motherboard tray is a brilliant designed for cable management and this whole dual chamber separation as the O11 dynamic is not much taller or wider than your standard mid tower but because the PSU is rotated behind we have so much more room in this main chamber there is a Type C port the front and do a PSU option if you remove the drive cage and many ways to configure your airflow provided your air cooling or stick with a CPU tower below 155 millimetres all the vents are dust covered I love the slide and mechanism for the side panels and this is just an exciting beginning of dual chamber cases that are not conventional for all the right reasons in the 11 dynamic from nearly deserves our case of the year word for 2018 whew alright so that is this for me I hope you enjoyed this case awards for 2018 I'm excited for 2019 and let me know if you agree with my picks I know there there's some cases that did not pass through my hands but 27 is a lot for our Canadian audience memory Express is a place to go for home business and gaming electronics you can try before you buy especially great for peripherals by visiting one of their stores in Winnipeg Calgary or Greater Vancouver and more with a new Victoria store now open with the same quality of service and product selection they do custom pcs and will beat any Canadian price guaranteed how many trip thanks much for watching we'll see you guys in next video",

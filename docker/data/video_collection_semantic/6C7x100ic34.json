    "transcript": "In front of me I have the (Product)RED iPhone 7. I have already tested the glass display of the iPhone 7 in one of my previous durability tests. The only thing we havnt tested is this deep red coloring. Is it as scratchable as the Jet Black iPhone 7? Or can it handle a little every day life? Lets find out [Intro] One thing I do like about iPhones is that they have an all metal design. It is Heavy and solid. Which is good. [Nails on a chalk board] And it looks like Apple has kept with that same theme on this red version. The top is metal... [Grinding Teeth] The red iPhone 7 still has the plastic antenna lines that curve around the corners. It blends in pretty well with the metal. Even if it doesn't sound as delicious during the scratch test. The sides are metal as well... [Nazgul Screeeching] Its even metal down here where the headphone jack should be. [Babies on an airplane] And for the ultimate perk in quality, the buttons are also metal. [Stubbing your toe] Its a very good feeling phone all round. I approve so far. The anodized coloring on the back SHOULD be pretty resilient as well. We are going to find out. If you were to toss your unprotected cell phone in the same pocket as your keys, The red is just not as good at hiding the marks as the Matte black version that I tested earlier. Most of the marks can rub off, but the faint outline is still there. Its still more scratch resistant than the jet black 7 though. Coins, seem to have the same effect as keys. Its almost as if the keys and coins are rubbing off onto the red. Instead of the red getting damaged. But either way, the marks are permanent. So its probably a good idea to have some kind of protection on your phone. The center apple looks like it is made from polished aluminum. My razor blade can definitely mark it up, but something normal like keys or coins should be just fine. The coin didn't add any marks into the mess. Now Apple. And Product Red, are pretty interesting. [Homework on the weekend] Apple has been partnered with product red for about 10 years now, and by selling the 'Product Red' items in the store, [Slow drivers in the fast lane] ...They've raised more than 130,000,000 dollars for the Global Fund to fight AIDS. [Politics] Thats pretty impressive cuz Apple estimates even just one dollar can provide 3 days worth of lifesaving medicine for someone. Another noticeable contributor to the Global Fund is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. [slow wifi] They've contributed about 1,400,000,000 dollars since 2001. And if you know if Bill Gates is donating to something, its gotta be good. Its great to see two huge organizations contributing to something so impactful and life saving on a global scale. Every penny counts, so thumbs up for Apple and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for contributing. If you are interested in donating to the global fund to fight AIDs but dont want to buy an iPhone. Apple has included a link at the bottom of their website. But all it seems to do at the moment is cycle through to Apples own iTunes store. So Ill include a working link in MY video description of this video where you can contribute directly to the Global Fund, until apple gets that link fixed. Maybe with all of us working together we really can have an Aids free generation. That concludes math time with Jerry. Anker was kind enough to send me out some clear cases to protect my artwork on the phone... Or maybe it was to protect the phone from my artwork... I forget exactly what the letter said. The case is surprisingly clear which means this might be the perfect solution for people who want to show off their Red iPhone without covering anything up. Its a pretty tight and snug fit all the way around the phone. If you want something slightly more structural than just rubber, they also sent an ice-case with a more ridged plastic bumper. It has the same tight fit, but has the bonus protection of the harder plastic ring around the side. And best part of all they are surprisingly inexpensive. Ill toss some links right below this video if you want to check them out. Huge thanks to Anker for sending me the cases. My phone definitely appreciates it. Since I'm sure a few people are curious. I did to a Mohs Test on the back of the aluminum, the level 4 pick behaved the same as the keys and coins, but the level 5 pick was able to scrape off some of the red coating. [automated phone systems] Kind of interesting. Most of my behind the scenes stuff happens on Twitter and Instagram, so follow me over there, and thank you so much for watching! Ill see you around.",

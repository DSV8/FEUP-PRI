    "transcript": "hey,how's it going Dave2D here. so with 2019 rolling in,we're gonna start to see a lot of advertisements for '5G' enabled smartphones and the benefits of the 5G network. and the reality is , a properly rolled out 5G network is great! .You get super fast internet speeds, You get lower latency,you get the ability to connect a lot more devices to that super fast internet. But to get to that stage to get to that point, where it's like the Internet Of Things(IOT). And everything is connected and talking to each other on the super fast network You need to overcome a very large obstacle and this large obstacle kind of casts some shade on this whole 5G smartphone thing it's the difference in 5G wavelength.A 5G signal act very differently from the traditional lower frequency 4G wavelength,5G signals have significantly shorter range and weaker penetration than 4G signals. so,things like walls those obviously affect the way that 5G signals get through. But even it's something like a tree or an object or another human being between you and a 5G cell tower will affect the signal strength,even the way you hold your phone.If this was a 5G enabled phone, if your hand is covering the antenna it will attenuate the signal.even stuff like weather, effects like rain,fog ,snow that can reduce the signal strength of 5G frequencies, so the solution to this, the work around to this problem is kind of primitive,they're basically flooding cities that are gonna be 5G enabled with a ton of cell towers. so basically ,this is not an exaggeration where an ideal situation where you want cell towers in basically every little street lamp that's a ton of 'em and in an office building they're gonna be everywhere because you need to have as clear of a line of sight between your phone and a signal and a signal tower to be able to use the 5G network properly.now, the problem with that is well, in terms of the network side is it's very difficult and very slow to build up an infrastructure like that. Like all the permits,all the requirements to get stuff like that done, plus there's push back from communities not everyone want's to be like surrounded by these cell towers and there's the issues of like health risks like there's not a lot of long-term studies of EMF radiations from these new towers.so for early adopter's ,it'll be a long time before 5G enabled phones can actually take advantage of real 5G-connectivity that's just the nature of this roll-out,it's not an easy roll-out and that's just the network side of things . when it comes to phone hardware,there are whole slew of other obstacles. 5G enabled phones are gonna be crazy expensive at launch!.so,Pete Lau (CEO of One Plus) . he was saying that their 5G enabled phones are gonna cost $200 - $300 more than their regular 4G phones. And this is like a $550-$600 phone,you throw on that 5G tax this is now a $800 or $900 phone. this used to be a very reasonable, kind of not \"budget phone\", but it's like a fairly priced phone. And now, it's like in that crazy price point because of 5G capabilities . That new Snapdragon 855 needs a separate 5G modem and multiple antenna modules to make this work on the 5G network and the reason why you need so many antenna modules is because of the problem i was mentioning before , if you're hands cover any of the antennas it doesn't work you need to have multiple antennas ,that it intelligently switches between to allow this thing to connect seamlessly with the network. It's difficult to do,it's expensive to do and it's gonna cost the consumer a lot.there's also the issue of shorter battery life so because you're transmitting and receiving 5G signals ,it's gonna invariably use more power than the regular 4G version , it's I mean you're gonna get betters speeds,of course it's the new network. But, again the whole premise of 5G promises something like 10 times or 20 times the speed of 4G which in theory sounds great and maybe, in the future will get there.But, in the beginning when it first rolls out we're gonna get like that snapdragon 855 on there, forget the name of it .but the modem, that 5G modem can only hit, i think? two and a half times what the 4G network can hit .So again it's faster but it's not gonna be 10x or 20x it's gonna be quite a few years before we hit those speeds and it's not like i'm taking a dump on 5G, I feel like the technology's awesome and whenever,we get there. This video is more for the people that are interested in being early adopters for 5G smartphones . The technology sounds awesome! and they're gonna advertise those phones quite well. And you're gonna be tempted.My point is in this current world of what we live in 5G enabled networks are gonna be rolled out very slowly.So, if you're gonna spend your money,like unless you're just jonesing for that 5G experience .it\"S gonna be a huge premium for something that won't be an amazing experience , because it can't be this early on . it's gonna get there .this is the groundwork for it . But, right now I would just hold off on 5G enabled smartphones .Because that's just the reality. it's not gonna be that good at launch .Okay,hope you guys enjoyed the video .thumbs if you like it,subs if you loved it. see you guys next time CAPTIONS BY: poolkoodhi",

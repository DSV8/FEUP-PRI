    "description": "Dave2D review of the Microsoft Surface Go. This is the best 2 in 1 laptop from Microsoft for students on a tighter budget. On Sale Here -   This 2in1 tablet/laptop is incredibly small and has a ton of potential for people who need an ultra portable device that can be used as a comfortable tablet as well as a very functional laptop. This is great for developers, students, work or even for media consumption as a secondary device.

    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going Dave 2d here? This is a Microsoft Surface go and when they first announced it I was interested in it It seemed like a pretty compelling device having used it for a little while I really think this is seriously the best product that Microsoft has put out in a very long time this thing starts at $400 I don't think that base configuration is where you want to spend the money though. They have a mid tier one 550 quite a bit more but you're getting double the RAM double the storage but significantly faster storage That is the model that I think most people should pick up if you can afford that price bump so this unit here, is that mid tier model the $550 unit and I Really like it. Ok, let's go around. This thing build quality is great. It's a surface product It has a magnesium enclosure fit and finish on this is really well done the Top surface has these new rounded edges and it actually makes the device a lot more comfortable to hold Not that the original surface products are like uncomfortable But this small detail just makes it that much more ergonomic and that much more inviting to use It's a nice touch and I think Microsoft should put this kind of Rounded edge on all of their products because it does make a difference. The screen is a 10 inch screen I thought I'd be a little bit small for what I do But it actually isn't it is noticeably smaller compared to like a 12 or 13 inch screen, but it doesn't feel particularly cramped It's still a very usable surface area the bezels around that screen though are thick now visually It's not attractive right having thick bezels. Like this doesn't look good But when you're actually using it, you won't notice it you'll be focused on your content it's just that when this devices off or it's just sitting there and you're kind of examining it visually the bezels are thick the panel itself is nice its sharp great colors and brightness and Hitting a price point like this with this kind of screen It could not have been easy. Like we see four or five hundred dollar devices out there that have terrible screens This thing looks really good. There is pen support as usual and feels relatively lag free to me I'm not an artist But the surface area feels reasonably sized for people that want to use it for any kind of digital creative work Now on the side are two speakers and they sound really good for this kind of device size nice body to the sound Excellent stereo separation just from the positioning and you just get really clean audio that gets to a decent volume You also get a killer killer webcam $400 gets your webcam of this quality it's actually one of the best kans I've seen on any laptop period but when you compare This webcam to something like a 12-inch MacBook. It just blows my mind I mean if you can stick a webcam like this into a $400 device, there's no excuse for other people They should be using really good webcams and no one else is doing it, but surface does so good for them this device though is not complete without the keyboard and the keyboard is a Hundred bucks, which is crazy expensive you think about it. That's like at the base model. That's 20% of the cost, but That's what we have. Okay, when it's connected up and it connects magnetically. It is an awesome. Awesome productivity device So I was concerned that this keyboard would be really small and cramped and just kind of weird feeling because it is a lot smaller Than the regular service devices. It's not cramped. It's excellent. It does take a little bit of time to get used to it But it is a really comfortable keyboard the trackpad feels good. It's a surface product So tracking is accurate and gestures work nicely. But the pad is a little small. Maybe it's a visual thing I just wish there's a little bit more surface area to this trackpad. Okay performance on this device is Good, it's not amazing. It's a Pentium Gold chip and most productivity stuff Like emails web browsing or any kind of work-related stuff runs really smoothly on this So the drive feeds on the mid-tier model actually really good fast read speed but on the slower drive of the base model the whole System is gonna feel a bit more sluggish and that reason alone makes it worth it to upgrade to the mid-tier model Battery life is also pretty good getting around seven hours of battery life and to charge it You can either use the included surface connect adapter or you can use the USB C port I really wish that the included adapter was USB C but its surface connect because well, that's Microsoft's for you Okay gaming performance. I was actually surprised by this You're not gonna be able to play some killer triple-a titles But light games are pretty good on this thing if you want to pick it up for some casual light games It'll do the trick now The surface go is still a surface product through and through so if they're issues you had with surface products in the past You may have those same issues with this one. Like if you need more ports, there's still only one port It's use BC this year But it's still only one port if you don't like the kickstand on your lap Like it's not an ideal situation for lap use, but it does work reasonably Well plus infinite positions up to a certain degree, but I don't know This makes it fairly usable for most people I think but if you've had issues in the past same issues now Overall though really good product. I think for students This is such a good option you get so much versatility on this thing You get a great keyboard for taking notes You can pull up course material and stuff in class Good option great for me to consumption for like a secondary device if you want it for that I think you can't go wrong with this it is however not Cheap once you add everything up together like the keyboard and like the mid tier unit It's not the $400 device that they're kind of marketing So you kind of have to take that into consideration, but overall I like this thing. Ok. Hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs We liked it subs we loved it. See you guys next time",

    "transcript": "- Alright, so they were looking for somebody to do this video, and they picked me. Why? Cause I like to sit down, okay? And I like to game, and that's why we're unboxing the COUGAR Gaming Ranger Gaming Sofa. We're just gonna dive into this thing. (tape ripping) Here's probably what I'm looking for. That's probably the feet. There's a lumbar pillow. There ya go! That's your gaming sofa. Assembly drawings, cool! So they make it actually, pretty simple to put together. So we've got the top portion that we need to connect to the base. Before I was a PC gamer, I was a console gamer. So I used to sit down a lot. (metal pieces clank) Oh, so, yeah, these are the feet. Honestly, this thing is pretty heavy, but like it's not unwieldy for one person to move around. So, slides right on apparently. It seems like these brackets were like a little bit bent when I was putting this on but. Gaming! So this is actually pretty cool, like, this is all tool-less right? So these just fit in right with these notches, and it just slides right in. And that's pretty much it honestly. Slide it in! Oh! That one made a click, the other one didn't click. I'm pulling on it and nothing's happening. I'm feeling more gamer already with this orange, these orange accents. So right now I'm just putting on the front supports. And then I'm gonna put on the back ones, which actually require a little bit more work. This is so it keeps your butt cool, you know? So what, this is taking, what, 5 minutes maybe to put together? That's not bad at all. Yeah, honestly, I think this thing looks sick. It's not gonna match everybody's living rooms unless you've got like a Linus Tech themed living room, but if you have like a home theater, you had a few of these set up. Right now you could pick them up for, like I think it's like $399 USD, which is like, ya know, it's, it's a chunk of change, but realistically, if you're looking to buy a recliner new (hums noncommittally) A little bit more gamer, a little bit more gaming focus here, okay? So, this is also just the orange COUGAR Gaming Ranger Sofa. They actually have a few other color variances as well. They've got blue, green... No, you can't sit until we do the sponsor brief. I have to do the sponsor brief. - [Linus] Well hurry up, I wanna try it. - Private internet access. Private Internet Access VPN. Access services or websites as though you are in a different country. It encrypts all of your Internet traffic and uses a safe protected IP. You can connect up to 10 devices at once. PIA helps you hide your true IP address, so you can bypass sheer restrictions and censorship, and it includes an internet kill-switch if your VPN gets disconnected involuntarily. PIA is available for Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, even as a Chrome extension, so check it out. Try PIA risk-free with a 30 day money back guarantee at the link below. So Linus just ran in here and he just put a hole in the sofa. - You can't get within 2 meters, go! - What, well what are you doing? - Just look at it from there. - Whoa... - Did you assemble this right? - Ya, I thought so. - It lifts up the legs when you lean back. - Ya, that's a feature. Okay, so does it feel secure at all when you're doing that? So the default sitting position is 95 degrees. - It's not enough support. They are a German company, right? - [Cooper] Cougar Gaming? - Ya. - [Cooper] Unsure. - Yeah, Germans are taller than us. Look at my feet. - [Cooper] It's cause we're short. He can't even touch the ground. - Oh, cushion on the butt. - How do you feel? - It doesn't really line up, like this is kinda not lining up with my neck very well. - Oh ya, it's not adjustable. - You know how something feels fine at first, but then after like an hour, it hurts? - Ya. - I feel like my elbows might actually feel pressure pointy. - If you're gaming or something too? - If I was here for a couple hours, this, there's not a lot of padding here. This is like - [Cooper] Ya, it's definitely tough - [Man] Do you see that? I'm bottoming out pretty quick, whereas the ass - You're sinking, you're in! - That's pretty - You're in! - That's pretty plushy. Oh, and it's kind of continuous, I can go... here - Yup, and you can keep going. - I can go here. - You can go all the way. - But you can go anywhere in between. That's kind of cool, well... (exclaims) (yells) (laughing hysterically) So this chair is made from PVC leather, which I assume they picked to be more durable than PU, but don't sit on it with your screwdriver. That's probably a smart move. (satisfied groan) Okay! Ya, I think you're right, like you really do sink into it. Your butt feels good, but like, it's not exactly the most comfortable thing in the world. It tilts all the way to 160 degree point. Couch gaming, this is pretty decent from here to the TV there. Can your sofa do this? (grunts) Little piece of wood, not a big deal. Don't run into the back of the sofa, you're gonna be okay. So and then, there's no way to actually kick out this without tilting back, which is, I don't know how I feel about that. So the recliner that I have at home, you can actually adjust the feet without necessarily adjusting the back, but in order for the back to go up, your feet have to go down. So my first test is gonna be the way I use my recliner at home, Switch Gaming. (sofa creaks) So it does rock a little bit. I mean right now I have absolutely no arm support, which is fine. This is like what happens if I play Switch in bed. So I understand when Linus is coming from when he says that his feet can't touch the ground. Me and him are about the same size, I'm 5'6\". But I will say when you're actually reclined back, even just a bit, it's actually pretty comfortable. And the fact that you've actually got support all the way down your body too, like it's not like there's a gap here. I think my recliner actually has a gap, and then I've got my foot rest down a little bit. So here is not supported at all. At least this way, like, I would say this is, it's not a bad gaming experience. But what if you don't wanna game with your Switch or a controller? You wanna use a good old mouse and keyboard? Well, let's check that out. So how is the lap board actually on the arm rest? - So the lap board right now is against the arm rest, but it's also supported on my knees. - Okay. - It's not bad. Ya I have to keep my toes pointy. - [Man] That's gonna hurt your calves and your legs. - [Cooper] Ya, that's gonna be uncomfortable after a little bit. - There's no cup holder. - Oh, well. - Lttstore.com I don't want to say I'm skinnier than David, but I just might be a little bit smaller than David, and even still. - [Linus] Less muscular - Excuse me, I'm pretty muscular. So if I take out the lumbar pillow, and I slide all the way back, bam! My knees are not supporting this right now, it's good. I mean the lap board's one thing, but I will say at least with the flat arm rest at this angle, it is easy to have a lap board if you can support it. So this isn't bad. My feet feel good. I feel supported. This is moved back a little bit, so currently resting on top of my knee, but the only problem is that it keeps wanting to slide back, and if I go any further back, I literally can't see anything. Ya, I mean if you have your own gaming room, and you wanna put this in, and you've got like a home theater set up, and you're couch gaming all the time, maybe you could get away with this. If you're just gonna casually buy one of these and just like slip it by your significant other? You know, I don't know if it's gonna fly. I don't know. But, um, ya. So guys, that about does it. Thank you very much for watching. Make sure to hit the Like button, Subscribe if you wanna see more gaming stuff, and we'll catch you on the next one. (screams)",

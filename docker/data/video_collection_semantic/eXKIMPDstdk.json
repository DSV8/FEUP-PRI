    "transcript": "this is by far the cheapest all-in-one computer I could find at Best Buy it was like half the price of the year up and in today's video we're gonna do some horrendous gaming on it the performance mode is trying real hard to get fortnite running on this system but first today's video is sponsored by the Lexar NM 790 now available in up to four terabytes so you can cram it full of as many anime dating Sims as you can imagine you weirdo it may be d-ramless but it doesn't stop it from blazing speeds making it a fast and affordable way to add a whole bunch of nvme storage to your system and it's compatible with the PS5 making it nice and versatile if that sounds good to you check out the link in the video description thank you lexor for sponsoring today's video thank you [Music] now for those of you that don't know an all-in-one computer is basically just a monitor with some Chromebook Hardware glued to the back of it you can think of it like a Kirkland brand iMac you know the kind of thing you buy for your grandmother so they can spend eight hours a day playing Solitaire on it and getting scammed on the internet but in today's video we're gonna see what else granny can play on it foreign I think this may also count as a full gaming setup because of the E-Waste peripherals oh it's a Lenovo essential keyboard and mouse combo gen 2. [Music] oh the keyboard's got like a mouse scrotum although excitingly the mouse testicle seems to be Wireless fancy whoa I think this is going to be my new main gaming mouse it looks like a beast Jokes Aside it is awesome that it comes with batteries although on the flip side it means it's not rechargeable which is a lot less awesome I feel like that is some very necessary plastic use why couldn't they just package it like that some more plastic very nice oh it's so nice of them to include instructions on how to put batteries in the peripherals for all of the grannies that are gonna buy these oh yeah that is a beast just add some stranger grease and it'll feel like you're at your local library it uses an external power brick that's so annoying although it is 90 Watts so this system clearly isn't messing around foreign oh it's so cute it does really look like a system your granny would buy it's even got like a little storage pouch here for knitting needles it's got this little pop-up webcam thing so that it's you know your granny can hide her identity while she's being scammed on the Internet it's low enough that there's no way for you to ergonomically interact with it that's very on brand it's actually got a good range of movement so you can comfortably look down at it it's quite a sturdy thing shaking the table and there's not much like not much display wobble which is pretty cool turn it around wow it's actually really heavy considering how small it is around the back it's nice and stylish you can see we've just got this single like metal strut that keeps the display up we've got some usable i o on the back here is a sticker that gives us a hint that is the power of this system that feels like it wants to come off but at the same time it really doesn't I then spent an embarrassing amount of time trying to pry the flap off but we got there eventually oh there we go what this is is that the higher end model has like a like a DVD drive in here so this just covers up the empty space for that you may actually be able to buy it as an add-on accessory later or see on lenovo's website if that is in fact the case but with that let's set it up turn it on and see what kind of Hardware granny is packing [Music] oh that's kind of like floppily attached like that wow that just pops open like that I've already noticed my favorite thing in the world we've got McAfee just pinned to the taskbar down here let's see what other VD granny has to deal with yeah that's kind of it in terms of CPU we've got a Pentium 7505 a dual core 4 threat Powerhouse which I'm very curious to see how it performs the igp you were gaming with just says UHD Graphics which is a great sign oh it's got a touch screen I just noticed that I was gonna like sarcastically point at the Intel UHD Graphics but that's pretty cool oh and finally we've got a single eight gig stick of 3200 megahertz Ram now the fact that that's one of two does imply that the ram is upgradable so after I do the first round of gaming tests I will try and break the back off and then see how easy it is to upgrade the Ram configuration but for now let's try and play some games whoa this display is surprisingly good it looks nice oh Pentium you spoilers with 30 frames per second that has dipped down to the 20s once we go outside oh oh it looks so terrible is this really running at MVP it's so pixelated I I guess GTA 5 really needs the bit of anti-aliasing wow it's been a while since I've done this drive in GTA 5. it's not going great we're hovering just above 24 frames per second which in all fairness we don't need more than that you know the I can't seem oh oh yeah it's this kind of GTA 5 experience oh yeah this is this is going very well at least the fact that the floor isn't rendering does give us quite a frame rate boost oh yeah there's just buildings popping in and out of existence that doesn't break immersion at all cool things are staying in place and we're almost getting 40 frames per second I don't know for granny gaming this is pretty impressive in this new 70 year old game and it also does my favorite thing where the igpu is bottlenecked by the CPU it's attached to now as we all know Granny's love fortnite so I'm gonna give this a bit of a try I'm gonna use performance mode because it apparently is meant for it to run on potatoes like this so let's see what kind of performance we get with this damn this is some Next Level fortnite going on here oh there's there's a player here [Music] no way oh my God I actually lost yeah not meaning to bully children but I feel like that that person needs to uninstall fortnite and after that brief distraction I turned my toxicity back to the granny system the performance mode is trying real hard to get fortnite running on this system and it's not even because of the UHD Graphics I've never seen an igpu bottleneck this hard [Music] new it looks like granny is gonna have a tough time pawning noobs in CS go at least the 1080p oh yes that feels way better can you oh no that doesn't work oh no never mind okay gone came with the touchscreen ew it does look like DOTA isn't quite on the menu for granny this is 1080p low settings but with like 50 render resolution so it looks like garbage and it's not actually running at 1080p now this was a bot match and because of the CPU situation I'm sure a real game of DOTA would perform better but I wasn't willing to grieve a game with actual people in it using this system so I decided to move on to something a bit more demanding [Music] now when it comes to Battlefield 5 it's 720p low settings aside from again highlighting that hilarious CPU bottleneck but it's I was gonna say not too bad but 30 frames per second is not playable in Battlefield 5. but maybe we could do something about it let's drop the resolution scale to 25 at 720p and see what happens well aside from it looking like the game's being censored it's not made a huge difference to the frame rate because well we were a CPU bottleneck anyway I learned very optimistically trying to play some cyberpunk which went well okay never mind that's not a thing that's gonna happen so I guess now we get to tear this bad boy open and see how we can upgrade it [Music] foreign I think this slot on the bottom of the display is maybe where we add more RAM which was some real wishful thinking on my part because obviously it wasn't going to be that easy oh oh it's just like a hot swappable storage Mount useful but not what we're looking for also I don't see a way to get deeper into the system through that hole so I guess we're gonna have to start looking under things like this hey there we go there's a screw oh that just like popped the whole world out which is where I ran into a bit of a roadblock nothing else I did led to more of the world popping out and after ages of struggling I ended up on lenovo's website where they have video guides about how to tear down their products which is pretty cool so according to Lenovo you have to kind of pry this bit off oh yeah there you go yes and then with this you can remove the stand but once I got the standoff was when the real brutality started ah the novo video of a different model you like really have to go to town on the base of it to get it open like that that man is is doing some terrible things to that [Music] oh this is the display I'm definitely breaking salmon here it really does not feel like this is meant to open up there we go oh I don't I don't think I was meant to do that oh [Music] that was the worst opening I think I've ever had to do on a device traumatized I examined the system for irreparable damage and then unscrewed the back to see what kind of upgrading we could do and then this should just oh oh we're finally inside now aside from the fact that you essentially have to break apart space time to get in here it's surprisingly upgradable in here you can replace the Wi-Fi card you can upgrade the m.2 storage granny can even upgrade the laptop Ram it uses once she destroys it open are cute little celerons under here with one huge heat pipe that runs to a pretty substantial bit of heatsink up here with a big blower fan it's a reasonably neat solution they just need to make it way easier to get inside with that let's drop some more RAM in here cool so now that we've upgraded the grannytron we just have to break it back together and then see how much more gaming performance we got [Music] now I also asked Anna to go out and buy the granniest mouse pad she could find and funnily enough I'm pretty sure this is the exact mousepad My grandmother used for years and with that addition it's finally time to experience the granny gaming setup in its full power oh I did do a bit of damage to the display look at that but on the bright side the ram is running at its full 3200 megahertz which is good whoa GTA 5 is running a lot better with the 16 gigs of RAM you can see that it's immediately used a lot more than it had available uh initially and it feels better I mean granted this is still 720p low settings so it's not an impressive result but it's better oh wait let's see if it works with 1080p now oh yeah no it's it's still okay no it's still doing that on the bright side the built-in Benchmark went from this at 720p low settings what is happening five minutes later I'm literally never seen that happen actually running so that's a lot better hey look at 720p CS go running like a beast it's a bit stuttery but we are getting not quite 100 frames per second depending on where we're looking whoa fortnite is doing way better look at that we can I mean I was about to say we can see individual leaves but it is still very Blobby I mean there you have it all granny needs to do to get a reasonable 1080p fortnite experience is Savage the back of her device and put some new Ram in it which seems very reasonable to me interestingly this granny gaming setup did cost very similar to the gaming setup in the previous video but performed quite a lot worse so there is that if you missed that video a suggestion for it will pop up in a second other than that thank you for watching and until the next video bye-bye [Music]",

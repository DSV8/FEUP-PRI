    "transcript": "for as long as I can remember if you were a bit strapped for cash but still wanted to get into PC gaming The Meta was to go into an alley and fight some raccoons for an old office PC like this one drop a graphics card into that bad boy and just like that you'd be ready to go onto the internet and yell profanity at strangers in your favorite video game but there's a pretty big problem with these old Alleyway office piecs they're all from the Intel quad core Dark Ages which means they don't have a viable CPU upgrade Beyond just the fastest quad core that happens to go in that socket and those old quad cores are getting pretty long in the tooth so I thought it would be interesting to preempt the gaming office PC meta by about 6 years and bought a brand new office PC for us to [Music] gamify [Music] oh it's so cute innocent and little but don't worry little guy one day you'll also be worth nothing more than a rushed hand job and a couple 20s now the tiny little office pce is a brand new ironically named Dell Inspirion more like where did I go so wrong in my life that I own one of these Aon am I right which has 13th gen Intel inside now don't get too excited this specific version is the cheapest one that has an Intel I3 13100 in it which is still very much a quad core CPU which is the whole point of this video but don't worry I did get an upgrade CPU we can drop in later down the line now this spec has a lot of other issues with it like it's just got a disgusting single 8 gig stick of ram in it and a tiny SSD but those are all things we can potentially upgrade in terms of IO nothing fancy but we do get some pretty fast USB B which is nice yeah this system is very much just computer uh on that note let's see how computer handles gaming before the gamification before we start gaming I just need to do the most important thing which is delete maffy oh I I thought things were going well and then I touched the mouse and things clearly weren't going well yeah I was kind of expecting slightly less abominable performance from a newer Intel igpu granted this is 1080p normal settings in GTA 5 and it is an Intel I GPU with its toes being crushed by single Channel Ram so I guess it was just stupid of me to expect more from it when it comes to other games Battlefield 5 Flatout refused to associate with the depressor on Cyber Punk ran like it was recovering from a recent and particularly brutal colonoscopy and fortnite could have been worse so now that we've established the mindblowing fact that this budget office PC with no graphics card in it struggled to do gaming let's let's see how much potential there is to extract from this system once someone finds it in a dumpster 7 years from now ooh it's captive very nice whoa if I was shown a picture of this interior with no context I would have assumed it's 8 years old the internals of this system hasn't changed at all this is the little Inspirion that I just bought whereas this this is a Dell Optiplex from 2011 is and aside from like the blower cooler is supposed to not blower cooler they do look remarkably similar although the main difference that matters to us is that with this system CPU wise were maxing out at a quad core 8 thread CPU whereas with this system we can drop a 3900k in here theoretically of course although in one key area the new depressor on is markably worse where the old Optiplex has a 240 W power supply in it not a whole lot but enough for a reasonable graphics card upgrade the new depressor on has to make do with a frankly anemic 180 Watts so yeah upgrading may get interesting oh and I just noticed that the full-sized pcie slots at the bottom so we're not going to be able to add a dual slot Graphics got in here which is pretty annoying now because of the design constraints which I personally feel like can only be reasonably rectified through corporal punishment this RX 6400 is the most powerful graphics card I can just slot into this system which is a bummer I didn't want to use this cuz I really hope that 6 years from now this isn't the kind of low profile graphics card performance we're looking at uh but we'll start there uh it kind of looks like I need to pop the front off so that comes out a little tray for some extra Boomer storage there's a screw [Music] here oh yeah okay there we go oh this model actually doesn't have a functional DVD drive in it you have to buy that as an optional extra which is pretty funny but anyway under here we have access to our m.2 storage so we can drop a full-sized m.2 in here that's our Wi-Fi card luckily that stuff isn't soldered down I think the only reason they're not is because that would require Delta redesign stuff wow that is some lowest bitter looking Ram right there which I'll be replacing with this 32 gig kit that Patriot very kindly sent over because this is a JC kit which means we'll probably get that 3200 MHz speed even if we can't change any settings in the Bios oh oh yeah there we go that's exciting okay at the same settings as the igpu we're running into those fun high frame rate GTA 5 engine stutters so a lot more performance although GTA 5 does still seem unhappy with the fact that we are running a quadcore in here which we'll address later on Battlefield 5 was not only running it was running very well at 1080p medium settings cyber Punk also recovered from its colonoscopy and fortnite was way better yeah fortnite is very playable with these low settings although it does seem like the little I3 is becoming a bit of an issue performance-wise which makes sense High frame rates bullying CPUs and all that what I found fascinating was according to cinebench R20 the I3 in this depressor on is faster than a 7700k which was the big coone of the Intel Dark Ages quad cores and then finally for this configuration when it comes to a demanding modern game at 1080p low settings The Last of Us doesn't feel great yeah out here it feels like the systems had a little bit too much tequila and Red Bull to drink although we do have some FSR we can try quality FSR yeah that's better now it bottoms out at 30 frames per second and it feels a little bit less sluggish that's cool and like I said before this is not the configuration I wanted to test because I I I'm really hoping that 6 years from now we're not dropping RX 6400s into systems like this so I want to try the alpha Chad low profile graphics card available today which is this RTX 4060 but first we're going to have to work around some limitations in our depressor on now the first problem we need to deal with is overcoming this system's limitations in the girth accommodation Department I'm just going to use one of these to move the graphics sad out of the case but now when it comes to powering this graphics card that's where things are going to start getting really dodgy not just because we only have 180 W power supply in here which I don't think is going to be able to keep up with this graphics card but we also have to provide the 4060 with a supplemental 8 Pin power connector which again this power supply doesn't have in fact the only supplemental power we have available in here is a single sa power connector that plugs into the motherboard with that connector anyway the reason this is potentially catastrophic is because any 8 supplemental power adapter thing worth its salt has two of these connectors so I'm going to have to use one of these adapters which I've used before on the channel and is always a very good idea yeah I'd say this is a very reasonable way to use our little depressor on o it's a little bit stuttery but nothing's exploded yet which is really exciting according to MSI After Burner we're drawing about as much power as we're going to get from this PO Supply but for now it's hanging in there with Battlefield 5 at 1080p ultra settings we're getting a lot of performance with this system especially considering that we still have the quad core I3 in here we still have a lot of Headroom left in this socket well maybe not power supply wise I think when we drop the I5 in here things may explode but we'll see in a second with cyberp Punk we had some interesting results in the canned benchmarks when you go outside the CPU has a sudden onset seizure and you get a huge drop in performance which didn't happen in the normal game for some reason the Last of Us didn't seem to mind the I3 and ran like a champ and finally fortnite again because of those High frame rates was really choking out the little I3 which I guess means it's time to drop in the six Core i5 13400 which I don't think is too crazy to expect to work considering that you can spec it on Dell's website but that is without the 4060 in the system oh oh this H yeah okay we're there we go Hey look it's everybody's favorite cooler the little dumpster [Music] special interestingly with Battlefield 5 we barely got any more performance with the I5 aside from some small 1% low improvements which could be because the CPU couldn't really draw any more power than the I3 and with cyber Punk we were still getting the seizures so now that we very much run into the limits of that power supply before we go really crazy with it I do want to see what happens if we power that RTX 460 off an external power supply maybe that'll give us more performance I'm curious and I also bought a replacement Riser cable for the one I was using cuz that one's a loser old pcie gen 3 whereas this is pcie Gen 4 which may also help give us a bit more performance and just like that we have everything set up to potentially get the maximum performance possible out of this configuration we've got our fancy new extension cable we have some more power coming in from not a loser power supply yeah I'm curious to see let's see what it does a few moments later wow that very much did nothing uh which I guess means it's time for us to finally get stupid with [Music] it [Music] I'm sure this is exactly what D had in mind when designing the little depressor on CPU wise we have an I9 13900 KF in here to demonstrate the full power of this platform and then we had to add some slightly beefier cooling to it because you know it's a big ass CPU I also put this fan over here just to help cool the power delivery and stuff cuz it does have quite a bit more to deal with and there is an additional CPU 4 pin power which means we can offload some of the very high power draw of this 33900 KF onto this power supply over here but what I'm the most excited about is this Sakura Wu card that yon sent over for a video it is an RX 7800 XT and it is magnificent it even smells very nice there's like a bit of perfume on it which means that my whole office now smells of Sakura which yeah is not a bad thing and that's also going to be majority powered by the external power supply I really tried to offload as much work as possible from this 180 W power supply that comes in the system but with that let's fire it up and see what kind of performance we [Applause] get [Music] wait a minute the CPU is still just drawing like 70 Watts which is way less than the TDP of the 3900k that's not a problem I was anticipating so I downloaded Intel's XTU to try and get the motherboard to loosen up a bit that is a little bit better but despite me setting the power limits in XTU to 220 wats the motherboard doesn't seem to want to give it more than 100 Watts which isn't even the base TDP of the 3900 KF so that CPU isn't being allowed to stretch its legs in the way that it want to I mean this is a CPU that likes to draw well over 200 Watts underload so there really isn't much of a point dropping an I9 into this system even if it does technically support it having said that we did get a jump in performance but not nearly as much as we would have liked cyber Punk did run a decent bit better partially due to the lack of seizures in the baked in Benchmark and due to the GPU boundness of cyberpunk ooh in The Last of Us with 1080p ultra settings we're getting over 100 frames per second and look at how smooth that frame time graph is this game doesn't seem too phased by the fact that that Intel CPU isn't getting that much power sent to it uh which makes sense considering that we're not pumping out super high frame rates so at the end of the day 7 years from now if you find one of these Inspirion in a dumpster don't drop a used I9 into it you're very much not going to utilize that CPU but at least you will be getting better performance than you'd get from a dumpster PC today so you know a bit of progress it's good and it brings me to the end of the video If you enjoyed it subscribe to the channel for a 53% higher chance of finding a dumpster Optiplex and until the next video bye-bye [Music]",

    "transcript": "- So you've got a triple monitor setup. Sweet, right? I had one of those back in Newfoundland, three Dell U2711s. It was a great experience, but... the bezels were kind of harsh. And in this case, these PG25s I believe they are? I'll go with PG25. The bezels are pretty decent, but they're still there. So like, it's about the size of a desktop icon, the way things are right now at 10 ADP. Well, ASUS clearly thought of that and they brought out this-- the ROG Bezel Free Kit. Frankly, when this was first announced, I thought it might be a joke. Like, just look at this picture on the back here. Three monitors that are completely seamless, and in the middle, there's actually information being displayed that you shouldn't be able to see. Is that possible in any way, shape, or form? PIA is a virtual private network that encrypts all of your internet traffic and uses a safe protected IP. You can connect up to five devices at once with Windows, Mac OS, Android, iOS, and Linux clients available, and it has an internet kill switch which keeps you in control of your connection. Try risk free with their 30 day money back guarantee at the link below. ROG Bezel Free Kit, an awesome solution for surrounded multi-monitor setup. It hides bezels behind an optical camouflage, fits size of up to 27-inch monitor with slim bezel, super narrow type, or four side frameless type. Four-side frameless... (clears throat) Okay, there's a little bit of Engrish going on here, but that's okay. Okay, so these are clearly the brackets that we're talking about, and underneath that are these, I guess kind of light pipey lenses. I'm not sure if you can really make that out from there, but we'll have it out of the box soon. It's always a good sign when there's only one page single sided of instructions. Looks like they want actual, like, angles. That may be a slight problem, but I'm sure I can figure it out. Please use this cue card as an aid to stabilize the initial angle pinpoint, which will facilitate further fine tuning. So they want they want it like that? That doesn't seem right at all. But that's not what the material says. Like, if you look at the website here, they're just basically side by side. Like, this is more of that surrounded-- This is kind of what they're talking about in the manual. And with this, I think, with really kind of extreme angles. Oh, look at that. It actually shows you which monitor the lens is supposed to be for. So this is for the left side. I'm guessing since the lettering is right-side up this way, I insert it there. That's a thing. As you get close to this, like that's pretty weird. There's a bit of a gap where the where the bezel would be. So I guess the idea is that when you're playing a game, your focus is primarily going to be in the center of the screen. It's kind of the same thing as what variable rate shading does in DirectX12 and more modern titles. So with your focus in the middle of the screen, your peripheral vision is everything else, so these might not be that weird-looking in game. So I see what they mean about needing finer adjustments. Getting it lined up just right is a little bit tricky. But when you do, yeah, I need that, the Windows desktop looks pretty bad the way things are right now. You are giving up a little bit of screen real estate. But if we go into NVIDIA Control Panel, then what we'll get is the ability to span the displays with surround. Hey, there we go. Wow, that actually is a really convincing effect. That's shocking, actually. All right, let's see what my peripheral vision sees here. (funky music) Oh! (funky music) These potato bots, that's cool. Well, you can't see behind you, but, yeah, you can see a lot, and this is not distracting. Obviously, this is kind of stretched out, but at the same time, your peripheral vision kind of is if you think about it. Like, okay, it kind of blurs on the sides here. So like, you can see a little bit of fringing on the text and stuff, but it's not bad. Yeah, it's missing what's behind the bezel. The game itself, I don't think it's even showing that on like, between the both the screens. My focus is on the center of the screen, and therefore everything else just kind of blurs into the background, including the blurriness of the bezels. And I'm not really missing any very important information. Yeah, yeah. See? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, perfectly fine. I think that's actually kind of awesome. It's kind of what I was hoping for when I tried triple monitor gaming on my own like, with my U2711s. I was like, \"Yeah, I can have triple monitor gaming. Yeah, the FOB is not perfect, but look, it works.\" But the bezels and like, compensating for the bezels, too. You do lose information that way. And this way, yeah, you kind of still lose some information, but it's actually, I think less information lost than bezel compensation would be. Let's try... we've got Project CARS on here. This game certainly was not meant with ultra wides in mind, nor multi-mon. See, I can look over and see my mirrors. There's nothing here anyway because that's the panel on the car. Well, I didn't claim to be good at playing racing games that are presumably realistic with a keyboard, but like, in a car even, you have plenty of little distractions all the time anyway. You have things that obstruct your view. And in this case, one of those things that obstructs your view just happens to coincide with a bezel. And over here like, I don't feel like I'm missing anything important in this little gap here. But it looks a lot more immersive, and that's kind of really amazing. So what can I say? It kind of works. It's a really weird hack. Like, it actually is like, basically a hack. We're not actually getting no bezels. We are getting the illusion of no bezels. But because you're focused front and center all the time in most games, it kind of fades away. And you just get this steady stream of information in your periphery that can actually help you in games. It's not as distracting I guess, as large bezels would be. And I mean, these aren't particularly large bezels, but they are larger than, I guess, the smallest. Obviously you wouldn't want to have this on your desktop at all times. Having this weird lens effects on your monitors all the time, especially on the desktop, is really, really annoying. The other thing about this: these are 240hz monitors. As far as I'm aware, you cannot currently get like, a high resolution 240hz ultra-wide. But you can do this with these. At $109 though, I guess you would really need to be annoyed by this little seam in between the monitors. But if you are really annoyed by that, and it does really distract you, and you have a triple monitor setup and you want to be competitive in your games, maybe it's worth looking at. I can't really say for sure that this is a good or a bad buy. It works. But yeah, that's about it, I guess.

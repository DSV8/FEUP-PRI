    "transcript": "- Hey Siri, I'm home. - [Siri] Home, sweet home. - This is HomePod, with an A8 chip, 6-microphone array, high-excursion woofer, 7-tweeter array, HomePod is more than just a speaker. Siri, do I have any any new messages? - [Siri] You have a new message from Postmates. \"Hey, it's Postmates, I'm on the way with your food.\" Would you like to reply? - Yes. - [Siri] What do you want to say? - \"Thanks, can't wait for my meal.\" - [Siri] Your reply to Postmates says, \"Thanks, can't wait for my meal.\" Ready to send it? - Yes. - [Siri] I'll send your message. - Hey Siri, turn on my teapot. - [Siri] Okay. - This thing is so fast, it's actually shocking. Hey Siri, turn off my teapot. - [Siri] Okay. - She'll not only read, write and send your messages, but she can control your entire home, from lighting, security, garage doors, thermostats, even outlets. Basically anything that is HomeKit enabled. Well the teapot's pretty cool, but one of the things that Apple is most known for is revolutionizing music, the way that we buy it, the way that we listen to it, the way that we experience it. And they're doing it here again, with the HomePod. You guys might remember back in January of 2001, at MacWorld was when they first introduced iTunes. - We're going to change all this today, with something we call iTunes. - [Justine] And then, a few months later, they introduced: - And we are introducing a product today that takes us exactly there and that product is called iPod. iMac, iBook, iPod. - Hold on, wait a minute, dramatic reveal. This. This is the original iPod. And this was released ... hey Siri, how long ago was October 23rd, 2001? - [Siri] It was 16 years ago. - 16 years ago! It's actually kinda crazy to just hear her say that. I mean, I knew how long ago it was, but to really just hear her say that, that really reiterated the fact that I'm getting old. Look at this, this is the HomePod my sweet boy. Would you like it? Oh! You've got a friend in me - This is our theme song honey. You've got a friend in me - Friend in me. You can also control HomePod with touch. One tap to pause, double tap to play the next track. (upbeat music) - And triple tap to play the previous track. (gentle music) - Instead of saying, \"Hey Siri\", you can just press and hold to activate her, and you can adjust the volume by pressing the plus or the minus, or by saying, \"Hey Siri, turn the volume all the way up.\" - [Siri] That's very loud, are you sure? - Yes. (\"All About That Bass\" by Meghan Trainor) - Hey Siri, stop playing. - What's crazy is there's a 6-array microphone surrounding this entire HomePod, so this thing can hear me from very far distances. Hey Siri, - [Siri] Mm-hmm. - Do you love me? - [Siri] Would you like me to search the web for love, just kidding. - What? I was skeptical when they first announced the HomePod, but now, after using it and experiencing it, it's pretty amazing. If it's placed in the middle of an open room, it'll give consistent 360 audio throughout, so no matter where you are in the room, it'll have the same perfect sound. The microphones listen to the reflection of the sound off of the surrounding surfaces, so even if it's next to a wall, it'll adjust appropriately for its new environment to make sure you're getting the best sound quality possible. I really want to demo this for you guys, so you can actually hear it, but it's going to be really difficult because you can't hear what I'm hearing in real life. You guys are on headphones, you're on your computers, but I'm going to do my best to give you a little demonstration, just know that this things sounds amazing. Hey Siri, play me some Lindsey Stirling. - [Siri] Sure. Here's a personalized station. of Lindsey Stirling. - Yes, yes, yes, yes, this is my friend! This is my friend, she's on my HomePod right now! (\"Mirror Haus\" by Lindsey Stirling) Hey Siri, who's this song by? - [Siri] This is Lindsey Stirling, with the track \"Mirror Haus\". - Hey Siri, text Lindsey Stirling and tell her that I love her. - [Siri] Your message to Lindsey Stirling says, \"I love her\". Ready to send it? - No, I think Lindsey might have been a little bit confused, getting a message from me that says, \"I love her\". Anyway, hey Siri, play me some Imagine Dragons. - [Siri] All right, let's hear Imagine Dragons. (\"Yesterday\" by Imagine Dragons) - Hey Siri, play another song on this album. - [Siri] Playing \"Believer\", by Imagine Dragons. - Oh, I love this one. (\"Believer\" by Imagine Dragons) - Hey Siri, skip forward 30 seconds. - Hey Siri, I forgot what I wanted to tell you. Hey Siri, who's the drummer of Imagine Dragons? - [Siri] Dan Reynolds, and Daniel Platzman play drums in Imagine Dragons. - My iMac Pro just arrived while we were shooting this video and we captured it all on film and I actually started crying. - Oh my god, I've been waiting a really long time for this. Okay, I'm just going to push it in, look, are you able to focus on these tears? I'm not this good of an actress, this is- - [Cameraman] Oh my god, I didn't see- - This is real emotion. Oh my gosh, I can't believe it's here early. Hey Siri, play some music for doing yoga. - [Siri] Okay, here's meditative music picked just for you. (gentle music) - Hey Siri, find me a yoga studio in Sherman Oaks. - [Siri] One option is Core Power Yoga, about 7.8 miles to your north as the crow flies, on Ventura Boulevard in Los Angeles, which averages four-and-a-half stars according to Yelp. - Hey Siri, is there any traffic to Sherman Oaks right now? - [Siri] Traffic to Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles is light, so I'm estimating 22 minutes via I-405 North. - Hey Siri, add to my \"really good video ideas\" list, to make a HomePod cake. - [Siri] Okay, I added \"video ideas list to make a HomePod cake\" to the reminders. - Hey Siri, let's go play some video games. - [Siri] Okay, let's hear \"Video Games\" by Lana Del Rey. - Huh, not exactly what I said, but okay. (\"Video Games\" by Lana Del Rey) (yelling and guns shooting) - Hey Siri, turn on my lights. - [Siri] All set. - Hey Siri, text my sister and ask her why she's not playing Call of Duty with me right now. - [Siri] Why she not play holiday looking right now. Ready to send it? - Okay, I'm slurring my speech, I apologize. I'm getting real amped about this game. Hey Siri, stop playing. So one of the things I do like about the HomePod is you can actually use it as speakerphone. So I'm going to call my sister, because she's clearly ignoring my text messages right now, which is very upsetting. Hold on, Jenna. - [Jenna] Hello? - Hello. - [Jenna] Hello? - Hi! - [Jenna] Hello, it's me! - It's you, Jenna E. Hey, do you wanna hop on Call of Duty, why are you ignoring my text messages? - [Jenna] So I can't do that right now, I'm watching Netflix. - All right, well I guess I'm going to go back to playing then. (yelling and guns shooting) - So not only am I able to AirPlay my speakerphone calls, but I can also AirPlay from Apple TV. So my Apple TV's up there, I can AirPlay what I'm watching here to the HomePod. Now it's not available yet, but you will, later this year, with a software update, be able to get two HomePods and use them in stereo. Depending upon what voice you have set for your Siri, HomePod will take on that voice. For example, here's the Australian male. - [Siri] Here's the podcast \"What does this all mean?\" - Also not available at launch, but really cool, with AirPlay 2 you'll be able to put a HomePod pretty much in any room, any corner of the house, and you can control her by rooms. So, for example, we're upstairs, hey Siri, play heavy metal upstairs. - [Siri] Now playing metal radio. - Yes, that's my girl. (heavy metal music) - Hey Siri, stop playing. And if you have one in the kitchen, you can tell her to play '90s rock in the kitchen, or play something else in the living room, but you can also sync them all up, and play one single thing throughout the whole house. Play some Slayer. - [Siri] All right, let's hear Slayer. - Please be \"Reign in Blood\". (loud heavy metal music) - Oh my gosh. Hey Siri, turn the volume to 20%. She can still hear me, over her loudness. Hey Siri, play \"Reign in Blood\". Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! You guys might not know, but I listened to heavy metal a lot in high school. (\"Reign in Blood\" by Slayer) Hey Siri, when was that song released? - [Siri] Reign in Blood by Slayer came out on October 7th, 1986. - 1986, okay, I was two. I wasn't listening to Slayer when I was two. Hey Siri, stop playing. Oh god, such a hit. Well thank you guys so much for watching, I have so far been enjoying the HomePod a lot more than I really thought I was going to. I have ordered a few more, so I will give you guys a full update, maybe, you know, you know how I roll. \"A week with HomePod\" video. I'm going to keep playing some Call of Duty, and I will see you guys later. I also did an unboxing video, so if you want to check that out, I'll put a link in the description, and an end-card here, and if that's the end of the video, I will see you guys on the battlefield. (yelling and guns shooting) - My Nintendo Switch was upside down. - [Cameraman] Oh no! - It's okay, it's not a big deal. Bake a HomePod cake. - [Siri] Okay, I added \"make a home podcast\" to your note \"really good video ideas\". - Now if you have one in the kitchen, you could say, \"Play jazz in the kitchen\", no, I don't like jazz, what am I talking about? It's not that I don't like jazz, if you like jazz, that's just not something that I listen to. Or maybe I should start. - [Siri] Video ideas list, video ideas, video ideas, or video ideas. - Oh my god. - [Siri] You're telling me. No, you just told me. - Siri, how many days is five thousand, four hundred and I forgot what you said already, so just ... - [Siri] It's 5946 days ago. - Oh, she just told me what I- - [Siri] I really couldn't say. - You know, me either. Hey Siri, let's get this party started. So good right now, why am I not going pro? Can you pick up a cake tomorrow? - [Jenna] Is this a real question? - No, it was for the video, it's okay, all right, bye! - [Jenna] Okay, bye. - She's never sure if I'm actually filming a video, or if it's a real-life question. Anyway. (upbeat music)",

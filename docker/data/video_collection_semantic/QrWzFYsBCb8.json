    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and today we are going to do a painting and not just any painting, we're going to be following a Bob Ross tutorial. These have been a really fun trend and I've been enjoying watching a bunch of people do these and do them sort of in their own style. Like Rosanna, she did this incredible painting with icing. So I was inspired to do one on the iPad, we're going to be using Procreate today, I haven't really used this app very much but recently in the past couple of weeks I've been messing around with it so that I can be familiar with brushes and colors and kind of just know the interface a little bit. The tutorial that we're gonna do, this is the Bob Ross, ocean sunset. This is season ten, episode ten. My grandmother's a painter so she used to always make me do illustrations and paintings and stuff when I was younger, and we used to watch Bob Ross together and do water colors and this is gonna be so much fun to do. I don't know what's gonna happen, I hope that it turns out well. I guess I'll stop talking, let's let's start the tutorial. - Ey, glad to see you again today, you ready to do a fantastic seascape? - Bob, I'm not ready yet! I don't have my colors set up yet, like I've got a lot of things happening! Okay, so I need a gray, he's gotta pause, I don't like I don't my colors, I don't ave my brushes prepped or anything. Gonna do I think in the painting, I'm probably going to go with artistic, oh nice oil, that sounds great. Is that good? Is that what we want? Gone off the screen. I don't know what if I'm doing a good job! Guess he's probably got some white so I'll just throw in some of the white. Oh shoot, there we go. So now he's getting into some yellow. And I'm not ready for that. Yellow here. I'm super into layers, so I will probably have a million layers. And this is the one terabyte iPad too, so I can pretty much make as many layers as I want. A little bit of red over here he says! Horizon, okay well, Bob. His blending is way better than mine. Problem is this, it's, it's not quite accurate, because I don't have the exact brushes that he has. - [Bob Ross] And beat the devil out of 'em. - Beat the devil out of 'em. Beat the devil out of my pencil! Looks like he's doing a little purpleish, so I'm gonna, gonna just do that as well. Oh these are clouds, I think I might need a different brush. Like, I'm beating the crap outta my iPad! (cheery music) Very gently, very gently he says. Oh this actually, this is a nice brush, this is working out really well! Some circular strokes, super into circular strokes. This is actually really fun! Oh, mine doesn't quite look like that. I love doing like- oh! That looks good! I'm an artist! I'm a freaking artist! It doesn't look that good, don't get too excited. - [Sam] Whoa! - But, you can add like the overlay - [Sam] Quite impressed. - It's getting there. We've got some things to do. Just gotta add a little of my own flare, because Bob this iPad wasn't around when you were around. Okay what are you doing now? You're putting some dark blue over there. Oh that looks actually really good! I should get more into water color, but I don't know if I like that brush. That's the problem is I don't know like what brushes to use. He's doing all kinda of things and I can't catch up! Oh gosh! We've made not much progress, he's got a little there, and then he's got a little more here. Alright, then we'll blend this. This is stressful! I don't know what it, what it was like to be Bob Ross but he's really good at his job. I was watching like some conspiracy theory Bob Ross videos the other day. I just don't know what to do. Fan brush! - [Bob Ross] You can add, some little streakers. - Oh, some little streakers! I love little streakers! Super into it, okay. He said we're making a big decision, I'm not ready! Draw the sea? Oh now we're doing the wave we're getting into the wave! Like, this. And then a this. And then a that. And then a that. Okay, it looks like, we've got that done. phthalo green in seascapes, okay, good to note. Everything he's doing, he's just, he's a perfect, perfect man. What, a little foot land, what color are you using? Purple, like a purpleish? We need darker. He's like there's all kinds of things back here but like, how do I make those things? We're gonna do another layer because I don't trust myself. Okay that little one goes like that, pretty happy with that. The best part about this is I don't even have to clean my brushes! It just, it's like just do it. Guess I can zoom in and really get some detail. Where's that layer at? Is this over here, is that you? That is you. I'm finally figuring out what brushes to use so this is all just really working out nicely! Except for this right here, this little piece is just bugging me. I have a lot more to do, we're 16 minutes and 34 seconds into the tutorial this is what we're at so far it's looking just okay. Now that I'm figuring out my brushes and stuff. This is gonna make a big difference when I really start working on this Oh no, he's moved on! He's moved on, I haven't even done the last step! Oh that's not a good brush, that's not the brush I need, that's not the brush I need! Is that what I want? I'm not sure. I'm gonna zoom in, I'm gonna zoom in and really get in there. I think that's kinda what he was doing. Yellow? What? Why are you using that? Now I'm confused. Think I may have done a little too much! Like, what did you just do? Some foam, okay! Okay that looks bad, that looks bad, just delete just delete everything. Bob, why does mine look like trash? - You wanna keep this color as pure as you can. - What are you saying? You're just, you're saying a lot of things. Oh look at that splash, wow Bob, I see what you're doing now! Yeah but his looks better! No no no no, you're going too fast, you're going too fast we're not ready. This is so fun! Am I having a fun time? Okay mine absolutely does not look like that. Absolutely not what I have going on here. I'm more of an abstract artist, I just can't work in these conditions. Now what do you want me to do? (deep breathing) I'm panicking. Yellow, orange, and then some red. Alright, now what? No, everything sucks. What now you have some brown under there? Okay. (cheery music) So I've been working a little bit more on this, I'm starting to get frustrated I think we've been filming for like an hour now. This tutorial is only 26 minutes, but I've been double that. But now that I've kind of developed some sort of style, I kinda wanna go back and redo the sky layer? Hello? - [Person On Phone] Okay um, it's kinda rainy out and I'm riding a bicycle. So I need to be a little bit more slower, so I apologize for the delay. - Oh that's totally fine, no worries! - [Person On Phone] Okay, thank you very much. I'll see you soon. - Okay, thank you, bye! So sky! So we're working on the sky a little bit. I'm gonna kinda merge all of these things together, so that I can really just I'm not sure, I'm not sure what I'm doing. But we're gonna duplicate this layer. Oh, wow! This just changed the game. So now we're gonna go in and get a nice little, a nice little something. Alright, so this is gonna be something that you're gonna wanna print out. You're gonna want to make it into a greeting card for your family. You're gonna be like, mom I made you something, dad, look at this grandma, I made this for you. and they're gonna be like That's trash. Get this out of my house. That's trash. His still just, it still looks better. But, I am still using an iPad, Bob. (cheery music) (Justine laughing) he's doing some more stuff. I've enjoyed it, have you enjoyed it? I've had a lovely time! How I need to add, so I gotta add some highlights to these rocks! Because that's something that I did not do! I think I'm running low on ink. (cheery music) I keep getting Postmates notifications, because, basically that's, every time I shoot a video it ends up just being me waiting for Postmates. Are they here yet? I just need that yellow to go away because that's something I'm not really that into. I think we're just gonna have to deal with it, like I think that's just what it's gonna be. I'll try one more thing to salvage this! Cause it looks like he did something like all up in here. Now I've just ruined everything, I quit! I quit, I quit, I quit! Okay, I'm gonna just delete this layer, I'm gonna just forget that it even happened. This is what we're gonna deal with. This is my final piece, let me sign it! I'm signing my name to it and I'm just gonna call it quits! There it is, my art. My art is done. I've completed my task. Okay so I can probably do this for several more hours but I need to stop myself. But, let me show you what I have done, this is my final masterpiece. In comparison to what Bob Ross has done. I don't know how I feel about it I feel like there's a lot more that I want to do to it. Thank you guys so much for watching! I hope you guys enjoyed this video, I really had a great time doing this. I did get a little bit frustrated at some point because I've never really used Procreate that much. So there was a bit of a learning curve and if you guys have used it before, please, leave some tips below. I would love to hear more from you guys. And if you would like to see me do another video like this let me know what you would like to see me do, leave those also in the comments below. And I'll see you guys in my next video. If you haven't subscribed already, be sure to hit subscribe. And like the video if you liked it. And if you didn't like it just hit like anyway and make my feelings feel better. Okay bye. Bob Ross, you're a legend! (cheery music)",

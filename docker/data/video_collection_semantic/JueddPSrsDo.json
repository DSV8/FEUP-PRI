    "description": "Microsoft has officially unveiled the Surface Studio 2. It looks very similar on the outside, with a 28-inch display at 3:2 aspect ratio and the classic Studio hinge that lets this giant all-in-one PC convert into a drawing mode. We got an early look at the Surface Studio 2 at Microsofts press event in New York City, and its good to see Microsoft has largely focused on the internals with this refresh.

    "transcript": "- Hey guys this is Tom with The Verge and I'm here in New York, looking at Microsoft's new Surface Studio 2. Now Microsoft was here two years ago launching the Surface Studio originally, and obviously had the giant 28 inch display. You could use the dial, the pen, all that, sort of, crazy stuff. But it was what was inside that kinda let it down. It was a little bit slow and it wasn't quite there. Now this model, it doesn't look all that different from the outside, but it's actually something you might want to use as your real PC now, just because of what's changed inside. Microsoft's upgrading the graphics card, the processor, and even the storage. So it gonna be a lot faster in performing. So first, lets check out what's changed on the outside. Now I'll be honest, not much has changed on the outside. It has the same 28 inch size display. Now, what's actually changed is it's 38% brighter, and it's actually 22% more contrast on this display. So Microsoft just tweaked the panel. It's gonna be pretty great if you're doing video editing or picture editing or anything like that. And that's really kinda what this device is geared towards anyway. Other than that, the base is pretty much the same thing. You got the power supply built into it, and all the internals are down here. And the display will go up and down, into sort of like a drawing mode. You've also, you've got the dial that you can put on the display, and you can get the cool app options to change colors for texts and stuff like that. So you still got the same surface pen support. But what's actually changed is, this is the latest surface pen, so it's got over 4,000 levels of sensitivity. It's also got the tilt support, so you can draw at an angle, stuff like that. So it's great if you want to use the pen support on it. Now obviously looking at it, it doesn't look like much has changed. But it really is what's inside that counts. Obviously, two years ago there was a hybrid drive inside. It was kinda slow, apps would launch a little bit slower, and it just kinda bogged the system down. Now Microsoft has actually switched to Applets this year. And there's a two terabyte SSD storage inside. Now on the base mobile that's one terabyte. And the base mobile also has an Nvidia GTX 1060 graphics card. Now if you know much about graphics cards, you'll know that's pretty capable for gaming, and certainly for video editing, photo processing and stuff like that. But there's also the model with a two terabyte SSD, has a GTX 1070 inside. So that's gonna be even more capable of gaming and any of the image and video processing further. Okay so that's all great news but there is one disappointing aspect to this. And that is Microsoft is not using the latest intel processors here. It's really disappointing. It's got the seventh generation Intel Core I-7 processor. That might not be a huge deal given the SSD's been upgraded and obviously the video GPU's are here. But it's just disappointing when you're spending three and half thousand dollars on this machine. You kinda want it to come with the latest and the greatest. Okay in terms of models and specs, the base model which is $3,499. You're gonna get one terabyte SSD storage there, obviously the Core I-7 processor, and it's 16 gig of RAM and the GTX 1060. And you can go all the way up to two terabyte of storage, and a GTX 1070, and that's gonna run you $4,799. So this is not a cheap machine by any means. And we'll have to see whenever we get to review it, just too see how much performance you're gonna be able to squeeze out of it this time. Microsoft is taking pre-orders now. We don't know exactly when you're going to be able to get your hands on it. But you can order it today. Okay, so that was a really quick look at the Surface Studio 2 here in New York. Now Microsoft's announced a bunch of other products here. So definitely check out and subscribe to The Verge's Youtube channel. Youtube.com/Verge.",

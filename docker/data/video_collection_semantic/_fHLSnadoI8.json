    "transcript": "Pow! Mophie, you've heard of this brand. That brand name. They do battery stuff. Probably most famously iPhone related batteries and battery cases. But they've been a little bit MIA on the iPhone 7 stuff, My opinion. What i liked about their last case, They had a battery case, to increase the juice on your device But also it featured wireless charging. I'm a big fan of wireless charging, You put those two things together, That's a nice little combination Today I've received this box right here I'm Thinking it might be something iPhone 7 Related. So We are going to jump into it, WOOAAH I Knew it! I knew that's what it was gonna be The juice pack air, iPhone 7 This is what the famous for, the battery case you love... But now with wireless power. Whoow! Look at the unboxing experience over here The iPhone 7, The 7 Plus, WOW! 27 hours of battery with the iPhone 7 Version, The 7 Plus 33 hours Wireless charging with the QI standard, So Any Wireless Charger you have, That is QI Compatible Will charge this up but they have.. Their own versions as well, And one of them has the magnetic attachment So It's the perfect charge every time. You don't have to,like, wonder if It's lined up That's a smart move! Comes in a few different colors as you can see over here 27 Hours talk time, 23 Hours web browsing, 25 Hours video playback And 77 Hours for music This is the wireless charge base Nice weight to it, I think it's metal. See, these guys they just know I love wireless charge Like: We gotta get it to Lew! A Micro USB Cable to connect the wireless charge base For the 7 Plus, It's not too sticky It's like a smooth kind of finish on it Micro USB On this side, So you don't have to charge wirelessly You can charge with the wire if you like The top just pops off, and the phone slides in Will do that in a moment. Over here we have the same thing before The smaller iPhone 7. Now What's interesting is when you're talking about the 7 It's a little more compact but it gets also slightly fatter At least it appears that way to me With the battery expansion you've got a slightly smaller footprint there To get a similar impact. Well Done! Alright So Let's just see how this magnetic charge base actually works. For the purpose of this video use the 7 Plus case. I'm gonna just slide this in real quick. That is super easy Look at that, I mean, That... That... That was easy enough to do. What you do is you hold this button here. You'll see the indication that it is now charging You're catching juice from the case now This is what I'm most interested in now Which is the magnetic charge base. So there's also other accessories as well, For the car, I think there's a desktop stand as well One of the drawbacks of wireless charging Is lining it up One coil, two coil, How many coi... Three coil charger So by mophie creating the case and the charger, You would assume there's going to be a match made here A marriage of this sort, A match made in heaven. You come home, It's dark, You know you're always fiddling with the.. I talk about this scenario often, Alright. You don't wanna be fiddling. It's never a good idea to fiddle Get right to the main attraction Get into the action. Well that's how this gonna... Ooh Ooooh! It just finds the spot, Look at that magnet at work. Now that's the move! As far as I'm concerned Let's just check this out Plug that in. Oh! That is nice. Charging Instantly. Don't even think about it, It's just second nature You get one of these chargers on your desk, One of them on your bedside table, And with the extra juice added from the case, That's It! You're never gonna need to be thinking about charging elsewhere. The 7 Plus already has a big battery to begin with. You extend it with this bad boy. And you have these chargers that are super convenient A super convenient place to put your phone I mean that's just a win! And it's.. it's... it's... it's finding the charge spot every time! If you're in the vicinity, It's grabbing it, even like this This might be the coolest implementation Of wireless charge I've ever seen And it certainly addresses those drawbacks that a lot of people have with it. Now keep in mind when i drop the case And phone down on the wireless charger there's a prioritization that happens So if the phone needs juice, the juice will go to the phone first Before charging up the case next. So the speakers get mapped out this way. And this is something where i feel like this case specifically actually improves the speaker performance on phone And the reason i say that is because By default they're firing down. And you know, you might be holding it like this, And your hand might be blocking the down firing speaker port, So by having them kind of reconfigured to fire out the front. It's actually a superior experience This guy is always so damn loud This guy's screaming it... Who's this guy? *Playing a video* It actually improves the performance a little bit In my opinion. I want them to make this for every single phone on the market. You see? You hear me Mophie? Here's my Pixel XL. Give me this, I want wireless charging, Alright? Magnets. And an extra battery life. Are they in stock? I don't know It's a hell of a gift",

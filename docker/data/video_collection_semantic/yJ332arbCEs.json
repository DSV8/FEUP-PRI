    "transcript": "What's up guys Lue here back with another video and today it is the second of this sort. This is cool survival tech inside this box, but each time the box is a mystery, or at least what is inside is a mystery. The box itself is pretty familiar. We find out together, what is included in this survival tactical mystery box. Let's do it. Now this knife that I am using, this kershaw here, actually came in the last box. I don't know if we are going to get another knife in this one or not. OK. All right..! Bush survival mission 5. Instafire... wait a second, what is this? Each pouch lights up-to 4 fires and it works in harsh conditions, with no harsh chemicals. This is cool, survival tech guys. It lights wet wood. Burns at nearly 1000 degrees. Burns on snow, water, and ice. Save a life, with flame. Uhh... okay. This is kind of heavy. Let's see what's going on here. Is this a sleeping bag? Feels maybe too heavy for a sleeping - oh there is like a rope in there. Is it a tent? This has got to be a shelter. Hold up. Oh wow, this my friends is a hammock. Now that - I can get with that. We're putting a hammock in the office. Boys we're putting a hammock in the office. Nap time here I come. You ever tried a hammock before? You need to re-evaluate your life. You know Jack is going to use that - you know it. Jack's hardly every awake. He's sleeping right now. Jack! Come on. *Shake* *Shake* *Shake* What do we have here? A fire piston. A little screw in there and they look like washers and then this cap on this side. Let's learn. *Pop* What is this one? Oh cool. That's actually a pretty nice leather wallet. Oh nice. I'm definitely going to use this. What is - this right here? Oh phone call, of course. Hello? Not too much what's going on man? I'll send somebody down. Oh. Jack: yeah. Lewis: That's what Steve brought. Sup man. Steve: Sup buddy. Lewis: Hahaha All right then. This got more exciting and probably more dangerous. Okay so this box here - I think it says nperk on it. Things just got quite... strange. That looks like a knife holster right there. This looks like another piston but like an old school style. Oh no that's - that's a knife. That is a cool knife man. Wow... Crazy cool pattern here on the blade and this looks - this looks like a legit sort of polished wood handle. Steve you want to check that out? Okay so this is obviously - this is a sharpener. I was thinking that this package was going to be all fire stuff when - with everything seemed fire related but it obviously has some other survival stuff in it as well. And this knife is going to be really cool. It goes in the little sheath. What do we have here? This is a bush craft leather firestarter necklace. Okay so this is like a piece of flint here that goes on this leather necklace. You've got your little pile of tender, this is around your neck, emergency situation you're going to die zombies are everywhere. They don't like fire right? Ohh look at this, beeswaxed jute tender spool. Essentially what we have here is this beeswax fibrous stuff here. You're still going to need a spark but this is going to help to catch fire and actually build a legitimate flame. Survival matches okay - check this out real quick. So we need to put some - some lighter fluid in this - in this container here. Hold it in hand, strike firmly on the magnesium and then it will light the end of it. Okay. Thompson snares, oh am I dealing with like a trap right now? Am I going to trap an animal? Directions enclosed for snaring muskrat, mink, rabbits, skunk, and similiar sized animals. So there is the snare... catching a - a rabbit? How to snare rodents and furbearers. So there is a couple options here for how to set it up. The last thing in the box is a burnable gift card. And this is like a magnifying glass situation. Fifteen dollars on a fourty five dollar minimum purchase. Who ever registers that first at WazooSurvivalGear.com you just got fifteen free dollars. And this is wood look and I can crack a piece off and stick it in the wallet another fire starter. So what we have discovered here today is that this is the perfect gift for... the pyro in your family. A pyromaniac. I promised you a flame, you're going to get a flame. Could I burn down the entire set? Yes, could I burn down the entire studio? Yes. Maniac. Okay, wish me luck guys. Wow! Is this the most dangerous unbox therapy video ever? It is right? Oh the char cloth is going. That's real smoke. Hold on. Do we have fire alarms in here? That's a flame my friend. It's where it all starts. And where it all ends. [If] you guys enjoyed this content make sure to leave a thumbs up down below. Thank you very much for watching and I'll catch you on the next episode. I'm going to put this out now. It's very hot on the bottom, where I am holding it. Hope you appreciate that. Later guys. That doesn't even put it out - I need, I need water. Maniac.",

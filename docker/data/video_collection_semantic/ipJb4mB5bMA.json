    "transcript": "- They didn't write me an intro, so I'm just gonna say it. Go buy a toque on LTT store.com. There's already been plenty of hype over the new Macs with Apple's M1's SoCs but Cupertino isn't appearing to be resting on their laurels, as it's reported that we're gonna be seeing a chip with up to 32 of Apple Silicon high performance cores, sometime in 2022. The chip is, somewhat unsurprisingly, expected to show up in an expensive Mac Pro product. But, if your pockets aren't quite that deep, reports also indicate that in 2021, which is, actually really soon all of a sudden. how did this happen? We might see iMacs and MacBooks with up to 16 of the high performance cores, and another four high efficiency cores that should be easier on the power consumption. GPUs ranging from 16 cores all the way up to 128 cores are also reportedly being developed on a similar timeline, though the focus might again be on more content creation, rather than gaming, in spite of having all these GPU cores. That is, given Apple's track record. Maybe we'll also see $1,000 set of wheels this time. And we'll get 32 of them. (laughter) The RTX 3000 series remains as difficult to get your hands on as ever. And you probably know that Nvidia infamously claimed that they had, plenty of supply but then that demand was just, super high. Now it seems Nvidia is finally sharing more details about what's happening behind the scenes. Samsung, who is the actual manufacturing partner for the GPUs, is not only experiencing shortages of Silicon wafers, they are also experiencing supply issues with other key components and materials. NVIDIA's CFO went on to say that supply will take a couple of months to catch up. But that's just an estimate at this point. The good news is that she also said that the situation was improving daily, and there would be more information released by the end of the month. So hopefully, for Christmas, you can get news about when you'll get your Christmas present. - [David] Here's a slip of information. - And we're right on the brink of the big Cyberpunk 2077 launch. David, how excited are you? - [David] So excited! - I know. And there's some good news for folks in Europe who want to play but don't have a fancy gaming rig. Google Stadia, which we'll be offering the game to stream, is now available in eight more European nations. Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, and Switzerland. The announcement was just made today. And some of you may not get access until tomorrow. But gamers in those countries should all have access to the service before the game launches on Thursday. This means Stadia is now offered in 22 countries in all. So hopefully those of you that live elsewhere will also get it sooner rather than later. Huh, this is one time that Canada did not miss out on something. - [David] We get the leg. - And we also get the bit quits, brought to you by Vessi Footwear, makers of comfortable, lightweight and water resistant shoes. With your Vessi footwear, you can walk in any terrain and keep your feet dry. Except for oceans. Because, if you actually step in something that's over the height of the shoe, the water does pour in. That's a design flaw. Vessi shoes are perfect for dressing up or dressing down, and they're lightweight and comfortable. What else do I have to say? They're lightweight, comfortable, and affordable. Grab your own pair and use offer code Techlinked to get $25 off at Vessi.com/Techlinked. Now onto the butt quacks. It's obviously hard to buy an RTX 3090 right now. So someone, or rather a group of someones, decided, screw it, we're just gonna steal a bunch. About 200 RTX 3090 cards were ripped off from a Chinese MSI factory today, with a value of over US$330,000. MSI suspects this was an inside job. And I know who I think it was. Another major cancellation due to the pandemic was announced recently, as Epic Games has released a statement saying, there will be no in-person events in 2021. Meaning the Fortnite World Cup has been deep sixed. However, there will still be online events including the Fortnite Champion Series. So, keep an eye out for that. If you care about it. And, or you could watch at home with a tray of round nachos with big plasticky cheese sauce if you really wanna recreate the in-arena experience. Thank you for that, John. - [John] Played, ROBLOX. - Although Apple and Google are mostly known as rivals, Google has made Apple Music available via Google Assistant. Meaning that you can now get it on devices like the Nest Audio. This will be a welcome addition, considering Google recently gave the ax to Google Play Music. But don't expect Google to allow you to change the assistant's voice to sound like Siri. That feature is not available yet. LG is well known for their OLED TVs. But now they've formed a partnership with a door manufacturer, to make transparent OLED doors, that could greet people or show them ads as they walk into a store. Do I have to live in this future? - [David] Well, then you don't need-- - No, - [David] Talking to the (mumbles) front door. - No, I don't want, no, I don't want it to do what I, that's not a problem I have. And if you're bored to tears during the pandemic, you can now live out some of your super spy fantasies on YouTube, which is now streaming 21 different James Bond films, absolutely free, ranging from the original 1954 \"Casino Royale\" to \"The World is Not Enough.\" Unfortunately, I don't think Google Stadia is letting you extreme \"Goldeneye\" just yet, but, we're holding out hope. - [David] Are we? - And that's our show. Come back on Wednesday for more tech news, shaken, not stirred. And go buy a beanie. Ah, damn it, I said beanie. It's a toque, I'm Canadian. - [David] Please, respect that. - LTT store.com.",

    "transcript": "(box contents rattle) - You hear that? I think it is Kind of Retro Time. This is the Evercade EXP, experience, whatever. Basically, what it is, it's a emulation handheld that takes cartridges. The box is very plain, there's nothing else to it. There's a little bit of RGB here but I don't know if that indicates anything. Oh, okay. So, it's a box within a box kind of thing. It comes with the TOAPLAN arcade kit. This is a cartridge of TOAPLAN arcade games. That's one of the things that the Evercade EXP or Evercade lineup is actually really good for is a lot of these games, basically, like arcade games don't really get re-releases very often but, they do on the Evercade. You get a little key chain here it's the shape of a cartridge. What's on the other side? Ha! Insert cartridge. Yeah. I don't know if you wanna insert this one but, maybe it fits. If it does, that'd be cool. You get a carrying case, so you got a little old spot for the handheld itself and for some games, yeah they got little pockets in here, sub pockets you get a little cleaning cloth. Evercade EXP So, you got Evercade EXP the console itself TATE what that basically means is: vertical. And, that's one of the party tricks of the Evercade EXP is that you can actually hold it this way and play vertical shooters I'm looking forward to trying that out. Wow. Unlike the outer box, this box is just crammed with all kinds of stuff. You got some Street Fighter on this side you got some Mega Man and 1942, on the other side. I guess this is a Capcom bundle? Yeah, games from Capcom and IREM. Okay, so I guess this might be like a collector's edition pack or something. I'm not entirely sure. This is what you would get normally if you buy it. Yeah, A fair number of decent Capcom games in here. We've got Street Fighter 2 Hyper Fighting all the MegaMan. Wait, MegaMan and MegaMan 2 and Mega Man X? Interesting selection. Let's get this guy out of the box and see what it looks like. Ah, yeah. Now, the original Evercade really looked plasticky and this does too, but it looks a lot more premium. It reminds me of how the DS light looked and felt when they first announced it. Whereas the original Evercade had the red accents and it all kind of looked kind of \"Meeeh\". D-Pad, I mean it's okay, it's serviceable. Doesn't really feel all that definitive like it kind of moves pretty freely. Maybe that'll be good for fighting games? The buttons though. The face buttons? Actually, they are okay. There's more snap to the Y button up here than there is to the A button, down here. This feels a little bit more mushy whereas this is a little bit snappier. It's not a huge difference, but you you'll notice it. Now, these... these are also a little bit mushy, but it's probably fine. It is a little awkward to hold like this, though just saying, there there used to be like a little indent or something on the back here, but it's just flat. So holding it like this, you're just like I mean it's like holding your phone by this little part of it down here. It's not an amazing experience, but hey, you can do it. On the bottom here, we've got a USB type C and a headphone output jack. Don't know what this button is for. This is obviously the volume controls and I don't know what this is, either. Some kinda light? Oh, it's, it's marked with a T. So presumably, this is the mode to switch over to TATE like, vertical. So, like if your game is like this and, you know, you want to do full screen you'd hit the T and then you do that. And, of course you've got the great big honking cartridge slot on the back there. And, I think the reason it's that big I mean, it doesn't have to be they actually have full compatibility at least as far as I can tell from the marketing materials with the original Evercade cartridges which, I think they now have like 30 or more all of which have well, most of which have more than five games on them. A lot of them, actually, have like more than eight. Also, you have a little mini HDMI port up there if you want to plug it in your TV. I'm not sure if that's something that you'd really want to do, but it's there. Shoulders are, they're fine. It probably wouldn't be too bad. I mean these are kind of older games so, you're not going to be using these triggers on the left and right so often, but you know it's something to take note of. Yeah, here we go. So... Right, this is the IREM arcade cartridge. Presumably, the Capcom games are just built into this thing. So, I was correct. That T is the TATE mode button. And that light... when it's red, it's charging when it's blinking green, it's booting up and when it's blinking red, it's time to charge. I appreciate this. This is actually, nicely laid out. So, this is a really nice touch. I like this. Maybe it's just the nostalgia in me liking old instruction manuals you can flip through on the toilet. I don't know. Let's pop a game out and see what that looks like. Okay. You also get an instruction manual with this much the same, it's a different form factor. So, why cartridges? I mean, aside from the fact that it's like, honestly pretty satisfying to just do that... Uh-oh. Okay. It's a little tight on the current gen console. I'll say that. That was a little harder than I would've expected. It's, it's a pretty tight fit to get it into the slot and, I'm not sure if that's by design or if it's just because this is brand new and it needs some time to wear in. There's more to it than just getting the games. Plus, all of these are fully licensed so, it's not a piracy console or anything like that. Speaking of which... That's not even like, half of them. Like, they've got 30 of these now. We've got IntelliVision, we've got Atari. These are new games, I think These are Evercade exclusives. How about that? The Atari Lynx collection, Jaleco. And of course we've got, I say, of course I don't think I've ever heard of Gaelco. How about we turn it on and see how it plays. But first, I'll talk to you about our sponsor.

Head to the link in the description below and check out Secret Lab, today. (gameplay sounds) Speakers don't sound amazing. So, the first thing we get is our cartridge which is the IREM arcade collection. Then, we can go over to our built-in games. There's hidden games. We can unlock games. I would prefer that they were already unlocked. Presumably, this is maybe the downloadable section? I don't know. It says coming soon. And, what I presume, are the settings. Okay, so display. Okay, cool. We have aspect ratios so we have the original ratio we have Pixel Perfect, which will be an interview scale. It'll give you black borders most of the time but that way you won't have any weird scaling artifacts like blur or misshapen pixels. And, full screen is if you are a monster and you like to play your 4:3 games in 16:9. I'm not sure why this...Oh right, because of TATE mode. Okay. Dynamic rate control? I guess it has adaptive sync. I'm not sure why you'd have that off. Oh wait, maybe that's not what that is. Maybe what that is, is speeding up or slowing down the game to sync to the refresh rate of the display. Maybe that's why it's off by default. I don't think that this has any settings information in that little quick start guide. So, I'd have to check the online manual And secret. Okay. It's got code entry screen I guess for unlocking games, maybe. Again, it's cute, but I'm pretty sure that I would prefer to just have these features unlocked. Let's see how MegaMan 2 looks. They've got all the play controls and stuff here, too. That doesn't sound right to me. No, it's not because of the volume. It's like... Bit crushed, which is strange because it's 8 bit. But yeah, that... that's not clipping, that's... that's just gritty. I'm not sure why that is but, I guess it doesn't really matter, if the game plays OK. Oh man, that sounds crunchy. Now that's, that's unpleasant, I'm sorry. I don't know how the headphone output sounds or how the HDMI output sounds but, these speakers don't sound very good with this. Oh, that's the menu key. Well, while we're here quick save, we can I think, maybe customize the controls? No, we just have the controls. Okay. It'll be nice if you had control customization, as well. I can see myself hitting the Menu button a lot instead of hitting Start. These buttons are lower than the menu button. I'm gonna turn this down. Uuuhhh... Did I not hit A? Does A not jump? No, it doesn't. Oh, oh, okay. It's B. Oh, I don't like this. I like, I like this layout, like pressing X per shoot and A to jump. I don't think I can do that. No, I can't change the controls. Oh, that's... I don't like this. Mmm... A couple frames of lag. Well, I mean, it feels pretty responsive but I don't... I'm not happy with the NES emulation. Let's try a vertical game. OK, so I can TATE-mode that's I guess... Select for credits? Yeah. Just dump coins in there. Uuuhhh... This also sounds a little crunchy. TATE mode rips really well, though. It is a little, like I have to brace my hand in a different way. What I'm doing is, I'm holding my hand like that so that I'm actually like supporting the higher part of the console and then I'm like kind of tweaking my thumbs down. It's like kind of, it's not super comfortable, but it works. So, when you're in TATE mode even these on-screen controls up here use these lower buttons. Ah! I, I keep thinking the confirm is on the right because that's kind of how it is in, well on the NES, and also in like, most Japanese controllers. What's a more modern title here? I mean Breath of Fire, like Super Nintendo. Yeah, let's run MegaMan X and see how that works. I'm, I'm not looking forward to how this sounds based on what I've heard so far. That's actually not bad. The stereo is pretty good, too. Yeah, the sound doesn't sound bad. The graphics, I mean... That doesn't look terrible to me but, it's kind of small, so it's difficult to see if there are any major errors. It looks like the stretch might be making some inconsistent pixels here, on these status bars. Yeah, it's not something I can see at this angle to show the camera but if I were to look at it straight on I think I would notice. You can kind of tell in X's health bar up here. I'm not sure if that looks off or not. It's a small screen. Otherwise, it seems to play pretty okay for the Super Nintendo games. It seems like it's just the NES games that it kind of sucks for. The emulator is just bad. The audio sounds like it's being mixed at 11 Kilohertz or something which is not enough. 1.5 gigahertz. Presumably, it's just an ARM of some kind with 4 GB of system memory. You could get by with, like maybe, 1 GB or 512 MB depending on the complexity of the operating system. So, presumably it's because of all the artwork and stuff that they had to preload here. I think that CPU is definitely fast enough to do accurate NES and super NES emulation. So, I'm not sure why it's like that. Maybe it can be fixed in a firmware update? Obviously, this is software based so it's not like it's going to be fixed in that way. I guess, that's one of the advantages to having this platform is that, you know when you buy these games, a future revision of the console could actually make them play better or give you more features to make the gameplay experience better. It's tough to really fully analyze the gameplay experience because I don't know if it's going to be the same throughout the lifespan of this console but those NES games they just sound bad. At $149 for the console, and about $20 or $25 for each of those. It's not a bad value, it's just... I feel like there are better ways to play these games. It's tough. I want to like this, but the quality of the emulation at least on the NES side was just unbearable. I don't know, maybe that's just the Capcom thing. Maybe, each of these games has its own encapsulated emulator and, this is just running it. I don't know what the architecture of the system looks like. If you're gonna carry this around with you, I mean assuming you have the official carrying case you got this, and you've got room for two games in here. I guess, make sure that you choose the games you wanna play. It's a little inconvenient to carry around you know, your library, right? This would be better, I think, for the home console version of the Evercade, the Versus. As nice as the cartridges are a downloadable experience would probably be a lot nicer and, I don't see a spot for an SD card or anything like that so, I don't know how much storage is even on here. They need to improve the emulation. The console itself feels pretty solid. I mean, it is a little chunky but that's okay, because it's makes it easier to hold unless you're holding it like this, in which case... But at least you have the option, right? So yeah, it seems like the software is letting it down mostly and the software ecosystem as well. It's the biggest strength and its biggest weakness, I think. Why is it getting warm? I mean, it doesn't seem like it is really doing much. Like right now, it doesn't seem like it's doing much but it's still warm. It feels like they've got a lot of work to do. They've got a lot of work to do on the software ecosystem and, they've got a lot of work to do on, you know, just making sure that the experience is okay now. They say you can get 4 to 5 hours of battery life on this. That's enough I guess. I mean, it's not going to be similar to the old school Game Boy or anything like that. I mean, it's comparable to a Switch assuming that's correct. I mean, we've been playing this whole time and it hasn't ticked down at all. It was already at three bars on the battery. As it is right now, I would recommend it only if you really want these cartridges. And, that's really the bottom line. There are better handhelds to have and, if you have a game collection already you can dump your own games. And, there's no piracy required for following Short Circuit. We have plenty of other things like this, and not like this. There's retro time. There's not retro time. What time is it now? You decide.",

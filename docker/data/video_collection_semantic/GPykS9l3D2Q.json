    "transcript": "hello everyone i'm Dmitry with Hardware Canucks and the oneplus 5 is an attractive device the price is less appealing versus the 3t but it's still awesome to have such high capacity storage for a lot less and then we're normally used to plus their approach to clean software is fantastic it doesn't get better than this outside the pixel lineup the hardware is nothing to complain about although the full utilization of that a gigabytes of RAM is questionable but the phone feels incredibly fast the new curved body is gorgeous the 1080p AMOLED screen is the perfect compromise between pixel density and battery life and the dual camera is of course the main highlight here that is good but there are a lot of asterisks that are sort of associated with all these positive features so is the oneplus 5 for you let's break it down right after this the Graham spectrum keyword bike Tesoro comes with a new mechanical agile switch with low profile key caps with super fast response and shorter actuation distance plus all the customization included with RGB lighting and macros for a premium user now a few days ago I ran a Twitter poll to see how you guys use your smart phones the most and surprisingly there were very few clicks in the camera department so let's see how the oneplus 5 handles all other aspects that people rely on so let's begin the experience with the body that absolutely requires a skin or a case I love the original sandstone texture that is grippy and that is needed not only for holding the Oneplus 5 but also picking it up as the smooth curved edges have zero grip which is why I prefer the body design of the oneplus 3 but everything else is pretty much identical with clicky power and volume buttons although they are now much thinner but still have very nice clicking the student the fingerprint scanner is incredibly fast without minor vibrations for feedback the notification light is excellent on the top left corner with colour customization available and the type C port is at the bottom that is still a USB 2.0 interface I wish more Android phones had the alert slider so you can quickly enable silent mode or on the store mode and customized them a little bit so for example when I'm taking a nap and I want to still receive phone calls for my favorites FedEx and UPS I can still hear that phone call come through and not miss a package the headphone jack at the bottom surprisingly is powerful enough to drive my HD6XX so I'm very happy with the amp output and it absolutely kills the iPhone 7 in volume the single speaker hover is way too easy to block it is very loud in the cache call Youm it's too harsh so find yourself a bowl and oneplus 5 turns into a so now the screen it's received good praise because of calibration tools so I prefer the srgb mode because it's just the most natural colors but if you like a more saturated look we have the color customization and also a temperature adjustment the resolution at 1080p is fine the brightness outdoors though it's kind of weak so you know I always have to keep it at 100% even indoors to get that nice vibrant and bright effect which so I wish that this screen was a bit brighter however the minimum brightness is very low which is good so you won't be blinding yourself or anyone around you if you check your phone during the night but the blacks do tend towards the purples so you know the color accuracy is not there anymore at this lowest setting but really what got people riled up is the jelly effect on the screen when you swipe up and this jelly effect is visible because the screen on the oneplus 5 is mounted upside down and we're told that is to make room for some other hardware components on the inside most likely for that dual camera at the back so the jelly effect is only visible when you scroll up and I can recreate the same jelly effect by flipping my oneplus 3 and you can see the jelly motion here as well that top portion or the bottom portion of the screen has that little bit of stretch now I can recreate the same effect with my galaxy s7 if I flip the screen around I think that's the nature of the AMOLED screen and how the refresh cycle works and you know I can sort of live with the jelly effect on the 1+5 what I cannot lift though is the touch screen latency which on the oneplus 5 is just terrible now when I say terrible I mean in relation to my experience with the iPhone 7 and the galaxy s7 that have very little if any touch latency so everything on the screen when you interact but it feels like it's one to one on one plus five on the other hand that's not the case so it is very noticeable when I'm swiping and I tap the screen for it to stop there's a delay between my tap and when the screen actually stops at least it feels to me that way also when I'm typing with both thumbs it feels like the text is trying to catch up to me so there's that visual delay which is very annoying or when I'm holding long pressing the delete button it always deletes more verses when I lift off the some off the delete button they're just so annoying because it creates that's weird contrast as this phone being praised one of the fastest smartphones on the market right now but it has that weird a sluggish feeling on the touchscreen latency situation so it's not ideal and so that is my biggest complaint with the oneplus 5 alright so now let's talk about the camera the selfie mode is wider than my iPhone and the handles backlight better but the s7 despite its softer look is still my favorite with direct light the iPhone has the most detail but I still prefer the galaxy selfie so the oneplus 5 is in that middle with good field of view exposure is fine and white balance most of the time is okay so now the dual lens situation at the front is well implemented although it needs to be clarified that it's not an optical 2x zoom it's actually 1.6 X optical zoom and the rest is handled digitally in the software and so despite the high resolution the fine detail is kind of missing and it looks too processed and really kind of falls apart in dark setting as with any smartphone camera you want to have the best lighting possible but I think the hyped optic camera resolution and detailed so much like it's literally written on the side of the box that I was kind of disappointed to not see the detail that I was expecting the portrait mode is kind of cool and edge detection is passable you can even do self-portraits which are really cool with this nice background compression it doesn't work all the time and honestly I would have taken a wider field of view for that second lens like on the g6 versus the extra zoom and that is because just like on the iPhone 7 plus the second lens is only engaged when there's enough light so actually most of the time even with like good lighting in my studio I would cover up the zoom lens and take a shot or actually see what the camera is looking at and it will still be using the main lens with a 2x magnification and not the zoom lens so that's kind of unfortunate I rather do that on a primary lens but have like a really nice wide angle like on the g6 to capture a lot of the environment and stuff and I think that would have been a much better direction for oneplus to take some other important features to note include a reading mode so it turns everything into grayscale with nice warm paper look I read books on Kindle so this is very relevant to me you can also choose your vibration intensity and even pattern though it is kind of weak at least nothing beats the iPhone vibration the lockscreen has expanded a little bit to accommodate more room from the education versus what we saw on the oneplus 3 and - charging remains the same it's super fast never have to worry about battery life when plugging in and for like 20 minutes gets you good recharge I also want to mention the flashlights on the month plus five is pretty weak when compared to the iPhone 7 something to keep in mind if you use the flashlight often and as of July 20th oneplus have patched out the 911 rebooting bug when the phone would restart when try to call 911 - services so that wasn't Pleasant but they've patched out the software update and they released like 5 OTA updates so far so that means they're kind of staying on top of things and listening to what the community is figuring out in terms of the bugs and the oneplus 5 so overall I'm pretty happy with the oneplus 5 but we're in a difficult price territory where the device is kind of expensive to not have any rubber seals or adhesive for water resistance 4k video is actually worse versus the oneplus 3 because for some reason there is no image stabilization on the oneplus 5 at 4k and from the value perspective the oneplus 3t sounds like a better deal because even if you're after that 2x zoom in most situations like I mentioned earlier you'll still be utilizing that main camera for that 2x magnification unless you have the ideal ton of light in your in your scene for that second lens to engage and so to the most part the oneplus 5 checks off many of those priority elements that people want to see but I wish that the touch latency was reduced alongside have some water resistance rating so that its feature set could be closer to all those flagships that a lot more expensive while still maintaining that price advantage and that price distance and so that's all I have to say about the oneplus 5 what do you guys think are you picking one up yes or no let me know in the comments below and why don't forget to subscribe for more similar content if you guys enjoy this review and we'll see you in the next video",

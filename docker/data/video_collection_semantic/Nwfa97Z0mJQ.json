    "transcript": "this is the sub hundred dollar Chromebook I did a video on a while ago and in the comments section of that video a bunch of you were telling me to just install Linux on this arm-based Chromebook and then all of my wildest dreams will come true well I tried to install Linux on this arm-based Chromebook and it didn't go very well the world definitely does not seem like a better place on this end of the video making process so brace yourselves for a whole bunch of incompetent men shouting at Chromebook action if I can't even get past this step my brain clearly doesn't think good enough for me to be able to do this process I know it doesn't have Chrome OS on it that's the point which is all your fault every little bit of it is your fault and because of that I'm gonna make you watch an ad now after a long hard day at work I like to soothe my brow with a steaming hot couple of note there's just nothing quite like a good reliable Linux based cloud computing service for all your web hosting and computational needs top it off with industry-leading customer support and you've got a winner trial a node today and new accounts get a hundred dollar sixty day credit foreign IX in theory is good for Chromebooks because you can unlock more advanced feature sets than Chrome OS offers which is about as advanced as the 12 year old smart fridge the problem is this Lenovo Chromebook has an arm-based CPU in it which supposedly complicates things quite a lot and that mixed with my very successful history of Linux usage means this is probably going to go about as well as that time the CIA got involved in Cuba now Jokes Aside I'm actually semi-confident that running Linux on this Chromebook may not be that hard to do a statement that's definitely going to come back and bite me wow AI but the reason that I think that is because Lenovo has a whole page dedicated to linuxing on their Chromebooks now on this page they give two options of varying complexity when it comes to linuxing on a Chromebook the first one is a built-in beta feature which is supposedly very easy to access and that's the first one we'll try and then the second option is just fully installing Linux on this little Chromebook Lenovo even suggests specific distros that they think would work well on a Chromebook Linux destroys that just gently sip resources so they can work well on a little bit of Chromebook now I really appreciate that as somebody that sees Linux as a disease you may catch if you hang around boring people too long anyway with that let's try the built-in beta feature and take it from there now according to Lenovo activating the built-in Linux environment on these Chromebooks is really easy you just go to settings turn turn on username 10 gig that is basically the entire storage configuration of the little Chromebook OS update required okay well I guess that's some Linux over there which means I am immediately scared and confused like what what do I do now sudo apt that's I know that Linux involves sudo apt I think okay let me Google it with Google's help I soon found a computer World article that told me in detail how to do some Linux on Chrome OS hey there's some Linux happening that's cool now it took Linux quite a while to finish happening on the Chromebook wow this has been linuxing for ages but once it did Libra office was installed which is like a freeware Linux alternative to Microsoft Office wow this is really useful and a great way to expand the base functionality of a little Chromebook nice now you can also install [__] on here I was quite disappointed to find out that it wasn't the exciting kind of [__] but a very practical [__] that lets you do photo editing and stuff probably not the most useful photo editing device considering that the display isn't very color accurate and the Chromebook is painfully slow but it's nice to have photoshoppy software available for free it's pretty cool now this is all a little bit practical and boring for my liking so let's try and do something that is actually cool and sexy on it let's try and install some Linux steam there were three ways in which I attempted to install a not just useless Chrome OS theme using this lineup developer environment the first was to just blindly type sudo apt-get install Steam which very surprisingly didn't work my second method was to try and enable Borealis through crotch I mean crash which may sound like gibberish but Borealis is like a Google developed project to get Steam games running natively on Chromebooks but unfortunately that didn't work either of course it's not been released on this device that would have been way too convenient apparently Borealis doesn't support arm-based Chromebooks and not meaning to spoil anything but that's going to become the dominant theme of the rest of this video my third and final attempt was to use flat Hub which is like a local watering hole for Linux apps which even has a setup guide specifically for Chrome os's Linux environment but despite even using the crotch tab the setup failed at which point I found a compatibility list which did actually have a couple of arm chips listed as compatible but quite predictably the chip in my Lenovo just wasn't one of them okay well I feel like I finally exhausted all my options in terms of natively gaming on here using loser Chrome OS Linux so now I'm going to try and install some proper neckbeard Linux on here and see if I can get real steam running using that the research was grueling finding the best way to install Linux on an arm-based Chromebook was an arduous process and after what felt like eons of preparation I was finally ready ah ah why what is that localhost login I don't know and because I have to type in root now it's just in red it's red now and now I don't know what to do because it's not how do I go back to it having I don't know what I'm doing okay I'm gonna try to turn it off again now I'm back in this bit without the red so if I go root return that happens and then if I type in enable success wait what this didn't work last time okay very nice now I need to figure out how to make boot media despite being very confused by the color red I finally got USB boot enabled on the little Chromebook which was the last bit of progress I made before I descended into a pit of despair okay and then Ctrl D needs to happen and then it doesn't do anything it's worked before but it's not working now why are you so obtuse every guide I look at it tells me to do this but it doesn't turning it off for the ninth time and I'm gonna hold it for longer and then I'm gonna give it a minute so that it Finds Its bearings or whatever and makes itself comfortable gets a cup of tea okay arbitrary amount of time passed d come on control D why doesn't it work this time why if I can't even get past this step my brain clearly doesn't think good enough for me to be able to do this process I know it doesn't have Chrome OS on it that's the point now I've gone through lots of shouting and I've come to the conclusion that while I think it is technically possible to install Linux on this specific arm-based Chromebook I don't think it's technically possible for me to install Linux on this arm-based Chromebook because it seems to be an extremely difficult thing to do even if you know what you're doing as far as I understand basically what you have to do is like create a Chrome OS install file on a flash drive and then like grow a Linux distro inside that Chrome OS install like a virus so that the virus Linux kernel uses the Chrome OS kernel of the specific Chromebook or summon and I can't just download the correct kernel Linux because a Linux Savant hasn't made one for the specific laptop yet so I have to make it myself and I can't I'm probably not understanding that correctly but that is my interpretation of it and I just think it's not within my capability to do it because a I don't follow instructions very well and B the moment the instruction tells me to do something I do the thing and it doesn't happen monkey growls come out and things get thrown around it just isn't in my wheelhouse to do this whole thing and besides considering that the Chrome OS install on here has linuxy features built into it I think installing like a just blindx bare metal onto it is not even nearly worth the effort so with that please don't ever ask me to install Linux on random crap again because all of this additional strain on my heart and subsequent reduction in life expectancy is your fault random Linux commenter I hope you're proud of yourself and until the next video bye-bye foreign",

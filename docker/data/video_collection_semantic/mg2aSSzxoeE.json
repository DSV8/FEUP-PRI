    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine. I'm here with Marques, and we're in your studio. - Yeah, we're in the East Coast. It's not so great outside, but it's nice and controlled in here. So it's awesome. (rain pouring down) - So you know, I was like, \"Marques, listen, \"you think that Matty can come meet Mac?\" - And they met, and they're friends now, and they follow each other on Instagram, and it's all great. - It's the most incredible thing ever. Here's a little clip. (dogs panting) So today I thought we would do a week with iPhone video, 'cause I've been meaning to do one, but at this point, is it like, three or four weeks that we've had? - Something like three weeks with the iPhone 11. - So however many weeks it's been, how has it been for you? - Pretty good, so I've been on Space Gray iPhone 11 Pro Max. I thought I might go down to the smaller phone just for this one, but I just like the bigger screen, of course. I had the Midnight Green one that Apple gave as a review unit. It's fine, I don't know how big of a Midnight Green fan you are, I've met some people who love it, not so much for me. - It's definitely not my color preference of choice, but it was crazy because usually how I guage if something is cool or not is if my real friends in real life start messaging me and saying, \"That's cool,\" or something like that. - Or asking about it. - So I had way more people than I ever expected say that they love that color. - I've had the same phenomenon. People have been like, \"I want that green, \"midnight green is sweet.\" I got the space gray. - I got the silver, and of course I added this nice razor pink case to it. - It looks white. - Yes. - Very close, and closer to white that others, 'cause they've had these bright white colored phones in the past, but yeah, this is the brightest one yet. But I'm curious, like, how that looks with scratching. 'Cause it's matte white, which is probably great for not showing fingerprints. - Yeah, but the scratching, on the other side, it's insane, actually. This is really kind of shocking as to how scratched this has gotten. I mean I know I'm usually pretty abusive with things. - The front of my midnight green one that I had got some serious scratching, and that's probably 'cause I had it in the same pocket as another phone, and they just like to attack each other, and that's fine. This one I've kept in great shape. I'm probably jinxing it, but I don't have any blemishes yet. Have you gotten the battery life claimed improvement that they said they would give? - I think the battery life is better, but it's hard to tell, because I used to have the battery charging case, so that extended it so much that I would have to go back to just making sure I always have like a movie charger with me or something with me, because I was so used to that battery life. It does seem longer. - It's pretty good. I mean a lot of people, including me, used the 10R a lot last year, so we're so used to this great battery life, but it is very good now on the 11 Pro Max. Best name, but battery life's pretty good. - I've also been enjoying taking the wide-angle photos, especially with the video. I think as long as you're in decent lighting, it makes a huge difference, 'cause trying to take low-light, wide-angle photos doesn't work out so well. - Not so great, the lens is-- (dog barking) - [Justine] They're having fun. - [Marques] They're both guarding the door now. - [Justine] There's the wide-angle shot. We got the zoom in, and the 2X. One thing that I have noticed is the consistency though throughout the three lenses. 'Cause I was doing a video with the OnePlus 7T. It was crazy just to see the consistency in those three camera lenses. - Even the OnePlus 7T is better than some other phones I've used this year. I remember the ROG Phone 2 has an ultra-wide, and it looks like a completely different camera. I think there's one or two others. So calibrated from the factory should look much better, but like you said, there's no night mode on the ultra wide. It's not quite as perfect. I didn't expect it to be, but it's pretty good. - I do really like it. I also like the front facing, having the wide angle option. - Wide angle front facing, yeah. - Which is pretty nice. And I just recently upgraded one of these phones. Not gonna tell you which one, to the beta that has the Deep Fusion installed. So I wanna see if you can see which one is which. - So one of 'em's Deep Fusion, and one of 'em's just a regular photo? - Yes. - Okay, I will try. You know which one. - Do I know which one? Hold on a second. Okay. - Sounds like you don't know which one either. Am I allowed to zoom, or should I just look at the... - I think you're probably gonna have to zoom. Here you go. - Okay, so spoiler, I've seen a couple Tyler Stalman Tweets where he shared some photos side by side, and the biggest difference is in dim lighting, but not quite night mode lighting. Without zooming in, the only difference I see is a little more dynamic range on the left side. Just a little, and when I zoom, I don't see much difference here. - Problem which is not even a problem at all is the iPhone does take really good photos. This is a little further away, so maybe this'll make a difference. - The difference with Deep Fusion, I think, is it's just on all the time, but it makes more of a difference with lower light photos and with high detail photos. Both very sharp photos, little prance going on with Mac's paw. - I think this one might be a little bit better of an example. - Really, okay. - Only because I've noticed something that may look a little sharper. - Okay, I'm looking at the foam in the background, and actually the foam in the background, it's so subtle, but it's a tiny, tiny bit sharper on the white iPhone. - But look over here. This looks also sharper on this phone. - [Marques] Oh yeah, so now the white bricks in the background on the wall are definitely sharper on the left iPhone, and that's less subtle. - Yeah, and then look at Mac, also a little sharper over here. We're really getting down to like (chuckles)... - I'm looking at the vent in the ceiling, and the foam, and things that aren't even the focus of the photo. I'm a guessing person right now. - Okay, he's guessing, this is completely a guess. - I'm gonna say that the midnight green one has Deep Fusion just because of the little extra bit of dynamic range, and I think it has something to do with HDR. It's taking an extra exposure, right? So I'm gonna go with Midnight Green. - Ding ding ding! - Nice. (cheering in background) - You are right. It's so crazy because like in this picture specifically, you can tell Matty looks a lot more crisp. In this photo... - [Marques] You know the filter, not filter, but the slider-- - [Justine] Clarity, and then there's also the texture one, but if you bump up clarity it also has that same sort of... But you can even kinda in here, like, in the carpet a little... - The graininess of the carpet, yeah, it's contrast-y-er. See now that I know what I'm looking for and I know which one is Deep Fusion, I'm gonna find all sorts of other things. - The carpet though, you can definitely tell in the carpet. - But you know what this says about these cameras? They're already really good. They're already much better than last year. They're already top two, arguably the best smart phone camera out right now, and that they're making it a little bit better in certain scenarios with this Deep Fusion mode, just says that computational photography is great right now, smart phone cameras are great right now, no complaints. - No, it's really great. So it says Deep Fusion is designed to use artificial intelligence and other software tricks to improve the sharpness of images by capturing frames of different exposures and merging them on its own. - Which is already what it's doing with the Smart HDR, but it's doing it a little bit more, and a little bit better. - It says it's supposed to only work for medium to low light scenes, whereas Smart HDR Night Mode handles extremely bright and extremely dark scenes. I'll be right back. - Dark photo? - [Justine] Yeah, like, I'm just gonna go over here and take, like maybe take a picture of these suitcases. - Like in a shadow area? I don't have Deep Fusion, so I can't help test it. - [Justine] Oh! - That's medium light. Here's a scientific test. - [Justine] This light looks way cooler. - It is more dramatic. There's a lot of people who adjust light like this all the time. Oh, do a shot of me with Deep Fusion so I know what I look like. - Okay, ready, okay. - Okay. - Do you remember which one is which? - I already don't, so it's perfect. It's very, very subtle. The left is sharper. - [Justine] This one looks a little warmer, too. Left? - Yeah. - Yeah, that's it. Oh my gosh, oh my gosh. - [Marques] It's so very subtle, though. But that's what software updates are in cameras. It's always subtle, like you get a good camera, you get your image processing pipeline, it's just gonna look a certain way, and from there you just do little tweaks and little things, and Deep Fusion is another one of those little tweaks. In certain lighting situations it makes it better. - This light is so moody. - So dramatic. - Should we leave it? - [Jenna] I like it. - Okay, so now we're in (chuckling) one hour night mode. - We're in the photo lab. - But yeah, I mean other than that, the phone has been pretty great. I mean I think the battery life is definitely enhanced. It's crazy because iOS 13, even if you have an older phone, it makes you feel like you have a new phone entirely. - Yeah, so iOS 13 has been great on older phones. I'm curious if you had, in the beginning, a whole bunch of bugginess. - Oh, yeah. - 'Cause I did for sure. - Definitely did. - Still in Instagram I have some bugs. - Me too, with adding the videos. - Yes. - So I can't add videos at all. - Crops are weird sometimes, and sometimes stories don't work and they've been chopped off. Yes, 13 has a bunch of improvements, and it's helped with older phones, but I also had some bugs that they're continuing to fix. They've been on like a rapid pace with that. - I think initially, it was a little rough, 'cause Jenna had probably one of the biggest problems ever, and I think she usually does have a little trouble with her iCall Backups. Do you wanna come and tell us real quick, just pop in here, say hello? - It was just stuck on like the white screen with the apple and like the status bar, so I did all the resets, I did all the recoveries, I did the DFU, but every time it reset, it just got stuck. So for like four days, incredible battery life, by the way, the phone was just on, on that screen, and there was nothing I could do. Every time I reset it, it just got stuck. - 'Cause you could still reset it, but then it was getting stuck doing the iCloud restore, which you could see in one of the updates. They had a result for that. But her phone's working great now. They ended up giving her another one, just because the phone was on for five days. - That's a pride of being in tech, is when you see a software update, and the little notes say the exact issue you had, and that's what they fixed, it was probably because of your phone. - [Jenna] They're like, \"Here's your update.\" I'm like, \"Dude.\" - I know, I mean the backup took a really long time because we were actually at camera camp in the middle of nowhere in Montana, so the internet was not the best with a bunch of tech people who just got their new iPhones, so we were all trying to do the backups. It ended up taking like six days. - [Marques] Yeah, it probably overloaded one tower in Montana. - [Justine] There was nothing around, but it was really fun, 'cause we all just got to unbox our phones together. It was like, I mean it was camera camp. That's what we were literally doing. But it was really cool. Yeah, other than that, I think everything's been good. I'm just looking forward to more of the updates. - I mean that was the main things that they wanted to fix and improve with this phone, are battery life, we've seen that. Cameras, we got 'em, they're great. And iOS, and of course the A13 Bionic, I don't know if you've seen it be faster at anything notably, but it seems fine. - Playing games, we've been playing Sneaky Sasquatch on Apple Arcade, which is the best game ever. - Should I get Apple Arcade? - For Sneaky Sasquatch, yes you should. - Okay. - I like it because I have a problem with micro-transactions, so if there's a game that wants me to do upgrades, I'm going to just kind of forget that this is real money until it actually hits my inbox, and it's like, \"What have you done?\" So just knowing that I'm paying one price to play a game, and not have to get tricked into paying for other things. - Five bucks? - $4.99, yeah. - Five bucks a month. - Which is kinda crazy. - Yeah, if the games are good, then it's worth it. - I mean I would've paid $4.99 for this game, anyway. - Oh, so it's definitely worth it. Jenna is obsessed with it, like just beyond obsessed with Sneaky-- - Sneaky Sasquatch. - Yes, do you want to see it? Jenna's further along, let's see your phone. - [Jenna] Oh gosh, I have a backpack. - It's hilarious, so like you're a Sasquatch, but you can dress like a human to try to like avoid... - How do you win Sneaky Sasquatch? - You gotta sneak around. - You sneak around? - Yeah, you sneak around so you don't get caught. (chuckling) Here it is. - Look at the splash screen. - It's so good. - Wait, this seems like a game where you just walk around doing things for fun. - Yes. - But you don't like win. - Well, we haven't got that far yet. - Okay, 'cause the description says, \"Go fishing in a lake, play a quick nine holes \"on the golf course, and eat some food.\" That's just things you can do. - So far you've done that. - [Jenna] There are tasks, though, there's like a treasure map, you have to find the pieces. - And you get a score that goes up as you do things, probably, or something, you just feel good about yourself. - [Jenna] Yeah, but Sasquatch has to go to sleep every night, so, like, if you don't go to sleep, you'll pass out, and then the ranger finds you and sends you back into the woods. It might not be for everyone. - I think it is for everyone. - Adventure style, okay. - [Justine] So she's dressed like a human right now. - [Marques] Oh, that's the Sasquatch. - [Justine] Yeah, so there he is. This is how you sneak. Why does the bear have bees by him? Does he need help? - [Jenna] You got stuck in the... - [Justine] Do you have to save him? - [Jenna] No, he's happy there. - [Justine] Oh, he's happy there? He's eating the honey, so you can go and, like, steal people's picnic baskets. So it looks like that's already empty. There's a fish! So you can put the fish in your bag, and then you're gonna go to a picnic... - Just go around robbing people? - Well, yeah, I mean you're just taking their food. It's just so you can live. You can paddle across the lake dressed as a human. So usually you have to sneak around and hide from the humans. - What happens if you get caught? - The ranger takes you back to your home, and you go to sleep. So that's Sneaky Sasquatch. I think everyone should get it. Oh wait, I gotta show you how I eat. This is incredible, okay. So you take, oh, you got a lot of food. - [Jenna] Yeah. - [Justine] Wow, Jenna's been fishing. So you just like stick it in your mouth and eat it. - [Marques] You manually have to do all of this? That's hilarious. I can imagine as they're developing this game, they're like, \"People are gonna love this feature.\" - [Justine] It's really great. - [Marques] It's gonna change everything. - I love it. So yeah, that's a iPhone 11, that we've had for three, four weeks now? - Something like that, yeah. It's the greatest phone they've ever made. - I enjoyed your iPhone 11 review, which was-- - Thank you. - Yes, it was a little late, but it was still good because I mean it's such a great phone. - Too easy, it's just the phone they obviously should make. Are you as pumped as I am about the 2020 iPhone? - Oh, man. - There's so many things, this is what I always end up talking about with every new iPhone that's come out is wow, the 2020 iPhone might have ESPC, might have Apple pencil support, maybe, might have 5G, might have a promotion 120 hertz OLED display. - Might have in screen fingerprint reader. - Might have touch id coming back, might have reverse wireless charging, might have no notch, there's all these things that it might have. - 2020's gonna be insane. - It's a great phone, but I'm looking forward to that. - Yeah, I mean we're gonna have a new Xbox next year. We're gonna have the Surface Duo and Neo. Who knows what else is coming out. - Plaid Roadster, all these things. - Oh my gosh. I'm excited. Well guys, thank you for watching. Thank you so much for being in my video. - Thanks for having me. - And I think we're gonna be doing a podcast here very shortly, so make sure you guys go check that out, if it's out, and if not, keep an eye out, or an ear out, whatever it is that you do. - That's what you should do. - Yeah, okay, bye.

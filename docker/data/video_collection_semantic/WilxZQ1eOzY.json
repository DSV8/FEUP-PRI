    "transcript": "(chiming) (techno music) - Hey how's it going? Question for you. Do you like colors? I sure do. I'm just kidding. But no, seriously, do you like colors, do you use a colored screen, a colored screen on your laptop, phone, tablet, whatever. You probably do. But, for a long time, black and white was the way to go. Especially for the early days of Mac. And that brings me to what I wanted to show you today. And I have help. Colin from This Does Not Compute is gonna be tagging along and he'll share some cool stories and facts about this computer we're going to be talking about today. So stick around. I think it's fair to say that Apple wanted to up their design game in the early 90s, because they'd been doing the same thing for quite a long time. So changing it would be good. But, while keeping it affordable and keeping it new, at the same time sounded like a good idea, it maybe came with some compromises. Enter the Macintosh Color Classic. (orchestral music) On February 10th, 1993, Apple released the Macintosh Color Classic at a price point of $1400, give or take. And with reviewers, this thing was pretty bad ass. Good job! But for customers it was a little bit of a different story. We'll come back to that in a bit. Daniele De Iuliis, he was the man behind this computer's design. Taking a closer look at the design, we can see that it is rather curvy. And there's a reason for this. You know around the 80s and early 90s Apple was using the Snow White design language but Daniel wanted to experiment with something new called Espresso, and that was the design language he made when he modeled this chassis in a CAD program. And using CAD programs to model computer chassis was pretty unheard of at the time. So using that software, he had the flexibility to make cool new design features that lasted throughout several Apple products in the 90s. So it was new, it looked pretty, it was built with a new design process. Great, it sounds amazing. Where did the flaws come into place? We're gonna talk about that right now. This wasn't really a bad Mac. It was just kind of let's say compromised. Especially on the inside. This Mac was equipped with a Motorola 68030 processor clocked at 16 megahertz. And you could also get an optional floating point processor and install it on the motherboard if you wish. The Color Classic could be expanded up to 10 megabytes of RAM and a 160 megabyte hard drive. Yeah, we used to measure things in megabytes. Just, as a reminder. In fact, most of the internals were really just directly copied from the LC, the LC II, and the Classic II. Just repackaged into a new case. On the front, we have a nice 1.44 megabyte floppy disk drive and a rather crystal clear 10 inch Sony Trinitron display. It's actually one of my favorite little displays on a compact Mac. The issue was the resolution. You see it ran at 512 by 384. And that was a limitation for programs that needed 640 by 480 resolution. 640 by 480 was huge at the time. And the 512 by 384 was just a little too much of a limitation. To put things in perspective, the original Macintosh that came out in 1984 which was nine years before this had the same resolution. But again, it wasn't all bad. It didn't mean us any harm. It still looked beautiful. Nice, new curves and nice, new designs. It had a built in speaker on the front. It had gill like vents on the side, which was actually kind of an interesting design choice by De Iuliis And Apple's iconic built in handle. Something that they do on a lot of their products. With this new design, we also have these little baby elephant feet. It kind of looks like a baby elephant walking, that was kind of the design like comparison for this thing. You got these little feet that suspend the computer up a little bit. This was a recurring design in a lot of Apple's computers throughout the 90s. And here's another thing we take for granted. Built in microphones, pretty much every Apple product has a built in microphone and they've had for a long time. This was the first Mac, actually, to have a built in microphone. In terms of accessibility, it was actually pretty easy to open this thing. Right on the back, there was this panel you could take off and get easy access to the motherboard. So with this easy access on the back, does that mean the internals could be easily swapped out and the computer could be easily souped up? Possibly. In fact, I talked with Colin from This Does Not Compute and he did something very similar. And he's gonna share with you what he did and what the community did around this little computer. I was actually kind of blown away. And after we're done taking a look at Colin's story, we'll be revealing the next photos from our show off your setup submissions. So maybe your photo made it in, maybe it didn't but you can always submit more in the future. So we'll take a look at those after the collector. Hey everyone, I'm Colin from the channel This Does Not Compute. I cover retro computing, video games, and other technology. And the Color Classic is my favorite Mac. I have a relatively small retro computer collection. Instead of trying to pick up one of everything, I instead focus on items that are unusual, unique, or otherwise just interesting to me. And the Color Classic is all three. I remember when it was released in 1993. I was able to get hands on with one of them only once in a computer store. And that makes a lot of sense considering how relatively unpopular this machine ended up being. But it wasn't until 1999 when I got a lot more time with these computers. You see at the time I was working at a computer store. And we did both sales and service. I split my time between the two. I was on the phone with our parts supplier one day and they mentioned they had happened to somehow come across a large number of these machines. And were trying to sell them off as complete units. I took 'em up on their offer, given the fact that I was in high school at the time and had a bit of disposable income. But I didn't buy just one of these. I bought two. You see I was being a little bit forward thinking. I knew just how unusual of a computer this was in Apple's history so I wanted to keep one in completely stock state. The other one though, well, there's a bit of a story to that. Around the time a bunch of computer enthusiasts in Japan had been working on ways to soup up the performance of the Color Classic. You see, as unpopular as the machine was, in say the United States, there were just a lot of other computers to be had that offered better performance and larger screens for similar prices. In Japan this machine kind of took on a life of its own. They really loved the size, the form factor of this computer. The built in 10 inch color screen. But, like the rest of the world, they were a bit underwhelmed by its performance. So they started coming up with other ways to make it faster. And part of the key was actually based on the machine's design with its slide out motherboard. A bunch of people figured out ways to rewire the machine internally to support logic boards from other Mac models that had come out even years later. And so you could have various levels of performance just based on how far you were willing to mod one of these computers. Is was in or around '99 when a lot of the web pages that they had written in Japanese started getting translated into English. And other computer enthusiasts around the world started trying their hand at doing these mods. In reading those web pages, I was hooked. It seemed really, really interesting and not too terribly daunting. Yeah, there was definitely some electrical engineering kind of work involved, but everything was documented pretty thoroughly. So the second computer that I picked up, I decided I would turn into a Power Color Classic. I spent about six months working on the project and I had my fair share of hiccups here and there. Ultimately I ran across a couple of electrical problems that I simply couldn't fix on my own. And, given my fairly hasty schedule and the fact that I was getting ready to go to college, well, I ended up dropping the project and passing the machine on to someone else who hopefully finished it. But I still kept my original stock machine. This is it. And I'm never gonna get rid of it. What makes it special to me really is not only does it encompass the era that it came out in, but it was also a major turning point for hardware design for Apple. All the machines prior to the Color Classic used the Snow White design language or some lame derivative thereof. Take a look at the IIsi or IIvx to see what I mean. But the Color Classic started a brand new language called Espresso. One that was way less slab sided, boring and boxy, and instead had more curves, compound curves. New angles, new design motifs to it that would eventually carry on into a whole bunch of other computers that Apple would make. It was certainly a polarizing machine when it first came out. From a design perspective, some people loved it and some people hated it. But I think as time has gone on, it's ended up being quite an interesting, unique, and I would say well loved machine. So, the Color Classic by far, my favorite computer. - Thank you Colin for sharing that. That was so cool man. I even learned some stuff. Before I get to the show off your setup content, I just want to quickly thank our first patrons we have ever had on Patreon. Artur15141, Joo Eduardo soares e Silva, Stephanie in Woodstock, Georgia. MatusDK12 AKA AppleOnly on YouTube. Greg Hrutkay from Hrutkay Mods. Mat Hancock, Callan Christensen, Connor McKenica, Leon Lionheart AKA digidude512. Jacobo Blandn-Pineda, Midnight, and DJ Fintan Moloney. Thank you guys so much for helping support the show and keeping our content free for other techies and for today's two show off your setup winners, we're gonna be showing a vintage Mac and a more modern Mac. The first winner is Bo, congratulations Bo. Nice looking Macintosh SE right there. We may take a look at that on a future episode. And we also have Federico Chiesa. I am so sorry if I butchered that name, I apologize, but your setup looks awesome. Those sound monitors looks awesome, nice and glassy looking. Beautiful, thank you guys so much for submitting your photos. But checkout the link in the description below and submit your own setup photos. They can be of Macs, they can be of PCs, old, new, whatever. We just wanna get your photos. When you submit them, you might get a chance to see them featured in a future episode of Vintage Apple Vault. So there you have it, the Macintosh Color Classic. It was a bit of a compromised design but it still introduced the Espresso design language which definitely influenced a bunch of future Apple products. And to put a positive spin on things, the lack of internal performance actually created a mini gold rush in a little community around souping these things up. That's gotta be worth something right? So, what's next for Vintage Apple Vault? Well, that's up to you. What other Apple products and computers would you like to see on this show? Let me know in a comment down below and I'll see what I can do for you. Also, if you're interested in helping the show continue, feel free to back us on Patreon with the link down in the description below. It helps keep the lights on, literally. That's all I have for you guys today. Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the not too distant future. (relaxing music) What's the joke this time Will? - [Will] Tickets $10 headaches free. - Yeah, 3D, all right, slay it out. Oh, oh, oh! It says TBD, I didn't finish this part of the notes. (laughing) Well, that's kind of up to you. No, it is up to you. It is up to you not kind of, all right.",

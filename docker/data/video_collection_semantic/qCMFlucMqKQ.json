Star Wars Jedi Challenges is not virtual reality but *augmented* reality  and when it launches later this year it'll let you go head-to-head with Kylo Ren, play a nasty game of holochess with your favorite Wookie, or manage major engagements full of AT-ATs! Check out MrMobile's first look from IFA 2017, and subscribe so you don't miss the Star Wars Jedi Challenges review, coming soon!

    "transcript": "- [Michael] I'm Michael Fisher and I'm living proof that you can be both a Star Trek fan and a Star Wars fan at the same time. Here in Berlin, there's not much Trek to speak of, but Lenovo did put me inside Star Wars in the form of Jedi Challenge, and it's got the potential to finally make augmented reality mainstream. This is a first look from IFA 2017. (lively electronic music) For me, the coolest thing about Jedi Challenge is that it comes with a lightsaber. OK, maybe not the coolest thing, but I love the attention to detail here. It's actually a pretty faithful replica of the Skywalker family weapon, except it's incredibly lightweight. That becomes important once you start playing the game and to do that, you slip your smartphone into Lenovo's headgear. This is cleverly engineered. You don't need to worry about whether your phone has a particular type of screen. It doesn't need to be Daydream certified or anything like that. It doesn't even matter if it's an iPhone or Android. It just needs to have Bluetooth and the Jedi Challenge app installed so it can talk to the headset, which uses twin cameras to keep tabs on two things. The tracking beacon that you put on the floor, and the light on the end of your saber. All that comes in the same kit, and when it starts shipping before the holidays it'll have a trio of games including strategic combat and Holochess. The one I got to try was a lightsaber battle with Kylo Ren, the galaxy's most dangerous emo kid. Lenovo told me it was just a 90 second demo, but man, it sure felt longer. Even though that lightsaber is super lightweight, you'd be surprised how easy it is to get winded fighting with it. Now, this is augmented reality, not virtual reality. That distinction is important because with this you can still see your surroundings. The characters are just projected in front of you using a very simple mirror trick inside the headset so there shouldn't be any of the dizziness or motion sickness that sometimes happens to VR users and parents will probably appreciate that their kids aren't totally disconnected from the world when using it. I was surprised how well everything worked in my hands-on, especially since the official release is still a few months out. The system did a good job keeping Kylo's feet on the floor where they belong, and my lightsaber blows and blocks pretty much landed where they were supposed to. Given how simple this kit is, that's pretty impressive. I mean, this is a game that you can pack up and take anywhere in a small bag. You don't have to anchor sensors to your walls or anything like the more expensive VR kits. Of course, this is also a much simpler game. Star Wars Jedi Challenge starts shipping the first week of November and it'll be a Best Buy exclusive for at least a little bit. If you want me to review it when it drops, hit that subscribe button on YouTube if you haven't already. And if you're going to buy this regardless of my final verdict, start saving now. You're looking at a buck under $200 when it debuts. Drop a comment below, tell me whether you think this is going to be the next hot toy of the holidays and check out my other takes from IFA 2017. @theMrMobile on YouTube. Until next time, thanks for watching, and stay mobile, my friends.",

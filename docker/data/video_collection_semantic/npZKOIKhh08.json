    "transcript": "Full disclosure, this is not a Hummer video. But as you know, pretty much every mounting point inside of this beast was designed using lasers. So Nebula decided to send me some lasers of their own. This is the Nebula Cosmos laser 4K portable theater. And today we're going to see how it works, maybe even from the inside. Let's get started. [Intro] The whole purpose of this Nebula Cosmos laser is to be portable. A 4K theater with a handle. With old- school projectors back in the day, they always had expensive bulbs that needed replacing. But this set up, since it's using lasers, can last for 25,000 hours. That's a lot of movies. Right out of the box this thing is much smaller than I expected with a substantial lens on the front and quite a few perforations on the side which I assume is for the cooling. We'll find out for sure in a second when we take it apart. Also in the box is a power cord, along with a remote control that has buttons for YouTube, Netflix, Disney, and Prime. So obviously, I don't watch a whole lot of movies out here in the garage. I'm usually pretty busy trying to make this Hummer electric, but, you know, it does get kind of lonely out here at night, especially when I'm not here. So I think if I throw some movies up on the wall, you know, maybe Cars 3, or Fast and Furious 27, they'll be able to give my military Humvee a little more company when he's here all alone. Because this is a portable home theater, of course it could be plugged into a wall, but I'm going to go ultra portable and plug it into my Anker 545 power house. No wall outlet needed. And according to the 545 power station, it looks like this thing can power the projector for around 3 or 3 hours. [YouTube video] Whether prehistoric or post-apocalyptic, the work must continue. -That is of course, until I also plug in the Nintendo Switch. The back of the projector has the power input HDMI USB and a headphone jack. The projector has a brightness of 2,400 ISO lumens which is an internationally recognized standard for measuring a projector's brightness. So it's a valid way of comparing the brightness between different projectors and their ability to perform in the dark. It connects with Android TV and has autofocusing, auto-aligning, and can basically set itself up in about 3 seconds. The projector also has something called iGuard, as you can see me get in front of the screen, it says to protect your eyesight please keep a distance away from the projector. Lasers can get pretty bright so it's good that there's protection involved for little kids, or you know, adults who happen to walk in front of the lens. I'm not a huge gamer or watcher of movies, not anymore than average at least, but it is super cool that there's a 4K portable theater that I can take anywhere. Sometimes it's fun to get out of the living room, blow a game up to life size, and play it somewhere you normally wouldn't. But while I might not be the best gamer, I do know how to work a screwdriver. There are 4 built in speakers, 2 ten watt full range speakers, and 2 four watt tweeters. The whole thing is designed to be mobile with a handle on top and a stand mount on the bottom. Any room, wall, or outdoor venue can become a theater including Humvee or truck beds. Taking apart the Nebula laser 4K projector was actually more difficult than I thought it would be. At first I thought the sides might snap off. Turns out that's not the case. The front as well is also not designed to come off first. Apparently there are several screws along the backside where the rear ports and plugs are. Once that's gone I can turn it around to the front and pop off the glass cover for the projector lens exposing some screws. And once those are gone, then the front plate can snap off which gives us access to the side screw covers on each side. Here we can get a look at the two cooling fans and the large heat sink behind them, as well as one of the speakers here and a tweeter. And I assume we'll find a similar setup on this side. This time around we have some... actually some pretty sweet hexagons again along with the tweeter and 10 watt normal speaker. The coolest thing is probably underneath this lens with the auto-focusing gears right down there next to the side. That's what spins around to make sure that the laser is automatically in focus when you set it down. With everything gone we can see the plastic sub frame that surrounds all the internal components and I think this is as far as I'm going to go because we can see everything we need to and I still want this thing to survive so I can use it later. Plus the more time I take taking apart the projector is less time we spend working on the Humvee. But it's still fun to glimpse the internals, something that most people don't normally get to see. And maybe since we're brainstorming possibilities, eventually we can mount it on the front of the Humvee. I'm not sure what the legality is of projecting a movie on the back of a moving semi while you're driving, but there's only one way to find out. Either way, Nebula has given us some massive discounts with the link in the description, up to $700 off, along with some sweet bundle deals like with that Anker 545 power station. Either way though, no matter where you use it, you can find the link in the description. Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.",

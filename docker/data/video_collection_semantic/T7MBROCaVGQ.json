    "transcript": "- How old is this tech item, the first motion controller. We're gonna take a look at some products and we're gonna have to try and figure out when the actual first time that this first motion controller was invented. Now it could be 2003 or whatever or it could be like 1940 when some weird one was invented. - No, no, so here, Matt, here's the thing because we're going head to head. I'm gonna be the most annoying pedantic person in the world because I'm gonna ask for so many clarifications, Kenzie, what do you mean by first motion controller? Is this for a video game? - Yes. - Is this for... Okay, video game motion controller. - All right, so I know that - Can I guess already? - I'm ready for this because if you remember I was the one who used to look this up. I'm gonna destroy you. I'm gonna say right off the bat. I don't even need to deliberate. I'm gonna say 1983. - Oh - No, no. - No, no, you said it. He said it, he said it, he said it. Is that count? I think 1983 is a close answer. However, that makes no sense because nothing came out in 1983. Either it would be NES era, which would be 85, 86, 87. I'm gonna say 1977. - Yeah. I'm gonna say 83. - The fun thing about this is that you're both right in a way. - [Unison] What? - [Austin] What? No, no, no, no. - [Matt] So, - [Austin] No, no. - The Mind link, I don't think this is considered motion control. This was mind control. (Austin laughs) And I just beat Pacman with that. I don't think the mind link is considered motion control. - No, because it used your eyebrows. It wasn't like you're using your brain wave. You're like, - It's motion of your face. - Matt. (gun blipping) I win. - But what is actually the first motion controller is this Sega heavyweight champ from 1976 was an arcade game featured a bunch of plastic boxing gloves attached to the cabinet with controls inside. Eat your heart out Mike Tyson's punch out champ. You can move up and down. You can go high, punch it. You could go low, punch it. You could push inward to punch. You just kinda go like, hiya. (explosion) Kenzie, this is a pretty simple lever action. Is this really the first motion control? - So alternatively. - Le stick. (both laughing) I'm going to beat you with le stick. - The le stick was for the Atari 2400. The controller was only made for a few games. It could detect tilt so you could play it like with pinball and stuff like that. I'm gonna argue that this is more motion control than the other one. Because on games like asteroids, where you have to push the joystick forward, it was a little awkward but it still was tilt. I think I get the point for this. - Fine. I'll concede, this is straight motion. The other one... - 10 points to Matt. - 10? - Yeah. Matt wins it with le stick. - Matt, you better stay away from le stick. - Matt has 20 points, moving on to the next one. The first Wish.com. - Well, no, no, no, no, no, no. - At time to shine, - No. - For the record, we have slide in front of us. It's just first Wish.com smiley face. I'm just gonna go ahead and grab this book here for no reason. This may or may not have been from an old version of This is which you can catch right up here. I'm just gonna be reading while you deliberate what you think your wrong answer is. - Okay, if we're strictly speaking about the actual Wish.com I'm gonna guess 2009 but if we're talking about the first scam, like BS kind of website I'm gonna just throw out a website based answer 1997. I'm just gonna say that 'cause Matt's gonna say 1884 when Sears was announced. - Let me just. - The banjos? - The banjo, From the great price maker catalog, I'm gonna go 1886. - Can I make a third guess, that does not count anyway? - Nope. - 'Cause it's gonna say it's like 1242 which is like some popper wrote out a fake like wish listing and then someone bought something. I knew it. (Austin laughing) - [Matt] But you, but I know... - Your version of wish.com is just an old complaint. - It is the oldest documented ripoff. - [Austin] This was written to a merchant named Ea-nasir. He was supposed to be sold copper ingots, however the copper was sub-standard and Nanni claimed that his servant has been treated rudely during the transaction. Just like you're treated rudely when you don't get your item from wish.com. Other tablets have been found in his dwelling including another complaining about not receiving copper. And another thing about being tired of bad copper. Matt gets no points for that because, - What are you talking? - He was thousands of years off. - I get roughly 3,574 BC points for that one because I wiped the, I floored you though. - I'm sorry to say Matt. - I was so much closer than you. - Inflation has meant that that is 0.001 point or a quarter of an copper ingot. The first touch ID? - There's a very big difference of fingerprint ID-ing and fingerprint like biometric. Those are two very different things. - So, we're gonna have to get around Kenzie's skullduggery and her shenanigans and our pedant, put, pet, podiatrist.. - Podiatrist is a foot doctor, FYI. - Pedanteria. - Do you have a foot fetish? - Maybe I need my bunions to be... (Austin laughs) I don't know what you do with feet? Anyways, foot ID. - Did you just say foot ID? Again, look you're all hearing this too, right? Do you still have those sandals from when we scammed Goodwill, which you can watch right over here? - You mean the ones that have the colon button? - Yeah. - Yes I do. All right, so first touch ID, I believe was the Motorola Atrix had a very crappy fingerprint sensor on the top of the phone that you had to like swipe and that was 2010, 20, 2011, 2011. So I'm gonna say 2011, - If we're gonna talk about purely on like a device we had laptops in the '80s with it but I'm gonna go 1600. - What the (beep) is wrong with you, Matt? What? 1600. - Medieval fingerprint recognition to get into this secret society of the Knight of the round table. You had to, to show your fingerprint, which was encased in like a resin mold which was then pressed into the ring of the table and you all press your fingers to it. And that's how... - Oh, sorry, what are you still talking? - I'm right on this. - So. - We can all be right. - [Austin] No. - [Matt] We can all be right. In 500 B.C. fingerprints were used on tablets like signatures for Babylonian business transactions. One could argue the first touch ID that is a point for Matt. Electronic remote fingerprint identification, 1916. - So the Danish police published a book on encoding single fingerprints using Morse code to detail various features. The information could then be sent to telegraphs, telephones, or radio to facilitate IDs. And the FBI was actually drawn this research to actually create computerized fingerprint recognition. So 1916 sounds a little closer but 1975 is when the first digital fingerprint scanner was created by the FBI. So 1975 was the first digital fingerprint scanner. In 1994, Lockheed Martin got the FBI contract to develop their main fingerprint ID system and was operational by 1999. The big problem with the early fingerprint sensors the digital images were so impractically huge that no one could handle a 16 kilobyte gif file on their computer. - In 2002, a Seattle supermarket became the first to use fingerprint scanning tied to debit cards as a payment method. If you want to steal your partner's credit card all you had to do was chop off their finger. Also in 2002, a Japanese hacker demonstrated how to use gelatin and digital imaging to fool fingerprint scanners with an 80% success rate. I feel like I'm right three times there because all of my answers were closer - No. - than yours. You said 2011. - Yeah, you said 1600 which means that anything past 1800 means I'm right. - We're doing price is right rules. - You just said you were gonna do that. - Still sounds like I'm... - No, three of the four answers means that I'm right. I get three quarters of a point. - Time is relative, okay? You were thinking of it like, oh, it's a modern thing. I said it was a much older thing. It's not the exact dates, it's the eras. I can think of it broad. I can see the 4D chess here that's going back eons & eras. - That mean you never played, did you? - Kenzie, do I get all 12 points? (Kenzie chuckles) Say yes and we'll move on. - Don't let him hold you hostage like that, have more faith and confidence in yourself. - How about the first touchscreen? The first touchscreen which, of course was Steve Jobs's invention because no one had ever touched a screen before Steve Jobs himself. - You do realize that things happened before the year 2000, right? - What's like the, the like laser things that would like run across a screen, so it would like detect where you would like touched it. That was actually like an '70s or an '80s invention. - I'm gonna get creative with mine. I'm gonna say in the '50s, not a actual touchscreen like this one. - Okay. - But one of those, like the, the magnetic toys where the, the pen would have a little magnet in it. - Oh, it would detect where the magnet is. - And then you draw, you can draw on it. - I will give you a decade long answer. I'm gonna say the 1970s. - '70s? Okay. - Ya. '50s versus '70s. - [Unison] 1946? - It was a stylist would add the original signal of an intermediate CRT when placed on the display which is used to draw circles and arrows over live sports broadcasts. That's pretty close, that actually sounds exactly right. And then the next one. - [Austin] Ooo. 1965 was the first finger driven touchscreen. Your finger is the conductor and it disrupts the capacitance of that top layer to essentially show where the touchscreen is being used. I could argue pedantically, podiatristly that the finger driven touchscreen was the actual one in 1965. I'm gonna give this to you, Matt. - I'm gonna say I am the most correct but I think I'm gonna give you the point for this one because yours' is the most moderately accurate. - Are you giving me a pity point for being kind of okay on this one? - No, I just feel like arguing with you so like it's... - What? You can't even let me give it to you. - Fine, 50 points to Matt. - Anyway while Matt is even more wrong is the first touchscreen phone was actually in 1994. It was the IBM Simon personal computer. It was a decade ahead of its time. It was actually kind similar to something like an Apple Newton or maybe like a cellphone or maybe even like a Palm. However, it could receive faxes, emails, had an address book, calculator, notepad with a solid hour of battery life. - So, I like how you said it was like all those things but all of those things that you said it was like use stylists. So, point to Matt. - Like? I'm gonna throw a foot at you. (Matt laughs) - [Austin] Oh God. - [Matt] The first online game? 1976. - Care to elaborate? - No. (Austin laughs) Cause I am taking a wild shot in the dark with this one. - 1976, okay so, I mean my first thought is something like Doom or Quake but that's way too late, right? It's gotta be something early. It's gonna be one of those like MIT, like... - I vaguely remember something like pong or something that was able to be played... - You say 1976? - I'm gonna say 1976, I, I do not know like... - 1965 to be contrary - [Matt] Corresponding chess, the Byzantine empire. So were they just mailing each other like... - C2 to C5 or whatever. - Back and forth that had to have taken years to play? - Well, it's okay because they were rulers and they could have their minions go back and forth. - Did they go to war over this game of chess? - That's actually true, I'm just gonna tell you right now. - So we'll get a little bit more realistic and reasonable. - [Unison] Space War. - [Austin] 1962. - [Matt] A two player space dog fight was meant to demonstrate the technical capabilities of the PDP-1. - This was using two players on one CRT, so it was basically split screen more so than online gaming. - So while originally it was all on the same CRT which is not online, there was a small group of programmers who were able to port it over to Plato which was early form of the internet. - [Austin] Basically they could log into a powerful mainframe. - [Matt] Yeah. - [Austin] And borrow that computing capability on what was a much less powerful system. - So I remember reading about this. - Yeah. - Which is why I said 1976. I totally guess at this one, but I had, I did remember reading about this. - I think. - I think you get the point 'cause you said the '70s like that's when it was actually online. - I said '60s, you said '70s. - Oh, then I get the point 'cause I'm right. - This is like an actual fair Matt point. - [Austin] Yeah. - Fair Matt point, which is, is worth triple, right? - So wait, what's the score now? - So if we add up all the points cause we haven't been keeping track I'm pretty sure it is 140,000 to two. - Two and a half. - Let's know who you think won this competition. I believe it's Matt but I could have mathed wrong, so... - You might have been off by a couple thousand years. - Let's know in the comments of some other tech you want us to take a look at and see how old that actually is. Take a look at some of our older versions of these videos. They were a really fun time. Like, subscribe, follow everywhere. And we will catch you in the next one. - Where I will podiatristically... - No more feet. (Austin laughs) (upbeat music)",

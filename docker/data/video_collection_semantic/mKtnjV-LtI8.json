    "transcript": "- Hello, and welcome to This Is. Razer is no longer just a gaming company. - Yes, they make phone cases now and also laptops that don't game, even though it actually will game, but don't worry about that part. - So this is the Razer Book. This is their first non-gaming laptop. I know it's hard to kind of grasp that. I know it's hard to wrap your head around this, but this right here is not a Razer Blade Stealth. It is not a Razer Blade, it is not any type of gaming laptop, whatever, this is the Razer Book 13. - There's a few things that make the Razer Book 13 different from something like, what I would say is a very good but slightly expensive option, the Razer Blade Stealth. So this laptop is much more meant for gaming. So you have options like a 120 Hertz display. You have that 1650 Ti dedicated graphics. It's a little bit bigger. But this really is their small, portable, thin and light gaming laptop. - And this was my daily driver for a hot minute and I really enjoyed it. And so I got really excited for the Book. And so I've been playing with this now for a couple of days. I like it, but, dot, dot, dot. - But, make sure you subscribe to This Is to find the full thoughts that Matt has on this particular product. So the main thing is the Razer Book is a little bit smaller, so it's about 10% or so smaller than the Blade Stealth, which makes sense because it does lose that dedicated graphics. It also has a taller 16 by 10 aspect ratio display, which is nice. But the main differences between these two laptops really come down to who is going to be using it. So obviously the colors are different. There are some advantages on this. So this actually has a full-sized HDMI port, something that the Blade Stealth oddly doesn't, which you would think the gaming laptop would have HDMI, but it just doesn't. - Yeah, so the Book is meant to be a productivity laptop. The Blade Stealth is obviously a gaming laptop. There's the trade-offs, which are towards productivity with that 16 by 10 aspect ratio, gives you a little bit of extra vertical screen real estate for something like, I don't know, spreadsheets or web pages. - Productivity, it's spreadsheets. There's no such thing as anything that's not spreadsheets. - I mean like that's most of my job is spreadsheets and text. - We should just say, this is a pre-production sample that Razer sent over early, right? So this laptop will be going on sale at some point in November. - Correct. - However, what we're playing with right now is not representative. So things like benchmarking, we couldn't do. There's a bunch of like small things. And this is very much a prototype laptop. So take some of this stuff with a little bit of grain of salt until we actually spend time with the final retail unit. But there are some key takeaways. First of all, it's a nice place to be for productivity, right? The keyboard's nice, trackpad's nice, touchscreen's nice. - It's one of my favorite keyboards on a laptop, I really enjoy typing on it. Oddly enough, I didn't love the trackpad, which is weird because it kind of feels like a MacBook track pad, but the drivers for it just aren't quite as good there. I do like the- - Pre-production, pre-production. - It is pre-production, maybe I'll like it better. But the Blaze Stealth has definitely a smoother trackpad. So I kinda like it better on the Stealth, but the keyboard, fantastic on this. - And something that actually is an improvement over the Razer Blade Stealth. This has per-key RGB, whereas this is just zone RGB. So that's nice, so you can really kind of customize, of course you have the full Razer Synapse and everything. I'll also say that while I'm always partial to the matte black, the, what is it? Something silver. - Mercury silver. - It's nice. - It's a really nice looking finish here. However, this one does kind of scuff up a little bit more. This is still a really heavy laptop for the size. - Yeah. - So it's three pounds. This feels like a brick compared to anything else. - It's still a chunky laptop, right? So it is a little bit smaller than the Razer Blade Stealth. But it's still got that squared off design that Razer's pretty much always used on their laptops. At least for the last few years. If you put it side by side with something like an XPS 13, it is still a much sort of chunkier device. But that being said, while yeah, you can't like tilt it and flip it, this does have the optional touchscreen. So there are actually three configurations. We'll get into price in a minute, but there's three. So there's a base model with a Core i5, eight gigs of RAM, 256 gigs storage, that does not have a touchscreen. This is the mid spec model, which has the i7, touchscreen, 16 gigs, 512. And then there's a final model, which has all those same specs, but also with a 4K touchscreen. Now I'm never a huge fan of the 4K displays on laptops of this size. - No, I think this was the perfect sweet spot. So this is a 1900 by 1200, for that 16 by 10 aspect ratio. I never once felt like I needed the extra screen real estate with a 4K. One thing to note with the internal storage, so that is user upgradable. If you want to go to like something like a terabyte or two terabytes, you can easily swap that out. - But you do have to swap the drive out. Whereas some other Razer laptops, you have multiple bays, you only have one, but that's fine. Now as far as specs, that is where these two laptops really differ. So the Razer Blade Stealth right now does have 11th Gen processors available. We actually have not tested any of that yet. You're looking at the 11th Gen processor. So you do have a Core i5 available for the first time. In fact, I was actually kind of surprised, this is the first time Razer's ever offered a Core i5, it's always been i7s as far as I know. Now they do have the Intel Xe graphics. Now this promises a huge jump in gaming performance. So obviously they're still integrated graphics, but it should in theory, get a lot closer to some of the low-end Nvidia graphics. - The most popular games this year are not exactly the most intensive games to run. So I very easily played like, Fall Guys, Among Us. I had played Minecraft with no problem. You guys know me, I like the cloud gaming. So I was able to play a lot of cloud gaming on this just fine. So if you did wanna play small games, this works. The Xe integrated graphics, this is my first time using it and it worked surprisingly well. - I wanna do a much deeper dive on that and we'll probably actually do that on the main channel so make sure you're subscribed, but essentially, very early impressions are promising, but because this is prototype hardware, we really can't benchmark it. So of course you do only have the 60 hertz display. So there are still a lot of gaming functions that are better on the Blade Stealth, but I know that when I was using a Blade Stealth as my daily, I didn't really do a lot of gaming on it, I liked it for all the reasons that make this a solid device. And plus this has much thinner bezels, right? So that's part of the reason why they were able to get the smaller footprint. You also do have those upward firing speakers. And I know I briefly mentioned it before, but the port selection is really solid. A pair of Thunderbolt 4 ports on either side, both of which can be used to charge the laptop. You have a full-size USB-A 3.2 Gen 2. It's got a fast USB-A port. You also have a Micro SD, which is maybe not the most important thing in the world, but it's nice to have. And HDMI 2.0, which is very nice to have. Again, this is pre-production, so while we've seen good battery life, you really can't judge that until you get the final unit. - Yeah, but I will say even with that, I've had really good battery life with this. - Oh, and I guess it should go without saying, but some laptops are now dropping this. It does also have a 3.5 mil jack. Good job, guys, don't get rid of that ever, please. Now, when you look at this device, it's interesting to think about Razer making a non-gaming laptop. And you would think with non-gaming laptops, you would have non-gaming laptop prices. However... Okay, it's a little bit pricey. So the base model, again, just to refresh, Core i5, non-touchscreen, eight gigs of RAM, 256 gig storage, $1,200. Not egregious, of course, this still has a CNC aluminum chassis. - Yeah, the build quality, it kind of matches at $1,200, but at only eight gigs of RAM and 256 gigs of storage. - It's a little bit much. - That's a little bit much. And for not that much more, you can go to the gaming version. - Yes. The next step up, and this is the one that we're using, it's $1,600. Now, i7, 16 gig, 512 is all great, but that's a pretty big jump. And if you wanna go to the 4K touchscreen, it is $2,000. That's a lot of money. And if you compare that to the Blade Stealth, which of course is still sticking around, you can choose either of these laptops, the Blade Stealth gives you stuff like a 120 Hertz display and dedicated graphics for not that much more. And this was already a quite expensive laptop. I think for both of us, like if you kind of throw the money out of the window, there's a real argument that this is one of the best sort of like, Ultrabook productivity laptops around. There are certainly advantages here, but you're certainly having to pay for that, which means that this is a great laptop in many ways, but is it gonna be worth that 1,600 bucks realistically, to get that decent spec? - I think they should have started at 16 gigs of RAM. Have the two models be 16 versus 32 gigs of RAM. Do something a little bit more as far as like productivity, more RAM, more tabs, more apps open, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Versus the 120 Hertz screen. At 1200 bucks, if you were getting like 16 gigs of RAM, something that's a lot more compelling than it is now. I think I would still go for the Blade Stealth just in case I ever wanted to game in the future. - And the nice thing is because you have those Xe graphics, you can do light gaming. And for me, if I can do a little bit of light gaming every once in a while, that's all I would ever want. And I like the 16:10 display. I like the smaller design, I like the per-key RGB backlighting, I like the battery life. For me personally, this is a laptop that I would strongly consider using as my daily. But I think for a lot of you, the Blade Stealth is still probably where it is at. - I think this is the first time that you and I have ever swapped our opinions. I would go for the 120 hertz model, you would go for the 60. It's always the other way around with us. - I love 120 hertz, but I will say in a laptop, I don't care quite so much about it. I find for me, it's more important on like phones and tablets and stuff. - I am spoiled and I still want 3:2 for all my laptop aspect ratios moving forward. - I was going into this, spending a little bit time. Obviously, you've been mostly dailying the Book. I was like, this thing is great, but it's too expensive, I think I'm gonna pass. The more we talk about it, the more everything that you're saying about this is like, yeah, that's what I want, that's what I want. I don't know if I can recommend this to you. I think you have to be a very specific kind of person, but I actually think the Book is kind of the Razer laptop for me. - Yeah, I see that. Realistically, if I didn't game on my laptop ever, I would be in the same boat. It's cool that there are options. I just wish that there was a little bit more to separate these two product lines. - It's just in typical Razer fashion, a little bit too expensive, which makes sense 'cause these things are very expensive. Like, I think I talk about this every Razer video we do, the chassis on something like a Blade Stealth or a Book because it is a solid block of CNC aluminum that pretty much only Apple does, that is a very, very expensive process. And while sure, it might not be quite as small and thin and light as some other devices, you get that incredible sort of solidity and it feels cool to the touch. Like, there's something to be said about one of those whole fresh new Razer laptops right out of your bag in the morning. It's an inspiring place to be. I sound like a sell out right now. But you know how I can really sell out? By reminding you to subscribe to This Is for lots more videos all about my questionable tech purchases. Thank you very much for watching. Until next time, we are not sponsored by Razer. And I think the laptops are too expensive, but they're still pretty good, right? - I love them but... Yeah, send us a check. - Wait, no, that's the opposite, we're not supposed to do that, we're impartial, unbiased reviewers. - Yeah, but I still want a check. - Oh.",

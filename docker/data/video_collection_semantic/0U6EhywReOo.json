    "transcript": "Hey everyone, in this video I want to talk about something I try to stay away from nowadays I have tried filming this like a hundred times and I'm not even sure how I want to word it because no matter what I say there are still going to be folks who say oh you're just doing this for the Views for the clicks you like the drama but I really have tried to stay away from that especially in the past few years the channel really hasn't had to rely on drama negativity there's a lot of channels that already do that kind of stuff and I just I just think it's so hollow there's no real substance there I mean hearing you rant for 20 minutes in a talking head video it's just that's not it's not what I want this channel to be about that said there has been a bit of negativity a bit of a misunderstanding about the kind of submissions we accept why we accept those kinds of submissions only and why we just don't have more time and that's that's really what it comes down to I want to talk about that I also want to switch gears at the end of this when I talk about a pretty sweet giveaway that I'm just running myself it's an RTX 3080 and I'm only requiring you to comment on an Instagram (@GregSalazarYT) post you got to follow (@GregSalazarYT)me so that you can be dm'd so I you know I get something out of it but at the end of the day all you need to do is follow me on Instagram and comment and that's it, you're entered to win the accounts that are posting 10 or 20 comments at a time or more to try to bump their odds those are filtered out so there's no point spamming it we also check to make sure the account has been in good standing and existed for a certain amount of time but apart from that that'll be pretty sweet too we'll talk about at the end stay with me if you're on the hunt for RAM (Pc Memory) or Storage check out TeamGroup's black friday and cyber monday sales happening this month Find great deals on your favorite Delta RGB and Vulcan Z memory and even ultra fast PCIe 4.0 cardia SSDs Each monday a new promotional discount will be running for average savings of around 15% so be sure to click the link below to stay informed happy shopping so yeah I'm sitting on the floor of my office because I just I don't know this just feels it it's it's weird talking about this I don't want to sit at the desk and talk about drama just doesn't feel right I want the desk to be where we film serious content stuff that I think is informative and entertaining and and the best kind of content in my opinion is when you can mesh both beautifully I think that the Fix or Flop and PCDC Series do a pretty decent job combining those two although there are folks clearly who already know about all the stuff that we talk about here and they just maybe find it entertaining or what have you that's why I always try to put some kind of entertaining factor into the videos I try to be a bit charismatic and a bit lively but at the end of the day if you don't like the videos I can't please everyone now other folks who apparently can't be pleased no matter how cordial I am because I'm the one doing most of this folks who submit their systems for cleanings or to be fixed I'm going to read this one to you I'm not going to disclose this person's name (Thumbs up this video for Male Karen) or email or any of that crap that's not the point of this but I just want to show you where the misconception lies and hopefully use this video as a buffer in the future for other folks who expect what this gentleman expected he said \"Hey Greg, my name is\" i'll admit the name \" and I'm one of your subscribers uh my pc is having problems every time I play games such as apex legends or call of duty the whole pc would crash which leads to a boot error I tried resetting the M.2 drive\" he tried doing a few other things and it basically didn't work out for him he says he lives in the Orlando Florida area which is good because that's one of the main criteria for being eligible for this playlist he then follows up with PC Specs which is great that's what I asked for he includes his personal address I'm not sure why he did that I didn't ask for that but anyway he sends some pictures and that's great and all now here's my response because I read his symptoms and like I have to be very choosy here because we have many many people applying to have their systems fixed I said \"Hi there unfortunately, we don't have time to put these systems under load and wait for symptoms to show up these issues need to be readily repeatable and we can't risk having a system potentially fail to show errors after hours of operation\" Now, the reason why I do this it's not because I want people to hate me it's not because I want to disappoint Viewers it's because I I don't have time like I said I don't have time to let these systems sit and cross my fingers hoping that the symptom you're describing randomly shows up the reason why we pick PCs that primarily don't POST or don't turn on at all are because those symptoms are readily repeatable I can try turning the system on and I get a result right away whereas in this case where you're saying that your game sometimes crashes um you know when like it does it always happen after five minutes of gaming does it happen sometimes two hours after gaming sometimes it never happens I I can't risk having a system like that show up and and never exhibit the symptom you know I have to pick systems that have immediate issues and this just it's not one of them if this person was the only person to submit an inquiry maybe yeah I would give it the time of day maybe I can afford to let it sit on the table for hours until something happens but because we have so many inquiries and frankly so many systems that have worse issues than the one this person's describing I have to prioritize those now to be fair a lot of folks who receive this reply from me are understanding they know that you know we have a lot on our plate there are a lot of inquiries and we have to pick the ones that are the most severe but this person responded with a rather inflammatory sentence he said what the He 11 I told you the symptoms so you guys can't like remote into my pc and see the issue I'm having he said that by this point I hadn't even responded to his message he replied again he said you gotta have text that can remote into my system to see the issue like isn't that what help desk is supposed to do now it says help desk here because that's what I call this email account so whenever I reply to somebody the signature at the bottom is help desk but just because it's called help desk that doesn't mean I can always help you with whatever issue you have and I love how this person assumes that I have like a ton of text working for me I'm a one-man show dude I do literally all of the work that goes into each of these videos apart from sourcing a lot of the advertisers which we have a Brand Manager for and apart from responding to some of the PCDC emails which my wife does or she she was doing we just had our our second child our baby girl and so she's super busy with her now and so I don't want her touching any of the work that I do here I just I want her focusing on the kids while I'm upstairs now by this point I did respond and I I really had to bite my tongue uh I I wanted to just give them the metaphorical middle finger I mean that's that's that's how I am usually I just dish back what I receive but I you know you got to stop and think about what you represent you are not only representing yourself but also your business and I understand that this person could take this email this reply that I could send him and throw it up on Reddit or something else without context and I could be ostracized for it i've seen it happen many times before and so that's that's why I had to be very steadfast with my responses and I had to be very patient when normally in real life if it's just me in a confrontational situation to be perfectly honest with you I would have completely dished back everything tenfold that this guy threw away me (Subtitle Man Can Confirm) anyway I took the high road and I said \"Hi there, just so we're clear you're dealing with a free service here we are under no obligation to fix anything if we think we can help then we do however if we suspect the required troubleshooting will take much longer than the window of time we have available per project especially in the case of random non-repeatable shutdowns and BSODs that's Blue Screens of Death, then we respectfully pass now a bit of my personal self did kind of squeak into this email I ended it with don't be ungrateful because again this is a free service I feel like that was justified some of you might not think so but whatever I I said it because I did feel it in the moment and I stand by what I said and boy oh boy did we get a handful from this gentleman then you guys are a joke and you guys call yourselves help desk and fyi I'm not ungrateful i'm having problems with my system and you're telling me you can't help me because you guys feel it would take too long to troubleshoot some tech company you guys are so again this roots back into the misunderstanding about what this is and what I do here I film videos that is at the core of what I do on YouTube okay you have to film stuff to put it up on YouTube so that's that's the meat and potatoes okay and and the content around it the content that I film that goes into each of these videos is kind of like the icing right a cake sucks without icing I could upload garbage videos that's cool and all but nobody's gonna want the cake because it's not sweet so it's important that I sculpt my content around what you all want to see my core audience the folks who return for every single upload right you are who i'm trying to keep happy at the end of the day because if you come back and watch the videos and leave great feedback my Advertisers are happy and the world goes round and round right but if the opposite is true if you don't watch my videos why would Advertisers advertise and then I lose money the channel dies and I move on to something else in life but I am not a Tech Support Company that's not what I do I do this as kind of an exchange for giving me access to content right folks who drop their systems off are getting a free service but i'm also getting something pretty substantial out of it i'm getting content content that I can monetize so that's the prid the prid the quid pro quo that's the exchange right there's this for that and most folks are understanding of that but it it's almost like this person thinks I I don't know run a store on a on the corner of a busy I don't know intersection and i'm just looking for anything and everything to fix or to work on that's not what this is okay I have to hand pick because I have so many people wanting their systems fixed and this isn't the only thing I do I do other things here on this channel it's not like i'm only a tech support channel I've never called myself that and I don't think I'll ever turn into just that so my response was pretty much what I just told you you're confused we aren't a PC Repair company this is a YouTube channel, we do quite a bit more than just repair PCs for free if you think we're a joke then why are you here asking for help we wish you the best of luck and the grand finale from our gentleman here that's all it says so of course me being me I replied with \"Hi there, okay\" This is the most extreme case of this I have had a few others respond again not as extreme as this but it's been kind of up the same alley where it's you know they're disappointed and they're they're they don't understand that there's just one of me I don't know they feel like because they've submitted an inquiry therefore I owe them all the time in the world they think that I can fix their systems over the air or with teamviewer or whatever they think that I can like call them and walk them through these steps I don't have time for that and so I I have to be I have to look out for myself because what I do here puts food on on my table for my family and as much as I want to be a nice guy i'm just i'm not a charity i'm not I you know I just I I don't know why I even need to say that to be frank so yeah this person left upset and you know what what can I do but just because you submitted inquiry doesn't mean that first off you're even going to get a response we have an automated response for the first couple of emails that you send and then after that if I think that you're either sending way too many because you just want my attention or maybe maybe the opposite is true maybe you've submitted stuff and you look like a viable candidate then i'll respond to you or maybe i'll respond and say hi i'm I got to block you because I i'm getting way too many messages from you and I need to filter these out from the rest you know we've told you just to leave one or two emails with all the info we've asked for and that's it and then please be patient with us if we get to you we get to if not there's nothing we can do but because of this because of issues we've had like this where again there's just this misunderstanding we've actually had to move to a form and that form will submit your info it'll log it into an excel sheet and from there we'll be able to see who qualifies and who doesn't I really wanted this to be more of a personal experience where you could message me and I could respond if the issue is you know bad enough or maybe it's not bad enough but at least I can tell you that hey sorry it's just it's not something we can do this was me messaging this guy this entire time my wife didn't see this i'm glad she did I didn't want her to deal with anyone like this to begin with but um that was my goal was just to be a little a little more personal with folks and unfortunately I've had to move away from that because of issues like this I just I don't I don't have the time of day to deal with folks who don't understand that this is not a charity and there aren't a hundred of me so the form is there it should be up for all of our previous Fix or Flop and PCDC videos and each one of those videos going forward in case you're wondering why we moved away from the email system if you send an email to one of those now it's just going to be ignored because we use the marketing email for marketing stuff and we use the help email now for responses to those form submissions so don't expect a reply if you send an email to any of those we just want you to use the form i'm sorry that it's had to come to that but we kind of had our hands forced and now to end this video on a high note because I don't want to end it just buried in drama the Instagram post that you guys should click on if you want to enter the RTX 3080 giveaway is linked in this video's description all you need to do is click on it leave a comment and then follow so that I can DM you if you happen to win I can tell your odds relatively speaking are going to be pretty high at least as of time of filming because only a few thousand people have entered and usually when you see like gleam giveaways and things there's like there's dozens of ways to enter those and so that can really screw up the odds and things so on Instagram it's very isolated I get something out of it by you following and engaging in that post and yeah it's just a small way for me to give back to you guys especially in this current climate where graphics cards are freaking expensive so thank you for your support on that platform thank you for watching this far in this one and for supporting us here on youtube and I suppose I'll catch you in the next one my name is Greg thanks for chatting with me.",

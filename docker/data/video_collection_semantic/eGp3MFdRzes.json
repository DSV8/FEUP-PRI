    "transcript": "- Hey, how is it going, long time, no chat. I mean, I've chat with you guys all the time, but not like this, not vlogging. I haven't vlogged in so long, I haven't picked up a camera and held it at myself like this, in a very, very low time. But I've forgotten everything. So today we already shot a couple of videos, and I was just sitting at my unboxing station and I thought, I don't like this anymore, I'm done, I don't wanna set, I don't, I don't wanna do this, it's time, it's new, it's 2021, time for change. So now I have to go tell Tyler that, that's on the agenda. I think he thought that we were done filming today. Tyler hi, what's up? - I'm archiving everything on my Instagram because it's new year and. - [Justine] New year, new you? - New year new me. - Maybe auto ISO is a lil too bright. So you were too bright. - Stop. - [Justine] Stop doing everything am doing? - Stop doing the lens a little bit. - [Justine] No, cause I look how bright this is, right. That's a little too bright. - Could also, I don't know. - We're learning about vlogging. Yeah, that's too bright. Hold on. (beep) I fixed it. My God, look at this, this is so much better. - You're so close to me. - [Justine] Look at this microphone. I think the brand is called DD. - [Tyler] DD, yeah. - DD. - [Tyler] I have heard about them and (laughter) I wanna try. - Well, we're trying it right now. So it's cool because there's two kind of microphones. There's a front and a back. So when I'm talking here, or when I'm talking over here, like I'm getting the behind, - [Tyler] I'm talking you - [Justine] Yeah, but I'm back here too. - And I'm talking - Tyler! - [Tyler] Yeah - So we've been shooting together for a long time. - [Tyler] Yeah, yeah - Like what, two years, two years, two and a half. - Basically two. (laughter) - That has nothing to do with what I was gonna say. We are, how do you feel about, my stomach's grumbling? - I heard that. - Oh my God, I'm so starving. It's a good thing that we ordered food because I think that we might need some nourishment, for this evening's task. I know that like the setup is pretty much perfect, like lighting looks great, like we got a new. - It's all right. - It's all right. - It's all right. - Oh really, I'm glad to hear you say that because how about we completely redo it again? - What a spontaneous great idea that you just had. - It's crazy, like I didn't plan this or anything, like I had no idea that this was gonna happen. - Fun - My initial idea was to shoot from like this direction, but I don't think that's gonna work. - And then I liked your second idea better where we go that way, toward the entryway, because that gives us even a little extra depth. - We close the bathroom door, throw a plant over there, - [Tyler] Put a light up there in the hallway. - One of the things that we've been doing recently, is we've actually been using this as a podcasting desk, So we've just kind of swing things off to the side, when we're doing unboxing, and then when we do podcasts, we just go like that, and time for pod. Oh gosh, I'm stressed out, What do we do first? - Move everything. - I haven't vlogged in so long, like my arms tired. Ooh my gosh, I'm so, so tired, this is heavy. - First, We clean everything out of here that is not a part of the shooting setup. Sometimes we accumulate some mess. - I feel personally attacked. - That was a personal attack. (laughter) - It could not have been any more personal or direct. I am disgusting. Okay, We do this now. Vlogging feels weird, this feels like, I'm liking it ,I missed it. This is fun. Look at this authenticity. (laughter) - Is this screen is so wide or this TV so heavy? You gonna hit the door, I love it. - [Justine] It's 75 inches. (mumbling) All of it it's got to go. - All of it it's got to go. - All of it it's got to go. Cause I also kind of have like this vision, Like chairs, like the vintage ones, they're like, kind of like an emerald color, Like I have it in my mind. It's like, like a green, like you would see it, like in your grandmother's house or something. Like an arm chair. - [Tyler] Big arm chair? - Kind of like, if I actually get a book, I'm like a bourbon. Like this is what I would picture myself sitting at. I have never even had bourbon in my life, I don't even. - [Tyler] Like this? - Yeah, like something like that will work. Like little. - [Tyler] Little buttons? - Buttons. Like a little, you would see in the library. - Oh, like this. - Yeah there, like that. But like it in a green, and then like accent with like some pinks, and some gross gold. Oh beautiful, love it. - Everything's got to go. (claps) - Everything's got to go, everything's got to go. (vacuum cleaner buzzing) - You will go that way. - I will go that way. - You go that way. - I will, I'll go this way. - Yeah, yeah. - The whole way? - Yeah. (paper crumpling) (door bangs) (screams) - Things are coming along nicely, we've got clean floor. So we got this new aperture light, pretty excited about it. It's actually pretty cost-effective, which is kind of incredible, because usually a lot of studio lights are pretty expensive. So this is the 200D, and then what's this, this is the oldest of 120D. New boy, smaller, dome, larger dome. Hi, how are you doing? You hate it, you hate it, yeah? - I think you. - Me, sit? - Need to move this desk for me. - Okay, I move the desk. - I needed to get her head in the space there instead of, yeah okay, yeah. - The order I think has been delivered to the door. (feet thumbing) (chuckles) Be careful when you walk out of here because there's a tree. - [Tyler] I'll walk, I won't run like an animal. - You don't do it, like this is. (plant clattering) The food, the food, the food. I will light it up by my beautiful garden. I got a nice salmon. What do you got there, is it a little Butternut Squash Delight? Yeah? - Yeah. - [Justine] Yeah, yeah. Do you guys remember when I used to vlog every single day? You don't remember that time. - [Tyler] I've seen some of it though. - Like there's not, like they are keeping a daily vlogger, that's like, I am happy. (box clattering) - [Tyler] No, cause then they all inevitably complain about it. - Well, I don't know, that could be. (laughter) - I get like, can't do it anymore. - It's hard, it's very, very hard. Props to people that still do it and can do it and are happy. Play Chill Out radio on Pandora. Hey, I listened to Pandora on my home pod. - [Siri] Chill out radio now playing on Pandora. - What is it like, 2002? (box shuffling) What if we can time travel? What if we are time traveling? What if we have time traveled? - [Tyler] I'll definitely wouldn't go back to 2002. - I wouldn't either. - I'd go back before civilization, free newspapers. (box shuffling) - I'm just gonna make a little coffee, just a little coffee. (coffee machine grinding) (dramatic music) Okay wow, we're back. - Just turn on a backlight, here we'll add some. - Okay, okay, hear me out. I just feel like we need more of nature - It's not the worst thing, but it's just kinda. - We just need to move this like over here (mumbling) (laughter) - [Tyler] It looks like a school play. - Ooh shit. All right, okay (plant rattling) I mean where do you think? - [Tyler] On the balcony. (laughter) - [Tyler] So big. - No, no they are small. Do you hate it? - [Tyler] Yeah, I'm so sorry. Okay you can come back. - It looks cool. - [Tyler] I actually don't hate the plant there. - I will take it the other way, because now it looks like it's something out of my head. Maybe turn yours on first. (laughter) Okay here we go. - [Tyler] The beginnings of a setup. - It is, we've already done a lot. I know, like why don't we, we should move it to this camera. (laughter) and then I think for podcast, we just, everything can be dark in the back. Tyler hates this tree. - [Tyler] And then look, it's just like in the place where you would never put, it's kind of just like blocking that hallway. Is there a way to just turn these two lights on? - Yeah. - [Tyler] That's exactly what I wanted. - So hold on a second. - [Tyler] We gotta turn these ones off though. - Okay. - [Tyler] They're not off. That looks so nice. - It does look good, I like it. It looks cool. - You gotta look in the interview finder too. - [Justine] Yeah look at that, Tyler. - Hey, what up YouTube. - You hate the tree. I feel like now the tree look like it give little light. - [Tyler] I don't wanna like the tree. - You hate the tree, Tyler hates the tree. - [Tyler] If the tree is there, I think it's lit enough right now. Like it is lit. - Where have you seen the duct tape, tell me. you can tell, that I have taped the outlet. Yeah, there's no way, I can't even see with my own all eyes. - [Tyler] I say we go with this background for now. - Yeah, I like it, All right, we did that, more to come. I like that light in the back, it looks a bit like the, that skylight. - [Tyler] Yeah, that's nice. And that's the RGB thing, so. - Is that just the one by one? That's nice. Oh, you're stuck. - [Tyler] You good? - Yeah. A new set who dis. This is my first video actually shooting here in the new set, so I'm super excited about it. (upbeat music)",

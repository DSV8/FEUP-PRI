    "transcript": "Sometimes less is more sometimes you don't need a discreet gpu for quality gaming sometimes all you need is a beefy APU. This is the AMD Ryzen 5 5600G and we've partnered with AMD to discuss its architecture and capabilities in this video and spoiler* it packs one heck of a punch for the price we wouldn't be doing this making this video if that wasn't the case. See, in a world where graphics cards are in high demand and most of us are well at least on some kind of reasonable budget releases like these are quite refreshing not only do they not break the bank at least relatively speaking they're also widely available chances are you can hop online and buy one right now without having to deal with crazy price gouging now that seems like a weird pro in 2021 but it is what it is so knowing that going into this i'd say the 5600g is a pretty darn good place to start uh for an entry-level gaming pc as it is relatively attainable in relation to most discreet graphics options out there now as for architecture and features let's start with the basic architectural layout and its advantages over previous APUs so AMD recently released two 5000 series APUs we have the 5600g this one here and the Ryzen 7 5700g. Now the 5600g if you ask me is the more i think this is the more value bang for the buck option it's got six cores 12 threads base frequency of 3.9 gigahertz max 4.4 and 19 megs of cash the 5700g on the other hand bumps things up to 8 cores and 16 threads we're talking cpu cores here and a max frequency of 4.6 gigahertz and 20 megabytes of l3 cache TDPs are identical and both have unlocked multipliers for added fun if you're into overclocking no overclocking tax you'll need to pay with either of these but apart from the obvious cp core disparity there's really only one other small difference physically between these two and that's the number of compute units see the 5600g here has seven of these and these are essentially dedicated graphics course the 5700g has eight along with a slightly higher frequency and we'd expect performance to scale roughly in line with this number so not a huge disparity in graphical horsepower though we'd expect the 5700g to have a distinct advantage in other multi-threaded applications like say video editing streaming and encoding also bear in mind that these chips are reliant on zen 3 architecture for their cpu cores which means you'll enjoy a healthy latency reduction over that of previous ap generations thanks to unified l3 cache and an 8 core per ccx right meaning core to core communication need not travel across the infinity fabric first this ultimately translates to more efficient processing time and higher frame rates in games all other things equal less latency equals good now as we just mentioned AMD decided to send us the 5600g which i would have opted for anyway seeing as though it is the more attainable chip without too large a compromise in the graphics department on paper and with it in the box you'll find a stealth cooler which can help keep the budget in check when building a system you don't need to spend any extra for an extra cpu cooler the rig we've put together also won't break the bank again relatively speaking you wanted to balance things out does it make sense to pair a thousand dollar platform with a chip like this so it is quite balanced and i think it still packs quite the punch for 720p and 1080p modern gaming so let's see what this thing can do so this here is our affordable gaming rig again with the 5600g in here using the stealth cooler and you can see that um well we've no graphics card it might look a bit weird at first but there are actually plenty of advantages going with a build like this that doesn't have a discrete card again apart from the things we just mentioned about availability and price gouging and things like that especially in 2021 you can also build extremely compact systems with this configuration but i've chosen this configuration here because i feel it's a little more indicative of what the average gaming pc builder would assemble you've got an mATX case mATX motherboard decent entry level power supply you don't really need anything fancy when building something like this and at the end of the day it's still going to again pack a punch in games which i want to talk about next so i want to kick things off first with CS-GO which i think is a pretty popular title especially for an APU of this caliber you can see we are hovering well over 100 fps pretty much the entire session here and i i apologize my gameplay is um it's it's pretty lackluster i sometimes you know i i get a little overconfident and then i start playing with bots in this game and i realize that i am just absolute trash but anyway i can't really fault the the frame rate here because we're well over well over 100 fps um and the in-game settings here i think are turned up to high in 1080p so that's pretty darn good if you're into competitive titles like CS-GO the 5600g is more than enough for your needs next we've dirt 5 and this is a modern off-road arcade style racing game i wanted to show you guys in 1080p what to expect with this APU you can see our gpu is pretty much pegged at 100 percent uh throughout this benchmark and that's just a result again of trying to keep in-game settings as high as possible and again the 1080p resolution here our cpu cores are just kind of uh they're kind of sitting on the back burner just hanging out there's still plenty of cp horsepower waiting to be leveraged and this game is more graphically intensive here uh which is why we are headed around 30 to 40 fps in this title of course i could have dropped this to 720p and would have been much more playable you'd have seen a lot higher frame rates but i'm not really trying to sell the high frame rate aspect of the apu in this case i'm just trying to show you that if you want your game to look pretty and you're okay with 30fps you can even play some super modern racing style games and get by and again we have to keep price and consideration here because it's easy to look at a title like this and think wow you know modern racing game only 30 fps that's no good but you've got to also remember that for the price of this ap you're getting six modern zen 3 cpu cores that's essentially a 5600 or 5600 g packed in at really no crazy amount of money so even if you were wanting to play a kind of a worst case scenario game like this 30 fps is still doable and if that's not good enough for you you can always drop the in-game resolution and get much higher frame rates but just for kicks this is the same game in 720p with ultra low in-game settings and you can see we're hitting that 60 fps target no problem and i'm kind of surprised that ultra low still looks actually decent here now the last game i wanted to test was the rift breaker and this one i'm actually playing in 720p right now which is why our little overlay is a bit bigger than usual you can see that we're holding above 60fps consistently so um this ap i would say is definitely a 720p gamer and if you're not really all that concerned about resolution and you're more worried about how pretty a game looks then dropping things down to 720p to kind of make up for that frame rate loss by bumping in game settings is definitely doable with the 5600g that's the other thing i wanted to show you so yes we are more or less gpu bound but at the same time this game is actually still rather pretty to look at even in 720p which i didn't really see myself saying when i began filming this but uh it's really not bad everything is very fluid we've got some extra in-game settings bumped in as well you've got the moving scenery in the background all the moving foliage looks really nice for a game like this now when it comes to other aspects of this APU including power draw i think you'll be pleasantly surprised power draw for this entire rig while running the dirt 5 benchmark which again is one of the heavier titles for this APU was under 80 watts almost throughout the entire thing that is extremely impressive given the kinds of graphical potentials we're seeing in this benchmark we're not running in 480p or something extremely unreasonable given the amount of money we're spending this is 1080p here and this title is only pulling at the most 75 or so watts from the wall again this is the entire system pulling power which means that the 65 watt TDP target for the 5600g is pretty much spot on from AMD and these power savings can be passed along to the power supply as well which will in turn lower the effective budget of a build like this you don't need a 6 700 or 800 watt power supply to power a 5600 g build assuming you also are not including a discrete graphics card if you're just running the APU itself even a 500 watt unit to be honest is a bit overkill seeing as though the entire build under a heavy load is only pulling around 80 watts and again as we were saying earlier because the thermal design power of this chip is around 65 watts which is relatively low we don't need to spend extra money on a beefier cpu cooler the one you get in the box the stealth cooler is actually pretty darn good and quiet under load so check this out i've run the dirt 5 benchmark in this machine for over 20 minutes i've got the lavalier mic in my hand and i'm going to put it right next to the stealth cooler here you can barely hear it that is insane if you just ask anybody with their eyes closed if this system was under load or not they'd tell you it was at idle it is an incredible cooler considering you don't have to pay any extra for it when you buy a 5600g and i suppose i should also know that while we are running this dirt 5 benchmark over and over cpu temperatures never reached 70 degrees celsius in fact our gpu temperatures were even lower than that now a few pointers especially for those looking to build a very similar system to this one here utilizing one of AMD's latest APUs like the 5600g you're going to want to put an emphasis on your memory kit few pointers i like to give my viewers first off stick to two sticks don't drop down to a single stick although it might be enticing from a price perspective to just buy a single dim of DDR4 going with two DIMMS will allow you to run dual channel which will greatly benefit your APU and as for frequency and timings i like to stick in the ballpark of around 3000 to 3600 megahertz and CL 16 CL 18 at the most CL 20 typically your timings will follow suit with your cast latency you'll also want to select a motherboard that includes a display connector you intend on using for your setup if you need an HDMI port but your motherboard doesn't have an HDMI port well that's going to be a problem right same goes for Displayport if you really want to use one of those you'd have to add a discrete card and that kind of defeats the purpose of buying an API in the first place and one more thing about motherboards and 5000 series APUs from AMD compatible BIOS as a result of AM4 being so versatile a lot of these bios tend to overlap in terms of cpu and ap compatibility a lot of older especially like b450 and even some earlier b550 boards will not have support for 5000 series APUs out of the box you'll want to check the retailer listing before purchasing if you don't have a cpu that you can't already throw in here that's already compatible by default to update the bios width remember you'll need a cpu in the socket in order to flash the bios but it needs to be a compatible cpu otherwise the other solution is to buy a board that has bios flashback or equivalent functionality that means you won't need a cpu and socket in order to update the bios to the most recent one for 5000 series APU support and maybe just one more pro tip while we're here save your box these things look cool so hopefully by this point we've shed a bit of light into the capabilities of the Ryzen 5 5600g from AMD and whether or not it's worth your hard earned i happen to think that it is if it wasn't worth it and i truly believe that i'd look like an idiot making this video these two SKUs from AMD are the most powerful desktop grade APUs on the planet it's not even a question you're going to get better graphical performance in this cpu and it's a bigger brother the 5700g than you will from anything that's ever been released by AMD or its competitors ever and you'd think with a title like that you'd be paying quite a bit more than what you actually will be from a retailer like Amazon or NewEgg this thing is extremely efficient i mean it literally sips on power it is so incredibly quiet yes even when paired with the stock in the box wray stealth cooler which is i'm still wrapping my head around the fact that AMD actually gives us decent coolers like we are not used to that from competitors one bit and to top things off this is actually a really freaking good cpu and APU i mean if you were buying this just for the cpu capabilities alone look no further than Ryzen 5 5600 5600x benchmarks that's basically what you're getting in this package with slightly altered frequencies but on top of that you're getting a pretty capable gpu as well you can get by and even modern titles with this thing which is something that i honestly didn't expect going into this and to top things off it's actually affordable it doesn't break the bank and look AMD is not saying that this is going to be the end-all be-all best gaming solution ever that's not what this is marketed as quite the contrary actually it is intended to be a budget solution for those who are very budget conscious looking to spend no more than about maybe four or five hundred bucks total in us dollars on a gaming pc overall this thing definitely fits the bill and it means you don't have to struggle to find a discreet graphics card at a decent price which is proving near impossible with all that said if you want to learn more about the Ryzen 5 5600g or even the Ryzen 7 5700g both from AMD be sure to check out relevant links in this video description as well as where to buy them although i'm sure you know where to find them these things are in stock at least as of time of filming they're in stock they're not suffering from the to the same extent that their discrete counterparts are and that's an awesome thing because not only are these relatively affordable but you can buy them right now there's nothing stopping you and even if you just want to buy one of these to kind of get you by until things subside which who knows when that'll happen but still it's not bad it's really not it's not a 4k APU okay that's not what AMD's marketing this as i think that would be a pretty awful experience i don't know why they would do that anyway but for 1080p and 720p gameplay this is good enough for a budget build point blank you don't even need to consider a discrete graphics card you don't need to look on Ebay haggle you don't need to cross your fingers and hope that something on amazon or new egg is going to be in stock soon you can just buy this because it's readily available and it's not being scooped up and masked by scalpers and miners and whoever else it's just a really good value and best of all it targets the budget conscious builder out there who's perhaps been hit the most by this current market that's all for this one be sure to let me know in the comment section below what you thought of this video and what you'd like to see next here on the channel if you enjoyed it give it a thumbs up if you aren't subscribed and get subscribed and i will catch you in the next one my name is greg thanks for learning with me.",

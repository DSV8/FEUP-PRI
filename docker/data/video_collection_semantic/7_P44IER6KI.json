    "transcript": "- Today we're unboxing the brand new OnePlus 6T and if you are new to my channel, welcome, and if you're not new, you guys are probably like, \"Justin, are you gonna make any other videos, \"besides videos about phones?\" Yes, I will, but bear with me, because it is new phone season, along with new video game season, which I'm super excited about. I am looking forward to the holidays, 'cause that's actually when I have free time to play games, but for now, we're going to unbox the brand new OnePlus 6T that was just announced. I'm so excited about the in-screen fingerprint sensor. Spoiler alert, if you didn't watch the presentation. This is the reviewer's kit that they sent out to people so let's see what's inside! OnePlus screen cleaning cloth. I will never turn down one of these things. I'm getting all the things that are things. Here it is, a collection of individuals possessed by a tremendous understanding and superior taste in the finest technology. If there's something that I do love about OnePlus is that they really do listen to their community and they love the people that use their phones which, I feel like most companies do, but they really do embrace the fans and I think that's incredible and I think that a lot of companies should take notice of that. We've got some accessories. I feel like most of you are here for the phone unboxing so, let's open this up and take a look. I am going to take this outside and take a few photos. I don't like to do unboxings but actually testing things out I guess I just do unboxings but just feel like I'm not giving you enough content like, show us the thing that you've just opened. Here's the box, it matches my nails. I didn't plan that actually, I swear, I didn't. Oh, look at this, a fingerprint sensor, in the screen. This is gonna be super exciting. I hope, hope, fingers crossed, that it works like it should. I feel like that's one of the biggest challenges that a lot of companies have been having is make the in-screen fingerprints actually work well. Look at this notch, or lack thereof. Can probably see it a little bit right there. I love that they already put a screen cover on here for you so you don't have to worry about damaging your screen. This is thin! I thought that it was gonna be a little bit thinner than the phone, but because it has the curved edges on the back it does give it sort of that feel that it is thinner. Already smudging it up, because I'm a hog. (lively music) Hi there! While this is setting up, let's unbox the rest of the things. So we get a nice, clear case. We've got a USB-C to a 3.5mm jack. I love the red detail. Another one of the incredible red USB-C cables and a charging brick. Oh, a word from the OnePlus CEO, I'll open it. Look, he called me friend, handwritten nonetheless. I think that he wrote those handwritten to every single person. Okay, next up, what have we got in here? We've got the Bullets, headphones. We're gonna slice open ever so gently. All the packaging looks great, I'm always super impressed. Here they are, you look great! Okay now, let's check out the cases that they have included. All their cases are usually super nice. This is the nylon bumper case, I like that. I wish this was maybe like a darker color though. This is the sandstone. This one is a much thinner case, so I think it really depends on like what you're kind of going for. This is the silicon red one, I love these ones because they have like the soft interior, much like this one as well. So this is everything that we've got. We've got three cases, actually we've got four cases, because the OnePlus actually comes with a case. Press and make your finger cover the fingerprint identification area as much as possible then lift after you feel a vibration. There's also a new screen calibration, I'm gonna just stay with the default. Ohh, it's done, it's ready, it's here. So, some of the new features in the 6T is it does have the screen unlock, it also has a bigger screen, this is a 6.1-inch AMOLED display. Pretty gorgeous and obviously the notch here. It's obviously much smaller than the iPhone and it's incredibly much smaller than the Pixel 3. There's also an option that you can hide it in the display settings and it's extremely easy to hide it so you don't have to have any special developer access, show, hide. In case you missed that the first time, show, hide. We're gonna keep it on because it really doesn't bother me that much. The base model of this phone starts at 128 gigs of storage with 6 gigs of RAM. I really love the in-screen fingerprint reader. I mean, it just, look, it just works. So, let's test it out. That's probably like the third time that I've done this so far and every time it does work, fantastic! So stay tuned, I hope that I won't have any issues, I know that there has been a lot of issues in previous displays, trying to make this all work, but so far, so good. You can also use that to quick-launch apps. I'm excited to test out the photos and the videos because you guys know that's probably one of my most favorite things to try out in new phones. OnePlus said that they have a new algorithm that automatically adjusts photos taken on the front and the rear camera. So, if you're taking pictures of people or food or text, it will automatically figure out what you're taking your picture of and try to make it look as best as possible. I've been so interested in all of the AI photography because these phones and cameras are learning the things that we're taking photos of and automatically adjusting to what they think looks best. At some point, I don't even know what looks good anymore because I'm so overwhelmed by technology and trying to put photos and videos side by side and figuring out which one looks best when, sometimes, you just have to step back, unless I fall over, and appreciate something for what it is. I think that's been something that I've been working on a lot lately, is I've been so overwhelmed with technology, and it's something that I love, and I've basically had a passion for my entire life, but it's trying to find that balance between, okay, this is something that I love but now I'm feeling super overwhelmed by it. How do I find that fine line and that balance between tech and no tech? If you guys have any suggestions, please leave them in the comments below. Speaking of tech, let's go back to this phone, because I wanna go outside now and take some photos but before I do that, I'm just gonna kind of go through it really quickly and I'll just take my first selfie because, why not? We're here. People look so dumb taking selfies, I know it, I know I look stupid, but I'm gonna do it anyway. And there it is, that's my first picture. - [Man] We wanted to create a phone that got better and better and better with every update and the only way to do that was to ask-- - OnePlus put a nice little short film on here for us to watch. For video, this shoots 4K, 60, and it also does super slo-mo. It'll do 240 and 480 at 1080p. Now that I've unboxed this, I've unboxed all of the accessories. I don't think I have anything else more that I can say to you here at this desk. Let's go outside and test out some of the photos. Look at the little animation that it has when you touch the fingerprint. Okay, what case am I gonna put on it? Because, if I've learned one thing, iJustine cannot be trusted without a case on her phone. We're out on a hike and this is the first time that I'm trying the front-facing video on the OnePlus 6T. So, what do you guys think? We're only 12 minutes in. Mh, we've got a way to go. - What do you think, second breakfast after this? - This will be third breakfast, 'cause I had one breakfast and then I had breakfast again - So we're getting third-- - And multiple coffees. - So we're getting third breakfast after this? - I think so! - Yes! (lively music) - [iJustine] Are we having fun? (lively music) Okay, we've just hit a mile. Look at this focus, that's pretty good. There's our friends up there. So this is the back-facing camera, 4K. 1x, 2x zoom. Yeah, get that drink, Jen! 5, 6, 8x, they look good. (lively music) - Are you filming? - [Woman] Yeah, man. - Okay, so, this it the front-facing camera. - [Woman] No, it's not. - It's not, it's the back-facing camera. 4K, how does it look? - [Woman] Good! - Well, I'm asking them, how does it look? Now, let's see what happens if you walk, walk with me. - [Woman] You're gonna walk into a bush. - (laughs) Almost did! This is really riveting content. Hello! - On the front-facing not front-facing camera. - Not front-facing, rear-facing. I mess it up every single time. Like, obviously, it doesn't really matter. Yeah, I'm really, actually really liking this phone a lot so far, I love the feel of it, like it's just, it's nice! So we're having a, oh, I guess it's sort of a Halloween party, and I have to finish my OnePlus 6T video because it's, the embargo is up right now, as you guys are watching this. You guys excited about the (laughs) - [Woman] Now it's a party! - Now the party starts! Okay, 4K 60 is first. So I did film this earlier and I don't really have anything that exciting to film and it's dark out, so we're gonna put some water into the glass - [Woman] No way! - Yes. - [Woman] Has anyone ever done that before? - I don't know. - [Woman] Get out of town, we can't put, we can't be the first on YouTube to do this. - (laughs) Here we go, okay, we gotta get it here. - [Woman] Where? - Oh, sh! (screams) Oh no! What is happening? Is that Sprite? - No. (laughing) - Okay, (mumbles) the water, it's water. I hate everything about what's happening. (lively music) - [Man] There she is! (laughs) (laughing) - Okay, I'm wet. (laughing) - [Woman] I wasn't recording. - You probably were, 'cause you know how to use an Android phone. (laughs) - [Man] Did you miss the whole thing? - That brings my OnePlus 6T video to a close. We're done unboxing and a little test of the camera. We're playing Mario Party now. Cue Mario Party. (laughs) Naughty man. See how this is crazy, look at the notch. I guess it looks like a little teardrop. - [Man] No way. - Drop top. - Oh, little! - Raindrop. (laughs) - Little! - Hi Maddie. - [Woman] Wanna see the notch? Man, look at the notch. It's like, I want this blanket to be right up your leg. - [iJustine] There you go, buddy. - [Woman] There you go, sweetheart. Spoiled. - Here you go. Okay, happy OnePlus 6T launch day. See you guys later. (rhythmic music)",

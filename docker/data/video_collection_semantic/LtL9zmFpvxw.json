    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and today, oh my goodness, we're playing Animal Crossing. A lot of you guys said you wanted me to play some gameplay of this. And a lot of you asked what have I been doing in lockdown, in quarantine and this is what I've been doing. I've been playing this game a lot. Although my island doesn't really look like I've been playing it a lot. Like I feel like it should be a little bit better than it is, but I've definitely a wall-mounted tool board, okay that's kinda boring but whatever, I'll take it. I will take every single thing that I can get, but I've been playing this game a lot. I'll show you my house. This is just gonna be a little island tour, show you guys around, give you a little looksy of what I've been doing. It's like, I don't even know, it's actually pretty terrible. I just have a lot of stuff. Before it was even worse. I had so much stuff everywhere that I couldn't actually walk. I mean I have a mixer on the floor, Jenna gave me this really cool radio today. I don't have any songs, no! I need to download some songs from K.K. Slider. I should probably go to my Nook Shop. So I've got like a little fish tank over here this little puffer fish. I've also got a hamster, it's just hanging out. I don't think I have to feed him, but he's been running on this wheel for like four or five days solid. Incense and candles, it's my zen zone. This is my little area where I sit here. I sometimes like to leave my island open so people can come and visit. So I sit here and they know that I'm busy. I'm not sure how they know that I'm busy, they just kinda I guess probably realize it 'cause I'm not doing anything but sitting here. I just started a little garden of some seeds and stuff that I collect from other people's islands. They're not going well cause there's not much there. I also have a little swap meet, which I got inspired by Ed. He has a little swap meet at his where you can leave something and then take something. This is the beginnings of it. I also have to make a custom sign, but I haven't really figured out how to do that yet. I mean I figured it out but I haven't figured out how to make it not look like crap. So I'm gonna do that later. I also have to replant all of these trees because I planted them too close to the edge and they haven't been growing. So that's on the to-do list for today. I've just been doing some fishing. Today I recorded this already, and I realized that the audio wasn't recording cause I haven't done this in so long, and I had never gone into the museum. I've been playing this for weeks and I, actually let me see how long I've been playing it, for eight days. Eight days since lockdown, eight days since my birthday and I've been playing this a lot. But I'd never gone into the museum. I would just go in give Blathers my nonsense and then say, \"See you later, I'm outta here.\" The museum is really crazy. The fact that they built this in one day. I don't think I have any fossils, I don't think I have anything that you're gonna want me to donate. Yeah I didn't think so. This was my favorite part about it. Over here is like the bugs and insects, it's so beautiful. Like what is this? How did you make this in a day Blathers? Look at this big old tree, like this is incredible. You built this in a day, you're a liar. I don't understand. I remember playing this game before and not wanting to give anything to the museum cause I'm like this is my stuff. Back up, don't touch. Cool great chat Blather's. We're gonna go and see the rest of my island. I showed you my house, I showed you sort of the layout, so this is what my map looks like. Oh five, we've got five islanders now. This is my little beach area, this is a money tree that is growing, I can't wait for that. I'm gonna get this snail, I still haven't got a tarantula yet. Okay, oh what did I want to do? I wanted to do something over here Now I don't remember. This is the problem with this game. It's cause I get so sidetracked. Get in there, go in. Oh this is what I wanted. I wanted a K.K. Slider song. Oh it's gonna be in the mail so I'm not gonna have it now. Got to get used to not having things immediately, like groceries. It's so weird because in Los Angeles grocery delivery is something that I've been doing for probably like eight years. And the fact now it's you can't even do it because everybody is doing it. So this is what I've been spending most of my time on. Come here your little hopper. Gosh this is absurd, got you. A rice grasshopper, I don't think I've caught one of those before. No my nets. It's flimsy because I'm cause I've been lazy. Up here I love the layout of these houses a lot. I kinda wanted to have everybody close together so that I could just go chat with them, like quickly. This guy was sick the other day, I went into his house, he coughed and sneezed all over me. Oh my gosh one of my villagers has Corona. I'm terrified. He needs tissues. Oh gosh, yeah you do need some medicine but there's not cure yet buddy. You disgusting hog, haven't you, no it's not you. You're new, you just moved in. It was Jacob. Social distancing, don't you understand the spread of Corona? I think this is his house. If he's in here I'm gonna yell at him. Nope not Jacob's house. Hi how are you? What's the latest? I like that pink vaccuum though, maybe she'll gift me one. A real kind gesture. These houses were so annoying to make cause you had to piece together all of the different pieces. You had to find the furniture. You had to get all of the stuff together. I mean it really wasn't that big of a deal, I mean what else do I have to do? Nothing, there's my garden and my little lawn gnome there. Really have to replant those trees cause I'm just like thinking about all this time that I'm wasting and they're not growing anything. Come here fishy. If you're having lots of friends visit, I'll sometimes just leave this on and then I'm surprised with visitors all day long. It's super exciting. Oh, Ed's online. Have to do a visiting my friends episode here if you guys are enjoying this. What's it gonna be, what's it gonna be? Oh this is new, I don't have I don't think I've ever caught one of those. Does anybody remember when I made my island on the southern hemisphere? It's actually a good thing that I did because all of my friends on the northern hemisphere, like we all have different types of things and then our seasons will be different. So we'll all be able to have different things. This is him, this is the Corona cough-er. I was wearing that same outfit that he was wearing yesterday. But I'm gonna pick those flowers. Somebody must have planted those because I don't have those here. I mean beautiful. So a lot of people that have ever played this game, they follow me on twitter, it's hard to really explain it to somebody if you've never played it. I'm sure some of you guys haven't played this so you're like, \"What the heck is even happening right now?\" Yeah, I didn't think that you had that. He talks so much. Oh please do not tell me. When I accidentally click, Please Tell Me. I get so mad. Hitting that fast forward button as fast as I can. Let's see what Mabel has? Yeah, I didn't buy these shoes though. Those are really nice. Uh, don't like it. I'm sticking with this. Timmy and Tommy, I've been enjoying the Reddit threads of people jailing them to use for ransom. If you guys have any other Animal Crossing tips I would love to hear them, because I feel like there's so much stuff even though this seems like such a simple game, it's really not. I mean if you've played it you guys know, but if you haven't played it you're like, \"Well you're just doing stuff.\" I'm doing stuff, but there's a lot to what I'm doing. Thank you for watching. If you enjoyed this game play and want to see more, leave me a comment and maybe I'll do it again. I'm really excited though, I've set up this setup today. I just posted a video talking about my perfect gaming setup and then guess what? I ripped it all down and I started over. Classic, classic Justine. I'll see you guys in my next video. Bye.

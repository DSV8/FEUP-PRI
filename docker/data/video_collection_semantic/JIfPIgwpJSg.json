    "transcript": "- [All] Dad, are we there yet? - That is something I've heard far too many times now. Most parents would just chuck a couple of iPads into the back of the car and call it a day. But I guess I shouldn't be surprised that growing up with Mr. Tech Tips himself as a dad has given my kids a slightly different perspective on what a good gaming experience is. So it's pretty safe to say that cut the rope ain't gonna cut it. But when EcoFlow reached out, oh, about sponsoring a video to show off their power kits, which can add full 120 volt power and a massive battery bank to your vehicle, I finally had the opportunity to make a video that I have wanted to make for about five years. Kitting out my van with the ultimate gaming setup. Except in order to achieve a suitable level of wife approval factor, it's gonna take a little more work than just duct taping monitors to the backs of the seats and seat belting in a test bench. We're gonna do this thing right. Or well Jake's involved, so at least right enough. (mellow synth music) (air whooshing softly) (cube taps softly) (cube thrills softly) (upbeat synth music) - Woo, look at all these goodies. - Truthfully, I'm coming in kind of cold here, so I'll be learning what's going on along with you guys. What EcoFlow ended up, oh my god, look at this thing. - Do you want me to move the box? - Sending over is there four kilowatt hour power kit. Specifically the independence kit version, which you can think of as having all the fixings for more permanent setups. So the batteries and the hub are part of the base get set kit, while the prepared kit adds a distribution panel. - [Jake] This down here? - Whoa. - Oh wow. This is part of the prepared kit, which adds this fused distribution panel. (Linus laughs softly) - It's got breakers? - [Linus] Is this for like motor homes? - Yes. - This is not for, oh really, yes. So this is not for minivans. - You could put it in a shed too. - That won't stop us. Then they sent the independence kit, which adds a console on top of that. So you got this touch screen at the front where you can control your power thing. Your kids are being too loud. Boom, no power! How's your games now, (beeps)? - [Harrison] But they'd still have the batteries. - Oh yeah, they'd still have the batteries. - No, no, he's shutting off the output. - Yeah, no, I can shut it off. - Ahhh, yes you can. - I can shut it off. And look at these batteries. What the hell, are these lithium or lead acid? - [Jake] Lithium iron phosphate. - Shut up. - Wow. - This has gotta be so much freaking power. - Two kilowatt hours. - And there's solar panels. - [Harrison] And solar panel cables. - Oh, and cables. None of this stuff is unique to EcoFlow. Normally you would buy all of these parts separately from different manufacturers and kind of piece the system together yourself. But what we like about this is that, that it should be basically plug and play, giving us a ton of capabilities. So, one, it gives us a bunch of AC power for even high performance gaming PCs in the back. Two, it allows us to run all of that stuff without the engine running. And three, it allows us to charge up our batteries off the grid so we can game while we're on a freaking camping trip. - It's pretty sick. Did I mention this is almost the same amount of battery backup we have in our UPS. - Like for the server room? - Yeah. - This is a lot of battery. - Yeah. - You wanna put it in our van? - Get started? - Yeah, yeah. - I really do. Wait, you wanna take this apart? It's super simple, I already know what I'm doing. - Why do you wanna take it apart? - To show what's inside, it's neat. - What about our warranty? Yeah. - Ha! - That's one of the great- - This is pre-production. It's going back to them anyway, doesn't matter. - Well, that's not very fun to disassemble. - No, it's 'cause you're not done yet. There's screws. There's one over there and then I put two in over here, and the rest are on the table, 'cause I wanted to be fast. - Hey, did you know that we have a screwdriver? - What? - LTTstore.com. - Boom, goes that dynamite. - [Jake] Oh my God. I don't think we should be touching this. - [Harrison] Don't touch it. - Oh my God. - Look at this heat sink. - That is terrifying. - No wonder this thing has four cooling fans at the back of it. - Look at the like the size of those contacts. - God. - Wow, that's a lot of power. There's lots of Silastic, which is good. So the vibrations of a vehicle aren't gonna cause any of the solder joints to break, which is pretty important for something like this that's meant to go in a car. I'm just already seeing how amazing this is gonna be compared to trying to piece something out yourself. I have no idea how much effort that would take, but I imagine it's a lot. - It is. - Three of us screwdrivering at the same time. - I don't have a screwdriver. - I think the word you're looking for is screwing. - I'm just gonna start plugging things in all right. - Two. - On the side. - Whoa. - What? - Not, what? - Why not? - Because we're gonna do it in the car. - Well, why not do it outside of the car? - Jake, are you plugging things in while we haven't even finished putting it back together yet? - Yeah, whatever. What's the worst that could happen? You get shocked. - Actually lots of things. Are you powering it on right now? - It's not working, so I tried. I'll unplug it just for safety. - Okay. - That has a really gnarly connector. - Yeah, they're not supposed to come out. - That's what you get, Jake. - Oh, there we go. - But while it's not really designed to be constantly plugged and unplugged, it was a requirement for the project for me that it could be removed if it needed to be. That, ooh, is where this guy comes in. Basically it's a piece of plywood with some carpet over top of it that has the included mounts for the batteries as well as the hub all bolted to it so that they're not flying around in the cabin. But in the event that we wanna remove the whole power setup, 'cause you know, my kids lost their gaming privileges or something like that. It's a matter of taking two strapping young men. - Look, I'm already holding the battery, okay. - Okay, fine. Two strapping young men, you'll have to imagine the other one, and lifting the whole thing out of the car. It's a little bit easier to assemble the whole setup first and then lower it into the van though. So Jake, do you wanna maybe put that battery down at some point? - [Jake] Yeah, it's not heavy, don't worry. - The hub is a huge part of what makes the power kit so easy to configure. This one piece replaces what would probably be five pieces in a DIY kit. Two solar charge controllers, a DC to DC battery charger, a DC to DC converter, and then a sine wave inverter charger. All right there. Do you have those screws to screw it to the screw thing? Buddy. Okay, no, no, but I meant buddy this, I didn't mean you. - Oh. - Sorry, no, I was, that would be a very rude way for me to ask for screws. - [Jake] Hey buddy, would you get it together? - Hey, hey buddy. - Wait, hold on, we should probably strap- - Hey, hey buddy. - That's kind of a rude way to address me. - Yeah, buddy? - Are you guys not buddies? - That's the Canadian way to address people. - Not when he says it like that. - Buddy. - Hey buddy. - Hey buddy. - Hey buddy. Hey there, friend. - [Jake] We should strap these batteries on first. - I feel like you're probably feeling the right feels. - [Harrison] These are for the- - [Linus] AC out and DC out. - That go to the distribution panel. - Yeah, so we're gonna wait, but we're not using the distribution panel for our configuration. - But I still wanted to leave them just in case. - Right. - And we also want the extra room for the console wire. - The distribution panel is great if you want to have individually breakered zones coming off of your power hub. We don't really need that because everything that we're running can be handled by a single 20 amp outlet, which is right here. - It's cool that it's 20 amp, eh? - Yeah, that's really nice. - It's a lot of juice. - These straps are nice, eh. - Very nice. - Look at this. - [Linus] I'm gonna take off this thing. - [Harrison] Yes. - React to my straps, dammit. Look at that. - I told you, you're a strapping young man. - Great, that's what I've always wanted to hear. - Do we have a rough runtime estimate for this with like a couple of gaming PCs on it? - I can do the math for you right now. Four kilowatt hours is 4,000 watts for an hour or a thousand watts for four hours. So let's say. - Oh wow. Probably like six plus hours then. - Well, I mean, how much power are you gonna draw? A gaming computer, you don't need something crazy, right? - Yeah, no, we're not gonna go RTX 4090 on these things. - Yeah, so hours is the answer. Plus if you're driving- - Wow. - We can charge off the alternator of the car. - Right. - And solar panels on the roof- - Right. - Which we haven't even gotten to yet. - Oh, we'll get to that. Are we supposed to hold it from these straps? - [Harrison] From the batteries. - From the, oh, that makes sense. - From the handles. - Oh yeah, wow. - [Harrison] Yeah, super simple. - What the, this is so nice. - Yeah, it's actually kind of manageable. (exclaims) I mean, kind of. - Okay. - Okay. (unit thuds softly) Oh yeah. - [Jake] Oh, fits like a glove. - [Linus] Oh yeah. - Here, look at this. - [Linus] Jake, what are you doing? What are you doing? - I wanna see it turn on. Hello. - What's wrong with you? What's your problem? - Maybe it's dead. Oh, there, 58% look at that. - You can fit so much percent in this bad boy. Okay, are these directional? - Nope. - No. - Nope, all right, cool so- - [Jake] I would probably plug the thing that says bat two into the thing where the label would be useful. - [Harrison] I'm glad I labeled everything. - What was the point of labeling everything when we were just going to- - Yeah, not listen. - Willy-nilly plug things in. - See, look, I plugged it in the right way. - [Linus] I mean we've got the batteries on the wrong sides though. - [Jake] What do you mean? that one bat, oh - That one going over to this side. - We're just like, whoa, look. - [Linus] Hey, it's fired up. - [Harrison] Yes, it does that. - [Jake] Do we plug the screen in now? - [Harrison] Yeah. Where does this plug in? - That goes all the way in the front seat. - Well, it will, but I mean we don't need it right now. - Or you can use a smartphone app. - There's a smartphone app. - Oh. - No, I like that thing. - [Harrison] Yeah, I thought you might. - Yeah, that thing is sick. - But the kids, they could learn, they could cut the wire. - [Linus] No, they won't figure that out. (Jake laughs loudly) - [David] And do you know the trouble they'd be in? - Yeah, exactly. (Jake laughs loudly) Besides it's just a Cat 5E cable. So like I could easily replace it. - That's true. And if they do that, you still have the smartphone app. - Yeah, got 'em. - It literally is just an ethernet cable, nice. - Oh, what are we looking at? - It's doing things. - Oh, it just kicked on. - EcoFlow, oh. Do you feel like the eco is flowing through you? - I do. - Holy crap. - 99 days of battery. Okay, we have no load on it right now. It's just the power LEDs on the unit itself. - But 99 days, wow. - Wow. - Wait this is- - We can look at that LED for so many days. - [Jake] Wow, look at that. So it shows you the individual battery percentages, their current discharge rate, which is very low obviously. - [Linus] Yeah. - [Jake] Battery heating, charge level. Oh, sick, you can set the max charge level. - That would be to extend the overall lifespan of your battery at the cost of some of the individual charge capacity. You'll typically see that on anything from cell phones, to battery banks, to electric vehicles. - It's kind of like over prersiv, it's kind of like over pro. (beeps) It's kind of like over profision (beeps) Why can't I say the word? - It's kinda like over provisioning on an SSD. - There you go. You can also set a minimum at like 30% so the batteries won't go below that level. - Yeah. - Which is also super handy. - Being too charged and too not charged is bad for them. - And you can also just use it as like a safety. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Okay, so it's definitely gonna wanna- - You just tuck it right there. - Oh. - We didn't need that for any further shots, I'm sure. - Look, I'm trying to cable manage here, okay. Geez. I don't know, I was kind of thinking like here or something. Or like, oh, it looks kind of janky, doesn't it? Yeah, it's pretty big actually. Can you do it the other way? No, not really. I'm kind of leaning towards the app all of a sudden. (Jake laugh softly) Having a little change of heart here. Yeah, hmm. Hmm. Oh yeah. Oh yeah, right there, bud. - [Jake] Heads up display, baby. - Right, I guess this is the point where we talk about how to actually charge the batteries. - It's plugged into the car. - Okay, Jake already mentioned that you can charge it off your alternator, but obviously that's not the kind of thing where there's just a plug in the, you know, under the hood of your car that you plug this thing into. - Yeah, it's a little more complicated. - What did you guys do? Because whatever they did, my light's flicker now. - We are going to be installing the alternator kit for the EcoFlow. And you can see it's just two lines positive, negative. We just gotta hook them up to the alternator. We can run this wire all the way through the firewall. There's already a gasket there that we'll just have to make a little cut. We're gonna run it under the carpet and molding, all the way to the back. We'll make sure this, we have enough slack so we can actually hook this into the EcoFlow module where we're gonna mount it in the back. We're not sure exactly how that's gonna happen, but it'll be nice, secure. And then whatever line wants to do with it, he gets to do with it. - Tell me what looks different about your engine bay. - This. - Is it the fact that it says LTT right there, that's throwing you off? - [Linus] That is a bit of a hint, yup. - Now in order to charge a get up like this, you wouldn't really wanna plug into a cigarette lighter. That would only give you like 150 watts of power. That's not enough. Instead we're hooking up directly to the alternator- - Right. - The part that charges the battery in your car. By default, alternators in most cars are gonna have a little bit of headroom. So on the hub we can actually configure how much power it'll draw. But I think in part two we're gonna put a beefier alternator in here so we can like charge at 100 amps or something crazy like that. - [Harrison] A super beefy alternator. The stock one, will do 130 at peak load. The one that we're getting, will do 125 at idle, 250 max. - 250. - [Harrison] It's huge. - But it's really simple. It's literally just two wires. You have a positive that you slap on to the alternator positive, and a negative that you just gotta put to a ground point, which we've done kinda right here. - Wait, did my van have a roof rack before? - [Jake] It didn't. We're gonna use those to mount the solar panels, which are over there. - Wait, the solar panels are like just going on like permanently? - Yeah. - I just assumed that would be more of like a camping thing. Like you pull up and then you just kind of sit them out behind the van. - I mean you could do that, but wouldn't you rather just have them on all the time? - So this thing will charge while we're driving down the highway. - Well, it'll charge driving down the highway from the alternator. It'll charge when you're at your camping spot not doing anything from the solar panels. - Will it take solar and alternator power at the same time? - Absolutely. - AC power. So if you were at a campsite that had an AC power plug, you could go AC power, alternator power and solar panel all at the same time. - Burn all the fuel. - The only limitation is that it'll only do 100 amps at one time. - Oh no, only a hundred amps at a time. God heavens, whatever will I do? - Why don't we try the alternator thing? - Oh, you wanna charge it with the car? - Yeah, let's see what happens. - I thought you have to be like at speed for the alternator to really like charge stuff. - Okay, so the cool thing about the EcoFlow thing is you can tell it whether or not to charge that idle. - Oh. - So you can say no, don't charge it idle. And when your car's just sitting there and it's not even on, it's not gonna pull power from your battery. - Oh, okay, that's cool. - But we can just turn that off and just watch it pull some power from your battery. Or you can just start the car. - Yeah, I don't wanna pull power from the battery. - Just start the car. Start the car. - Mm, you're kind of in an enclosed space-ish. - Man, just like- - Its a big enclosed space. - [Linus] All right, all right, all right. - Here look, let me solve that problem. Airflow. - All right, all right, all right. Okay, you ready? - Start her up. (car beeps softly) So head back here, go to input and we'll turn alternator on. - [Linus] Wow, 17 whole watts. - And we'll say alternator input current. - [Linus] Oh my god. - We'll give her, let's give her 30 amps. - Oh wow. - There you go. You're getting 200 watts charged. Now give it a little rev. - That's definitely gonna cost me some fuel. (engine revs softly) Okay. Working as intended. - [Jake] It's less fuel than you'd think, honestly. - Really? - Yeah. Alternators are gonna cause drag on your engine regardless, even if you're not using an EcoFlow, to charge your battery and all these other things. So you're just adding a bit more to that. - Uh-huh, 430 watts of more. - Yeah. Also if you leave it on and shut the car off, it'll actually detect that the voltage has dropped, 'cause when your alternator's running and the engine's running, it's gonna be at like 14 1/2 volts and when it's off probably around 12 1/2. It can detect that and not draw power too. - Yeah, 'cause if it draws power from your like lead acid battery that's used to start the car, you're gonna have such a bad time. Whole family camping trip ruined. - Yeah. - But hold on. You could plug a battery charger into your EcoFlow and charge the battery back. - [David] Take some power. - [Harrison] And while you're waiting for CAA, you got video games to play. - Yeah. - Yeah, okay. - What the, okay. - [Jake] That's why we need professionals. - Yeah, these are not the same width as the roof rack. You're probably wondering how on Earth this cable from the solar panels is gonna make its way into the trunk. We actually have a plan for that. Check this out. There's a little tiny gap in the track for the roof rail. So we're gonna put this under the plastic here. Then it'll come across here. And all we gotta do is put a little hole in this grommet and boom, we're inside. Again, we're gonna do that once the solar panels actually go on the roof with the professional installation, so they don't go flying off like the hood of a Tesla. (horn blares loudly) (people exclaim loudly) - [Jake] Got 'em. - Unfortunately, this is a pre-production unit, so our solar charging isn't gonna work yet. But in part two we're gonna have a production unit. So we'll be able to show you all three methods of charging it. I think, Jake, yes. You were planning to show the third method now though, which does work, which is AC power. - Mm-hmm. - So if you're at a campsite or something that has power or you just in your garage or you're just- - In your garage. - Or yeah, charge it in your garage or something like that, This is gonna be the most economical way to charge it. Well, economical and fast. Obviously, solar is economical. - And the cool thing about this, this cable comes bare. So you can terminate this thing with a 30 amp cable and charge at one 20 volt 30 amp. - Oh really, wow. - This is just, you know, 15 amp. So we're gonna set in the little panel 15 amp max. But you could do 30. - That's pretty good. - 3000 watts. - Yeah. - That's a lot. It would charge really fast. It's zero volts. Wait it says, oh this plug might be dead. Hold on. - Oh, is that actually plugged into anything? - It is, but a bunch of the plugs in this building are (beeps) so. Is it working now? - [Linus] Nope. It's a really good building we bought, eh? - Now? - Nope. It says it's getting 14 watts from the alternator, which can't be right. - Oh, it's much better. - Hey. - All right, leave it, leave it, yeah. - There we go. - [Harrison] We're good. - 119.5 volts, 0.6 amps, it's working on it. It's taking a sec, 71 watts. 150 watts, let's go. - [Harrison] Ooh, yup. - [Jake] What's the amperage set to, 15? - There we go. Set to 15 amps, yeah. So is it just gonna suck back that entire circuit? - [Jake] Pretty much. - You don't wanna set that to 15 amps. You wanna set that to 80% of whatever your breaker is. - [Jake] It usually doesn't really go much higher than like 1.3, which is kind of where you want to be. - Is that just what the voltage dropped to from this load in this building? Because that would be awful. I wouldn't be surprised. - Look at how fast this charge is, hour and a half to do 50% more. - Holy (beeps). - [Jake] So it'll take three hours to charge on this or with a 30 amp plug, it'll take an hour and a half. So wait, if you start the car. - Oh, will it go even faster? - Yeah. - 1.54 kilowatts. That's the charging time to beat. Let's go. - [Jake] Give her a little gas. - All right. (engine revs softly) - [Jake] Woo. Let's go. Two kilowatts. - Okay, which is all pretty cool. But does it actually run? Let's give it a shot. Unrelated to this video, but we're over here in lab two right now and you can see all the rackings in for all the like pallets upon pallets of products we're gonna be testing in the coming months and years. Pretty exciting. Is this really what we're using for gaming, this classic BenQ? I liberated it from NCIX a long time ago. - [Jake] Oh no. All right, it kicked on. - We are definitely gonna need a more elegant solution for this. Do we have a plan for this? - [Jake] Yeah, just different monitors. - Oh, okay. And they'll just mount to the back of the headrest? - Yeah, you can buy those little ones with the little hookies. - Ah. - We used to play on a Wii in our back seat when we would go on road trips. - Would the acceleration of the car mess with the accelerometer and the Wiimote? - I don't know. And I feel like we didn't really play games that needed the motion aspect 'cause you need the light bar thing for that. - Oh, poor Wii. We didn't play those games. Got 'em. Obviously, we're gonna go with something much more modest in terms of spec, and ideally something that will fit under the seats, both with airflow in and exhaust out that don't somehow interfere with each other. There's definitely a lot of problems to solve, but for now, ah. (gasps) Mind you, would anything prevent us from running like a Plex media server? - No. - No. - Locally? - That would be freaking sick. - You might as well just have, you should have a shield for that. - Yeah. - 'Cause that'd be the lowest power. - Yeah. - We're at 145 watts right now. 250 watts, what are you doing? - I turned on this ancient CFL backlit monitor, Jake, that you guys gave me. Hey, do we have peripherals at all? Can you believe Rocket disabled the SOVA? This thing is amazing. - Disabled? - [David and Harrison] Discontinued. - Sorry, did I say disabled? Can you believe Rocket disabled? Can you believe Rocket discontinued the SOVA? This thing is so cool. As soon as I found out it was EOL, I bought like three of them. (Jake laughs softly) - Yeah. - Well, there's nothing else quite like it. The wall. - You should game and I'll back it out into the parking lot. - I'm down. - [Jake] We should remove the solar panels from the roof before you move the vehicle. - Good call. - No way. - [David] You wanna do that right now? - Okay. - No way. - Falling off. - Be a man. - [Jake] It's okay, it's only your paint that we'd scratch. - Yeah, oh, we should remove them. (David laughs loudly) Are we going for a gaming drive? - Oh my God, what are you, four foot nothing? Like, Jesus. - Look, just chill, okay. Okay. - Is that a problem? - (laughing) I mean, no. - [Jake] No? - Okay, just, okay, oh. - [Jake] That's probably okay. - Jake. - What, you said it's not a problem? We've got more power than we're using. But it says it's gonna take a couple days to charge 'cause it's only by 100 watts or so. The car is very mad the door is open. - [Linus] Yeah, that makes sense. - [Harrison] And we never saw them again. - [Linus] Oh my god, car, it's fine. - [Jake] It's fine, we're just gaming, all right. - We're gamers. - [Jake] We're gamers. - Hold on, hold on, I'm not gaming yet, Jake. - I'm sorry, I'll stop my bad. Uber for gamers. (Linus laughs softly) (Linus gasps softly) - That would be so cool as a third episode. We gotta take this thing out as an Uber. - Does anyone have their Uber license? - I know someone, the Uber driver who offered to lend us his Uber for a mock e-review. - [Jake] Hmm. - [Linus] I have his number. - [Jake] Cool. - Motion blur, ew. Man, this might be a little nauseating. - [Jake] (laughing) What do you mean? - I have concerns, okay, I have concerns. - Look, I set the alternator charging to 40 amps. So we're making more juice than we're losing. - This is freaking hilarious, Jake. - Wow, 600 watts. What are you gaming? The power- - I'm playing \"Cyberpunk,\" obviously. - Oh, 'cause yeah. The power draw just went way up. - Whoa, you can't hear the hub in the back. You hear those fans going? - Yeah, oh yeah. - Oh, it's not, no they're not doing it anymore. I guess that was just part of like a response to a sudden heavy load or something? - [Jake] It's also pre-production. - Right. - So it could be that the fan curve gets better later. I can't believe this is what's happening right now. I can't shoulder check, that's for sure. - [David] We're going on the road? Oh. - This is beyond stupid. - What's our power draw? All right, I mean, we're inputting 600 watts and you're using about 600 watts. So we're pretty much even right now. - This monitor is an absolute pig. Like yes, this computer's pretty powerful. What is this RTX 4080? - 3080 Ti. - Oh, 3080 Ti. But a lot of this power consumption is the monitor. - Well, also there's an Epic in there. So it's probably just drawing 280 watts like all the time. - Time to murder some civies. Crime reported. - [Jake] You're gonna get some bumpy bumps here. Brace for impact. - [Harrison] Bet that car doesn't have a PC in it. (Jake and Linus laugh loudly) - [Jake] Yeah, what, you're not gaming while you're driving? What are you? - What are you, a loser? - Nerd? Yeah, are you a loser? You gotta get stuffed in a locker, nerd. (Jake and Linus laugh softly) - [Harrison] The PC is my own space heater. - Yeah. - David, is your ass hot? - Are we concerned about cooling? - [Jake] Well, you got AC. It's a car, you're fine. - Well, yeah, but that could be a lot of heat load on it. - [Jake] I mean how many watts is a human? The heat load of a human is like 100. - 100. Yeah, that's like nothing compared to what we're looking at. - Five extra people. - Yeah, each of those solar panels is rated for about 100 watts. And if my experience is anything to go by, that means you're probably gonna get like 60 watts out of them. But even so, that'll take a little bit of the bite out of your power consumption for sure. - Especially when we put the bigger alternator in and we have another 1100 amps, we could charge at 1000 watts while you're driving. And look, I shut off the car and it automatically detected the voltage is lower and it's only pulling 10 watts. - How long does it say I can game back here? - [Jake] Three hours. - Three hours. - [Jake] But you're pulling 600 watts. - Not bad and we're only charged halfway. - Yeah. - So you could have two of these rigs running for three freaking hours. - And those are not power optimized at all. - Not even a little. - 600 watts is a lot for one gaming experience. - This is amazing. I forgot how much heat this monitor throws from the front of it. Look, I'm freaking warm sitting here right now. I gotta get outta here. You'll never catch me, copper. Oh. - [Jake] Well, you died so they caught you. - Yeah, well, they didn't catch me. The bullet caught me. Just like you caught the end of this video. If you enjoyed it, you might also enjoy the one where Jake and I mess around with the heating system at my house. - Hmm, I love heating. - It's actually working great. - Sick. And get subscribed cause there's gonna be a part two where this actually gets fully decked out. Monitors, more computers, better alternator, more power. Goodbye.",

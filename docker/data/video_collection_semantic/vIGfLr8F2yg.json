    "transcript": "Well, the Tech News is coming in and it don't stop coming, clogging up the pipes, making me fix the plumbing. - I read out all the lyrics to be about Tech News. So this is gonna take a while, guys. While we're waiting for the Radeon RX 6000 series to launch, AMD has announced a different kind of powerful GPU, the Instinct MI100. No, it's not a gaming card, but it is the first GPU with the company's compute oriented CDNA architecture. It's like RDNA but with a C for compute. You knew that, Dennis. It's obvious. AMD claims the MI100 can reach up to 11.5 teraflops of peak FP64 throughput, which is three times better than its predecessor, the MI50. And it's apparently the first GPU ever to achieve more than 10 teraflops in FP64. But if you're not interested in a card that's primarily designed to solve differential equations, that's understandable. AMD's gaming-focused Radeon RX 6800 will be launching this week and it can apparently be overclocked to 2.5 gigahertz. Meaning it could beat the 2080 Ti even betterer. So get excited, gamers. Lock and load, party up. It's shooting time. Apple really talked up the performance of its Macs powered by the new M1 chip last week. And they're pretty wild claims that say the MacBook Air is faster than 98% of PC laptops, has really gotten the online discussion rolling, to say it kindly. Well, leaked benchmarks may be clarifying the situation a bit. It seems like the M1 does perform very well compared to Intel based Macs, even when running x86 apps through Apple's Rosetta 2 emulation. However, compared to PCs, it's a bit of a different story. When compared to a PC running a Ryzen 5 3600X and a laptop with a Ryzen 7 4800HS, the M1 performs about half as well, according to Cinebench results using a new version with support for Apple's new chip. As usual, we should probably wait for the good legit benchmarks from reviewers, like Linus Tech Tips. I hear they do this stuff pretty well, although I've tried to offer my services and they aren't returning my calls. Apple also rolled out its newest version of macOS called Big Sur last week, which seemed to have sparked a different discussion about Apple's commitment to privacy. The rush of people trying to download Big Sur crashed Apple's Gatekeeper technology, which sends identifiers for each program you run to Apple servers. Suddenly, people were talking about how this means that Apple can tell exactly what you're running, when you run it. But today Apple responded with claims that they only checked to verify if an app contains malware. They don't combine those checks with user identifying information. Apple says they'll also be stepping up encryption for these kinds of checks, and will let users opt out in the future. Well, it sounds like they've got that issue sorted. Although they're still dealing with a lawsuit in Europe over their use of an identifying marker for advertisers being built into iPhones, and the fact that macOS Big Sur is still crashing older MacBooks. But hey, you know, that sandblasted aluminum is feels nice. Now it's time for Quick Bits brought to you by the Manscaped Performance Package Kit, which comes with a ton of stuff. Like their new lawn mower waterproof trimmer with advanced skin safe technology, which helps reduce nicks and cuts, their crop preserver ball deodorant, the weed whacker nose and ear hair trimmer, and the new sheers 2.0 luxury nail kit, because you can't forget about the nailscaping. Dennis? - [Dennis] Yes? - Those cuticles needed some attention. Head to manscaped.com/TECH and get 20% off plus free international shipping today, and you'll get their Shed travel bag, and a pair of their anti chafing boxer briefs available for a limited time. That's so much stuff, it's kinda crazy. You know what, you've worked hard. You deserve some great bits. Nvidia isn't taking AMD's new graphics cards lying down. They're prepping the RTX 3060 Ti to release in January. And if leaked slides are any indication, it's gonna be a good one. Matching the RTX 2080 Super in performance, which is the card I just got a few months ago. And now I'm sad. Nvidia also announced their server-focused A100 GPU will get a memory upgrade, and will be available in the beastly DGX station A100, a system with up to 320 gigabytes of GPU memory. Again, not for gamers, unless your game is laying the groundwork for a humanity-destroying AI. It's great for that one. Runs like a dream. SpaceX already took two astronauts to the International Space Station. But on Sunday the company launched the first fully crewed flight of its Crew Dragon spacecraft, carrying four astronauts into orbit. There are five, I should say. They brought Baby Yoda with them as a Zero G indicator. Space has never been so adorable (laughs) Electric vehicle charging stations that are part of Electrify America's network will soon get an automatic payment feature, just like Tesla's. You just plug in your car, and it handles authentication and billing. Compatible vehicles include the 2021 Porsche Taycans, Lucid Airs and a Ford Mustang Mach-Es. But do any of those companies have eccentric founders that downplay the COVID pandemic? Then what's the point? I'll tell you what though. Don't try to plug in your Chevy Bolt EV, because General Motors is recalling about 70,000 of the 2017 to 2019 models, after a series of instance where batteries malfunctioned and even caught fire. Huh, I think I'll stick to my fireproof gasoline-powered car, thank you very much. And some PS5 owners might be playing the PS4 version of Black Ops Cold War. Since apparently if you download both versions by clicking download all, the console defaults to the older version. You fool! You've been missing out this whole time. What a waste! What a tragedy! Did you beat the game already? Delete it, start over. Actually you might as well return the game and never play games again. Oh, the shame you must feel! I wouldn't wish it on any person, child, pet, or house cactus. And I will feel shame if I continue this episode. So come back on Wednesday for more tech news, and I'll send you the rest of my song.",

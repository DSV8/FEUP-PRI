    "transcript": "(beep sound) - Finally, after all this time, my Blaux Portable AC finally arrived. And it's not even the one I ordered. Great. (techno music) Hey guys, how are you all doing? Really? That's just great. You know I'm doing pretty great today too. If you're new here, welcome. My name is Krazy Ken and I've been following a company named Strong Current Enterprises Limited for the past couple of months. Ever since these air conditioner ads caught my attention, I've been keeping an eye on these guys. And if you haven't seen the first parts of this amazing journey, I recommend checking those out first. In summary, these Blaux ads claimed that this thing was a revolution to the air con industry. (chuckles) So ever since I started doing the episodes about this product, let's just say those ads have been taken care of, I haven't seen many of them lately. In the end, it's just a tiny swamp cooler, it's not an air conditioner by any reasonable consumer standard. So, now here we are. The product finally arrived but it's not the one I ordered, it looks a little bit different. I can't really complain though because I think it actually looks a little bit better than the one I thought I ordered but we'll take a look at that more soon and we'll also see, hey is it worth the near $100 they charge for it. (beep sound) But before we dive into all of that in my tests, here's a little update on the communications I've received from the company. To start, Paula reached back out to me and said, \"I have turned them into avid followers of my blog,\" ahh shucks, you flatter me. But in regards to my past questions, when I asked about who manufactures their product, they couldn't disclose that information, alrighty then. Then I got another email from the Strong Current legal team. They heard that I received my product and asked how it's been. Well, I'm glad you asked. For all intents and purposes, let's just pretend the past stuff didn't happen. It's not a magical device, it's just a tiny swamp cooler. So how well does this thing actually work and is it worth the hundred bucks? Let's dive in. So this product is called the Blaux Classic Desktop AC, I guess. It does look different than the unit on the website and it goes by a different name. And don't be fooled by the shininess, it's not metal, just plastic. There's adjustable vents on the front along with the power knob and there's a built-in blue mood light. On the inside, we have the water curtain and the ice tray. This was another thing that confused me because I don't remember an ice tray being a feature of this product. In fact on the website they just show someone pouring water into the top of the device and that's it but this one works completely differently. I don't know. For this particular model, according to the instructions, you have to soak the water curtain in water and freeze the filled ice tray. At least you get two ice trays so you can freeze the second one while the first one is in use. I found this to be kind of cumbersome because now you have to transport wet things and dripping things in and out of the unit and it's just not very convenient, especially if you have it on like a wooden desk that you're working on and now you're gonna drip water all over it, I don't know. Kind of a bad design but you get what you pay for I guess. No, actually you don't you don't. When you pay almost a hundred bucks, you should have something that's better and less cumbersome than that. Oh, somebody help me. Inside, there's a small fan which, let's be real guys, this doesn't look like it'll be able to push much air. But one thing I couldn't find no matter how hard I looked in this thing, was a pump. Now I'm not sure if the original one I ordered was supposed to have a pump anyway and I can't confirm anything about that cause they didn't send me that one. But my bigger swamp cooler has a pump in it which will take water from the tank, drip it over the water curtain and that's how the water drips down and evaporates, like, it's an evaporative cooler, that's what they're supposed to do. But if there's no pump in here, how does the water, when it gets done in the tank, go back up to the water curtain and drip down and evaporate and cool. Like if there's no pump in there, I don't really understand how it's an effective air cooler at all. Well when I tested it out, it all made sense, it really isn't effective whatsoever. So, I ran it through some tests, let's see how well it did. So I hijacked, borrowed somebody's room for the test site, it's a 12 by 13 room with an eight-foot ceiling. Now keep in mind, I was originally gonna test this thing with summer conditions but because it took so long to arrive, summer is over. So I had to artificially simulate a hot environment, I did the best I could. I cranked the electric baseboard heater to 80 degrees, the highest it would go, and I monitored the temperature. According to my thermometer, the room temperature maxed out at 82 degrees Fahrenheit. But before I could test the Blaux, I needed a control. So I let the room cool and I timed the temperature decrease. Eight minutes in and the room felt about the same and the thermometer read the same temperature. 32 minutes in, the room definitely felt cooler to me and the thermometer read 80. 64 minutes in, the room didn't feel any cooler and the thermometer still read 80 so I imagined this is where it's tapering off. So in short, we could say the room cooled about two degrees in one hour naturally without this thing running. But, now we're gonna turn this thing on and see how well it cools the room. After reheating the room to 82 degrees, I placed the Blaux on the opposite end of the room which is furthest away from the thermometer, just to test the room temperature as best as I could. I inserted the soaked water curtain and ice tray then I cranked it to full power and waited. Now the box says rapid cooling in just 30 seconds so that's why I kinda just arbitrarily chose eight minutes as my first checkpoint. But honestly, while I was running this, I didn't feel anything different eight minutes in, in fact, as I kept going through the checkpoints, the thermometer read the same temperatures as it did in the control when I just let the room cool naturally by itself. So in effect, this wasn't doing anything to cool the room. I placed my hand in front of the unit and the air felt a few degrees cooler than the room temperature. But when I held my hand about three feet away, I couldn't feel the breeze at all. But honestly, what else do you expect from a tiny ass fan? I mean, this fan's smaller than some fans I see in computers, it's not gonna push much air, especially at the speed it's running at. It's not that loud which is kinda nice but that also means it's not really spinning that fast. About 64 minutes in, I noticed no difference, again it was the same as the control and the ice had already completely melted on the inside. So I imagined it's not gonna do much more cooling than it already has done and I felt nothing different. You know, I set really low expectations for this thing and frankly, I'm still disappointed, it's worse than I thought. So now let's simulate an environment where you use it closer to your body. We're not gonna try to cool the whole room, we're just gonna try to cool a little bit of space in front of you, maybe if you use it on a desk or something. So I didn't change anything for this next experiment, I just moved the thermometer about an inch away from the vents, just to try to give it a little bit of a headstart. One inch, it should be able to handle that. Within the eight minutes of cooling, the thermometer dropped from 79 degrees to 70. So it's able to cool quickly at short distances but again, you're not gonna feel the breeze from more than two to three feet away. So if you're lying in bed and you use it on your nightstand, you're not gonna feel it unless you lay close to it, then it might do something or if you put it on your desk like, if it's about this far away, you'll probably feel it so that's probably not a huge problem. But other than that, you're not gonna be able to cool a room with this thing. Which is a pretty big contrast to that bold statement they claimed in that one ad. Now granted they took the ad down, so I'll give you points for that but still wow, what a load of BS. Another problem with this thing is overflowing. I know it says do not overfill but hey, this is Krazy Ken, we have to push the boundaries a little bit here, big mistake. So I put the ice in there, I ran it but then I put another frozen ice tray in there and ran it and, yeah a few minutes in, the tank was overflowing and it was leaking all over the table, I'm just glad I checked frequently because the water was about to drip off the edge of the surface. So if it can't handle two ice trays cause the tray is so small, that means you have to empty out the tray, every time you wanna use it, kinda silly. So aside from waiting two months to receive it, and by the time I did receive it, it was the wrong one, is it worth it? No, of course not. Yes, it can cool the air a little bit but past about three feet, you're not gonna feel much and it's definitely not gonna cool a room. Plus, the ice melts every hour so you have to refill and refreeze the thing every hour and if you do it wrong, it's gonna overflow and leak and it's just kinda cumbersome to have to do that every hour just to get a slight cool breeze. So is it worth that 89 bucks plus tax? No way and that's what the so called 'discount', it's actually valued at $135. Yeah, this thing is valued at $135, makes no sense. And the four-pack is valued at $553. You can get almost two full-size, like window units, 10,000 BTU window air conditioners for that price, there's no way these things are worth that much. That's really fishy. That's it, what else can I say? Just be wary of buying stuff online, you know, don't overpay for this stuff, be cautious of fake reviews and fake ads, just think twice before you buy. And I'm not saying dismiss everything, there's some good legitimate stuff out there, just think a little bit more before you press that buy button. And also, I encourage you to stick around because The Computer Clan is gonna be cranking out some more good tech stuff in the coming weeks as we always do. New tech, vintage tech and of course, knockoff tech. Yeah, I bought this watch, it's just called Watch I guess. It's an Apple Watch knockoff and I cannot wait to see how well that works.

    "transcript": "(bumper go BRRRRRRR) - Ever since I was a young boy, I played the pixel ball. My family was a Macintosh family but when we switched to our first Windows PC, this was the first game I played on it, 3D Pinball Space Cadet. And today, we're gonna get a little nostalgic with it and I'll show you how you can cheat at it, responsibly. (upbeat electronic dance music) Hey guys, how are you all doing? If you're new here, welcome. My name is Krazy Ken. And today we're taking a look at 3D Pinball Space Cadet which is actually more of a demo than a full game. In fact, this table is just one of three tables from the original Full Tilt! Pinball released in 1995. And if you want to know more about that, go check it out on Lazy Game Reviews. So since I have some spare time between my scam busting investigations, I figured I'd bust this iMac out with Windows XP on it, pee on it, and have a little bit of fun. Now I'm sure most of us have played, or at least seen this demo game bundled with Windows before. But how many of you know the cheat code? Let's have some fun with that right now? So here we are in Space Cadet, Windows XP Professional. That's not how you spell professional. Is that a theme thing or is that actually like happening? Okay. So that aside, what you have to do is go to new game or press F2. Now, while the ball is loading up, before it's ready to fire, you have to type hidden space test. There's no text box or anything. You just have to type it out and pray that you did it right. So, let's go ahead and do a new game. H I D D E N space T E S T. So now what you can do is you can click and drag the ball anywhere you want. Now this was made likely for testing purposes but it's still kind of a fun way just to have some fun and wow your friends. So now you can drag it through everything or you can make really annoying sounds. So if we crank this up here, we can just (bumper go BRRRRRRRR) So now we know the bumper works. But now you can hit all of your targets, follow the arrows, follow the lights, and you can see what happens when you do everything in the game. (lasers fire) But we can go even further. You can press H and you get a billion points. Now you can never claim the top rank when you do this trick but it still gives you a billion points, which I think is kind of nice. So we'll just call myself Ken. Hey, I beat Ken, finally! So there you go. I just wanted to get a little nostalgic today because I have some fond memories with this game and the cheat code is pretty fun. Go ahead, wow your friends. You can look like a magician but then tell them what you did. We got to be honest cheaters, right? That makes sense. Feel free to subscribe for more tech episodes coming all the time. And if you liked this episode, you know what to do. Thanks for sticking with me. Catch the crazy and pass it on. (upbeat electronic dance music)",

    "transcript": "- You don't need to prove anything to the Tech News. It loves you, for you! I mean, I think you kind of suck, but, - [Man] Why dislike? (audience laughing) - There was some concern among the PC faithful, that Intel's 13th Gen Raptor Lake processors, which are expected to launch by the end of this year would ditch support for DDR4 memory and require builders to buy newer, younger, sexier DDR5 memory. - [Man] Not everyone's into that. - However, a leaked list of upcoming ASRock motherboards has seemingly confirmed that there will be some DDR4 compatible Raptor Lake boards. Earlier rumors had indicated Intel wasn't a fan of letting DDR4 linger on. But given that Raptor Lake shares the same basic architecture and socket with Alder lake, which does support both memory types, It seems like some other board makers have taken it upon themselves to let people use their perfectly good DDR4 memory. Instead of buying more bits of pricey metal and glass in a supply shortage - [Man] In my day, we fixed things. - Raptor lakes, DDR4 support is especially notable since AMD's Ryzen 7,000 series will not support DDR4 but there may be some hope there too. As leaker greymon55 claims that team red may launch some Zen 4 powered chips on the current AM4 socket, rather than the new AM5, PCIe 5, DDR5 one. So, your old memory sticks might still come in handy after all. Don't put them in the sink, the garbage disposal just yet! - [Man] We call it garburator. - Garburator is a Canadianism. - [Man] I know. The Minecraft community has become engulfed in turmoil over an upcoming update, which could result in players being banned from playing in any online mode including their own private servers and subscription based realms, much of the criticism centers on the fact that any player can report any other player. A setup that could empower trolls, enabling them to abuse the system that was designed to stop abuse. That is a catch 22. - [Man] It might actually, I'm not sure, it might not be. - It might just be ironic. - [Man] Yeah. - But Microsoft says there's nothing to worry about. (laughing) Every player report will be reviewed by moderators, they say. And if players knowingly send incorrect or irrelevant reports, they themselves could in fact be banned and every banned player will be able to file for a case review. Well, it sounds like they formulated the perfect moderation system that has no potential for misuse. - [Man] They got lots of storage for those files. - Finally, somebody note this down, it took a while but we finally made it. - [Man] Huzzah! - And Google really wants Apple to get on board with RCS messaging, but there's another RCS that the tech giant is very much against. RCS labs! An Italian spyware vendor that has been infecting both Android and iOS users with surveillance tools sometimes in collaboration with governments and internet service providers. I don't think the irony of Google warning people about spyware is lost on anyone. But the wild thing about these attacks which occurred in Italy and Kazakhstan, that was noted by Google's threat analysis group, is that they were actually initiated by working with the target's network provider to cut off their mobile data. Then send them a link via text message promising to recover their connectivity by installing an app. But the ISP rep I talked to was so nice. - [Man] They gave me a discount! - It was so nice. (audience laughing) - It's good that Google is getting the word out about these attacks. Even if it is a bit of an example of the pot calling the kettle black to a degree. Now it's time to call these the quac BTUs. - [Man] Sure. - Brought to you by Lakeside software. The digital employee experience management platform that your whole business will love because it collects over 10,000 data points on every endpoint of your IT estate, every 15 seconds. You can use this data to automatically resolve IT tickets and issues, fuel root cause analysis, and proactive IT, and even improve digital employee productivity. And on June 29th, you can join Lakeside for a webinar about organizational productivity, downtime and turnover. So sign up today or learn more about Lakeside software at the link down below. Quickie BTUs are the things in life that remind us to stop talking Riley and get to the good stuff. - [Man] Okay, fine. Geez. - While the crypto crash means hoards of used mining GPUs are being dumped into the market, lowering prices. You may want to exercise some discretion when digging for one to buy. As reports of defective used graphics cards are beginning to surface. Some have been taken apart and reassembled improperly while others have experienced memory failure from the constant pressure of being asked to do calculation after calculation. - [Man] Ugh - You don't know what it's like, man! - [Man] I'm bad at math! - So make sure you perform more than a cursory inspection of that too good to be true eBay listing. You ain't winning any games with fake frames. - [Man] When you have a bad GPU who gives you fake frames. - The US Food and Drug Administration has issued a ban on sales of e-cigarettes manufactured by the once popular Juul. Due to a lack of sufficient data concerning the risks of using the company's products. Juul has obviously appealed the decision, but the news comes after years of debate over the use of Juul's, admittedly putting cool looking vapes by children. - [Man] (laughing) Yeah. - I mean, cool teens everywhere are bound to think this freaking sucks, right? - [Man] No, this is so cool, I thought they were good. - Bungie has sued Nick Minor, a Destiny 2 YouTuber known as Lord Nazo for 7.65 million dollars. After he went on an impersonation rampage sending fake DMCA takedown claims to other members of the Destiny community. The spree was apparently triggered by Minor receiving a DMC takedown request from Bungie, for improperly using music from the Destiny soundtrack. Which does sound like it would be pretty annoying. - [Man] Yeah. - So I kind of get where he is coming from. - [Man] And who of us wouldn't go on a rampage like that. - And the Osam OV1 used to be a promising upcoming Android phone created by some of the engineers behind the essential phone. But now it's a special crypto phone. - [Man] Yeah. - Called the Saga, which will be launched in collaboration with the makers of the Solana cryptocurrency. - [Man] It's special. - The saga will have access to special decentralized apps called dApps. (Man laughing) - Which you can get on a super cool dApp store. More like da app store. - [Man] What? - As in I'm, well I already did a dab - [Man] Oh you did a dab. Yeah. cause I already made the joke before I saw you wrote it. - [Man] Dab on the dApp. - And Amazon has broken the barrier between this life and the next with the announcement that Alexa will soon be able to speak in the voice of a deceased loved one. The virtual assistant will be able to emulate anyone's voice after listening to just one minute of audio which could lead to a wonderfully dystopian future where your child can ask Alexa to read a book, but be grandma. I mean, the people we love, they're never really gone. Are they? They're inside of our Echo. - [Man] Yeah. Inside the device. - In fact, I can still hear them now. - [Man] We trapped them. - They're saying that if you want to hear more tech news you should come back on Monday. - [Man] Grandma?! - Grandma? - [Man] Is that you?",

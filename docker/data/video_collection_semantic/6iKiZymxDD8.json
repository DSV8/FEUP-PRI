    "transcript": "(yelling) - Incredible. Our two computers have been combined, into one. A concept that isn't exactly new. This case, from Cooler Master could have as many as three modules stacked up, each containing it's own PC. And Corsairs, heavy weight Obsidian 10000D, could accommodate both. A primary EATX system and a secondary mini ITX system. Both with full size GPU's. The issue is, both of those solutions are heavy and cumbersome, not to mention that one of the systems is clearly the beta. A dynamic that won't fly in this relationship. We have actually combined his and hers gaming systems before though, using virtualization. The issue is that the cost advantage of sharing components, like the mother board and power supply, ended up being out weighed by the draw back of running against anti-cheat solutions that will falsely flag virtualization users for cheating. Bringing us to the better solution. A fast, relatively easy mod, that allows the Cooler Master NR200P to fit two full fat gaming rigs. Not fat, like performance gaming rigs. All they need is a little nip and tuck. Ready? Let's go. (metal clanking) (wrench ticking) Goodbye dead weight. (metal clanking) Now, all we need is to remove these three rivets. (screwdriver whirring) And as long as I don't screw this up. (metal clanking) We should be good to go. Just like I'm good at telling you about our sponsor. - Ridge. Ridge wallet has redefined the traditional, big fat, receipt filled wallet, with it's compact frame and RIFD blocking plates. The bulge in your pants, shouldn't be from your wallet. Use offer code Linus to save 10%, and get free worldwide shipping. (upbeat music) - Here's the idea, we're each going to disassemble our case in a similar fashion, keeping behind only the parts that we need to mount our mother board, power supply, storage, cooling, and GPU. Then, we're gonna take our two L shaped pieces and, you guys can see where I'm going with this. Two computers will be like this. - Okay. - Yeah. Oop, that's a little saggy. The case. (both laugh) The case. - Hey I'm not the only one that sags. We're getting old. (screwdriver clicking) Kay, I've done three screws, in the time you've taken to find one. We're never going to get done. - Okay and then you should be able to pop. - And then you should (metal clanking) (both exclaim) - Sorry - There's probably going to be some Floatplane exclusive out takes and cutting room floor stuff on Floatplane.com. That intro is almost certainly going to be in there. - It's really cute. - Super cute. - There you go. - Wild, right? Obviously, a project like this raises a number of questions. With the first one being, how do you turn these things on? - You just stroke gently. - I don't. (slow romantic music) - Okay, no, the computer. And we do have the answer to that. Because, obviously, our integrated power and reset switches are no longer part of our cases. We had to pick up a couple of these little, Owltree brand external power and reset switches and just double sided tape them to the side of the power supply holder. - It's not very pretty looking. - It still needs love. - Oh, oh I was going to be like, where's my motherboard? Cause I was expecting something so big, but it's so tiny. - That's what she said. As I eluded to before, both of these systems need to be similarly powerful. So we're using identical mother boards. This is a B550-I gaming from ASUS ROG Strix line up. (plastic rattling) And because we have some thermal concerns, packing two such systems into a tiny, ITX case that's intended for one, we've gone with a reasonable Ryzen 5 5600 CPU. I mean to be clear, that's still 6 cores. That's a lot of performance. It's just not a ton of heat, compared to something like a 12 or 16 core variant. - Yvonne's going to show us how an AMDC CPU is installed. - I don't think they want to follow my guide, I'm pretty sure they want to watch you. All right, there, it's in. - [Linus] Are you sure? - [Yvonne] Actually, it's really hard to tell. You have to confirm? - I can feel it, it's in. - Can you? - Yeah, you touch enough CPU's, you can tell when they're in. Next up, let's do storage. We actually got a number of options for M.2SSD installation. I'm going to take the lazy route and not bother to access this one down here, and I'm going to install this crucial P5 onto the back of our mother board. - [Yvonne] I've never seen this before. - [Linus] Like the rear mounted kind? - [Yvonne] Yeah. - [Linus] Yeah. Now things are about to get really interesting, because these are packed in so tight. We can't go just installing our memory, and our heat sink willy nilly, everything has to go together in a very specific order. So, we're each going to take our half cases, and put the mother board in. - Okay. I can't get mine in. - Not like that. - What? - You gotta go slow first, then fast, when you're screwing. - I don't know if people should take advice from you about screwing. I'm sorry Brandon. - [Brandon] You guys are making my job very hard. - Next up is power supplies. These don't match strictly speaking, but they are functionally the same. We're both using SFX power supplies. So these are the slightly shorter version that have only 92mm, rather than 120mm fans, but that was necessary for us because, even though we have the power supply cage, in the SFX L position this way, there's just not a ton of clearance for our modular interface here to keep them from interfering with other stuff, so, we're stuck with SFX L. - Okay, so do they go in this way? - You want your fan going towards the open back part here. That way it will draw nice fresh air from the outside of the case, because let me tell ya, the air inside this case is not going to be nice, and not going to be fresh. We've gone with some Crucial Ballistix 3200 Mega transfer per second, CL16 modules that you can't even buy anymore. So maybe we'll have some other more different ramblings in the video description, along with the rest of the components we're using. - So I watched Bella's video. Did you actually use this to cut open a box? - Yeah. - Is that okay? - I mean. - That doesn't ruin the contacts or anything? - Did the box open? Did the RAM work? - Yeah. - Then it's okay. - All right, okay. - Do as I say, not as I do, and I'm saying don't do that. You can see here why we were going to have a pretty hard time plugging in those front panel connectors if we had the RAM installed already. Things are getting pretty tight in here. - I don't know why it's messed up. - Not like that. - No, why? What? What's wrong? - Yeah, you got it like that. That's good. Yeah, that's good. - I don't know if I want to talk to you any more, after this. - Well you don't need to talk. - Oh. - I love that with modern systems you don't have to run, sata data, sata power, and all your drives anymore. So we only need three cables for these builds. Our 24 pin for the mother board. Our 8 pin for, also the mother board, but it powers the CPU. And then PCI express for the GPU. That's it. It makes these kinds of small form factor builds, so much easier to cable manage. For our CPU cooler, we've actually got a new comer to the channel. I had never heard of ID cooling before, but thanks to those helpful, very helpful lists, that the SFF community have compiled, that tell us the exact height of basically every cooler on the market, we found this was as close as we could get to our 70mm of clearance, while still having a little bit of room to still draw in some fresh air, and I guess we'll give it a shot. We did replace the stock slim fan, with a Noctua fan, just to get a little bit more performance out of it. And in terms of orientation, we're going to have our heat pipes up toward the top of the board. Which, hopefully we can just kind of put it on there, for now. Puts our fan right over top of our RAM stix, giving us a little bit of extra cooling, which they will need. Yeah do you wanna goop me? - Yeah. - Need more right there. - I thought it was supposed to be a grain of rice? - Needs more goop, you can never have too much goop. - I'm pretty sure you can have too much goop. - She was so innocent when I met her. - Just defiled me. - Wow, come on, defiled. - So there's three of them, does it matter which one it goes in? - Do the gray one. - The gray one. Why is it the gray one? Why not the black one? - Because if you put it in the wrong one, it'll complain. That is actually the answer, if you turn it on, it'll say CPU fan speed zero press F1 to whatever. - Now I plug things in. - Let's go ahead and to our 24 pin connector. Oh boy, we are going to want to keep this, as tight as we possibly can. It's kinda like that. This is a cool feature of this case. It has little cable management anchors on the side of the power supply cage, here. Not that I think I can even get in there well enough to actually use them, but it's a great idea in theory. Now, we're going to plug in one of the GPUs. So who goes first? - Me. - No? There's no rock, paper, scissors? No debate? - No, you just said who goes first, and I said me. - We've gone with an RTX 3060 XLR8 from PNY, and the main reason for that is it's. - Tiny. - Super cute. It's got a large, what appears to be a 110mm fan on it. Wow, that's awesome for a tiny little mini ITX card. Also, this is a nice little benefit. All of the IO is in a row here which means that we're actually going to kick a substantial amount of the heat from this GPU out of the case. Though, we will be kicking some of it into the case. Which means we're going to have to deal with that, with some case fans. It's nice that this case uses all of the same screws for absolutely everything. So we just have a pile of them and when it's time to put it all back together, there's no fussing about with like, oh what kind of counter sunk there, or phillips number one, phillips number two. Yeah this is great. Every screw head actually does have a purpose, except slot, (explicit deep) slot. - But you can use like a dime to turn them. - No you should always just have a screw driver in your back pocket, lttstore.com. You don't necessarily have to use exactly this GPU, if you were to try to recreate this build, as long as you find one that is exactly the length of the mother board, or I mean less would be fine, you should be good to go. This is where things start to get a little bit tricksy. You ready? - Your cable is in the way. - Okay, this is crap. - No, no, no, the cable. - Everything about it is crap. - No, no, no, it was working, the cable at the bottom there was in the way. - [Penguin] I gotta recommend doing it flat again, like. - No, no, no, we got this. - [Penguin] Okay. - Oh. - This is definitely the better way. - Okay, something sounded bad. We good? - I mean. - Have we merged? - Good is a strong word. Oh my God. Okay, well the thread has to actually catch though - It did catch. - Oh no, no you're. - What? - You're cross threading it. Oh my gosh. - I'm just bothering you. - They're all over the place here. Look how crooked that is. - Well if you. - No, get the close up, don't let her hide this. No, you can't hide it. - If you would hold it straight, then maybe it would go in straight. - I don't know. Watch out, watch out, watch out. - No, what are you doing, babe? Fine. - Ow. - Am I supposed to be helping with this, or not? - I don't know. It's hard for me to tell quite honestly. Okay we can tighten them now. - Okay. - Oh, oh yes, right there. Okay? So you just need to hold it in the right spot. Nice. Screws are in. - All right. - GPU time? Then this goes in right, they butt right up against each other. - Wow, this is compact. - Yep, it really does not get much tighter then that. Which is why we need some cooling fans. One tricky thing at this stage is that, because we used two half of the case, there's no longer anywhere for this to clip in, and we can't use a bottom panel anymore. So we have to make a bottom panel, out of one of our top panels. And the quickest, and easiest way to do that, is to just bend these little mesh tabs here. And this is going to go on a little something like, that. What's really nice, is that because there's no spare random cables here, while we are going to use fan grills we're going to use them facing outward. We don't need to worry about any of the cables, you know, sticking in our spinning fan blades or anything like that. We can plug this in now. That'll power both of our fans off of my mother board, so that is one slight down side. Both of the systems should be powered on to ensure that both of them will be adequately cooled. And that's basically just providing intake air for these GPUs. - Wow. - Like that's it. They completely block the air flow from, really any other part of the system. Which means, when it's time to install our slim fans, on our second panel, we're actually going to want those as intakes, as well. And then we're counting on the open ends of the case, to help us passively push out all the extra air. This time we get to keep our mesh. Which is a little nicer for keeping dust out of the system. Okay. Bu dunk, bu dunk, bu dunk. Woo, pretty cool. Oh yes, we did screw up one little thing. The bottom needs feet. Cause otherwise, these fans are not going to be in taking much of anything. Again, for the three of you, who are planning to replicate this build, these little rubber feet are from Amazon, they're the 13mm tall feet, and they're available for just a few bucks. One thing that I would like to do, if I did this again is, maybe add some mesh in front of these, of some sort. Like instead of using regular grills, maybe use filters. That will keep a little bit of the dust out of the case. (metal clanks) - There we go. - It's like a two headed goat, you know? You're just like, where does it poop from? It's confusing. The confusing PC. Out of the gate, we're going to start with my favorite game, Bios updating. What could go wrong? You multiply your risk, it's great. This CPU was running about 6 degrees hotter, but also turboing about 500 MHz higher. - I mean technically that's fine. You play more games than I do, so I could just take this, and we don't have to do this. - Well yeah but we specifically went out of our way, to make this system one, and this system A. So nobody has to feel like number two, you know? - I don't care, I just want it to work. - No. - I just want to play my game. - Well it isn't working. - But it is working. - No, if it's not working optimally, it's not working. - Oh my gosh. And this is why nothing ever gets done. (laughs) - We are going to play Halo Infinite. Let's do team doubles. - Okay. - Okay. (hands slap) We got this right? - Well I don't know what I'm doing. I don't even know what this game is. - It's a shooter, you point at the bad guys, and they fall down. - Okay. - Okay. You ready? Okay. - What am I doing? - So just stay close to me. - Okay. - And if someone kills me, shoot at them. I don't actually know the objective of this. Of there's a hill. - What's this? - Did I just? What just happened? - I don't know, did you just die? - What do you mean die? No I didn't die. I was disconnected. - Oh. - Multi player is unavailable try again. (slams table thud) And you wonder why nobody is playing this game. - Oh, I died. I'm not good, oh I killed someone. - Wow, you just got, No, not now. - Sorry. - Oh, ah. (both laugh) - You just got another kill. Surprisingly it's not really any worse than a typical gaming system. If anything, I'd say it's probably on the quiet side. That's really impressive. One small note by the way, we ended up reversing these top fans. We're using them as an exhaust now. The difference in temperatures was a few degrees, but the way it ended up working out, our intake at the bottom ended up a lot more effective in getting air past those GPUs than I expected. So, we ended up not needing to draw more fresh air in, but rather just get rid of some of the heated air. I've got blenders set to use both CPU and GP. (beep) Okay, here we go, three, two, one. And they're off. Okay, CPUs at 100, GPUs at about 90. This should give us a pretty good idea of what the system will look like under full synthetic load. - Realistically, in gamer, are you actually going to get to full load like this? - No. - Then why would you test it? - You want to make sure that it is prepared for the worst case scenario. - My CPU is running a lot lower than yours. - Ah. - 75 to 68, - Yeah it's also not turboing as high still, which is weird. I wonder if you just got a not as good chip. We'd have to actually take the CPU out and put it in my board and see if it's maybe just slightly better behavior out of my board to know for sure, but. Okay, you did end up with the beta system, after all our efforts. - Awe. - Sorry, it is entirely unintentional, for real though. Does anyone need to save space that badly? - Yeah, what are you talking about? The apartment's and condos now are super tiny. - Yeah but you could just build two regular ITX systems, and put one on top of the other, you know? You already had to buy two cases anyway. - It's super cute though. - It is cute. - Oh, and when you go to a LAN party, now you just take one computer with you. - Yes, that assumes that your SO actually goes to the LAN party with you. Otherwise, it's an inconvenience because now I've taken your computer away. - That's true. Hey, I came to your LAN party. - Okay, I think we can pretty much call that good. These are not going to overheat. Unlike our relationship. And the segway to our hot sponsor. - Oracle. Oracles CloudWorld event is happening from October 17th to the 20th, in Las Vegas, Nevada.

    "transcript": "- Hey guys, its Justine. And today, I just wanted to kind of talk to you guys about some of the things that have been going on with Apple recently, obviously, you know, the iPhone 13 came out last month. The apple watch just recently got released and I never even gave you guys an update on which one I decided to go with. In my review unit, I had the green version and I decided to go with the Starlight. So check that out. I decided to do the Starlight because this gold phone is not really that gold, so I kind of wanted them to match. So that's the current setup that we have going on. But this video today, I actually partnered with Rhinoshield. So thank you guys so much for partnering with me on this video. I thought this video was going to be like a simple: 'Hey, check out my cool Rhinoshield iPhone case. It's going to protect you from drops and your daily impacts. They have tons of colors. They've got all sorts of customization', which yes, that is all very, very, very true. But what I didn't realize is that they were going to send me so many cases to show you guys. Just hold on a second. We might need to zoom out here because I don't think they're all going to fit. What are you guys..? Do you?, wooooow Oh we're not done yet. This is amazing. Where's my phone even at? Here it is. They also have 3D impact screen protectors to go with the phone cases. They even have exclusive collections with the NBA, NASA, league of legends and Pac-Man, they have a variety of colors of prints that you can mix and match with your style. And you can also design your own case with photos, names, or texts. And they even have Apple watch and AirPods cases that you can customize to match your phone. They now have these all available for the iPhone 13. And if you have an Android, they also have them for Android phones as well. They have a lifetime warranty for all of their cases. They ship worldwide and they have free shipping on qualified orders. They even have this really nice USB-C to lightning braided cable. They seriously have so many different combinations. And I think the one that I am going to settle on is this one it's kind of subtle, but I like this a lot because it has the protective back on it, but I can still see the gold color. And obviously this is one of my favorite colors and the pink also matches the AirPods case. They do have a couple of different options for these backs because this one actually isn't MagSafe compatible. So you do want something that is Magsafe. They do have one of the clear protectors that is much thinner. So you'll still be able to use Magsafe. I feel like I definitely need to do one of the custom cases and put Maddy on it. I'll put a link in the description where you guys can learn more about Rhinoshield for the iPhone 13, and you can use my code: iJUSTINE13 at checkout for 20% off of the first week and then 10% off afterwards. So like I said, the iPhone has been out for almost a month now. It's kind of crazy to think that that month has actually gone by so quickly. But for the most part, iOS 15 has probably been one of my favorite iOS releases. I did make a video talking about some of my favorite features in iOS 15, but the one that I loves so much is actually the focus mode. I was surprised that I liked this as much as I did because one of the things that was so shocking to me was to be able to pick up my phone and not see a single notification. My phone is constantly being bombarded with notifications all day long. So to be able to set a focus mode when I'm sleeping, when I'm working, or just when I don't want to be disturbed has been so cool. So we upgraded my mom to an iPhone 13 and she was getting an upgrade from the iPhone 11, which honestly isn't that huge of an upgrade. But even she noticed how much better the camera quality is. These, she is always taking photos of the dogs and our little niece. And it's so funny because the first thing that she said is like, wow, like this ultra wide camera, it's so much more clear. And I'm like, yeah, it is. My dad has the iPhone 12, which we did recently upgrade him to before the iPhone 13 came out and my grandmother, we upgraded her to the iPhone 13 pro. We didn't get her the pro max because she was coming from the iPhone 7, actually. So to go from that to the 13 was such a huge upgrade for her. So Gram, I hope you're enjoying your new iPhone. Wait, oh my God, wait a minute. ProRes is actually out in the beta. I didn't even show that to you guys. So this is my .....beta phone and to be able to access the ProRes, all you have to do is go in and turn on the ProRes when it's actually out. There It is. Apple....freakin ......ProRes. So you just turn it on. Like you turn on the ProRes for the photos it's in the formats under video. I am currently running the beta. So that's why I do have access to it. It's much like shooting photos here. You'll see, you can turn the RAW on and off. And when you go into the video, it also does the same kind of feature. You just click the ProRes here on and off. So on this phone, it says that I can have a max recording time of 149 minutes. I can't believe I actually forgot about the ProRes That's going to have to be a separate video, but I do plan on really testing that out, especially with the new Mac books that were announced. As many of you have seen the new M1 pro and M1 X, Max, no. M1 Max, Oh, geez. I'm gonna be doing this. I keep messing up the names, the M1 pro and the M1 Max, those are the two new chips for the two new Mac books. We have the 14 inch MacBook and the 16 inch Mac book pro. And I'm so excited about this because the M1 chip as they're transitioning away from the Intel chips. So really seeing firsthand over the last year, how powerful the M1 Mac book 13 inch was. I honestly cannot even wrap my mind around how powerful these new micro pros are going to be. And again, it sucks because I'm the type of person that really struggles to enjoy the now, because I'm already thinking ahead. I mean, as soon as that M1 Mac book came out, I was like, oh my gosh, I cannot wait for the next version. Like, what is the 16 inch going to be like? What are these next chips going to bring us? And now I'm already thinking like, okay, if this is what you have crammed into these Mac books, what are you freaking going to do when you come out with a new iMac Pro or a new Mac Pro Tower? Like it's going to be honestly, so mind blowing that I was sitting there watching the keynote and I was getting excited to do work. I was getting excited to edit and I am somebody who actually really loves to edit. So like the filming process being in front of the camera is fun. Like, I really like it because it's a part of the storytelling process. But for me, man, when you get into that editing, that's where I shine. But since it is my YouTube channel and I'm in it, I also have to be in the videos too kind of, it's like, hold on a second. How do I wear so many hats? So the iPhone has been incredible. I'm so excited to test out ProRes. I'm so excited that I actually forgot about it because it's not in my main phone because I do have the beta running on my secondary device just in case because I don't like to run betas on my main phones anymore only because it is a beta and I'm sure there's nothing wrong with it, but I do just like to be extra cautious and run it on something that isn't my main phone. So the Apple watch as it updates, like I said, I ended up going with a Starlight and it actually matches kind of like my new aesthetic here. What do you guys think of the new desk? Are you excited about my new studio? I can not wait. I'm actually working on a full build-out. So I'm kind of in this weird temporary transition because I wanted to film in it, but yet, like it's not ready to be seen and we don't really have it all set up yet, but it's been a pretty exciting process. I mean, I actually was there from the very beginning of building this, like I was in this studio when the walls weren't even up, there were a bunch of like outlets and stuff over here. I was like, you got to get rid of the outlets. Those can't be there because I need to have this beautiful white wall. We can't be messing it up with outlets. Anyway, that's gonna be coming soon. I know a lot of you guys who have been watching my videos and following me for a really long time may remember the old days of the white wall. So in my review version, I had the green Apple watch. So the green was a much darker green than I thought and all of the press materials, it looked like it was a lot lighter. And when I first unboxed that, I was like, ah, oh my goodness, this is dark, but I really liked the color. But for me, I definitely wanted to have kind of this lighter look. And the Starlight is just really nice. Like, I can't actually figure out what color this is. It seems like it's mostly silver. Like, I don't think that I would really say that this is a gold color, but it really does match the back of the gold iPhone 13. Normally during my apple watch reviews, I'm super active, but for some reason I don't know what I did, but I hurt my knee. And during the review I was doing a run like my knee gave out. I was like, what is happening? Do I have arthritis? Do I need to go get surgery? Like what's what is going on? During the pandemic I basically became a runner and it was so much fun. I really enjoyed running. And now I'm I'm concerned. So thank you to everyone on Twitter who gave me some tips to help rehab this, to help reduce inflammation. I was like, oh my God, do I even need to go to a doctor? No, I just need to be on Twitter. So you also, might've seen in my apple recap video that they came out with three new colors of the HomePod mini. They have this yellow, this orange, and like this midnight blue kind of color. Now the HomePod mini is honestly pretty impressive. I loved, they were showing like these demos of you can just like, bring your phone close to it. And if you use the new voice music subscription, so they have like this new tier now for apple music and I call it the voice plan. So really you just use your voice. And I think this is a great plan for people who might have a HomePod and they just want to have Apple music and have access to playlists. I basically just tell Siri to play music. That's mostly how I use my HomePod, but of course, if you do want to make your own curated playlist, if you do want to have the spatial audio and the lossless audio, but since I do have the Apple 1 subscription and a family plan, I already do have the full Apple music bundle in with that. But I really liked this as an option for people who just buy a HomePod. And they're like, I don't really need all of those other features. I just want to use my HomePod, listen to music and use this as kind of the home kit enabler for my home. Home kit enabler. Its what we're going to call it. So the thing that I really am most excited about is testing out these, get outta here, bug. I know these lights are very enticing, but this is my place. I am here. Not you. I'm so excited to test out the new M1 MacBook pros. I was really having this debate, like, do I want to get the 16 inch or do I want to stick with the 14 inch? Because the 13 inch Macbook, it was just a little bit too small, but having the 14 inch would be slightly bigger, but it would be still smaller than the 16 inch. But man, having that extra screen real estate is going to be so nice. And then I had the dilemma of, do I want the silver or do I want the space gray? And in the timeframe that it took me to purchase the Macbook that I wanted, I did end up going with the completely specked out space gray with eight terabytes of storage space. Oh God. So excited. I put both the silver and the space gray into my cart. And I was like, okay, which one do we want? And then my sister and I were having this text chat back and forth, trying to figure out what we wanted. And then we decided to both go with the space gray. I mostly chose the space gray because the keyboard now is all like it's fully black. There's no, see-through like, you don't see the keys, like a 13 inch Mac with now. You can actually see through it. So there's like a space gray kind of slow roll, really aluminum that you can see. Whereas this one is just, the whole keyboard is dark. So I thought if I want to have that kind of blend in a little bit more with the entire case, like maybe I'll just do the space gray, honestly, I don't even know, but I took too long to order. And now my order is being pushed to the beginning of December. That's going to be a very Merry Christmas early gift to myself at the beginning, which is summer when I get this thing in anyway, just want to give you guys an update on some of my thoughts of what's been happening in the world of Apple and me personally, I haven't been posting as much as I normally do. Some of you may have noticed, but there's been a lot of stuff going on over here in this camp, like getting a new studio, traveling back and forth to visit my family and just so many other little things. Like I don't really vlog anymore. So I don't really share my entire life with you guys. Like I used to. So it's kind of crazy because I feel like I'm living this like whole secret life over here because I don't post everything online anymore. And now freaking dealing with like this knee injury it's taking away my energy outlet of being able to work out. So I'm just, I'm very sad about it. So I'm hoping that this heals up quickly and I can get back to doing all of my activities. Again, thank you guys for all of your healing tips and all of your well-wishes.

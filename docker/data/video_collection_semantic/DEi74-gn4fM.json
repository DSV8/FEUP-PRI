    "description": "The ASUS NovaGo is a laptop whose design would have looked dated even a decade ago. Its clunky, its dull, and it lacks basic amenities like a backlit keyboard. But its a much more significant machine than it might appear. The NovaGo is one of the first Always Connected PCs, a new category of notebook that makes two huge promises: an always-on internet connection; and a battery that can go 20 hours on a charge. Sadly, the ASUS NovaGo only delivers on one of those -- and it asks a lot of sacrifices in exchange.   [SUBSCRIBE TO MRMOBILE]     [ABOUT MRMOBILE'S ASUS NOVAGO REVIEW]  MrMobile's ASUS NovaGo Review was produced following approximately two months with an ASUS NovaGo review unit (model TP370QL). The device received many software updates during the review period through the Windows Update service.   Disclosure: In a recent Instagram integration, MrMobile was sponsored by Qualcomm to promote the launch of the Always-Connected PC line at the Microsoft Store. That paid sponsorship was not related to this video review; nevertheless, as it might tend to cause the appearance of a conflict of interest, it is disclosed here.     [FOLLOW UP]   I spoke with a product manager at Qualcomm today who shed some light on a few of my reported issues, and I wanted to share them with all of you!  BATTERY LIFE: According to Qualcomm, there's a known issue affecting Windows 10 laptops that include fingerprint sensors. This issue cropped up following a recent update, and it prevents these devices from sleeping when closed (it does not appear to be unique to devices running on the Snapdragon platform). This may be the source of my battery drain problem, which was not widely reported on other ACPCs. A Windows Update is due to fix the issue \"in a few days.\"  CAMERA LAUNCH PROBLEM: Qualcomm has not been able to reproduce my issue on its own units, and I have yet to see another report of the same problem. It may well be unique to my device, which, as mentioned in the video, is a preproduction NovaGo.   PERFORMANCE: Qualcomm says the general sluggishness I experience during use is abnormal, and it was suggested that some of the apps I'm using (which include titles such as Slack and Evernote) may be contributing factors. I intend to test another NovaGo and the HP Envy x2 to see if newer units perform better. Given what I've seen from other reviews, though, I tend to think my experience is rather typical. Additional testing with a new device will tell.  OVERALL VALUE: I asked the question many of you have: why buy an ACPC right now, given 1) the looming launch of the more-powerful Snapdragon 850, and 2) the existence of beefier notebooks that also include 4G (for example, the Surface Pro LTE). Qualcomm's response was to reinforce the Always-Connected PC's key benefits: an ACPC wakes up faster; it stays connected all the time; it lasts long enough to go a whole weekend on a charge.   From my perspective, these are indeed compelling features - a notebook that offers all the advantages of a smartphone would basically be my perfect device. As of yet, though, I haven't had that experience with my own NovaGo review unit. I'll move into my new review device shortly, and will report back on my experience with both that new NovaGo, and the HP Envy x2 ACPC.  More questions? Drop 'em here!

    "transcript": "- [Michael] The ASUS NovaGo would've looked dated even a decade ago. It's clunky, it's dull, and it lacks basic amenities like a backlit keyboard. But, it's a much more significant machine than it appears. This is one of the first always-connected PCs, a new category of notebook that makes two huge promises: an always-on Internet connection and a battery that can give you 20 hours of use on a charge; sadly, this machine only delivers on one of those, and it asks a lot of sacrifices in exchange. (upbeat optimistic electronic music) Before we get to the hard times, let's touch on the one big win here. Thanks to a mobile processor with a builtin modem, the NovaGo is, indeed, always connected to a cellular network of your choice. Over the past two months I've used it on AT&T and T-Mobile, and there's a pretty great Sprint deal, too. I'll touch on that at the end. Point is, ya stick a SIM card in there, and this thing connects to 4G LTE just as quickly as your phone does. That means you don't need to drain your phone's battery with a mobile hotspot, ya don't need to run the risk of connecting to a dodgy public WiFi network, ya don't need to fiddle with VPNs. Your laptop is already connected, because it's always connected, all the time. It even stays connected in standby, so when ya open it, your notifications are there waiting for you. It's hard to convey how much a relief that kind of convenience is, and I believe it's the future of computing. The problem is, at least on this machine, Windows isn't quite ready for that future. See, it's not easy for a desktop operating system to run on a processor designed for a phone. In this case, that processor is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, which uses a different architecture than the Intel chips you're used to seeing on PCs. So Microsoft had to build an entirely different version of Windows to run on this architecture. The result is... Well, remember the Surface laptop I reviewed last year? If that were an F-15 fighter, the ASUS NovaGo would be a Sopwith Camel. Maybe just a camel. What I'm saying is, this thing is slow. Sure, we expected some sluggishness; this isn't a gaming machine, and older programs need to be interpreted by the emulator, but I wasn't expecting an added half-second of lag after almost every interaction. I even tried ditching Google Chrome for Microsoft Edge for my browsing, and doing a lot of work in the browser, but none of it helped shake the sense that this machine is always just kinda half asleep. Ya know what? I'd have forgiven that if the computer had lived up to its second promise: 20-hour battery life. On my best run, it did get close. Starting with a full charge, I worked for about four and a half hours straight, and when I finished, I still had 84% left, with an estimated 12 and a half hours remaining. But, it only happened that once. In fact, the past few times I've woken it from standby after leaving it overnight at about half charge, the thing has been almost dead, having drained itself almost dry. I should say my machine came from an early-manufacturing batch. So, that could be a part of the problem. If you're not already down in the comments suggesting that an update might help my issues, I'll save ya the trouble. I've gotten tens of Windows updates in my time with this machine, like more than 20. If you thought they take a long time on a regular PC, wait 'til you use one of these. These updates have not solved the battery inconsistency or responsiveness problems. The machine does feel a little faster than it did a few weeks ago, but now I have new interesting bugs to contend with. No matter how many little things I like about this computer: the fingerprint sensor, or the tablet mode, or, actually, that's about it, those endurance and responsiveness problems are a showstopper for me. Factor in the dim display, the lack of USB-C, the miserable speakers, I just can't recommend this machine. Try to go out on a highpoint here. The most exciting thing about this computer might be the Sprint plan you can get with it. No, Sprint isn't a sponsor; it's just a pretty good deal. If ya bought one today, you'd get unlimited data on Sprint for free, through the end of the year. But at a monthly price of 15 bucks, you're only really saving $75 total. Given the NovaGo's retail price, well, let's just say there are better options for a longlasting always-connected device than this computer. - What's a computer? (tinny funky music) - [Michael] I still believe the always-connected PC is the future of computing, and I'm hopeful that the HP Envy x2 will do better. From what Daniel Rubino at Windows Central has told me, it's at least faster. If you'd like to see my review of that device, drop a comment down below. And make sure you're subscribed to theMrMobile on YouTube so you don't miss it. Until next time, thanks for watching, and stay mobile, my friends.",

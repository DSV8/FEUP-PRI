    "transcript": "- [Narrator] This video is about Google Assistant, and Alexa. It's somewhat a different format from what we usually do, but don't worry, I'll be your narrator, and help guide you through it. Sorry about the audio, it is CES. (lighthearted music) - It's CES 2019, things are winding down like they do, and whenever things wind down, you gotta start picking winners, and losers. This show is a really big intelligent assistant fight, and so it's obviously gonna be Google versus, (chuckles) well not pic speed, but maybe Alexa, and I don't know Shannon, I'm looking at this thing here and I think Google's kinda got, run it away. - I don't think so Dieter, I think this is just a sign you know, it's just Google trying to make big show but when you think about Smart Home Assistance, it's honestly obviously gonna be Alexa. Like, Alexa's in like almost every gadget out there. - Okay, they're in every gadget out there, but there's no hype. So like you, (stammers) you can just go out and find every Alexa gadget, and prove it I guess. That is your job now, you're welcome. - No, I don't think so. (Dieter laughing) That's like too many gadgets. Let me just narrow it down to like the coolest, and weirdest Alexa gadgets, how does that sound? - Weirdest? I think I could find weirder gadgets that support the Google Assistant than you can find weird gadgets that support Alexa. - That sounds like a bet, that sounds like a challenge. - Okay, what are the stakes? - Pride, and the satisfaction of winning. - (sighs) I do like being right. Okay, one hour. - Alright. - Go. - [Narrator] And our competitors are on the way to see who can find (stammers), oh wait. - I think I went the wrong way. - Yeah, I definitely went the wrong way. Alright, you know what? This is gonna be a piece of easy, Google's got this huge booth right here. I'm gonna be able to find everything I need and not have to go anywhere, it's gonna be awesome. - [Narrator] Dieter thinks he'll find most of what he needs right here at Google's booth. You could see how confident he is by how he's walking up the stairs. Meanwhile, Shannon is taking a different route. - I'm gonna call a Lyft, and hopefully they can pick us up here even though the traffic is super bad in Las Vegas right now. - [Narrator] While Shannon waits for her ride, Dieter is close to finding his first product. - So everything is here, and I think my opening entry, the first thing we'll start with is the Lenovo Smart Clock 'cause it's so small, and cute, and little. - [Narrator] Seems like it's not that easy to find. Looks like traffic wasn't too big of an issue, and Shannon made it to her destination. - [Shannon] Hey they let us through without bag check, that's pretty good. - [Narrator] But it looks like Dieter is ahead. - I have a whole wall of gadgets here, and this little dude right here is the Lenovo Smart Clock. It is just itty bitty, and tiny, and it's got little volume buttons on the top. It's like a little wedge lookin' dude, and when the alarm goes off, it lights up, and gets bright to wake you up in the morning. - [Narrator] Good one, Dieter. Not super weird, but solid. Let's check in with Shannon. - So Ring is owned by Amazon, and this doorbell works with Alexa. It's the Ring Doorview Cam, and it goes over your peephole, it's pretty cool. I think it's pretty cool, I think I just won the competition. (laughs) But I don't know. - [Narrator] I'll be the judge of that. (lighthearted electronic music) - Really, Shannon? You're comin' to me with a doorbell? Come on, this right here, this is a E ink screen. It's a thing that you power with a Google Assistant, but it doesn't run the Google Assistant. It's a new thing called Google Assistant Connect, and you could have it show you the weather, the calender, or whatever. You can stick it onto your fridge, and it's just a prototype for now but you know, it's 3-D printed, who doesn't love 3-D printed things? Ha! - [Narrator] Okay, that's better. But it looks like Shannon found something else worth looking at. - I've just found U By Moen's shower that turns on with Alexa. However like, Google Assistant is coming later in the year, so is Apple Home Kit, I don't if that counts, I mean, is that cheating? What do you think? Alexa, turn on my shower. - [Narrator] The remote is cheating. - Alexa, turn on the shower. (lighthearted electronic music) - Okay a shower, that's really good. But you know what I have here? An exhaust fan run in Android 8. It is called the Hub GE, and it does support the Google Assistant, (hums) and you can also like, control the fan, or you can even get a camera that shows your stove top so you could do a video call with somebody, and they will see exactly what it is you're cooking. Check (claps) mate (claps). - [Narrator] That's pretty impressive, I've got to admit. - I mean, I don't want to get too cocky about this, but I'm pretty sure I got it, and I'm pretty Shannon headed over to the Sands Convention Center for her stuff. So I'm gonna go over there, and let her know that I won. (lighthearted electronic music) - [Narrator] But Shannon decides to wait to reveal her final item when Dieter arrives at the Sands expo. - So Shannon, I've got a exhaust fan that goes over a stove that's actually just an Android 8.1 tablet that supports Google Assistant. Pretty sure I got this, what do you got? - I don't think so, I've got a toilet. - Shit, that's really good. - Yeah. - [Narrator] Well, there you have it. The toilet helps Shannon secure the victory. Making next year will be weirder? Thanks for tuning in. - People used to read news on the toilet, now the toilet can read news to you. (Dieter groaning) (Shannon laughing)",

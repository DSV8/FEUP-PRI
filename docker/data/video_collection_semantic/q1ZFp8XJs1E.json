    "transcript": "a while ago I got an email from a Best Buy employee saying they really wanted to see me make fun of this system. which is an offer I can't really refuse, so I went onto the marketplace bought it and uh yeah here it is let's check it out but first today's video is sponsored by Deep Cool and sales that they're having on some of their badass coolers if you've been in the market for a deep cool AK 620 the cooler that I use in my winter PC or you're more of an aiio person and have been looking at the Deep cool LT 720 now now is a great time to get them cuz their prices are splunking down to record depths get the AK 620 from Thursday for $51 or LT 720 for $110 using the link in the video description thank you deep cool for sponsoring today's video this is actually a very interesting system it may just be a dow office PC but it's not just some Opti this was a full-blown workstation that's been gamified and I've never looked at one of these before so I'm really excited to check it out the first hint that we're not just working with a Facebook machine here is they've really leaned into the pretend ventilation on the front and the reason I I pretend is that there may be a lot of it but it's still more dense than a Rosa Luxembourg book ain't nothing getting through there other than that we've got a bunch of IO on the front on the side it's got some Battle Scars I don't think that has anything to do with it being a workstation I just thought I'd point it out also they covered the whole system in this tape which I don't entirely understand why cuz the tape is basically the same color is the PC underneath it's all over the place it's even on the top here and on the back we've got a whole whole lot more IO and we even have the option to plug three monitors into the system without a dedicated graphics card which if that isn't Pro I don't know what is oh and we also get an ooh port for some reason but putting the workstation of it aside the seller did gamify it for us so let's open it up and see how they did that aside from the black tape all over it not a whole lot apparently they did drop a GTX 1650 in here which which is fine we should be able to get some 1080p gaming performance out of this system and they had the decency to stuff it to the brim with ram we have 32 gigs of ddr4 in here but other than maybe an SSD the rest of the interior looks pretty standard Dell I love how even with these workstation systems they think this isn't an abomination of a cooler to drum in here but it's not all bad on the bright side we do have a standard matx mother motherboard in here and what looks like a standard ATX power supply so later in the video we may be able to upgrade the crap out of this system but before then let's see what kind of gaming performance we get for about 550 Canadian drai now one of the benefits of this kind of marketplace system is that it usually just has a plain Windows 10 install on it which means no VD maffy doesn't value the seller enough to give them blood money to put their software on the system which is great in terms of specs aside from the 1650 and the 32 gigs of RAM that we've already looked at the system also has one of the newer Intel quadcore Dark Ages CPUs in it it's got a 60700 in it which should be a decent pairing for the 1650 we have in here wo look at that we've basically got a perfectly balanced system at least at 1080p medium settings in Battlefield 5 and it it it does kind of fluctuate based on what's going on but with these settings this is a very playable result we've got mid 80 frames per second happening and look at our frame time graph it's so smooth you can lick syrup off it very nice it genuinely feels remarkably smooth on this monitor let's try a couple other games cyberpunk at 1080p low settings is also very playable we're getting well over 40 frames per second here I did try briefly 1080p medium and it wasn't going great uh with the built-in Benchmark it was quite stuttery like the frame time graph was all over the place but here in the game with low settings which still look good we're getting a relatively smooth experience aside from that the temperatures and noise are very good on that system that stupid little cooler is handling the crap out of the 30 Watts it has to deal with very impressive when it comes to essentially what this system was designed to do which is play fortnite at 1080p competitive settings it does it really well this is a smooth confident experience aside from the occasional big stutter which as far as I understand it is server related so it's not really the system's fault yeah I'd say if you were a kiddo you'd be real happy with What's Happening Here wa at Native 1080p low settings the system Crusher 9000 is running better than I was expecting it doesn't look great but this is very much a usable experience and then we have the option of uh using FSR which I find really funny that we have to use amd's technology to help out in video graphics cards so we can use FSR to drop the render scale to 720p I think the main difference that makes aside from a little bit more frame rate is the reduction in latency like you can you can feel yeah it feels way more playable but with that let's do some upgrade poos now when it comes to upgrading this system I have a couple of options the first is to just drop a faster graphics card in here and take our chances with it developing an abusive relationship with the CPU bottleneck which I did I dropped an RTX 350 in here and with a game like Battlefield 5 I got more performance than I was expecting but it's still not great luckily there are nonproprietary Parts in this system which means it should be relatively straightforward for me to upgrade the rest of it although this kind of thing has this way of blindsiding you with random proprietary connectors halfway through the upgrade process but I guess we'll just deal with that when it happens yeah you see there's our problem this is the power button cable which is is very much not a standard connector which means it's going to be pretty annoying to start this system up but you know it comes to the territory I guess I am also going to have to replace the power supply which isn't a huge loss cuz it is just a scrawny 290 W little baby but we're having to replace it because it doesn't have standard connectors on it so we're not going to be able to power the other motherboard with it luckily the power supply itself is a standard shape so we can easily swap it out I also love how there are solder points on the motherboard for a standard ATM connector but they were just like no you know what no Let's do let's do that instead wow this has a real found in a shenzen bin vibe to it quality hey some real lowest bitter power delivery going on there now I've decided to be a little bit more modest about the upgrade it's not like you're going to be dropping a 4090 into that stupid case even this feels a bit like dropping nice freshly harvested organs into a whale carcass you found on the beach anyway we've got our 13400 16 gigs of RGB Ram just to get a bit of bling going and our low profile RTX 4060 that I've been using a lot lately and then finally the motherboard is going to be this lowly Prime h610 M because it's one of the only ATX motherboards I just have lying around at the office at the moment oh I'm even going to use the little stock Intel cooler now we have sacrificed a ram quantity but this is faster Ram which may help our 13400 get some slightly higher frame rates in Battlefield 5 it's not clicking into place but that's fine we'll just screw it down that is wow that is quite the move uh they decided to use this standard USB 3 front header uh connector but then add this little clip in thing so that you can't use it with another motherboard very good can't believe I expected anything else oh yeah wait I forgot we got to be real animals about this and after enabling some XMS in the Bios we were ready to try some gaming on our new and improved system with Battlefield 5 at the same 1080p medium settings as before we've got a healthy Step Up in performance with over 200 frames per second it's feeling really smooth this is a nice gaming experience although that little stock Intel cooler is struggling its heart out it's way noisier than the previous configuration was now putting that aside you don't just upgrade so you can run at the same settings so let's jump it up to ultra settings at 1080p yeah we're still getting a very good result it feels really smooth like buttery smooth W that is a big difference so we've got well over 120 frames per second at low settings 1080p which I guess that means we've got to crank it up to at least High ah there we go so even at high settings we're getting almost 100 frames per second with cyber Punk and because we've got some RTX action in here uh we don't need to use amd's charity to get extra frame rates dlss quality on with just a little bit a dab of Ray tracing and this way we're getting 60 frames per second with our Rays being traced at 1080p very good nice that is a lot of frame rates happening in fortnite these are the same 1080p competitive settings that I was using before except we're getting way higher frame rates uh which gives us some really startling stutters that's those are those are some pretty serious stutters oh damn 100 frames per second in The Last of Us that's pretty crazy uh this is 1080p low though so I I I guess it's not that impressive let's see what happens when we change it to high so we're getting over 60 frames per second at 1080p High settings with the last of us and now it looks all cinematic and beautiful and the game feels good yeah I mean it's it's honestly running very well uh although in all fairness the last device isn't as demanding now as it was when it first came out they did optimize it quite a lot through patching but still that's cool so what did we learn in today's video well if you take all of the hardware out of your case and replace it with better Hardware it'll run faster and in this case you get the added benefit of having no working front IO but at least no one will steal it which is nice and brings me to the end of the video thank you for watching if you enjoyed it like And subscribe to the channel for more videos like this one and until the next one bye-bye",

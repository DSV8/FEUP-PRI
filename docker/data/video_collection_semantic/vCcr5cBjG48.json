    "transcript": "this is a PCI built for less than 400 using Amazon and in today's video we're gonna upgrade it into a shiny Bastion of gaming Excellence using only Amazon's Choice crap which should go interestingly but before we get into that today's video is sponsored by the fascinating Corsair shift series of power supply if you ever thought normal power supplies are stupid and have their modular connectors in the wrong place Corsair has you covered by moving the connectors to the side of the power supply a simple but ingenious way to more evenly use your power supply basement freeing up your stuffing holes so if this sounds good to you check out the Corsair shift series of power supplies using the link in the description below thank you Corsair for sponsoring today's video thank you now the upgrade part selection process was pretty straightforward I would just Amazon Google the category of thing I wanted to upgrade and then just blindly pick the Amazon's Choice option which I'm not gonna lie felt borderline orwellian so with that let's see what upgrades are corporate overlords thought fit for me I'm going to start off with this package for no particular reason upgrade number one is fans obviously we needed RGB and Amazon and all of its wisdom chose this set which is The Cooler Master fan mf-120 Halo set as far as I understand not only do you get three RGB fans for about 62 Canadian dollars but it also comes with a wired RGB Hub very nice I guess we'll we'll see how they work out this turbo paste actually wasn't in Amazon's Choice thing I just bought it for my own personal use so ignore that upgrade number two is some sleeved extension cables to get rid of the ketchup and mustard of the power supply that we have in there this one was a bit harder to choose because there wasn't an Amazon's Choice sleeved extension cable set but this one was one of the highly recommended ones by Amazon so I guess that counts so much of Amazon recommended goodies upgrade number three I think we are at this point is this syy thermal paste that's packaged a little bit like a fancy condom brand that's marketed at Finance Bros upgrade number seven is some more storage and Amazon's choice is this crucial P3 one terabyte drive and it's a nice and fast nvme Drive now obviously considering that we wanted to upgrade this system to a true gamer system we needed some RGB and Amazon's Choice RGB strip is this air goo digital RGB LED strip kit which apparently has super bright LEDs what more could you want and it should work with all of the other RGB that we have because it's just the standard RGB connector upgrade number 17 is a new CPU Cooler and Amazon's choice is this beefy looking thermal right Peerless assassin 120se a big ass cooler that should cool the crap out of the 4600g that we have in that system and then the final most important upgrade upgrade number 17 is the graphics card and Amazon's choice is this MSI Ventus 2 RTX 3060. a graphics card that cost more than the entire system that we're dropping it into cost so um yeah this is a bit of a bit of an Overkill upgrade I think and I don't think the CPU is going to pair particularly well with it at 1080p but again we'll see how all of that goes a final note on the upgrade selection I did also want to upgrade the power supply to something a little bit less IED than we had unfortunately that power supply is the Amazon's Choice power supply so I guess I'm stuck with the PSU equivalent of white phosphorus thanks Jeff and with that outrage let's get to our Amazon's Choice upgrade as a point of reference let's have a bit of an oogle at the starting point so we can more fully appreciate the end result um so I think I'm going to start off by dropping these sleeved cable extensions in this and it's um apparently the bag that holds them in has been chewed by a small dog okay so we got some cable Combs that's nice two eight pin pcie cables and as you can see they're this kind of like carbon and black color uh it looks pretty good you also get a CPU power and 20 full pin extension cable but why are they sticky aside from my own stupidity oh I missed one like right at the beginning uh the cable comps were real easy to add aided in part by the borderline suspicious malleability of the cables I think I'm gonna remove this bottom hard drive cage just to make a bit more room for cable management we have a reasonable amount but it's just gonna make things a bit easier now that we have this extra length of extension that we're gonna have to fit in there so now this can kind of go pretty deep into that hole and then we attach this there we go that looks pretty good I'd say although zip tying now is actually a pretty terrible idea because I have so much RGB cable management and stuff that I'm gonna have to do later but you know whatever I'm sure it won't come back and bite me and just like that we have four times the storage that's also much faster which I think means next we should add the RGB fans there's going to be two in the front and then we're also going to replace this rear exhaust fan with an RGB fan which I am very excited about considering that it's a Molex Abomination and with that I've immediately run into a problem with my overzealous zip tying I accidentally zip tied down the fan cable for the fan that we're about to replace so I'm already gonna have to cut this one I'm sure it won't come back and bite me I think you just oh that was easy you get like a bunch of mounting hardware with it oh this is like a three-way fan splitter so that you can play plug all three of the RGB fans into one header and then finally we have our internal RGB cable so we can control all of the RGB with software now on the actual Hub we have three RGB headers uh which means I don't think we're gonna also be able to plug our RGB strip into this little box but this little box uses USB so it means we are going to have a free RGB header on the motherboard so that's good hopefully this isn't going to be a complete nightmare in the way that RGB often is and then this is our fan yeah it's reasonably solid it's not like they're going to do anything in the front anyway considering considering the front ventilation on this case Okay so I've noticed an immediate problem with this case we don't have cable routing holes for fans to go in here so the cable routing may be a bit dodgy first things first you gotta break the Fan's screw virginity before trying to mount them it just makes it way easier this is what pre and post guide Hall savaging looks like as soon as I finished my guide hole drilling I found the fan cable routing holes the cable routing holes are over here but that doesn't make any sense because I don't think there's enough space for the fans yeah that doesn't work that's stupid that is a hilariously unhelpful feature but luckily the weird shape of the fans came to the rescue giving me space throughout the cables other than that mounting the fans was very straightforward oh we get two RGB strips you spoil us Ergo Ergo supplements the relatively weak magnets with a bit of sticky stuff on the back making mounting very easy although hiding the little daisy chain tail bits on the RGB strips required some creative crevice stuffing with our RGB fans and two RGB strips this thing is going to light up like a hemroid on taco night but we need to finish upgrading it first whoa that is a big cooler I'm not even sure it's gonna fit in the case and obviously in terms of thermal paste we have to use our Amazon's Choice condom paste there it is our silicon thermal paste now part of me Connor wants to just put one fan in the middle and then call it a day because the CPU that we're using does not need this much cooling it was running very cool and quiet with the stock coolers this is obscene Overkill and the thing is we have a little bit of a ram clearance issue for the fan here now I could add the second fan on this side but then it's going to cover up some of our RGB so I don't know I think we kind of just need to add the one in the middle no I'm not gonna lie this Ventus 2 is a pretty losery version of the RTX 3060 uh but it should get the job done you know I I think it is it's okay with that the transformation was complete hey I'd say that's a very nicely pmped system I particularly like this very functional GPU anti-sag device it's really putting in some work here isn't it and we haven't even turned it on yet so let's drop the side panel on there and turn it on to see the light show that's quite the Improvement making the internals of the starter system look like an unfurnished apartment but what about performance obviously we're doing a lot better than we were when we just had the igpu in here but that's compared to no dedicated gpus so this performance bump is about as surprising as the sun rising in the morning but that doesn't diminish the Colossal size of the jump considering we also crank the settings from low to high at 1080p but it does seem like we have a little bit of a CPU bottleneck utilization jumps to about 90 percent every now and then but yeah the 4600g is kind of struggling to keep up with the RTX 3060 but I think considering the huge amount of CPU temperature Headroom we have let's do a small overclock on this CPU and see how much of a difference that makes to the the gaming performance in terms of overclocking I went full newbie with it and just bumped the core frequency until the system wouldn't boot 4.6 was as far as I could get the fan on the thermal ride cooler does not sound great it sounds like it's having a bit of a rough time but yeah so this is with the overclock the main difference is seems to be the temperatures like you can see we've got higher power draw and more than 10 degrees Celsius higher CPU temperatures in terms of performance though I am not too sure it feels very similar feelings that were corroborated by a standardized test we barely gained any average frame rate but we got a good jump in one percent lows but I don't think the performance is entirely the cpu's fault because in the previous video I dropped an RX 6600 into the system without a CPU overclock and got a better result so uh yeah there's that at the end of the day Jeff's pick was okay aside from the abomination of the power supply also I probably wouldn't buy that exact version of the RTX 3060 in fact considering the rest of the system I'd be more inclined to just buy an RX 6600 for much less money or a used graphics card come to think of it also the thermal ride assassin does not come with very good fans and the RGB strips had this very cute habit of just switching off every now and then oh I also compared the thermal paste to knock to a nth2 which performed very similarly so that's pretty good but yeah with that let me know what you thought of the upgrade and consider watching the video where I actually built this system and until the next video foreign",

    "transcript": "- We have new Xbox hardware. So I'm here at the Xbox Showcase taking a look at the brand-new lineup of the Xbox Series S and Series X. Now, it is not a tremendous overhaul because the biggest upgrade here is absolutely the fact that we now have a all-digital Xbox Series X. Now, the rumors going into this is that we would have a full redesign. You know, that round-looking console that was in the leaks a year or two ago, that is not what we see. Instead, they have taken the standard Xbox Series X, they have turned it white, and they've removed the disk drive. Very similar, in fact, to when they brought out the Xbox One S all-digital a few years ago. If you remember that, they pretty much just took the disk drive out of the Series S and called it a day. Well, that's likely what's going on here. Now, I do have a theory about what's on the inside. There are... Now, these are dummy units, so I can look in all I want. There's really nothing inside, so I can't learn anything at the moment. But my suspicion is that we're actually going to see some internal upgrades. They're not talking about it at the moment, but I would be surprised if we don't see a six-nanometer chip inside, similar to what we've had on the PS5 for a little while, and likely a shrunken cooling solution and whatnot. I mean, there's a lot of extra space is now going to be available in this Series X, so time will tell, but I'm very curious to see what that's all about. Now, the price is a little bit interesting. The Xbox Series X is staying at $500 for the one-terabyte model, as well as there's a new two-terabyte model, which we'll talk about in a second. But there are now five different tiers of Xbox. So let's break it down. Starting out with, on the base, we have the Xbox Series S. It is theoretically unchanged, although again, I'm curious to see if there are any internal upgrades because none of these consoles are shipping until later this year. So we got 512 gigabyte SSD in these standard Series S, $300. The next step up is the one-terabyte Xbox Series S. Now, I did a video on this last year, and I actually think that's lowkey a pretty cool console, but they're actually getting rid of the black version. Instead, it's going to be white. So the way to think about the Xbox lineup right now is that if it is a white console, it is diskless, and if it is a black console, it has a disk drive. At least from a visual perspective, that's the way you'll be able to kind of split them. So they're actually discontinuing the black version of the Series S. They're all going to be white. Now, stepping up from the $350 price point of this guy, you're at $450 for the digital Series X. That's an interesting price. It does pretty much exactly match what Sony are doing with the PS5 Slim. Sales, I'm sure, will be around to kind of bring it down a little bit. In fact, actually right now, as I'm recording this video, Sony have the PS5 Slim available for $50 off. It'll be interesting to see where this really lands. I think at $400, this is going to be a compelling value, but it gets a little crowded, right? Because you're talking about $300 for the Series S, or 350, or 450. And then if you come over to the Special Edition, this goes all the way up to 600 bucks. So there's a wide delta in prices between the cheapest Xbox Series S and the most expensive. So the Xbox Series X, $450. They will still be also keeping the standard one-terabyte model around. So you'll still be able to get the exact same Series X with some theoretical upgrades on the inside at $500. And then if you wanna go all the way up to the Special Edition, this is going to be coming with a two-terabyte hard drive, SSD, and it also has this limited-edition colorway. Now, this is a little bit of an interesting-looking device. I'm not totally sold on the speckle finish. I mean, I think it looked good from some angles, but also it does look, I know some people were kind of saying it looks like overspray or something. It's a unique look. The controller also matches, but in a more subtle way. I do like the fact that it's sort of green on the bottom. It does give me some vibes of like that old-school Xbox experience. And if you really want a two-terabyte SSD, I mean, there's no reason not to. This is a minor refresh. Now, if the expectations I have is that the insides of these Xboxes have been updated with potentially new chips, some minor stuff. Again, they're not talking about that. There may be literally nothing on the inside that's new. But, my suspicion is we are far enough into the console generation that there's probably some things they could have cut down here and still give us some similar performance, very much like what Sony have done with the PS5 since the beginning with several iterations. But, it's interesting to think about what the Xbox team have done with this update because it seems pretty clear that while we're only a few months away from the PS5 Pro, and that's gonna be getting a ton of shine when it comes to the extra performance and whatnot, the Microsoft Xbox team feel pretty confident in what they've got here. Now, they did mention on stage that they are well underway on work for the next generation of consoles, and I assume that maybe next year, we'll start to hear some of that. But for now, the Xbox lineup is pretty standard. Series S sticks around almost entirely unchanged. The Series X is now available in an all-digital configuration for $450. And if you wanna go all the way up to two terabytes, they do have the Special Edition. It's nice to see them sticking around with both disk and diskless. Really, the only thing we're missing on this lineup is a disk drive in the Series S, but I don't think that's coming anytime soon. I'm very curious. What do you think about the updates to the Xbox lineup? I'm incredibly excited to crack open the all-digital version because my expectation is we might be seeing a little bit more than meets the eye.",

    "transcript": "When I was a young boy My father took me Into the Hot Topic To get some skinny jeans - Hello and welcome to This Is. Today we are gonna look at the best place to get tech from \"Hot Topic.\" In our ongoing series to find tech in the weirdest places. We went to our local mall, we burused the racks of - Bruised? - Okay, okay, you know what? That's the energy I'm gonna have today. - I was gonna give you these, but I'm gonna get it for someone else. I probably should have been more gentle with those. - Blood vile for your besties, ew! - Remember when you were sitting down and I poked the back of your neck with something? Well, I had a pair of vials made up. You and me can both be wearing each other's blood. Here you go. Here we go. Oh, there we go, champ. Now you have roughly one CC of my blood which is mostly Dr. Pepper. And then I have some of yours which I will use to clone you and create a super Austin with mass military destructive potential. We saw this and we're like, we got a hot topic though. - Y'all are real excited, I'm gonna be the grumpiest of grumps. Go ahead. Hit me with this tech. It's PS5, you did not buy that from \"Hot Topic-\" - Or did we? - You did not buy a PS5 for \"Hot Topic.\" - We didn't. - Okay, good. - Instead we got. - The PlayStation five Pro Kit? - Pro Kit. - These are the essential accessories made to improve my next genin gaming experience. I've gotten myself a dual port compact charger, a detachable mobile phone holder, a powerful 50 millimeter RGB set of headphones, and most importantly a 10 foot USB C cable, and a 10 foot USB range extending cable. All right, let's see what we got here. - Oh, automatically hate this. - So, we're gonna start out with the headphones and their, is this just, okay, that's lot of cables. On the surface it looks quite PS fivey, so, we've got the white as well as the black and the blue which are all my favorite colors. - This is literally just an extension cable. Oh, oh! - Oh, wow! That was a loud crash. This is a user's guide, it says use it and that's, all right, that's it. Can you hear that? It's not super sturdy, but it's also not, not sturdy. So like- - Oh, okay. So, it's regular. Look at the microphone, it's just a hole in the side. There's no actually like, boom, it's just literally a thing that says microphone, look, you see? - Boom. - Wait, how are we gonna demo this? - We de, oh, we weren't, we haven't demoed these in like four episodes. - Ow! Wow! It's like you hear it like echo, you hear it? How much was this beautiful accessory kit for the PlayStation cinco? - [Kenzie] $70. - And it came with the PS5? - It did not come with the PS5. - Came with the controller though? - It did not come with the controller. - Came with a phone to put in the controller though? - It did not come with a phone. - It came with a $50 \"Hot Topic\" gift card. - I wish. - Aaron, can you please prepare your, just crack your knuckles, get ready for some crash noises, okay, ready? (loud thud) Matt, just do the honors. - Fine, I understand what you had issues with that, all right? It's because you're not a PlayStation boy, instead, I got you these. - Joy-cons, woo! - I know that the joy-cons just aren't your, really your speed. - I thought you just said they were, but I mean, yes. I don't like Joy-cons. Thumbies, we got some thumbies. So these are thumb grips from the Whatever Company. You've got to pay for this one 'cause there's an anti-theft tag inside. So, stop stealing. - Well. - Can I ask, has anyone ever had peach milk? 'Cause the theme is peach milk. So we have four thumb grips for switch and switch lite. They do look quite rubbery, ooh! Hold your hand out Matt, hold your hand out, I'm gonna peach milk. - Oh, I've been milked. - [Austin] All we have here are four title thumb grips which are relatively high quality. I mean, they're cute, they're really not gonna do a whole lot. How much were this? - [Kenzie] $10 and 32 cents. - [Austin] I've never wanted to leave a video more in my life. (Kenzie laughs) Mountain Dew Baja Blast socks! Is this an opportunity for me to whip my feet out and put on some sweet Baja blast gear? - I figured we could use the foot. - Nope, so, doesn't smell like Baja blast, that's fine. - Did you think they dyed them green by just soaking them in Baja Blast? - Yeah, how else would they do it? - That's fair. - I could tell you that these were $6 and 90 cents. - No! - [Kenzie] No, they weren't. We got 'em for 5.50. - [Austin] Woo-hoo! - [Matt] We pretty much got everything here on sale. Oh God, oh God. (Austin struggling) - Here, you got a little, little- - No- - There you go. He's just got a little tiny little feeters. - I'm putting both my feet up on the table, Aaron arbitrize. - We've done some things on this channel, but never before have we given away Wikifeet content for free. So if you like this, subscribe for more. Oh, God! Why are your feet so tiny? - You know, I'm doing rest of the video like this, right? Oh! Yo! This is a Taco Bell fire hat, so I'm just gonna... - God, I wanna punch you so much. - It's okay, here, I'm showing a little too much skin. I'm just gonna just pull it down, just a little- - Your capris? - Yeah, there we go. If you want the height of fashion, how much is this figure cost me? - [Kenzie] The hat, $20. - I don't remember the hat being that expensive. - Style is expensive, Matt. You don't just wake up looking like this in the morning. Present me some more \"Hot Topic\" tech. Boy, this is the most comfortable I've ever been on a \"This is\" video. - All right, so you look like you're ready for a fashion shoot. Sometimes you just don't want people to accidentally leak your footage here, so I got you this. - My foot-age? Milk tech cam cover? We got you covered, cover your camera to prevent camera access when you don't want it. These are dumb 'cause they'll break your screens, but, okay. It's the Kawaii camera cover. - [Matt] If you go to mattttstore.com, you can get a Kawaii Matt T-shirt with my face on it. - So it just covers over, it's just a little like rubber guy. What I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna complete the fit. (Kenzie laughs) - When people go to \"Hot Topic,\" I see people coming out that look like you right now. - When you make me do a hot topic video, Matt, this is the energy you get. So if you don't like it, sorry to say this is what you got. - I promise we did get some tech. - Bring it on. - All right. (Austin scoffs) - The Big Chungus new wave from NoHo, California. No one calls it NoHo. That's just another box inside it, I got excited and it's just, it's another box. (lo-fi music) - What? What are you? - I'm taking this video as seriously as you take my content, Matt. - No see what he, I like how he was like, \"Fine, I'll sit normal.\" When really he's just realizing, oh this is super uncomfortable. - Let's see what our wireless stereo is like. Okay. (Matt laughs) Is this wait, wait, wait, okay, there's a huge chain here that's a little boom box. Let's (beep) go! - So, we'll get rid of this guy. - All right, I'mma pair this bad boy. Let's get on the chain. It's gonna be off the chain. (playful music) - This ain't bad. (playful music) People use to respect me. - No, we didn't. I'm actually semi-impressed by that. - [Austin] It sounds actually reasonable. It's heavy enough that you don't forget that it's there. And honestly it looks like legit, like even like some of the buttons, like the little tuple guy actually works as the volume. How much was this? 'Cause it was worth it. - [Kenzie] $61. - It's fashionable. - Honestly- - I'm okay with this one. - A little expensive, but the quality is here. All right Matt, how can you top this? The hotline 16,000 power bank in pink. - We used to be a channel that did informational content. I just wanted, just to remind you, \"This Is\" used to give you interesting trivia and facts and now we have clearly moved to the correct side of YouTube. See when you say \"Hot Topic\" tech, oh, good lord! When you say \"Hot Topic\" tech, this is the kind of thing I expect. That's a big, that's a big, big boy. Big boy - Wait, it actually have buttons? - Hell yeah it does. - [Matt] Okay. - I mean, I don't think they do anything. - That's way more than I thought it was going to- - Slidey button, slidey boys, let's see. - Ooh, it's flashlight. - Ah! Bright. It's- - That's so bright. Wow! Ah! It has a 10 watt qi wireless charger on the back, 16,000 million a hours apparently. It has USB C output and USB, micro USB input, and that seems a strange selection of ports. The buttons are neat. I mean it feels a little like weirdly weighted, I will say. 'Cause definitely it's all like on one side and the rest of it is kind of hollow- - Sure. - [Austin] This was 60 bucks. - [Kenzie] No, 31. - Did Matt get some good stuff here? He sure did. - Pretty Solid. - All right, you got your Walkman, you got your boom box, but what about, how are you gonna charge all these? 'Cause- - No idea. - You have all the charges, but we wanted something that capture the essence of \"Hot Topic\" and you know, being in the mall, where do you go after \"Hot Topic?\" - Auntie Anne's. - Yeah, and where's that located? - On the corner. - In the food court. - That too. - And what else is in the food court? - Restaurants? I don't know. - So this may or may not be something that you already own. - Okay. (upbeat music) - We've got ourselves a figure-8 cable. - Very chunky figure-8 cable. - And oh my good lord! This is like a wood panel change machine. - In the arcade, which is located in the food court which is next to the \"Hot Topic.\" No, the food court and the arcade are on different sides of the mall, and \"Hot Topic\" is upstairs to the left. So I've got myself almost nothing that actually functions here. There's literally a little slidey guy, but the real star is a wide plethora of USB A ports. - Anything left? (lo-fi music) They show- - Oh, there's little coins and stickers. - Yeah! - These are some of these smallest coins I have ever seen. That bag will be useful for later. We've also got some stickers. Let's put some stickers on it. Temporarily out of service LED indicator with an on and off button. So the only thing it does when it plugs it in, is it shows out of service. Wow! That's really thematic irrelevant. - This is cute. - It is, I mean, dumb but cute. So, there's look the little tiny temporarily out of service LED. - Careful, you don't lose the coins. And they're all gone. - Plug our power bank in. - [Matt] Baam! - Okay. - All right. - This next item is, it is not really tech, I just really wanted it for myself. - Ah, Fuecoco! - It's just, he's just a little guy. Look, look at him. Look at this a little fleet. Look at him, he don't even stand up. All right. - He's so dense. - Oh, what's that? (indistinct) Oh, he said some really not good things. So what happens after you just had a play at your high school and you and all your theater troops, you're about to go to Denny's, you wanna bring some games to Denny's, all right? Well, you could still be on brand of being dark and brooding at the Denny's with- - Operation? (box thuds) Hey Matt, I don't do the thing. Oh, there. - Hello Bone Daddy. - You're just gonna drop something in. - What? All right, so- - I'm just gonna just. (upbeat music) - Okay, you're pretty good at that- - Go ahead. - Well, so, I have to go for the split a seam. (Matt screaming) - I'm literally getting them all, it's so easy. So easy, a toddler could do it. - What's that say about you? I'm like at least four years old. - So, this is all the tech that \"Hot Topic\" had to offer us. Most of it was more just Plushies and Funko pops. There were some gems in there. Like. (indistinct) - I'd like to thank you for watching and deciding to subscribe and ring-a-ling the ding-a-ling button for Austin, Matt, Kenzie, and Aaron's happy-go-lucky, funtime Adventure, also known as this was a great video. I'm not, okay I'm not, okay",

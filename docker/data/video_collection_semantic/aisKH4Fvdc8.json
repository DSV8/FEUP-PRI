    "description": "A lot of the news focus is on Zen 2 and the upcoming Ryzen 3000-series CPUs but we decided to move our primary editing workstations away from Intel and towards AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2.  What a change from our current choice of Intel!  That decision was prompted by a removal of Adobe Premier from our daily workflows.  With that in mind, let's take a look at this epic editing / gaming PC build and how it performs.  :)   Buy items in this video from Amazon at the links below:  Enermax White AIO:   AMD Thradripper 2950X:   ASUS Zenith Alpha:   G.Skill 128GB Memory Kit:   RoG Ryujin AIO:   RoG RTX 2080 Ti STRIX:   RoG Thor PSU:     Subscribe    Review units provided free of charge by AMD, ASUS and G.Skill.

    "transcript": "I really want this next build to be epic well then you really are going to have to hold my beer so this my friends is going to be the most powerful system probably I've ever built revolving around the ROG eco systems we have the motherboard the power supplied the cooler the graphics card the case some LED accessories and peripherals so full out ASUS ROG fanboying over here and at the core we have the threadRipper 2950X as 16 core 32 thread part whoo that should be fun the lick tech 2 360 air cooler from Animax now comes in this gorgeous white finish to give your PC a bit of character the EF one pump delivers superior cooling performance it's both Intel and AMD socket compatible and it features RGB lighting learn more about it down below well well look how tables have turned huh not long ago I made a video about ditching Ryzen going back to Intel and that solely was because of Intel Quick Sync support that was added into Adobe Premiere so you could utilize the Intel graphics cards on the CPU to accelerate your render times and that was like a 2x performance increase in Adobe Premiere which made total sense for me but my friends this is my first threadRipper system Eber has built a few and now I'm kind of happy to be back into the AMD world especially because they're gaining so much hype and I'm excited for the 3000 series and this would be a really good starting point to just see how their third or the 3000 series performs in comparison to this 2950x it should be fun now I want to be clear that while this system is insanely powerful for Adobe Premiere it is not my razor blade 15 renders video faster than this beast and that just shows you that Intel CPUs are still far ahead for Adobe applications but Premiere has not been really friendly to us and lots of crashes just all the updates break things you're not getting the things that we want to get for an annual subscription fee or monthly subscription fee which is why I'm moving into DaVinci Resolve 16 studio and that's been just such a pleasure to use such refreshing program that actually utilizes the hardware and you're not you know bald down to using Intel CPUs only and before we do the parts breakdown which are all listed in the description below by the way thank you very much let's do I'm not gonna lie to you guys this is the most expensive build I've ever done and just looking over the price list for each of those components it's just so intimidating like the motherboard the Asus Zenith Xtreme alpha it's over $600 it's ehx it is the heaviest motherboard I've ever held in my hands it's got all types of overclocking features it's built super well I won't be able to utilize it because it was built to support the 32 core thread referred to 2990WX but I have the 2950X in there I just enabled the precision boost overdrive tweak a few things here and there enable my RAM profile the XMP but for new AMD side and just be on my way now for memory juice kill hooked us up with 128 gigabyte kit this is my first so thank you very much it's got beautiful RGB ambient illumination that I can sync up to the entire system unfortunately the ryo gene 360 Miller all-in-one cooler do not allow the all dims to be populated because the actual base plate and the little plastic cover that goes over top of the pump it blocked the two closest slots which means that I was only able to populate 64 gigabytes in there but with a cooler swap that I'm expecting from Noctua for future use I will have 128 gigabytes in total a little bit later now for the graphics card we got the ROG Strix gaming rtx 2080 TI and that thing is absolutely insane it comes factory overclocked those triple fans and the massive heat sink and the RGB illumination everything is like a nice complete package I can overclock it to 2.1 gigahertz easy and the 2.1 gigahertz an RTX 2080 TI absolutely flies through anything now I initially mounted the GPU in the vertical orientation using the included case bracket but as I'm adding more GPUs down line to help with the rendering performance I did swap it out to have an this default horizontal orientation as for power we got the rog thor 1200 watt platinum efficiency power supply and that thing is insane it's got a screen on the side that shows you power consumption it has addressable RGB illumination that you can connect to the motherboard and have all that synced up very well it's got also braided cake that I found a really cool way to integrate around my little ROG character so they span and they kind of wrap around him and into the graphics card and I found that a really good integration to not only populate that sort of empty space in an otherwise really giant case but also really cool aesthetic that highlights the cables and secures the character in the case too and since we weren't so over killed the last piece of the puzzle was more lighting I installed the RG or a terminal beside the motherboard on that cable cover routed an additional addressable RGB strip on top to highlight the cooler and give the internal space a bit more ambient lighting now one unique element about this whole build are the three screens that are inside the one on the a a pump that you can customize to show your CPU voltage your temperature is your fan speeds whatever you want you can show different graphics as well there's the motherboard screen that shows you different codes different temperature you can also customize that and the power supply screen that shows you only the draw power the issue however is the lack of cohesion between all three screens in terms of font size in terms of animations in terms of link refresh rate even so that kind of sucks but that is a minor complaint on an otherwise beastly rig and performance wise I'm very happy with my DaVinci Resolve studio 16 public beta for performance wise the numbers really do speak for themselves this is the fastest machine I've ever built however it is not for premiere like I said earlier my razor blade exports videos faster because of Intel Quick Sync but it looks like I'm back on Ryzen and it wasn't that long ago when I was ditching rising going to Intel flip-flop flip-flop but the threadRipper system is an absolute beast I feel like it's still way too overkill for my needs even in video production yet it is faster for DaVinci Resolve than my 9900K machine and I'm moving away from Adobe applications because I feel like they're just slugging around their low back in my day this is how it used to be done the venture is all feels fresh it feels young optimization is there and that is what I want to support so what is the future of the system you may ask well I want to downsize the Arrowwood G Helius case for me is that a bit too large but I've done a fool of you you can check it out over here I want to swap out the cooler so that I can have space for 128 gigabytes of RAM in here and really want to explore overclocking maybe 4.2 maybe higher on 8 cores and beyond motherboard definitely allows it and the vrm cooling here is fantastic and I also want to bring this into a research center and see what the spreader per CPU can do in terms of compute and applications outside of the traditional video production and I'm not going to be gaming on this thing this is not our gaming machine despite it looking like this get a good sense of grip with Corsairs iron claw RGB Gaming Mouse featuring a lightweight design ultra durable Emraan switches paired with Pixar's 33 91 optical sensor and some RGB lining for some extra Flair the iron claw ensures gaming at its best check it out down below so big thanks to a soos for providing the parts this is not a sponsored video this is just us having fun and experimenting and me really wanting a threadripper system so that we can move on with our lives to explore other avenues in terms of hardware optimizations for particular applications in our video production now if you have any suggestions on how we can utilize the CPU properly for other interesting tasks let us know in the comments big thanks to Wendell from level one text for optimization troubleshooting Talk always appreciated and yeah I'll talk to you guys in the next video",

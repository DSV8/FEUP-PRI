    "transcript": "- [Michael] The Razer phone has been out for a while, and it's been reviewed to death, so what can I tell you about it that you don't already know? Well, how about we start with the thing that surprised me the most: it's not just for gaming, and you don't need to be a gamer to appreciate it. But, you do need to put up with a lot of stuff you probably won't want to. I'm Mr. Mobile, and this is the Razer phone review, brought to you by Gamestash. (mellow techno music) My absolute favorite thing about theRazer phone is that it stands out. It's broad, sharp, and wide, and the only color it comes in is matte black accented with Razer's big triple snake insignia. In a world where edge-to-edge screens are taking over, it brings big ol' bezels top and bottom. But, it makes use of that space with insanely loud, very high quality speakers that project their sound right out at your face. That's a carry-over from it's predecessor, the Nexbit Robin, as is the industrial design, this time done up in aluminum, with a soft paint-job that's probably a little scratch prone, but still feels great to hold. I've taken to calling it the obsidian obelisk., not just because I'm a dork, but because it kind of sounds like the title of an epic game you might find on this thing. No, just me, okay. Hey, remember when I reviewed the Pixel 2, and said there's only one phone that feels as fast and responsive? That's this, and it's mostly because of this: the display is a sharp IGZO LCD that out of the box is set at 90 hertz. That means it refreshes it's image 90 times a second, half, again, as fast as most other phone displays. And in the settings, you can crank it all the way up to 120 hertz, a refresh rapidity that once you use it will spoil you forever on slower screens. This is a liquid slickness like none other, and it's helped along by a potent set of specifications and the prime version of Nova Launcher, which is the custom launcher I use on most of my phones. Includiong that out of the box, instead of trying to cook up a convoluted new Android UI was an inspired move by Razer, as was throwing in the ability to personalize it using themes derived from games. But for all it's smoothness, the display is lacking in saturation, and while the 16 by 9 aspect is good for games and video, I still prefer an 18 by 9 phone for one-handed typing. Much more importantly, even the best screen is only good when you can see it, and this is the dimmest display I've used in years, with poor off-axis accuracy and a highly reflective display cover. Yes, I spent most of my time with the Razer phone in sunny Maui, but back in Boston, overcast days gave me almost as much trouble. Heck, even well-lit rooms indoors will have you reaching for the brightness slider. And more often than not, you'll be dismayed to see that it's already maxed out. Maybe it's a combination of that eternal backlight blasting and the refresh rate that runs this battery down more quickly than I'd expect. Four hours of screen-on time over eight hours of use isn't great when you consider the massive battery. I have been riding this phone pretty hard, compared to other phones. On the two-leg trip to Hawaii, I had about 11 hours to kill, and the Razer's gaming focus inspired me to game a lot. The optimized titles, those ones that can run at 120 hertz, look excellent, of course, but I had a lot more fun just shopping for whatever was new or popular in the Playstore. The lower frame rate of the non-optimized games is definitely noticeable, but, they run well. You can also use the game booster to tell the phone whether you care more about endurance or performance during gameplay, or you can apply those settings directly to individual apps. Now, a phone this big should definately have a headphone jack, especially given the target audience. But, at least there's a THX certified dongle in the box with a 24-bit DAC, if you do need to plug in. Along with the Dolby Atmos control panel for sound profiles. Where the phone really falls down for me is right here. Don't let the pronounced enclosure fool you; this dual camera system is a letdown in almost every way. Colors are muted, and focus is soft, so everything looks kind of lifeless. Turning on HDR does help, but it slows down the camera app so much you probably won't wanna use it. Now, early in my testing I got a suggestion from a Twitter follower: install the google camera app, since the Razer phone is made specifically for users who aren't afraid to side-load the occasional APK. And, it's good advice. When it works, it cleans up the color, and helps with dynamic range, and reduces noise, the kind of thing we've seen on other phones. But other times, the Google camera will actually do a worse job than Razer's app. I don't know if it's the phones hardware, or the implementation here, or what. Maybe if you've never compared photos or video with another phone you could learn to be okay with this camera. It would be fine. But, put it up against the images from the Pixel 2, and it's just, well, see for yourself. Putting any camera up against the Pixel 2's is bound to be a bloodbath; almost nothing can compete. But, I think it's instructive, as a reminder that cameras are hard, and side-loading an app is not a replacement for a really well-implemented camera system. And while were talking fundamentals, I should also mention that I had problems with voice calls on T-Mobile. They didn't always connect, and when they did connect, I sometimes had strange audio issues. Razer was good enough to send me a replacement device to see if I could reproduce the problem, and, I could. So, it's kind of a mystery. In the end, this is a phone designed for a very specific audience. Gamers, yes, but even more specifically, Razer brand loyalists. The kind of people who wanna phone companion to their Razer Blade Stealth and gaming mouse. The kind of people who might be willing to sacrifice some core features, like water-proofing, for some exotic ones. And you know what, I get that. I've bought a lot of stuff because of my affinity for a franchise, and I don't always put quality first. And people who do buy the Razer phone will be getting a lot of machine for their $700, not to mention, a pretty rare, eye-catching device. But if you're not a Razer super-fan, or a hardcore contrarian, you can get a much more well-rounded device for the same, or less. Speaking of games, this video was brought to you by Gamestash, a revolution in Android mobile games. Under $5 a month gets you chart-topping titles like Badlands, Worms, Cut the Rope, and over 300 more specially modified to cut out in-app purchases and adds. Try it free for 14 days, at the links in the description below. One last morcel for the folks who watch to the end, I'm in Hawaii because I'm covering the Qualcomm Snapdragon Tech Summit, so that's why the YouTube channel has been a little thin this week. I've been busy on Instagram and Twitter, though, where I even had a pretty cool interview with the Snapdragon boss himself. To see that, follow me on Instagram and Twitter @TheMrMobile. Until next time, thanks for watching, and stay mobile, my friends.",

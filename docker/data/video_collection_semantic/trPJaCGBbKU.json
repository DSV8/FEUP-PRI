    "transcript": "- [Occupy The Web] Go and grab, you know, one or two, or listen to them, get started. There's hundreds, hundreds of hacking books, and most of 'em are bad. - You and I have spent a lot of money buying a lot of books, and I'm really glad that you said in the beginning good and bad books so that people watching don't have to go and buy all the books, but just buy the books that you think are good. (upbeat music) Everyone, David Bombal back with Occupy The Web. If you haven't seen our previous videos, he's the author of this book, \"Linux Basics for Hackers\", a fantastic book if you wanna learn about Linux from a hackers point of view, great book. He's also the author of this book. Welcome and tell us you have or you are writing more books. Is that right? - [Occupy The Web] That is correct. Thank you for having me back, David, I've always enjoyed being on your YouTube channel. I am writing more books. Hopefully my \"Network Basics for Hackers\" is out by the end of the year. That's gonna be an interesting book for those of you who read my other books, in that it's gonna be exposition of many of the different network protocols and how they can be broken. Well, including automobile hacking, automobile networks, and automobile hacking, and radio frequency hacking and mobile hacking. So, we're gonna start off with TCP/IP of course, and all those protocols. And then we're gonna advance and at the end of the book into these more esoteric, maybe esoteric. - I like that. - [Occupy The Web] And we also gonna have some real heavy coverage of wifi cracking. So we're gonna go really deep into wifi, and I know everybody's favorite subject is wifi and wifi cracking. So, it's probably gonna be, you know, one of the most in depth chapters in the book with a lot of examples of how to crack wifi, so, and how wifi actually works. So, look for that book, hopefully it'll be up on Amazon by the end of the year. And then I have another one coming out from No Starch Press coming in 2023, and it's scheduled for February 7th, but I can tell you right now, it's not gonna be out February 7th. I've told the publisher to, you know, push that back a little bit, but it had taken pre-orders for it now, and it's actually selling pretty well in pre-orders already, so. - For everyone who's watching, what I really like about the situation is, Occupy The Web is obviously very technical, but he's written his own books, so he's an author. And what I wanted to try and do is get a updated list, but Occupy The Web, this is like really your opinion. What books would you recommend that someone buy or have a look at if they wanna become a hacker like you? And I mean, you've obviously got the Linux book, you've got your own books, but is there any of your favorite books? - [Occupy The Web] Okay, well, yeah, I've read most of the book, not all of 'em, but most of the books that are out there, obviously I'm in the business of writing books, and I read other people's books. So what I've done is I've compiled the books that I think are high quality and should be on your list to read if you wanna be a hacker, all right. So, let's start off with the obvious. The obvious is if you wanna start to get into hacking, you gotta start with \"Linux Basics for Hackers\", okay? I mean, that book was designed for just that purpose is that this is for, it meant to be small, compact, accessible, and give you the essentials of what you need to do to get started, right? So, that's number one. Not necessarily the best, I'm not saying it's the best, I'm saying it's a first in your path. - Now, let me play the nasty role just to keep this unbiased. I've had feedback from people that say the problem with your \"Linux for Hackers\" book as an example is it's also a bit old. - [Occupy The Web] Yes. - Are you gonna make perhaps looking at next edition of this perhaps or something? - [Occupy The Web] Yes, that's a fair comment. It was published in 2018. It was mostly written in 2017. I am in discussions right now with No Starch Press to come out with a new edition, a second edition, that's all gonna be updated and have some new material in 2023. So we hopefully you'll see that out in 2023. - And this book, it might be updated as well. I don't wanna jump again, is that right? - [Occupy The Web] That will be updated in 2023 as well. It was written in 2019. It really needs some new and updated material, so, we'll come out with a new edition of that in 2023. Then there's a number of other good books that are out there, and so I wanna mention a few of them. A few of them, I've got quite a few on this list that these are high quality, good books. - Just for everyone who's watching Occupy The Web hasn't told me which books he's recommending, so, it's gonna be a surprise for me just like you. But hopefully I've got some of the books and you know, so let's continue. - [Occupy The Web] \"Gray Hat Hacking\" right, is an excellent book. It's really big and really in depth. - I think I've just got the latest one six edition now. - [Occupy The Web] Six edition, there you go, you've got. - Six edition. And it's quite thick, yeah. - [Occupy The Web] Yeah, it's a big book. And so it has, it's got what? - 647 Pages or 670 pages? Sorry, I thought you were gonna talk about pages, but just talking about authors, sorry, go on. - [Occupy The Web] Yeah, it's got like six or seven authors, 2305 to rent, what is it? It's like 4634. It's a big book, lots of information. It's one of those books that you want to have as kind of a reference on your shelf, and I keep on updating it, which is good. So, it's always relatively up to date. So, that's one you wanna have. And if you can read the whole book, great. If you can't, then, you know, it's one of those books you want to keep on your shelf. There's another book that I really like a lot that is called, \"This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends\", okay? Which is written by Perlroth. She's a New York Times writer, and there's a lot of books out there. - This is not a techie book, is it? - [Occupy The Web] It's not, it's semi-technical, it's more about the industry. This is how they tell me number one Best Seller in Arms Control, okay? This seller tell me, The World Ends a Cyberweapons Arms Race, this is really a good book, right? So if you want something that's going to give you a relatively up to date perspective on what's happening in the hacking world, she's not a techie, but she has enough technical knowledge to be able to explain what's going on. And she interviews all of these hackers from all over the world. If you're just starting out and you wanna have some idea of what this world is like, you know, what the hacking world is like, Perlroth does a good job. She also has an audiobook, so it's one of those things that you could listen to on your commute or when you're not hacking. - I'll say this, Lex interviewed her, I'll put the link below, a great interview where you asked to. - [Occupy The Web] I'll have to watch that. This is a good book, I have read it. It gives you a real good overview of what is happening in hacking around the world on a global scale and how it's impacting security, how it's impacting law enforcement, how it's impacting geopolitics. So, she does a really good job. It's a book that I wish I had written, (David and Occupy The Web laughing) actually, I had been planning to write a book like this, but she did it before me, and she did a really good job, so. Okay, moving on then, the next book is one that I don't see often on people's best books list, but I like a lot. It's called \"Hands On Hacking\". I like it mostly for the way that he, it's Matthew Hickey and Jennifer Arcuri. - I got too many of these, I've got too many books. Yeah, it's like 600 pages about, yeah. - [Occupy The Web] It's a big book. I like the way that it's developed. I like the pedagogy of it, the way that they go through each of the different areas, that's the way that it should be done, right? I think the way the book should be developed. And so, I like this book a lot. Become an Expert at Next Gen Penetration and Purple Teaming. - You and I have spent a lot of money buying a lot of books, and I'm really glad that, you know, you said in the beginning, good and bad books so that, you know, people watching don't have to go and buy all the books, but just buy the books that you think are good. - [Occupy The Web] Yes. there's hundreds, hundreds of hacking books and most of 'em are bad. If you are looking for technical books, I think it's important going back to Perlroth's book. It's important for somebody who's starting out in the industry to get a perspective of what the industry is like not just from a technical perspective, but from a global perspective and that's why I like Perlroth's book. Some people like the books by Kevin Mitnick. I don't particularly, I mean, they're like fairy tales, you know, the Mitnick books, but for each their own, right? I don't particularly like them, so, they're not on my list. - I think the audience and for me, I want you to give us your opinion because you well respected, you've been in this game for a long time. A lot of people watching will have a limited budget, so it's nice to know the books that you recommend and why you recommend them. - [Occupy The Web] Next book is \"Penetration Testing\", A Hands On Introduction to Hacking. When this first came out, which was quite a few years ago now, it was really a great book. You can see some of it came out in 2014, so it's a little on the, a little long in the tooth now. I know that Georgia is working on an updated version of this, and that's Georgia Weidman. It's a good book. I say at one time it was a great book, but now it's kind of, because it's a little bit old, I'd say it's a good book and it's worth reading. She does a real good job here. - So, just by everyone watching, I don't know what's coming, so, I mean, I'm just having to see if I've got the books, but here it is. So, another quite a long book, worth it. - [Occupy The Web] I'm sure that you probably have a lot of these books. - 490 pages or so. - Yeah, 490 pages. - In other words, this is a bit older, but it's still relevant, right? - [Occupy The Web] I would say, you know, one of the things that Georgia does is that she's trying to teach you how to become a pentester. So, it's good for learning the mindset of a penetration tester, but the hacks are aged, they are old, right? So that's the drawback, but it's still useful in trying to learn how to be, what it needs to be, what the mindset you need to become a penetration tester, the process. Next, I wanna put on, my \"Getting Started Becoming a Master Hacker\". - What I like about your books is, I mean, this is not a difficult book to read. I'll just say this, I would've been surprised if you didn't mention your own books, but just so that it's not biased because people will say that you and I are biased. I'd say everyone go and have a look at the Amazon reviews, Amazon non-biased reviews, if you like. There's a lot of great reviews. So yeah, highly recommend your books as well. - [Occupy The Web] Thank you. It's designed once again for people who are just getting started into pen testing and hacking. I think that my books, you know, I try to make them easy to understand, I try to use simple language. I realize that a lot of people who are reading my books, English is not their first language, so, I try to keep that in mind when I'm writing and try to be as simple and language as possible without using a lot of technical jargon, right? So hopefully that's on your list of books that you should read in the near future. Next on my list is, you know, one of the things that is often overlooked by penetration testers, hackers is Social Engineering. There's a couple of good books, but the one that I like is \"Science of Human Hacking\". Now, Hadnagy has been controversial in recent years. He's had some problems, but his books are still good no matter what problems, personal problems he's had. This is a excellent book. The Science of Social Engineering. I think a lot of hackers kind of overlook social engineering. They all want the technical aspects of it. But as I've pointed out over and over again, even the best hackers in the world use social engineering to get inside the network, inside the system, oftentimes, usually. I would say at this point in the game in 2022, that you're probably looking at 80% or something better than 80% of the successful hacks have an element of social engineering. And Hadnagy does a good job of laying out the science of social engineering. So, give you a better understanding so that you're not just sending out a bunch of phishing emails hoping somebody will click on it, which I get hundreds of every day. So he's like, okay, what motivates people so that you can get them to click on the email or to give you the information that you want. I'll also point out that my \"Getting Started Becoming a Master Hacker\" has chapter 17 on social engineering. That tells you how important I think it is that I create a whole separate chapter on social engineering, which I think is important. Don't overlook social engineering, social engineering is a critical element of being a hacker. Next on my list is \"Black Hat Python\". Excellent book. You probably have this one too, don't you? - Yeah, just for everyone who's watching, I interviewed the authors. - [Occupy The Web] That's right, you did. I did see that, yep. Okay, well, here it is. You interviewed Justin Seitz, I remember that you had a interview with him. And this is a really good book. You know, it's Python, which is part of the skill set that you need to be a hacker. (indistinct) And mostly, there you go, okay. It's really probably the best Python book that is designed for penetration testers hackers. It starts off and just teaches you basic Python and then uses examples, kind of similar to my \"Linux Basics for Hackers,\" right? My \"Linux Basic for Hackers\" is designed to teach you fundamentals of Linux from a hacker's perspective. Justin Seitz and Tim Arnold teach you Python from a hacker perspective. So, there's a lot of good Python books out there. If you're looking at simply using Python in a hacking pen testing environment, I really like this one, I think you should read this one. - What I really enjoyed about that interview is how humble Justin and Tim Arnold, it's amazing. You really can see when someone knows their stuff, when they're not bragging about it, it's just part of them. And yeah, great authors, great book, yeah. - [Occupy The Web] Good guys, I don't know them. I can't even say that I watched all of the interview. I watched it part of it, I need a TikTok interview. (David and Occupy The Web laughing) - I'm going to do that. - My attention span is only 60 seconds. - You're showing your age, you're only 19. We gonna put you on the spot here. I'll keep, Occupy The Web, you've got it now, explain stuff in 60 seconds, so. - [Occupy The Web] I'll try, I mean, that's about my tension span, so I'm gonna have to do it. But I have constantly said that hacking is one of those things that takes a lot longer than you'll see on TikTok or YouTube. Oftentimes take years to actually complete a hack. But we'll try to condense some information into 60 seconds for TikTok. - That'd be great. - [Occupy The Web] Next on my list is, I know that you have an interview, you did an interview with Alissa Knight. - Yep. If you're interested in hacking cars, this is probably the best book out there. There's another book that's out there by Craig Smith that is okay, right? This One's better and more up to date, gives a better perspective of hacking cars. So, this is what I recommend. By the way, I'm doing a car hacking course next week, so probably it'll be already passed by the time you see this video. But this book is probably the best book on automobile hacking on the market right now. So, if that's an area that you're interested in, I think she's done a really good job of putting this book together. I like the way that it's designed, I like the information that's in it. And part of writing a good book is, how do you walk the people through the process? And that's one of the things I said earlier that I liked about \"Hands On Hacking.\" I like that book for the way it walks people through the process, the pedagogy of trying to teach people hacking. This is another good example of a well designed book that walks people through the process in a way that makes it understandable. Next, this is kinda an old one, but it's a goodie. It's probably one of the first books that ever was written. \"Hacking: The Art of Exploitation.\" A second edition still is kind of on the old side, if I remember correctly, right? This is a classic book that some of the things are still relevant, well written, well designed, another No Starch Press, I think No Starch turns out the best hacker books for those of you who are interested. Yeah, this came out in 2008. The original edition came out in like 2003 or something. - And you know it's old when it's got a CD in it. - How do you do fellow kids? - [Occupy The Web] Right, right. Good book though even though it's aged, I would recommend it. Now there's another book that came out in the last few years, \"The Pentester Blueprint\". Philip Wylie and Kim Crawley wrote this and it's gotten really good reviews and it's basically a starting a career as an ethical hacker. This is another excellent book, okay. It's mostly as a career guide, so, if you're new to hacking and you wanna make this your career or cybersecurity a career, this is a good place to explore what it means to work in this industry. And this came out I think in the last year or so, and these are people who, you know, these aren't people who are just writing, these are people who actually work in the field. They come at it from a perspective of people who are knowledgeable. The audio came out in 2021, I think the book came out in 2021 as well. - It's quite an easy book to read as well, I love it that he-- - [Occupy The Web] Well, it's pretty small. - Career stuff, yeah, it is. - I think it's less than 200 pages. \"Hacking APIs\", you've got that one, you've interviewed them, Corey Ball. - Yeah, I interviewed Corey. I'll put the link below as well. - [Occupy The Web] All right, another excellent book. No Starch again, okay. If you go to No Starch Press, you can't go wrong with their book. What No Starch does is they won't put out a bad book. They work really hard to turn out high quality stuff. I know the publisher pretty well and he's really committed to turning out quality stuff. The last one, I'm sure you have this book too, the Bug Bounty hunting book by Vickie Li. You interviewed her as well. - [David] Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'll put the interview below. - This book is probably the best book that's been published so far. Another No Starch Press book. Again, another plug for No Starch. It's probably the best book that's been written so far on Bug Bounty hunting. Not only how to get started, but then actually how to look for bugs in web applications. Primarily it's focused on web applications. Of course, Bug Bounty hunting isn't limited to web applications, but her book is designed for those who are looking and that's where most of the Bug Bounty hunting goes on as in web applications but it's not limited to that. So, her book is focused on Bug Bounty hunting of web applications. You can see that hers is the number one. Most of the books I've chosen have come back as number one in their category. That's not hard to do because Amazon has so many categories. (Occupy The Web and David laughing) And so, you gotta be number one in some place, right? But that's 13 books that I think are worth reading if you want to work in this industry. And there's not in any particular order, except that if you're really new to the industry and you're not familiar with Linux, start with \"Linux Basics for Hackers\". I think I can say that without any bias that that's the place to start. And then try to fill in, depending upon what interest and what area you want to go into within the hacking pentesting world, try to pick up some of these other books. You don't have to have all of 'em, but try to get some of them and try to give you some perspective on how you can develop a career within this industry. - One subject you haven't spoken about, so, I'm gonna put you on the line here, is like, networking. Have we got a networking-ish book? Because I think your \"Networking for Hackers\" is the book we should look at. 'Cause a book like this is just crazy. I mean, this is another No Starch, the TCP/IP guide. But if you like, if you're a networking type person, this kind of stuff is like-- - [Occupy The Web] That's about 800 pages or something. - This is crazy. - [Occupy The Web] There's so much detail in that book, that's kind of a reference book. And my \"Network Basics for Hackers\", which is coming in, should be on Amazon by the end of the year, is designed to give you the basics of networking. And unlike the TCP/IP guide, where are the vulnerabilities? How can a hacker use what they know about those networks to break them, right? Whether it be a cellular network, whether it be TCP/IP, whether it be a automobile network. So, it's designed once again with the hacker in mind to how to go ahead and break them. It's not designed to make you a network engineer, but to provide you enough information that you can find flaws in the network protocols. - And that's great. I mean, I think for everyone who's watching, put your comments below. Are there any books that you recommend in addition? I strongly would back that. A lot of the books he's mentioned I think are fantastic. I really wanted Occupy The Web to give us his, you know, personal recommendations because he's been in this game a long time and obviously as an author it's great to get his viewpoints. Occupy The Web, anything else you wanna say? I don't want to like end it at that point. Anything you wanna wrap up with? - [Occupy The Web] I just want to encourage people to not get discouraged, but it's 13 books in here. Go and grab, you know, one or two, or listen to them, get started. You don't have to read 'em all, in the six months or something like that. Make this kind of something that it's on your list that when you get to it, you'll read it. But if you're just starting out, some of these books are key, like \"Linux Basics for Hackers\", like the the Blueprint book, the \"Pentester's Blueprint\", those are good places to start your career. And then you can add the others as you go along. - So, let me put you on the spot. what do you think about this book, \"The Web Application Hackers Handbook\"? A lot of people recommend this book. - I know a lot of people recommend it, but it's pretty aged, you know. I find that the information in it is pretty outdated and if it was updated it would be great. When it came out it was a great book, but now it's specifically web applications and it doesn't include new technologies. What it does discuss in there is stuff that is 10, 15 years old. It came out in 2011, so it's been around like 12 years or so, 11 years. - This comes up a lot. We've spoken about Python, what about Go? So here's a book \"Black Hat Go\" from No Starch as Well, do you think it's necessary for people to learn a bit of Go or just stick with Python? - [Occupy The Web] Right now the dominant scripting language in our industry is Python. A lot of people are beginning to move to Go. And quite frankly, I've looked at that book and it looks good from what I can tell, but I haven't really read the whole book. I think a lot of people are moving towards Go. So, if you wanna kind of get out on the cutting edge, Go will probably be it, Go was developed by Google. It has a lot of advantages over some of the other scripting language, but right now Python is still probably 80 to 90% of the scripting that takes place in the industry. - That's brilliant advice. I think especially for beginners, it's overwhelming even the list that we've given. So, it's great that you like, give a bit of direction and just to plug for another video that Occupy The Web and I working on is Top Skills to Get. So, make sure that you watch out for that video. Make sure that you subscribe to the channel so that you see when that video gets released. But to continue with books, a lot of people also like \"The Hacker Playbook\", what do you think of these? - [Occupy The Web] I've read them and I don't particularly like them. Yeah, I know that a lot of people like 'em, but I don't. I think that there's a lot, it's kind of scattered. There's like all of these different hacks and not enough depth in them. So rather than taking a particular approach and then providing the depth, like, well try this out, and then try this out, and then try this out, and then try this out. So that's my impression of them is that, I know they get good reviews, a lot of people is on some people's best hacking books lists. I don't particularly like them, but that's just me. - Life is interesting because people have different opinions and you know, different views of things. And what I really like about getting your opinion, which I highly respect, is that, you've been doing this for a long time and you've been in the game a long time. You've bought a lot of books, some you like, some you don't like, but I think what's really great is you've given us a bit of a roadmap. So, if someone's got limited funds and they want to like start with some books, you've given them a great list to start with. So, really appreciate you sharing. - [Occupy The Web] Thanks for having me, David. I enjoy doing this again. - Brilliant, Occupy The Web, thanks so much. We'll speak to you next time. And just before we wrap up, for everyone who's watching again, put below in the comments questions, things that you want me to ask Occupy The Web in future YouTube videos, but also in TikTok. - [Occupy The Web] Let us know what you think and let us know what you want to hear about. Let us know what books you think are really good or not, what skills are important, what kind of videos you wanna see. And we'd be happy to try to accommodate that. - Occupy The Web, as always, thanks so much. (upbeat music)",

    "transcript": "now before I start making fun of this hundred-ish dollar PC I bought off of Amazon I do want to clarify the seller didn't actually list it as a gaming PC they just had gaming as one of its use cases for whatever that's worth oh and also add today's video sponsor is the sponsor I'd most likely share custody of a Labrador with lenode and just like the labrador we're getting together lenode is a Dependable Linux based cloud computing and web hosting service the note offers a whole host of Linux and core services like Storage Solutions cloud computing to database management and networking the node even has a new startup program called rise that'll help you establish easy Cloud infrastructure so you can get your startup that's going to revolutionize spelunking off the ground if that sounds good to you use the link below to get a 60 day 100 free credit for the node thank you I don't think I've ever had a computer delivered to me in a bag before so that's an exciting first wow that did not work if only there was some kind of clear instruction as to how to open the bag that really would help oh I love the Terry thing oh it's it's called the Fenty other than the beautiful Intel effect branding there's not a whole lot on the box it's called The Thin tt4 pro pro presumably standing for prostate because I can't imagine you using one of these professionally for anything which on that note in terms of specs has an Intel Apollo Lake series processor in it a frankly massive four gigs of memory it comes with 64 gigs of storage now it doesn't specify but considering the price point I'm assuming this is some poopy emmc storage but we'll figure that out soon enough and finally it does also come with an adapter very nice but on top we have our user manual again with Intel effect branding on it and then under that I'm guessing that's our little thin tee as maybe a bit of a stupid complaint but the loop that you use to pull the thinty up is kind of short and hard to grasp so it's not as comfy as it should be to pull the system out see look at that oops oh and then it tears there's a poor poor box showing right there so this is the Fenty which is smaller than I was expecting actually but under here we have our adapter look at that and as you can see by the specs of the adapter we got ourselves a seriously powerful gaming system for about a hundred dollars and it comes with an HDMI cable which honestly not many pre-built systems come with an HDMI cable so that's pretty good little finty and then finally we have the system itself which again is just tiny wow the thin d looks more like a Kirkland brand Chromecast than a PC now in terms of i o this thing is pretty badass we've got two USB 3 ports on the back with a microphone headphone jack and relatively lame power button and then on the right side we've got some ventilation to cool the power housed inside and another USB 3 port on the left aside from more ventilation we've got a CMOS reset button cool and then around the back we've got a physical ethernet port which is great another USB port and two HDMI ports this hundred dollar i o puts any Apple product a shame oh actually the bottom of it's also quite exciting we've got two what looks like quarter 20 threads so you can mount it to stuff and there's some grip tape so it doesn't slip around on your table oh it works well and with that considering that this looks like the kind of thing I may break in the process of opening it we're gonna have to jump to the Future after the testing to open it up so I just finished the testing and the results were frankly astonishing this is the only only accurate word for it really looking at the bottom I'm thinking that if there are screws they're hidden under the kind of grip here oh that is glue that is having to be destroyed there hey I predicted correctly is the genius that I am that there are actually screws under that tape just do that very easy Oh that's oh so cute we've got a little laptop style blower fan and then over here we have the CMOS battery and then under this bit of emo tape I think is the heatsink that cools the Behemoth Celeron just tear that off the boobs are fan it uses Samsung memory modules very fancy and next to that is the Wi-Fi card generally as far as heat sinks go this is quite an insubstantial put of cooling but combined with the fan for the Celeron that's in here this is actually kind of Overkill but we'll see later when we do some gaming on it and under that we have our tiny little Celeron die which considering that that is the only thing that does processing that's our CPU and our graphics card just to that little bit over there oh foreign on the back we've got some of the beefiest power delivery I've ever seen I'm actually worried about Roid Rage with these bad boys and in this module in close proximity of being brutalized by the power delivery is the gross 64 gigs of emmc storage and the last thing I noticed down here is the CMOS button which you can actually access through the chassis neat so that is what the inside of a hundred dollar PC for gaming off of Amazon looks like and as you can see we've got some monumentally powerful Hardware in here so let's see how it all runs games like it says it very much should be able to power cable is not very long 10 so it's been in a warehouse for a while although I'm not complaining now this is a system by a relatively small manufacturer so I am betting we are going to have basically no venereal disease on here it's just the Windows 10 venereal disease on here and nothing more than that which is is great I'm always excited to see that oh the CPU is having a rough time a hundred percent utilization idle on the desktop's never good although it's its first boot you know it's trying to find its bearings and whatever so hopefully it'll settle down soon now the CPU in question that's having a bit of a struggle is a seller on n3350 and that's the kind of thing you normally find in Chromebooks so I guess it's not that surprising that it's struggling with Windows 10 so much but it runs at a base speed of 1.1 gigahertz which is plenty for gaming I can imagine luckily the massive four gigs of RAM is not full so now what I'm going to do is plug some internet into it and then give it a while to sort itself out so that hopefully we we don't sit at a hundred percent CPU utilization on the desktop and then I'll do some gaming on it okay it's finally time for the ritualistic torture of the little mini PC how is it still loading it's been ages oh I love it when this happens to GTA 5. when you could like see this stuff rendering in that's when you know that you've got some Peak GTA 5 gaming experience and um it's it's it's four frames per second and actually I think you normally get a higher frame rate in the house so let's see what happens when we leave oh yes very very good gaming happening here now the thing about the really low frame rate is that it does kind of slow the gaming experience down a little bit you know it gives you time to savor what's happening because you're not being rushed by a frame rate that makes sense nice that's helped a lot uh it has in fact about doubled our frame rate which makes sense considering the resolution change hey we're almost getting 10 frames oh we've gotten over 10 frames per second now did it crash is it no no it just I don't know what happened there but we're we're back we're back it's running again oh very nice GTA 5 experience I love how even though it's barely rendering any of the map it didn't change the frame rate at all I mean one thing I will say the frame pacing is immaculate like look at how flat that graph is that's beautiful very consistent seven frames per second we have there 720p we're getting about 12 frames per second the seller was right this is great for gaming oh oh no even Bioshock is not doing very well oh never mind in this whole city shot we're getting about 18 frames per second a over 30 frames per second this is the closest to having a game actually run that we've seen so far okay now it may still feel like you're playing a game on your grandma's PC but it's kind of playable and we can actually drop the resolution further all the way down to 640 by 480. it still doesn't feel amazing that there is definitely a bit of input lagginess yeah this is not a great experience at all but it's usable that's cool that's actually kind of exciting that it it more or less Works a little bit I guess kind of not a very good Half-Life 2 performance it is a 1080p but we are inside and it's all at low settings and it's Half-Life 2 and we're not getting 300 frames per second so this thing is is really weak and outside we're at like 29. oh we that is not amazing uh let's drop it to 720p which I don't think I've ever had to do before when we have buildings and stuff in the shot it still drops below 40. that's crazy what happens when we crank the settings we're even gonna put some anti-aliasing on when we turn to a bit with stuff in the shot we're in the mid teens wow this is a loser-ass little PC next I tried some emulation on the little system it was fine with PS1 games like Crash Bandicoot but PS2 games like God of War really curb stomped the little system hey there we go we're getting some combat to happen look at that ha and finally I tried to run some cinebench R20 on the 100-ish dollar PC which went well now to put into perspective just how pathetically Meek this little system is cinebench R20 has been running for 45 minutes now and it's not even almost done yet the craziest part is it's the multi-core test it isn't even the single core one so it took the little PC pretty much exactly an hour to finish a multi-threaded cinebench run and we got a quite frankly astounding 81 points now the past couple of days of just waiting for this system to do things may have been one of the more frustratingly slow experiences I've had in ages when all is said and done I guess if your standards are low enough we did technically manage to play some games on it so five stars",

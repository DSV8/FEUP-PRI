    "transcript": "- Hey guys, this is the loudness war. Have you ever noticed how with some albums nowadays, if you listen to them on a really good pair of headphones, it doesn't sound that much better than on a not so good pair of headphones? Well, there's a reason behind that. The loudness wars, as they're called, came to a peak in 2008 with the release of Metallica's album Death Magnetic. And to the surprise of no one, it was loud. I mean, it was a metal album, after all. But it was arguably the loudest album ever, and that wasn't really a good thing. So, what do we mean by loud? Well, of course, there's the volume that you listen to the song at, which you have control of, but we're talking about the overall level of the song, as mixed by the producer. The loudness wars actually date all the way back to the 40s and 50s when radio DJs were actual disc jockeys. Now today, radio playlists are pre-determined, but back in the day, the DJ would pick their own playlist, and this meant going through their stacks of vinyl records. The poppier, and coincidentally louder songs, were more frequently picked by the DJ, and that wasn't by accident. Instead, this can be explained by the Fletcher-Munson curve. This curve is a measurement of how the human ear perceives different frequencies at different volumes. So, for example, when you listen to a song at a lower volume, the higher frequencies will be more pronounced, compared to the lower frequencies, aka the bass. But if you listen to the same song at a higher volume, both the highs and the lows are perceived equally, and they tend to sound much better. I mean, that does make sense, right? When you hear your favorite song, you wanna turn it up. Well, producers and audio engineers started to try and exploit that by mixing their albums a little bit louder than the competitors, but of course, this prompted other producers to do the same and so on, and so on, and so on. The way that audio engineers achieved this was through a technique called compression. So, here's what a song that hasn't been compressed sounds like. (pop music) And this is what it sounds like when you have compressed it. (pop music) While lowering the loud parts might seem counterintuitive, it means that the track as a whole, can get louder. And remember, louder is good, so mission accomplished, right? Well, there is one big drawback to mixing just for loudness and that is sacrificing dynamic range. Those soft and loud parts that get compressed, that's what makes music dynamic, airy, spacious. Imagine how lame Bohemian Rhapsody would sound if the entire song was the exact same level throughout? - [Matt] How would that sound? I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me He's just a poor boy from a poor family Spare him his life for his (Quinn and Matt laughing) Now, this wasn't really an issue back in the days of analog formats like vinyl records and cassettes, but then digital CDs were invented. You see, analog was a much more forgiving medium when it came to louder mixes. But with digital, anything over zero dB, which stands for decibels, results in clipping and that leads to distortion. When you apply additional data compression, say going from .wav to .mp3 file formats, the audio signal becomes increasingly distorted and it sounds, well, bad. When Metallica released Death Magnetic, the entire album was made available as DLC for Guitar Hero 3 and the Guitar Hero version didn't have the same level of aggressive compression as the CD version did. That's when fans realized how much better a dynamic version sounded. Thousands of fans petitioned for a re-release of the album which did get remastered in 2013. According to audio engineers, the loudness wars have finally ended, and you can, in part, thank iTunes for that. In 2013, Apple introduced a feature to iTunes and iTunes Radio, known as Sound Checker, which was an algorithm that attempted to normalize the overall volume of each song to be relatively consistent track to track, and as a result, there was no longer a big advantage to mix a song strictly for loudness. Now, most streaming services, such as Spotify, operate similarly. I wouldn't say it's entirely fixed though because while there are modern albums that are mixed amazingly well, like Daft Punk's Random Access Memories, other albums still seem too distorted. Part of the problem, I think, is that albums are often mastered for the devices that they're expected to be played back on, and when people play music through their crappy iPhone speaker and Airpods, well, albums are mastered accordingly. If you're interested in a set of headphones that actually can handle that sweet dynamic range, head over to my channel, Snazzy Labs, where I recently did a video on some of the best headphones under $50. Thank you so much for watching and be sure to subscribe to This Is. Just because the loudness wars are over though, doesn't mean that Matt's crappy music selection is fixed. - [Matt] Wow, wow!",

    "transcript": "- So there is a ton of really exciting tech debuting in 2019 and this past weekend I got a chance to check out something really exciting. Specifically Oppo's 10x Lossless Zoom camera tech. Which kind of blew my fricking mind. (upbeat music) Yo guys, Jonathan here. This past week I got to hang out in Barcelona Spain. Huge shout out to Oppo for sponsoring my trip out there. Got to attend the key note where they showcased 5G, their 10x Lossless zoom camera tech. Which gave us a really good idea of what to expect in their next Flagship which they said should appear sometime in Q2. Speaking of flagships, Oppo teased everyone essentially that was at the event with a prototype of their next 5G Flagship that was pretty much embedded into a table Ala King Arthur. And honestly I think the only person that may have been potentially able to rip that out of there was Cristiano, Qualcomm President, because that dude is jacked. (explosion) So if you're looking forward to that next Oppo Flagship you probably want to keep your eyes peeled on Qualcomm. They're working really closely together. They're a huge part of that 5G movement and as cool as that is, what really caught my eye was their 10x Lossless Zoom, which is crazy. So with the camera tech that Oppo showed off you have a triple camera set up. The main lens is a ridiculous 48 Mega Pixels. You then of course have your 120 degree wide angle lens, equivalent to 60 millimeters. Then you have the big mamajama. The Telephoto lens, which with optical zoom gets you all the way up to 160 millimeters, which is bananas. (upbeat music) There is a ton of really crazy tech packed inside. They essentially have this little mini para scope just jam packed inside there. The way it plays with light, there's optical instillation, the software talks with the hardware. And as impressive all that is none of it matters unless it works, and the crazy thing is it does. So Oppo had these giant miniature sets that looked like something straight out of Thomas and Friends. Shout out to Thomas the Train, bringing me back to my childhood. But the idea was you could take the phone take a photo, see how wide it was, and get really freaking close to take these mind blowing telephoto shots. And I got to tell you it did not disappoint. (upbeat music) So in this shot here I got JD standing across a table in this wide angle should give you an idea of how big the room is and also how far JD is away from me. So hoping over to the actual photos taken, here is that telephoto shot of JD which is no doubt impressive. It's clean, it's crisp, but you really don't appreciate how ridiculous this is until you go back to the wide. What the actual heck? Trying this again with Oppo showroom I'm zooming in to their logo at 10x it maintains the clarity and again you don't really appreciate this until you go back to the ultra wide. (dance music) Now this last shot where things started to die down a bit we really got a chance to test out this camera and shout out to JD for modeling through this chaos. He is about, really freaking far away from me, science. And with that telephoto shot it is essentially a waist up portrait, which doesn't really make sense because again, when you go back to that wide angle shot JD essentially turns into an ant. (upbeat music) So if that doesn't blow your mind I have no idea what else will. All I can say at this point is that I hope Oppo delivers and brings this into the next Flagship, because it is seriously exciting. It you guys wanna learn more on this or 5G, make sure you guys check out the link below. Thank you guys very much for watching. This Is Johnathan, and I will catch you guys later. I like feel myself getting cold. (laughs) - (Camera man) are you shivering? - I don't know man. It's like outbreak. I get life nothing happens to Mill house. So very very cold.",

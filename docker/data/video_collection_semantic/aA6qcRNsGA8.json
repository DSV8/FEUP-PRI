    "transcript": "today in another episode of dawid does dumb sarcasm which a lot of you seem to miss and then get weirdly triggered by for some reason we're gonna have a look at a laptop that i bought new from best buy for less than a hundred dollars and then we're gonna do the only thing i know how to do with it we're gonna try and game on it the seller took the time to use tamper evident tape which i mean isn't all tape closing a box technically tamper evident but anyway let's open it up wow never mind that tampering is evident hey it's a lenovo again hashtag definitely not sponsored that that bit wasn't sarcasm by the way now obviously for less than a hundred dollars we're getting a chromebook which i don't know if that really counts as a real laptop but i guess that's something for the galleries to find out in the comment section down below now this little lenovo chromebook is interesting because it's got a cpu in it that's not by intel or amd and then we've got four gigs of ram 64 gigs of emmc memory and we've got some integrated graphics in that non-intel amd cpu and also we get a frankly massive 11.6 inch hd display oh look at how cute this little 45 watt power brick is and that's one of the massive advantages of a chromebook because everything's so low powered you can make everything teeny weeny and super portable and then we have the mickey mouse air power plug again it's so little how the hell did this only cost a hundred dollars this is such a cute little laptop wow that feels rugged as hell oh it's such a cute well-made feeling little device for something that costs less than the tax on a lot of new graphics cards io is apple limited but at least this doesn't cost eight thousand dollars generally there's a nice mixture of textures even the little chrome logo is rubberized and feels pretty cool which is very impressive because for a hundred dollars even if this was made out of used bits of tissue paper i wouldn't really mind much does not pass the one hand open test you know it kind of looks like a tiny macbook the keystrokes bottom out quite hard but that is a very reasonable feeling keyboard actually damn especially again for a hundred dollar device we do have a very glossy reflective screen brightness may be an issue and like visibility in in well-lit rooms but we'll see that a bit later we even get this very useful full back hinge thing that turns it into like a tablet with a keyboard glued to the back you know even the texture of the trackpad isn't that bad we've got top firing speakers and then of course we have the standard lenovo hentai begone webcam blocker thing and then on the back we don't have any ventilation but you know it's because it's a chromebook it puts out less warmth than the soul of an nvidia exec which i think is a good point to bring up the specs this little lenovo chromebook is based around a mediatek mt8183 which is an arm-based soc which in mediatek's own words is an entry chromebook platform that is real promising for the gaming performance of this thing now for those of you that like to see laptop nudes you're going to be a bit disappointed because i just couldn't get it open i undid all the screws and then started tugging and squeezing and pushing while trying to pry the bottom off it felt like there were hidden screws i couldn't access without breaking something and i didn't want to hurt the poor little device and even if i did get it open it wouldn't have made any difference because everything inside is soldered down this really is like a little macbook and right there we can see a very reasonable use case for this little chromebook a little kiddo book now considering that this is a chromebook meaning it's essentially a cell phone in a different form factor it means we're gonna have to go about gaming on it a little differently so let's do it in phases starting off with just going onto the play store and seeing what basically phone games we can run on it mobile gaming the first one to show up is subway surfers i cannot believe that's still a thing i actually remember watching other kids play this on their cell phones while i was at school this has been around for a very long time when i first loaded into subway surfers it took me a while of shouting at the settings screen to figure out that i had to use the touch screen to play the game oh okay there we go i am very dumb and after trying to make excuses for my terrible gameplay okay touch screen's a bit hit or miss i'm not gonna lie so is the hit detection apparently ah i decided i really like subway surfers okay that sucks let's not play any more of that next i tried out roblox which doesn't count as a mobile game i don't think but it runs natively on the device so i do what i want wow here's a very poorly rated spider-man simulator i feel like i have to try that one now i may never have been in new york before but i can tell that this is a very realistic depiction of new york i have to buy the gauntlet that seems like pay to win that person just paid to win with their mom's credit card very nice unfortunately when things get busy the chromebook starts chugging it's not quite stab bamboo in your eyes to make it stop bad but unless you're playing emptier game modes it doesn't run very well well from the performance metrics we can see that we're clearly cpu bound and not gpu bound if i play it like this it actually works better than using a mouse or keyboard now a game like asphalt 9 um doesn't run particularly well like it's quite stuttery it's definitely usable but it's not what i'd call a great gaming experience at all and just to put the performance of this little soc into perspective i ran the only compatible 3dmark benchmark slingshot and got this result which is about 20 as fast as a high-end smartphone which immediately made me want to try some emulation on it initially getting retro arch to launch was really easy but everything beyond that was quite a struggle for example the only way i could get the xbox controller working with the chromebook was by actually plugging it in that isn't retroarch's fault but i just wanted to complain about it but anyway after some mild shouting i eventually got a ps1 game running okay after many hours of struggling i finally got retro arch running and crash bandicoot is running very nicely now considering how in the middle of the display the game is it does feel a bit like we're gaming on a casio digital watch but there are settings to fix that which i'll change while i switch over to a more demanding ps1 game oh yeah look at that gran turismo 2 action i mean it's running the crap out of these ps1 games which brings us to the final hurdle all chromebooks must face geforce now hmm so it's been loading for about 10 minutes now feel like that's a reasonable point to back out damn this little chromebook can actually run geforce now in a way that doesn't make it feel like the device i'm gaming on is mid heavy drug binge that is actually reasonably responsive and it doesn't look like complete garbage we don't have heavy artifacting going on what makes it even more impressive is that it's just over the wi-fi we haven't even plugged it into ethernet yet normally with this kind of device streaming geforce now over the wi-fi looks like it's streaming at 140p but this is way better does it get better if we plug it into the internet i don't know if anything using the dongle ethernet makes it worse but it's basically the same really surprisingly usable let's try another game now of course we need to try fortnite which in my previous experience is one of the better running geforce now games it's a little stuttery but it's not too bad and in terms of like input lag and stuff it it feels pretty good the display is very small though so ah yeah fortnight it's not a great gaming experience you know like it's gonna be harder to see players at a distance and stuff and the unfortunate thing about geforce now and it being a game streaming service is that its performance very much depends on where you live which means it doesn't really apply to everybody which which is a shame but putting that aside i am so impressed with how well this little media tech entry level soc is running this game streaming because i've seen celeron based chromebooks really struggle with it and with that what did we learn in today's video well for half the price apple charges for eight gigs of ram you can get like a mini macbook that can kind of game which is pretty cool and that brings me to the end of the video thank you for watching if you enjoyed it consider watching another one a suggestion will pop up in a second and until the next video bye you",

    "transcript": "- Hey, hey, you, you. Get into this tech news that I collected for today's video 'cause it took me a while, and yeah, I was thinking about you the whole time. That's not that weird. Ubisoft has announced that the online services for 15 of the publisher's games will experience a decommissioning. It's a symptom of being a digital-only gamer in the year 2022, and it's actually quite normal. The affected games will no longer be able to access multiplayer modes, or install and play purchased DLC. Now if we're being super charitable, I'd say maybe it's understandable that a company trying to optimize server space might do this for the single-player games on the list like \"Anno 2070,\" a number of \"Assassin's Creed\" games including the excellent \"AC II,\" and \"Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands.\" But \"Space Junkies\" is a multiplayer-only VR game from 2019, which will be completely unplayable after September 1st. And to make matters worse, \"Assassins Creed III\" and \"Far Cry 3\" are losing access to DLC, but only the original versions. If you bought the remastered copy, you will continue to have permission to download and play the content you paid for. That's so nice. Now let's not bash on Ubisoft's leadership too hard. After all, CEO Yves Guillemot voluntarily only took half of his $650,000 bonus this year because the company isn't doing as well as it hoped. So Ubisoft could either cut off gamers' access to game content they bought, or what? Continue reducing their executive's bonus payments? Dip into their salaries? (laughs) That's really funny. Leaks about upcoming PC hardware, including NVIDIA's RTX 40 series GPUs are flowing copiously as the summer goes on. With industry leaker, whose name, I don't know how to say, kopite7kimi kopite claiming some wild numbers for the RTX 4090's clock speeds. In addition to benefiting from the new Ada Lovelace architecture, Dr. Kimi says the RTX 4090 has a base clock of 2,235 megahertz with a 2,520 megahertz boost clock, which is 50 to 60% higher than the RTX 3090. Amateur analysts doing some back of the napkin math have also calculated that this means the 4090 will be capable of over 90 teraflops of compute horsepower, almost twice the teraflopability of the RTX 3090 TI. Oh man, I cannot wait for these superpowered graphics cards to launch so I can intentionally ignore them and buy an older GPU because GPU prices being 200% above MSRP was not a good place to be. We can't go back there. You can't make me go back. And in other Nvidia news, the company seems to be aware that demand for their probably way too expensive GPUs isn't going to be as high as they thought it would be back when they put these things into production. So they're reportedly asking chip manufacturer TSMC to cut Nvidia's orders of five nanometer wafers designed for the RTX 40 series. Now, AMD and Apple, two of TSMC's other big customers, are also cutting orders, but it seems like Nvidia may be the biggest offender here as TSMC is reportedly only agreeing to delay the orders, not cut them, and is also demanding Nvidia find replacement customers so TSMC isn't left holding the bag. I mean, you gotta feel for Nvidia here. Demand is down for these overpriced GPUs among gamers because they're actually able to buy them again, and also among crypto miners, leaving no one to buy new GPUs from poor Nvidia. I hope they'll be okay. Dennis, don't worry. It's Nvidia. Now it's time for quick bits, brought to you by iFixit Mahi Driver Kit, or as the iFixit team calls it in the office, The Beast. I just made that up, but I have a gut feeling it's accurate because the Mahi includes iFixit's 1/4-inch aluminum screwdriver handle with a magnetic bit socket, knurled grip, and swivel top which can deliver powerful repairing force using the 48 steel driver bits included in the kit. From Phillips to flathead to spanners, squares, and splines, these are individually selected using data from thousands of repair guides to find the most helpful ones. They just wanna help. So help yourself at iFixit.com/techlinked and upgrade your toolbox with iFixit's Mahi Driver Kit for just 34.99. Wow. Quick bits are the future. All the kids are gonna be doing it soon. Watch out on TikTok. Speaking of TikTok, China may have just experienced the largest cybersecurity breach in the country's history after unidentified hackers claimed to steal more than 23 terabytes of data from a Shanghai police database and tried to sell it online. The data reportedly includes names, addresses, national IDs, and phone numbers of a billion Chinese residents, as well as criminal case information. Who knows, maybe the hackers are trying to even things out since ByteDance apparently has the personal information of every TikToker and the top executives go through it for fun every night before they go to sleep. I don't like that they do that. Well-known leaker Greymon55, maybe they're buddies with kopite, who knows, has added fuel to rumors that AMD will be releasing more 3D V-Cache equipped processors for the current gen AM4 Socket. Team Red's existing Ryzen 7 5800X3D could be joined by a Ryzen 9 5900X3D or a Ryzen 5 5600X3D which could provide a tasty upgrade for anyone still lukewarm on the idea of AMD's upcoming AM5 Socket which will have pins on the motherboard Intel style instead of a bunch of holes for the pins on the Ryzen CPU to drop into. It was so satisfying putting things in holes. It just always feels good. Chinese company Xiaomi has unveiled their new flagship smartphone, the Mi 12S Ultra, which comes with a big old one-inch sensor on its main camera. It's not the first phone to incorporate a sensor size more commonly found on dedicated point-and-shoot cameras, but it is one of the more mainstream models to actually use the full sensor, instead of just part of it like Sony's Xperia Pro I1. Do I think you should get this phone? No, I just thought you would want to know about it because of our conversation last week. You know, about... Meta is finally drawing the torturous saga of the company's doomed Libra cryptocurrency project to a close with the announcement that their digital wallet Novi will shut down on September 1st. Users are being asked to withdraw their funds ASAP, but don't think that this means Meta's outta the crypto game. They literally changed their name because they're full on into the metaverse, which will sadly go hand in hand with crypto, Web 3, synergistic transmogrification of e-commerce, and let's not forget digital cyber presence to phase shift analog identity into the virtual. Sorry, I just had a stroke. And once they were mocked, but now M.2 SSD coolers are definitely a thing, as you can see by looking at this tower-style SSD heat sink with an included 60-millimeter fan from Chinese component maker JiuShark. And while this kind of cooling might still be overkill, SSD coolers might actually be necessary soon with PCI 5.0 drives on the up and up. So don't make fun of your PC gaming brethren for making sure their components are nice and comfortable. That tower cooler might be the difference between losing the match and losing it by slightly less. You're the problem. And our problem is that we're outta tech news, so come back on Wednesday for more. I'm going to go start working on that one because if I know you, you're gonna want a bunch. And there's so much out there, I just want you to be happy.",

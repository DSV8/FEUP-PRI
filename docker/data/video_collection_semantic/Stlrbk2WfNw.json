    "transcript": "- Oh boy! Happy 2021! Everybody, we made it. And this is my first video of the new year. Hi, first of all, I'd like to say, thank you guys for all of the support last year. Last year was obviously crazy for everyone. And I think the we're all hoping that this year is gonna be much, much better. Obviously things started out a little crazy this past week. And if you wanna know how I felt about it, I was pretty vocal on Twitter and on Instagram as well. So I'm not gonna get into it here, but my sister and I started a podcast last year. So thank you guys so much for supporting it. It's called \"Same Brain.\" We have Same Brain mugs. I'll put a link in the description if you wanna check these out and also if you wanna check out our podcast. But why I'm bringing that up is because we filmed the podcast on Tuesday and in the podcast, we said this, We're not sure yet. - It's Tuesday that we're filming this. So we have a couple of days. - We do. Oh my gosh, I hope your crazy news breaks by the time this comes out, and if there is. - What's gonna happen, you know? What's the worst that can happen? (Tyler laughs loudly) - That was a clip from Tyler who was actually editing this video and he edited the podcast. I don't know why we really thought that we weren't going to have any crazy news. So if you're wondering why we're not talking about it in the podcast on Saturday, that's because we clearly recorded it ahead of time. (mug thuds) So this being the first episode of \"Ask iJ\" in 2021, I asked you guys on Twitter if you guys had any questions and of course you guys came through with that hashtag #askij. Let's just get into the questions. Like why are we even wasting any time talking about anything else? This one is from Mark. He was asking if we can collab this year. Yes Mark, count me in. Walter is asking, what do I think about the people that use bots to buy up graphics cards and consoles and sell them at a much higher price on eBay? There is a special place for them. And I will tell you where it is. It's a place that burns, it's fire. Emily is asking what would I say has been my favorite moment throughout my career? I would say probably my favorite part was going on my book tour because it really gave me a sense of my audience. Obviously I've been creating videos for a really long time that I don't actually ever really see you guys. Now I see you sometimes at VidCon, but I was traveling around The US and to really get to kind of go to where you guys are. It was really fun, and I do hope that one day I will be able to do that again. Here's a tweet from Ryan who is wishing me a good holiday. What is something that I'm looking forward to most in 2021? And also what are the chances you could convince Henry Cavill to do a gaming video with you? I think we would all enjoy watching you go toe to toe with The Witcher himself. Okay, this is a two-part question. Something that I'm most looking forward to in 2021 is quite simple. It's being able to solve a four by four Rubik's cube. I'm almost there. I've figured out how to get all of the center pieces to match but this was something that really occupied a lot of my time in 2020, mostly because I got a concussion. And obviously I couldn't go to the doctors. We're in the freaking middle of a pandemic so I did what any person would do who hit themselves in the face really really hard with their iPhone would do, is you Google concussion symptoms. You tweet about it and you get the feedback from you guys. The number one thing that they said to do was, keep your brain active, do some brain games. So I thought of always wanting to learn to solve a Rubik's cube. So why not try to solve it with my concussion to keep my brain active. And well, I'm not a speed cuber by any means but we've got this one down. Next up, four by four. What was your question? Oh, what are the chances I could convince Henry Cavill to do a gaming video with me? I don't know him personally. I don't know him at all. So if he is interested in doing a gaming video, oh my gosh, that'd be really fun maybe me and Jenna can get him on our podcast. I saw that he had Nvidia 3090 that he was installing on Instagram. So I'm definitely very jealous about that. I wonder what games he likes. Does anybody know what games that Henry likes? If so, leave them in the comments below. I hope he likes Call of Duty. He doesn't really seem like an animal crossing type of guy, but you never know. Speaking of \"The Witcher\" I actually did watch \"The Witcher\" over the holidays. It was incredible. Jeff is asking me what I feed Matty. Matty is my dog for anybody who might be new here and not aware. He eats lamb. He has a freeze dried lamb diet that he's on now. And it's actually been really incredible because he previously had a lot of trouble with his diet. He had so many different food allergies, and finally we put him on this primal lamb and he's been eating it. He loves it, and he's gained a little bit of weight. Fat food must've been upsetting his stomach and now he's a healthy, really needy little boy. CHLFC, actually is a bunch of really great questions here. How often do you cover accessibility? I don't actually cover it that often, but I do have all of my videos closed captioned, which is, I think, a step in the right direction. Do you think you cover accessibility enough on your channel? I actually don't think that I do. So I think that should be something that I strive to do more of in 2021. Would you consider making a disability special, the good, the bad, the important work still to do in 2021? I would love to hear some more of your suggestions, CHLFC and also from you guys in the audience as well. Feel free to leave me some comments below, tweet me because I would love to cover accessibility more. I think it is kind of difficult because I'm not really sure what to cover but I think the first step would be maybe talking to people who are in the community and they would be able to offer suggestions. I really love hearing suggestions from you guys. Like it was a while ago, somebody told me that they really loved watching my videos because I was very descriptive on when I was talking about an item. I would make sure that I said how it felt, you know, like the weights and the feel and just be more verbally descriptive for people who aren't able to see what I'm talking about. And that's something that I had never even considered. So I think being vocal and telling your favorite creators things that they can do better. Like we're not going to be taking offense to it. Like we need to know what we can do to be better. Because if you don't tell us, like we don't know Cullen is asking, who is the lovely sponsor of this video? Cullen is trying to set me up for a sponsor, if we have one. I actually should have had a sponsor for this. There is one that I could have integrated into this but to be completely honest with you, I didn't feel like reading the rest of the email. So there is no sponsor for today's videos but I'm honestly so grateful over this past year for all of these sponsors who sponsored my content. Behind the scenes, it's definitely a struggle. I am so grateful though, to have still been able to work. But a lot of projects that I had planned for last year, a lot of them fell through. So thankfully a lot of sponsors had stepped up. So super grateful for that and super grateful for all of you guys who support the sponsored content because it really does mean a lot to all of us creators. Brandon is asking, what do you use to organize your content, your video planning? I wish that I had some sort of crazy system for you. I basically use the Notepad. Like I use the Notepad for everything, like on my Mac. I've seen a lot of my creator friends who started using Notion. So that's something that I just recently set up. The simplest thing for me right now is just using the Notepad because it's on my phone, it's on like my laptop, my iPad. And then if I am doing something that requires a PC, I will use Microsoft's OneDrive because that's on my phone, it's on my PCs and it's also on my iPhone and I can also get it on my Mac as well. So that's something that I use a lot just to sort of keep myself organized when I'm doing cross-platform stuff. Sidney is asking, what is one piece of tech that I'm most excited for this year? I'm really excited for vaccine tech, in all seriousness I think smart home tech is something that I'm very very interested in, ways to kind of make the home easier to be a work from home experience. Because the way that the world was, is never going to be the same for better or for worse. I think that we will find out. So I think just trying to work through what those new ones ways of working are, will be interesting. Is there going to be tech involved? Probably. I look forward to checking it all out. Speaking of tech that I'm excited for, Roberto Blake is asking, what is the next great adventure for Justine? Hi, I'm Justine and my next adventure, I'm going to CES, CES 2021. Now CES is now going all digital. And it's really exciting because they kind of reimagined what CES was. They took all of the things that you loved about CES, the meetings, the keynotes and the booths and all of this, and kind of turned it into this really cool digital experience. I'm very excited about it. I'm also one of the hosts. Very fun, very exciting. But this is the first time that I'm going to be working on actual production since, maybe like over a year, to be honest with you. Because even at the beginning of last year, I think, it's been a while. So I'm excited, I'm nervous, but I'm very confident in their COVID officer compliance teams. It's really interesting the way that the entire production world has completely changed and evolved. There's so much behind the scenes that now has to happen to even be able to have a production put into place. With that being said, I'm going to be so extra careful. But I'm excited for you guys to experience the new all digital CES. Bench Fiddler, my fellow animal crossing villager friend. Will you go to Super Nintendo World in Japan, opens next month? Or will you wait for one to be built in The US? Let's say there's no COVID and you can fly anywhere. I would a 100% be there. I would have been there opening day without a doubt. Like, do you think there's a doubt? No, none. There's absolutely not a doubt I would have been there. I've actually never been to Japan. So that is somewhere that I've always really wanted to go. I used to travel almost every single week, every other week, very, very frequently. So I'm definitely cutting down on that. I'm doing only essential travel. If that, like, if I don't have to travel like I'm not going to do it. RELkay is saying \"Folklore\" or \"Evermore.\" Obviously Taylor Swift was such a highlight for me, of last year. I feel like Taylor, she really did reinvent herself with both of these albums. I think that I liked \"Folklore\" more but I also don't want to say that because I feel like they both kind of tie together very well. That listening to them kind of both together is kind of the way to go. There's really great songs on each album. But I think if I had to pick, I probably do like \"Folklore\" more. I was definitely in a completely different place when I was listening to \"Folklore\". So \"Folklore\" definitely got me through some really tough times. \"Evermore\" really kind of picked up where that left off. But for me personally, being in a completely different mindset from where I was when that album came out, I don't know. It's really wild how music can sort of mess with you. Oh my gosh! And I'm at the end of my questions. I don't even know what to say now. It's over. The video is over. I guess, thank you for watching. Don't forget to subscribe, hit the bell, like this video. How else do we end these videos again? I'm not sure. I think one of the things that I need though is a new end slate because this one is quite old. But for now here's the old end slate. See you later. (upbeat music)",

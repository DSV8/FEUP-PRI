    "description": "You can support this channel on Patreon!  Link below These days, it seems everyone wants the latest and greatest equipment for the audio needs.  But there's a lot of fantastic hardware you can find in thrift stores and enjoy today.  I've found that with a little patience, you can find true high fidelity speakers from the best brands, and though they may need some TLC, I think the results are worth it.  Guide for replacing foam surrounds:  This is a decent guide, but I'd like to ad that removing the dust cap and shimming the voice coil isn't strictly necessary.  If the driver's spider is intact, the dust cap should remain perfectly centered.  It is easy to get replacement dust caps, but if your speakers have decorative or interesting driver designs (like the translucent cones in the Infinity RS-2000) you might want to try leaving the dust cap as it is.

    "transcript": "If youve seen some of my earlier videos, you may have noticed one of these speakers. These are Infinity RS-2000 bookshelf speakers, originally from 1988. I picked 4, yes 4, of these up from Goodwill for $5 apiece. They all had busted foam surrounds on the woofers which required replacing, but with an eBay purchase of new surrounds and a little Elmers glue later, they were working perfectly. These speakers are certainly nothing state-of-the art, but they are a decent little bookshelf speaker. In fact, I quite like these. Im no audiophile, and it looks as though this particular model never really achieved anything more than a lukewarm reception among the audiophile community, but I think they sound great. Ive grown to appreciate clarity and definition more than a booming bass, so the limited bass response on account of the 6.5 inch woofers doesnt bother me much. I use these on my desk as computer speakers, and the other pair sits hooked up to my TV. And let me tell you, I dont think theres a better option out there if you want fantastic sound for cheap. And thats what this video is about. Now of course, audiophiles in the audience are gonna argue with me and themselves, so Ill just say: your mileage may vary. This video is based on my personal experience and opinions. These speakers might not sound great to you, and Im sure there are better options, but having spent just $60 all in for 4 speakers and an amp, I think it turned out pretty well. To start with, speakers. You might be surprised what speakers youll find in a thrift store. It does take some luck and patience, but here are some hints. When hunting in a thrift store for speakers, theres one thing you should do before putting too much thought into any speaker: pick it up. True hi-fi speakers are heavy, usually because theyre filled with dense acoustic foam or fiber. The cabinets tend to be made of better and thicker materials, too. If you can effortlessly pick up a shoe-box size speaker with just one hand, put it back down. For reference, these speakers weigh about 12 pounds apiece. Brands to keep your eye out for include Infinity, JBL, Harman Kardon, Bang and Olufsen, Bose, Klipsch, and others. This is very much a generalization, but speakers from big electronics brands are often not too great. A speaker boasting a Sony or Panasonic logo probably isnt that fantastic, since it probably came from an all-in-one, mass produced system. Im sure there are exceptions, but something out of a home theater in a box or a dedicated bookshelf system likely wont be too exceptional. You also want to check to see how the speakers are hooked up. A speaker with wires permanently attached to it is probably a no-go. Thats a tell-tale sign that it came from a boxed system. You want to see old-fashioned speaker terminals or screw posts. Especially avoid speakers with 2 pairs of wires or connections. These dont have a crossover of their own to drive the woofer and tweeter separately, which definitely means theyre from an all-in-one system. Next, you want to check the speaker drivers for signs of damage. Good speakers will usually have fabric grilles that can easily be removed simply by pulling them forward. If the drivers have cracked or blown foam surrounds, its not necessarily the end of the world. Like I said, all of these Infinitys suffered from this, and Im sure thats why they ended up in goodwill. But Its not hard to replace the surrounds, and Ill put a link in the description to a good guide for doing so. Another good thing to check is if any drivers are stuck. Im not sure how often this happens, but I have a pair of JBL speakers which had a completely seized woofer. Check for this by gently pressing on the woofer to see if it can move. You can also do this with a mid-range driver, but you shouldnt do it to a tweeter. Tweeters can be very fragile, and you wouldnt be able to tell anything by feel, anyway. Which brings me to the next bit: you probably wont be able to test a speaker you get until youre home and can hook it up to your amplifier. If you should find that one of the drivers is dead, fear not! Its often easy to obtain a replacement. Search around for a website specializing in speaker repair and youll find plenty of options. Of course, this will alter the sound of one of your speakers, so you should buy a pair of replacements and replace both drivers. And I know, thats not exactly ideal, but hey, better than a broken speaker, I say. Ideally you would find a direct replacement of the exact same part number to prevent altering the speakers sound. But good luck with that These are the JBL speakers which had the seized woofer. I use these with my stereo, and theyre pretty good to my ears. Not as detailed as the inifitys, though. Youll also notice that they are white. Whered the old-school wood grain go? Well, here you can get creative. One of the nice things about buying old speakers for pennies is that you can do crazy things like paint them or replace the speaker grille cloth without regret. And in this case, Ive done both. I would have been happy to keep the original finish, but these were very beat up and needed some TLC anyway. I figured, why not go with something a little more modern? And finally, what about an amp? The audiophiles will not be happy with this, but I really like these little 20 watt amplifiers you can get on Amazon for $20 or so. Theyre perfect for a PC setup, and can rest next to your monitor rather unobtrusively and you still have access to the volume and tone controls. Or, if youre feeling adventurous, you can mount them to the underside of your desk for even more flexibility. Unfortunately the quality of these seems to have dropped in recent years, so its definitely worth reading the reviews, but for a small speaker like this, 20 watts is plenty. In fact, the spec sheet recommends amplifiers from 15 to 75 watts, so while 20 is on the low end, it isnt starving the speaker. Most speakers from the same time period will work well with an amp of this size. These little amps usually accept a 3.5 mm mini-plug in addition to RCA cables, so if youre fine with the blasphemy that is running them from your motherboards built-in DAC, all you need is an \"aux cable\". Personally Ive never been bothered by using the computers own analog output, and I think these days theyre all pretty decent, though it should be noted that for my particular setup, my monitor is actually working as the DAC, taking digital audio via displayport and sending it out to the amp via the headphone jack. And, thats it! I know, this isnt for everyone. Maybe the idea of shopping in a thrift store isnt your cup of tea, or perhaps youre not as crazy as I am. Also, you might have better ears than me and think these arent even worth $5. But for my money, I think these are excellent. The biggest downside I face with these is that, well, theyre kinda big. They eat up a good deal of my desk space. But I dont mind. Also, while the oak veneer works well with a black desk, Im not so sure it will work with the new bamboo-topped desk I have on its way. Overall I actually quite like the design of these, especially with the floating black grille cloth, but the finish is rather intensely dating itself. Perhaps Ill refinish these, too. Anyway, thanks for watching! If youre ever on the lookout for a new speaker setup, why not take a trip down the path of oddities and see whats available outside of your traditional retailer. You might be impressed with what you can find.",

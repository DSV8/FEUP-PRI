    "transcript": "now in the last video while testing the little cybertruck mini PC, it was clear there was quite a lot of performance Headroom left in it I mean it is a high-end laptop CPU gaming on its igpu so you'd kind of hope so and in today's video we're going to try and extract as much performance as possible from that CPU of course we're going to do it in the dumbest way possible this is a 4090 by the way [Music] now this is a process that I imagine isn't going to be straightforward because our little mini PC doesn't conveniently have a 4090 shaped hole we can just stuff this into but luckily it does have a truck bed so you know it it kind of fits quite nicely on the wedge shape of it but now we need to figure out how to plug it in now my first thought was to just use an m.2 to PCI Express adapter from the glory hole on the bottom and then plug the graphics card in that seems pretty straightforward the problem is though I'm pretty sure this is the only accessible m.2 slot on the mini PC so if we plug a graphics card into it where are we going to plug our storage in but anyway to weigh all our options I think we're going to have to tear this thing down again uh which I'm a bit worried to do cuz it pretty much broke a bunch of it the first time I tore it down so hopefully I don't break more of it but we're going to have to do that to see what kind of options we [Music] have okay so that's our one very easily accessible m.2 slot there is another one but it's got a bit of a [Music] problem and here's slot number two but as you can see there's a there's a pretty clear problem with it it's blocked by the side of the car so because all the ports on this random board they found in a parts bin doesn't line up with the construction of the car we can only use one m.2 device although maybe we can make a plan and the plan was to just cut a hole in the side of the Mini PC to stick an SSD through but there was immediately a problem oh no the slot's in a really bad spot it's in line with the back wheel with concern Brewing that my only option was to just run the system naked on the desk so I could access all the holes I decided to go look for some more options and a few moments later I also found this adapter which is another option which converts an m.2 Wi-Fi card slot into PCI for us to plug a graphics card into it is a 4090 though so I don't think this is going to go super well in terms of bandwidth or even work I can't remember so let's quickly test this one out and then we'll take it from there I guess this little adapter is keyed for m.2 y Wi-Fi as opposed to just a normal m.2 slot so that means we are going to lose Wi-Fi capability but we're going to gain 4090 capability so I think that's a worthwhile tradeoff and then we have to struggle to pop the Wi-Fi antenna off oh yeah we also need to plug our storage back in [Music] oh yeah this looks perfectly reasonable now we just need to plug it in and see if it works to plug everything in I had to rearrange the setup a little bit but soon I was ready for my first test fire I don't know I feel like this is a very brave first attempt because I can't imagine that it's just going to Output video here as opposed to over the igpu without any intervention uh but we'll see I was right the system refused to Output a signal so I swapped back to the mini P's video output with some promising results oh that's crazy it finds a basic display adapter because we don't have Internet it can't find drivers for it but that's very promising but unfortunately the very limited bios didn't have an option for us to switch over to a different graphics card so the BIOS option didn't work so now I'm going to install drivers for the graphics card and then see if I can switch it over that way nidia's drivers had no problem finding the 490 and installing but it didn't give me the option to switch outputs over however it did give me the option to render games on the 4090 and then just use the igpus video out but initially games would just crash with that option enabled so I went into the BIOS changed some more settings and finally got a game to run technically on the 490 okay well it didn't immediately crash when I applied settings which is good enough for me so let's properly reassemble our cyber truck Mini PC so we can see how this external GPU setup runs in style now what means that this setup is potentially going to work really easily is that this is right below the chairs in the cabin of the car and those chairs are removable and have like a hole underneath them so we could use that hole to Route this cable very easily but while I reassemble this system let me quickly explain to you why this adapter is probably going to devastate our gaming performance an m.2 Wi-Fi card slot isn't quite the same as the m.2 slot that you'd plug your very fast nvme storage into an m.2 Wi-Fi card slot only has two pcie lanes available as opposed to the four on a normal m.2 slot let alone the 16 lanes that the 4090 is used to so this little adapter is the graphics card equivalent of autoerotic asphixiation which I guess does that mean it's going to run better I don't know whatever at least it'll look cool okay so I'm just going to feed this out the back door and then we have a seamless way to strap a graphics card to its roof [Music] okay well it's not quite in the correct place I wanted it more in the truck bed but cable length is cable length and it still looks pretty cool ooh the Boop power button is a bit broken but it's still kind of usable oh no Counter Strike 2 is running significantly worse than it was on the igpu that's we're going to have to go into the BIOS and see if there's something we can do about this and after changing some bio settings it kind of helped okay well these settings are a lot better than what we were getting before I mean significantly better but we're still getting about half the performance we got with the igpu which isn't great considering that we have the mightiest GPU around lying on the cyberp punk truck so after testing these games I definitely have to ghetto rig some m.2 ocul link action so that we can get proper performance from this aside from that the power draw is also hilarious on our 490 oh Doom Eternal at 1080p medium settings is running better than on the igpu I mean barely but it's better and better is an improvement now one of the main reasons I wanted to try this was to see if we could fix the really bad stutters we were getting in cyberpunk with the little cyber truck oh well there you go all we had to do was drop a what $1,500 graphics card on the cyber truck PC and it's kind of fixed our stutters it's not gone that's still not a smooth frame time graph but it's definitely running at least marginally better than it was on the igpu bumping up the resolution to 1440p doesn't lose us any frame rate which is interesting and I guess makes this whole setup completely worth it so now that we've seen the kind of Devastation rot to A System's performance by using a Wi-Fi card slot even a modern one to plug a graphics card into it let's have a look at an ocul link setup the first step was to tear the Mini PC down for the 17th time today to reveal both its succulent m.2 slots and just like that we've got easy access to our second m.2 slot and the system is like more or less still fully assembled and how this works is pretty straightforward first we pop in the little m.2 connector which uh um we don't have a way to screw down oh I have an idea there we go problem solved and then we have our little PCB that we can use to connect our 490 with plug that in and then we need to use my 3D printed gaming mouse to fail at wedging up the graphics card so and unfortunately we do lose Boop technology here but oh oh my word I forgot to turn the power supply on for the graphics card just briefly though just briefly we're good oh wait it worked it did it just fixed itself very good now I'm going to test the system using the same settings as before which is a really stupid way to run a 4090 but it's a good way to have consistent results oh yeah there we go we're getting 250 frames per second with our GPU doing nothing this is a lot more what I was anticipating in all fairness this is still not what I was expecting in terms of performance 250 frames per second at 1080p feels really terrible for a 4090 going up to 1440p high settings hasn't lost us any performance and our 4090 still doing nothing nice okay there we go 300 frames per second at 10 0p medium settings again this is a very dumb way to run a game with this graphics card but we're finally getting a whole bunch of performance here and look at the CPU utilization we finally managed our goal of stressing that laptop chip now of course cyberpunk at 1080p low hasn't scaled wildly because CPU wasn't particularly happy even with the super neutered 490 uh but here 120 frames per second it feels good aside from that one big stutter but now let's see if we can max out our 4090 starting out with I don't know that nice we've lost about half our frame rate and look at the power draw which is getting into the Realms of 4090 so now let's bump it to 1440p and just like that we finally got the RTX 490 in its comfort zone drawing about as much power as the Ivory Coast and we're getting about the same frame rate we got with the igpu finnally enough uh although here the frame pacing is much better so I guess the takeaway from this video is to stuff your graphics card into the biggest hole you can find which brings me to the end of the video if you missed the first part where we initially check out the cybertruck Mini PC a suggestion for that video will pop up in a second if you enjoyed the video subscribe to the channel and until the next one bye-bye [Music] o [Music]",

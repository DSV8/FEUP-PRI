No matter how useful your team mate is... if he doesn't make money for the business... you have to let him go.  And that's what happened to Jack. He worked so hard! He did his job PERFECTLY... but he was not making any money for Apple specifically... so now hes gone. Probably for good.   This video explains why I personally think the headphone jack disappeared from the new Apple iPhone 7.   Here are a few links if you want to know more!  Why do you think that apple removed the headphone jack? Will you buy the iPhone 7 even though it doesn't have a headphone jack?

    "transcript": "The iPhone 7 headphone jack why is it really gone? Lets find out. [Intro] There are several reasons why Apple removed the headphone jack from the iPhone 7, and surprisingly #courage is not one of them. One of the main reasons why the headphone jack is gone is that the lightning port is propriety to Apple. Apple owns that jack. So any company making third party accessories for that lightning port have to pay Apple in order to use it. Its a direct revenue stream for Apple. So lets say as a third party manufacturer I want to design a new car charger, or a docking station, or a charging cable for the iPhone 7 using that lightning port. I get to pay Apple royalties for each cable that I make, even though Apple is not producing or manufacturing that cable just because its using their port. So how much does Apple make for each third party accessory sold? Its hard to say for sure. Wikipedia estimates at about 10%, but since Apple has NDA forms all over the place, once youre in the program and have signed all their forms, youre not allowed to talk about it or youll get sued. Some websites speculate that Apple has recently switched to a 4 dollar flat fee per cable because its easier to keep track of. Lucky for you guys, I am not in Apples MFi certification program and I have not signed any of their forms, but I have talked to several companies in China that manufacture MFi certified cables and they say that in order to get certified its 550 dollars per product. So lets say I have three different colors of lightning cables and each of those cables come in three different lengths. Now we have nine cables total and Im paying Apple almost 5,000 dollars to certify my cables for the public use. Remember that these numbers are not from Apple directly, theyre just from the manufacturer in China, so take that how you will. Now remember, I am not opposed to these fees, business is business. Apple designed their own port, Apple should get paid for anyone who decides to use their port. Thats how business works and Im okay with that. But, just for reference HDMI ports are also proprietary, and their royalty fee per cable can be as low as 5 cents. You can really tell what manufacturer wants you to use their product and which manufacturer doesnt. So Apple did not design the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack, so any accessory used with the iPhone -using that jack- Apple didnt make any money on. Now that they have effectively eliminated that headphone jack in the iPhone 7, each and every accessory that gets plugged into the iPhone 7, Apple gets paid for. Even if Apple doesnt design, manufacture or produce that accessory. Its an incredibly intelligent business decision. Apple does legally enforce their patents, as they should. I know someone who is selling non-MFi certified cables and they got sued by Apple and ended up paying over 5 figures as restitution. So, Apples money is rolling in from all directions. Now remember, I dont care that Apples protecting their design and their products and their investment and their information thats totally within their legal right and I approve. Its important to business to protect your assets. But its unfortunate that they had to remove a feature as useful as the headphone jack just because they werent making money on it. Apple saw a piece of the financial pie and they took it. The second reason Apple got rid of the headphone jack is because of waterproofing. Sealing off a 3.5 millimeter hole in the bottom of your phone is extremely expensive especially when youre manufacturing millions of them. Sealing that headphone jack internally would cost Apple a lot of money. Any why would they spend extra money on something they arent making any money with in the first place. Apples claim that they are dedicated to the wireless future is not valid. If they were truly dedicated to the wireless future they would have put wireless charging in their cellphones. Wireless charging has been built into cell phones for years now. The thing is, Apple wouldnt make money from that wireless chargingyet. Thats why they havent integrated it into their phones. They would be paying someone else royalties for that technology, and theyre not about that life. The argument that the headphone jack doesnt fit inside of the phone isnt valid either. The nice thing about designing your own phone, Apple, is that you get to decide what fits and what doesnt. So now that we know why the headphone jack is gone, lets talk about how it affects us as customers. Lets say youre on a road trip with your friends, anyone who owns an iPhone 7 wont be able to contribute to the aux cable music selection in the car unless you are carrying around your little dongle extender. If youve ever been to a state fair or know any entrepreneur, they wont be able to use the credit card reader like Square or PayPal for credit card transactions. If youve ever left your headphones at home while youre at the gym or traveling, theres no more buying a cheap pair of headphones with a headphone jackyoull need to buy a way more expensive proprietary, royalty fee included, pair of lightning headphones that Apple gets paid for, even if they werent made by Apple. But thats just what I think. Im curious as to what you think. Would you buy a phone without a headphone jack? Let me know down in the comments.

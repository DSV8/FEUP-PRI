    "transcript": "this abominable pile of turtle death is the largest collection of e-waste peripherals outside of an acer packing facility probably and what we're going to do in today's video is we're going to put them head to head to see how they stack up against each other and then we're gonna put them on a tier list but before we get into that it's time for a video sponsor for today's video today's video is sponsored by skillshare which is an online learning community which offers thousands of inspiring classes for creative people on topics like illustration design photography

this sounds good to you use the link in my description below to join skillshare the first thousand of my subscribers to click on the link will get a free trial of premium membership so that you can explore your creativity thank you skillshare for sponsoring today's video now before we have a look at the first keyboard just a quick disclaimer here i am not a reddit tier keyboard enthusiast so in this video we're not going to hear descriptions like hmm i feel like the short pre-travel matched with a low force requirement for bottoming out the keystroke leads to a mushy feeling typing experience similar to poking a phone in the belly after it consumed exactly 370 milliliters of teat milk but i'll still try and give you a solid indication of what the typing experience is like what it sounds like and the build quality and stuff like that i'm gonna start off by looking at the hp dell lenovo and acer keyboards because they're all pretty much the same it's kind of like choosing your favorite shape of genital wart like does it really matter when it comes to the typing experience they're all kind of same same but different uh let me play you some sound clips so you can get an indication of what each one sounds like and yes i do type like the keyboard owes me money i don't know typing on these keyboards makes you feel like an 80 year old sending your credit card details to an online scammer but you know it's perfectly usable build quality wise they're all very flexy terrible they're not really designed to bear weight in a bridge or whatever but i think they'll hold up well i think all of these e-waste peripherals are well known for never ever dying and that's why they make such good e-waste gaming wise i did use this and one of the issues that i have with all of these in fact is the placement of the the windows key and the alt here because of how far under your hand you have to go to hit alt you often end up hitting the windows key which if you're a mid gun fight in an fps game that's not ideal other than that yeah they're fine so with that let's have a look at something a bit more interesting we've got the msi keyboard now msi when it comes to their gaming prebuilts they make a big song and dance about how good their peripherals are that they include with them and while it shows with uh with the keyboard already there's still some flex but the actual keycaps are way better they're much higher profile this does have rgb as far as adjustability goes it does have feet but in the standard position it's okay when you bring the feet up this is a way better keyboard than the other four and i think it looks quite cool it looks like a like a decent gaming keyboard and then finally we have an i buy power keyboard which is also all gamery branded uh like the msi which is basically a polar opposite to the 60 year old accountant keyboards that we got with all of the other systems there are a couple of things that i really like about the i buy power keyboard the first one is the fact that it has a braided cable it's not a very nice braided cable but it is a braided cable that it comes with which none of the other keyboards have and then there is another thing that i like and it's the fact that it's got dedicated media keys up here they're not the most useful keys there's an internet explorer key for some reason and then the final thing is a volume wheel and this is something that you don't get on keyboards often these days which i'm sad about because i really like a good volume wheel it also has rgb i'll show it powered up so it does have that going for it the build quality is much worse than the msi one it's not a solid feeling especially it's like a noisy clacky typing experience that you have on your oh yeah the msi is is significantly better yeah i think that's a good time to move over to the mice one thing that you need to bear in mind while looking at these sets of peripherals they all come from gaming branded prebuilts that cost around the same amount of money now we're going to start off with the dell mouse which is just a mouse there's not much to say about the shape of it it does actually feel quite nice in the hand though the clicks aren't too bad and as far as i remember it's got one of the better sensors it's actually it's very sensitive but it doesn't step too much i don't know how well you can see this but some of the mice like they don't track accurately so there's like jumps in the movement so especially when you want to like make small movements it's really difficult to like accurately pin down what's going on uh although the dell one is okay it's it's not too bad uh let's actually move over to the i buy power one of course it has the the very necessary rgb on it it feels quite nice like ergonomically it's a decent mouse with a braided cable it's the only one with one of these although actually gaming with the i buy power one it's not great the sensor is very steppy and it does not feel very accurate especially at range i mean i did just i did just kill that guy it's also got some macro keys on the side so that's quite nice one of the things that i really dislike about this mouse though is the middle button the click on it doesn't work very well so in escape from talk of you use it to free look and the the button just doesn't activate the command very well but other than that it's basically like a gamer mouse ergonomic with a terrible e-waste sensor in it which actually on that note let's move over to the other gamer option the msi one now the msi mouse does become gross instantly like the moment that you just look at it it becomes disgusting but this mouse is actually good even by decent gaming mice standards it feels nice and the biggest difference between it and the other mice is the sensor in it like it's so much more smooth feeling it actually feels accurate when shooting at range it feels like you can you can actually hit targets which i'm gonna miss every shot here to illustrate my point yeah it feels so much better than the rest of them next we have this abomination which is the hp mouse one of the biggest issues with it is just the shape of the mouse because it's so flat it's really difficult to like grip and move around like you can't naturally hold this mouse but it's also got like a sharp edge on the sides so you it's just so difficult to hold this mouse properly i really really dislike this mask and finally the hp mouse also just has a terrible tracking sensor so it's it's just a horrible mouse all around now i have the lenovo mouse here the lenovo mouse feels much more comfortable than the hp one it's actually quite unfair for it to go from the hb to this one because anything will feel good compared to that the sensor is less sensitive than the hp one but you can clearly see the jutters here like you can see the mouse looking around movements aren't smooth uh it's because the sensor doesn't track properly honestly the only mouse in this roundup which the sensor can actually track decently is the msi one the rest of them have this like this stepped feel now finally we're moving over to the acer mouse which is tiny it's so little and that tiny size mixed with the feet on the bottom which are pretty much non-existent means that it doesn't grip very nicely and that mixed with the fact that the sensor on this mouse feels like it's on crack it is super sensitive and even when you drop the sensitivity in software it doesn't track very well it just feels unwieldy and terrible i really hate this little mouse now let's finally get to the tier list bit of the tier list video the whole reason we're all here now i'm going to get the obvious one out of the way first we all know that the msi set is just significantly better than the rest of them so it's going to go straight to s tier it is the only set of peripherals here that i wouldn't actually mind using daily even while not threatened at gunpoint so that's pretty cool and compared to the other e-waste peripherals it could just as well have been hewn out of mithril by tahitian virgins for thor's gaming setup like it's just so much better it's so much better in fact that i'm not gonna put anything in eight here because we need to we need to differentiate them in fact i'm not even gonna put anything in beat here so that we can just properly emphasize how much better it is than the rest of them now when it comes to seat here i'm going to start off by putting the dowel set here as far as all of the oem peripherals goes i think the dowel set is definitely a bit better than them there isn't a glaring issue with the ergonomics of the mouse or the sensor and the keyboard isn't the worst either so i think it's a solid seat here now in terms of the i buy power peripheral set i did toy with the idea of putting it in b tier because i feel like it's got more features than the dowel peripheral set but there are a couple of things that mouse first off is really terrible and secondly i feel like they just tried to hide a terrible oem peripheral set in a stupid gamer aesthetic so yeah that just kind of annoys me so just for that we're gonna put it in c tier along with the dell peripheral set next up we're moving down to the d tier which as we all know stands for dumbass tier which is why i think the lenovo set really deserves to be here considering that dumbass keyboard layout i don't know why i hate it so much because it's not like it actually impacts the usability of the keyboard that much but for some reason that irritates me and the sensor in the mouse is a definite step down from the dowel mouse even though the ergonomics in it isn't that bad so i think that it makes a solid addition to the d tier next up we're moving down to the e tier which as we all know stands for the ebola tier for peripherals that make you physically ill now i'm definitely going to put the acer setup here it's keyboard offered one of the least pleasant typing experiences and that matched with the tiny little cracked out mouse means that it's just a horrible experience using that setup which brings me to the final and probably my most disliked set of peripherals which is from acer i mean hp now i'm not quite sure if i want to just also put it in e tier or take it all the way down to f because as far as the keyboard goes it's very similar to the one from acer but the mouse takes it one step further it doesn't just disappear in your hand because of the sharp angles on it it also tries to maim you permanently while using it so i think because of that we need to drop it all the way down to ftm and that brings me to the end of an admittedly quite anemic tier list but considering the fact that you have to buy an entire pre-built per set of e-waste peripherals i feel like six is quite extensive actually and you know it's quite a broad spectrum of e-waste peripherals if you liked the video please do like and subscribe to the channel for more videos like this one let me know down in the comment section below if you agree with my tier list or if you're wrong and uh yeah until the next video thank you for watching bye you",

    "transcript": "(electronic music) - You are looking at Dolby's first consumer product. The new $599 Dolby Dimension headphones. Now these are high end wireless headphones but they're a little different than the wireless headphones you're probably familiar with. See, instead of being designed to be worn on the go, when you're commuting, or maybe on a plane, these wireless headphones are meant to be used in your home. They're kinda like those old headphones your grandparents might have had plugged into their TV so they could listen to their shows as loud as they want without disturbing everyone in the house, but these are new, modern headphones so they have a bunch of new tricks that make them a bit more interesting than those old headphones. Now for starters, the Dimension use Bluetooth to connect to your devices, and you could save up to eight pairings at a time. You can also program three devices to the buttons on the side of the right ear cup to quickly switch between them. I've got this one programmed to my phone, this one to by tablet, and this one to my computer here, and since these are a Dolby product, the Dimensions have lots of audio processing and enhancement features. The company says if you listen to content that's been created and mixed for Atmos, you'll get the best sound for it you can over Bluetooth when you're wearing these headphones. (alternative music) And they sound really good, they have a wide presence and a broad sound stage, and really crisp details. Now Dolby won't say that they are tuned for any specific activity, but it's clear from my testing that these are really meant to be worn when you're watching a movie with lots of sound effects and things going on. They don't necessarily sound bad for music, it's just a little less impressive then when you're using them as a home theater. And then they also have a new feature that's meant to make them easier to use when you're wearing them in a home with other people. Now, many over ear wireless headphones have active noise cancellation features, which use microphones on the outside of the ear cup to cancel out noises and cocoon you in silence, and that's why everyone loves to wear them on airplanes, but the Dimensions do the opposite. They use microphones on the ear cup to mix in the sounds of your environment with what ever audio you're playing in the headphones. That means you can still hear if someone talks to you or a baby cries or the doorbell rings when you're wearing these. It's almost like an inverted noise cancellation feature. Now the company calls this LIFEMIX and you can adjust the levels of the mix with the mobile app. If you wanna completely block out all external sound and then use them as noise canceling headphones, you can do that, or you can crank up the outside audio so you hear more of that than whatever you're listening to. So to test this, we're using these binaural microphones. I'm gonna put the headphones on them here, then we'll play music through the headphones, and I'm gonna play something on my laptop and I'll use the app here to adjust the mix and see how it sounds different. Let's fire up something to the headphones. Asphalt burning in the atmosphere - [Female Voice] So all of you have told me. Can't see the sun but you know it's there - [Female Voice] Yeah it's true. Buffaloes kicking up the dust again and oh (indistinct female chatter) People getting cool I'm taken by the tide - [Female Voice] As a professional travel player for Apex. They make you feel like it was suicide They made you feel like it was do or die But no, oh no The way you push then pull me - [Female Voice] And you give yourself the option It's made your journey longer It's still to sacrifice your life oh (pop music) - Now the idea here is that if you're at home and your partner wants to watch something on TV and you wanna watch something different on your tablet, you can both be in the same room together, enjoying each others own content, yet still be able to have a conversation without having to raise your voice or take your headphones off. Or maybe it's late a night and you're watching a movie on your big flat panel TV and you don't wanna wake the kids. The Dimensions let you watch the movie without having to use Closed Captions and still be able to hear if someone gets out of bed when they're not supposed to. There's some other neat things too. Like a head tracking feature that'll automatically position the sound source right in front of you and keep it there whenever you turn your head. Just like if you were listening to a real speaker. So to test the head tracking feature, I've got them back on these binaural microphones. I'm gonna play some music and then I'm just gonna turn the microphones to see if they can hear any difference. Ever thought that you could be Caught up like a bullet in the breeze As for headphone features, these hare high end. They've got metal frames, buttery soft faux leather covers, and these really plush ear cups and a padded head band for comfort. For my head, they're really comfortable to wear even if I'm binging an entire Netflix show for 10 hours straight. Dolby says that they will last up to 10 hours with all of the head tracking and sound enhancement features enabled, or up to 16 hours if you turn those features off. They come with this neat little magnetic dock that charges them up so they're ready to go whenever you pick them up, or you can use a standard micro USB cable if you don't have that handy. The Dimensions also have most other wireless headphone things, they've got swipe controls for volume and play back on the ear cup, support for calls when they're connected to your phone, and the ability to launch Siri or Google Assistant with a long press. But what you'll notice is they don't fold up conveniently and they don't have a 3.5 millimeter headphone cable so you can't use them with in flight entertainment, and they really aren't great for travel or on the go. They're really designed to be worn and used in your home. And for me, that's a little strange. I wear headphones all the time on my commute or at the office, but when I'm at home, I almost never wear them because it's more comfortable to listen to things on my Sonos or from my TV sound bar. Plus, when I have headphones on, I am isolated from the rest of my family, which feels a bit rude. The Dimensions do alleviate this somewhat, instead of being completely isolated, I can still hear if my kids ask me something or my spouse talks to me, but they're still headphones and there are social norms in place that say when I have headphones on, I'm probably not listening to you. The Dimensions don't quite overcome that, even if I can hear everything my wife is saying when I wear them. Now I do think that they are useful for parents of young children that don't wanna watch TV or movies through closed captions, but still wanna be able to hear if the baby is crying or someone gets up. If that's you, then you'll probably love these things but I'm more interested in where Dolby takes this next. Maybe in a more portable pair that can travel with me easier and go the places that I actually do wear headphones all the time. Maybe then I'll be interested in spending 600 bucks. Thanks for watching. These are kind of like a new different thing and I'm curious, is this something that you would buy? Would you buy headphones that you really can't use outside of the house?

    "transcript": "So I run a YouTube channel called Jerry Rig Everything. Most people assume that my name is Jerry, but its not. Its Zack. Jerry, my grandpa, built this cabin right here. And this cabin right here has a 20 year old mouse problemnot that the mouse is 20 years old, but the mice have been there for 20 years. Jerry was really good at jerry-rigging things and he didnt always use the most kosher construction practices. So this cabin has a lot of reclaimed wood in it, and the mouse problem could be relatively small but its probably going to be pretty big. The mice have been in there for a very long time and they are very comfortable. But this week we set it aside and we are going to vanquish this mouse problem. So if youre squeamish about dead animals or dirty places, this probably wont be the video you want to watch. I hope were successful because this cabins pretty awesome. [Music] Im in the bathroom right now. We just removed the toilet. We have some holes here in the corner where the mice have been getting in. And then right here you can see a bunch of dirt and grass and stuff where theyve been coming through the drywall. Took out the toilet and stuck it in the shower. Then on this side we have some more holes in the wall where the mice have been getting in. So were going to have to rip out this wall and see what the damage is inside of there as well. Lets get started. Wearing our proper safety gear. Were going to lift out the carpet all around this bottom area. When we were lifting up the carpet we got the dead remains of a mouse right here. It died between the cement and the front padding, probably getting out of that hole or something. We got mouse fur and mouse guts all up inside of this cabinet. And we got mouse poop everywhere else. Alright weve taken out the wall behind the toilet and this is what we found. Right here, this cute little guy lived its last moments. If we follow right here to this pipe we have a whole nest. So theyre coming up where the pipe comes into the house. Cuz it doesnt look like theres anything behind this; just right here. Now we know. Got this piece out by the shower here. So there should be insulation all the way through here but theyve just kind of carried it out. Theres no insulation. Theres supposed to be insulation right? (Eric) Yes, and theyve eaten it. Theyve eaten it all and theyre coming in back there. (Zack) Is this is outside wall? (Eric) Yes. (Zack) Cuz weve got plants growing up in here. So what were thinking right now, so this is the shower, were thinking that theyre coming up through the drain right here and then going into this part of the wall and eating away the insulation. But we also went up here to the top side of the shower and right here you can see that theres mouse crap everywhere and we can see that theyre going up into the ceiling a little bitProbably through that little hole right there, cuz the drywall would have been pretty tight up against those boards. But that holes the perfect size for a mouse Id think. Well find out after we get the shower out of here. Well, the top parts good. So we got the shower out and we found out where all the mice were getting in. Theyre right down here. The foundation is pretty much gone. So theyre either coming up from the drain or most likely theyre coming in from the outside over there. And theyre making their little homes in here. Looks like theyve eaten out all of the insulation over here on this side all the way up. Theyve eaten the insulation here. And theyre going up into the ceiling. See all those little black dots? Those are NOT supposed to be there. [Music] So this is a mouse hotel. The mouse will go in because theres bait inside. So they go in through this hole and then get stuck inside of the hotel. Weve had a little mouse problem the last couple years. We can see the problem is that there is an actual literal gap in the framing where you can see outside. Thats where all the mice are getting in. So well probably need steel wool for that. (Eric) Uh huh. Or mouse wire. (Zack) Mouse wire. Then we got the leak up in the ceiling we got to worry about. [Music] So weve made quite a bit of progress. We have the wall ripped out on this far side to see where the mice are coming in. And its basically just one hole way out there in the corner. Ill show you the outside of the house in just a second. But up here we can see where the waters coming in. So we have thefor the chimney theres like four inches above that metal box where the water is coming in. And then its running down that left joist all the way down. And thats where you saw the big water mark over the drywall right here. So pulling off the drywall was difficult cuz we didnt know what direction they were going to run. But patching it should be relatively easy once we get joist or a stud in a straight line and then we can just put the drywall into place. So now well assess the damages and see what we want to do with it. [Music] So the reason were wearing these masks is because one, the mouse poop, but two, this fiberglass insulation right here. This pink stuff isnt good to breathe in. And theres also a bunch of mold and stuff from the water damage in the other room. So were making sure were not breathing in any harmful chemicals. Youll want to wear gloves as well because the pink stuff, the fiberglass, can get into your skin and its really irritating. So weve cleaned out the drywall and the insulation from behind the shower and it looks like the biggest mouse problem is right here in the concrete. So when my grandpa built this, from day one they decided to add another drain to it. So this drain, this hole in the floor, has been in here since day number one. And you can see out in that far corner theres even daylight coming through that hole. So the mice have had an open passageway this whole time. What were going to do right now is were going to clean out all the dirt from right here, level it out, and stick new concrete and fill this hole up. [Music] For this part basically Im just smoothing it out and shaking it a little bit to get it up inside the cracks and to get the bigger rocks down at the bottom. And that will give us a smooth surface on top when we finally get this other layer on topget the second bag on. [Music] Heres where we did the cement part of it. So over here in the corner we can see a little hole where the mice have been coming in. So lucky for us, were going to put some steel wool around the outside, some wire grate. But mice dont like to eat steel wool for obvious reasons. Its made of metal. So were going to put some silicone caulk all around the inside and stuff it with steel wool, and then put some steel wool around the outside wood as well. So the steel wool from the outside is going to be mostly protecting, but the steel wool on the inside is going to make sure that nothing else comes through this hole. And well staple it down as well to make sure that no Hercules mice can slip through. Alright so we have the steel wool in there and a bunch of silicone caulk thats kind of holding it in place. So here on the edge of the house you can see a little bit of a hole right here. And on the inside that goes into the cabin. So we need to put a bunch of steel wool and stuff in here and caulk that up. So this is the inside of the hole we just previously looked at from the outside. So Im going to fill that up with steel wool and silicone caulk and hope for the best. Alright now we got the whole crack filled with steel wool. Silicone caulk down in there and I can spread it around and put it over the steel wool. The nice thing about silicone is that it helps it, once its all dried, it will help it stay in place, and its not very tasty. The mice wont eat it. But these are the same mice who eat fiberglass insulation, so they might like it, I dont even know. So heres our precarious ladder situation going up to the roof. Once I get up there Ill take a look and analyze and see where the water is coming in through the chimney. Ok so Im up here now. We can see that people have tried to fix this already, but it looks like they used some inferior caulk. So when this gets really hot in the summer it shrivels up. So you can see right around here, this nail, all the caulk has shriveled up and its gone. Its not waterproof anymore. Then we got this section. So all the caulk right here is shriveled up and its just not working at all anymore. So Im hoping thats the issue. Im going to pull off all of this dead stuff and then well put some new, high temperature rated caulk on top of it. But Im hoping that this sealer, the Ultimate Sealer, is going to hold it a little bit better. Its rated at 300 degrees and that should be enough temperature-wise. I dont think this roof will get much hotter than that. So now Im just going to smooth it out and make sure that these joints right herecuz when the water runs down these channels its going to go right there underneath and then down the chimney. So as long as Ive done this excessively, we shouldnt have any issues. And Ill make sure to keep these channels pretty deep. That is some thick stuff. Alright so we have a ridiculous amount of caulk on there right now. Hopefully that will keep it water tight. Its not a professional job but were just here to jerry-rig the thing. That should keep all the snow and water out of there. So I just moved this wood box away from this wall over here and theres a whole dead bird right up against the wall. Just kind of like disintegrated itself. Pretty feathers though. We should probably use this cabin more often. I remember when I was a little kid working with my grandpa to make this ladder. We would cut out the holes right here. And I had no idea what he was making at the time because it just didnt make sense to me when it was laying on the ground. But then when we came and installed it here for the loft, it turned out pretty well. [Music] So heres another creative mouse trap. So this one the mice crawl up the little wooden plank, and then on the soda can there are two little Xs that you put peanut butter on. So the mice will jump onto the peanut butter and the can will spin and they will fall in and die. You can put water in the bottom so that theyll drown or you can just leave them in there and theyll be caught. [Music] So were onto the drywall right now. This is one of the test walls we cut to make sure there are no mice living in this wall. And this side of the house is pretty fine. So I went through and I measured this. And I cut out to this other stud two so there are two points of attachment on either side. And then heres a piece of drywall. So drywall has like a little bit of a tapper on one end. So its like slightly thicker here and then a little bit less thick here. And youd want to use this tapper whenever possible because it makes the mudding easier which youll see in just a second. Cutting drywall is actually extremely easy. So I have this knife right here that Im going to do with the short side. And that just cuts through very easily all the way through. Its very serrated. And on this long side Im going to use my razor blade to score the paper all along this bottom edge and then just snap it off and it will cut that cleanly. You want to score the side thats going to be facing the room because the back side, this brown paper, is going to tear a little bit. So lets give it a shot and then well just pop the puzzle piece into the hole that we cut and well go from there. One thing my grandpa taught me is to use the whole length of the saw blade. So when youre cutting through it, let the saw do the work instead of you do the work. Tools. Its what theyre made for. So since this hole was cut kind of skiwampus in the first place when we were doing the patch job, I just scored it one more time and cut it to length. And you can just, since its scored, the paper will just break off without actually damaging the part thats going to be visible. Cuz if you have a bunch of frayed paper its going to be a lot harder to put the mud on and paint later. So now we have the unfinished, unpainted drywall in place. Little gaps like this arent a big deal and Ill show you why in just a second as we mud it cuz thats going to be all covered up. When youre doing this, try to hit as many studs as possible. So theres a stud here and a stud here and so this is going to be pretty solid. So if this was a new house wed be using the normal drywall tape that just sits over the top of this and is a lot smoother. But since this is a patch job were using this kind of drywall tape. Basically it sits over the crack and lets the drywall mud seep through into the crack, filling the hole, and then making it smoother overall. This holds the mud in place a little bit better. Alright so the first coat of mud is on. Right now its mostly just filling in all the gaps on the uneven ledge between the one piece and the other piece. And so you can still see the tape a little bit, but when I go back through and sand these ridges and then put one more coat of mud over the top of it, it will hide the tape completely and then well be able to blend it in more when we paint the whole wall. So well let this dry. You can see this part right here is drying. And when it all turns white, were ready to sand it and then put on that second coat. So heres a furry little mouse friend making his little bed up here in the insulation. Get rid of his body. So one of the entry points for the mice is right in-between the foundation layer and then the wood right on top of it, theres a little bit of a gap there. So what weve taken is we have some wire grate that has one fourth inch holes in it that mice cant fit through. And weve taken some adhesive and adhesived it to the cement and weve stapled it into the wood. So now that gap is off limits to the mice. So were three days into it and we think that we have everything figured out and solidified and we come around to the back of the house as were wrapping that metal grate around it and this is what we find. We have the side of the house over there and we have the highway of mice going inside of the house. So it looks like a nest right there and it looks like it goes farther over there as well. Dang. So what we realized is that this whole cabin has been made out of reclaimed wood. So when my grandpa put this plywood in, it already had a hole nibbled out by mice. And then the mice here at this cabin made it bigger. So he knew that hole was there so he stuck this piece of wood to block it, but the mice just went around it. Same thing with this board down here. So, thats where were at. Instead of ripping out all the interior walls to find the nest and pull out the insulation, were just going to cut a foot out from the bottom of these pieces of plywood because these are the pre-mouse nibbled pieces of plywood that my grandpa put down. And then well take a new piece of plywood, put it in its place, put the mesh over the top of it, and that should be good after weve cleaned it all out from the outside. So right now Im going to cut a piece of insulation for this hole right here. Its about a foot and nine inches. The trick with insulation is that it has to be fully expanded to do the insulating. So you have to get the right dimensions for it. So this is a 6 inch stud right here. And when you install it you have to make sure that its all fluffed out. And when you cut it, if you step on it and make it flat, you can cut it pretty easily all the way through the insulation at one time. And the R-21 gives it its insulation value; how well it is at retaining heat. So now Im going to cut it and we will install it. [Music] This is one of the carpets that we have up in the loft. It has like just a bunch of little games on it. So you have like Chinese checkers, you have regular checkers, you have hop scotch, you have all kinds of gamestic tac toe. This is just up there for all the kids to play withall the grandkids. Right now its out here in the sun. Hopefully the sun will kill all of the bacteria and stuff on it and we can keep using it. So Im doing all the taping behind the stove. All the tape is up now. Im going to start the mudding process. And over here, my uncle has this all taped off and dry walled. This is from the hole on the other side that we discovered underneath the plywood on the exterior. Then down in this room, this is where I have that first wall mudded off. So its just one layer right now. We still got to sand it down and refinish it and make it look a little bit more seamless. Then in here is the bathroom where we did the cement. Plugged up that hole and this hole. This has a bunch of caulk and steel wool in it, and that should keep anything from coming up. And that is our view. This is an old 36 caliber scavenger. It was likely used in the Civil War and was found in a privy behind a bar. So its day number three. Pretty good day. We finished a lot of the dry wall and the plugging of the house. We sealed the bottom of it with that steel mesh. The worst part of the day was when we found the big holes in the back. But it turned out not to be as big of a deal as we thought it was. Yeah, we still had to seal them, but the holes were already there from the wood that my grandpa brought back from his car wash. So he reclaimed the wood and reused it. So the holes were already there. The mice just made them a little bit bigger but they didnt explore into the house. They just used that area in-between the walls. So it wasnt too bad. We took out the plywood, put the new plywood in, and then put a lot of the wire mesh over the top of that. So were pretty confident that theyre not going to get in. Hopefully we only have one more day of this. All that we have to do is finish the second coat of mud kind of expanded out so the seams arent as noticeable. And then well paint it probably in the spring once we verify and make sure that there are no mouse problems anymore. So cross all your fingers. [Music] So its day four. We finally have all the carpet out of all the rooms and we are doing the finishing touches on the drywall. So this is some drywall that I just finished. You can see how the second coat is a lot wider than the first coat. So the first coat was mostly just to fill it up. Then you sand it all down. Then you do a wider coat. So theres still like a little ridge right here if you can see it. But well sand that down before we do the final painting. Drywall mud is really easy to sand. Before we put everything back together were going to make sure that the mice are completely sealed out. So were going to leave everything for the fall and the winter because thats usually when the mice come in. And then next spring, if there are only like one or two mice, well paint everything and make it all like a nice little cabin again. But if there are a hundred mice, or two hundred mice, then we will assess other options. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang My cousins mowing the lawnhes going to be out there a while. So were pretty much done with the cabin. This is the middle of day four, so we pretty much worked four days on it. Day three we had some family members come out and help out with the construction process and that helped out a ton. Couldnt have done it without them. But I think Jerry will be proud of what weve done, you know a couple things are jerry-rigged but thats how he would like it. So well wait around till next spring and see how bad the mouse problem is then. Hopefully only one or two get inside. I mean, were in the middle of nowhere so we cant expect the impossible. Thanks so much for joining us with this project. Its a little bit different than what we normally do on this channel, but I had a lot of fun and I think Jerry would be proud of what weve accomplished. Hope to see you around!",

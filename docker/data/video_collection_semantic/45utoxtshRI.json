    "transcript": "- This is a receipt for an HP Stream that I purchased back in 2014, and it really got me thinking, why is this laptop still being sold in 2024? Now the backstory is actually kind of interesting. These were a class of what Windows calls Cloudbooks that were released in 2013, 2014, really as a competition to Chromebooks. At the time, Microsoft was terrified of Google absolutely destroying the low end of the Windows ecosystem and getting everyone on Google Docs and Drive instead of selling them OneDrive subscriptions or Microsoft Word. And so what they did was they absolutely copy and pasted the idea of a Chromebook and slapped Windows on it. So these would be incredibly low-end pieces of hardware with terrible screens, almost no specs to speak of. But importantly, they did run full versions of Windows. And I'll be honest, the first version of the HP Stream was actually not bad. I remember I did a video on it, and while certainly wasn't perfect, ChromeOS was also far from as full-featured as it is today, which meant that running a full version of Windows for 200 bucks was actually a pretty good deal. But fast forward to today in 2024 and the HP Stream, while it's seen some minor updates, is still being sold exactly as it was 10 years ago. So today I wanna find out why is one of the, at this point, worst laptops you could possibly buy, still not only being sold, but still actually popular? And so I have myself the HP 14 laptop. It's so generic, it doesn't even get a name anymore. Now I purchased this laptop for $180, which doesn't seem too bad, but it was not the cheapest laptop there. Not only were there a number of Chromebooks cheaper, but also there were a number of Windows laptops that were even cheaper than this. Let's take it back and spend a little bit of time with our good old buddy, the HP, not Stream anymore, just laptop, doesn't even get a name. And so it is time to take a look at our beautiful new HP laptop. Now I've already spotted a pretty major problem. This is not even the newest version of the laptop. Right there on the screenshot, it says 2021, which is less than ideal when I'm trying to look at the new one. But this is still being sold at Best Buys. And I'll tell you, it is certainly not just Best Buys. These things are everywhere. You can find them at Walmarts, you can find them at Targets. I mean, it is unbelievable how many of these laptops that HP must have sold over the last decade. So let's take a look, before we get into it, let me read you these beautiful, beautiful specs. Intel Celeron Processor N4120. That's a dual, it's either one of the dual or the quad core ones, but regardless, not good. 64 gigabytes of eMMC storage. So smaller than a hard drive, and about as fast. Four gigabytes of RAM. Yep, I bought a new laptop in 2024 with four gigabytes of RAM. It does come with Windows 11, but in S mode, I'll explain that in a little bit. It's a quirky, weird thing that they try to put on some of their lower end laptops. I think it's to do with licensing because even though it's annoying, it basically means that you can't run any app that's outside the Windows Store. It takes you all of seven seconds to turn that off. So it doesn't really matter. And this is using a, oh, I love this, 14 inch HD LED display, 220 nits. Okay, so when you hear 14 inch LED display, that sounds reasonable, right? The HD part is technically true, but I think a little bit of a stretch because this, my friends, is a 14 inch 1366 x 768 display. You know the resolution that your Windows Vista laptop had. I can't, like oh God. Because they say what? They say LED, not LCD, not IPS, no no no, just LED. It also is outfitted with a 41 watt hour battery. And interestingly, Microsoft 365, now that is actually one of the advantages of buying a system like this. It actually does come with, at least last time I tried, a full year of Microsoft 365, which is I think worth like 80 bucks or something. Now this is I think a legacy of this being sort of designed to go head to head with Chromebooks, which of course come with Google Docs as does every Google account ever. Microsoft really wants people who buy these super cheap laptops to get ingrained into the Microsoft ecosystem. It even comes with a one month trial of Xbox Game Pass. I'm not gonna try that. That's not gonna work. Not looking forward to this. Now, I do believe this does have USB-C, although it ships with a barrel connector for charging, and then we've got ourselves our HP laptop. They might just call it the laptop. I'm gonna call it the Stream. I'll say the packaging has evolved since the last time I looked at one of these. It's actually kind of nice. Well, it's cardboard. I know this is gonna be bad. There's no question about that. My bigger question is why on earth is this still sold in 2024? I get it I guess, why it's still being purchased, right? Like I understand from a lot of consumer's perspective, you want a cheap laptop for school or second device or whatever, and you walk in and HP is a reputable brand. Why not spend $180 on it? I mean, there's a reason why these things have been on Best Buy end caps for a decade now, but there are better options. First of all, the used market is great, but also there are other laptops in this $200 price point, right? Like I would, if I'm being honest with you, probably take a Chromebook, which might have like at least a better display and better Wifi and whatnot. I don't want use it, I don't want to use it. I don't want, bleh, I don't want to use it. Let's just open it up and see. (dramatic music) All right, that is plastic, my friends. It's light enough I guess. I think it's a fan-less design. I'm actually not entirely sure. It's got this almost kind of this sort of pearlescent kind of finish. I will say it does without any hesitation, have a good selection of ports. So we got ourselves a headphone jack, a USB-C, two USB 3.0, an HDMI, the power port. And on the other side you have weirdly a full-size SD card, which is actually kind of nice because a lot of laptops are either completely dropping the SD card slot or at least have like a microSD or something. I'm gonna do the flex test, okay? Just listen. (laptop clunking) It only did it the one time. Did you hear that clunk? Okay, it's not doing it anymore. I mean, there is an obscene amount of flex. Well, there's nothing else for it. Let me fire this guy up and live the HP Stream life. I know it's not gonna be good, but like is it usable at all? Mm, okay, all right. After spending a few days using the HP laptop, oh boy, let me tell you, this has been quite the experience. Now if you've watched the channel in the past, you'll know that every couple of years, I make a video on the HP Stream because it is so weird. I mean, can you name another piece of tech that's gone essentially unchanged for 10 years? It's like the Stream exists in its own weird like time capsule of complete garbage town. So where do we even start with what's wrong with it? Let's start with the specs. So the model I have here is powered by an Intel Celeron N4120. Now this chip was released back in 2019, and even then it was incredibly slow. Now yes, if you keep yourself limited to just a couple of tabs and literally nothing else, it's fine. But it is 2024. And the fact that my music in Spotify, which mind you is not in the app, it's actually in a browser tab, it stutters sometimes when I open up a second tab should tell you the level of performance that we're working with here. Pair that anemic processor with only four gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigabytes of slow eMMC storage, you've got yourself a recipe for disaster. Now the advantages of running a real OS like Windows 11, well they're pretty much nonexistent when your hardware can barely keep up with opening a couple of browser tabs. At this point, you can easily find Chromebooks that I'm gonna argue are straight up better. ChromeOS is better optimized for lighter tasks and it has a wider selection of hardware, including ARM-based processors that are gonna be a straight up improvement over the ancient Intel silicon the HP uses in the Stream. On top of that, most Chromebooks have other features like better Wifi and touchscreens. And actually, speaking of touchscreens, don't get me started on the screen. Sorry, hang on. Let me just pause for a second. The longer I go here, the more angry I'm gonna get. But I'm gonna try to be reasonable. I'm gonna try to be calm and give you my honest opinion why the HP Stream is quite possibly the worst device ever. Said the same thing year after year and they keep making it, it's not any better, and people keep buying it. So the screen, we're talking about a 1366 x 768 resolution on a 14 inch panel. Not only is that incredibly low res by today's standards, but it's also just not even a good panel. It's washed out with terrible color and contrast. It's like staring at a basic laptop screen from 2010. Oh wait, it is. Now to put things into perspective, this is the CMF Phone 1. Now it is a $200 smartphone, and this, at the same price of the HP Stream, has specs that absolutely run rings around it. We're talking about a beautiful 120 hertz HD OLED display, a processor that is way, way faster than the Celeron in the Stream. I mean, the fact that this exists at $200. So why does it still exist? Well, I've got a few theories. First, HP likely pays little to nothing for both the Windows license as well as the Intel CPU. Now even at a sub $200 price point, they're probably turning a profit on each unit sold. It's a volume game and you're probably more likely to buy a better HP afterward because either the HP Stream is going to die on you or you throw it at a wall because you're so frustrated with it and need an upgrade anyway. Secondly, retailers like having a reliable $200-ish laptop on sale pretty much year round because there's a never ending supply of parents who will walk in looking for a basic cheap laptop for little Timmy. Ah, pip pip cheerio, good sir. Would you like an HP Stream? Woo-hoo! But here's the thing. This is not, for literally anyone on earth, an acceptable answer. We should not be settling for what is an objectively terrible device just because it's cheap. Five seconds of searching on Best Buy will deliver this Lenovo Ideapad, which is probably an order of magnitude more powerful and useful than the Stream for just $100 more. Same thing goes for this Acer Chromebook Plus. Now look, I completely understand, an extra hundred dollars is a lot of money for many people, but believe me, it's worth it. Not too long ago, we actually looked at some of the cheapest laptops on Amazon. And even though some of these were from less than reputable brands, they were all still a hell of a lot better than this. You know, I feel like I make a lot of videos on bad stuff and usually there's like some kind of redeeming sort of feature. I'm like, oh, you know, if the price is right, the price would only be right for an HP Stream if it was $99. Even a used $200 MacBook from a few years ago is likely to be a much, much more usable system than a brand new HP Stream. You're getting a better screen, a more capable processor, an operating system that doesn't fall apart when you try to do two things at once. In today's world, having access to a functional computer is really important. I mean, smartphones are great, but sometimes you need a full copy of Windows and a physical keyboard. Now when companies sell laptops like the HP Stream, they're essentially selling you the illusion of access. Now sure you have a computer, but can you actually use it effectively for online classes? Can you run the software you need for work? Can you even browse the web without wanting to throw the thing out the window? In a lot of ways, it reminds me of the early days of netbooks. Remember those tiny little laptops that were all the rage in the late 2000s? They promised portable computing at a low price. And while I have a lot of nostalgia for them, I gotta admit most of them were deeply flawed devices. The difference though is that netbooks were clearly a stepping stone to better technology. Now I know, I know, some of you might be thinking, \"But Austin, not everyone needs a powerful computer. Some people just wanna check their email and watch the Austin Evans YouTube channel and subscribe and ringaling the dingling button.\" And here's the thing, you're right, but even those basic tasks are becoming more demanding. Websites are more complex, apps require more resources, and our expectations for what a computer should be able to do have increased. So look, what's the takeaway here? If you are in the market for the cheapest laptop possible, do not fall for the HP Stream or its competitors. And to the manufacturers out there, it's time to stop. I understand there's a need for budget options, but in my opinion, there's a difference between budget and barely functional. Now I completely understand that HP is not the only company making these cheap, terrible laptops. Both ASUS and Lenovo are a couple of other companies who have very similar options. But seriously, it's time we demand more. I do not want to have to make another HP Stream video in 2026. But I will if I have to.",

    "transcript": "in the previous episode of David's Sloan inevitable cruel to insanity this doesn't seem to be working so none of the ram that I have will work in this motherboard oh it still doesn't work oh no oh but it still doesn't work how is this piece of crap still not posting [Music] now it's been about two weeks since I posted that video evidence of my torture my epic system and since then you have posted hundreds of comments with suggestions on how to get that pain in the ass running so in today's video I'm going to implement those suggestions and get that bastard running once and for all and because this video is very kindly sponsored by be quiet to help me recoup all the money I spent on ECC Ram we're then gonna take that system and build it into a monolithic new be quiet case that's designed to accommodate any load and then finally we'll test it in the most cursed single Channel configuration the world has ever seen so buckle your panties because it's gonna be one hell of a ride [Music] thank you now the first suggestion we're going to try which was by far the most popular a whole bunch of you posted it was that I didn't Mount the Epic CPU with enough pressure apparently when you buy an epic CPU you're supposed to get a torque wrench included set to the correct pressure but because I bought these two CPUs used off of eBay I didn't get that wrench included so I had to go and buy one so on your recommendation I got a torque wrench and this one has an accuracy of plus minus two percent ooh very fancy I I think I don't know [Music] oh it doesn't come with the correct bit or does it is this this well let's let's try these oh yes it does like a glove very good okay now I have no idea how this works I guess you just oh there we go we just have to scale it back to 1.5 newton meters yeah there we go this feels weird but let's let's give it a try okay that's some positive feedback I feel like that's the exact same typist like last time I just tightened it until it stopped tightening which is what happened this time like I don't know let's double check yeah there we go it's fine and after very professionally double checking bolt tightness it was time for step two now according to the seller this is golden crusted ECC Ram forged in Mount Olympus that'll definitely work on this system so let's give it a try [Music] and here's me plugging in those beautiful sleeved be quiet power supply cables okay so this like super should post so let's oh things are spinning up that's very promising that's like similar to where we were last time and those two LEDs are doing the manual mandated dance a few moments later but it's still not posting so despite the correct mounting pressure and the Zeus Ram it still wouldn't post but then after a whole bunch of fiddling for no particular reason I decided to move the graphics card from the full sized pcie slot to the top half one [Music] oh oh the thing look a thing happened oh finally got a signal out of the thing I'm almost certain it's because we're using the awesome be quiet dark Power Pro 13 power supply I mean putting aside the whole Intel boot agent thing which feels very weird to me but look at that it's it's asking for media and like it's video has come out so the next step is to drop the second CPU in here with its own stick of RAM and see if we get a signal out with that configuration [Music] oh look at that that's so exciting it means that we can actually game using the world's worst single Channel setup I think just one of eight channels actually on that note I do want to test to see if the ram that I bought off of Amazon works in the systems that I don't have to order a whole bunch more from the eBay seller because you know I I have this Ram at hand I don't have to wait a bunch of time for it to come oh it does work so what I'm gonna do next is test the final configuration that I'm gonna build into the beautiful Majestic dark Bass Pro 901 but after spending eight years plugging in the 16 sticks of RAM and dropping in the AMD graphics card I wanted to use with the system I ran into another problem wait pcie vendor and device ID do not match oh it's not happy with that graphics card and Not only was the only graphics card I tried that didn't give me that vendor mismatch warnings the GTX 1650i started with but the motherboard also wouldn't let me into its bios I spent ages feverishly smacking every key I knew to invoke a bios on every system I've ever used to no avail which brings me to comment suggestion number two one of the three Lan ports on the motherboard supports what's called ipmi which is bios over Network as far as I understand it which unfortunately didn't work because I didn't know what the motherboard's IP address was and the default one that super micro motherboards use didn't work they changed it to something else and when I reached out to the vendor on eBay they didn't seem to know what I was talking about the next thing I tried was to install Windows on the motherboard so that maybe I could do stuff with the system even if it's just got a GTX 1650 in it but that didn't work either because the motherboard just boot of the windows USB install I tried various versions of Windows including Windows Server installs that according to Super Micro should work on the motherboard but despite using both UEFI and Legacy installs on the USB stick I just couldn't get it to boot off it and because I didn't have access to the BIOS I couldn't change the boot priorities to make it boot off it so I was kind of screwed again now to cut a very long and annoying story short do you know how I ended up managing to get into the BIOS on the motherboard for some reason on the first setup this motherboard refuses to go into the BIOS unless you use the Mesozoic period port on the motherboard as a video output and no one tells you that nowhere on the internet does it tell you this motherboard is a and the only way that you can get into the BIOS on first boot only is by using the Mesozoic period port on the motherboard the craziest part is I tell the eBay seller that after I figured it out and they go oh yeah by the way you have to use the Mesozoic period port on the motherboard to get onto it in the first boot what why didn't you tell me that days ago when I first told you I couldn't get into the BIOS I know that now I figured that out through massive trial and error and wasting hours of my life with huge frustration I hate this motherboard so much but before I rupture an artery in my heart and let's just move on I've managed to get into the BIOS and all is now well in the world potentially oh that's a different screen [Music] oh my God it's the BIOS it's so beautiful I just needed a VGA Monitor and after spending a while configuring the bios so that the system behaves normally cross-referencing all the stuff I didn't understand with the manual I then installed Windows still using the Mesozoic period board okay we have windows in the house this is there's still a lot of struggling that needs to happen but Windows is on here oh yeah look at that 240 why is it say 15 out of 16 slots used it turns out one of the sticks of Amazon Ram was dead moving on we also have this madness I then moved the jumper back from Mesozoic mode to external graphics card mode and finally went through the fun process of finding a graphics card this stupid motherboard won't turn its nose up at the only one my Lord ended up accepting other than the GTX 1650 was an RTX A2000 Quadro card I happen to have lying around a worthy sacrifice on the pile of unworthy now the case I'm gonna use is the monolithic hashtag sponsored by be quiet dark Bass Pro 901 be quiet the sexy choice this case is wild we'll get into some of the features while we're building in it but it's even got like a hidden Bay for DVD drives in the front something you never see anymore [Music] [Applause] foreign ly this is a monolithic case with huge amounts of flexibility in terms of motherboard orientation radiator options it can take just a ridiculous amount of hard drives for a modern case but what I'm the most interested in today is this case's ability to subsume pretty much any motherboard it's got standoff support all the way to the other end of this cable hiding bracket thing oh those are nice thumb screws holding the side panel on whoa that's a heavy panel so it comes with two pre-installed 140 millimeter silent Wing fours in the front and one in the back so it comes with very high quality fans pre-installed that's awesome to see on a case like this what's super cool is how the fan mounting works so you undo those and you pull this out and all the fans are plugged into a hub on the radiator Mount which connects to the main Hub in the case via contact pins so you don't have to worry about like ripping cables out and stuff this is a really smart idea now of course we have no choice but to continue using the be quiet dark Power Pro 13 is the power supply because we can match the awesome thumb screws on the mounting bracket with this spectacular thumb screws that come with the dark Power Pro 13. oh no thank you oh I sure am glad this power supply comes with braided cables included oh yeah that is some thumb screw erotic fan fiction right there [Music] okay so now is the Moment of Truth we get to see if the one monstrosity fits in the other monstrosity it does just not without modification so oh luckily we just undo a couple of sexy thumb screws there we go and after moving some of the standoffs into the appropriate position for the massive motherboard I mounted the board and we were ready to admire the monster combining high-end consumer stuff with crazy server Hardware always looks wild you've got this like blacked out case with this insane motherboard in it that is all green it really emanates this Aura of intimidating power but yeah we're actually getting really close there's not a whole lot left to do I just need to drop that little Quadro graphics card in here which is going to look especially ridiculous in this case and then I think we can test it oh that's such a cool looking system [Music] oh it's so heavy that is complete Madness I I didn't think I'd ever see something like this in person look at that now obviously the first thing we're gonna do with it is watch this monstrosity tear through cinebench I wonder if we're gonna get the top score here we may actually hey look at that the little squares are so tiny [Music] hey the second highest score and it's it's not that far behind either that is real exciting stuff look at that the crazy thing is this isn't even the system's full power remember one of the sticks of Amazon Ram is dead so we've got an empty channel on one of the CPUs and all of this ramp is pretty losery 2133 megahertz ECC and the system supports up to 3200 megahertz ECC now I am gonna buy 16 sticks of 3200 megahertz Ram to see the system's full potential I'll post a short when that arrives showing the result of that but anyway let's have a look at the single threaded performance because I think that's gonna be a lot less impressive yeah [Music] Okay so we've got similar single threaded performance to a 200 year old I5 which is not that bad I was honestly expecting it to be lower than that which means now we get to see the gaming performance of this system it's time to Pace your bets my bet is that even the little A2000 is going to be waiting around for these two epic CPUs but let's find out foreign this system is much less of a beast this is Battlefield 5 at 1080p High settings and as you can see I was pretty much right there's not a massive CPU bottleneck going on with the A2000 but there's definitely one happening remember an A2000 has roughly similar gaming performance to an RTX 3050 so it's not a beast of a gaming graphics card but the Epic CPUs are still struggling to keep up although I will say I think it's going better than I was expecting wow the cyberpunk is going worse than I was expecting there's so much CPU power but it's just so not the correct type of CPU power for what we're doing if only cyberpunk could use 64 cores you know although with The Last of Us it can actually kind of keep up with the A2000 I'm guessing it's got good enough multi-threaded support maybe I don't know but there are games where the A2000 isn't waiting around for those epic CPUs that's pretty cool um let's change that uh doing anything with ram takes so so long on this system oh yeah that easily has to be the most Savage single Channel configuration ever uh now because we have two CPUs in here I don't think it's gonna work with just that one stick of ram down here but I'm just testing it just to see maybe maybe maybe it works otherwise we'll just drop another stick in the top there which will still technically make it a single Channel configuration but let's see if this works a few moments later yep it's not posting okay so we need to give the second CPU a stick as well which checks out that makes complete sense oh that's weird it's only reading one of the two sticks let's see what cpu-z has to say about this whoa there's like so much latency what in the world okay I don't completely understand what's happening here but it seems like we're about to do some gaming with one stick of ram between two CPUs that each have eight memory channels oh yeah there we go that is what you want to see okay it's it's picking up a little bit now we got 30-ish frames per second there briefly now that we've been in the match a bit longer it is starting to wake up a bit but we're still we're still topping out at like 40 frames per second it takes the system a shockingly long time for all the game assets to load in but once they're all loaded when it comes to a standardized Benchmark honestly it's not that bad considering what's going on here that is a very impressive result especially the one percent lows like what it's a similar story with cyberpunk don't get me wrong the game is borderline unplayable and there's a lot of input lag but when it comes to Raw Benchmark figures the difference is surprisingly small but I will say it feels a lot worse than the numbers suggest but apparently the last of us doesn't seem to care about CPU memory bandwidth very much although it feels terrible there's so much input lag what's interesting is when you stand still the frame rate's quite stable but the moment you move that happens cinebench is not as lucky the number is way smaller but still I'm surprised at how well epic handles being stabbed in the guts which brings me to the end of the video thank you very much be quiet for sponsoring the video there are some links in the description you should go check out and maybe check out part one of this video as well and until the next video thank you for watching bye [Music] [Music] thank you [Music]",

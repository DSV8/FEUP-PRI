    "transcript": "today i'm going to turn this rgb vomitron system i bought from best buy with the world's first desktop 8 core cpu in it into something a bit more modern with the help of sponsored by be quiet now the first part that i want to change in this rgb hot rod of a system is the motherboard because the motherboard that's in here does not support overclocking and considering that the 5960x which is the cpu that we're working with has quite low stock frequencies i think the best way that we can get more performance out of this system aside from addressing the obvious blasphemy committed by the system builder is by putting a motherboard in here that supports overclocking now considering that we're gonna be changing out the motherboard we may as well also swap the case in the process to something by hashtag sponsored by be quiet and i'm also gonna be replacing the power supply because i do not trust the power supply in there uh but anyway before we do any of that stuff let's do a quick baseline performance reading just so that we can see how much better we can get the system running by the end of the video now with battlefield 5 running at 1080p highest settings despite the low core frequency on the 5960x you can see that it's still managing to keep up with the gtx 1650 which you'd kind of hope that it would be able to keep up with the 1650 right especially in battlefield 5 which is you know it's it's very multi-core optimized but we are gonna upgrade the graphics card at some point so we do want some more performance but yeah it's a good baseline and actually in terms of temperatures despite the hardcore intake fan choking action on this case the temperatures are still decent although i'm sure the temperatures will be even better once we upgrade to some hashtags sponsored by required parts on that note let's get to the upgrade so basically what i'm going to do now is i'm going to pull the graphics card and the motherboard out and then pretty much the rest of the system we're just going to abandon outside an spca oh and i also want to get the uh the ssd out wait i just realized why am i taking the motherboard out i'm not gonna i'm not gonna be using it i just need to take the cpu out whoa that is a big ass cpu interestingly a ryzen cpu isn't significantly smaller than the 5960x but you can get up to 16 cores that are way faster than the core is in here so yeah it's just crazy how quickly cpu technology has developed as of late but now that we have our 5960x in hand we're gonna drop it into the motherboard that hopefully has better overclocking feature now this was the only remotely reasonably priced x99 board that i could locally find for sale and it's an asus x99a board now in terms of features these x99 boards don't have anything super modern on them like we don't have any usbc or anything but it's not too bad we've got a bunch of usb3 and with this board we even have an m.2 slot and interestingly this board actually has a sata express port on it which was like i guess a short-lived alternative to the m.2 slot so this motherboard actually had both options on it but with that let's drop our 5960x in here and then build our hashtag sponsored by be quiet upgrade system and then see how it overclocks now in an attempt to assert my dominance on the cpu i'm just gonna leave it with the single stick of ram and it's definitely not to see how much of a difference upgrading the ram makes once we've overclocked now in terms of the case we're going to use one of my favorites which is this hashtag sponsored by be quiet 500dx which is awesome we've got some good ventilation on the front with a bit of rgb and then behind all that airflow we're going to be using some of the up to 360 ml radiator support in the 500dx but by far the most important upgrade we're going to be making today is going to be this pure power 11 fm replacing that terrible power supply that came with that system and you know a power supply is not messing around when it's got german writing on the label now i'm actually really excited that we got a nice condition rear i o shield with this motherboard it's even one of these poofy ones uh that is surprisingly not always a given when buying a used older motherboard oh come on is that fully it no it's not oh there we go and then yay now this is a very random thing to point out but this 500dx has like the most malleable usb 3 front header cable i've ever seen in a case which is lovely because it means that it's so much easier to handle and malleability it's so flexible now the next step is to deal with the cooling for this very powerful cpu and i think i have a company in mind that may make some good coolers that we can use for this use case i'm going to be using this 280 millimeter pure loop aio now there is a 360 ml version of this aio but i like me a 280mm aio and this should be plenty of cooling for the 5960x okay we're good nothing broke and remember kids always remove this bit of plastic otherwise you're gonna have a bad day i made a mistake that looks really cool there's something about that brushed metal faceplate on the be quiet coolers that work really well with the asus like prime motherboard aesthetic yay it's done now we're not gonna do any glory shots just yet because well we are going to upgrade the ram configuration from the absolute heinous abomination that it is now and we're also going to upgrade the graphics card but that looks so good it looks way better than the previous configuration in my opinion let's see how this runs now and what kind of overclocking feature we have with this new motherboard oh damn look at those cpu temps we have some crazy headroom now so yeah let's let's try some overclocking oh yeah well tpu is the motherboard based cpu overclocking and it says the tpu-2 applies an overclock suitable for water cooled cpus so that is what we are start tuning okay well it broke msi afterburner's power draw reporting for some reason it's saying it's just using a watt which i i am convinced is not the case uh but we have a much higher core frequency on the cpu 3.9 gigahertz after this i did my standardized benchmarks for battlefield v which despite the higher core frequency didn't give us any better performance which makes sense considering that the gtx 1650 seems to be the bottleneck here so before we get to the manual overclock i think we need to kick that loser to the curb i think this rtx 3060 tough gaming that we've seen quite a bit on the channel will be a good upgrade for the system so let's pop it in there hey that looks really cool i like how the gpu is kind of tucked under this aio cable it all fits in very nicely wow the 5960x is keeping up with the 3060 much better than i was expecting at 1080p uh i did change the settings to ultra as opposed to high because we don't have a 1650 in here anymore so what i'm going to do is a benchmark and then we're going to do some more overclocking and see how close we can get to proper 360 utilization oh many core frequencies now and it's still just using 1.3 watts so that is that's some impressive efficiency right there and the temperatures are great as well that aio is handling it very well and we need to bear in mind here that this is running with a single stick of ram in a quad channel motherboard so that's that's another level of impressiveness uh because you know usually with single channel configurations like it really affects the frame pacing like the game's really stuttery but this is one of the smoother battlefield 5 gaming experiences i've seen in a while actually however when it comes to benchmark results it didn't make much of a difference which could be down to said ram configuration but before we fix that let's just see how far we can push this overclock holy crap okay so we have an all core of 4.8 gigahertz running now i don't think you can get an all core of 4.8 gigahertz on a 5000 series ryzen cpu with eight pores in it this is actually kind of wild do we do we try five no no that's that's not worked now i'm gonna be using the same vengeance pro rgb kit that i used in the original best buy video i don't know there's something so awesome about the two banks of ram on either side of the cpu it just looks so awesome now populating all of the ram channels did add some additional instability so i actually had to drop the core frequency to 4.5 gigahertz that's all core and uh the four ram sticks are running at 26.66 megahertz but as it is here it is running very very well you can see that we're almost fully utilizing our rtx 3060 and we've got some high frame rates uh in fact when i did my my control benchmark run on battlefield 5 we're getting about 20 more performance in battlefield 5. of the other games that i tested cyberpunk also ran very well on this configuration seeing large gains over the initial stock configuration the same with battlefield 5 in this regard however gta 5 which is an older less well optimized for multi-core game didn't fare as well with these upgrades but we still did get a reasonable amount more performance which brings me to the end of the video thank you so much be quiet for sponsoring today's video if you enjoyed the video consider subscribing to the channel and maybe watching another one a suggestion will pop up in a second and until the next video thank you for watching bye you",

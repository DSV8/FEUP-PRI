    "transcript": "- Hey guys it's Justine and I'm here with Sam and today we are glamping in, are we in Joshua Tree? - I think we're in Joshua Tree. - We're in Joshua Tree today. We're so excited because we're celebrating Valentine's Day and we thought, what is a cool thing that you could do on Valentine's Day? You can go glamping. - In Joshua Tree. - And make a cake. That's what we're going to do in Joshua Tree. - What kind of cake are we making? - So I got some things, so we're going to make a heart cake. And I brought this, this is a table for our campsite. - For our wonderful setup here. - This is our campsite. - This is how you do luxury glamping in Los Angeles - We're-- - At Joshua Tree. - In Joshua Tree. - So this is our table? - Yeah, this is our table, so this is where we're going to have a really delicious meal. - Okay, and we're just gonna make do with what we have here. - That's what you do when you are out in the wilderness. - Wonderful, wonderful. - Careful, I don't want you to get hurt. - Yes, but I don't think it should be that hard. - Do we need a knife? - No I don't think so. - Are you sure? We always need a knife. Let me go get one. There might be bears. - I'm gonna get started on this. - Okay. - So, as you can see we have our fancy table legs and our even fancier table top out here in the wilderness. - [Justine] I love the wilderness. - In Joshua Tree. - There might be bears. - What? - I did not sign up for this! - I don't think anybody signs up for it. - We gotta cut this off, Justine. - It's kind of deceiving. - Oh! - I don't think it's working. - [Both] Oh! - Should we put on a U2 album, or what's up? - Wow. - [Justine] Okay. - Is that a throw back to the iPod? The U2 iPod? - Oh my gosh. - Is that a Valentine's Day reference? - Oh, wow! Do you have insurance? - I certainly do. - Yay. - I don't know if it covers daggers to the eye, though. - So I do want to mention that this is, everything that we have here, I bought on Amazon Prime Now. - Like, 10 minutes before this video? - It arrived 20 minutes ago. - Are we missing something? I love glamping. This is cool. Aw, we don't have a tent. - Have you baked a cake outside before? - How're we gonna do this? - We're gonna make a fire. - Out here in Joshua Tree. - Out here in Joshua Tree. - Okay. - Which probably... I don't think you're allowed to do that. This is gonna melt. This is not gonna work at all, actually. - Well, enjoy the video while you have it. How big of a fire are we talking? - Well, like, I haven't thought about it yet. - Okay. Yay! - This is not supposed to be the video. - Yay! - Okay, I think we got a... - [Sam] What's the problem? - What is that sound? - I don't know, it sounds-- - [Justine] We're in the middle of nowhere. Is that a bird? - It sounds like we're being invaded by a toy. - Hmm. - Okay. - Okay, so-- - Really hope that this doesn't fall. I don't know what these are for. Maybe to connect two of them I think. - Probably. We don't need that. I'll put my machete away. - Oh my god, please watch those fingers. Now I think we actually like, bake this cake, right? - [Justine] Yeah, I think we do. We're still in Joshua Tree. - Definitely not. - Yeah, we're in Joshua Tree, this is great place. Well, Mr. Roomatte, okay this is working out so well. Have you made a cake before, ever? - Yeah, I've made brownies. - [Justine] Oh, like special ones? - All brownies are special. - [Justine] Yeah, that's what I mean. Were they special to you? - Super special brownies, yeah. - We're making a strawberry, premium, naturally and artificially flavored heart cake. I love camping. This is so fun. - Yeah, I go glamping probably like once a week. - Really? - Out here in Joshua Tree, yup. - The weather is incredible. - Can't say I've baked a heart-shaped cake on my glamping excursions, but, you know. - I know. - First time for everything. - I haven't either. Would you like to crack the eggs? - I don't wanna mess that up. I've had bad luck with egg cracking in my day, to be quite honest. - Oops, I'm making a mess. Does it matter? - I don't want to jeopardize the integrity of said cake. - This smells incredible. Oh my god! - Ah, the temptation to just (inhaling). - Oooh. - That would probably make me sick. Wow! I forgot you can do that. Okay, challenge. - Yes. - Go grab three more of those daggers and juggle those. - So I ordered knives-- - Wow, that was so impressive. - To juggle, and my mom made me return them on Amazon because she was here in town, and she was like no. - Yeah. - Okay, I feel like you need a task. Okay, one-- (laughing) We need a cup of water. - Okay. - Since we're out in the desert. - I can make that happen. Oh, wow, thank you for the water. One cup of water. - Yeah, there-- - Okay. - There might be enough there. - If not, we'll just-- - We will... We're in the desert. - Yeah. - So the lack of water is really... You could put that in there. - Okay. - Yeah. - There's no order of operations? - I mean, probably, but clearly that doesn't matter. - Have you baked a cake before? - Oh yes, I've baked many. - Okay, so we're in good hands here. - We also need a half cup of oil. - Okay. - I love bringing oil to the desert. What's your favorite place to camp at? Here, obviously. - The wilderness. Wait, you said half a cup or a full cup? - Half cup. - Coming right up. - Yep, just put that in there. - Yes, here we go. Oh my god, it smells so good. - It does smell incredible. So normally I would probably used like a stand mixer or something. But we're in the desert. - Right. - There's no electricity. - There's no outlets out here. Mix until moistened, beat with mixer on medium for two minutes. You've got it going here. - Hello, I'm here. - Bake at 350. - How long? - Well, pan size, six inches across. - I probably-- - Maybe eight inches. I don't know. Anywhere in the vicinity of 25 minutes to 30 minutes. - That's a long time. - Yeah, I know. We're gonna have to get this fire going. - Oh. - [Sam] I have matches, so we can start there. If desired, substitute four egg whites or... okay. - We're not gonna substitute, because we already put the eggs in. - No no no no no no. - So the one thing that is extremely important when you're baking is... Hey Tyler, can you throw me that spray? That spray right there? Thank you so much. You... oh, that's okay, that's fine. It's totally not important. We're in the desert. There's no one else here. It's so desolate and remote. You wanna always spray the pan. - Yes, so it doesn't get stuck. - Yes. This is probably also very flammable. - Can I do something really stupid? - [Justine] Yeah, go ahead, do it. I know what you're gonna do. I love it. (match striking) (can spraying) - [Both] Whoa! - Wow. - Yeah. - Wow! - Whoa! Should I go get the fire extinguisher now? - Oh, yeah, we should have that on deck. - We should definitely. - You know what's funny? I've actually never done that in my whole life. - Today's the day. - That was... wow. - Today's the day. - I feel very accomplished. I'm glad I came all the way out here-- - [Justine] There is fire everywhere. - To Joshua Tree. Do not try that at home, kids. Yeah, and especially not in the desert or Joshua Tree either. - [Justine] No way, never! It's dry here! Have you ever used one of these before? - I have, actually. - I have-- - It sucks. - They make a mess. - An absolute mess. If you don't know, it kinda shoots out this misty, fine powder. - Yeah, it's like foam, right? - It sucks. - Yeah. Don't do that unless you're really putting out a fire. - I used one in my last place that I lived. That's why I don't live in the other place anymore. - Do I pour it with this little lip? - Yes, this is a lovely Roseanna Pansino bowl. - [Sam] How high do I go? - [Justine] Probably not too high. That's good, I think, yeah. - Will it rise? - It will rise a little. - Okay, have ever used these heart-shaped pans before? - I have, yes. - Gotta get some logs. Okay, wait, hold on, let me get this-- - You're gonna burn your finger. - I'm gonna get this a little... - Oooh! Yeah, that's not gonna work. We need a bigger flame. - Do we have something that can bake this? Alright, so let's see. This is like cooking it on a stove. I don't know if this is gonna work. It also might melt this little contraption. Let's elevate this a little bit. We can properly cook it and try again. I'll do two matches this time. Maybe that will set things up better for me. I'm definitely, definitely heating it up. (flame surging) I think this might be working. - I don't think that's working. - [Sam] Oh dear. - I don't think that's working. - [Sam] Are you gonna... oh god. (flame surging) - Alright, let's make this happen. Let's make mommy's cake! Tonight! You should not be standing there, is what you should-- - Is it gonna... are you gonna pull the trigger? (flame surging) - Yep. Time to cook! - Wow! - Is it cooking? - Oh my god, it is. It's so warm! - Oh my god, it's boiling! - This actually might work. - [Justine] No, you don't think it's gonna work? - It might work. - [Justine] No, this is definitely gonna work. We're cooking now! Do not... you're dangerous. You should not be-- - Ah, I feel the drift! - You should not be there. - Wow, that is so hot. - What's burning? What's burning? Is something burning? Oh my god, it's like-- - Is the whole thing melting? - I don't know what's happening. - I don't know, either. - I'm not sure. - I really hope it doesn't-- - Oh my god! It's baking! - It's on fire. Is it baking? Oh my god! - Look at that. It's done. - It's like-- - The cake is done. - Wow. Wow, that actually kind of maybe worked a little bit. - No, that didn't maybe work. That freaking worked. - Wow. Should we let it sit? - Maybe we let it sit a little bit. - [Sam] Okay. - I didn't think it was gonna work. - Me neither! That like really worked fast. - Yeah. - And that was maybe 30 seconds of a-- - Was incredible. - Wow, screw using an oven. - There's no point. - Especially in the wilderness. - Joshua Tree, yeah, wow. - Nothing went wrong. Like we-- - That makes nervous. - We started with not a cake, and we have a cake. - We have a... yeah, wow-wee. - Look at this. - Should we cut into it? - Have you ever seen something so beautiful on Valentine's Day? - I haven't. I think I need to give it just one more little crisp. - Okay, I'm gonna-- - Just one more little crisp. - I'm gonna stand back. - I just wanna make sure. (slow electronic music) - Proceed with caution. - Proceed with caution, and also you need some oven mitts. - So I shouldn't grab this and move it aside? - Definitely not, but I can because I've got these mitts! Is it gonna flip? - No way. - Well, we greased it up. - Let's see. - Whoa, that is... This is... - I'm more afraid of this pan-- - Oh my god. - Wow, wow. - I am so-- - Correct me if I'm wrong, but does that not look like grilled cheese? - It actually kinda smells like grilled cheese. We shouldn't eat it, though. Don't... because it's not done yet. - We shouldn't eat it? - Well, not yet. We have to put the icing on it. - Oh, we have to decorate it, yes yes. - Have you decorated a cake before? - No, I have not. - These are also from Rose's baking line. - Oh, this is how you make it all pretty. - Yes! So I think the middle may be a little... - [Sam] Little flavorful? - [Justine] Still-- - [Sam] Little mushy? - Not quite cooked thoroughly. - Okay. - Don't push too hard, because-- - Oh, boy. - I think the center may still be a little... Little gooey. - Do we take the flame to it again? - [Justine] We can, after we're done. Man, camping is fun. - Mm-hm, I agree. You've-- - Surprisingly, I love icing cakes so much. - Why is that surprising in the slightest? - I don't know, it's like building a LEGO set or something. It's super therapeutic. - Oh, you like making it. - No, I like icing it. - Okay, you like icing it. - Yeah, it's fun. It's okay, because-- - It's looking like a... - It's looking like a pancake. Like a flattented-- - Yeah. I don't know, this to me, all I see is melted mozzarella cheese. So this is not your first rodeo. - [Justine] The first I've made using a flame-thrower. - Watch the Food Network once. - Watch the Food Network once. Gourmet. - Grabs the flame-thrower. No, you're much better at this than I am. And then we get to do the sprinkles! - It's not perfect, but you know what? We're in the desert, and it's hot, and the icing's melting. - iJustine, Youtuber, cake-baker extraordinaire. Good this looks! - Actually looks really good. No one's even gonna believe that this was done with a flame-thrower. Good luck! - [Sam] You, too. I'll try not to eat these along the way. - [Justine] Well, they're edible. - [Sam] To a degree. Yeah, this is pretty good. - It's actually really good. Okay, I'll put one right in the middle. - Okay. Now there's one thing left to do. - We have to cut the cake. - We have to cut the cake. - [Justine] And taste it. - [Sam] Okay. - So I brought out a different one. This one is a little bit sharper. - (inhaling) Okay. - So... - [Sam] And you're touching it, very wise. - I just wanted to make sure. We're gonna cut this right down the middle. It still looks pretty good. I'm impressed. Is it cooked in the middle? What do you think? - Uh, I think so. Like I said, grilled cheese. - [Justine] It does look like a grilled cheese. It's kinda crazy. - With pink cheese. (Justine inhaling) Imagine that we just accidentally made a meme. Pink cheese, 2019. - Well, haven't you seen the rainbow grilled cheeses before? - No, what? - That was so like, two years ago. - I've seen rainbow bagels from like Brooklyn. - No, rainbow grilled cheese. I made green, shamrock grilled cheese. - I, I made green! Wait, do you remember the green ketchup, Hines ketchup? - I do! - And they did. Ho, yes, yeah, wow. - Do we try it, is the question. - I think so. - Okay. - We might as well. - Alright. - Just to satisfy the viewer. - I'm gonna put my knife down. - Okay. - Okay. - I wanna take like, the little edge where it's actually cooked. - [Justine] Yeah, yeah, okay, so let's... - And just go like this. - Alright. Okay. - Okay. - Oh, it smells really bad. - Yeah, we smell the char. - Yuck. Okay. - Mmm. - Cheers. - Bottoms up. - [Justine] Yep. - Yummy! Mmm, tastes like strawberries. - [Justine] It does takes like strawberries. This is actually really good. - Nice and gooey. - I enjoyed it. We definitely... like the edges are baked. - I think we can say, with confidence, we baked a cake. - We baked a cake, in Joshua Tree. - On Valentine's Day. - On Valentine's Day. - With a flame-thrower disguised... A roofing torch disguised as a flame-thrower. - Yeah, don't actually ever eat this. - Nope. - Because that's really dangerous. - Yeah. - Because we faked it. - Yep, we baked-- - Just for the record. - We baked a second cake in Justine's kitchen that is right there. - It's still hot. - That is the power of doing things that are edited and not live. - The internet is an entire lie, but what is not a lie is we actually did bake this with a flame-thrower, though. That is true. This is really good. This is incredible. A boxed strawberry cake. - Pretty good. - It's actually really good. - Pretty good. - This is still the batter that we cooked, though, out here. - Correct, well-- - It's not entirely the lie. - Yeah. - We're also not in Joshua Tree. - Oh, no way! - I know, right? - What do you say? - Cool. Well guys, thanks for watching. Go check out Sam's channel. I'll put all of his links below in the description. Go say hi. We're gonna eat the rest of this cake. - Mm-hm. - And, the last time somebody ate a cake I baked, they got food poisoning. So we should probably actually stop-- (coughing) You should probably stop. - Well, happy Valentine's Day. - Yeah, happy Valentine's Day. This was really fun. Thanks so much for hanging out. - From me and Justine, in Joshua Tree. - To you guys. - Okay, let's keep eating. - You are gonna poop yourself. - Mm-hm. - Yep. - Because of the food poisoning. - Because of the food poisoning.

    "transcript": "well hello good people want to hear something crazy this machine right here has the same specs as this guy what what what I never thought I would say it but this is the only pre-built system that the Box she liked and used for the past six months and then of course there's like hey we want it back so I'm really having a hard time dealing with that fact I mean this is a twelve liter enclosure and this guy is 66 or a size difference Fred for scale so this thing is a very good-looking extremely powerful quiet and compact and there we go Corsair one let's all appreciate what they've done with the system from the ground up and compared to my own build with the same specs hopefully my system is superior I mean how could it not I have the best CPU cooler on the planet for its size the best fans the most air flow ready enclosure the graphics cooler alone is like half the size of the courser one so this should be fun wanna step up your airflow game look no further than the master fan SF 120 M from coolermaster featuring a damping frame designed to ensure stability a connected fan lane design for optimal cooling performance and an anti vibration motor that ensures better acoustics it's very simple to install and it comes with three fan speed controls check it out down below so I know it's not exactly fair to compare the coarser one versus my full tower but even next to other ITX options like the LDO 3 by silverstone then case V 4 even the massive h2 10 from NZXT this package looks impressive so my exact model is the Corsair One i165 with rtx 2080 TI and 9900K both liquid cooled 32 gigs of ram 1 terabyte SSD and a 2 terabyte hard drive while my own system has a 2080 TI in 9900K 64 gigs of ram and my own set of SSDs so let me show you exactly why I love this machine so much and why I don't want to return it the first thing I need to impress you with is cooling so my own system has six fans unrestrictive airflow from the front but as you can see lots of wasted space while the one has a single 140 mm loaf an exhausting air from the top that's it you see these little stickers here that will avoid your warranty my friends don't care did it anyway there's an extra fan for the GPU but it's pretty insane given how well the system is cooled compared to my own creation so both the CPU and the GPU have slim radiators and airflow is passively intake from each side and exhaust is from the top and I think all we can do is respect the results after 30 minutes of stress testing the CPU on the coarser one is only three degrees hotter with a much cooler GPU might I add and that is awesome to see I kept everything on auto clocks to see what frequencies we get and they are pretty damn close with around 1900 megahertz on both machines for the GPU and the 9900k otto boosted to 4.7 gigahertz and all course while in game and the fact that they're so close to performance while being the four times the size difference that's impressive this means all my gaming and synthetic results are basically identical but slight variation here and there and it's good to see there are no significant performance penalties with the Corsair One and so this is what custom compact engineering delivers versus a more standard PC configuration there is no GPU throttling which is great and no loud behavior either and while my CPU is 3 degrees cooler with an ocular configuration all the fans are running at 2,000 rpm which means my own system is so much louder and I honestly was not expecting the coarser one to perform this wall in the acoustics department now as for cpu performance in gaming spine reaching to 4.7 gigahertz but in blender for example we drop to 3.6 here Hertz even though there's enough voltage so by default CPU performance outside of gaming is slower because my D machine clocks to 4.7 and Beyond easy during those intense renders and so it looks like the motherboard on the coarser one isn't able to deliver enough power to the 9900K to stay above 4 gigahertz at full load and overclocking is only partially available in the BIOS so I increase the power limit and got to 3.9 gigahertz on all cores at full load but unfortunately it's still locked to 95 watt power limit by the motherboard another aspect of my own system that is superior is DAO just more USB ports from the motherboard and type-c in the front while the one is adequate but also kind of disappointing there's an HDMI port at the front instead of a type C because of the original VR focus of the one lineup and so I started using the i165 after my water cooled system was finished because that was only used for video production and the tiny size of the one meant I could simply place it beside the monitor plug it in and enjoy some games so my work and play computer were separated plus for some reason the red dead redemption through still does not launch on my threaded machine I don't know why now I do want to address some of the long-term concerns I've have with the Corsair i165 first one being there are no dust filters on the side panels and that is for performance sake otherwise it will block off whatever air is trying to enter through that top exhaust fan but still the machine is looking very clean when I looked inside no dust bunnies generated but there's a tiny layer of dust like on the pump and like around the components so you could potentially vacuum up anything from the sides and that would freshen up the system a little bit the warranty for coarser systems as two years so if he's replace anything beyond that time the CPU the RAM the hard drive the power supply are all accessible and replaceable of course in doing so by opening up the machine you void the warranty and it's really disappointing to me that overclocking is so limited because the motherboard locks the TDP of the chip to 95 watts and nothing beyond that which kind of sucks because at $3,500 for my cursor I have 165 machine exactly I mean you'd expect the same potential of performance as you with the DIY system with the same components which brings me to my last point and that is the lack of availability of this standalone enclosure coursers doing this for multiple reasons most likely they're not going to be making a lot of money of it because the volumes are not going to be there and it's actually quite difficult to build in but I feel like that's where the ITX market is heading into anyway so you expect a little bit of challenge when it comes to building something extremely compact and powerful but I would love for Corsair to at least think about offering the coarser one enclosure with the side radiators and maybe like a power supply in the bottom as a package unit so you can populate your own GPU and your motherboard CPU RAM and storage because the components inside the machine are off-the-shelf anyway but it's been a really good run with the Corsair one and it's got me thinking I want to build something equivalent specifically for gaming that is also targeting like a very compact form factor and I have the den case v4 in house really excited to put my ITX motherboard in there some beefy GPU so this thing can live on my desk as well and have my games so that I don't interfere with my production machine and have those two things separate so stay tuned for that video all right guys I hope you enjoyed thanks much for watching check out this other relevant content over here subscribe for more I'll talk to you in next video",

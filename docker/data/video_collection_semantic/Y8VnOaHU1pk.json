    "transcript": "- Why do gamers always get the cool stuff? Like HP Omen and ASUS ROG and stuff. They're just like, oh, you get a 2080, you get a 2070, like here's a 300-watt power supply, get two of them, screw up. And then like, you know, the professionals, they're like, oh, we spend so much time on this beautiful XPS 15, but it gets a 1650. So like, if you want a game, if you want to do anything, that's like more than looking at photos, like screw you, you don't have enough power. Well, HP hopes to change that with the HP Z Create. This thing right here, it's apparently, you know, like pretty reasonable size, like it's half a small one, but it's got an i9 at a 2070 super, so let's give her a look. (box thudding) This is one of those things that no one really cares about, but every single brand loves to talk about it. They've got this recycled cardboard in here, which actually smells pretty good. (tape whirring) I don't think this plastic right here is going straight for the landfill. Toddlers going to choke on that, it's going to be tragic. This is Z by HP, I don't really get it when companies do branding like that, but whatever, it's an HP Z Create, boom, laptop, laptop, boom. Turn here, what do we have for document? We don't have any documentation. Is this a pre-production unit? There's zero documentation at all. So like, we have just a power brick and nothing else to tell us that it complies with whatever standard, which actually, that's one of the things that they said when they were making this. They were like, yeah, it's really easy to hit all of the certifications for a gaming notebook, but when you want to make it so that it can be given to, like professionals, and meet all of those specifications, it's a lot harder. We have some construction going on, that's the air compressor lines getting installed. Anyway, we have a 200 watt power brick. It's definitely better than the really little one that you get with the XPS 17, that thing's way underpowered. So, you know, we've got the classic, all aluminum construction. So I think all of in here is, you know, seeing sit aluminum, back plate here, it's aluminum, top, that also feels like aluminum. Yeah, so this version right here, I think you can get one that's just under five pounds. This one's just over five pounds. They're about, the finish on this edge here is really great. That must be diamond cut. It is, that is beautiful. But anyway, we've got a full size SD card reader, which I love. You will need a dongle though, for the mini display port that's here, but whatever, you've got two thunderbolts right beside it, so those make up for that. We also have power in (thudding), power in, oh (beep) (laughing) Yeah, if I really Linus that one, I always chuck these around and people get nervous, finally bit me. And then on this side, we got a full size USB type A. We also have a lot of venting on the side here. So I'm kind of curious how the thermals work in this. So we've got, I'm guessing intake here, a lot comes out there, and then along the side, I guess, oh, there's also a headphone, microphone combo port right there, which, I guess, we can't take for granted on laptops anymore. Anyway, let's get right into it here. Well, we're going to open it up, but then we'll actually get into it using today's sponsor, iFixit. Thanks to iFixit it for sponsoring today's video. iFixit's Black Friday deals start now, and it's the perfect time of year to start your iFixit tool collection or give them as gifts. Can't wrap gifts? No problem. Right now, take $10 off the ProTech bundle and $50 off the ultimate iFixit kit. Head to iFixit.com/Linus, and use code circuit 10 for another $10 off. Hurry, the code expires December 1st. This, I said it before, but I'm going to say it again. This is the most laptop-looking laptop I've seen in quite some time. I like it, I enjoy the look overall, and the build quality is excellent, but there's nothing special about it. You have this little bit of diamond cut around the track pad, that's kind of fun. Besides that, it's about as standard beans, laptop looking as you can get. We have these nice thin bezels along the sides, but it is just plastic around the rest. At the same time, like who cares? It's a business laptop. You're buying this thing because it's fast, not because it's sexy. It's not 10 out of 10 sexy, but it's good enough. HP was like, they were hyping up their new dream color display. And they were like, have you heard of it? And I was like, is it a good IPS? And they were like, yeah. And they weren't lying, it is an excellent IPS, like, it's quite beautiful. I believe it's up to 600 nits brightness, and this right here is the 4k one. You can also get, I think up to a thousand nits on a 1080P one, but that has the share view screen, which is good for privacy, 'cause that's the one where you like, when you're off-axis, you can't see it. But also apparently those displays are just bad to look at. So I don't know. One thing that this screen does not have though, is touch, which is kind of disappointing. That said, this computer isn't really the sort of thing that you need touch screen support on. So let's take a look at what we actually have in this. So we have an Intel core i9, 10885H, that's an eight core CPU. It goes up to like, I think it's 4.9 gigahertz, I don't know, I put the actual number here. A two terabyte SSD, which I think is upgradeable, the RAM is not. About the power, Wifi 6 card from Intel, excellent. And the good old RTX 2070 with Max-Q design. This right here is available, with up to a 2080. But I wouldn't necessarily recommend that, because they do find you're really constrained on laptops like this, by thermals and power. So you're not necessarily going to get all of the advantages of the 2080 in something like this. There also is, this is the ZBook Create line, but there's the ZBook Studio line, which is the exact same thing, but with Quadro. So if you need that, then boom, go get one of those, whatever. You're an engineer, cool, good job. The deck on this computer is insanely stiff. I don't know if you can tell from there, but I'm pressing quite hard on this, and the movement that you see is that the table is not flat, it's not the laptop. It's keyboard is excellent, there's really nothing that I would say to improve it, if I'm honest, There's this excellent snap. Like it's a real, it's a real crispy feeling keyboard. (keyboard clicking) But then you have just a lot of key travel afterwards. So you're not feeling like you need to constantly bot on the mode. Okay, that's a really good result right there. So what I was trying to do is, on some laptops, you can feel the buckling point, when there's like a bit of a stiff one at the top, where you press it and you get the buckle, but it doesn't actuate the actual key when you do that. And that can kind of like, you think you've hit the key, but you haven't. And then you just kind of have to go slower and make sure that all of the words are actually coming out. This one right here, it's awesome, excellent keyboard. Good job guys. The closest keyboard to this is the one on the XPS 15, I've got right here, actually. So I guess I can compare them side by side. This is currently my favorite keyboard on the market and yeah, they're both awesome. I really couldn't say one or the other is better. They both got that excellent snap and then fair bit of travel afterwards. The Z book is a bit stiffer. Like if you're kind of a heavy typer, you'll probably like this one more. I feel like I might be able to get slightly higher byte speeds with the Dell, I don't know, they're both awesome, excellent job. As for the track pad, oh, we've got another one of these situations. It's one of the hand loom needed track pads. It's a real phenomenon, some track pads, you know, you just need to get some of your hand gunk on there before they work well. So one thing that's very notable is the size of the track pad, it still is a pretty decent size, but I'm not a huge fan of these laptops, where they put the speakers up at the top, instead of along the sides, because you just lose that little bit of space for the track pad. That said, I think it's big enough. It feels great, I'm able to use it with my thumb, which is something you can't always do. I don't know how many other people do that, but I really like being able to use it like this. And this is excellent for that use case. Oh, the fans broke up a little bit there installing Chrome. HP did say that they have this, you know, this new fangled, AI, algorithm stuff, where they're able to control the power going to the CPU, and the GPU, and the fan speed, so that you get, basically the best experience that you can. So on a lot of laptops you'll have, let's say, a hundred watts or maybe 80 watts dedicated to the GPU. And it's just like, this 80 watts, I need it. That's mine, don't take it. Whereas in this right here, they're able to be like, Hey GPU, you're not using all of your 80 watts, like, you still have priority for that, but we're going to chuck some over to the CPU so it can do more faster things. And then sort of balance between the two, depending on what sort of a task you're doing. I think it's cool. Also the screen is calibrated from the factory. So you can immediately get into photo work with it. (waves lapping) (claws snapping) (upbeat music) I don't know which one's better. They're both really good, that's like a tie in my mind. This right here is a tiny bit more base, but it's a bit more muddy in the center. This right here, I'd say is a slight bit more like flat EQ, but you don't quite get the like (growls), so awesome job HP. That's like, maybe the best windows laptop right now. (upbeat music) I'm sorry you had to see that (laughs). Oh, we did it, yes. Okay, well. - [Man] You might just do that once it's off. - I think this bottom plate's made out of magnesium though, which is pretty fun. That's not a cheap part right there. It's basically just a vapor chamber. So we got an 83-watt hour battery. That's, I believe the same as the XPS 15. I don't think they could have fit any more battery in here, given how much cooler there is, like all of this is cooler, and all of this, basically, is vapor chamber. I'm going to take off a little bit more screws here and see if we can get a better look at it. It looks like we have a little, maybe aluminum shield here. That is probably just to make it less likely that the heat, you know, goes down into your lap instead of out the side and the back. I think we've got it, yes, we did it. Wow, that is, that right there is why this right here is a $4,000 laptop. I haven't really mentioned the price yet, but you know, it's a professional laptop. You shouldn't be surprised that it's really freaking expensive. We're specked at, I think a bit over four grand. The spec that I would go for, you can probably get away with not a two terabyte SSD. You can probably do like, one, maybe half. And like, you know, that brings it down a bit. At the same time, you probably do want like the 2070, and the i9, if you're going for this, you can probably get something a bit smaller, or like, you know, you can go for like an XPS, if you don't need that power. Oh, one more thing. They were really happy about the design of their, I think it's a liquid polymer crystal fan. ASUS has been using this in their Zephyrus line for a bit, but it allows them to make these super small fins and just have so many of them. Can you see that there, David, they're just so small. Anyway, I think this thing's awesome. If you're the sort of person that needs this kind of power, and is doing like, you know, more creative sort of stuff, it's definitely expensive, and if you go for, you know, the lineup that has the Quadros in it, it's going to be even more expensive. But at the same time, just look at this thing, it's wicked. If you guys want to see more HP vapor chamber shenanigans, we took a look at their Envy 15 a little while ago, which was wicked. They just thief the cooling system from their gaming laptop, put it in their professional laptop, great idea. And yeah, it gets subscribed. Actually, there's a laptop that should be arriving like, in an hour. You'll want to get subscribed to see that one, it's going to be wicked. Have a good day. (upbeat music) Oh, Jesus, it just turned on. That's really not good. Oh no, you don't have a cooler. Where's the battery, we're unplugging you. There we go, no more power for you. - Do as Alex says. - Yes, everyone, always unplug the battery on your laptop before you take it apart. Especially when you take it this far apart (chuckles).",

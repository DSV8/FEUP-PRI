    "transcript": "for today's video I build this system in a really stupid case I bought off Amazon it's a bit of a weirdly shaped box for a case to come in it's it's flat packed isn't it oh we've got some water damage on the box that makes it look a little bit like it's been through a digestive tract but a really short digestive system so only mild the digestive damage oh it's so limp one okay that's quite a nice paint finish we've got there feels reasonable then we've got some uh pieces of case here and then under there we've got some more Casey bits oh yeah let's get it out of here and then kind of take it from there we have this kind of loose bit oh some kidney bean glass panels and then we also get some RGB acrylic which has gotten me I don't know like 70 percent more excited about this build it's actually quite well implemented as well because you've got these like two metal plates on either side with a bit of acrylic sandwiched between them and then there's LEDs in there as well so this is quite a classy implementation of RGB acrylic which is a sentence I didn't think I'd ever say and after that excitement I found the IKEA style assembly instructions which even is somebody that's not much of an instructions person I thought for this weird case maybe role playing is an instructions loser it would save me a lot of suffering how to use chassis feet open the box okay we've done that and then we need to align the two feet now I'm assuming these two are the feet which again are immaculately painted although never mind that's some pretty serious imperfection action we've got going there now I'm not really sure how this is supposed to be aligned so there we go I guess that's fine and then the next step is to put the main body of the chassis on the foot base and tighten the screws okay and then we take this thing and then pop it in you bring the foot okay that's pretty straightforward yeah it's already starting to look like a case I guess it doesn't look like a very sturdy thing but it does look like a thing so next up we need to add the side Wing assembly method so I guess we're using these guys nice these are smooth as a freshly shaved bald head okay so I think it works like this you kind of thread that through and then we take these bling wings then we just stick these suckers through oh I had it the wrong way around damn it I've got to read through that one there we go now it all lines up way better now next up we need to PCI bracket installation method and to do this we screw the holes of the PCI bracket and the screw holes of the chassis body to fix oh yeah that sounds simple enough so I guess this which yeah it makes sense for it to be that way around now we just need to see is this the correct screw no that's very much not the correct screw no I don't think that's correct either which was the beginning of a harrowing Journey screw after screw none of them were I found new bags with more screws but they didn't work either it just added to the confusion I felt lost scared and alone but his Hope was beginning to forsake me wait no way I tried this screw like eight times why is it working this time neat now the next couple of steps we're gonna skip because we don't have water cooling boxes that we need to install and I'm not going to worry too much about the HDD SSD installation either so I guess now we need to do power installation method now I actually think they forgot to mention this in the manual but I think we're gonna have to remove this cable cover for the power supply before we can actually Mount the power supply in here hello Supply wise I'm going to use this EVGA 650 G3 because well it's the power supply I don't have in another system at the moment now the next step is water cooling installation and apparently it only supports 240 millimeter radiator and I immediately ran into an AIO compatibility issue because the radiator is mounted on one side of the case and the motherboard on the other tubing length is an issue and considering that the Deep cool AIO I wanted to use has a really tall pump block it wouldn't fit through the only hole close enough for the tubing to reach which meant I had to use a different AIO hey that fits very nicely oh no way what which neatly led me to problem number two do they expect you to just Mount the radiator flush to the side of the case but there's nowhere for the air to go I I don't know that feels a little bit weird but at the same time I think that's kind of hilarious so I feel like I need to mount it to the side of the case just to see what happens for science I guess in the instructions they literally show the radiator mounted flush against the case so yeah I don't know I'm not one to argue with instructions I I guess I just gotta do it like that wow this feels really dumb but it's what the instructions told us to do so I guess we don't have a choice actually no never mind you can clearly see a hole for air to go through here so yeah I don't see any problems here nice that looks perfectly safe next it's time for motherboard installation method so after successfully installing the back panel device install the computer motherboard otherwise the back panel device cannot be installed okay so considering that our back device has been successfully installed I guess it's time for the front device wow it's getting really heavy wait I just realized that they don't give you enough standoffs they were just seven in the Box I don't know that's fine it's not like I was gonna screw them all down anyway now in terms of motherboard and just Cora system I'm using this Asus x570 board with a ryzen 7 3700x in it I've also got a two terabyte SSD and 16 gigs of ddr4 3200 megahertz I think this system is a perfect test victim for this cooling configuration wait these definitely aren't the correct screws because look at how loose I'm gonna lose the motherboard still is I feel like it was quite reasonable of me to assume these were the screws I needed to use considering that they were the only screws in the bag with the standoffs but apparently no and there was even the same amount of those screws as standoffs I like how much effort they put into motherboard clearance from the back panel like you can fit a whole finger in there and I feel like they definitely prioritized the correct clearance to worry about thank you now next up is GPU installation method luckily it supports all GTX 30 series cards which is convenient considering that I'm going to install a GTX 3060 in this system next we need to install the wire hidden box and then finally I think we just need the glass installation there's no way that's correct this has to be an id10t problem oh I guess that's what these little rubber gaskets are for oh there we go that's so much better wow I feel like that's a very sturdy case nice look at that foreign the CPU is already at 61 degrees Celsius well it's starting out promising uh the CPU is sitting at about 65-ish degrees Celsius but it's an AIO so it means that all of the liquid in the radiator still needs to heat up and I think once that gets thermally saturated the Pieces Just Gonna explode the crazy thing is I spent the next 50 minutes playing Battlefield 5 waiting for something catastrophic to happen and it just never did okay well it's been an hour and somehow the temperature hasn't increased I don't know what's happening it doesn't make any sense to me that this hasn't exploded yet yo I guess those be quiet silent Wing fours defy the laws of physics that's the only that's the only thing that makes sense here now it's not going super well considering that a 3700x being cooled by a Shadow Rock slim 2 hits about 57 degrees Celsius while playing Battlefield 5 but still it didn't explode now not being quite satisfied with it not exploding I decided to run some cinebench for two hours two hours later now it's officially been two hours and we're still going strong if it hasn't caught fire yet I don't think it's going to it doesn't make any sense but clearly having perforation behind a radiator is just communist propaganda now after this mind-blowing realization I did also remount the radiator using standoffs to get a little bit of clearance for some breathing room which was a massive pain in the butt because you have to remove the entire motherboard first before being able to remove the radiator which led to about 10 degrees lower temperatures while running cinebench and with that what did we learn in today's video well clearly ventilation is overrated and Ikea isn't the only company that makes wobbly flat pack and until the next video thank you for watching bye foreign",

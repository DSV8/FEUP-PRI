    "description": "This is the story of two different cases.  The first one is called Alice and while its cheap and cool looking, it incorporates a ton of unique concepts.  The other is called Yong.  It uses a 3D printing process to create an epic chassis that may cost over $4,000 but it is one of InWin's most fascinating products ever.  A special thanks to Phanteks and Steelseries for sponsoring our trip.  Without them none of this coverage would be possible.

    "transcript": "well the hello good people today is another day let's go to nan gang but we have a little surprise so today I'm Dimitri for the day so I'm gonna be covering all the cases and I will be Michael so I'll be taking all the notes actually I take also notes we can be a hybrid will be a hybrid even what are you gonna be he's gonna go check out lenses all over the place probably let's go check it out by huge thanks to Phanteks and SteelSeries for sponsoring our complex visit what's up guys I'm Dmitry and this is Alice Alice my friends is a new enclosure series that Inwin is launching not only do they have one unique element that is the fabric that is the skirt that is the the coat of the enclosure it is also made entirely of plastic ok entirely plastic as the frame itself but the metal pieces are the motherboard tray and a power supply / hard drive cage that is a concept that's so bizarre to me a plastic enclosure but were they thinking but it's $39 so it's an expensive and they're almost like trying to compete with IKEA lights it's kind of big you can populate a light bulb in there that they actually did that they put a light bulb inside this case there's like a light bulb mount inside of it that's guys cool we're thinking how awesome would it be to have something like this beside your nightstand or in your living room and especially because the fabric customization is kind of cool so they will ship with one pattern but the whole Japanese flowers and different unique colors solid colors different textures different like the possibilities are really cool and you're able to just buy one frame it comes available and like blue orange red white this kind of wooden color we were hoping there was really something more premium like aluminum frame itself or maybe wood parts somewhere else but I guess they're trying to see if the whole fabric scene will stick and I'm really hoping that it will we got to do the selfie so what do you guys think of Alice is this a concept that you would actually buy yourself the thing is when you look at something like that and the wood I put it on my desk beside my fancy monitor beside all my gaming gear probably not and that's maybe not exactly what this case is designed for especially at the lower price point cheaper materials but the whole attractive point is that fabric customization were you able to choose something that suits your interior or something like that still supports a 360 at the bottom and 120 at the top and a standard ATX motherboard and you can make it look pretty clean like the whole thing is exposed all these sections and the only button would be the power button everything else in terms of the i/o is accessible by the motherboard so there is no like additional USB ports you plug in so yeah that is Alice let us know if you think this concept is cool ridiculous would you buy something like it I would like to hear well well hello there again wow these angles are real cool now this my friends this is what we're here to see every time at Computex or CES Inwin's like here's our new signature chassis that is very expensive and accessible to everybody and it's always very unique but this time if the fabric thing was cool this is and on a completely next level so what you see here in front of me are 3d printed models of cases whoo-hoo who knew so these are like miniatures so why don't we move over to the purple one that looks absolutely amazing in winds really going with plastic this year we were hoping to see aluminum but plastic first of all it looks amazing based on the paint job and allows you to actually 3d print something that is completely unique so really cool what they're showing a demo behind us of like you'll be able to go into the software customize the color and the shape to be able to drag some sliders and the the shell will warp into something else and you can have yourself a completely completely unique frame it's what anyone's known for like that signature look the catch all right the catch is there it's $4,000 no big deal right $4,000 but you have something that like I would totally rock this purple color so this is another example of like different color customization and the actual shape and I really like this approach even though this is not something that I'll ever be able to purchase or ever actually need but as a as a centerpiece for your hardware and just doing something different within the industry I really appreciate what Inwin's doing with the signature chassis especially this year where's Lyle today I don't know thank God yeah exactly he's probably you know I don't know defiling my sheets what do you think of the this thing that you can I think it it looks scary I feel like in my saw it in my house in the middle of the night with very low lighting it would freak me out and I'd call the cops but in pure light it looks really interesting I think it's definitely a statement piece what I told Johnny the rep was that it looks like something that you would see in like multi-billionaires house yeah like this is what a multi-billionaire it stills it you you get it and you want to just troll all your friends so you put an ITX motherboard in there and be like who cares about the hardware the case cost more like when you open up like like a clam and there's like very little meat inside that would be like the perfect perfect analogy and now my friends we got something totally different so this is the Inwin 309 we originally saw this at CES and that was kind of like a mess with a white plastic piece now that's changed it to black so all the colors really pop and it's a tempered glass which is awesome now the whole idea behind this is to just give you customization options on the exterior illumination and I appreciate that they're doing something different and we haven't really seen anything like it from other case brands this is the Inman 309 the bad thing is that it's $230 the enclosure itself it's based on the three years three Chasse and unfortunately the front panel is not compatible with a three or three because the mounting holes are different but here you can set it to like night light candlelight here I'm gonna I'm gonna move out of the way so you can notice so it came to light so nice little actually I think this is a microphone based we have the sky so little pixels moved here and there gives you a bit of a unique perspective on that front panel you really wouldn't know that this is an enclosure if you're looking from the front but we have music it's based on whatever it's playing you got some vertex so that is cool how about how about check this out there are no games unfortunately but we got twinkle Time Tunnel yeah that is awesome like see the color that pops my friends we have easy EGC okay that is cool bounce oh nice and we should really wrap it up before G.Skill really can believe things over the audio and I lose my voice",

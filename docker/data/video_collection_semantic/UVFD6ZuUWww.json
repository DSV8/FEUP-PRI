    "transcript": "ha I remember the NR600 series so the original N600 was one of my favorite cases under $100 so we're checking out the NR600 sort of budget $80 mint hour which follows a similar front panel design as the rest of the end serious cases well look what we have here some Harbor connect stuff filters but that's for another case and I'm really curious to see what Coolermaster has done with this series are they improving on it or are they just digging themselves in a hole now the good thing about this enclosure is that it's only six to nine dollars so it isn't within that budget territory competing with the likes of the P350X for example and like the H500 from NZXT so is this thing any good let's find out right dudes hello I'm looking for some fans well are you married yeah I have a ring what is your favorite number I would say 3 do I have the perfect fan for you this is the new thermal tech ring trio 12 fans with good static pressure for radiators it is a beautiful frame with double side and center ring illumination with soft and super bright spill with razor chrome and compatibility control it through your smartphone the RGB plus software on the PC or Amazon Alexa well I'm gonna take these home perhaps you should to check them out in the description below alright so what we have here with the NR 600 is cool masters attempt to compete with the P 350 X and the NZXT HR hundred because physically it kind of reminds me of those two cases so on the exterior for example the whole boxy approach is very reminiscent of the NZXT th 500 while the built-in power supply shroud into the actual frame and reducing the tempered glass side panel size is that what the P 350 X is known for it is a little bit boring I'm not gonna lie but if you're going for the whole subdued and simple aesthetic here you have the NR600 and the only physical differentiations between this case and many others would be the tiny little punched in cooler master shape on the power supply out at the back and of course the ventilated front mesh panel without glossy section on the right and so this mesh I would say is the star of the show cause there's nothing blocking airflow there's not even a dust filter behind the mesh that is kind of your built in dust filter if you may it is metal and it will allow majority of the airflow versus what you'll see with many other cases that have some sort of metal mesh and a dust filter so that's a good thing that's for cooling we have two fans included one in the front one in the rear and for the front installation you can do up to a 360 or 280 milliliters up here and the power supply shroud section of the front is cut out enough usual three inches so you can fit the radiator and the set of fans and because the fans are installed outside of the frame because there is no dust filter up there you could do push and pull which is pretty nice also I will say I'm disappointed at the build quality of the front panel the frame itself is plastic and only the mesh is metal so there is plenty of flex going on as you can see and that's for the top you can do dual 120s or 140mm fans and interestingly the dust filter comes not installed by default it's actually magnetic and attached to the side panel so I would recommend installing it to allow for better air pressure to that hole like from the front to the back and it's not exactly radiator friendly up there simply because that entire cooling section is moved all the way to the back and there isn't that much clearance between the motherboard the i/o here is pretty basic with dual USB three power reset button and a combo mic / headphone jack both side panels use thumb screws for the mount and I appreciate the dual step procedure for the tempered glass removal first you have to pull it out and then angle it and remove the little hinges at the bottom so you could install the tempered glass panel without using thumb screws now as for the interior for 69 bucks we're not expecting miracles and I'm kind of glad that there is no sophistication going on it's pretty roomy interior so if you are installing anything in the front for radiators there's plenty of space until you hit the ATX area but of course if you're not installing anything in the front then that whole section looks kind of empty that's for the power supply shroud we have three SSD locations and I actually appreciate cooler masters approach to completely tool is designed here so you insert these rubber pegs into these holes and mount these little excerpt I guess from the SSD or three and a half inch drives and you simply put the the into the rubber peg very simple to install and you can maneuver your drives all around the enclosure so there's two spaces the back three on the power supply shroud but we also have this individual drive cage for three and a half inch units that you install with these individual caddies the good thing is it does not interfere with any potential radiator that you might slide however it is riveted so it is non removable which may cause issues with your power supply so if your power supply is anything longer than 160 millimeters then you will not be able to fit the power supply and your cables and I'm guessing its riveted so it could provide structural rigidity to the frame itself but it is a big limitation for longer power supply units and especially if you're not using any three and half inch drives then that whole space is completely unutilized and you cannot even stash any cables into it because it completely blocks whatever is the front of the power supply all right I think it's time for the build sequence I'm kidding this is in slow motion and so outside of that hiccup with the power supply mounting because of the extension on the frame I don't know why they can't just simply cut it out so you could simply slide the power supply in without needing to jam it in the assembly procedure was pretty straightforward kind of what I would expect from a $69 case but yeah no real issues over here and that's for temperatures compared to my most three recent case reviews the CPU temperature is pretty on par versus like the P600 s so that's a good thing but the GPU gets a little bit toasty and I'm guessing it's because the front fan while it is right and centered they're delivering more of that fresh air for the GPU I guess it doesn't deliver as much air as the other cases as for system noise levels the side and front profiles are actually pretty identical and it is like the quieter on the side versus like the fantex p6 from s for example which is a good thing but from the front it is slightly louder because of course that whole mesh thing is open and because the fan is right against the mesh it does create a little bit more turbulent noise profile but otherwise it's a pretty quiet case with full rpm as you can hear it is going right now and yeah that's pretty good and so in conclusion I feel like the NR600 is very much needed case for the $69 price point because they need to compete with the likes of fan tanks and NZXT and I would say the HR hundred it would be like my favorite in terms of build quality because this one feels a little cheap in the front plastic panel and all that steel here is quite thin and when you're working with it it does feel kind of cheap but in terms of like the airflow perspective and noise profile it is pretty decent the P 350 X from fan tanks does give you a little bit more visual candy with that light bar on the side and the front while here you could spice things up because the front mesh and the interior is totally visible from the front and of course because a temple a side panel you could experiment with some interior lighting so that it would be visible on the exterior as well and so I'm not disappointed but I was hoping for a little bit more just so that it could bring it above the competition because right now as it stands doesn't really do anything different or better versus the rest of the cases but at least it is not an airflow hazard and that makes me happy all right guys let me know what you think of the NR600 in the comments below if you recall the original N600 with that whole side fan profile I wish they could revive that and just modify the frame to meet the modern expectations but instead we have this I'm Dimitri thanks so much for watching we'll see you in next video",

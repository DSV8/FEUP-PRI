    "transcript": "- Hey guys it's Justine and look who's in my kitchen! - It is I, Joey Graceffa. You said we're making a cake, and I said, \"Oh god.\" (Justine laughing) \"For doing it again.\" (upbeat music) - Thanks so much to YouTube Originals for sponsoring this video, I can't wait for you guys to see this season. (upbeat music) We've got these pre-made things and we're gonna make an Egyptian pyramid today. - I'm down. - Getting them to stick together and then icing this, I don't know what's gonna happen. So I have a few little things here, we've some got icing, this might actually be moldy, does icing get moldy? - How about you taste it, and if you die in, like, five minutes, then I'll know, oh oops. - Oh, is this like a challenge like on \"Escape the Night\" like when you guys buried me in a coffin? Or who knows what happened in this new season? - Oh, time for the promo, guys. If you didn't know, \"Escape the Night All Stars\" season four is coming out July 11th. I don't know when you're posting this but. - I don't either. - I'm here to save you guys, okay? - Save us, you killed us! - Joey killed all these bitches, am I next? - Prepare to beg. - We're at a museum of the dead, once the sun rises, if we're not outta here, we're all gonna turn to dust. (dramatic music) - Justine is back for vengeance, she's ready to fight for her life a second time. - If you guys didn't know, Joey buried me in a coffin alive. I mean, it wasn't necessarily you, but it was still your doing. - Some would also say that I fought for you to not be put in that coffin if you, well, you weren't there 'cause you were put in the coffin. - Yeah I was dead I was dying. - But I was crying. I was sad that you died. - Now, we're going to decide who's going in the coffin and be buried alive. - [Man] Oh my goodness, this is terrible. Oh my goodness. - Justine. - No, you guys, why would you guys do this to me! - [Crowd] Hey, wait, no! We need you! (Justine screaming) Get her! Oh my god you guys! Got her! Get her! - You don't understand. You can't do this to me! - Guys, stop! No! We can't do this! C'mon! - [Crowd] We have to! (crowd arguing) - (Screaming) Joey, don't let them do this! - This is sick! (coffin closing shut) - Guess what? It's an eye for an eye, Justine. (muffled crying and screaming) - Thank you for having me back. - You're welcome. - I can't wait to watch the whole season. - What's gonna happen to Justine? - I don't know? Oh, I'm so excited Roe is on too my buddy. - Yes, I know, perhaps an alliance? Who knows? - Maybe. Or maybe not? - (gasps) Oh. - There's a little bit, oh, spoiler, there's a little bit of an alliance obviously. My girl Roe. But I thought it'd be really fun, sort of in that whole theme, to make a pyramid. - It's like a museum vibe, and you can see from the trailer there's some mummies involved, mummies, pyramids. - Does it go hand in hand? I'm not sure, probably. - I think so. - I thought so. Hmmm. - I have an idea! What if we cut these into strips. - Yeah? - Almost like bricks, to like, make it. - What if we are off on our cutting and measurements? 'Cause I'm not an Egyptian pyramid builder by any means. - Oh, you have me here. - All right, well, let's get started! - Okay, I need, do you have a machete? - Of course I have a machete. - Can you go get your machete? - Yes! - She's like, \"I thought you'd never ask!\" - I love when people ask about my machete. - I was kind of half joking about that. Oh! - It's funny, the last time I used this-- - Was when you killed someone? Okay, I don't think this is gonna work. - Yeah, I'm sorry. - Unless I just go! - No! This is a little less fun. - Oh! Oh wow, yeah. - Yeah, the machete is made more for like hacking up things. I definitely think this might be, oh, ugh. I think it might be moldy. - Really? Is there an expir-- - What is that smell? It smells like poison. - It does kinda smell a little poison-y. - Alrighty, so this is looking good. How are things over there for you? - Well, I thought it was gonna be a lot quicker. I'm still on my first Rice Krispy. Oh yeah. - Oh this is nice, I think I might add, like, some-- - Ooh, yeah, add some-- - [Joey And Justine] Some gold! - Oh, I love your apron by the way! - Oh, this old thing? Thanks! Hmm. - Okay, so now we're here. - I think, we're done. - I mean, if we cut off half of this, make this a square, then we just build this up, add some more, we've got this extra stuff over here, and then we just kinda cement it all together, and then just shave it down into a pyramid. - Okay. - That's a square, oh my god, you've got a hacksaw. Oh my god, I wish I had my chainsaw hooked up. - Same. Oh my gosh, I didn't know Rice Krispies were so-- - Yeah, this is industrial. - Firm, but this is a sharp knife. I wouldn't expect anything less from-- - Oh, no, no, no we sharpen our knives every Wednesday. - Honestly, I don't know the hell people made pyramids. That just shocks me. - We can't even think about it, let alone build it. - Okay, so now we're just building it up higher which basically, we've just put these together like this. - Right? - And we can get higher and higher. - I think that in theory this was a great idea. - I have not given up yet. - This could be good because even if this isn't entirely like a straight pyramid we can just keep building onto it. - Yeah! Let's do that. - Okay. - Oh my gosh! She's getting on the counter with a knife. Don't try this at home kids! - Do not do anything that we're doing today. How's that look? - Let's see, okay. - Cuttin' off there. (screaming and gasping) - Oh my god! Okay, this is a bad idea. - Yeah, it's a really bad idea, I'm gonna get down. I'm not cut, I'm not injured. - I'm feeling confident about this, it's turning around. - Yeah, yeah, look it! - Yes, look! - Nice! - Okay, so, we started on that side by going down in a point like this. So let's do that again. This is wild. We have two very sharp knives, and we're both cutting. - We're cutting each other. Thanks so much to YouTube Originals for sponsoring this video. I can't wait for you guys to see this season. - Wow! - Not bad! - Look at it from this way! - Yes! This is, this is beautiful. - Okay, so I think, next, maybe we should, like, mark it with a sharpie. Do you have a sharpie? - I've got icing. - Oh! Okay. - Just give us a nice little line. - I don't know if you'll be able to see it on camera. - We just need it for our eyes, its for our eyes, but you guys, if you happen to be able to see it as well, that's just added bonus. - Okay, so then if we do that, and we chop that off, that will give us the pyramid. - This is absolutely just brilliant! - It's a very tall and skinny pyramid, but let's get to hacking it away. - I'm gonna let you just start first to get a little start. - Oh, look at this! - Oh, that's lovely! - Oh, that was better than my original line I think. How are you at (mumbles)? How are you at pyramid building in \"Escape the Night\"? - I forgot about that. I don't wanna talk about it. I'm so excited for you guys to see this season. All star season, come on now. - We had a scary moment though, where, well, there were multiple scary moments, but a non, like, scripted scary moment was when the power went out. - Yes! - Oh my god. - And it's crazy because you shoot this, it is actually in the middle of the night, so you shoot all night long, and it really is such an experience. Yeah, there's windows. I thought that we would have, like, a view up here? - Ooh, how gorgeous! You know what? They should have installed windows. - What were they thinking? Gosh, can you just imagine building this for real? I'm hacking. - The pyramid is done. - It is. - Well. - Well, the shape, a shape. - I feel like we need to zhuzh her up. We need her to be a little more, do you have sandpaper? I'm really impressed. - Me too. - I was not expecting this. - I wasn't either, and I mean it looks so good. I feel like we don't need the icing, but I mixed this up. We're gonna use it. Would you like one of these? - Nah. Just get on in there girl. - Wow! Wow! See, I wanna go for a nice, smooth look. - Are you saying my hands aren't smooth? (Justine laughing) This is how you get in all the nooks and crannies. Oh yeah. - This actually feels really nice. You want a little scrubba dub dub? - Heck yes. - Do you need some more over here? - Do we like it with the frosting or without? - I think I like it actually. I think it looks pretty good. We kind of make it look like bricks using this. Like this. See? - Yes! Yes! (upbeat music) No, no, no, no, no. - What? - No, no, no, no, no. - Am I in trouble? - Girl, this looks like a freakin' corn on the cob. (Justine laughing) If this was a real structure, this whole thing would be tumbling down. - It does look like corn on the cob. I was just, you know, thinkin' about corn. So, I see what you're saying. - Okay. Yeah. - Wow, it looks a little less corn on the cobby. - Oh, thank god. So now, should we add in some accents with the gold? Oh, maybe we fill in the lines with it. - Yes, I love that. That is a good idea! - Okay here, you do that. - Okay. - I'm gonna go wash this hand. Oh, yeah! - Yup! God, I wish we would have built this before I was on \"Escape the Night\". I could have learned a thing or two So where can everybody find the show? - So, \"Escape the Night\" season four, well, all \"Escape the Nights\" on my channel right now. You can see one through three for free, and then season four is probably out now, if it's past July 11th, it's out now. So if you guys don't know what the show is, basically it's like a giant escape room for YouTubers, but we're interacting with actors who know what's going on. A lot of people think that we're acting, but we're not. - No! - We have no idea what's happening. - None. You're basically thrown into a massive escape room, but it's, like, real life. - And then we have to vote against each other each episode. - Yeah, I don't like that part 'cause. - Two people go into a final death challenge, and only one makes it out alive. I'm so impressed with this. - Me too. Oh my gosh we did something right! - Wow! We still need to add some torches. - You're right, oh my gosh, okay, wait. We should, do we, okay I've got torches. Let's see. Ooh, we've got some gold! - Oh, the gold ones. - We could do this. And then jam a few of them in there. (upbeat music) Yeah then light some torches. Is it going in there? - Yeah. - Cool. Oh my gosh, it is so beautiful. - This is? - I can't believe it! Do we need anything else? - [Joey And Justine] Wow! - This is like \"Legends of the Hidden Temple\". Do you remember that show? - Abso-freakin-lutely. - Oh my goodness! - I wanted to be on that show so bad. - Well guys, thank you so much for watching. This is our incredible pyramid that we made in honor of \"Escape the Night\" season four. It'll be on Joey's channel. I'll put all of the links in the description below. Anything else you'd like to tell them about the show? - Just there's a lot of drama this season. - A lot of drama. - A lot. So if you wanna see some of your favorite YouTubers die, make sure you go check it out! - Yay! Well, thanks so much. This was so much fun! - Yeah, thank you! - Do you wanna take it home? I can put it in a little Ziploc bag for you. - You know what? I'll leave it here for you. (upbeat music)",

    "transcript": "it's because of purchases like this, listed as 'broken terrible Predator pre-built' off of eBay that the CRA must be convinced I'm either terrible at laundering money or my credit card was stolen by a 13-year-old Romanian child hopped up on pixie sticks. Either way, luckily I have some help for my terrible spending habit. today's video is sponsored by Lexar... 's doubleteaming of your memory requirements. SSD, Ram from Lexar is absurdly fast NM 790 nvme drives to their Aries ddr5 that's available in speeds up to 7,200 MHz. Lexar has your high-end gaming memory needs covered so if you're in the market for some theic memory bandwidth check out Lexar using the link in the video description thank you Lexar for sponsoring today's video [Music] now the point of today's video is to see if I can get this Predator working and then maybe get some exciting hardware for a good deal out of it which I mean the starting point isn't particularly exciting so I I don't know how likely that is but the last time I did one of these I did get a Dell Cronenberg 380 out of it and some alien wear so who knows maybe it'll be fine [Music] wow that is a prostate chattering pile of crap and by that I mean it's it's very big it's a piece of crap that's large so it it'll hurt possing it it's also pretty dusty so not particularly fresh oh wo it's also super [Music] heavy and there she is uh I can't remember anything about this system I don't know what specs are in here or if they even listed a potential cause of failure for it I bought it ages ago uh but it seems pretty complete like I can see storage from here graphics card Ram there's there's a power supply in there the sticker on the front also says it's got some i7 in it is that more concerning or less concerning that there isn't stuff missing but I guess the first thing we need to do is see if it works maybe they just forgot to plug it in or sumone okay oh well it's reacted to me just plugging it in which I guess is a good sign things are lighting up which means nothing's exploded [Music] maybe okay so there's no signal I then tried different outputs on the graphics card and smashing some keys on a keyboard for some reason okay so as is expected we're not getting a signal out of the system it would have been really weird if it just worked now aside from the no signal thing uh the system isn't giving us a whole lot of information here this motherboard doesn't seem to have a post LED code readout thing so it's not going to give us any specific feedback on what the issue is which I guess means we're going to have to do this the old fashion way with some good old brute forcing it's a nice glass mechanism now on the inside of the system aside from some very hastily wiped down dust on top of our ice tunnel here there isn't anything immediately telling me something's broken in here now I'm going to assume for now for the time being that the power supply is okay because the system did light up power did go into it uh it doesn't mean that the power supply isn't broken but I I think it's unlikely at this point I've also had a look at things like RAM and the graphics card everything seems to be seated decently on the note of the graphics card we do get an RTX 370 ooh uh so I guess gu that means CPU wise this is like a 12th gen i7 at this point I don't know why but my guts telling me that this PCI Riser cable is the problem it it it's not based in any logic it's just my gut rumbling at me and and I'm very suspicious of that but before we replace this let's try the ram out because the behavior that we see on Startup could also be something like defective memory so let's swap this Domino's Pizza Ram out for something we know works and see if that helps oh 16 gigs of ddr5 this system must have been wildly expensive when it first came out oh and I know of just the ram to replace it with some Lexar baby yeah there you go but unfortunately not even Lexar ddr5 could revive the system okay well now it's time to listen to my gut and rip out that Riser cable so let's do that but to get to the Riser cable first I had to undo a complex network of screws to get the bracket out I guess the whole thing oh there's another screw in here that holds the whole bracket in and then you pull it out oh wait but it's stuck on the ice tunnel is the I think this is oh damn okay well that's gone into the infinite abyss of Madness so let's remove our ice tunnel oh look at that the ice tunnel's just a Dusty bracket so can I get the graphics card out now yeah and with the graphics card free I could finally remove the Riser cable now when it comes to the Riser cable it looks fine there's no obvious signs of terrible things having happened to it but it's quite plasticky and I feel like this is the kind of thing that fails quite easily wait how hard is it it to remove this graphic Scot from that bracket maybe I can just plug it straight into the motherboard okay no never mind the graphics card looks like it's chemically bonded with this bracket so this is the replacement Riser cable I've used it before I know it works that's so dumb oh my word now I'm not sure why my knee-jerk reaction was of such outrage but obviously there's mounting clearance issues very nice which meant I had no choice but to undo the million screws holding the graphics card into its erection bracket which with a stripped screw almost ended in disaster oh yeah there we go the lenus screwdriver worked like a charm there but then there's still the front bit that is separate for some reason but after removing the front piece of the bracket I could drop the graphics card straight into the motherboard like God intended but the system still wouldn't post okay well I guess my was wrong the system still isn't posting so I dropped a known working graphics card into the system which unfortunately also didn't give us a signal out but that's also not giving us a signal out Okay so we've identified that the ram wasn't the issue and neither was the graphics card so now it's starting to get a little bit more complicated I think the next thing we need to do is pull out the CPU in fact the last time I did one of these videos with an alien wear system there just wasn't a CPU in the system so I don't know maybe maybe that's the case this time too let's give it let's give it a look see oh would you look at that this time there is actually a CPU in here that's very exciting uh but maybe it's a dead CPU so it might not be that exciting and if that doesn't work then we may have a little bit of a bigger issue physically I guess I don't know if you really care about that motherboard being dead or not [Music] I mean there's no obvious damage to the pads on the base of the CPU and the socket also looks fine a 12 700k nice so after 40 minutes of digging through old systems I finally managed to find another 12 gen Intel chip so hopefully this one works let's drop it in and see what happens it also didn't work basically the only two components of any significance that we haven't changed yet is the motherboard and the power supply now again I'm leaning towards it not being the power supply because power supplies fail quite spectacularly I don't think this would be happening if that power supply exploded at some point which leaves us with just the motherboard which is annoying cuz it's going to be a lot of effort to remove having said that it does look like a standard matx motherboard so we should be able to keep all of the components in this case which doesn't matter too much this case is about as desirable as it leech to the eyeball but we're trying to see how much we can salvage here now the first thing I want to do before I decide whether or not to keep this case equivalent of your child deciding to study drama is I do want to see what kind of front panel connectors we have cuz it's kind of hidden under this and if I can't use the power button then it's just going in the trash like my child's Dreams yeah so hopefully this isn't some dumb proprietary piece of craft well it looks fine so I guess little Timmy gets to cripplingly indebt himself for some theater wow that Samsung SSD just folded in a half when I pulled it out because of the glue on the thermal pad it it seems to have kind of reset fine hopefully it's okay [Music] okay there we go it's free I must have overtightened the the aiio block when I remounted it because when I tried to loosen it it just snapped that bracket off that's wild but here is our pre-built motherboard in all its Glory honestly not a terrible looking board at least we've got reasonable power delivery and like cooling for it and stuff uh but at this point I think this is our most likely culprit otherwise what do we have left of the power supply it's going to going to be the power supply isn't it now the motherboard in question is this strix z690 board which is also matx so that we can keep that weird tiny motherboard in huge case aesthetic that HP wants for some reason [Music] mounting the AIO was a bit of a nightmare because the acch mounting bracket that I used had slightly shorter screw threading than the HP bracket which meant I had to apply massive pressure to the quivering screw which didn't quite want to align with the bracket well well that sucked now at this point it's an entirely different PC aside from the power supply hopefully the power supply wasn't the issue all along and destroys all of these new components now the reason that I'm going to test it like this is to see if it works and then I'll slowly swap the old components back in like the old CPU Ram graphics card to see which of those components works and then hopefully at the end of the day we've just had to replace the motherboard thing but the power button does work a few moments later okay there we go it's posted it would have been very worrying if it didn't post uh but so there we have a functional system which again is not surprising considering that this is a completely different PC at this point but now we can start swapping things back in there we go the 12 700k works now with the graphics card I decided to test it in its erection bracket with the Riser cable again because be oh no we're not getting a signal out no way I think the GP is also dead no oh this GPU is dead I got super screwed with this system uh but maybe maybe my gut was correct let's remove it from the bracket get that Riser cable out of the way and hope pray that the GPU is still [Music] working oh oh oh thank gab that works wow that would have really sucked if the GPU didn't work anymore and once I confirmed the ram working it meant that the only dead component in the system was the motherboard which means I still didn't get a whole lot for my money but we'll talk about that in a bit because there was an interesting surprise with the windows installed and now that this is all running we also get to see which of the two ssds work and how big they are oh they're two 512 gig NVM drives yeah I mean these days you can buy these for like $40 new and that's the way you should buy them you really shouldn't buy them used so I wouldn't really count this as added value but we can see what kind of Windows install it has on it I mean who knows maybe there's some Bitcoin on it that would be cool that's a very weird wallpaper for a system to have on it kind of makes me think was this used in like an Esports tournament I don't know the fact that there's only Rainbow Six Siege Discord TeamSpeak and a bunch of drivers for different peripheral brands on this system it really looks like a system that was set up for use in an Esports tournament more specifically the Berlin major of 22 cool so with that let's see how our Pro Gamer machine runs cyberpunk yo so Pro Gamers play on like butt cheeks PCS that's crazy so it's cyberpunk at 1080p High settings low and behold our RTX 370 with 12 700k is running very well we're hovering around 120 frames per second with a very smooth frame time graph temperatures are also great the system is quite noisy but that's just because of the the fan profiles uh currently on the motherboard and luckily we have a lot of Headroom for temperature so we can definitely make that be quieter uh the graphics card also 64 C on that little Abomination HP card is pretty good uh but I've just started playing so I'm I'm going to run around for a while and and we'll we'll see what the temperatures do over time so it's been a while and the temperatures aren't going anywhere we're still looking at 63 C on the GPU and in the 50s on the CPU very impressive and considering that the only dead component we received was the motherboard I think it worked out pretty well but considering that I paid $750 us for the system not including shipping then um well it it didn't go great uh yeah which brings me to the end of the video for the next video I'm going to have my first ever experience with VR I'm really excited to vomit buckets subscribe to the channel if you don't want to miss that and yeah until then thank you for watching bye-bye [Music]",

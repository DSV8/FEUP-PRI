    "transcript": "oh my god imagine if Corsair would release a golden gaming headset yeah that would never happen RG Beto am i right yep the microphone is legit it is so fancy so this is the Corsair virtuoso RGB wireless man virtuoso what a name so there's the SE or special edition version with aluminum sides and then there's the non SE model and the price Delta between the two is $40 the three main differences between the two include a bigger microphone aluminum side plates instead of nasty gloss and a carry pouch is included with the SE RGB on the sides is of course free and so is the service from today's sponsor privacy.com that keeps your mind at ease from credit or debit card theft with the use of their virtual cards so you never share your personal information when making purchases online more on that later so I have to give Corsair props for such a well-built headset it's very simple with aluminum joints sturdy sais extensions that are numbered and they don't even have the Corsair text on the headband like we see from them all the time the only branded thing is the Corsair logo cut out on the sides on the SE there using this micro perforation for the RGB that look like pixels very unique while the non SE has this traditional but much brighter illumination with your usual full color palette to choose from the problem on this micro perforation is literally dirt clogged up because the holes are so tiny and because this whole like aluminum side is circular the dirt ends up finding its way into the center and clogs up those pixels or micro perforation and no way to really clean this thing you could turn off the illumination by lowering brightness to zero in the settings but this is an example of QC gone wrong during the design process however I do appreciate their commitment to cohesive design elements across the USB dongle the type-c cable and the serious microphone with that awesome dotted pattern now comfort wise the headset is light enough without excessive clamping force so glasses are not an issue I do like the low profile rotation of the ear cups to rest on your neck it's super awesome for a wireless pair the padding is memory foam like unfortunately the driver wall is completely flat and not angled or curved in any way to avoid contact with your ears so for me both ears are making contact with that internal wall making wearing this headset not very comfortable the good thing is the clamping force is pretty neutral so it's not pressing against my ears but I still prefer thicker padding or some sort of curved or angled or angled or Wow or angular section on that internal wall now for controls we have a smooth volume wheel with great resistance below that is the wired or wireless switch that also acts as your power button when in the latter position on the opposite side is the USB type-c port that is used for charging or using the headset in Wired mode plus we also have that 3.5 millimeter analog port to use with controllers or smartphones and then there's the mini USB port for the removable microphone so on the SE the omnidirectional microphone is nine point five millimeters pretty massive you can mute it with a button under the mic that then turns the illumination ring red and that is always in your peripheral vision so you can see when the mic is muted when it's on and we also have voice prompts in case you want to hear when you do mute the microphone and when the microphone is unmuted we do not have any noise cancellation options in the software aside from your mic volume and side tone and unfortunately despite them calling this broadcast quality I feel like at lacks clarity and it sounds a bit closed off despite having pretty decent bass it is kind of muddy and the funny thing is what you listen to now is that recorded by this smaller microphone the non SE version and this one sounds more natural to me with the extra clarity great vocal pickup it's not as muddy or bass heavy as the big one so let me know which one sounds best to you in the comments and just to establish a quick baseline comparison this is the GSP 500 from Sennheiser it is a wired headset but I use as the benchmark for gaming headset microphone audio I think it's the most natural in terms of vocal pickup great bass great clarity and the Corsair is not too far off from it with a small microphone but the se microphone sounds much worse as for my performance in the USB mode it is cleaner and less compressed versus Wireless and you can hear that around sharp S's in particular kind of disappointing as Corsair slipstream is supposed to provide high bandwidth wireless communication and really improve the microphone quality on the wireless front but it does sound better in USB mode and finally let's talk audio I find it really strange that you cannot enable surround sound on the headset itself there's no like surround sound button you have to do it through the software only which is super inconvenient for a gaming headset you have to exit the game unable that in the software why but surround sound performance is actually not too aggressive with environmental expansion sounded pretty decent in control but I still would use only stereo mode for games and music and movies to the volume levels are great they're equally powerful in both wireless and wired mode I cannot hear a difference but I have been spoiled by external amp solutions that are much louder but the hundred percent volume this thing is satisfactory as for sound performance to my ears they sound pretty neutral with nice roll-off on the highlights not too harsh it's not too mellow the bass is present and control that doesn't overpower into the mid-range which is very well detailed this is the best Corsair headset that I've ever heard and this is definitely in my top 5 in the wireless pairs they actually EQ very well without distortion too so if you prefer a little extra bass kick or sharp or treble that can be done in a software when you connect this thing via USB you get 24-bit 96k Hertz fidelity sound so high resolution and there's actually a distinguishable quality difference in compression and the controlled or the detail of the bass in Wired mode which is so much better versus when it said Wireless but still it's quite decent in Wireless mode with their slipstream technology the wireless range is about 7 meters in my apartment with direct line-of-sight which is about average two other wireless gaming headsets until I start to hear interruptions and signal processing errors and the battery life is rated at 20 hours I still don't get why Corsair doesn't just give us a percentage indicator instead we have this battery status buried in the settings for some reason and personally I like everything to be transparent so let me tell you about today's sponsor privacy.com it's a free service that lets you create virtual credit cards for online merchants like Amazon Netflix iTunes and others so your real credit and debit cards stay protected in case of bridges from online merchants setting up cards is no hassle at all with the Handy span limit customization for each card so you don't worry about canceling a subscription or changing a card if one gets hacked Plus you get notified if the card is used elsewhere the service is free it's encrypted and comes with a handy Chrome extension so visit privacy com.com/HWC to get five dollar credit towards your first privacy purchase that is privacy comm / hwc alright so let me conclude with this virtuoso RGB wireless and wireless se headsets in terms of build quality they a fantastic job but I feel like the SE model I mean there's too many compromises in terms of having this dirt clogged up and the micro perforation the microphone for example sounded so much better on the non SE model I don't know why and for the $40.00 saved the only disadvantage I would say would be the glossy side I don't know why they went with the glossy size just go with the matte exterior or like choose a different texture you know be innovative and they sure were but not in the right spaces I guess and for $180 that is the model I would recommend out of the two and I'm guessing it's kind of competitor versus like the really high-end stuff in terms of audio quality like the GSP 670 $350 the artist Pro Wireless is somewhere around there too so this is basically half the price and it does sound better than whatever you can get from HyperX in the wireless department but then the main culprit here would be comfort and that internal lining and how flat it is and how close it is to the ear but everything else they pretty much nailed it the microphone quality here is so much better than the SE model the build quality is awesome the wireless range is good and battery life is what you would expect from a wireless gaming pair so yeah the non S II is my recommendation alright guys hope you guys enjoyed it make sure to check out this other relevant content subscribe for more I'll talk to you and next video",

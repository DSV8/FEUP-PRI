    "transcript": "you might recall a company called arrow cool that sponsored us tearing our copy text 2017 coverage there are a case power supply and peripheral company stationed out of Taiwan and what I have today is something we showcased while we were there a large mid tower PC case with integrated RGB lighting a tempered glass side panel and excellent ventilation so I'll be completely honest there is a lot more to this case than meets the eye and once you do realize how many things there are two kind of tinker with and get right it can be a bit overwhelming there are also several variants to choose from including non pro versions of both white and black c1 variants this here is the white p7 c1 pro model to be found in the video's description and it comes well equipped with tempered glass and a solid steel frame aesthetically speaking this case has a lot going for it now at first glance this might appear to be a full sized tower it is not by definition it is simply a mid tower it only has 7 PCI slots at the rear this also only supports ATX motherboards knotty ATX thanks to the indention on the right side of the case which is useful for cable management at the rear to large speed span the length of the case and also looked at a good bit off the ground for adequate PSU breathing room behind the glass you'll find a basement spanning the same distance all the way up to the front of the chassis where you can store up to 3 120 millimeter fans or radiator combos a large dust filter is also included and the removable front panel welcomes air with its many perforations glad to see this in a case this size speaking of which yes this case is a bit unorthodox in the sense that it's only a mid Tower and it's pretty dang tall probably one of the tallest mid towers around and I thought that at first it would not have enough room to store cables in the back panel because it doesn't look very wide it actually is pretty wide it just doesn't look wide because it's so tall so you'll find plenty of cable storage space at the rear there aren't any tie straps I wish that they had included some of those you have a few points in which to use some tie straps too and a secure cables in place but no what am I looking for velcro straps that's the word so none of those are included but I don't think you're gonna need to really take the time to write your cables there is so much space in the back of this case I think you'll be plenty happy with what you have do keep in mind though on the left side of the case where you'll be building your PC primarily there is not much space for a large CPU cooler so up to 160 five millimeters I believe is the maximum CPU cooler height anything beyond that and you will be hitting that tempered glass at the back of the case you'll find a cutout for motherboard rear i/o a 120 millimeter fan or rad mount seven PCI slots as mentioned earlier and a PSU cutout at the base I like here how arrow cools included a PCI bracket cover similar to how fantex and others keep a nice clean and concealed look just two thumb screws are not captive but they're still there we'll hold this in place remove it first to install a graphics card or two then swap it back on for that nice finish as for storage you'll find four two and a half inch drive bays as well as two three and a half inch ones the two three and a half inch ones are actually mounted to the PSU from underneath they're not mounted to the bottom of the case which is an interesting approach also you'll find two of the four two and a half inch drive bays are on top of the power supply shroud which is nice it's kind of like an NZXT s340 vibe here there is one large cutout for cable management if you want to plug in HD audio though or use that far-left SSD tray then you're gonna have to kind of let your cables just spread out over the basement a bit because there's only that one large cutout in the center I wish they'd added a second one probably one of the only major changes that I would have made to this case up top you will find a very nice array of features including a standard USB 3.0 and 2.0 layout power and reset buttons microphone and headphone jacks and also an SD card we directors two of a1 microSD and one standard SD useful especially for situations like my own where I'm constantly swapping data to and from my camera they're not the fastest card readers on the planet I believe they're using the USB 2.0 interface but it's still nice to have them there in fact the card reader I use right now is USB 2.0 face I just haven't bit the bullet yet and purchased a USB 3.0 card reader so I actually might be using this instead further back on the top panel you'll find a few grill slits for active ventilation actually of a 240 millimeter a IO up top and I was also able to squeeze two 120mm fans and so of plenty of room for cable management with the motherboard below they do a decent job and aren't too restrictive and while there is no dust filter to remove up here fans shouldn't really be said to intake anyway this will be an exhaust array now one of the selling points for the c1 Pro not just the regular c1 the pro model apart from the tempered glass which is a deviation which I like and it's slightly tinted it's not too tinted to where I'd feel just like I can't anything in there but it's nice to have tempered glass in general the second perk of going with the pro model is that you have full RGB control integration also full fan control with the included hub Eric who calls this the p7h one and it does allow for multiple RGB LED strips case integration and fan RGB integration all to be supported and controlled by a single hub here you just plug it into a USB port on your motherboard also it acts as a fan hub so the three front fans included with the p7c when these are all RGB cables so a separate wire for each of these fans plugs into the hub for RGB control and of course you also have your three pin fan headers to plug into the hub and control the fan curves there is a fourth fan included with the p7 c1 pro at the rear but it's pretty trashy honestly you want to get rid of that one it's it's very loud it doesn't do that great a job at staying quiet so it's really nice that air-cool includes the hub with the purchase of the c7p one this case is gonna run you anywhere between 150 and 200 bucks which isn't too bad I would say a sweet spot for this case would be closer towards 150 dollars think $200 is cutting it that's the upper end there but do take into account the fact that you do get the hub which is in itself maybe a twenty thirty dollar value you get for fans three of which I suggest you keep these are all RGB controllable they all have separate cables for controlling RGB functionality with the hub not and the case also has integrated RGB lighting so what I've done here I really like this case I like how much room it has being that it's only a mid Tower I can still manage to fill up most of this space with a custom loop and that's why I threw one in here now it's not finished the PDG tubing is gonna be the last part of this project and that's that's a whole project in itself but that's what I'll tackle at a future date I just wanted to show you what it would look like if you wanted to do a custom loop arrangement in here of course you don't need that though you could stick a 360 mil radiator combo up front or up top and it actually be pretty hidden too you can see you can barely even tell that there's a radiator up there with two fans because there's so much space up top which is really nice very custom loop friendly case being that it's only a mid tower arrangement and I'm looking forward to finishing this I think it's gonna be really cool by the way this is a coffee lake 8700 K CPU in here with the gigabyte c-- 370 gaming seven mother as always you can find the p7 c1 in white and black link in the video description along with their non Pro counterparts if you want to spend around 100 or so US bucks and you're not getting the tempered-glass front panel nor the hub I believe a few other things that you'll just have to look at spec wise but the cases are going to be pretty much the same form factor wise and that's what you got to keep in consideration here this is a case that is really bringing a lot to the table it's not going to be the most friendly case to build in there are a few things I would change like I said the cutout in the basement needs to be added the one on the left side I don't really like how the cables are kind of just supposed to go through the small little opening between the left and right sides of this back panel I would prefer rubber grommets that's just me personally but everything else about this case looks really good and I can't wait to turn this thing on and show you guys what it looks like what it's all powered up so stay tuned for that let me know what you think about this case in the comments below and give us my thumbs up if you're looking forward to what this pcs gonna look like when it's all said and done this is science studio thanks for learning with us",

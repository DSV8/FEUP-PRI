    "transcript": "let's talk about craigslist gaming pcs and more or less why i don't really use craigslist anymore when it comes to gaming pc ads looking for good deals bad deals whatever i just yeah i don't know it leaves kind of a foul taste in the mouth at this point but people still use it it is actually a fairly popular place to sell pcs unfortunately we've got a few good and bad ones to run through stay with me team group is hosting a launch event for their latest hot topics including heat dissipation large capacities and the latest overclocked ddr5 memory be sure to check it out by the link below where you can also enter for a chance to win a 3500 gaming pc nintendo switch and other gear the giveaway ends october 31st so jump on them while you can so why don't i like using craigslist anymore well it's kind of sort of a bit outdated i mean even on desktop it's a bit for example this ad here i mean look at this what like this is an old school more or less primitive user interface here you got tons of gaps you've got this map over here to the right which literally means almost nothing um you know the spacing the wording the whole format of this page is just no bueno and all the ads for the most part look like this so for folks like me who make videos around these ads whether they be good ones or bad ones it just doesn't work very well here's an example so you've got like my window over here right and then you've got tons of whoops backwards tons of dead space look at all that dead space it's just like and there's nothing i can do i mean you zoom in greg if i zoom in everything gets screwed up it's just it just doesn't work in fact if i'm being honest and this isn't a plug for them because we don't work with any of these companies directly offrop tends to be the one i use the most i don't really like facebook marketplace i don't know why there's just like there's always something sneaky going on facebook marketplace and then craigslist is more old school so you'll find uh typically the older generation will use craigslist um folks that just don't have a big offer up audience or maybe they live in the middle of nowhere and the facebook marketplace just isn't really vibing um then craigslist is going to be the only place that you go right you list it there or you list it in the classifieds in the newspaper that's about it so yeah i mean it's kind of sad that craigslist really hasn't innovated much in the way of their like user interface even for desktop and mobile side is also garbage in my opinion it just doesn't work offref is one of the better uh mobile platforms for a third-party resale but yeah i mean this is probably gonna be one of the last times as we look at craigslist ads so take note of it in your calendars so enough ranting let's look at the ad almost built pc look at the details 800 palm bay i'm not sure where this is i didn't really pay attention to the location uh the picture i only get one picture here i prefer more than just this one and it's taken in the vertical format which i'm not a fan of especially for a platform like craigslist which tends to be more desktop friendly it's a bit dirty you've got dust on top of the pa the power supply basement and cable management's a bit lacking only a single DIMM of DDR4 i can see their top flow cooler it needs some work it's not in uh presentation mode currently it says it has MSI mpg z490 gaming edge wi-fi okay uh 200 i7 11 700 kf hundred and thirty seven dollars t-force eight gigs of ram around fifty bucks then we'll take cpu fan 20 bucks three RGB fans and a 850 watt power supply they go for around 120 to 150. all that's missing is storage and a graphics card but every part in the computer will definitely run games on max settings okay hold on i feel like i know what this guy's trying to do he's trying to say that the components already in here are great for gaming but he's almost making it seem like this system as is will run games on mac settings and that is just not the case i mean the the core i7 that he has in here is an f skew which means it doesn't even have an integrated graphics processor which means you're not going to get any picture out if you plug an HDMI cable or Display port cable or whatever directly into the back of that motherboard so you need a discrete card for this pc to actually function and the way he's presenting this he's making it seem like it's already ready to run games and max settings that's one side of the coin he's also saying that the i7 will run games on max settings and that's i mean again very vague because what resolution what i don't know max settings but okay max settings at 720p is going to look way different than mac settings in 4k or 8k or whatever you want to play in the other thing is that he says every every part of the computer will definitely run games and max settings but that's certainly not the case if you have eight gigs of ram in it right you've already you've already taken an arrow to the knee as a gaming pc if you have eight gigs of ram in it that's it it's your your that we've already proven on this channel and other channels have done the same we've proven that eight gigs of ram is just not enough for modern gaming anymore so maybe the games he's referring to or like from a few years ago maybe a gigs is enough to run on mac settings because by that point you'll be fully saturating the frame buffer on the graphics card and i don't think system ram is going to be as leveraged but still we're not there folks i run every game with no problems at really high fps this guy's trying to like oversell it if someone tries to oversell something stay away especially if there are plenty of fish in the sea there are other gaming pcs in this area um it's not like this is the only one to choose from so when someone starts pushing something like this just i don't even really care to look at the price i don't even know if this is a good deal or not i just i'm turned off by the fact that it's presented this way and that's a problem for the seller now next on the list we actually have a pretty good one i mean it's not like killer good but it's good in this market so this here's a gaming pc tower for 350 bucks and the pictures are decent right we start off with a good shot from the left side here you can see the side panel and then we also get a shot of the rear so you can check for ports people care about that also a shot from the front and then a close-up there of the core i5 sticker so i think this one in terms of photos is presented quite nicely and then you've got a description here cpu intel core i5 3570 the gpu is a radon armor rx 574 gig and then you get an ssd and a hard disk drive i don't like the fact they didn't specify capacities here that's that's something you definitely want to do with any storage drive and then a power supply cooler master 700 watt silent pro the issue with this is like you're just asking for people to ask you questions about this right you want to you want to answer as many questions as possible that are you know that makes sense in the ad already so you don't have the same question be being asked by multiple people fishing in on craigslist or wherever right so this is just inefficient you want to specify upfront uh everything else though i mean presentation wise this case is just like ridiculously difficult cable management so i'm not going to dock him there um he's got a different power supply obviously he looks like he upgraded the graphics card and the thing about this price right 350 bucks you might be thinking well greg it looks like he just recycled an old optiplex and threw a graphics card in here i mean 350 is probably making a profit until you look at ebay listings so this is a list of the most recent RX 574 gig sales on ebay as of time of filming you can see these are all filming October 20th right so the times here should scale downward from October 20th and they're all selling for at least 200 bucks probably more than that look at this a four gig rx 570 sold for 300 this one sold for 250. this one sold for 232. another one for 250. so very consistent on the sale prices here you can see that even broken ones two of these sold for 200 bucks so they're selling broken for 100 each that's insane because a little over a year or two ago rx 574 gigs were selling used but in working condition for under a hundred dollars easy so with that in mind the price this person's asking for his Optiplex rig actually ain't all that bad so for a hundred bucks if you deduct 250 for the RX 570 you're getting a power supply you're getting two storage drives again capacities are unknown but still and you're getting a full platform memory motherboard and cpu and a case you're getting the whole enchilada that's that's really not bad at all despite this being an older platform it's still i think a pretty decent deal in this market i also notice he didn't mention system ram the capacity there would be good to know probably eight gigs let's see is four sticks in there but uh still i mean no matter how you slice this this is a pretty darn good entry level system a bit of a side story leading up into this next ad my wife and i a few weeks ago put in an offer for a plot of lance half an acre a few miles north of here now since Florida's... Florida, I can look at public records and see how much people paid for adjacent plots there's a plot right next to the one we placed a bid on that sold for 80 000 a few months ago and we're not talking like nine months ago we're talking maybe three months ago two to three months i think at the time we made our offer that lot is the same size as ours again in the same location it touches or it's right next door has the same views they're really no different so i knew going into this i wasn't going to be paying any more than about $80k or $85,000 for that lot it makes no sense right the market hasn't changed drastically in two months time two years time yeah sure but two months that that span of time really doesn't account for a serious degree of inflation or anything even though that is on the rise certainly um it's nothing that would make me think oh i've got to pay way more now for this plot that's identical to the one next to it well the people who listed the property had it listed for a hundred and fifteen thousand dollars originally it was for like 140 or 150 and they've dropped it to 115 in a matter of months so they realized that they overpriced it and the thing about this market is that nobody really cares about land right now everyone wants to buy a house they want a move-in ready home people who buy land are more in it for the long term they're going to be building so that takes several months to potential years depending on the style of the build and how you know how dragged out things get with contractors it's kind of a fiasco so if you buy a plot of land with the expectation of building it's you know you've got to be patient you've got to you've got to know that you have to be patient going into it and we made an offer of i think 75 000 for that lot knowing that my top dollar was going to be about 85 000. they didn't even bother countering they thought that their lot was made of gold and they weren't interested in negotiating with us because our offer was so insulting and despite us presenting evidence that the lot right next door had recently sold 480 000 what can you do some folks just think that their property is worth way more because they own it and that often translates into smaller things as well like gaming pcs so this here is a high performance gaming pc at least um that's what it's titled and this person wants 1200 dollars for it well i mean pictures look okay cable management looks decent you don't see too many crazy things just gonna tuck these in and uh you'll have a tidy looking build but then you get down here and you start to realize that it's mostly hype this is a great pc for people who want to have high quality and performance weather whether it comes to streaming or gaming this pc has an intel core i7 cpu with a 1650 super and can run 400 fps max recommended fps 240 to 360. what did i just read setting aside the fact that a 1650 super is definitely not a high-end graphics card suited for a high-end gaming pc i think what this owner is trying to do is leverage the core i7 as much as he can the the core i7 name has a lot of value and unfortunately people see this and they think oh it must be you know top dollar i need i need to pay top dollar for it because it's an intel core i7 but what kind of core i said you need to ask yourself what generation core i7 this is because if it's not within the last two or three generations of core i7 i mean that's a big difference there and you don't want to overpay for an older SKU so you need to do some due diligence before making an offer on top of that in this ads case there's no mention of what core i7 it is so of course you're kind of left to your own devices here i might be able to figure out what this is i mean the pictures it's a pretty low res photo i can't really see can't see what board it is it looks like the heat sink for this chipset is missing that's it's really weird it does have an m.2 slot so it's not too old but but still and it does look like there's only a single stick of either DDR3 or DDR4 i'm not sure so this is pretty this is pretty stripped down and it's definitely not worth twelve hundred dollars again this person's gonna think his build is is gold because he owns it assuming it's a guy it's probably a guy but but you know if you do any amount of research you'll know that it's not worth this and that research will save you from giving a person like this extra money that he probably doesn't deserve this ad is probably the worst one yet a 1650 super and can run 400 fps max recommend again that's just vague 400 fps in what what context what resolution what in game settings what game are you talking about there's so many variables that are left out intentionally to deceive you typical salesman tactic be weary now this one here is titled a mid-range gaming pc 600 bucks okay well if they're willing to say mid-range then they're probably somewhat sensible they're not calling this high-end and just from looking at it it doesn't look high-end this looks pretty dirty um pretty greasy dusty definitely needs a deep cleaning i do say so myself but anyway that's not why we're here this is a great mid-range gaming computer to get you jumped into pc gaming there is also an elgato hd 60 pro installed internally so it's perfect for a dual stream pc setup or for streaming slash recording games from your console i am only selling it because i have newer computer to replace it it sits inside a Thermaltake chaser MK1 full tower so there is plenty of room for you to add drives switch out parts or whatever or do whatever you want to do this is just a bunch of i don't know i didn't there are dust filters in the front and on the bottom it could definitely use some dusting oh you don't say after being moved down here across the country and sitting in storage but besides that it is good to go everything is as is this doesn't make me feel very good about it i mean does as is mean you're not guaranteeing that it works like i i don't know why you would say that if it worked because most people who say as is just means like that that just means good luck you know it's like if it doesn't work well you took the gamble and it didn't pay out but uh i don't know seeing the as is mentioned in there just yeah it has me a bit weary the main hardware is as follows AMD FX 8350 so quite an old cpu GTX 1050 16 gigs DDR3 one terabyte hard drive and a two terabyte hard drive so we're just rocking hard drives in this bill which means boot times are going to be pretty slow and um yeah game loading times all that are going to be fairly delayed if you're used to an ssd whether it be a SATA or an NVME drive these are going to be much slower than those this does not come with any monitors keyboard mice or any other peripherals it is the tower only please send an email i am responsive must be picked up yeah i i really don't like this here i mean price aside i don't think it's like it's not insanely overpriced but i just don't like this because if you meet this guy in a parking lot you're not going to be able to test it right you're going to bring a generator and like a portable monitor and like plug this thing in and turn it on before you give them cash i mean i guess you could right just bring like a gas generator or something or like a really beefy battery and uh plug everything in and give it a whirl but look if if you see an ad that says as is and it doesn't work by the time you pay the guy i guarantee you he's gonna say well i said it was as is so you just have to take it for what it is just you just don't want to deal with something like that and lastly here we've got a gaming pc it's a core i3 9100f rx 570 512 gig ssd how much you think it's selling for she actually ain't that bad 499 bucks okay i saw this and i thought wow that's you know decent uh the photos look okay you know we've got uh this uh cooler master this is like the q300l or whatever they call it we built it a few times it's a decent uh budget case and you know he's got the stock cooler but it's a core i3 so i'm not i'm not really sweating that cable management looks good uh you can tell that he's you know he or she's experienced and uh yeah i have no reason to to doubt the build quality here it looks like that uh looks like that antenna might be a little crushed but apart from that everything else looks good looks clean so the pictures check out and then down here specifications we've got core i39100f rx 570 16 gigs of DDR4 this is a good frequency here too nothing that matters as much for the core i3 but still a 512 gig NVME wow so a faster drive than i expected and then a corsair cx450m bronze rated power supply so a really healthy combination of parts in this build and you're only going to pay 4.99 for it i mean that's it's not like a killer deal but it's not bad it's not what we're used to seeing on this channel am i right i mean say 80 to 100 bucks for a core i3 and then maybe another 250 for that rx 570 i'm not sure if it's a 4 gig or an 8 gig but i'm just going to assume that it's a 4 gig because it's not specified uh and then we're at 350 there this is going to be another 60 to 80 bucks so make that 420 another half a terabyte in NVME storage i mean we're already pretty much at 500 bucks then you're gonna get a case and this power supply included as well so actually probably a tad cheaper maybe to buy this than to build outright which is a breath of fresh air because again a lot of the ads on here are just um i think they're just trying to extort people who have no idea what they're shopping for so yeah craigslist i mean it leaves kind of sort of a sour taste in the mouth i don't know it's not bad but you can definitely tell that it's aging and to some folks this is what they prefer because of how it's set up it looks like html5 coding it's a very bare bones ui uh the messaging platform baked into craigslist is extremely primitive as well i wouldn't even call it a messaging platform it's just a craigslist will disguise your email to kind of keep that private between parties and that's fine and that's worked for for a number of years i used to buy and sell phones all the time on craigslist when i was in high school and i just i got very familiar and comfortable with it but now that you have much more modern platforms competing with it it's difficult to to recommend it i mean i could send a dm an offer up keep my phone number and my email completely out of it and get a response fairly quick depending on the person whereas with email for whatever reason it just takes a bit longer that said you never know when you'll come across an ad like this and it'll only be of course on craigslist right it won't be on offer up and it won't be on facebook marketplace it'll just be here and uh you might miss out on it if you don't check craigslist there are a few sites that attempt to kind of merge all of them i'm not very familiar with those so maybe those are worth considering but um yeah i don't know i think at this point craigslist is more of a last resort option if i don't find anything immediately on offer up or facebook marketplace i come here and uh that's just me personally but yeah i mean it's not devoid of decent deals this one is definitely one to consider if you live in the Orlando Florida area this one's not too bad i don't know who listed this but um yeah it's it's not a rip-off and that's again a breath of fresh air in 2021 so with that if you guys like this video be sure to let me know by giving this one a thumbs up i would appreciate that if you're not subscribed again subscribe we do a bunch of cool stuff here we offer free pc cleanings and computer diagnosis troubleshooting and things like that uh on the channel here in the Orlando Florida area and uh you guys tend to get a kick out of those kinds of videos we do this all the time we publish those all the time i appreciate that support thanks for watching this far into this one leave a comment down below and i'll catch you in the next one my name is greg thanks for checking out craigslist with me!",

    "transcript": "hello good people I'm tweeting from Harware Canucks and I've been using the zenfone 6 for the last ten weeks and man who knew that Asus would come out with such a killer smartphone beautiful design excellent camera this thing is a battery champ but good people there are a few things we have to talk about that make this not such a perfect smartphone I cannot believe this thing has gone under the radar for so long and the space where features are removed from pixel for devices from oneplus devices I have not personally used such a complete Android package until the zenfone 6 I think you guys going to enjoy this one just like you might enjoy privacy calm that lets you use virtual credit cards for online merchants so your real bank information stay secured with real-time transaction monitoring more on that later so let's get the basics out of the way for the zenfone 6 there is a headphone jack with good quality output type C port for charging with an 18 watt power adapter included the fingerprint sensor is fast and easy to find there's a notification LED in the top right fantastic clicky buttons on the right side and since I have the anniversary edition my power button is blue nice touch there's also a smart key that activates Google assistant or can be remapped to a few other functionalities my favorite include did not disturb with a single click double clicking for flashlight and long press to take a screenshot there wallpaper game puts even iPhones to shame fantastic options in there and I have never seen such a large SIM card trade for dual Sims and the microSD compartment this will satisfy many for sure and for the base price of $4.99 with these specifications the zenfone 6 feels like an almost good to be true product but is it so my three least favorite things about the zenfone 6 include the speaker the volume here is not loud enough I can never position the phone in the comfortable position beside my ear to hear what's coming through the vibration motor on here is pretty weak I can never feel it inside my pocket and also the back is so slippery it's beautiful but it's also slippery in your hands even if you have a little bit of sweat and also if you have if you make phone calls like me like this this is a dangerous game my friend this thing has dropped many times luckily on the carpet never on like concrete but making phone calls for the slippery phone like this not a good experience and next I want to find all my favorite features like this gorgeous notch let's display and the unique camera system that makes it all possible the forehead is almost non-existent yeah that still has a speaker tag that pixel for Excel that looks to be the same size as the sides of the phone there is no camera cut out no hole punch no knotch is just beautiful the chin however is slightly taller but at least the rounded corners are consistent from top to bottom it is a big phone at 6.4 inch with a full HD plus IPS screen with 600 minutes of brightness HDR 10 support for media consumption this thing is incredible gaming is also enjoyable and this massive screen to body ratio is possible because of the camera module that can flip the Steven you the same quality selfies when needed while staying out of sight when retracted the mechanism is part mechanical not really a pleasant sound and it's part magnetic when it goes back into the body right there so there's a chance for the camera to flip out if you flick the phone like that but it does retract back into position when the camera app is not open and so far it has not been in inconvenience the selfie flip is quick enough plus you get full minion control of that flip rotation I call this the creep mode and if you ever want to create an uncomfortably tall panorama that is also possible and so is the creation of a 48 megapixel selfie it is quite impressive but you probably don't need that much detail in your face the consistency of photos is unfortunately kind of poor for example 48 megapixel photos have higher saturation but lowering resolution to 12 megapixels usually gives me better dynamic range and more consistent exposure and the wide-angle lens delivers a very cool perspective but detail and color information is vastly different versus the main lens I feel like the new iPhone 11 ultra wide-angle has set a new standard of camera calibration so they match each other in terms of color and detail and only the field of view changes and that's not the case with zenfone 6 but regardless the quality for the price point is totally possible I'm fine with it and if there's one thing that I would categorize to be perfect on the zenfone 6 that would be battery life the five thousand milliamp hour cell in here has been insanely impressive with heavy usage such as gaming and watching videos at full brightness give me more than 6 hours of screen on time while with lighter usage I got to about 4 hours of screen time and dropped only to 53% this thing is for power users with 2 day battery guarantee with additional power savings and super saving battery modes available for crazy long standby times the software experience is also perfect that there's very much stock androids with the usual customization of the home screen layout your eye contacts you can even enable multi window mode so watching YouTube while scrolling through social media for example there's a grayscale mode that I like for reading and if you want there's also FM radio and since the beginning I've really enjoyed the zenfone 6 with this brilliant flip camera setup that complements this whole notch list and really nice display it's a two day battery phone for sure and performance wise it is one plus level smooth the main competitor right now at 5:30 9 the most expensive zenfone 6 would be the one plus 70 with a 90 Hertz display and that is totally worth it but there's a notch no headphone jack wars battery life and people don't seem to like the camera bump so that's kind of where the most expensive zenfone 6 really moves ahead however at the base price of $4.99 this thing is hard not to recommend you know what else might be a good recommendation privacy comm it's a free service that creates virtual credit cards for online merchants like Amazon Netflix iTunes and others so your real credit and debit cards stay protected in case of breaches from online merchants setting up cards is no hassle all with a handy spending the customization for each card so you don't worry about cancelling subscription or

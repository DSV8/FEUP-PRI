    "transcript": "Are you going to take the blue pill or the red pill? Are you going to set yourself free from the constant monitoring and surveillance of Android Operating Systems? I don't think any of us like to be monitored 24/7 and unfortunately phones today are doing exactly that. If you want privacy if you want a secure Operating System then you're going to want to look at GrapheneOS. This is a pixel 6A that's already running GrapheneOS, in this video I'm going to show you how to install Graphene on a Pixel 7 Pro same process on the 6A very simple process to get yourself free from the constant surveillance of Google and others. So let's get started and escape the matrix. This Pixel 7 Pro has been set to factory defaults doesn't have to be but I'll just show you the full process setting this up. So basically a new phone I'll quickly set this up using the standard Android Operating System and then I'll show you how to install GrapheneOS on the phone. Okay so I'll press get started I haven't got a SIM card installed on this phone I'm going to skip that I'm going to set up a Wi-Fi network later I don't need that so I'm going to set this up offline. You can enable these Services if you want I don't need them isn't required once again for the installation so I'll click accept. I need to specify my country which is the UK and I'll press close and next you could put a PIN number in if you wanted to, I'm going to skip that so I'm going to skip the pin, swipe to navigate your phone I'm going to skip that and swipe up there you go phone is ready to go now I can connect it to my computer and install GrapheneOS. Now in this example I'm using a Windows 11 computer you could use other Operating Systems if you want to the GrapheneOS website has an FAQs section which shows you for instance which devices are supported, so various pixel phones are supported you can get the various details from their website but basically on the front page I'm going to click on install GrapheneOS and we're going to use the web-based installer this makes it much much easier. So I'll scroll down and we're told which Operating Systems are supported in this example it's Windows 11 but you could use one of those other Operating Systems if you want to. Now before we unlock the bootloader we have to do some work on the Windows computer and on the phone. So my team and I have created a PDF which I've linked below which helps you set this up I'm going to obviously show you the steps here but you could use the document if you prefer so the first thing we need to do is swipe up go to settings, scroll down, go to about phone swipe up, go right down to the bottom and press build number seven times. So one two three four five six seven and notice we're told that we are now a developer I'll press back on about phone go to system selected developer options I'm going to scroll down and select OEM unlocking and I'm going to enable that scroll down and select USB debugging and press ok. That little ping that you heard was my computer I've got this plugged into the computer already you don't have to plug it in before you make these changes but I've done that so in the document we're told to unlock the phone do those settings and then connect it to the computer . Okay so what I'm going to do is search for Windows updates check for updates, okay so we up to date I'm going to go to Advanced options, optional updates, driver updates I'm going to select LeMobile if I'm pronouncing that correctly other Hardware Android composite ADB interface and then I'm going to click on download and install. Okay so once that's installed I'll go back and now I can go to the GrapheneOS website and now I can unlock the bootloader but before I do that I have to do something on the phone. Okay so what I need to do now is boot the phone into fastboot mode so the way I'm going to do that is press the volume up button and the power button at the same time, we're told to reset to the phone now when you do that you need to hold the power down button so press and hold the power down button at the same time while the phone is restarting and there you go you can see it started in fastboot mode. So now in Windows I can click unlock Bootloader it's picked up the phone so Pixel 7 Pro if you don't see that you may have made some of the mistakes that I made, firstly you need to open a GrapheneOS on your computer while connected to the phone so you're opening up the web page on your computer using a browser that's supported like Chrome while you connected to the phone the phone needs to be in fastboot mode so I'm going to click connect so you need to press the volume down button now to select unlock the bootloader and then you need to press the power button. You need to now run through the basic phone setup once again so I'm going to say get started skip SIM card skip Wi-Fi click next on, uncheck the services click accept, choose my country UK, click close, click next, I'm not going to set up a pin so I'm going to skip that, select Skip and there you go phone has been set up. We now need to do something similar again so swipe up select settings go to about phone go to bold number and select it seven times so that we become a developer press back go to system, press on developer options toggle USB debugging and press ok we're going to do something similar again. So power and volume up restart the phone and then hold the volume down button while the phone restarts that takes us once again into fasterboot mode, so back on the computer we're going to download the Graphene Operating System, so you can see at the time of this recording it says cheetah factory 20230711. You'll obviously just get the latest release when you do this yourself okay so that's been downloaded so what I can do is click Flash Release, this please note; will replace the existing Operating System and wipe all the existing data so just be aware of that you're going to lose all your data on your phone. Okay so the phone has been flashed and it's now been restarted so various software has been written now to the phone, device goes through various restarts, at this point you just need to wait for the process to complete phone is going to be rebooted multiple times, software is going to be written to the phone, you're going to see stuff like this on the phone like Fastboot d, you'll see the phone reboot once again multiple times just wait for the process to complete. Okay the next step is to lock the bootloader, so bootloader is now locked on the phone now I need to press the volume down button to lock the bootloader, press the power button to select that option, the phone will now reboot with GrapheneOS. Okay last step is to press the start button to boot GrapheneOS it says Google here but it's actually going to boot into GrapheneOS and there you go just change to GrapheneOS. Okay so there you go we need to do the basic setup so specify your country UK or United States all specify UK. Now you can specify your Wi-Fi I'll skip that for the moment, I haven't got a SIM card in this phone so I'll skip that, you can decide whether you want apps to use location information I'll say next, I'm not going to set up the fingerprint for the phone you could put a PIN number in or skip that, so I'll just put a basic pin number in hopefully you'll use something better than that, I'll press next because I'm not going to restore any apps I'll press Skip and now I can press start. Okay so there you go I've got GrapheneOS running but what we want to do is disable OEM unlocking so I'm going to go to settings, scroll down, go to about phone, scroll down press bold number seven times once again put in my PIN I'm now a developer, I'm going to press back, go to system developer options I'm going to uncheck OEM unlocking, we're told that we need to reset the phone, so last thing I'll do is press the power button and restart the phone. Okay so there you go I've got GrapheneOS installed on this phone and I've locked it down. This is the first in multiple videos where I'm covering GrapheneOS, I just wanted to show you how to get it installed, probably the next question a lot of people will be asking is how do I get apps to work on the phone? So I'll cover that in a separate video.How to get notifications? How to set up the phone, so that it works in the way that you would expect. Hopefully you enjoyed this video. If you did, please like it and subscribe to my YouTube channel I'm David Bombal and I want to wish you all the very best. When you go out there make sure that you've escaped to the matrix. [Music]",

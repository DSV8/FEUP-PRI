    "transcript": "- PlayStation, Xbox Switch, WiiU, PC, VR headset. I'm all set, except this kind of sucks. The layout is far from ideal and if I want any airflow at all, I have to leave the cabinet doors open while I play, which can be a bit of a hazard. Now, my wife and I like the way this thing looks, but nothing about it seems to have been designed to be functional. And looking at some of the newer options online, I can't help but wonder what the heck people are supposed to be putting in these. Look at the dimensions of these cutouts. Does no one in the furniture industry play video games? And what, I'm supposed to put books in my Blu-ray player? So with that in mind, our only course of action was to break out the tools (drill whirring) and with the help of our sponsor, SolidWorks, take a nice looking cabinet to the next level to satisfy our tech needs. We've got cooling, dust filtration, RGB, and a few extra special touches to inspire your ultimate media console. Or maybe inspire the furniture industry to get its act together so we don't have to do this stuff ourselves. (drill clicking) Thank you SolidWorks, for sponsoring this project. They were a huge help in making this build. Check out their 3D experience, SolidWorks for Maker's offer in the video description and stick around to learn more. (upbeat electric music) Right out the gate, while it would've been fun to go the full custom route thanks to. Yeah, let's. (sighing) Oh, this is the back. (sanity meter beeping) Thanks to designer Charlie Zagaroli. Really? Okay. That sounds like a fake name. We didn't have to go from scratch. His Enzo Media console actually has a ton of the elements that we would include in a from scratch design, including a durable marble top, classic color scheme, and, perhaps most importantly, a killer sale price on Black Friday when I bought it. The first thing we did after taking delivery of the Enzo was to have Tim from the lab recreate it in CAD using SolidWorks. Features like externally controlled parametric equation files are a lifesaver for projects like this, where are adding all of the little funky details and dimensions can end up taking a staggering amount of time. With the model finalized, we were able to start planning the perfect gaming cabinet, starting with cable management. Bar for improvement, though, is very low here. I mean, many cabinets, actually including my own, have the cable management holes up high on the shelves for some reason. Why would you want to consolidate your cables up high where you can see them even better before you run them around to the back where they're no longer visible? It makes no sense. Unfortunately, Charlie, in his infinite wisdom, didn't actually do much better. The holes, A, don't match the picture. B, are kind of centered in terms of height and C aren't even symmetrical between the two sides. The solution though, a replacement full metal back that will allow us to drill any additional holes that we need and then pin everything down using the the upcoming magnetic LTT store cable management arches. As I mentioned before though, modern cabinets need more than just good looks. They need to be functional. And the biggest thing I've struggled with is cooling. I mean, it blows my mind, pun intended, that more cabinets don't include mounting points for ventilation fans. I mean, a mid-range gaming PC or current gen console will easily kick off 150 to 200 watts while it's running. So I've always had to add fan holes myself, and even my efforts haven't always been enough, which has resulted in these needing to stay open and actually being accidentally knocked off on more than one occasion. Let me show you what I mean. I'm gonna go ahead and fire up a GPU stress test. And while this is heating up, let's take a closer look at the upgraded cooling solution in Cabinet V3 over there. Check this out, we found another excuse to use one of these massive 200 mill by 30 millimeter Noctua fans. These things are all about moving the most air with the lowest noise possible. And at 86 CFM, we're gonna be replacing the entire volume of the interior of this cabinet about every four seconds at just 18 decibels. We're gonna lose some performance to the dust filter though, so we might actually have to add a second one for good measure, but this is a pretty good starting point. You can see I actually had things not bad. We're getting just about maximum turbo under this founder's edition RTX 30 80, but it gets pretty loud and you can actually (sniffing) smell hot electronics when you open the door. It's not a very good time in here. Let's see, do we actually get a little bit more frequency when we open up the door too? Eh, no, not really, but temps are dropping and it's getting quieter. Fan speed, 69%. Nice, nice. Next order of business, this all has to come out. This thing's really cool. I have a little HTMI 2.1 switch up here that's meant to be an extension for Marantz brand receivers, but you can just use it completely standalone and get three inputs to one input on your TV or your receiver or whatever the case may be. My Universal Remote didn't have support for this model because Logitech no longer supports their Harmony remotes, but I was able to just pick the last gen one and all the signals worked exactly the same. Ah, ah. One of the other challenges I really didn't think about is these. These IR blasters have to be within cable reach of the main universal remote hub and within signal reach of every device inside or on top of the media console and positioning them so that they actually hit everything every time can be such a pain in the butt. Why did I even decide (sanity meter beeping) to switch this thing out? Do we have drawers? - [Harrison] Wait, you said drawers, but you pointed the shelves. - Shelves. - [Harrison] Okay, thank you. - Do I seem smart to you? - [Harrison] Most of the time. - That's about as constructive of an answer as I could have asked for with a question like that. Ah, yes. If I was wondering what it contained, now I know. (wood thudding) Feels like it's made of paper. Charles, (wood thudding) paper really? Great, cable management handhold thing at the back. Got a little lip on here so your stuff doesn't come flying out the front in case gravity changes orientation. They're saying the Earth's core flows changing direction. Oh, these are actually, these are pretty good shelf hangers though. - [Harrison] I know. - I approve of these. - [Harrison] Right? Especially after the trouble we had with the MSI. - Yeah, not bad. I don't believe that Charlie would've signed off on this. I think they're going behind his back. Charlie would've put the cable management hole in a slightly less stupid place. Slightly. - Hey, Linus. - Oh, well that explains why there's serial numbers or something printed into the top of these shelves. You're probably not supposed to see those. You know what, I like my theory that they're supposed to go up to prevent things from falling out. Oh, it doesn't really prevent anything. 10 gig link back to the server room and then gigabit for everything here except the gaming PC, which can actually get 10 gig. Unfortunately this is an older 10 gig switch, so it won't do multi gig. It won't do two and a half or five, which honestly is like more than enough. Okay. Ah. What? You don't like my cable management hole? What's your problem? - That's a glory hole. - This thing is enormous. It absolutely dwarfs the other one. Dammit, Harrison, (sanity meter beeping) did you check the dimensions? - [Harrison] Yeah. - Did you check them with me? - You had this sideways. - Uh-huh. - It worked. - Yeah, it worked. - Wouldn't you rather have it a more accessible? - Well, (sighing) I don't know. - And the point is, every console. - Right. You have to get an Xbox and a PlayStation and all that in there. How else will I play PS VR? I'm not playing PS VR. Okay, fine. We might as well just load things in it now. - [Harrison] Yeah. Let's get this out of here. - There's a hole here. - [Harrison] VR. - That's VR. How, you know this is a drawer though? Is there a slit in the side of the drawer? I had some input on this, but I wasn't familiar with all the details going into things today. - [Harrison] We had this argument once before, let's do it again. 180 degrees, cables towards the back. - Seriously? I think you're high. - [Harrison] No, I think it's the absolute best decision. - What? The absolute best decision is an extremely strong choice of words. - There are three choices, there are three orientations that we can put this in. Cables towards the back is by far the most functional. What do you lose out on by having the power button at the front? - You're not wrong. I mean, it's awful, but it might be right. - It's not awful. (laughing) - Look at it! - I can't. You can't. - Now I see it. - Okay, that's convenient. - Now I don't. (door thudding) But now I see it. Fine. - It's the better (mumbling), it wins. - So VR goes in here. - [Harrison] VR goes in there. - And then the idea is that it just hangs out the front. - [Harrison] Yeah. - Like this. - [Harrison] Yeah. Whenever you want a VR, you don't have a door open to get knocked off. - Okay. I think that this is less stupid actually. Not bad. Not bad. Less stupid. That's good. I mean that's the bar. (door slamming repeatedly) (sanity meter beeping) Just treated myself to some adequate craftsman clippers. - This side is sticking up about a millimeter more than this side. (Linus hitting shelf) I don't know that that will... - I wouldn't describe it as (drawer sliding) smooth, but. (drawer thudding) - [Harrison] That's more what we're looking for. - Functional. We went from straight (beep) to straight functional. Cool. VR headset installed. Ah, so I'm kind of thinking switch this side or I don't know. I guess it doesn't really matter. The WiiU matters more than you think, okay? This WiiU is central to the experience. How else will we play motion control games? Shut up VR. Motion control. No, no, no. Not VR motion control. I'm talking classic motion control. Duck hunt. (guns popping) Okay not duck hunt. You get the point. No, no, the shield. Ah, boom. The shield. I do have to say, I'm having some second thoughts about the multiple shelves in here. Way to go, Harrison. You know what we could do is we could go shield on top of WiiU and then switch like this, and then it's a little bit easier to get at. (shelf thudding) Hmm. - [Harrison] It's almost like I had a CAD model to work off of. - You know, you went from, \"I wouldn't call anything that you did stupid,\" to \"Wow, you're an idiot,\" really fast. That's I think a record time. - [Harrison] Would you like the left hand shelves now that we're taking them out? - Well, do you like your left? Your face? Got 'em. Okay, I'm up. Oh wait, where do all the consoles go? - [Harrison] Right hand side. - [Linus] Oh, okay. - [Harrison] With the PC. - And these, I can probably all, hit all of with one IR blaster that I'll just put up here in the top. That means the Morantz thing is gonna have to go over here as well. IR blasters cannot hit Nintendo devices. So the only thing on this shelf that this needs to actually hit is this Nvidia shield. The only other things that need IR are the TV, which will get hit by the bubble that sits on the top, and the computer, which is, using this bad boy. So we may only actually need one IR blaster, but I feel like I should put one in up here for future proof-ness or something. Oh no, this Marantz HDMI switch also needs to be hit by the IR blaster. Oh God, where's the hub? The hub which is here. Oh my God, this pile of wires is a problem. That's it? - [Harrison] That's it? - [Linus] For cable management stuff? - [Harrison] You don't think that's enough? (sanity meter beeping) - Good savory dressing. Okay, I need a glue gun. Who needs to screw things in when you can simply. (console thudding) (sanity meter beeping) Wait, we left the wood backing in? - [Harrison] Oh, it's on the back. (sad music) - We didn't replace it though? - No, I thought it would look better if you only had wood inside. - I wanted magnetic mounting everywhere. This is what happens when I roughly lay out the scope for a project then am busy slash go on vacation and then come back and we shoot. (laughing) We just need stronger magnets. Watch this. I can't even put this one down because the one in my hand is so strong that it's grabbing onto it. Stop it. These are thick boys. (grunting) (chuckling) Geez. Oh yeah. Just wait. Just wait. It'll stick. Ah. (magnet thudding) (laughing) (Harrison gasping) When life hands you wood get a bigger magnet. Watch this to give you some idea how strong the ones I'm holding are. - [Harrison] To actually see the field. - Yeah, from this far away. - [Harrison] Yeah. - That's with a few of them stacked mind you. But they're, they're still, they're still quite OP. - [Harrison] But how do they work? - Here's the plan. I'm going to take this magnet and I'm going to glue it to the bottom of the shelf. Then I'm going to take this magnet and I'm going to glue it to the bottom of this thing. Then they're gonna go smashy smashy stick. Okay, no problem. No problem! (sanity meter beeping) Right, right. Okay. And at least we have metal on the back. So when we go to mount a power bar now, we can basically just go (power strip thudding) ka-chonk. These magnetic power strip holders are gonna be an absolute game changer once they hit the store. I know I've been teasing them for literally months at this point. I assure you we are working on them. They are coming. - Diametrically opposed wiring detangling strategies here. - [Linus] See you later. - Man untangles wires for multiple hours. All of world stunned. - Are you writing haiku's? Man, it really would be better to have the right shelves because then it would have the little Heidi thing on the, you know. - [Harrison] I'm gonna go get 'em. - Nope. No, I'm over it. I'm already gluing things to what is the top of these shelves, so forget it. Ow. That's very hot. It's a magnet. It has a hole in the middle. I just put my finger in hot glue. That's really smart. Having a kinda day. Go away! First day back from vacation. Easy day. Ooh. Tidy, right? Tell me it's tidy. - Looks great. - No, don't look that close. Don't look that close. Ow. (sanity meter beeping) Darn it, I stuck my finger in it again. Go away. All right, no problem. - [Andrew] You got glue in your beard. - You got glue in your beard. Boom. Got 'em. Wait, do we even have enough HTMI for all those consoles and stuff? The truth is I'm gonna unplug them all after anyway, so. I mean, longtime viewers are gonna know that anyway, we're just showing that you could. Oh no. I want this IR receiver for the computer. Ah. Ouch, ouch, ouch. Darn it. Ow. Both too hot for my hands and too cold to actually stick. Nailed it. - [Andrew] That's the balance you want? - Yeah. (sanity meter beeping) Really got things under control here right now. (spitting) Hot glue in my mouth. Oh, hot glue in the eye. (sanity meter beeping) Okay. Does that look okay? Can you even see that? - [Harrison] Before we go too far, should we check the height with the soundbar? - Okay. (laughing) It's really big. (laughing) You have a seat. - Okay. (Linus laughing) - It's so big. - It's all right. - It comes out like... - [Harrison] This is fine. - eight feet off the wall. - [Harrison] Don't look at the cabinet. Look at the TV. (Linus gasping) (sanity meter beeping) - It's so huge. Okay. (heavy breathing) Everything's fine. So this, Yvonne hasn't seen it yet. Maybe we could put a plant or something like a space filler so you don't feel like you're coming around this corner and gonna like, (grunting) take yourself out. (grunting) (chuckling) It's so big. Oh no. Okay. But hey, it'll hold a lot of stuff, right? - [Harrison] Which is good. - Damn boy! - [Jake] Damn boy he thick! - I am loving this all magnetic back though. Look at that. Just boom. Power bricks just stuck on there. Easy. - [Harrison] That makes me feel very good. - That's good. (chuckling) I was bound to say something encouraging eventually. Are we gonna get all this in here? - [Harrison] Heck yeah. - I mean today. - [Harrison] Slightly less heck yeah. - Yeah, slightly. Well, we've solved a few problems. (sanity meter beeping) For example, we have these dots to hopefully deal with this. (shelf thudding) - Your call remove bottom thing. - Nope, nope, nope. You know what? Let's try. - [Harrison] Double stack. - Two dots. And then we'll put a white one in the middle and we'll have an Oreo. (Harrison laughing) (door thudding) Hmm. Nope. Okay. (Harrison laughing) (sanity meter beeping) This is not going well. Quadruple stack? Quadruple stack. (door thudding) What? (door thudding) I mean, I guess it's better than that. The good news is that some other things went really well. So we got the hole for the second 200 millimeter fan in here. Looks absolutely awesome and things get even better. You're probably wondering about those metal frames that we put on the fans earlier. That's for these. That's right. Magnetic fan filters. Boom. Boom again. Okay, they don't stick amazingly. (sanity meter beeping) They're not like the super strong kind of magnet, but hey, once the fan is spinning, it's gonna stay on there no problem. It'll just suck it on there. And they are temperature controlled. Okay, not with the most sophisticated mechanism, but these little control boards are actually pretty cool. You set your target temperature with DIP switches and then you use a potentiometer to control the speed of the fan. It's sure as heck not from Corsair, I'll tell you that much. Which is good though because it means we don't have to have software running for it to work. And it also means that it can cool the cabinet when we're running a game console rather than a PC. That's what this space over here is for. What controls the RGB lighting? I just noticed there's RGB strips in here now. - [Harrison] Whatever button you press. - Oh, it's just a button. - [Harrison] It's Govee. Govee? Govee? - Oh, okay. So you could just put like effects and stuff in there if you really wanted to. Hello? Boop, boop, boop, badoop, boop, boop. Ooh, cool. We've made some big improvements to the charging situation. This is not that different from before, fundamentally, in that there's one of these brand who must not be named USB charging hubs and then a whole bunch of USB cables in a pile. But now (drawer sliding) the pile moves using the magic of, where's that stapler? Using the magic of a handheld stapler, we were able to just take this power cord and carefully not puncture it. Being sure to only work on it while it was not plugged into the wall. Staple it to the cabinet, staple it here. So it just kind of sits here with just the right amount of slack. And then when we need our stuff, boom, easy access. These are called watchmen. They're the receivers for the trackers that I wear for VR streaming. And the problem with these is that the reception sucks. So it's possible that we could go with shorter USB-C cables and just run them off the back here and just, kind of, sit them on the back of the computer. It's also entirely possible that with this metal grill in front of them, they won't work inside here at all. - [Harrison] Got it. - So we might end up getting a little bit creative and I was kind of thinking maybe we run them out the back and actually gonna put them here. - Yeah. - So that there's wood in between us and them. Yeah, these are not amazing. Ah. (controller clattering) (sanity meter beeping) (piece clattering) Yeah, these don't really stay in here, hey. We're gonna have this linked in the video description, but that's not gonna be a recommendation to buy it. I mean, realistically, I'm not charging any of these on here anyway. So these cables can just go. Ew, Micro B. How old are these? Bleh! I'm sure we could 3D print something better than these. Good enough for the video and then he never updated it. Yeah. (chuckling) - These have to be C to C, right? Because you need separate controllers for them. - Okay, that was a troubleshooting step. I thought I needed separate controllers for these, but it turns out it was actually just wireless interference. So maybe I do, maybe I don't. But what I know for sure is that most of my USB ports on this thing are C now because of that card. So yes. - Okay. - Long story short. If you're wondering what we're talking about, this is a super cool USB card right here. It's got eight USB-C 10 gigabit per second ports, but that's not what's neat about it. And what's neat is that it has four separate controllers for them. So it actually gets the full bandwidth to each pair of them. That means full bandwidth for devices like cameras or high speed external storage. And it also means that if there's any interference between different devices, say audio devices can be pretty picky about what else is plugged into the same port, that all goes away by just plugging into a dedicated controller. I love how we started with magnetic everything and then it took us how long to break out the hot glue? - You broke out the hot glue on day one. I undid your hot glue and replaced it with magnets. Are you happy with all the cross hairs now? There's nothing else to go from this shelf to that one? - Yeah. - Okay. - Yeah, I think, I think we're good. I mean, I'll probably find stuff, but it's simple enough to just pull this drawer out and then run a thing. - Yes. - And this is cool. The hole here is not quite big enough for this to (wire thudding) Seriously? (sanity meter beeping) Why is this thing such a piece of crap? Look at this Harrison. $3,000. Look at how much play there is. Why am I the only one outraged about the quality of fri- We're gonna have to do an LTT store media cabinet at this point. - [Harrison] Yes. - No, honestly though, like apparently there, there, this is acceptable. Look at that. I'm gonna have to break out the same long, stupid drill bit and the same counter sink thing to do the same after the fact repairs on this thing that I had to do in my old one. And that one was like 600 bucks, and not too big and didn't have drawers that don't work. (groaning) Look, I'm not blaming you. I'm just saying that you're the one who spent my money on this. - Yvonne chose it. I didn't wanna. - Yvonne's notorious for not checking the dimensions of things before she orders them. She ordered this doll house for the girls and she was like, \"Oh yeah, this will fit in our house.\" This thing was like five feet tall. I'm like, you know it has dimensions right on the site. She's like, \"I didn't expect it to be that big.\" Right, but the dimensions are right on the site. You know, I'm kind of feeling games on display on the shelf and maybe this is just random accessories. - Every family has a junk drawer. - Yeah. Yeah, junk drawer. Trunk drawer. Okay. Yeah. Theoretically this is just gonna work. You ready? What are the, unable to reach hub? Okay. - [Harrison] Good start. - Yeah. We changed the access points and this thing is one of those stupid things that won't just be like, \"Oh, the SSID is the same and the password's the same? No problem.\" - [Harrison] The red light went off? - Yeah, the red light went off indeed. I don't think this is going to work. Okay, I have no idea what's happening right now. Okay, let's try LGTV power toggle. Okay, well that worked. Hey. Sick. (horn tooting) Fans even spinning? Man, Noctua makes good stuff, hey? - [Harrison] Mm-hm! - Yeah, they're spinning. I wonder if the IR thing just is confused 'cause it's plugged into a different port than usual or something like that. I'm willing to bet that's the one. (TV beeping) Well, let's just start ripping stuff out. Is the unknown USB device out yet? - Oh. Oh. - Oh. Come on. Why would you do that? Oh, right. This, that was the dongle for my keyboard. Geez. Way to go, Harrison. I think it has to plug into USB two. GPU stress test. Now what I wanna see, oh my goodness. These fans are on already? You've got it real sensitive over here, hey? - [Harrison] I left them at the default settings. - Really? This is just default? Mm, yeah, but how's our frequency? Yeah. Yeah, it's a little bit better.

Substantially louder actually having this open in the front. Hmm. Did not anticipate that. Okay. LTT Store media cabinet.

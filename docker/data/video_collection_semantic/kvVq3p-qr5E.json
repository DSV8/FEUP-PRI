    "transcript": "- Hey guys, and welcome to This Is. Today we have a very special guest, Kevin Kenson, the world renowned video game expert who will regale us with the original console war between the Nintendo NES and the Sega Genesis. Nice word, regale, that's a nice little touch. Hello Kevin. - We're on now? - How many videos have you done on consoles? - A lot, but... Enthusiasts. - Have people from North Korea watched your videos? Yes. I bet you could. I bet you have, like, four views from North Korea. We're just gonna move on from that. - What are we gonna talk about today? - Yeah, wow, that was a weird topic. So we are talking about, I don't know how secret it is but the first big original console war of the Super Nintendo versus the Sega Genesis. We're gonna focus a little more on what kind of, how should I put this, like the boiling pot. Like everything that leads to the moment of when it all goes crazy. - Because we all know the story of, oh, you know, Nintendon't and blast processing and all the nerdy fighting and the Super Nintendo games without blood and it was a weird, strange time. - No, there's a lot that goes on. But what's really interesting is the story that precedes all that and how we kinda entered that situation. So, the main thing really to talk about is what it's like for Sega going up against Nintendo and how they can make the decisions they did. And before that, we gotta talk a little bit about, you know, how Nintendo got in power and before that, to kind of start it all off, we gotta talk about how Atari screwed everything up in the west for a little bit. - [Austin] Go for it. - Back in 1983, kind of a popular thing that people will reference is the city of the video games crash in the west. And basically what happened was video games were this big exploding thing. There was a bunch of different systems coming out, tons of competitors, and everyone's making video games. And it was really cool for a little while until 1983 when everything falls apart. - ET, It was all ET's fault. It was shovelware, though, I mean that was the main problem was just that everyone was trying to jump on the craze. So many games like, some dude, here, three months, make this game and we're gonna print 500 million copies or whatever the case was, it was just completely unsustainable. - Yeah and it was at a time that when, like, you know, we have shovelware today still but now in the shovelware, there's forums, there's videos, there's reviews, there's a lot of ways to know stuff. Back then, people would just buy whatever looked cool on the shelf and when you buy, like, six games in a row and they all are terrible, it kinda starts to make you think, I shouldn't be spending money on this. - Sorry, mom. - Which is exactly what happened. Fun fact about the landfill thing, everyone thought that was a myth for the longest time. There was always this kind of story of like, Oh yeah, you know things went so bad for Atari. They dug a giant hole out of the desert and filled it with stuff no one would buy. And if you told anyone about that like in the mid-2000s, they'd be like, no, that's stupid. That never would have happened, what are you talking about? And then I think it was 2009, 2008? They found it and dug it up. And it was a whole thing. - Didn't Microsoft pay for the doc or something? Like I know that I saw that they had recorded something about, like you know, doing a doc around that. - There is a whole doc. - And excavation and stuff. - [Kevin] Yeah, there is an entire documentary about that and in fact, even, a kind of thing that happened as a result of that excavation is people bought stuff that was taken out of the site. - [Austin] Yeah, I thought about it. - And there's, certificates of authenticity and everything of like, Hey, I have this game. In fact, actually, uh, I was talking to a collector recently and he had one in his collection. He's got all these nice things on display and there was one box that was just totally beat up and destroyed and he was like, Oh, yeah, that, that's from the landfill, that's why. - That's so cool, and it's a legitimate piece of gaming history. Because when you think about that time, right, there was obviously this huge bust, I know in Japan, things weren't quite so extreme but here in the west, I mean, there was, basically video games went from this huge industry to, home video games were just dead until the NES. - Yes, until Nintendo came to the west. And so the way Nintendo kinda ends up taking power over here is by doing very, very hard work to convince everyone that what they're bringing over is not a game system. 'Cause they think that the market's there, it's just everyone's too afraid right now to invest into it because all the major stores that would be selling it or carrying it are like, no, we tried selling these things and it tanked. Why would we do this now? So the way Nintendo does this is when they come over to the west with the NES, they don't market it as a video game console. They don't even start calling it that. Initially it's called the Nintendo Entertainment System Control Deck. See, the NES-- - Control Deck, yes! - Yes, the Control Deck is the original bundle. If you ever see the old boxes for the original NES, it's just called the Control Deck and the idea of the marketing is that, Oh, the NES, yeah, no, that's a cool part of this thing and yeah, you can buy other cartridges and stuff for that. But the real thing you're buying is Rob the Robot. And you can control Rob the Robot using the Nintendo NES Control Deck and it was this whole thing and it worked! You know, they were telling everyone-- - It sounds so ridiculous today. - Yeah, no, it was the silliest way of marketing something but they convinced everyone that hey, no, this is just a toy and then people started playing games on it and other titles started coming out and there was this level of quality that wasn't present on all those previous competitors, at least once the, kind of, shovelware era of Atari started happening that people are like, oh, Nintendo's awesome. And that's really one of the big things that Nintendo did to differentiate themselves from, you know, Atari, Coleco, all that other stuff that happened before is being very, very, very, very controlling over what makes it on their system which later on has some repercussions but initially, it is a very, very good strategy to take where instead of just letting anyone make anything for their console, they're like, Hey, if you wanna make stuff for us, you have to have an agreement with us, you have to buy cartridges from us... - You need the seal of approval. - You need our seal of approval, otherwise we're not gonna sell it at all which allows them to do a couple different things including not only making sure that everything making it to the system is actually good but also being able to control things like, Hey, company over here, you can only make, like, four or five games a year which is kinda questionably legal, especially in retrospect, but at the time, it was kinda necessary to repair all the damage that the crash of 83 caused. - It's hard to imagine today, but there was a very real moment in history where video games might not have survived. - No, not in the west, certainly. There wasn't as big of a fall-out in some other countries. Japan was actually doing pretty well when everything started to go to crap over here and there is some argument that maybe, like, computer games sort of survived and maybe we would just be a pure PC gaming thing right now. But Nintendo was really what saved the concept of buying a home entertainment system, a console. - So there's a lot of, like sort of, weirdness in those early days but other companies quickly realized, Hey, you know what, there's something really to this even though they had been scared off in a lot of cases by the boom and by the bust. - And what you would especially see early on is Japanese companies trying to replicate what Nintendo did and that's where Sega comes in, you know, they see Nintendo is taking over this western market very strong, Nintendo also has a very strong grip on the Japanese market but other companies want to start making their move. So western companies are still afraid for a little while, there are some game developers but no one's really working on hardware as much at the time. Sega makes their way over to the west and their first attempt is with their direct competitor to the NES, which is the SG 1000. Later on, it's upgraded to the Master System, which is technically the 1000 Mark III. Those don't do that great. Sure, they can play games, but none of them really hit the same level of popularity that Nintendo has. - Okay, so like, this is a legit question, what was the most popular game on the Master System? - That I don't know off the top of my head. - Right, that's a huge problem for them, right? They obviously had roots in the arcade space, right? But the SG 1000, as far as I was aware, was way too underpowered to really move a lot of those games over, right? Whereas you saw some crossover between some Nintendo cabinets as well as the NES. - Yes, exactly, yeah, so Nintendo's able to move a lot of their recognizable stuff from cabinets, like Donkey Kong, over to their system. Sega, on the other hand, they did have some amazing cabinets in arcades. I mean, there was a lot of classic games that did things that no one else was really seeing yet that were cool. I mean, a personal favorite of mine, Space Harrier which is this insane-looking game - The overhead, it was sort of like, a top-down style. - No, no, no, no, Space Harrier is the one where you're this dude floating around with a giant laser cannon. - [Austin] Oh. It was an analog stick where you moved it around and aimed. It was a very trippy experience but it was one of the first early examples of almost, like, pseudo 3D style graphics so that blew people's minds in arcades. The SG 1000 couldn't do that. Any kind of good will they built with people with their arcade cabinets wasn't translating over to console market. - At least at first. - At least at first, yeah, with those systems. So that's where we end up in the situation right now where Nintendo is the head honcho, the big guy that everybody wants to replicate, they want to work with them, or they want to try and compete against them and no one's succeeding at that yet. So, Sega's next attempt is to move things on to the next generation and the Sega Genesis actually comes out well ahead of when the Super Nintendo does so they actually have the most advanced system-- - This is before the time of like, Oh, obviously you make the NES, the Super NES, you have the follow-ups. I mean, there was, I think, a lot of, especially in the Nintendo camp, there was a lot of interest in, let's just make the NES forever. Or let's, like, upgrade in like 10 years or whatever the case is. It was kinda the Genesis slash Mega Drive that kinda forced the upgrade cycle to even happen. - Exactly, exactly. 'Cause at the time, Nintendo was the only game in town so you need someone to actually push tech to force them to need to upgrade as well. So the Sega Genesis comes out pretty in advance of the Super Nintendo, still doesn't really do great. Again, because the big issue is they don't have any strong titles to associate with the brand. And the large problem with that is because everyone was too afraid to not work with Nintendo. Again, Nintendo was very controlling over who can work with them and their situations were like, Oh, you wanna make stuff with Sega? Sure, you can do that. You can't make anything with us anymore. - There's no way that would be legal today. - Yeah, and then the other issue where that comes up too is also with retailers, where, you know, Nintendos were selling so well for a lot of major brands that if you approached them being like, Hey, do you wanna carry our thing as well? They'd be like, I don't know, Nintendo's kinda got a good thing going for us. I believe, I forget if this is during, we haven't talked about Kalinske yet but we're gonna get to that. I forget if it was Kalinske or his predecessor Katz, but they approached Walmart to be like, Hey, guys, we need to make like, can you please carry our stuff? And Walmart's like, Nintendo is 10% of our sales, flat out. Not like, oh, like games under, like just Nintendo specifically is 10% of all of our profits. We don't want to anger them. - What? - So why would we carry your stuff? - Wow. - Yeah. - That's crazy. - Yes. - So that really kinda sets the stage for what Sega was getting themselves into. - Yeah, so again, Sega's having a rough time trying to compete and this is before they even have the Super Nintendo which is the even footing, you know. They have the more powerful system and they're suffering and eventually the thing that really starts to turn the tide and cause what we recognize as, like, the console war of the '90s, there's two main things. The first thing is Kalinske. So Tom Kalinske takes over for Sega operations in America and a large part of his job is to basically just run things how he wants to make the Sega more appealing to western audiences. 'Cause so far at that time, both Nintendo and Sega are taking very Japanese approaches to how they approach the market. They're just making the products, getting it over there, and it speaks for itself. Sega realized that's not really working out for them so that's when Kalinkse gets in charge and starts changing things up. Before him, there was this other guy, Katz who actually was a friend of Kalinske's and there was kind of an awkward thing when they changed command. Katz's whole approach to making the Genesis a success that didn't work out and instead cost them a lot of money, there were two main approaches. One, branding. If they're not able to work with companies that Nintendo's already working with, well, let's try to get really big name stuff on the system relevant. So they try to do things like bring in big brands to compete with what Nintendo's doing. So for instance, you know, Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!, big success on Nintendo, so the Sega logic is, Well, we can't work with that brand so what if we worked with Buster Douglas, the guy who ended up beating Mike Tyson and we make a game off of that? And that kind of logic pervades a lot of what they do which didn't really work because while they might have names, there's not really any established history yet of those games being good and it's costing Sega a ton of money to try and actually, like, seal these deals. The other thing that Katz did for Sega though that I think a lot of, this is probably the thing that's lasted the most out of his legacy is introducing the phrase, It does what Nintendon't. And the entire idea behind that slogan was like, Hey, you know, we're gonna have these cool arcade game ports on the Genesis and it's gonna do stuff and it's just a catchy line. One of my favorite stories from, actually a lot of what we're talking about here comes from this book, Console Wars. So one of my favorite stories that actually comes out of this book is that when Kalinske is first kinda being courted by Nakayama to take over for CEO, they're talking about different ways that Katz is running it and one of the lines is like, Oh yeah, we have this catchphrase, you know, it's not working? And Nakayama's response was more or less like, No, it's not, what does that even mean, it's stupid. Oh, it does what Nintendon't. What, does it not sell? Is that the thing we do that Nintendo doesn't do? It was just a whole thing where it's like, it's this cool-sounding line but there was nothing backing it up yet and so I think people love that line in retrospect because eventually Sega does end up becoming a cool competitor but back when it was first being used, it was just kind of empty words. - Well, so like, the interesting thing to kinda put all this in context, is when you think about it, the Genesis, like you said, was out two, two and a half years before the SNES? - [Kevin] Mm-hmm. - [Austin] So the fact that there actually was a legitimate technical advantage. Games on the Genesis and Mega Drive looked better than what you'd get on the Nintendo side. - Yeah, but the only problem is they just didn't have - The games. - The games, yeah. - And there's also the other aspect of what comes with when Kalinske takes over. There's an imaging thing and there's a gaming thing. So on the gaming side of things, aside from Kalinske, the other thing that really turns the tide for them is they finally get their new mascot. So up until the blue hedgehog that we all know and love that I'll talk about in a second, before then, they had another mascot that was Alex Kidd which was basically their version of Mario. It wasn't the exact same, he's not a plumber, he's not an Italian with a mustache or whatever but the point is it's a human person that is like, This is our version! No one really cared. So after Kalinske takes over, one of the kind of, internal arguments that's going on over at Sega Japan is like, Hey, we gotta come up with some kind of new mascot, something new and there's a whole, it's like it actually, I believe it was an internal company contest. Like just everyone across the company was making designs and they tried figuring out who would take the lead. There was a lot of really weird ones, some of which ended up kinda being incorporated into the eventual Sonic design but the finalists, as I recall, are Sonic the Hedgehog who before then I think was just called the Needle Mouse or something like that. - The Needle Mouse? - [Matt] Mr. Needle Mouse. - Mr. Needle Mouse, yes. He was called the Mr. Needle Mouse and my personal favorite, this goes back to someone I mentioned earlier, Teddy Roosevelt in pajamas. I don't know what the logic was. I don't know why they thought it was a good idea but that was the chief competitor to Mr. Needle Mouse. He lost. - [Matt] There was also an egg. - There was an egg which might've influenced Eggman later. Again, a lot of these ideas ended up being incorporated into later stuff. Is Dr. Robotnik just a fusion of Teddy Roosevelt and an egg? - I mean-- - I'll let you guys decide. - [Matt] Based on the description, that's how it feels to me. - So the thing that really jumps out to me here is that Sega was obviously a very large company and they were making money in the arcade space, but they were essentially dumping so much cash into trying to make, first the Master System and later the Genesis actually successful but until they got really got that marketing and especially until they started getting the hip, cool, trendy sort of thing because before that, no one had really been able to challenge the NES. - Yeah, well, and so this is where Kalinske's really important. 'Cause Sonic is a big deal and it's kind of part of what Kalinske uses to re-brand Sega very heavily, because what Kalinske does, he is probably one of the most important people for video games history in the west because he was the first guy who actually started realizing how to market video games in the west. Again, before, everything was very Japanese thought process before, the product spoke for itself, they didn't really know how to market quite yet. And Kalinkse wasn't a video game guy. He had no history really playing video games. He was toys, he primarily worked with Mattel before and worked on a lot of their really popular lines so he wasn't a gamer but he was a salesman and he was a people person, he knew how to read people. In fact, another really cool story about how he joined Sega is, you know, Nakayama was like, Hey, yeah, you should really work with us. Like, we've got some cool stuff in works. And he brings him to, you know, their offices. I believe this is after the, yeah, this is after the Genesis was already out. But it's like, hey, look. This is our Genesis, this is our thing that isn't selling quite well yet but we want you to help change that and the thing that actually gets Kalinske interested and changes his mind is the Game Gear. The Game Gear - Ooh. - The Game Gear was not a known thing yet and they were like, Hey, look, there's this thing we're working on. It's a handheld gaming system and while historically, the Game Gear ended up not being the huge success we all thought it was-- - It was a big deal. - On paper, it's a huge deal. The kind of visual, the graphics it was giving... Sure, the battery life lasted only maybe five minutes but it looked great while it was on. - Well, that was the big difference, right? Because obviously on one hand, we've got the home consoles and obviously there's like arcades above that. But this is really the beginning of the portable consoles as well, right? Because Game Boy was '89, Game Gear was '90? - '90, '91. - '90, '91. So the idea was that the Game Boy was a very low-end, you know, it was one of the most basic, simple kind of handhelds you could imagine. - But it had Tetris. (laughs) - It had Tetris, it had Pokmon later, I mean there's a lot of huge games for it but then you're talking about a green display with like, four colors. - And it was enough. - Well, black, dark gray, light gray and green. - So, yeah, so again, Kalinske doesn't know a lot of games but he knows about marketing and so there's a couple different things he does to kind of begin the tide of turning against Nintendo. The first thing is making use of Sonic. At the time when the Genesis was out, they were bundling with Altered Beast which anyone who was like a hardcore Sega kid growing up, yes, there is very fond, nostalgic memories of it but at the end of the day, that thing was not exactly a console pusher. They needed their version of Mario to be like, Hey, this is why you need to buy this system. Sonic ends up being the bundled game and that is a huge game-changer right away because once people start actually buying Segas and there's all this word-of-mouth about this awesome, super-fast side-scrolling game that's, you know, unlike other things they've played, - [Austin] And not possible on the NES. - [Kevin] And not possible on the NES, yeah. So, they changed the game that's bundled with the Sega, they also price-cut on the Sega. They wanted to sell it for cheaper. - That was a big deal. - Yes, that was a huge deal. Well, and so, what's really interesting about the four-point plan that Kalinske had was that when he took it to Nakayama and the board of people that were running everything in Sega Japan, everyone hated it. Not Nakayama, he was just like, Hey, look, I hired you for a reason, I trust you to understand how the American audience works. Do what you want. You have the open, like, you have my confirmation for everything to just run things the way you want to. But everyone else who ran that company was like, This is, why are we selling it for less, this is insane. - Well, the idea there was that, and this is something which has definitely stood the test of time, is that instead of making your money on the console, you make your money on the games because obviously, you've got Sega who are selling their direct games but you've also got third parties who are paying licensing fees to make games for it. So I think Nintendo actually, if I recall right, Nintendo is actually the only company who still does this. They still actually make a profit on almost all of their hardware, right? - Yeah, uh... - I mean it's all unconfirmed and kinda hard to say - Yeah, it's all unconfirmed and it varies by system. I believe the Wii was at a loss but the Wii U was at a profit even though that all fell apart. - Well, profit. - I'm actually not sure what the official line is. Yeah, per individual unit, yeah. - But we know Microsoft definitely loses money on Xboxes, Sony likely loses money, like I mean, it's not really the consoles who are, you know, you have $400 or whatever but that really goes into R and D and the actual manufacturing and stuff and Sega was really kinda the first company to take that and move that forward as an actual strategy. - Not only that, but they also realized that if you need to compete against someone who's on top, you have to make yourself a very attractive offer by being a lot more affordable. - Yeah, better, cheaper, whatever the case is. - Exactly. Better, cheaper. So Sonic, changed the bundling, slashing the price, all this stuff goes into heavily making the Sega a more attractive option and then the big thing also, for appealing to the west is shaking up the dialogue of Sega versus Nintendo and this is, you know, after the Super NES is out and they do a re-launch of the Sega Genesis, this is where things really change 'cause that's where, when most people have memories from their childhood if they grew up during this time in the '90s, they always remember all the big heavy advertisements about Nintendo versus Sega and you know, Sega very much adopted this concept of being the cool system. Nintendo was the guy that had been around before, you know, your older brother or whatever had an NES - Your dad's console. - Yeah, exactly. But Sega's the cool new thing and part of that comes from them having new stuff, you know, Nintendo has this Italian plumber in overalls while Sega has this punk rock hedgehog that is extremely excited all the time and in cartoon form, likes chili dogs but I don't know, it's a whole thing. The point is that it shakes up the narrative a lot and a big part of that too is, again, this thing about Nintendo being very controlling about what makes it on their system. Sega did not care nearly as hard. There's still some degree of quality control but they are much more willing to let whatever people wanna make for the system on there. One of the most popular examples of this is Mortal Kombat. So Mortal Kombat was huge, huge success in arcades but obviously there's also this kind of narrative that's being shaken up of like, oh, this is really violent. Should we really let kids be playing this? So eventually when it makes its way to consoles, it came out on both the NES and the Sega at the same time which at that time, was also insane. You didn't get multi-platform releases like that very often. So this game makes its way to both systems and it ends up being this kind of cut down, safer version. - There was no blood on the Nintendo version. - Well, so initially for both versions, if you just play the games as they launch, yes, there is no fatalities, there is no blood, anything like that. However, the Sega version of the system, when you start it up, there'd be this kind of like opening screen that would, not clearly tell you how to do it, but it basically hinted at a code you could enter that would unlock the traditional version of the game where all the blood, all the fatalities, all that kind of stuff, is intact. And people learned that very quickly and the result is that Mortal Kombat sales on Sega absolutely crushed Nintendo sales. I actually talked to the author of this book, Console Wars, and one of the most surprising things that he told me about this entire situation is when you think back to like '90s and like satanic panic and all this kind of stuff about-- - The satanic panic. - Yeah, classic. That was a little more '80s but anyways, the point is like when people were freaking out about violence in this kind of content, you always hear stories of, like, you know, oh, parents calling and complaining about the violence and how could you let me buy this for my kids even though they bought it. But in the case of Mortal Kombat, there was actually a lot of situations that were the reverse where there are families that have been buying Nintendo consoles that are calling Nintendo to complain about the fact that, like, Hey, why does my kid have like the worse version of this game? Like, his buddies got the Sega and theirs is way cooler than his and he's complaining to me now because I bought him Nintendo and now apparently that wasn't the right call. So there's this whole uproar from the audience. - So, if this was today, the analogy would be if you're playing Fortnite on Nintendo, you're like, uh, there's an analogy here. (laughs) Help me, help me. There's like... - Let's say Fortnite came out on all three major systems and Nintendo is the only version that doesn't-- - Without guns! - No, no, no, no, I got a better one, I gotta better one. Doesn't feature dances. - That sounds like a pro. I would rather play that version. - [Kevin] To you, but to all the kids that are playing that's like-- - All right, all right. - Come on, Fortnite dances, are you kidding me? Yeah, Nintendo cut out, like, the thing that made it popular and that hurt. And so this is really important too because while, eventually, you know, whatever, at the end of the Console War with Nintendo versus Sega, Genesis didn't really end up winning out. It put up an amazing fight, way more than anyone expected but what's really important is how much it opened the door for what later on happened with stuff like PlayStation and Xbox. Kind of the sad version of the story for focusing on Kalinske being an important thing for Sega is the fact that, you know, he does all this great stuff for Genesis and then, when it comes around time for Saturn, they stop listening to him entirely. And like, to the point of he's like, Guys, why are you doing this, this is a dumb idea. And they're like, no, no, we know what we're doing now. And they didn't and then the Saturn didn't go great. - The Saturn was, well, that's a story for a whole other thing. - That's a whole other thing. - That was a ridiculous, ridiculous time. - But the important point I wanna make here though is that like, the stand that Sega made against Nintendo really influenced what we now have with PlayStation and Xbox because they opened that same door by being like, okay, we can make games that are aimed at adults. It doesn't always have to be kid-friendly stuff. We can make mature-rated stuff, we can market this idea that we're the new cool stuff. We don't necessarily have to be, you know, we don't have to be super traditionalist like Nintendo was maintaining and that's what eventually led to this point where we have a console war today and whenever you talk about console wars in the modern context, it's Xbox versus PlayStation. No one really talks about Nintendo in that same way. Sometimes they do but it's always looped in as this sort of like, that third guy over there doing his own thing. Which I'd argue also has also worked out for Nintendo in some ways, especially now with Switch but it changed the entire narrative of what games could be in the west, big time. - That, my friends, was a presentation by Kevin Kenson. - That was probably 80% correct. I'll leave it to you. - That's better than This Is usually is, Matt. - [Matt] Whoa! - Thank you so much for watching this episode, you should absolutely be sure to check out Kev's channel as well as your brand new slash several months old video about the original console wars. - Yeah, you know, we did cover a lot of stuff before actually in a video talking about when the Analog SG Mini came out, which is just a way to play Sega Genesis games on a TV, it's really cool, you should check it out, but as part of that video, I wanted to relive the console war by actually talking to the author of this book. He's an awesome dude, gave a lot of really interesting stuff that wasn't just in the book, but it's kind of more behind-the-scenes stuff, a little bit. Awesome interview, make sure you check it out. - Yeah, and anyway, if you enjoyed this video, make sure to let Ken know that Matt is a stand up guy, and he really would make a great step father. - Hey.",

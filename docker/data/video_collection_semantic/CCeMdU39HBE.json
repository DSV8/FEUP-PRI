    "transcript": "ah so what's up guys I don't think I'll get much argument from you to say that 2017 was an amazing year for AMD's processor division there's an architecture to to really pushed Ryzen and Threadripper forward as a really good alternative to Kaby Lake X and sky lake X processors and Verizon even proved to be a good alternative to coffee like but at CES 2018 AMD's taking the lid off the next generation of processors and their graphics chips that are coming much sooner than you might think and I'm super excited about them and you guys should be too by the way a huge thank you to our sponsors Phanteks Corsair and Cooler Master for making the show possible now before I get into it the actual products I think it's important to explain AMD's plan to either match or pull ahead of Intel in the short term to mid-term future and one of the primary challenges over the last decade or so was and still is aimed ease manufacturing process inferiority while Intel CPU was using the 22 nanometer to 14 nanometer lithography aimed II was stuck on the 28 nanometer since 2014 and this obviously placed him in disadvantage when it comes to power consumption heat and die size now Ryzen mark to move to a much more efficient 14 nanometer process but that was just the beginning and in 2018 we will see AMD's first move to a 12 millimeter node for both desktop and mobile processors whereas Intel will remain with their refreshed 14 nanometer technology until Canon Lake is launched on the 10 nanometer later this year amazingly AMD's actually thinking to move into the 7 nanometer process come 2019 but what does that actually mean for you if you're looking towards AMD in the future well there will be a rapid rollout of new Zen based processor architectures the first out of the gate will be the Zen Plus which uses the 12 nanometer manufacturing process to deliver up to 10 percent better performance by optimizing in some key areas CPU is based on Zen plus are actually sampling to partners right now in preparation for a launch in April now make sure you realize that there won't be any fundamental changes to the overalls and architecture until then two launches in 2019 with that 7 nanometer process and then plus will basically be refreshed design that also we'll be able to achieve higher sustained clock speeds but the cool thing about the Zen too is that its design is already complete and basically AMD has two CPU teams that are leapfrog in each other so once the Zen architecture was complete that team moved on to the Zen 2 architecture while the other team started working on the Zen + architecture and now they're moving into the design stages of the Zen 3 which will be sometime in 2020 so AMD is seriously moving fast and there's more to all this than just changing manufacturing processes - because AMD is also trying to move beyond the usual 7 to 8% year the performance increase but AMD thinks they can push things even further and offer their clients much more performance with each new cycle AMD will be launching a new series of desktop APU's that combined Ryzen processor course with Vega integrated graphics units these used to be codenamed the Raven Ridge and there's something odd about them - even though they will have the 2000 series name unlike other 2000 series CPUs they will use the originals and architecture rather than Zen plus and I'm not sure why AMD's doing this because it might cause confusion but probably most exciting additions to aim these lineup in 2018 comes the new next generation of Ryzen processors with the second generation of rising CPUs which are based on the twelve nanometer Zen plus core design there will be a full line of being launched with a new series of motherboards and brand new features but don't worry current boards will be compatible with rise in 2000 series processors not only that but in the second half years Zen+ will be used to refresh threadRipper into a newer and faster beast there'll be another super busy year here at Hardware Canucks and I'm super excited to check it out and you should too and in order to prepare their current lineup for the arrival of new processors there have been some price cuts which you'll see almost immediately for example the 1900X has received the big $100 price cut because I'm guessing the upcoming 2800X will have a very similar performance in some instances the rest of the rise in seven lineup has also received nice price drops ranging from $150 for the 1800X to $15 for the Ryzen 5 1500X and you also notice the addition of two new APU's with the standard Ryzen cores and Vega graphics the four core 8 thread Ryzen 5 2400G at the hundred seven dollars and the quad core Ryzen 3200G for just $99 and these will actually act as lineup replacements for AMD's Ryzen 5 1400 and Ryzen 3 1200 okay so that pretty much wraps up the lineup of aim these processors but what about the graphics well that is one area where they need help the most but unfortunately it looks like there's going to be a bit of a wait until Radeon series can pull free of Vegas failures there is hope on the horizon though so check this out sometime in 2018 will see Vega architecture transition to a seven nanometer manufacturing process but there is no word whether or not gaming cards will actually receive this refresh but I'm guessing not there won't be any significant core changes but supposedly AMD already has seven enemy intercourse in hand for use in their radio on instinct mi-25 cards that are used for deep learning algorithms the first significant change for the consumer cards would likely come with navi which is due in 2019 and then there'll be a brand new architecture coming in 2020 which should utilize and optimize the seven nanometer manufacturing process but here's the issue though we're still waiting for the lower-end vega cards outside the vega 56 and 64 variants and AMD has also announced dedicated notebook GPUs based on the Vega architecture and it could be these mobile course will eventually morph into lower and desktop variants and that we'll finally be able to go up against the gtx 1060 or the gtx 1050 unfortunately AMD wasn't really able to provide us with any more information about the specifications or any official launch dates for these mobile GPUs but it looks like there'll be some notebook designs with them before q2 of 2018 it does look like there's a single stack of HP m2 memory so that means memory would likely be between 4 gigabytes and gigabytes and there are also a few notebooks on display at CES and we'll have to make sure to check those out in okay so that wraps up this video there's a lot to be excited from AMD coming in 2018 make sure to check out our rise in to coverage and their whole APU direction I'm a Dmitry thanks much for watching stay tuned for more CES coverage",

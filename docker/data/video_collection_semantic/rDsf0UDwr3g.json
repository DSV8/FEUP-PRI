    "description": "Thanks to LastPass for sponsoring this video!  Click here to create a LastPass account for free!    HERE is the smart lock we reviewed today:  This new smart lock should be able to connect with your phone, your house, and hold all kinds of different codes inside so you can tell who comes and goes. Pretty awesome on paper. But does it work in real life? After tearing down the Schlange smartlock we find that the metal construction is solid, and there is no easy access point to physically hack the lock... BUT from a smartlock perspective its... pretty dumb. The app to my phone just wouldnt work, and judging by the reviews from the app store... its a pretty wide spread issue.   On Amazon the lock very highly rated. In the google play store, it is not. Interesting.  It is a WONDERFUL keypad.  But I was hoping for something a little more intelligent. Especially for that price.

    "transcript": "Today we're going to review this high-tech key-coded blue tooth smart lock. Hopefully it's a bit more secure than the last lock we tested. I'm going to show the installation on it too. Huge thanks to LastPass for sponsoring this video. Let's get started. [Intro] This residential door lock claims to be pretty intelligent, but today we're going to find out how smart it is ourselves, with a little installation and, of course, a review from the inside. The first component out of the box, and the only portion on the outside of the door is the key pad, which appears to have a solid metal construction and a couple internal Philips head screws holding the locking mechanism in place. The other chunk of the housing is what goes on the inside of the door, with the metal mounting plate and 3 screws holding the guts to the metal exterior. Now we don't have to worry much about this half of the lock because an intruder wouldn't have access since it's inside of the door...but we're still going to take it apart anyway. The guts come out cleanly enough. We have a rubber button used to control some of the alarm programming and the 4 internal double A batteries. It's nice that everything is self-contained and no exterior power is needed. It makes installing this lock a much more do-it-yourself project. The large black circle in the center of the board is the alarm speaker. So if the lock does feel itself being forced opened or jiggled, it can blast a shrill, high-pitched car alarm sounding noise into the house. So far, so good. It seems secure. There are a series of clips holding the motherboard to the plastic backing. Once that's pulled away we see a bunch of white gears, and the electric motor in charge of locking and unlocking the lock -whether it's from the correct key-code being entered, or tirelessly with the integrated smart-home system or phone app, which we'll test out in a second. For reference, this is the little motor inside of the smart padlock that I opened up in a previous video. There's a big size difference. The residential door lock is much larger and much more powerful. I'll clip the motherboard back in and plop the components back into the solid metal housing and get all the screws back in place. I'll get the batteries installed, and you can see here how the 2 parts sandwich together on either side of the door to make a working lock. One last look inside the exterior portion of the lock, the one that's most vulnerable, and we see that even under the plastic key pad it's just metal. If an intruder were to rip off the electronic keypad portion, they would have no access to the inside of the lock just metal. And as you can hear, the thing is pretty solid. We'll see what happens when we install it. Installation is pretty easy. I'll just remove the 2 screws holding the old, unintelligent lock in place, and then pull the deadbolt itself out from inside the door. The new bolt can be adjusted depending on the size of the hole. Mine needs to be fully extended, and the whole thing can be screwed into the door. The front housing gets set into the door, and the solid metal plate gets placed on the back, and the 2 beefy screws holding the parts together. I made sure to pull the keypad display ribbon through the slot in the metal plate so I can plug it into the computer guts on the backside of the door. The computer guts and the alarm portion slide onto the metal plate easy enough. There's a little hole for the locking mechanism, and then there are 2 screws, one large screw in the center and a little guiding screw up at the top. The speaker hole might look screw-able, but definitely don't stick anything in there it is a speaker and can be damaged. Everything seems to be working so far. To program the lock, there is a super important 6 digit number on the back side of the instructions, as we as written inside of the lock, and that number is used to program the thing. There is an app directly from the company dedicated to the operation of the lock, but we'll talk about that in a second. So from a hardware perspective, everything on this lock is working super smoothly. It only took me about 10 minutes to install, and all of the coding and programming internally in the lock is working great. From a hardware perspective, huge thumbs up. From a smart lock perspective...I'll get to that in a second. The nice thing about this lock is that it can hold 30 different key-code combinations, which is kind of like instead of having to remember a key every time you leave the house, you just remember your simple password. Works great for people who are running airbnb's, who have big families. You can reset the internal codes whenever you want. You could lose your keys...you won't lose your passwords. Lately it seems like we need passwords for everything, whether it's the latest social media apps, online platforms, or now your doorknob. It's getting hard to remember every single one of them. LastPass does have a solution for that. It is a free app, I'll link it down in the video description, that can remember all of your passwords for you. If you're like most people, you probably have one super simple password for everything, which is probably not the most secure way to do things. LastPass has the ability to generate and remember for you, super long secure passwords. And all of those passwords are encrypted, so only you can access them. Not even LastPass employees can see what they are because of that encryption. It is free to everyone, but for an extra 2 bucks a month you can get one gigabyte of encrypted storage. Only you can access and see those files that are stored in your drive. It has been downloaded by millions of people, so you don't have to take my word for it. Whether you just don't want to remember your passwords anymore, or you actually want the secure long encrypted passwords, there's always that link right in the video description. Huge thanks to LastPass for sponsoring this video. Back to the lock though, from a smart lock perspective from me, it gets a massive thumbs down. Like I said before, everything on the lock works perfectly. The hardware is great. It can't be physically hacked from the outside. But I was never able to connect my phone to the lock. I'm currently using a Galaxy S8 and it would never connect, even after a master reset on the lock itself, and I wasn't able to unlock the lock with my phone. Which is part of the bare bone smart lock capabilities you would expect from this piece of hardware. At first I thought it was just me, or maybe my lock was defective, but after reading the reviews, it is a widespread issue of this lock not being able to connect to cellphones. It's a big deal. And you would think that the lock would be smart all by itself, but if you wanted to connect it to an Amazon Alexa, or like a smart-home automated system, you have to have something called a hub which actually connects it via wi-fi. So by itself, it's not smart at all. And the thumbs down is the price. I paid massive smart lock pricing and received something that has no smart lock capabilities. So for a keypad lock, it's great. For a smart lock, it's not so great. I will continue my search for a smart lock better than this one. If you have any questions, go ahead and leave them down in the comments. And huge thanks to LastPass for sponsoring this video. I will leave that free link in the video description. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.",

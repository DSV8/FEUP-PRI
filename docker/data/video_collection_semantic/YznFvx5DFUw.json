    "transcript": "- We all make mistakes. (panel crashing) What, it blue-screened? Single graphics card! And when I built my personal gaming machine, I made a few. I bought a workstation CPU for no good reason. I hardlined water-cooled it, which has caused me hours of headaches. And I chose arguably the worst possible solution for storage, an 8TB software RAID 0 SSD array. They say, don't let your memes be dreams. You know what I say? Don't let them be your actual life. The good news is I have a chance to rectify all of that. In our epic tour of Micron's Idaho R&D facility, I had the honor of manufacturing my own custom memory modules, using engineering sample chips. But Micron's condition for that was that if they were gonna go to so much trouble, I had to actually daily drive them. But my system doesn't support DDR5. So, I guess I need a platform upgrade. Now, the Intel versus AMD question was settled already in our recent drag race, but it's taken until now to sort out all the other details and well, I guess I'll just put it this way. This is gonna be a very unconventional video, given that I'm actually downgrading the system in more ways than one. Just like I downgraded this segue to our sponsor. You see how low effort that was? - SignalRGB! With SignalRGB, you can control and sync your favorite RGB devices with a single easy to use app. Best of all, it's free. So download SignalRGB at the link in the video description. (bright music) - It makes sense to start with the very, no, not that, no. - [Plouffe] What are you trying to do? - It was supposed to go into place like that. - [Plouffe] All right. - That's what I meant to do, but I... Let's start with the very worst decision that I made. The 8TB RAID card. Unlike a conventional RAID card, the AORUS Gen4 AIC SSD doesn't actually contain any RAID logic on it. It just takes the 16 PCIe Gen4 lanes that come up through the slot here and then splits them up into four quad lane M.2 slots. The advantage of this approach is that it's economical, since you don't need an expensive controller on the board. But the disadvantage is that this card will only work on a motherboard that supports PCIe lane bifurcation, so the ability to take a slot and split it into more lower lane count slots. Now, some consumer motherboards support that, but it's most common on workstation and server boards. The other disadvantage is that because this is essentially just four independent drives, the only way to get them to operate together is using software RAID, meaning that you can't just take this card, plunk it in any system, and assume that it's going to boot up. As the eagle-eyed among you have probably noticed, that last bit is not necessarily a problem today, since I am sticking with AMD this time around. But it doesn't change the fact that this is not a very elegant solution, which means you're probably thinking one of two things right now. Either, \"Why did he do something so stupid when he knows it's stupid?\" Or, \"That April Fool's video is real and the guy's actually an idiot.\" And I wouldn't really blame you for either of them. The honest answer is that I 50% just wanted more capacity than you could get on a single M.2 at the time and the other 50% was straight memeing. I absolutely know better, but I mean, come on! When they said the PS5 SSD was faster than any PC SSD, they practically dared me to put one of these in my system. Also, I couldn't resist seeing the look on Jake's face. Now to introduce the new wife drive. This is the Sabrent 8TB Gen4 Plus. It's PCIe Gen4 x 4, rated for 7.1 and 6.6 GB/s read and writes, it's got the same 8TB capacity in a tiny little package like this, and I don't have to deal with any software RAID shenanigans. Yeah, this is much more sensible. We were worried that my software RAID setup would cause me one last inconvenience on my way out the door, but thankfully with a compatible board and an old copy of Paragon Disk Manager, we were able to make short work of it. This is actually booted to the new drive and we're ready to shut her down and move on with the build. Now, a funny thing we noticed during the migration is that based on the data rates, it seems like TRIM might not have been working properly, meaning that while the RAID card does use a full Gen4 x 16 slot, with 31.5 GB/s of theoretical bandwidth, that's twice the bandwidth of even a Gen5 M.2 slot, it was using basically none of it, meaning that our first downgrade, where I go from this to this, is probably going to improve performance. Now that we've got a sensible SSD that doesn't require 16 PCIe lanes off of the CPU, we can go with a much more sensible platform, the heart of which will be the Ryzen 9 7950X. With only 16 cores, this is our second technical downgrade. I was running a Threadripper 3960X before, which is a 24 core CPU. But the 3960X is Zen 2, while this uses AMD's shiny new Zen 4 architecture, meaning that even though the clock speeds are only a little bit higher, the real world performance, particularly in single-threaded applications like games, is a lot faster. Now, when we tested the 7950X versus Intel's Core I9-13900K, the gaming performance was basically neck and neck, meaning that when it came time to pick one, it came down to price. AMD has slashed the 7950X from its introductory price, all the way down to 600 US dollars. In the time since we did that video, it looks like Intel has followed suit, but we made the decision. I've got water blocks, and motherboards, and all that kind of stuff anyway, so I guess this is what we're doing. You're probably wondering, by the way, what's gonna happen to my old Threadripper? It's gonna be going into one of our editing workstations, since not only did AMD never provide an upgrade path for this platform, they aren't even producing any more chips for it, so they're really hard to get. Along with the price drop on the chips, the motherboards for Socket AM5 have become much more affordable. I mean, look at this, the X670E PG Lightning isn't cheap, it's 250 bucks, but that's still half the price, even a third of the price of some premium boards out there and has basically everything that you could need. 14 + 2 + 1 phase power design, 2.5 GB LAN, ample PCIe, and USB expansion, and perhaps most importantly for me, a Gen4 x 4 slot that's wired up directly to the PCIe lanes coming off of the CPU where I can install a Thunderbolt 4 card. I have kind of an unconventional setup at home with my PC in another room, and Thunderbolt allows me to have all the IO that I could want at my desk over a single cable. Haven't even got my board installed yet and I'm already stripping it down. I found something interesting. AMD's X670 Extreme Platform supports more PCIe lanes than their regular X670, and the way that they do that is they actually just wire up two of their motherboard chip sets in serial one after the other. The reason I came across this is this is my first in-detail AM5 build and I was trying to figure out where to put my SSD, so the way you do that is you check the block diagram for the motherboard and you're looking for whichever M.2 slots are wired up most directly to the CPU. I noticed the block diagrams that there were two chipsets, first one than the other, which means that if I were to use this slot or this slot, there's more potential bottlenecks as those PCIe lanes make their way back to the CPU, compared to this one and this one. Since this is a Gen4 drive, and I might wanna add a higher speed Gen5 drive in the future, I'm gonna go ahead and choose the slot that's wired up through only one chipset rather than the one that goes through two of them. It probably won't make any difference, but, you know, hey if you want to be a purist about it, then this is the best Gen4 x 4 slot on the board. This one also happens to be the only Gen4 slot that comes with a heat sink. Not, again, like that matters, but hey, it's there. Oh, next up we're doing water-cooling. Here we go. Holy crap, this thing is heavy. Apparently EK sent over their Quantum Velocity 2 D-RGB AM5 Full Nickel. Oh, that explains it. The bottom is machined out of pure electrolytic copper, and then unlike most blocks, which will have an acrylic top so you can see through them, the top is more nickel-plated copper. I don't know that I would recommend water-cooling these days. The price to performance just isn't there. But you can't deny the looks. And the advantage of this particular block is that it is designed for Socket AM5 and the die layout of Ryzen 7,000 specifically to provide optimal cooling. How do you tighten this? Is there supposed to be a backplate in here? I don't believe it, I think you have to disassemble the block in order to install it. - [David] No! - [Plouffe] What? No. - Look, I don't wanna believe it either. - [Plouffe] That can't be right. - I know, I know. You'd think I was just finding an excuse to talk about the high quality ratchet and included bits of the LTT store screwdriver, but no, I think I actually do need to do this. I've never met a water block I couldn't figure out how to install. I'm not about to start now. I'm taking my shot, my one shot, my one opportunity, mom's spaghetti right now. Yep. - [Plouffe] Oh, I see. - 'Cause I gotta install these. - [Plouffe] Yeah, yeah, yeah. I thought that, you know, there was gonna be more of this and these were going to be screwable into the backplate. I might have to look this up. Installing the water block, put it there, and then using the included T7 L-shaped wrench, fasten the- Wait, what? We brought Alex in as a consultant here to make sure that I'm not a complete idiot. Am I missing something here? - Yes. - Okay. In the meantime, let's talk memory. These are super weird modules. They are 24 gig modules, meaning that with two of them, which really is kind of optimal for AM5, I'll have a total of 48 GB/s of ram, my third downgrade from the 64 GB/s in my old system, but since they're DDR5, they should be substantially faster. How much faster? I don't know. Micron straight up memed the labels. And while I have run them before, I don't remember what they are so we'll find out once we boot it up. Of course, we're not gonna install them just like this. This is a gaming system, we need some heat spreaders. But not just any old heat spreaders will do. We settled on these matching blue, I have a bit of a theme going on here, matching blue heat spreaders from some ancient Micron fully-buffered DIMMS from back in the day. And there's a couple of reasons that we decided on an FBDIMM spreader. When I said there were a couple reasons for using these spreaders, there was actually just one reason. See this little raised bit in the middle here? That's to accommodate the buffer chip on these fully-buffered DIMMS. Now, DDR5 doesn't have a buffer chip, but what it does have is onboard power control so this is called the PMIC. And it seems to my eye like it's a little bit higher than the memory ICs themselves, meaning that I wanted a spreader that would account for that. Here's something I didn't really anticipate. The memory packages on this are a lot lower. Is this even gonna cover them? Also, DDR5 is touch wider. So if I can just... Wow, that's wild. Look how much this has faded. There's no ICs on the back of this module so probably it wouldn't do anything bad, but there's a possibility that it would short something if I put this on here like this. What I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna put like a thermal pad back there to help space it out. This thermal pad is very sticky, which is good. That's what it's supposed to do. Right there, yeah. Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good. Okay, now I'm just gonna try to hand bend this. Oh, yeah. Now, I just gotta put the clips on, stick this back on. Stealthy DDR 5. Nice! Yeah, we figured it out. This is how you turn it. Oh, and you turn it this way. So you're taking the screw and instead of screwing it in from the top, you are pulling it into the threads from the bottom with this little torques key. That means that our stock backplate on this motherboard was perfectly fine and everything was fine. All we needed to do was look more closely here. Please tell me this isn't cross-threaded. We're going to forge our own path here. New threads. Hopefully that was tight enough. That will have to be drilled out. This block is never coming off this board. Now that the board's all geared up, we are basically ready to do the upgrade. Well, it's not really... The weight distribution's not what I thought it was. Yeah, there's clearly still a lot of water in it though. Well, I don't know. You know what? Sure, how bad could this be? All right, easy-peasy. No problem. This is gonna be like the fastest system upgrade ever. Until we go to put in hard line tubing. Oh, yeah. Also, we're gonna need to water-block this card. I'm feeling good about this assembly of this card. It looks like it's just a handful of screws on the backplate and then more screws through the PCB and this cooler's just gonna pop right off. Please tell me it's easy to disassemble. Oh, I mean, there's some water, but that's fine. - [David] Nice! - [Linus] There was a spill at some point evidently. For those of you wondering, I am not gonna be changing the power supply and the reason is that this particular 80+ titanium unit from Seasonic, it's 1,000 watts. That's more than enough for a single GPU system, which is all anyone really does these days anyway so I'm just gonna go ahead and leave it alone. (upbeat music) - Blow harder. Okay. Oh, oh, yeah. - You told me to blow harder! - I was joking. - I'm following instructions. - Yeah, it's really going in the bucket. (upbeat music) - [Linus] It occurs to me that I don't know the exact height that that inlets at. - Oh. That's why I'm doing this. - Ah, okay. (upbeat music) - [Jake] And now, oh my gosh, it is close to being too long. Hey, look at that. Beautiful. - [Linus] We definitely took one shortcut, but in fairness to us, this is a really hard bend, so we didn't- But I think we're pretty much ready to cable, manage it up and go. Given the last time that I daily drove AMD was over 10 years ago, you guys are probably wondering what's the deal with the 7,900 XTX in the build? Well, there's a couple reasons for it. First, I'm in the middle of the AMD challenge so I'm going AMD, whether I like it or not. And second, why not AMD right now? I mean, yeah, it's still expensive, it's $1,000 for this card, but for the first time in a long time, AMD's not only competitive with the top offerings from Nvidia, but their driver improvements over the last few years have been unbelievable. So I've already had this card in my system for at least a couple of weeks. I just haven't had any issues with it. So by all means, you're welcome to stay, Radeon 7900 XTX. It might not look new, but it's kind of having a pretty new looking-vibe here, David. What do you think? - [David] It looks pretty nice. - Yeah. You know, I wasn't sure about that crusty blue memory, but I am loving it. - [Plouffe] It looks good. It fits all your cables and everything. - [Linus] It Looks awesome. - [Plouffe] Yeah, it looks like- - Oh, we didn't put in the Thunderbolt card. - [Plouffe] Yeah. Oh, and the 10 gig, did you put the 10 gig in? - No! - [Plouffe] Okay. So yeah, they're still here. - Dang it. There's still stuff for us to install. - [Plouffe] Okay.] Yeah. - Getting our hands on this guy was kind of a pain in the butt. They're sold out everywhere, so we had to go to eBay. But it's an essential component of my build because I use optical Thunderbolt cables to run my peripherals really far away from my tower. This is a Thunderbolt add-in card and it's using the latest Intel controller codename Maple Ridge, which I love, 'cause that's the town that I grew up in. Shout out, Maple Ridge! (staff cheering) Yeah, all right, anyway. The point is it adds two 40 GB per second Thunderbolt port, supports up to 27 watt charging, and you can use it to add Thunderbolt to any supported motherboard. And you might be thinking, \"Really, Thunderbolt on an AMD board?\" The answer is yes, not just USB 4, actual Thunderbolt, because the Intel Thunderbolt chip is this guy right here. And while motherboard manufacturers are super cagey about this, for some reason, if you dig into the specs for these add-in cards, they aren't Intel only, and you can find lots of AMD boards that support them, including this one right here. The main requirement is that while Thunderbolt is PCIe-based, so theoretically those four lanes are what we're using to get all the bandwidth out of these ports, the board has to have a special Thunderbolt header. So I just need to go ahead and plug this guy. Just like that. So much for cable management. And then it's weird, but this particular card calls for a second USB 2 connection to an internal header. Now, I already used up both of my USB 2 headers for my front panel connectors. But here's a perhaps little known trick. You can convert USB 3 to USB 2 by simply not using all of the extra pins. Boom. Oh, wow. That bottom PCIe 16 X slot is just 1X electrically. That explains why we couldn't use almost any of the 10 GB network cards that are out there because most of them use a by 4 interface, so a longer interface, which you could absolutely plug into one of these slots, but it would only be getting a quarter of its expected bandwidth. Oh, except this one from OWC, which uses a Gen4 x 1 interface, which happens to be just about the right amount for 10 GB networking. Let's go ahead and put this little guy in here. - [Plouffe] Are you gonna tell the people why you need 10 GB/s? - I mean, I don't need it. It's fast though. It's really fast. Two and a half gig is such a good middle ground these days. Okay, here we go. Let's fire it up. Wow. Those blocks look incredible. - Plouffe] You got a red light, hey? - [Linus] Oh, uh-oh. Are you kidding me? - [Plouffe] That's not good. I hope it's not RAM. Well, actually, I hope it is RAM. That's probably the easiest solution. - Why is it that every video we make turns into a troubleshooting video? - [Plouffe] Oh, it's posting! - What, what, what? - [Plouffe] Automatic repair. - Wait, automatic repair? - [Plouffe] Diagnosing. - [Linus] Diagnosing your pc. - [Plouffe] Hey, this is a lot better than the red light and no screen we got 20 seconds ago. No, we blue screened. - Sorry? - We blue- Inaccessible boot device. It's your drive. - We blue screened? - Yeah, and it's inaccessible boot device. - No! - It's your drive. This is why you don't set up your boot drive in the 4 x 2 RAID 0 configuration and then we transfer it to an 8TB sovereign drive. What was the point? There was none. - Take that, PlayStation. We've got a couple ideas for how to fix this. One is to just try the drive-cloning process again and see if maybe something went wrong. Another is to try the drive as is, but maybe enable AMD RAID in the BIOS and just see if it's something to do with trying to load the AMD RAID driver as it's trying to boot. Since that's faster, shy don't we do that first actually? All right, we're gonna try NVMe RAID mode. Oh. - [David] Yeah, it's working for sure. - [Linus] Nice. Yes! Oh, hey, what speed does this RAM run at? 5,600 CL 46? Not the fastest thing ever. But dammit, it might be slow, but dammit, it's mine. You know how sometimes a computer is not just fast, but it's like snappy and I can be like, boom, like I open Steam and then it's gonna be like, wow, connecting to your account. Boom, steam, let's go. Oh, why have I not configured this to not come up? It's like I hate myself. I am all AMD for the first time since I was 18 years old. Is that wild or what? Like they're not just competitive on one 'cause even in the dark times, they would occasionally be competitive on GPU or like kind of on CPU. But both? It's been so long. Casual 240 FPS in \"Halo Infinite.\" - [Plouffe] Make sure it's all cranked. - Yeah, let's turn it to 200% render scaling now. I mean, why not, right? 150 frames per second, \"Halo Infinite.\" 200%. We're running 4K, boys. Come on. Come on, come on, get back here, what are you- - [David] He's gonna be waiting for you. - [Linus] Where you going? - [Plouffe] Yeah, he's gonna turn around and kill you. - [Linus] He's not gonna melee nothing. I got him. Boom. And he wasted his rocket launcher. I consider that a win. A one-to-one trade where you take out the rocket launcher guy? - [David] I'm agreeing, I'm agreeing. - Okay, look, I play the objective, David. - [David] Just like the objective of this video is to segue to our sponsor. - That's not bad actually.

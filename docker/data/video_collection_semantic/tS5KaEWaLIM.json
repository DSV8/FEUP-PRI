    "transcript": "- We've got the brand new iPhone 10S and 10S Max, this the gold 512 gigabyte model. It's got a beautiful gold Apple logo here, gold iPhone on the side, before I open this I just wanna show you where we started from. This is the first iPhone box. Started from here, now we're here. What a beautiful family you have here. Okay, now we can open. (upbeat dance music) So much like most other iPhone unboxings, we've got our paperwork right here. Here they are. (gasp) Look at you. Even though I just saw these at the Apple event, having them here in my own home and in my own two hands... Some people say I overreact, I'm trying really hard not to overreact, maybe I'm not the one overreacting, maybe you're the ones underreacting. It's not my problem, it's your problem! Look at these beauties! This is such an incredible color, I just can't get over how perfect this gold is. I've been waiting for this gold since they started introducing gold phones, because every time they would introduce a gold phone I was like \"Eh, I like it, it's cool, but it's not the gold that I want.\" You guys remember I did have a gold phone previously, I had the iPhone 8 which was more of a blush tone, but then I did have, I think it was the iPhone 6. I actually got that one, I waited in line. Well there's nobody else here, surprise. The middle of nowhere in North Carolina. First in line for the phone. iPhone 6S. Line forms here. Oh this was the 6S that I got in gold. They are about the same size and form factor overall. A glass back. So this gold, I felt, was a little bit too yellow. So I feel like these colors are pretty similar, so this is the 8, this is the 10S Max, and I'm hoping that I can even give you guys a really good color demonstration. You can see that this 8 is a little more pinkish, whereas this has a really interesting, kind of like a holographic reflectiveness to it. I don't know if that's the technical term but that's what we're gonna call it. If you guys need a size comparison the 10S Max is about the same size as the Plus model phones. Just the regular 10S is about the same size as the iPhone 10. Let's see what else we have in the box. Ear pods, standard issue lightning cables, and power bricks. Aw man, I forgot, I didn't even actually need to use my knife. I brought out a beautiful gold knife for this unboxing. This knife looks to be a little bit too yellow gold. I don't wanna smudge this up but we've gotta do it. (spacey electronic music) My precious. I've still never seen Lord of the Rings. How many iPhone unboxings am I gonna make that joke, and not actually get the reference. (gasp) It's turning on. Okay while this is starting up, we've got another one. I just want to cradle it like a small child. It's so weird to have a huge phone again. Here we've got the Face ID all ready to set up, We've also got some cases. Oooh, this is Jenna's favorite color. Oh it's a nice leather smell. Now you can't even tell that I have a gold phone. I like the blue though cause it is a good compliment to the gold. Here's this brown leather case, I guess it's more of a tan color, the official name is saddle brown. Look at that, super classy. So some of the differences between the 10S and the 10 is obviously it comes in a much larger size, so this is the 10S Max, and the 10S, which looks very similar to the previous version. It has an A12 chip which is a much faster processor, so everything that you do on your phone will be a little bit faster. The back facing cameras have an all-new sensor, so this allows for faster auto-focus and improved low-light photos. The Super HDR feature is pretty cool. It captures a bunch of photos all at once, merges them together for the perfect shot. I also love the advanced portrait mode. You can adjust the aperture after you take a photo, so that background blur that everyone loves, you can set it to however much or however little you want. So essentially you should just be able to go out, push a button, and take an incredible picture. It's really taking the art out of being a photographer isn't it? Just push a button and voila, magic. Do I look like super... - Stop talking. - This looks so good! This looks so good! Half the time I end up taking iPhone pictures instead of using my expensive camera. It's easier and they end up looking just as good sometimes. I went a little more in-depth in some of the things that were announced in all of the new phones and the watches in my reaction video from the Apple event. Okay I'm gonna stop talking because I wanna take this thing out, get some cool slow-mo B-roll, cause you know, that's what I like to do. God, I love, such a sucker for slow-mo. (triumphant dance music) So we're now down here by the beach, I wanna test out some more of the slow-mo video, and because the sun is super harsh, this is gonna be the perfect situation to test out the smart HDR, and the new extended dynamic range in the video. Because it's so bright, the phone will automatically be able to adjust the highlights and the contrast, and merge everything all into one photo. So the photos in the video won't be too overexposed. (staccato rock music) I need to show you what Jenna's doing. - I'm making it work. - [Justine] This is great. - Someone else's trash, I'll throw it away afterwards. Okay, let's perform. - [Justine] Take some pictures! I just want to give you guys a quick demo of some of the apps using ARKit 2. I'm so excited for the future of AR, it's probably one of my most favorite things. So this app is called Night Sky, so basically it gives you an entire view over the world, stars, constellations, it will even show you the International Space Station. So, there it is, case you're wondering where it's at today. (gasp) There's a giraffe! This is so cool! (ethereal music) Let's see what other things we can do. Look at the solar system! \"Generate a Live Sky Tour for any location or time on Earth, simply choose a location.\" Okay, let's see what's happening in Cupertino. - [Computerized Male voice] Welcome to the sky tour for Cupertino over the next night. The stargazing conditions tonight will be good. Vulpecula constellation in zenith at 8:28 PM. - I never knew this is something that I needed. Ooh, listen to that bass. Alright, elemento. (beep) Elemen-tay-o? Tau, elemen-tau. (beep) So you can do multiple people in this, so if you click this you can create a room, so a bunch of people can also join in, but I clearly don't have any friends in here right now. This green scenery looks beautiful, let's do that. Okay we're gonna scan this surface. The whole table, yes! Here's my world. So we can look up. I think augmented reality is probably one of my favorite things. I like VR but I feel like VR takes you out of the element. I'm going inside now, like I'm seeing things. (low atmospheric music) Look, there's a ball over here. See the ball? - [Woman] Ooh, kick it! - [Justine] I don't know if I can kick it. What I can do is look around it, and look on top of it. I'm also screen-recording and doing this at the same time, so that's using up a lot of resources. (loud crack of thunder) Oh, what?! (loud crack of thunder) (deep gasp) No way! Look at this, there's fire here now. The app that we're gonna test out now is called Memrise, and this is a language learning app, so using AR, it'll identify objects that it sees, and it'll tell you how to say them in whatever language you're trying to learn. So, let's learn some new words. The potted plant. - [Computerized Female Voice] Die Topfpflanze. - Oh, come on now. - [Computerized Female Voice] Die Topfpflanze. - Die topfpflanze. Well next time I go to Germany, I'm gonna be sure to use my new word. Die topfpflanzia! (chuckles) It also thought that this potentially could be broccoli, which is incredible. - [Computerized Female Voice] Der Brokkoli. - I can say that. Der Brokkoli. - [Computerized Female Voice] Der Brokkoli. - This is freaking fun. - [Computerized Female Voice] Der Ofen. - Der ofen. What's this? The sink. - [Computerized Female Voice] Das Waschbecken. - Oh come on, das Washvicken? Oh, a refrigerator. Oh, it thinks it's a bookcase. (laughing) Let me back up. - [Computerized Female Voice] Der Kuhlschrank. - German is very, very difficult. - [Computerized Female Voice] Der Kuhlschrank. - Der Kooh-shank? - [Computerized Female Voice] Der Kuhlschrank. - I'm honestly trying. Ooh, let me take a picture of you. - What's it gonna think I am? It says Jenna? - [Computerized Female Voice] Die Person. - (laughs) It says you're a person. It's telling, it says die person. (laughs) - [Jenna] No that's there, that's the. - Yes, but in English. - [Jenna and Computerized Female Voice] Die Person. - [Jenna] That's me I'm die Person. - Die Person. Okay, what else is around here? - [Jenna] (singing) Dee dee ala. - (singing) Dee amala, dee amala, dee amala. It thinks it's soap? - [Jenna] Soap? - [Justine] It thinks it's a clock? - [Computerized Female Voice] Die Uhr. - [Jenna] Ooh let's go to the toilet! - Oh yes let's. - [Computerized Female Voice] Die Toilette. Die Toilette. - Die Toilette. - [Computerized Female Voice] Die Toilette. Die Toilette. - [Jenna] Alright, we're done now. - And this is cool too because you can go in here and so it kind of gives you an entire library of items, so if you want to go back and okay, why does it think that's a festival? - [Jenna] What does it think? Does it think-- - [Computerized Female Voice] Das Becken. - It thinks it's the remote control. Now it thinks it's a cellphone. Do you know how to say cellphone? - [Computerized Female Voice] Das Handy. - I am so excited about all of the fun AR apps that are coming out. Using ARKit 2, there's so many more things that can be implemented into AR so if you guys have any favorite AR apps, please leave those in the comments below and I look forward to seeing what you guys are into. How do you say new cellphone in German? - [Computerized Female Voice] Neues Handy. - Neues Handy. Neues Handy! They also said that the Face ID is faster because of the A12 chip, so let's test it out. So this notification, (chuckles) it's telling me to water my plants from 207 days ago. I don't even know how you're gonna be able to capture this but, ready? - [Jenna] Yep. - Oh it's definitely faster. (chill jazz music) Wow, wow it's faster, Jordan's gonna be so happy. Everybody tweet CaptainSparklez and tell him the iPhone 10S has faster Face ID. - [Jenna] He's not gonna get it, he just got the 10. - I know, but he wants faster Face ID. Thank you so much for watching, hope you guys enjoyed this iPhone 10 video, this is the first look and unboxing, and some of my favorite features. Of course, as you know, I will have plenty more videos for you guys, so be sure to subscribe, and of course hit the bell so you'll be alerted when I make new videos. If there's anything else that you would like to see me make videos about, whether it's iPhone or not iPhone, leave those in the comments below and I look forward to seeing what you guys have to say. So, I'll see you later. I'm dancing but there's no music, it's in my head. (chill jazz music)",

    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going Dave 2d here so Nvidia partnered with me for this video They're giving away a bunch of GTX 10 series gaming laptops And they actually sent this one out to me the amasai GSC to showcase what these laptops are capable of so these all have 10 series graphics cards inside them which is the current generation of graphics cards from Nvidia, and these are extremely powerful? These are literally Two and a half or three times more powerful than the previous generation that kind of jump in GPU perforins was never seen before so It's really cool that they had them this year this one in particular is a four pound machine. It's super powerful gtx 1070 120 hertz screen packed with lots of ram storage space and a light-up RGB keyboard so you can switch between four different zones It is a very powerful gaming laptop and very capable for doing other things like video editing and any kind of 3d Application or work on the go now two years ago This kind of technology just straight-up didn't exist if you wanted this kind of performance and this kind of power in any machine it would Have to be a desktop now You're able to play triple-a titles at like 60 90 frames per second 120 frames per second While being super portable this fits into your backpack and when you're ready to go just bust it out and do some work play some Games stream whatever you want the fact that I can bring this into a coffee shop Pull it out and just crush it and overwatch is just crazy this thing has enough power so you can play competitively in triple-a shooters on the go who doesn't want that now in videos give away a bunch of GTX 10 series laptops It's called the game ready everywhere contest that runs from November 27th for about a month I think it ends at the end of the year so December 31st I believe it's really simple to enter take a picture of your laptop in a place that you'd like to build to play games Post it on Twitter and tag me in it Dave TD TV as well as NVIDIA GeForce and add the hashtag Game ready everywhere and NVIDIA would choose two winners every week over the course of the month who will win GTX 10 series laptop So you'll be able to get something.

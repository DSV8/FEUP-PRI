    "transcript": "I was wrong about the oneplus 8 pro I really was you say to be completely transparent oneplus did say these devices a few weeks before launch and as I was playing around with them I wasn't really impressed with the camera performance I felt that it was running a beta version of the software something just didn't add up I mean especially for a $900 smartphone the photos looked abnormal as you can see it didn't process my skin tones accurately the dynamic range was really really bad and it lacked contrast however it did manage to capture true-to-life colors now oneplus did roll out a software update one week before lunch and they asked us to test these phones after that update but unfortunately on my sample I didn't notice a huge difference in the camera performance basically wasn't that great at all in fact if you caught my OnePlus 8 Pro hands-on video I compared to the 7 Pro and the 7T and the results were again really really weird but fast forward a couple days later post lunch and I get a notification on the pro its new update and supposedly it's set to improve system stability also fix a few bucks here and there and then under the camera update it's said that it was going to improve the camera shooting experience and stability I installed it right away woke up the next morning realized that it was a beautiful day outside and I decided to just go out for a walk now mind you I am still under quarantine I live in an area where there's not a lot of population so streets are empty and there's not a lot of interesting things to shoot but I came back home started reviewing these photos I shot only a pro and I just couldn't believe it I couldn't believe the results coming out of the smartphone it literally made the cameras on the 8 Pro go from worse to one of the best that I've ever tested as you can see the dynamic range is excellent there is great detail in every image that I took and that's thanks to that new Sony imx6 98 sensor I'm really surprised at how oneplus managed to deliver true life colors with great white balance the ultra wide-angle camera really surprised me well guys I mean it's a 48 megapixel sensor so basically they took the main sensor from the 7 Pro and jammed it into the a pro and give it a wider field of view and the results just look amazing you guys be the judge here and let me know what you think about these photos the telephoto lens produced amazing results I didn't notice any color shift between the three sensors and while telephoto might not be one of those features that a lot of people might use I myself find it useful especially as a photographer I like playing around with different focal lengths having that ultra wide wide and telephoto helps me experiment with different compositions and getting those lines straight just it just satisfies my inner soul if that that makes any sense it probably probably didn't but I just wanted it put it out there now one of the drawbacks of implementing a larger sensor into a smartphone is the plane of focus is so thin so it's difficult to get everything in focus I remember Marcus talking about this issue in one of his videos you see by default on the oneplus 8 Pro the main camera is a 48 megapixel sensor with an aperture of f17 that's wide open for a really large sensor so when you're shooting closer subjects the center is perfectly sharp but as soon as you examine the rest of the image you will start to see it blur it out nothing really is in focus and if you really think about it it's essentially portrait mode but in a more natural way without any software enhancements speaking of portrait mode yeah it's still not good I think Google and Apple are the only players getting that right I wouldn't even touch that option on the 8 pro the selfie camera has improved as well there's good detail color as well as good contrast low-light performance is surprisingly really good - that new Sony sensor doesn't give up on detail guys which is awesome and the dynamic range is still intact I even tried nightscape and the results were very much comparable to my pixel for yes that is a keyboard on top of my washer and dryer I just got to improvise somehow I mean hashtag quarantine life moving on to video quality I honestly can't complain guys I mean for a $900 smartphone this exactly meets those expectations it shoots 4k up to 60 frames per second and you can use the ultra wide-angle lens to shoot video as well HDR kicks in nicely to expose the highlights these were all shot handheld and they look like they were on a gimbal again this is all thanks to a is and OS Omni sensors so the results really do speak for themselves it's just too bad that oneplus wasn't able to finalize Omni camera software before lunch because that would have made it a little bit more easier but I'm finally glad that they were able to address some of the issues I had with a pro when it launched which was just this past week so that's that's all I have to say I mean it's just amazing to see a fascinating to see what software update can do to a smartphone camera it can either break it or make it even better so on that note thank you so much for watching also I am looking forward to that iPhone se to comments down below I am aware that Apple just announced a $39 smartphone it's awesome to see them getting into the mid-range smartphone market yeah that's that's all I got to say take it easy guys stay safe spend responsibly and I'll talk to you guys in the next one",

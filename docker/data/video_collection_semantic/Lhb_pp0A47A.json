    "transcript": "- Hello and welcome to This Is! We got more sus comments from Amazon and Wish and other reviews. - Matt and Austin, the sus captains for your viewing pleasure. - We're gonna hop right in. (claps) The first one is, \"yes it does the job\". If you're not familiar with this show, Kinsey has given us a whole bunch of reviews from Amazon or Wish or wherever they are might be. And we have to read these reviews and try and figure out what this is about. - What kind of psychopath rates something four stars? - Are you guys fully sitting down? - Uh. - Yes. Bolted in. (held back laughter) - [Matt] Your ears will get pregnant. Let's hope it's not in Texas. - I--Hold on, Hold on. Matt, let's just all absorb this image. Wish is a magical place. - It is. - Full of magical items, descriptions and questionable content, but \"your ears will get pregnant\" might be-- - And it does the job. Four stars. - Oh!!! I just got that! Ohhh no. - So that makes it so much worse. - I close my eyes. I still see \"your ears will get pregnant\" burned into my retinas. It's like when you stare at the sun. - That's so much better than what I have seared in my brain. (laughs) Cause I'm trying to figure out what a pregnant ear looks like. I'm gonna let you go first, because you tend to steal off of my-- - Sure, sure, sure. I--I'll take one for the team here. I'm gonna say it's not headphones. That's the low hanging fruit. - That is the lowest hanging fruit. Yeah. - And you don't want the low hanging fruit to get pregnant. - No. You want it nice and-- - No. You know what? We're gonna make a lot of sus jokes. Like no jokes here-- - I can't. I can't. - You can't make jokes on this. - I can't. - I'm gonna say it's a Bluetooth speaker and that it in fact does the job. Although, maybe not quite to this Level. - What I'm gonna say this is is one of those like camera... ear cleaner... - Oh! No! - Like... \"splooger\" thingies. That's supposed to clear-- - Wait! Wait, wait, wait, Matt. You're trying to tell me that you're using a \"splooger\" thingy to get your ear pregnant? Are you sure you want to rephrase that (incomprehensible)? - How do you get your ear pregnant? (awkward silence with lo-if beat in background) - [Kinsey] Austin gets a point for that one. (bell dinging, Matt groaning) - [Austin] Ayy! - It's an FM transmitter, but it is Bluetooth, and it does do speaker things. - Okay, I'll take the L on that one. - Can we just take a quick breather here? We started out very aggressive. After we've started with such a sus way-- - [Matt] Mhmm. - Of getting into this video. I think we need to find our inner peace and calm. - I need to shower after that first one. - We should probably take that together with! Item number two. (laughter) - [Matt] Absolute rubbish. - [Austin] No, no, no! I see a little union jack. - Ah. Yeah, yeah. - Gimme the accent. Gimme the accent. - [Matt] Absolute rubbish, isn't it? Thank you very much, Wish. Tam. (Austin cackling) Five stars. (Austin giggling) Right then. Ah, beans. (Austin cackles) Absolute rubbish. (scene cut beep) - So wait, let's think about this for a second. Five stars. What's five stars, terrible, but thank you very much? Like this has gotta be like some kind of gag or some kind of stupid...item. - Yeah. Yeah. - Do we get any other hints or we have to just go blindly on this one? - You might wanna cast this into Mount Doom. - It's the ring, right? - It is. - It's gotta be the ring. - If we both say the ring doesn't matter whether-- - How about, how much would you pay for the ring? - $3. With shipping. - This is free... - With $3 shipping, sure why not? - But you said $3. - With shipping! - I'm saying free with $3 shipping. - [Austin] Free! (bell dings) Bam! Who gets the point for that? - Ah beans. All right. (chuckles) Moving on to the next one. - Junk and can't return. One star. Slower than mole asses is in January. (Austin cackling) How are we supposed to guess literally any of these. - It's impossible. Is it like a... a crappy old computer? The fact that it's junk and can't return makes me think it's some kind of perishable item or something weird and niche that you cannot return. - I'm gonna take a wild stab at this. All right. - Okay. - [Matt] Magic Jack USB phone line adapter. - [Austin] Wow. That is incredibly specific. I'm gonna say this is some kind of food item that is like-- once you open the package you can't return it. - No, you can't just cast the widest net! - You just cast the smallest net in the history of nets. - We're supposed to guess what it is! - You're to catch a plankton right now. I'm trying to catch a blue whale. - [Matt] What?! (bell dings) But Matt, get the point. - [Austin] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hold on, hold on. 359.99 and free returns! This seems like user error and we were click baited. Why cant you not return this? I mean I agree, this is total junk. - Cause he spilled his orange soda on it. - Still. I think that-- (bell dings) - Four points to Matt. - Dude. That review is BS. You know what Matt? I'm fired up. - Yeah. All right. - I'm fired up right now. - No, well-- - I'm fired up right now. I just have to say I'm fired up. F-I-R-E-D space up. (explosion) I'm more fired up than Sonic the Hedgehog (laughs) - [Matt] It doesn't taste as good as it smells. - [Austin] I don't like that. - [Matt] I purchased this juice since it seemed like a pretty good value. Well it smelled amazing. It didn't taste at all like it was supposed to. I don't know if Covid altered my taste buds or what. - I actually think I know what this is but I'm gonna hold my guess to second. - This is some sort of like potpourri? Yeah. - Wow. Why are they tasting it? - Because they're an idiot. You're telling me an intelligent person like, \"I hate this; five stars. I'll buy it again\". - No, it smelled amazing, it just didn't taste like what it's supposed to. - Exactly, like potpourri. - They're saying it's a one off and they're giving it another try. - No, they're hoping it's a one off. I'm gonna say this is like, this is like a scent that like you're supposed to like put in like one of those like heated candle-- - But why are people eating it, Matt? - Because they're stupid! - I think this is frozen juice. Old orchard frozen juice. - Old orchard Frozen juice? - Old orchard. Yeah. So basically comes in like a little plastic thing like ye big. - Are you trying to explain to me concentrate? - Yeah exactly. Except-- - I grew up poor, too. - Yeah I know, it sucked! I'm glad I can drink Boss coffee now and not frozen juice I have to mix up in the morning when I'm thirsty. - [Matt] I don't know. I could, I could bath in the smells of blank and pregnant though. - You're pregnant maybe? - [Matt] Smelling it just hits (whip smacks) like when you eat something so good that you've been craving and it drops that dopamine. I mop at work four times a day. I'm sad you could-- You can't actually boil it or put it in the toilet tank. (grunts) you up. (grunts) your toilet up. (Austin cackles) I think if I had no common sense I would pour it all over my head, maybe? Pregnant lady getting pure dopamine hit from a scent. I am crazy. Yeah, I'm gonna change my thing. - Yeah. Yeah. - Cause I'm adjacent. This is like, this is like pine sol, like-- - I-I think so. Fabuloso is what I'm thinking. - But you said juice. You locked into your food. (simultaneously) Fabuloso! (bell dings) - [Austin] I even--I literally said the words Fabuloso. Come on, you gotta gimme something for that. - He said it was food. - But then we had the second one-- - No, he said it was concentrate. I said it was some sort of aromatic. - Give me something. I literally said Fabuloso. - After you were given the answer. - What? It was mopping and like-- - Kinsey agrees with me that I get 12 points. (bell dings) Moving on! If you were a teardrop in my eye for fear of losing you I would never cry. And if the golden sun should cease to shine its light, just one smile from you would make my whole world bright. - Matt. I've gotta shed a little tear. That was beautiful. - That was weirdly beautiful. (cut scene beep) All right, I am gonna go sus on this. - Oh no Matt! We've already been sus. We don't need you to go sus. - I think this is like a bong. (laughter) Or. - I don't think you're right on that. I'm gonna guess it's just like something like a necklace, a pendant, some jewelry of some kind. I can see like something like that. - [Kinsey] points for Austin. - [Matt] Oh! - [Austin] No! what is--Look, I've spent a lot of time on Wish. I'm not gonna do a victory lap early, Matthew, but I waste a lot of time on wish.com and I can smell what the wish.com is cooking. - I think I was right even though I see the answer in front of me. Great addition to smoothies, knees, stomach and children. - I don't like the way this one's going at all. - [Matt] I keep it in the shower so I can just open my mouth and put a scoop in without setting aside blank time because I'm here to succeed and time is money. Oh, it's a sigma. (shocked laughter) Blank also fits in old silly putty containers that have been washed out and then it just looks like you're carrying eggs in your pocket. Great way to avoid being punched unless someone wants eggs in their hand. Even so will probably not choose your pockets as the ones to punch there. If there are visible eggs in them. Remember we're the only ones so far that knows it's just blank in them so don't talk about it. - Guys, don't punch my egg pockets. It's like my dad taught me, and my jaw, hair, teeth, feet, thighs, Children-- - [Austin] Ah! What?! - [Matt] Are happy well because blank pockets are not sticky Like regular blank and can be carried in two ways, Mentioned above. Pockets and shower mouths. - Oh! Stop! Stop! - I apologize to every one of our fans. if we try to think about this seriously, we can maybe work something out, but I've lost so many brain cells reading this that I don't think I can. - It's all over the place. - Can I say it's like potpourri or something. It's something dumb. Oh wait, no candy. Candy. Right. Smoothies you can put candy in. Knees, not so much, but your stomach can put candy in and children can eat candy. I got three of the four. I'm go with candy. - It's like super long reusable gum. - Excuse me. - It yeah, it's like, oh, like you buy like you only have to buy one container ever. - So gum or potpourri? - [Kinsey] Peanut butter powder time. Peanut butter powder-- - [Matt] This is just protein powder. Who gets the point on that? - I got candy. You already got, you gave yourself 12 points for no reason earlier. Do you really need to argue this one? - I just don't think this is candy. - What? Okay, what did you say again? Candy could be like pixie sticks. - Yeah - You're a pixie stick. - Wow, that's rude. You should apologize. - I'm sorry that wasn't a very good insult but I'll think of a better one. - A soft wedge. Slightly too small to fill my hand properly. - [Austin] Man, if I had a nickel. - [Matt] This sensual looking beautiful blank might work for someone with smaller hands than mine but my giant hands can't seem to feel satisfied feeling the shape of this blank. If it were slightly larger or longer, it would feel much more satisfying. Or if there was an adjustable length to bring the back of the blank farther back into my palm. Bringing a tighter sense of unity and a more solid connection between fondler and fondle r's fantasy world interface unit. Okay, so I at least know who wrote this cuz it's my ex-wife, Julia. (shock and laughter) - Is passing an option? - [Matt] We Just had a birthday mystery tech for you. - [Austin] Yeah. - [Matt] and I think that this-- - [Austin] Noooo. - [Matt] The personal massager that Karen got you. - It's like some kinda like fidget toy. I think it's some kind of fidget toy. This is a sus review to make it seem a little too exciting. I think it's some kind of fidget toy, like something poppy, something fidgety. - No's make it's makeup sponge. - What are you doing to us here? - The anchor ergonomic optical USB wired vertical mouse. Do you not think that makeup sponges was a good guess? No. - I just gonna say that if you write reviews like this seek professional help at once because clearly Matt and I need professional help now - As well. Guys, have a drink of water. Okay, you're - Clear. Cold shower, maybe - Coldest of showers. - Cut some grass. I've heard that's helpful. - Well you got, I mean these people probably shouldn't be fondling anything exactly as described. It was exactly what it was described to be crunchy a little earthy, rainy taste and creamy, earthy rainy taste was subtle. Not too strong. That is what subtle means. No chemical taste whatsoever. I eat curle and chalk so I would know what chemicals taste - Like. Oh no, it's a curve ball as we say in the industry. We've done a lot of these episodes. This is the most unhinged one yet by a long shot. The crail of chalk feels like it is a just a, a red herring. This person is a lunatic and they drink, they eat chalk. - I'm holding my cards closer to the chest one. This one. Okay. Alright - Alright, alright. I'm gonna go with my gut. I'm just gonna say peanut butter. The only thing in the history of the universe which ever has ever been both crunchy and creamy is peanut butter. Now I don't know why it's earthy and rainy, but - Sure. I'm saying this is straight up crayons. - What you're getting sucked in by the red herring of the eating creole Crayola chalk - Where you see a red herring. I see the telltale sign of look. They capitalized it. Yeah. All right. Yeah. Yeah, that's, That means they care. - They do. They do care. They they good grammar, good punctuation. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. You might be convincing me that this some lunatic who eats crayons and other things. Is this like a green crayon or - Something? If you, you bite into a crayon which you should not do for record. That's, there's your crunch, but it's - Oh - No, the warmth that's - Convincing me. - No, the warmth of your mouth starts to kind of melt the wax a little bit and it gets creamy. Oh. This is a 64 pack of frail back to school special crayons. Grandma. What? Grandma's white dirt is the original Georgia white dirt that your mama told you about. My mother never told me about Georgia white dirt. - Grandma got her Georgia white dirt out to eat. Is this - Food? - It says flavor. Dude, you shouldn't eat dirt, but I guess some weird - We need Joanna in here to for some southern, like a aorist. Are - You trying to insinuate the Joanna used dirt? - I don't know. - This is dark, man. This is dark. I don't like where this episode is taken. - Us grandma, are you okay? Text 4 2 2, hashtag six to let us know. Please - Subscribe to the channel. Yeah. Matt and I are doing permanent damage to ourselves by reading these reviews and Kenzie - Is the - Culprit.",

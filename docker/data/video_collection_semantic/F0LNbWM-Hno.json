    "transcript": "I don't know is it just me or a gaming keyboards becoming way too expensive definitely not just me what's up guys I'm Dimitri's harken accent today we have a really interesting keyboard from Logitech that g915 lightspeed Wireless I feel like Logitech is setting the new standard for what the low-profile keyboard should be in terms of the bass in terms of the switches and the key caps and they've done a lot of things right with this board and despite my favoritism towards tkl boards you know because this thing is absolutely massive I don't like that form factor but many people do in terms of our Twitter poll as you can see here majority of people prefer still full-size gaming ports for gaming and also an interesting fact the sales for full-size boards versus TTL are like 90 percent for a full sized board from Logitech so it makes sense for them to focus on larger boards that people will actually buy instead of catering towards the really loud minority that want ekl including myself and I am hoping that we'll see a low-profile tql version of this but right now full-size makes sense in terms of what large Tech's selling and what are people requesting oh there we go this is the excel I'm looking for welcome the O 11 excel by Liam Lee stepping it up with upgrades all around for enthusiasts builds with perfect radiator spacing in the bottom on the side and the top with now a slightly wider main chamber for taller GPUs and rear exhaust area the second chamber will hide all your cables and house hot swappable drives for a complete package all around this is the 11 excel by Bailey giving you room to grow as you guessed it based on the intro the price point I would say is the caveat and would be the main turnoff from the mainstream consumer market because of $250 it's expensive the g8 5 which is the wired version is $199 and has a USB pass-through port and is not wireless so the wireless convenience is the $50 premium now I want to focus my attention on the low profile nature of something like this because they've done a fantastic job in terms of minimizing the actual frame size at the bottom and that is because of the new GL switches they come in three flavors the linear the tactile and the clicky as you can see in this shot here we have the low profile switch on the right and height differences pretty significant versus your standard mechanical switch on the left and that is what allows them to create something that profile like the G915 or G815 these have been co-developed with kale and it's great to have three variations of this type of switch right at the start but kale also has their own variations of the switch that will hopefully see more widely available in other keyboards to this whole low profile movement is starting to grow as for the specs they all have a 50 gram actuation force 1.5 millimeter actuation point and 2.7 million or travel distance and that for a low profile keyboard is pretty incredible for your tactile and clicky switches it feels really nice while on the linear switch I'm almost expecting for it to be a little bit more travel distance because I'm guessing I'm used to that as for the actual based on the keyboard it is thinner than my iPhone with a case on it which is pretty incredible I do like the aluminum frame and the little curved side lines but the edges of the frame are really sharp so if you're doing any flicks just be careful with the thumbs because it might be painful now some of you may be thinking what's the point of a low profile keyboard when the bass and the actual footprint is so large and I agree with you in comparison to my ducky 1/2 SF like this thing is like more than 2x2 size and that's pretty much because we have additional G keys on the left side we have five them so you can record macros and stuff and the actual forehead of the keyboard is pretty tall to accommodate those additional keys like your profile switches your macro key the connectivity and the lighting and the gaming key and just to give you a comparison how thin the keyboard is here is next to the ducky 1/2 SF which is pretty low profile in my opinion and here it is next to the apex Pro which is like the larger and taller but we do have two height adjustments on the G915 and it puts it in the same height where the back is to like your standard mechanical keyboard it does give you a nice high elevation toe for typing when it's completely flat it almost like feels like it's built into the desk but when you've raised it on that maximum level it gives you a nice angle of adjustments and typing it's nice also because of this you do not need the wrist rest because the bottom keys are so low to the desk that when they were trying to see if you need the wrist rest it would actually cause you fatigue and discomfort so the desk is your wrist rest I do like the dedicated media controls on the right side plus a very smooth volume wheel that has no tactility whatsoever and it seems like there's a bit of delay between when you actually touch the volume wheel and when that volume appears on-screen and windows and you can play around with it and see the volume wheel catching up to whatever you set it to as for the key caps they're incredibly low profile and that is the third point that made the whole low profile nature of this keyboard so good the frame the switch and the key cap many of you probably expecting pvt key caps for this price point they're not however they're extremely solid and sturdy there's no flex whatsoever we have the main key that is shine through and it's beautiful nation because of the LED that is right underneath it however the second characters are not shine through therefore they're left blank which is kind of nice because there is no gradient in the illumination the issue with the key caps over is that they're almost proprietary and finding replacements is not easy especially right now with this whole early movement of low profile keyboards and the switches in particular and unfortunately I broke one of the legs on the key cap when I was inserting it back into the switch very gently I heard a snap my god no and unfortunately the N key is now super wobbly has no stability whatsoever without one of the legs on it interestingly large stick tells me they've never had one break in their own internal testing so that's kind of interesting and if that happens to you if you are replacing key caps or like removing them for cleaning or something that they do have support to send out replacement keys that you can purchase yourself just keep that in mind by the way I love the font super clean nice boldness this is the way forward for gaming boards he also tell us they have a special coating on top of the key caps to prevent them from wearing out the top layer because of finger oils I'll keep you guys updated in a few from now make sure to follow us on social media so the lighting is absolutely beautiful super bright vibrant color accurate to what you set the software which is awesome and my only complaint here would be the m12 m3 keys which are your profiles and they are set to yellow and they're constantly yellow and they don't correspond to user set color you power on the keyboard with a switch in the top left you charge it with a mic USB port and top right no type-c however and the battery life on this thing is absolutely insane you're looking about 1200 hours of continuous usage without any lighting on and the lighting here of course is the culprit for killing battery life at full brightness you're looking about 30 hours of continuous usage or like you know a full week on normal basis we do have the brick with a low profile USB receiver that has the G 9:15 text on it which is great and when you need to charge your simply unplug the cable plug it into a keyboard and the whole system is designed for that receiver to remain somewhere in the vicinity of the keyboard because when you need that microUSB cable you can simply plug it in so the wireless aspect is super fantastic especially for keyboard that large not having a cable to worry about is great of course that comes with the price but we also have a Bluetooth mode for connecting to other devices connected to my iPhone literally without any issues so I can switch between Bluetooth and 2.4 gigahertz on my computer without any issues with a simple click of a button I do like that we have a macro key on the keyboard itself so you click that you select which G key you want first you type in your command and you click the macro key in once again to record that macro to the G key super simple on-the-fly macro recording without needing the software and speaking of the software I really enjoy G Hub nice and simple UI navigation in terms of setting your presets or customizing your lighting / key and key assignments we can further customize what those G macro Keys do and then the game mode interestingly you can disable other keys outside your windows key in case you accidentally constantly pressing them and you don't want to have them be registered in game this is something you can do now and so the keyboard and it's full state I feel like is a really good low profile example on the market in terms of the frame the switches the key caps I don't appreciate the large form factor I'd like it to be smaller to complement the whole compact but that's just my bias let me know if you agree my only complaint here with the key cap legs where one of them broke and I don't know how I was very gentle with it and the replacements are not easily found and the volume wheel man this thing is just it doesn't have any tactility to it and there's that weird lag in Windows I do appreciate the game mode and disabling certain keys outside of your Windows key and the only thing that I don't like about the frame are the really sharp corners because of the aluminum frame and where it meets that plastic frame as well I wish that was rounded instead of the side lines being rounded in terms of the switches I love the tactile and the clicky for gaming the clicking one in particular it feels like a softer Razer green switch the clicky point is soft but it's very pronounced while the Browns feel really nice as well I'm just really used to browns while the linear I feel like for my game style I prefer to have a bit more travel distance for linear switch for my game style but it's nice to have all three flavors available the new Hydra X series from Corsair is a full water cooling ecosystem with transparent blocks for RGB goodness and built-in flow indicators with soft and heart tubing available and the full array of fittings so you can design the perfect loop for you hide your X by Corsair everything is linked below and so it really comes down to whether or not you want such a low-profile keyboard that is also massive it's kind of like a catch-22 but hopefully more custom keycaps will be available in the market that you can swap these out in case they break and yeah I'm a Dmitry thanks so much for watching I am pleased with this one except for it's not from my play style in terms of being so large but the switches the switches I like thanks so much for watching make sure to check out this other relevant content I'll see you guys in the next video you",

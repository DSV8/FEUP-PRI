    "transcript": "If youve ever wondered how street lights knowthat its dark outside, well theres a good chance its thanks to one of these. This is a photocelllight control. It has a light sensor on its side and a few electrical connections on the bottom, and when wired appropriately into a light fixture, it will prevent that light from coming on whenthe suns up (and turn it on when the sun sets). But how exactly is it doing that? Simplysaying a light sensor turns the light off doesnt really explain whats actually going on inside ofhere, does it? After all, what even is a sensor? Perhaps that sounds like a sillyquestion, but the thing inside of this that actually turns on and offthe light it controls is a thermostat. Yeah, this thing is a little more rube-goldbergythan it might seem at first glance. The actual light sensing doodad is likely a familiar sight. Take a look at a common night light and youll find a smaller but very similar looking componentunder this bit of clear plastic. The squiggly dark orange line through a shiny metal plate isthe tell-tale of a photoresistor, an electronic component also known as a light-dependent resistoror LDR. As its name might suggest, the electrical resistance of this component changes based on the amount of light that hits it. We can see this in action if I take this apart and hook up a multimeter. Notice that as more light hits the photoresistor, themeasured resistance decreases. In other words, the more light that hits it, the more easilyelectric current can flow through this component. You might have realized that this is backwards to the goal of a nightlight - the nightlight should comeon when its dark, and the photoresistor on its own would make it harder to light thebulb at night and easier during the day. Accordingly, the photoresistor is only partof the equation - hence the circuit board. In addition to the photoresistor, theres also an ordinary resistor and a thyristor. This trio of istors is what actually makesthe circuit function. Power flows in from the live pin and up through this bit of copper which passes for a lamp holder these days. Once its made it through the filament ofthe incandescent bulb, it comes back down this other bit of copper and hits one side of thethyristor. That thyristor is a semiconductor which serves both as a diode (meaning it only allowscurrent to flow through it in one direction, which, fun fact, has the side-effectof only running the lamp at half-power whichll greatly extend its life) but also, andmore importantly, it serves as a power switch, interrupting the circuit and preventing the lampfrom lighting unless it sees a control input. This is pretty confusing to look at so Ivedrawn this as a circuit diagram. What we really have here is an ordinary lamp circuit with the thyristor interrupting it in the middle. As drawn, this would never light the bulb. Butif we provide an input by way of a bit of current flowing to the gate of the thyristor, thatsits middle pin, then it will relax and allow current to flow from one side to the other, whichwill complete the circuit and light the lamp. That activation current comes from the resistorhere. It provides a path for current to flow between this point and the thyristorsgate. With this in the circuit by itself, now the light will never go out (assuming thebulb isnt burnt out). The resistor will always provide enough current for the thyristorto activate and allow the light to turn on. However, that resistor is a 2megaohm resistor. It lets a tiny, tiny amount of current through itself, in factbarely enough to activate the thyristor. It would thus be very easy to disrupt that input, which is precisely what the photoresistor is for. Notice that its connected between the neutralpin of the plug and this point here. When its dark enough, the resistance of the photoresistoris sufficiently high to where it doesnt affect anything about the circuit and the lamp lights. But when light hitsit, its resistance falls. Once its low enough, it provides an alternative path for that activationcurrent coming from the resistor to take, so that current bypasses the thyristors gateand the lamp doesn't light. It's pretty simple. Because of the way this circuit works, somecurrent is always flowing - but its hardly any at all. That 2 megaohm resistor, at 120V,dissipates a whole 0.0072 watts. And thats assuming it's wired directly to neutral. Which it isnt - its in series with the lamp filament, which adds another 400 ohms or so. The thyristorneeds absolutely miniscule amounts of current to become activated, so while this circuit istechnically drawing a little power during the day, its practically zero. Also noteworthy, thyristorsexhibit a sort-of latching behavior and, once activated with sufficientcurrent flowing through the gate, stay activated until the zero-crossing of the ACpower cycle. This is why the lamp will fade to life as it gets dark rather than just snap to full brightness. When most but not all of the activation current bypasses through the photoresistor, thethyristor will periodically kick the lamp to life at the tail end of each power cycle, behaving much like a dimmer switch does. This circuit is really quite elegant and it worksjust fine for controlling a tiny little light bulb. But its not enough to control a street light which might have a lightbulb like this - and this thing draws 1,000 watts. For this, youre gonnaneed something a lot more robust. Like the thing I showed you at the beginning. This light controlcan interrupt the full 15 amps of a standard US lighting circuit, and in fact is even rated for up to277 volts. This style, with its twist-lock plug, is commonly used atop individual light fixtures and meant for easy replacement, but theyre also available in little modules like this that you wire into whatever you want to control. There are two important things to note about thesethings: First, the photoresistors on them are a lot larger than what we see in the nightlight. And second,both of them have three electrical connections. Theres the incoming power, the switched outgoingpower, and neutral as well. That tells us that the photocontrols operate independently of the loadsthey control, and likely consume a little bit of power themselves. Now you might think that theres somesort of logic circuitry in these things controlling a relay or something, but their operation is in fact much simpler than that. Lets pop the cover off this one. Its pretty empty in here, isnt it? We justhave the photoresistor on a little mounting plate, then some kind of component touching a smallcircuit board. Its clear that this component is the actual switch as it has fairly large wiresconnected to either side of it, but what do you suppose is going on beneath it? That littleboard has a lead going to the incoming power, and another going to the photoresistor. Then theother side of the photoresistor is wired straight to the neutral pin. To get a better idea of whatsgoing on, lets remove that mystery component. Betcha didnt think wed findthermal paste in this thing, did ya? If youve ever done any sort of appliancerepair, you might recognize this thing. This is a thermostatic switch. Normallyits closed and will allow power to flow through. But inside of it theres a bimetallic disc whichwill deform as temperature rises. [click] Once its past a certain temperature, that discwill snap and open the switch contacts inside. You often find these used as safety switchesin appliances that produce a lot of heat,like clothes dryers or gas-fired furnaces. In thoseapplications they might be called limit switches, and theyre designed to shut theappliance down if things are getting too hot. Whats it doing in here? Well, before I removedit it was pressing against this little circuit board with a little thermal paste in between. That circuit board has nothing on it but a couple of surface-mount resistors (as wellas a PTC thermistor to serve as a fuse, but thats not important right now). Thoseresistors are doing the simplest job a resistor can possibly do - produce heat. Thats right,this circuit board is functioning as a heater. Surface mount resistors are certainlyan unconventional heating element, but thats what theyre doing and theyre doing a bang-up job, too, so dont judge. But notice how that heater circuit is wired. Itsacross live and neutral, but it makes a little diversion through our friend the photoresistor. Knowing what weve learned about photoresistors, think about what that would do. If I wire thisup and we take a look with a thermal camera, in a dark room we can see that the heater is on, but its just a little warm. Its trying to heat up, but the photoresistor is in a state of high resistance, preventing power from flowing. When I shine a light onto the photoresistor, though, itsresistance falls and the heater immediately gets warmer - in fact it gets pretty hot. So wehave a heater circuit that gets hotter when more light hits this thing, and we have a limitswitch that opens a circuit when it gets too hot. I wonder what would happen if we put them toget oh, right, that's how it was when I got it. With it reassembled, heres what we see in thethermal camera. Again, when powered on in the dark, we can see the faintest little hot-spot. But when I shine a light on the photoresistor, that hot spot gets bigger and... hot. The resistors onthat board are dissipating about 2.5 watts, and the thermal paste is transferring thatheat energy into the face of the thermal switch. The switch remains closed for about 2minutes, but eventually [click] it opens. One thing to note is that the photoresistoris also a resistor in the circuit so it, too, dissipates a bit of heat. However, the big metal plate its mounted on doubles as a heat sink, soits barely visible to the thermal camera. Ive wired up this totally-legit streetlightin a definitely-not-sketchy fashion to provide a demonstration of the photocontrol in action. Right now, the sun is up, so the photoresistor is letting enough current through to keep the heaterpowered and the thermostatic switch nice and toasty. But as we approach sundown, the heaterslowly loses power as the photoresistorsresistance increases, and thus its heatoutput falls. In this... simulated sunset, the heater instantly shuts off, but it takes awhile for the thermostatic switch to cool down. Once it does, the switch will close, andthe light turns on. [click] Ah, there we are. The delay is actually quite useful, especiallyfor lighting technologies like the high pressure sodium lamp you see here. Ideally, you want to minimizethe number of times these lamps start up, and the varying lighting conditions as the sun rises andsets could result in some wild behavior at dawn and dusk. The thermal mass of the thermostaticswitch, along with its deadband between activation temperatures, provides the perfect combinationof delay factors to ensure the light it controls doesnt behave erratically. Some people would really likeme to say the word hysteresis. Youre welcome! Now, earlier I said the resistors in here dissipateabout 2 and a half watts. That means that, ironically, this thing consumes power in orderto save power. Since the smallest lamp one of these might control is about 50 watts, its stilldefinitely worth having one of these. [click] But putting one on top of every light fixture doesnt alwaysmake sense. Not only does that make each light fixture more expensive, but it also means everysingle one is consuming a little bit of power all the time and that adds up. So in many cases, banksof streetlights are wired to a central location, and a single one of these things is used tocontrol a contactor at the distribution point. The fact that these need power to turn thingsoff also adds a fun little side-effect. The switch inside closes becausethe heater stopped heating, which usually happens because the sun set, butthats not the only reason it can happen! If, for example, there's a power outageduring the day, the switches inside every one of these things will cool down and close within just afew minutes despite the sun shining brightly. So when power comes back on, all thosestreetlights (and anything else controlled by one of these) will also come on for a minuteor two before the internal heater warms up enough to shut them off again. I mean, its prettyinconsequential, really, but its still fun. Something notable about this photocontrolis that its design is actually quite a bitdifferent from designs of the past, which you canperhaps tell by the massive lack of stuff inside of it. This is an old, standardized form-factor sothe casing didnt change but older versions often had something similar to what we find inside this wire-in module. In practice, this is the same exact thing, with a photoresistor wired in-series with a resistor that acts as a heater, onlyallowing that heater to function during theday. But instead of heating an off-the-shelflimit switch, it heats this bimetallic bar. As it warms up, the bar starts bending downwardand applying force to a spring-loaded switchcontact through this screw. Once its warmenough (and thus bent enough), that switch contact snaps open. And on this particular module, it barely opens. Which is actually pretty disconcerting. But whatever, once the sun sets and the photoresistor restricts flow through theheater, the bar starts to cool back down, move back to its original shape, and eventuallythe switch contacts snap together again. Older versions of this puck-style twist-lock thingamajig often had a very similar mechanism to this inside, perhaps with more robust contacts for handling the inductive load of a big magnetic ballast. Its not much of a surprise that thisnew one uses a limit switch, honestly, because thats an off-the-shelf part used ingajillions of applications. The bimetallic bendy switch mechanism with a resistor taped to the bar needs purpose-built parts. It also seems rather fiddly to put together, and it looks as though thescrew tension needed calibration in the factory. This design, on the other hand, is athree-component circuit board whichprobably cost a few pennies, a dab of thermalpaste, an off-the-shelf limit switch, and some screws. Wire in the photoresistor and youre done. Is this as robust as the old designs? Who knows. But this surely isnt the only way to handlethis, is it? I mean, with microprocessor chips cheap as chips these days, wouldnt a littlecode running on a microcontroller powering a relay make more sense than a heater running allday just to keep a thermostatic switch open? Well, take a look at this little fella. Its like a baby version of the other one! And its photoresistor looks pretty small, not much bigger than the night lights. Lets take a look inside. Oh. It literallyis just a baby version of the other one. That actually surprised me quite a lot, butI guess it proves that if it aint broke Perhaps there are more power-efficient waysto handle this task, in fact Im certain there are. But, they all have trade-offs. Any solution involving amicrocontroller is gonna need its own power supply to function which adds costs. And then youre gonna be sticking that thing on top of a light pole with the sun beatingdown on it day after day. Capacitors tend to not like that. Plus, then youre gonna need to figureout a way to introduce hysteresis in software, and if theres one thing I know aboutsoftware, its [sound locks up] pre ee, and oft half baked. There is definitely something to be said fora simple solution like this, and besides, the power they consume is minimal - especiallywhen you use one to control 100 light poles. What I think is most interesting about thesethings is they are a perfect demonstration of how to turn an electronic component intosomething thats actually useful. Its one thing to learn what a photoresistor does, andquite another to make something happen with it. And theres more than one way to go about it! Thenightlight shows an elegant semiconductor-based solution for low-power applications. And whileturning a heater on and off with the sun might seem pretty off-the-wall, when you know that bimetallicstrips get all bendy when they heat up, that presents an opportunityfor actuating a switch. All that it takes to turn that into a usefulproduct is for someone to make the connection. painfully smooth jazz The thing inside of here hooh Youre gonna need something a lot more robust. Like the thing I showedyou [clunk] at the begin--- crap! [frustration noises] ...and the lamp lights. Butwhen light falls on it, its resistance falls. When Surface-mount resistors are certainly an unconventional heating element but they're, but With a photoresistor wiredin series with a res -- crap! However, that resist... However,that resistor is a two however, maaahhhh What I think is most. What I [clears throat] What I think is ppppbbblb All it takes is to turn that haaaaaaa What's going on inside these things is weirder than you thought, huh? Just like the title said. I didn't really know how they work, but when I realized the light would turn on the heater, it clicked. Both conceptually, and because the switch opened.",

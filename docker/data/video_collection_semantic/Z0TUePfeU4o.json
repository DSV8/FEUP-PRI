    "transcript": "what's up everyone Eber here with Hardware Canucks and today we're testing out the Ryzen 5 2600X a processor that many of you are requesting me to benchmark and compared to its older brother the Ryzen 7 2700X as you may know AMD recently announced their second generation Ryzen processors along with the x470 platform so I decided to put this $230 6 core twelve threaded beast of a CPU through its paces so let's find out how well it performs okay so before I get to the performance results on the 2600X I want to quickly go over its specs this is a six core processor featuring 12 threads comes with a base clock of 3.6 gigahertz with a boost up to 4.2 AMD has also included a write spire cooler out of the box unfortunately it does not feature any RGB lighting but considering the $230 price tag on the CPU this is an absolute steal in my opinion now my test bench hasn't changed from last week's second gen Ryzen 7 review I'm still rocking the MSI X470 gaming motherboard 16 gigabytes of G skills Sniper X ddr4 memory clocked at 3400 megahertz and a reference GTX 1080 ti as for cooling I'll be using the included great spire cooler to see how well it can cool the 2600X perhaps play around with overclocking to see how far I can push the thermal limits after playing around with a core voltage and clock speeds for a while through AMD's Ryzen master software I did manage to get a stable four point one five gigahertz at one point four to five volts the sad news is that I wasn't able to achieve this with the rate spike over so I ended up using the noctua D15 now I do want to point out a few things that I noticed while testing the 2600X at stock settings you see under idle tasks or light low scenarios like browsing the web or watching content etc the CPU core speed fluctuated between four to four point two gigahertz which is it's rated to turbo speed and this was with all six cores I'll be it I did notice one or two out of the six cores clots slightly lower than three gigahertz but I think this has to do with XF r2 and the way how the algorithm works under load I notice clock speeds hitting as far as 3.9 gigahertz on all cores and this kind of makes sense because once again X so far to detects the thermal Headroom that your cooler has and then it would automatically adjust stock speeds so if you install an aftermarket cooling solution those frequencies can obviously boost up to four point one to four point two gears because it's obviously a lot more superior than the included stock cooler speaking of the stock cooler the rate spire cooler is pretty capable of handling the 2600X at those weighted speeds as you can see with my Ida 64 fbu stress test which is the worst case scenario the CPU got as far as 9 DC under load and 38c during idle if you're building a PC around a specific budget say for example you don't have the money to spend for an aftermarket cooling solution and when you offset that budget to a GPU because currently GP prices let's not talk about that so if you are a little bit limited on that budget you know the stock cooler is actually very capable of running the 2600X at stock settings with the stock speed so you won't have a problem reaching 4.1 gigahertz to 4.1 to 4.2 gigahertz with the stock core just keep in mind don't expect the best overclocking capabilities with the stock cooler just as I did I actually wasn't able to get a good OC with the included stock cooler I had to obviously install an aftermarket cooling solution like the D 15 so you know you can always start with the stock cooler and then later on once you have the money you can upgrade to an aftermarket AIO solution or an air cooler with that being said let's get into the benchmarks starting with Cinebench r15 running the CPU test the 2600X at stock settings with the stock cooler by the way scored a little over 1300 points that's roughly thirty four percent slower than here Ryzen 7 2700X at stock settings makes sense because it's a six core CPU compared to an eight core processor the four point one five gigahertz overclock on the 2600X with the memory speeds again at 3400 Hertz gave us a score of 1416 pretty impressive switching to OpenGL it's a completely different and an odd scenario interestingly enough the 2600X at stock sayings yielded a little over a hundred and twenty frames per second compared to 118 on the 2700X overclocking it to four point one five year heads I gave it a massive boost dishing out over 130 frames per second honestly I don't have an explanation here so feel free to have your thoughts in the comments down below they're running the BMW scene took around 6 minutes to complete on the 2600X compared to 4 minutes and 26 seconds on the 2700X this was expected because the lower core count on the 2600X is a bit of a hindrance especially when it comes to CPU based 3d rendering if you are looking for a faster solution in that department I'd highly recommend picking out the Ryzen 7 2700X thanks to the addition of two extra cores overclocking the 2600X to four point one five gigahertz shaved a little bit of time but not by that much same story goes for a 3d max Corona the 2600X takes an extra 40 seconds to render the scene compared to the 2700X the 4.1 5 gigahertz OC shaves like 9 seconds compared to the stock so it's not that significant Paul Ray didn't really show that much of a difference between the 2600X and the 2700X and this is likely due to the lighter render load with the benchmark but when you run more complex scripts the 8 core 2700X would complete those tasks faster moving on to some real-world tests I took a one-minute 4k timeline exported it to the YouTube 4k precent using Adobe Media encoder and as you can see there's roughly a 20 second difference between the 2600X and the 2700X which isn't that significant even the four point one five years OC didn't really make much of a difference but rendering a 12-minute project using the same 4k precent shows the true potential of those two additional course on the 2700X the six core Ryzen 5 2600X took an extra six minutes to render the video and the four point one five gigahertz OC shaved off a few minutes which is pretty nice but I did notice something interesting while playing around with the 4k timeline with an Adobe Premiere Pro so I noticed while playing back 4k videos this is DS RGH five videos played back in full resolution I didn't notice a lot of frame drops with the 2600X when compared to the 2700X so for complex 4k editing I wouldn't recommend the 2600X you're much better off upgrading to be 2700X because you're gonna get a little bit of a better editing experience compared to the Ryzen 5 2600X for 1080p edits I think the 2600X is just absolutely just perfect all right let's move on to some gaming benchmarks and right off the bat you can see that there isn't a significant difference once again between the 2600X and the 2700X take 3dmark times pi and firestrike for example the overall scores are almost neck to neck with each other and you'll see this trend with some games as well depending on optimization now I did run all of my gaming tests at 1080p so let's kick things off with battlefield one set to ultra settings the 2700X dished out a hundred and sixty three frames per second compared to one hundred and fifty three on the 2600X so that's roughly at 10 FPS difference over watch a 1080p set to epoch yielded roughly the same frame rates on both the 2600X and the 2700X doom at 1080p set to ultra using the Vulkan API yields as the same result around 200 films per second on both CPUs which is more than enough to be honest but remember that we're smashing right into the game engines framerate cap lastly we have Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon at 1080p set to very high settings and here once again we notice similar performance on both processors which shouldn't be surprised because coming to think of it a while back we did compare Intel's very old i7 2600k to the 8700K paired it up with a gtx 980 ti and noticed a minimal improvement in most titles at 1080p and 1440p if you're interested in checking out that video I'll link it right over here so there are a few things to take away from this video AMD's Ryzen 5 2600X is by far the best value focused creativity slash gaming CPU because at 230 dollars you're getting six core processor with 12 threads comes with a stock cooler by the way which is incredible because you know you don't have to fetch around for aftermarket cooling solution and if you're on a tight budget this is an excellent bundle and when it comes to performance I think you're really going to notice a difference between the 2600X and the 2700X in multi-core workloads for example if you are working with you know 3d rendering that's heavily based on CPU workloads then the 2700X is your best bet because those two additional course can come in really beneficial and we've seen a similar trend with Adobe Media encoder and you know the 4k exports you're definitely going to notice a huge improvement when you upgrade to the 8 core processor but needless to say the 6 core processor the 2600X is actually pretty capable of editing a 4k and just 1080p videos in general and that's something that impressed me a lot with this processor now when it comes to overclocking here's a thing I don't think you're going to notice a significant improvement when you decide to overclock the CPU and remember you need an aftermarket cooling solution to get a proper stable OC in my case 4.15 yards was too stable overclocked I was able to get but honestly I didn't notice a significant increase in Europe you know productivity and just gaming performance in general when you overclock this processor you're actually much better off letting the CPU at stock settings because you know from my tests I noticed that you know idle situations and if you throw in an aftermarket cooling solution this processor can easily run at 4 gigahertz and plus doing those scenarios which is impressive because it's a lot better than what first generation Ryzen processors did offer so that's something to keep in mind lastly I wanted to talk about pairing this up with an appropriate motherboard because during my test I did use the CPU on an extraordinary motherboard but if you are on a tight budget pairing this up with a b250 motherboard makes a lot more sense I'll be it make sure that that board comes with the appropriate up-to-date BIOS to support these second generation Rison processors and I'm not exactly sure if you're going to be losing performance from x470 to b250 on the 2600X or even the rest of Ryzen CPU's that's something that I have to investigate later on perhaps I'll create a build video featuring the featuring a b350 motherboard and you know one of these processors I should also mention that some online retailers are offering bundles so for example you can pick up the 2600X with an X470 motherboard and save a few extra dollars on that part but one of the things about this platform is that you can always upgrade down the line so you can pick up a 2600K today and when you have the budget later on you can upgrade to be Ryzen 7 2700X and get an extra multi-core performance which is incredible so that about wraps up this comparison between the Ryzen 5 2600X and the Ryzen 7 2700X what do you guys think about this comparison do you think the 2600X held up pretty well with the 2700X and multi-core applications through the test let me know in the comments down below also do you see yourself picking out be 2600X over the 2700X and what do you guys think about the overclocking performance are you impressed or are you not that impressed let me know in the comments down below I'm Eber with Hardware Canucks thank you so much for watching and we'll see you in the next one",

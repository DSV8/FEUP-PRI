    "description": "You can support this channel on Patreon!  Link below   Sometimes, a company in Japan decides they're gonna give it all they got, and the result is a wacky machine like this.  Pioneer, the company that brought you pretty much everything to do with Laserdisc, designed this wonderful series of machines which are both single side Laserdisc players and 5 disc CD changers.  Due to the limitations of the Laserdisc format, a rather robotic solution was needed to do the job.

    "transcript": "These two machines both have the same primary mission. Their mission, should they choose to accept it, is to play five compact discs in a row uninterrupted. On the left, we have a Sony CDP-C235, which accomplishes its mission in a completely ordinary and mundane fashion. On the right is a Pioneer CLD-M301. And it has a little robot inside to help it along. The Sony machine uses a boring ol carousel to do its work. When you press eject, after making a startling amount of creaking noises, the drawer opens with a single CD front and center. Pressing Disc Skip spins the circular inner portion 72 degrees to present you with the next disc. Each depression for a disc is handily marked in stylish print. (Just in case the vacuum fluorescent display wasnt enough.) Pressing eject on the Pioneer machine presents you with this monstrous and confusing tray, littered with tiny little markings, details, and indentations. At least you can see all the discs at once, I guess. But wait. Theres a 6th spot in the middle. And whats with all the little felt pads everywhere? Also, this is just one solid piece of plastic. Hows the machine supposed to select a disc if it cant move? Ah, well that explains the robot. The machine from Pioneer isnt just a CD player. Its also a Laserdisc player. Now if you dont know what Laserdiscs are, you must be pretty new here, as Ive made an entire exhaustive series on the format which should be appearing in the corner pretty soon. Ill warn you, its a long series. In two sentences Laserdiscs were the first consumer optical disc, released in test markets at the tail of 1978 and therefore beating the CD by nearly 4 years. These 12 inch-- a little late there, are we?-- These 12 inch discs contain up to an hour of near-DVD quality analog video per side, and although they stuck around until the first year of the new millenium, their market penetration in North America was an abysmal 2% at its peak which probably explains why you havent heard of them before, if you havent. OK that last sentence was a bit of a runon. The Compact Disc, released in 1982, was a near-immediate success (unlike Laserdisc). By 1984, Pioneer was making Laserdisc players that could also play CDs. They wanted in on that action, and some executive (probably) wisely thought, why not make a twofer, and maybe spur along the sales of Laserdisc. Sadly it didnt really help the sales of Laserdisc, but by the early nineties, the Compact Disc was all the rage. How lame you were if you didnt have a CD player by the time Home Improvement hit the airwaves. Not long into the first years of being on the market, the CD changer was developed to allow for playing multiple discs at once. I couldnt find any info on exactly when the first CD changers were released, but I can tell you that 1991 seems to have been a pretty important year as this was the first year Pioneer made a machine like this. Not wanting to miss out on the new wave of CD changers, Pioneer decided, by golly, we can squeeze that into a Laserdisc player! And they did! And this is the result. Now, Pioneer faced a bit of an odd problem when designing a combo CD changer and Laserdisc player. See in CD changers like this Sony, the actual CD reader is shoved in a corner inside the machine. The CDs themselves are brought to it when the carousel turns. But that cant be done in this machine because it also needs to be able to play a Laserdisc. For this machine, the actual disc transport has to be in the center. So Pioneer, the manufacturer brave enough to design a little ferris wheel to lift the laser to the top side of a Laserdisc to allow for laying both sides of a single disc, decided to just use a robotic arm to pick up the disc and bring it to the center. Why not? Take a look at this in action. This spot here is disc 1. Watch what it does. (various mechanical sounds) OK, thats pretty impressive. Now lets select disc 5 over here. (more various mechanical sounds) I love how this machine works, but its hard to get a good view of what exactly its doing. Nothing a screwdriver cant fix! At first glance, this may not look like much. This black plastic circle functions as the upper clamp. In many optical disc drives, the spindle motor works with a piece like this to actually clamp the disc down as it spins. Together, they essentially form an optical disc sandwich. Usually these clamps are pretty loose and spin freely, and sure enough so does this one. But youd be wrong to think this is any ordinary optical drive disc clamp. This is in fact how the player picks up the CDs. If I start turning this drive belt by hand, youll see that the clamp moves towards the end of the arm where it would be positioned above a CD. But once it stops, if I keep turning eventually these three little fingers will pop out here. These hold on to a CD through the center hole. Holding a CD from the center meant that even the 80mm mini cd was compatible. Rather ingeniously, the fingers lock in place once the motor reaches its end stop. When the motor is reversed, the disc clamp returns to the center, bringing the disc along with it. Only when its back to the center and the motor keeps spinning further do the fingers retract into the clamp and let the disc go. At this point it can play the disc. When its time to put the disc back, the player will first reverse the motor even farther, which re-engages and locks the fingers. Then it spins forward and travels to the end, with the fingers locked in place the whole time. This time, running the motor beyond its end stop disengages the fingers, which lets go of the disc, and then reversing the motor brings it back to the center. Im glad I took this apart because it revealed a very elegant simplicity to this mechanism. Notice how the drive gear engages with this track. At each end, the track is fragmented. These sections here can actually move when this pin is released, and are pulled by the same motor which moves the grabby clamper. These plastic hook things are what actually engage and disengage the fingers that hold the disc, and theyre attached to these small moveable sections of track. When the clamp reaches the end of its travel, it hits the lock pin which frees the small track section and allows it to move. But ingeniously, by this point the drive gear is already off the stationary track segment, meaning the gear is only engaged with the moveable piece. With the small section of track now free to move, the motor works to pull it towards the clamp, which pulls the hook thing along with it. This pushes or pulls on small tabs above the clamp, and these extend or retract the disc grabbing fingers. When the motor reverses direction, it first pushes the track back to its normal position where it locks in place, and after the track has stopped moving and locked in, the gear can now move the disc clamp along the track. Arranging the track like this allowed for a single motor to move the clamp and engage the fingers. This is really genius engineering in my humble opinion. It echoes the both side play mechanism from the CLD-D502--the same motor which moves the laser along the rails sends it to the top, too. You can see the tracking gear spinning as it reaches the top. At the end of its travel, it engages with the linear teeth here to move the laser towards the center of the disc. By the way, Im pretty sure these could be considered rack and pinion systems, with this the rack and that the pinion. As cool as this machine is, it suffers from being both a sub-par Laserdisc player as well as a sub-par CD changer. Lets put the Disc Grabber 9000 back in place and compare operation of these two machines. When compared to a carousel CD changer, the Pioneer machine is significantly slower to change discs. Lets do a race. Well switch from disc one to disc 2 on both machines. (even more various mechanical noises) Yeah that wasnt even close. Also, the Sony machine has the advantage of being able to spin the carousel backwards. If you want to go from disc 1 to disc 5, the Sony machine will simply rotate counterclockwise and get straight to disc 5. The Pioneer has to travel all the way around to do the same thing. The farthest the Sony machine ever has to travel is 2 spaces away, whereas the Pioneer will always have to travel the relative distance between discs. However you could argue that the Pioneer machine is more convenient to load up, so long as the convoluted tray isnt a bother, as you have access to all 5 discs at once. Oh, but the Sony does have a neat party trick courtesy of its disc tray. You might have noticed that the access cutouts for the laser transport are slanted. This is to allow for the disc ex-change system. The Sony will allow you to swap out the other 4 discs while its playing the fifth. The recess for whichever disc is in the back left corner has its cutout go straight back and lines up with the reader mechanism, allowing room for the laser carriage to travel beneath it. This means that the disc tray can move outward while it holds on to the disc its playing. The machine is even smart enough to present the discs two at a time, so that you never even see the spot for the disc its currently playing. Though often times it has to do a bit of a shuffle to reassure itself what position its actually in before it closes the tray. Aside from this feature, the Sony is just overall better at being a CD changer. Its faster, the display is far more comprehensive and there are many more controls on the machine itself. Perhaps most importantly, it's a heck of a lot quieter. Pioneer again used clever cost saving and simple engineering, and the machine uses the same motor that drives the disc tray for lifting and lowering the disc grabber thing. Again I admire the simplicity, but that motor is loud! And because of the way it operates, it makes a plethora of distinct noises and in general is just bizarre sounding. (A plethora of distinct, bizarre sounding noises) By the way, the Sony machine isnt a goodwill find, it was the CD player I grew up with. Its always made that creaking sound. (pronounced creaking sound as the disc is lowered) But its still far less intrusive than all this nonsense. (yet still more various, bizarre, distinct mechanical noises) So then, how does it do as a Laserdisc player? Well, its not bad. Theres nothing inherently wrong with its performance, although there are plenty of players with better video performance. And they combined the CD changing aspect into it rather well. Pioneer actually marketed the fact that you can leave your favorite CDs in place when you want to play a Laserdisc. Also perhaps less known is that you can place a 6th CD in the center which it will play, but it does prevent using the changer. But this means you can leave your 5 favorites in place, and play a 6th disc individually. I can actually see the appeal for that. But what the CD changer makes impossible is a both-side play mechanism. There simply is no way to fit the top rails for the laser and this robot thing in the same case without extensive modification of both systems. You can see that the construction of these machines is very similar, with the one on the right having a both side play mechanism rather than a disc changer. I think the only way to combine these two systems together would be to stack them and design a claw-machine like apparatus to grab a CD through this space. Even if they pulled it off, the machine would likely be hideously expensive and comically tall. So, to buy this machine means getting a less-than-ideal Laserdisc player and a less-than-ideal CD changer. Now, I understand that there were plenty of single side machines being sold that didnt even have a CD changer inside. Both Side Play was really a high-end item. But then you have to ask, is its clunky CD changer worth it? To that, Id say yeah... This was a pretty clever move by Pioneer. They seem to have priced this model just a hundred dollars higher than a basic Laserdisc player. Abes of Maine apparently wanted just seventy bucks more for it over a CLD-S201, a basic Laserdisc player. That made it significantly cheaper than buying two devices. But, and this is a BIG but, it was still more than double the price of a basic CD changer. In fact, its more expensive than ANY of these CD changers, including the Sony CDP-C910 which accommodates 10 CDs in a cartridge magazine. I think Pioneers intent with these machines was to try and ride the wave of the CD changer and spur sales of Laserdiscs at the same time. Laserdisc did receive a bit of a boom in the late 80s and early 90s as the home theater scene came into light. If someone was looking for a CD changer, why not take a look at a machine that can play Laserdiscs, too? But Im sure it was still a hard sell. And not just because of the price. Unless you had already integrated your TV into your home stereo, having a CD player hooked into your TV isnt exactly ideal. I suppose its nice, but it wont sound great. That said, this player does produce a neat graphic on screen when changing discs. Yipee. Oh, and one last unsettling thing. Laserdisc are heavy and spin at very high speeds--up to 30 revolutions per second, or 1,800 RPM. I am not a fan of how close the disc changing mechanism is to the discs surface. That sharp metal thing is awfully close to that scratchable disc. In fact, this machine has the tightest clearances Ive ever seen in a Laserdisc player. With a Laserdisc playing above a tray full of CDs, its not even a centimeter above them. Thats a tad scary. Thanks for watching, I hope you enjoyed this video.

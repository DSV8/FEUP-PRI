    "transcript": "- Tech news is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get but it's usually something to do with tech. So you kinda do know, checkmate. Intel may finally stop torturing us and release their freaking ARC GPU soon. And some new leaks might indicate what kind of performance we can expect. A recent Intel slide spotted on Twitter indicates a top end SKU with 512 execution units and 16 gigabytes of VRAM on a 512 gigabyte per second bus. So this is going to be something fairly high performance, probably akin to something like the 3070 Ti from NVIDIA. (chuckles) I mean there's, there's a 3090, you know, like Intel come on, get it together, how are you gonna make any money launching GPU's for poors. - [Riley] Ya, look at NVIDIA. - Going down the stack, we see models with 384 and 256 execution units with 12 and eight gigabytes of VRAM respectively, AMD, which would probably compete with the RTX 3060 and 3050. Keep in mind that these are laptop GPU's we're talking about, AMD, but there will also be desktop cards on the way deep breaths, - [Riley] Ya. - happy thoughts. - [Riley] Great card Anthony, it's gonna be okay, is AMD in the room right now? - I don't know. (Riley laughs) Major cryptocurrencies took an absolute beating over the weekend and into today with Bitcoin now hovering around 36,000 US dollars was at its lowest point since July and Ethereum was down to $2,400 about half of its value from back in early November. But what are you gonna do? Cry about it? (chuckles) I thought apes together strong. (Riley laughs) You know, it's not just one factor pushing crypto prices down either. Investors are reportedly worried about the US federal reserve implementing measures to reduce inflation. They're worried about that? Holy crap! What? (Anthony laughs) - [Riley] They'll make lots of money. - They're also worried about a rather steep downturn in tech stocks, and the Russian government looking at banning crypto entirely which is a significant development since Russia is currently a global leader in crypto mining and nostalgia for post-world war one totalitarian regimes, you know, good old days. - [Riley] Oh man. (Anthony singing in foreign language) - [Riley] Wait, what? - Is the gigabit connection at your home or office, just too pedestrian for you? (Riley chuckles) If so, AT&T has something to sell you, as usual. As the telecom giant is rolling out both two and five gigabit fiber options. Is this for the metaverse? - [Riley] Ya, I think it's for metaverse. - It's for the metaverse, I hate that word. (Riley screams) - Stop calling it that, it's second life 2.0, second, second life. The company says the new services will be available in over 70 US metropolitan areas but unsurprisingly the faster speeds will cost you. Home consumers will be selling at a 110 bucks a month for two gigs and 180 a month per five. How? - [Riley] What? - I'm spending so much more than that right now for 750. - [Riley] We're in Canada. We're in Canada. - No, no but I'm not paying $150 for 750 right now. - [Riley] Oh. So anyway, that's cool, thanks AT&T. Still it could be worth it, if you do content creation or other kinds of data heavy work especially with so many people now working from home in the wake of the pandemic. Is that expensive? Probably. I mean, I have no context because Canada sucks and Telus apparently sucks a lot more than I thought they did. - [Riley] Oh man. I didn't know this is gonna get personal. - Ya, it's real personal. Now it's time for the quick bits brought to you by my special friends at Seasonic. They worked really hard on the prime TX 1000 watt power supply, okay? Have you ever built one of those? Of course you haven't because you haven't been making power supplies for more than 40 years. Do you even know how to certify a power supply with an 80 plus titanium efficiency rating or to make it fully modular with fluid dynamic bearings or to give it a 12 year warranty? That's what I thought. So get over to Seasonic.com click the links below because they already did that stuff. And I love them. (Riley chuckles) Quick bits, at this time of day? Oh Reginald, you are daring. (Riley laughs) Rumors are swirling that Apple is hiring Xbox engineers away from Microsoft, as part of its efforts, to get its own console to market again which would be pretty surprising considering, well, I mean, it's Apple. But also not surprising given how annoying they've made it for Microsoft, NVIDIA and Google to launch their game streaming apps on iOS. Honestly, an Apple console could do well by just marketing themselves as a Nintendo that actually cares about user experience. Ooh. - [Riley] Aye! - Ya, they got that online infrastructure kinda nailed down at Apple not so much at Nintendo. According to this day. - [Riley] Voice chat, what is it? - What is voice chat? You can just use your phone for voice chat. That's what I used to do. The RTX 3050 is coming out this week and we now have a better idea as to what its performance will look like. It'll be comparable to a GTX 1660 ti. So, definitely not bad for an entry-level card especially considering you can do ray tracing and DLSS. And even better? It apparently sucks at mining cryptocurrency. - [Man] Yeah! - Not that anybody cares 'cause the price is dropping. Got 'em. And if the fact that we're cheering about that hasn't changed your mind about the whole crypto thing. I don't know what to do for you. Meta book is talking up its new supercomputer built on NVIDIA's DGX platform. It'll run over 16,000 GPUs that's where they're all going. (Riley laughs) Damn it Mark! It'll run over 16,000 GPUs and is expected to be one of the fastest in the world. No not one of, the fastest one in the world when it launches later this year. The AI research supercluster or RSC, they could've probably throw it an I in there, will be used to develop algorithms for systems across Meta's digital kingdom. The mordor of the metaverse, if you will. Want a big name Android smartwatch but not a fan of the options out there currently? Me too. Mark May 26th on your calendar as a new leak from Jon Prosser indicates that that's when Google pixel watch will be dropping. Of course, that date could get moved because one, there are global supply chain issues, two, it's Google and three, watch leaks are notoriously unreliable for some reason. Just get a Seiko. - [Riley] That leaky watcher. - God you would think that they would know if they got a watch right? Oh, there. - [Riley] Is there a watch or not? - The watch is in early access so it's not working properly yet. That's what it is. - [Riley] It's in the metaverse. - It's in the metaverse. And in the bit of news that should surprise absolutely no one. Nintendo wasn't a very big fan of a fan made first person shooter where you run around with a gun and both hunt and defend yourself from wild Pokemon. (Riley laughs) Complete with blood, the game wasn't made available to download but clips were posted on YouTube and quickly taken down due to Nintendo's DMCA claims. No word yet on whether we might be getting a sequel where fish from Magikarp with dynamite. Oh, that would be great. (Riley laughs) No, the dynamite would explode and then just like instantly evolve into Gyarados. - [Riley] Oh, it's true. That's, that'll be actually pretty smart - [Riley] When hunting Rapidash aim for the heart. - Yes. And we're done fishing for news for today. So come back on Wednesday for more tech news. I have no idea what we're going to talk about. Like, I don't know, fashion? - [Riley] lttstore.com? - lttstore.com.",

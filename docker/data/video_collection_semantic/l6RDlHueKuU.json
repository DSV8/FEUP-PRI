    "transcript": "now that is satisfying you got an offer getting no ah hello the people I'm Dimitri and beside me as the long-awaited P600 we initially saw this at Computex and now we have the final production sample in our hands so let's overview big thanks to all of our sponsors for making CES possible now the Eclipse P series is all about performance and silence so the P600s is kind of a combination of the two interior shell is basically based off the Evolv X make sure to check out all of our content that we based on the Evolv X so you know it's a roomy interior you can populate an ITX motherboard above so all the same features in terms of the sliding low pads beside the motherboard tray I'm not a fan of those I just you know simply prefer regular rubber grommets but they have made a bunch of changes on the exterior so the one of the most predominant things right now you see is this matte steel it's not plastic despite looking like plastic you know it's quite cold to the touch in this very cold montreal basement thus why I'm wearing two sweaters I am NOT a fan of this color no math is fine and you know it will not show off as you know as many fingerprints as let's say non matte steel but I was hoping they could go into direction of being a little bit more you know creative like for example if you remove the front little piece over here to reveal your mesh fabric I was hoping that this mesh fabric would be accented colors so like maybe it's like the darker gray or they could go into like a colorful territory but you know in terms of this all black design it is a little bit boring but of course it's really awesome to see this whole mesh movement you know cases in 2017 where these glass close boxes with choked air flow now we're just swinging the other way meshifying everything basically and so it's really good to see mesh on the interior you know below this metallic casing so you can have a quiet system that is going to be hotter or opened it up for better air flow it is very cool to see a new pattern being introduced to the case market you know the whole idea of fabric being interchangeable so I'm hoping that Phanteks plays around with color and actually delivers something a little bit different other than black maybe different colors of course but what happens if you rip it what happens if you accidentally slightly push too hard on it is it gonna lose its you know elasticity is it gonna be droopy later on so a lot of questions arise but I guess we'll have to wait and see this front plate can be angled out so it opens up air flow and the side methylations are facing the back so any noise escape from the front will be channeled towards the rear the IO is hidden behind this cover with dual USB threes a Type C Gen 2 port audio jacks and a reset switch the power button is at the top along with this other removable magnetic plate that reveals another similar to the front mesh dust filter that is awesome to catch and in settling dust and also for aesthetics if you want to open up the front and the top for air flow the temporal glass side panel swivels to open pretty standard stuff it can also be removed from the hinges while the rear panel also supposed to open has noise dampening material applied on it since this is an S edition of the enclosures therefore silence focused and has a little of fabric tabs to help you easily open that rear side panel as for the interior you have three 140 member of fans and all the layout is exactly the same as the Evolv X and you know you don't really get to experience the enclosure unless you build in it so with no fogged in so here's the situation we got the P600s all situated with the system by the way this or is 2080 TI is absolutely insane I actually like this so instead of temperature testing we have got ourselves an enamel anemometer and anemometer that it measures the air speed and so the whole idea is to use an instrument like this to see what the air flow basically is like I think it's gonna be pretty fun we're actually going to see if it's accurate though let's begin the air flow taste so basically this anemometer what we want to do is we want to set up inside the case it's a really quick and dirty setup right now because we're leaving for CES tomorrow morning again it's just gonna be non scientific we're gonna put in there see if there's any differences in the readings from when we put on or off the side panels basically this little fan in here it's gonna spin and it's gonna give us a measurement in meters per second hopefully yeah I'm hoping that we can actually see a visual difference when the sight when the front panel is installed when it's removed when it's on an angle and then when the dust filter is installed and all that goodness I need it make sure that it's straight that's something all right we're all set up I think we should turn it on let's see what happens okay you do it oh it didn't knock over that's good hmm so that's stationary it will spin if you speak into it so putting my hand here will bring us all the way down to 250 feet per minute so basically it seems to be working again unscientific but it seems to be working so all the measurements are in and it's interesting to see the variation of this speed movement we are measuring in feet per minute so with the case in the default configuration we measure 271 but slightly angle in this front panel we measured at 281 so the difference is not significant and removing this whole front panel made no difference which means that whole angular motion is actually pretty good it clears out enough room here but then the interesting thing about removing this section which is you know it's very open it's made of mesh so it's made to move air through I went up to 300 feet per minute so the difference between completely closed and this thing removed was about 30 now removing a dust filter we went up to 313 so dust filter is actually not restrictive at all which is pretty impressive and you can blow through it and can still feel air coming through it which is pretty nice and when you're dealing with high static pressure fans that is all good and so the difference between completely you know default configuration versus unrestricted front intake is about 40 feet per minute so it's not that significant but when you're taking into account completely choked front fans we're reading about 160 so this whole front panel design with the mesh the dust filter and this whole angular front panel motion is pretty decent all those who are contemplating about the Evolv X airflow can now kind of trust that fan fics has no fixed it and the last thing we want to test for a little experimentation is to completely close off that front panel because that is quite common on cases and so completely unrestricted we're getting around 315 feet per minute but now with you know those front fans completely kind of blocked off with a few millimeters away from the front metal piece like what what is that reading I think we're at 161 oh wow it's like nothing it's pretty cool interesting that's for the price it is slightly cheaper than the Evolv X which is good if you were considering thinking of the Evolv X for its interior layout for its ITX accommodation you know vertical GPUs so this is a good option if but actually you're looking for that whole performance aspect / silence focused system alright guys so that is the Eclipse P600s from Phanteks you know it's nice to see them kind of innovating the exterior design but I'm hoping that would also focus a little bit more on the interior and kind of like modify certain things that you know users are you know giving them feedback on they're not super satisfied with and I'm hoping that we'll see something in the future release but let me know your thoughts in the comments below thanks much for watching we'll see you guys in the next video",

Don't lose your Apple AirPods -   The Apple AirPods are a fully wireless set of earbuds designed for the iPhone 7 and others but they will work as a standard set of wireless bluetooth headphones on Android devices and more.

    "transcript": "Yes! I finally got the AirPods I almost said EarPods! Believe it or not, they arrived a little while ago But there was a lot of things going on Moving studios, and then CES, and it's like I haven't looked at them yet You guys got a lot of questions about these things you're like, are they any good? Is our future completely wireless? Are they just EarPods with the cords cut off? I don't know! So that's what we're here for We're going to find out, are the AirPods any good or Do They Suck? Do they suck, does it suck, Whatever! Apple has essentially taken the EarPods but now they made it wireless. It's using a completely new method of pairing to your device it's a whole new look right inside your iPhone when connecting to these now they will also work with Android devices and other Bluetooth devices but you won't have all that fancy pairing going on So here's what the package looks like and you can see on the back there's a little case that comes with it a charging case looks like some some dental floss and that keeps some extra battery in it that charges these things up even when you're away from an outlet as you know there's been some criticism with the latest iPhone ditching the traditional headphone jack but it's pretty obvious that that's a move to push people in the direction of the wireless earphone / headphone space you guys remember Apple also owns Beats Audio ok little bit of paperwork about the AirPods then you have the AirPods themselves like I said I mean it's almost exactly like a dental floss case and then underneath there you're charging cable uses the Lightning connector so probably have an abundance of those already so those will work now a lot of people kind of have a love-hate relationship with their ear pods as it is right now but this is different because now you're buying a peripheral you're spending money extra money on headphones so your expectations are kind of going to be a little bit elevated lightning connector goes in the bottom now this guy in the top flips up there is a little magnet in there your pods pull out like that i mean they're not the most attractive things in the world some people said it looks like a toothbrush sticking out of your ear and earring or something like that let me just see it [Lew Laughs] yeah I mean it's a wierd look they are small and very lightweight so I feel, I feel free it's not the tightest fit in the game I will say that of course Apple here with the AirPod just like the EarPod has a one-size-fits-all there's no tips you put on there, they either fit you great or or they don't know now the other thing to remember is these things also have microphones right because you should be able to trigger certain events by speaking directly to them or by talking and taking phone calls maybe that has something to do with the design as well look the the shape of the thing for me this evaluation right here has more to do with the sound and the fit and and so far these are okay in my ears they're comfortable at least now the real thing is this ability to pair with your iphone in a far simpler fashion than a pair of generic Bluetooth earbuds oh wow ok cool in my opinion that's why you're buying these things or your are not buying these things is for that right there smooth as butter look at this open it up as you if you want to connect speed that's the killer wrath look at that I just press connect and that's it the battery life of the air pods themselves and also the remaining battery on the case now these babies go in and now it's time for the musical evaluation the real question here for me are all these things an upgrade over the regular earpods or are they just a wireless version of it [Lew Jamming to his Jam] ok listen I like a lot of volume with my headphones one of the things that I've been noticing about fully wireless headphones whether they're Bluetooth or these ones I'm not getting a ton of volume now it's probably better for my hearing in the long run but I like a I like a thump to it you know, what if you are on Android then what does the process look like this button on the back yeah ok cool that button now I see AirPods pots I mean that's pretty easy as well let's try this out sound is is essentially identical even on Android I'd say it's just it's a little bit easier than some of the competitors in the fully wireless space because some of those are like turn on one earbud and then wait 14 seconds look at the moon and howl and then the other one comes on, like you know it's against a bit of a truthfully I'm a little surprised Apple made them compatible you know the way they are with the proprietary stuff you get the added functionality with their phone but hey Android people you can use them you probably won't but you can let's give these a shot now I wonder if i plug these in if it's just gonna immediately switch over to them now the first thing I'm noticing is the fit is actually not identical this one does have a little bit more depth to it less isolation with these than those right off the bat let's see if this just switches over instantly when I play this it does ok let me just switch back real quick the sound attributes are very similar and i think i actually got a little bit more volume out of these so I think these are a purchase of convenience right to have a nice little pack that goes with it and to not have the potential pairing woes associated with a wireless pair of headphones the convenience is actually a big huge component here and then you mix in the fact that you're not tied down strictly to iOS like you could use these with Android if you really wanted to from a sound perspective it's hard to get fired up you know what I mean like I've listened to very expensive headphones, earphones, earbuds you name it and you could tell from my reaction normally when it comes to reactions you can't fake it like you saw me, I mean I wasn't I wasn't jumping out of my chair they sound essentially like the things that were already included with your iPhone except without a cable is that cool is that good or does that suck It's hard for me to say it sucks and i'll tell you why listen up real quick progress getting to the next level pushing people towards whatever that next thing is it's always a little bit painful there's always drawbacks along the way but somebody has to step in and do it and a lot of people out there are gonna be saying but wait Apple wasn't the first person with fully wireless earbuds but it's true they think they weren't and very rarely are they the first but the difference is when it gets adopted by Apple more people get into the game more people use it they have crazy distribution crazy branding and so people put these things in their pocket and it pushes other manufacturers who might make something more that I would like and you would like to adopt those technologies because the marketplace expands rapidly when Apple does something wether you like Apple or not their influence is vast in the game I can say the sound I'm not happy with the sound the convenience is an A+ though if you're in the game for sound I'll show you 300 pairs of headphones you can stick a nap on it and zone out you can hit the next dimension that's what I'm about Jack that's a different story",

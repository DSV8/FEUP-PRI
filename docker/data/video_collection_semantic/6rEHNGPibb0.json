Come with me and Jared Mecham as we test out the new PancakeBot 2.0 from Amazon. I knew the moment I saw it that I needed to own one. And I was pleasantly surprised with the ease of pancake printing. It took a few tries to get the hang of the breakfast printer, but in the end, we were victorious.   I also show how to assemble the pancake bot during this tech review.   Check out Jareds channel here:   Would you buy a printer like this for your breakfast?! How would you feel about robot pancakes?

    "transcript": "[Robotic movements] [Plop] Whoa!!! So weve all heard of 3D printers and being able to prototype and make stuff out of plastic, you know, a machine just printing it out for us. But what about food? The future is here! There is a 3D pancake printer that literally 3D prints your food. And I have my buddy Jared here and were going to build this together. [Intro] Alright, so this is everything inside of the box. Im not exactly sure what everything does yet. This is the griddle where the pancakes actually go on. [Jared] Im really surprised on how few pieces there are. I mean, this cant be that difficult, right? [Zack] I know. I sure hope its not that difficult. [Jared] Knock on wood. [Zack] And then this should rest right on top of this other side here, right? Okay so right now we have the gantry in place. Im going to slide this down to the end, which is actually pretty interesting because its got this little rubber belt drive right here and thats whats going to control it. So if youve ever seen a 3D printer, its got its different axes. So right here, this belt is going to bring it back and forth and then this belt right here is going to control the actual pancake mix itself and go left and right. That way, through the computations of this system, it can get pancake mix wherever we want it with whatever artwork were going to be printing at the time. So Im going to go ahead and slide this all the way back. Im going to put this over here in the corner, and then Im going to set the griddle into place. [Jared] So obviously this is where your pancake mix is going to go. And you see that there are a few different slots right here. Thats going to identify your printing mode and your standby mode. So we want to make sure we have that in the right position, and then that just drops in. And then you can change your different modes here. And then this is your air tube, and that just plugs in right there at the top. And then it will print out the bottom. [Zack] Whats nice about the PancakeBot is that it does come with an SD card and an SD card slot, so its a little more high tech than the newest MacBook from Apple. So I think were done right? Its built. [Jared] Yep, its all the way done. Five pieces went together really quick. Im really impressed with that. [Zack] That was a lot easier than I thought. So now we need some pancake mix right? [Jared] And then well get some designs and well print something. [Zack] Okay, lets try it. [Music] [Zack] So were going to do the T-Rex first. Did you pull the T-Rex? [Jared] Yeah. [Zack] Alright. It says its working. Somethings moving. Okay, were in a bad spot! [Jared] Ha ha! There we go! [Zack] Was it going to start printing the T-Rex on the edge? What is going on? Alright, that doesnt..Oh! Freaking need this! The air compressor hose! [Jared] Oh no! Ha ha! [Zack] Its moving! Quick! Get it on there! Alright, is it working now? We are terrible pancake printers. [Jared] The air pressure definitely makes a difference though, doesnt it? [Zack] Yeah, it is coming out more. [Jared] If this were on it probably wouldnt have leaked, right? [Zack] Yeah, because of the suction. The suction would have kept it in. Thats a legright? [Jared] I think so. Or is it the tail? Ha ha! [Zack] I dont think our first print is a success. [Jared] No, but thats on us. Thats not the printer. [Zack] I think it is a leg. Look, this was supposed to be a leg. If we had this set up rightlook this is the mouth right here. Here, Im going to turn this down because we might be burning it. So thats good to know, if it starts to burn too fast then you can just turn down the heat. Like for the bigger designs that take longer to print. So that will be good. And now its filling in. Oh hey, we can dial in the air pressure. So it looks like were on low pressure right now. I wonder if we dial this up to a 4. Now its actually like pouring it in. [Jared] Oh yeah, there we go. [Zack] Alright. So theres definitely some dialing in that you have to do to get the art just right. You can increase the air pressure. You can turn up and down the heat so it cooks slower. So yeah, when the air pressure was low it was barely filling in, but now that weve turned up the air pressure, it filled in solid. [Jared] We just gave our dinosaur stripes is all we were really doing. [Zack] I see the potential though. I see the potential in this thing. Look at that tail! Dude weve got a tail! [Jared] Um, Im going to let you try and flip this one. [Zack] Ha ha! Okay hand me a spatula. It almost looks like a dinosaur skeleton because we didnt have the pressure turned up all the way. [Jared] Well and thats what we were going for. [Zack] Yeah, a skeleton. [Jared] Yeah exactly. [Zack] So we have one dinosaur right here, slightly dilapidated. Were going to see if we can make him a friend now that we kind of know how the system works. So were going to jump in here to theso last time we did a T-Rex. I downloaded the triceratops file so lets try that one. Hitting play, now its working. And were not drizzling out this time so thats good. We got the air hose in place. [Music] [Zack] Alright so this is our second attempt. We have our dinosaur buddy, Mr. Dead T-Rex over there, and it looks like, you know, I havent flipped it yet so its still in one piece. But one thing I would change is that every time this goes back to rest in the corner, it drizzles out a little bit from the nozzle. So if PancakeBot is watching this, I would put some kind of spill catch on this very end thing because as soon as the machine turns off its going to start dripping out of that nozzle. Ready? [Jared] Im ready. Whoa! Oh wow, thats not that bad! [Zack] Dang that actually looks pretty cool! [Jared] Yeah it does! [Zack] So it looks like we had a little bit of spillage right here. Oops, ripped his tail off. [Jared] We were thinking that we had to turn down heat for the horns because they were starting to curl a little bit. But it looks like we need a little more heat for the coloring. [Zack] Yeah. So now we are going on our third dinosaur. Were going to reprint the t-rex and see if we can get it a little better than skeletal over here. [Jared] Weve got to redeem him. You know?! [Zack] Alright. I think we finally figured out the magic recipe for this. We have the consistency of the pancake batter to that about of eggnog. [Jared] Maybe like a warm Inn and Out milkshake. I think thats a pretty good example too. [Zack] But its working. Its filling in pretty well. The only problem is when we have the heat too high, like it starts to cook and curl up a little on the edgesso with the tail sometimes with the feet. Right now I have it turned on low. You can also see over here the horns are starting to lift up a little bit too. [Jared] Whoa!!! Look at that! [Zack] That actually looks sweet! Look, its got the eyes on there and everything! [Jared] Thats awesome! Woo! [Zack] Thats insane! [Jared] It only took four hours, ha ha! [Zack] How many tries are in the bone yard? Weve got at least 6 different dinosaurs buried in here. Like sometimes it was too thick. Yeah, that was terrible. But we finally won! [Jared] Look at that! [Zack] Its the consistency of eggnog. Thats what it is. We did a level 4, eggnog batter, and then it was like a low heat so it wouldnt curl up on the edges. Victorious. [Jared] So we finally got the design down. We finally got the settings where we want it to be. But this is someone elses design, so lets go ahead and try to make one of our own and see how that goes. [Zack] You can go to a website and get all kinds of different drawings and stuff. Like here we have a dog, here we have a stegosaurus, a teddy, and Easter bunny. This is also where we got, you know, the Tyrannosaurus Rex that weve been doing. So you can download any one of these, or go to the PancakeBot program itself and you can draw whatever you want right there and it will print that in pancake mix. Or we can import a picture by clicking here, drop the logo in and then you can just kind of like trace around it wherever you want and color in. This logo has some pretty thin lines but hopefully it prints out pretty well. I mean Ive drawn in most of the area. Like Im missing a few gaps. I wish there were more tools with this drawing program. Its called the Pancake Printer. But you got to work with what you have. You can do straight lines pretty well, but I wish there were more like circle tools and stuff. Anyway file and export for printing. And then I will save it to the SD card as EJ, and its exporting. So I saved it as EJ. So were going to go to EJ and then well hit play. And now its going to make our design. [Jared] Im anxious to see how it follows the pattern. You know, like if it knows its a circle or if its just going to like scribble it in everywhere. [Zack] Well see how it turns out. [Jared] I mean this is already good. [Zack] Yeah, it looks like its working out pretty well. Remember its printing it backwards because its going off of when we flip it. So the J is on the left and the E is on the right this time. Its getting that outer layer in. Yay! [Jared] Nailed it! Ha ha! [Zack] So maybe its not good for like super fine drawings, but for like kids artwork or for just normal artwork in general, I think it looks pretty cool. [Jared] I do too. [Zack] As far as 3D pancake printing, I think the future is definitely here. It was definitely fun to attempt for the first time. [Jared] Once you get everything dialed in, you get like a good understanding of where your mix is, where your temperature is, and where the pressure is, I think that youll be able to have a lot of fun with it and youll be able to create some pretty cool things. [Zack] Huge thanks to Jared for letting us use his kitchen. Ill put a link for his channel here. He does a lot of family vlogs with his family. And Ill also include a link for this PancakeBot in the description of this video as well. So take a look at that. Its on Amazon, and its relatively well priced. [Jared] For the ease of assembly and what you can do with it, I defiantly agree. [Zack] It was a fun project. Thanks for watching. Ill see you around. [Jared] Is my hair okay? [Zack] Yeah, your hair looks better than mine at the moment. [Jared] Ha ha!",

    "transcript": "(gasps) - Okay guys I don't know what's in here, exactly, but Maingear has promised me that it is something very special. This is a Maingear Turbo and I don't know the specs, but I can take some wild guesses, I'm going to say 5950X 16 core. I'm going to say 64 gigs of Ram, clocked at some speed, 3,200 or 3,600, that's kinda sensible speeds. I'm going to say RTX 3090. They go 3090? They're going to 3090? Have I got it all right so far? - Pretty much yeah. - Pretty much. Okay, (gasps) (upbeat music) Now I knew it was gonna be high end. What I didn't know was why they asked me to bring my gold X-Box controller to work today for this shoot, because Maingear has apparently built me, this is for me, right? A gold, a golden computer. Oh, my word. The inside is gold too. I need gloves. We will get to this, first, this is important stuff. Okay. I'm going to keep it safe. The cables, manuals, not automatics. (giggles) Got the RGB remote, surprise it's not controlled through software, but I can also see why they might do that. You don't want them background tasks running. Got a USB. How premium is that? 32 gig USB to store your windows recovery on. Okay, all right, we're ready. Let's open this up. Is it just me? Or is it heavier? Is this, no, no, it can't be actually made of gold. This has to be just plated. It's gotta be plated. Okay now, let's do the peel first. What a fantastic finish they got on it. Like check this out, David. Is that a golden mirror or is that a golden mirror? That's a good answer. I mean, you only had one option really. Hi. (David giggles) They even did the bottom, the mad lads. Now, to be clear, this is not a new idea. Voodoo PC, way back in the day, I'm talking like this must have been early 2000s or something like that. Voodoo PC used to have a gold plated tower, gold plated version of their tower. We've got a dual 140 millimeter radiator here on the top. Yeah. Main gear wanted our other turbo back, and I basically just kept it. And so Jonno was asking if they're getting this one back and the answer is now they can have their old one back. You could make the argument that a gold finish on everything is tacky. But I ask you ladies and gentlemen, oh, is it not a beautiful kind of tech? (giggles) Even the holt down for the CPU block is gold-plated. I don't even know how to show that to you. It's buried so deep in the system. Disassemble it? (people laughing) This is art, I mean I would tear apart almost any system, but not this one. Well look, where else are you going to store your 10 terabytes of Call of Duty, okay. On SSDs. I mean, that's fair. Okay. There is a screw rolling around in here, We're panning for nuggets. Here's a screw in a standoff. Here's the standoff. (people exclaiming) There are definitely some areas where they didn't polish that you can't see. So the bottom layer. If you're planning to order one of these, you should know about this, okay. I'm just out there looking after what consumers need to know. Okay. (laughing) How'd they manage to power this thing with a Corsair SF750 watt. Uh huh, okay. Custom plated 3090 GPU block, custom gold-plated... 13,000 US dollars. You know what? That's not actually as crazy as I was expecting. All right. Let's golden game. Oh, sure. I can do a sponsor thing. Thanks to DBrand for sponsoring this video. They make tons of stuff to customize your devices like skins and cases for Apple's new air tags and to celebrate. Colton and Jonno have hidden four air tags around the set. And I need to find them without using an iPhone in order for dbrand to pay us for the sponsorship. I'm sorry. Did you guys agree to this? What do I pay you people for? Okay, fine. I'll find your stupid air tags. Well, there's one. Is that an easy one or a hard one? Okay. Ow! Ow! (people laughing) Oh, I can feel it. (laughing) All right under the carpet. All right, those weren't that hard. Yeah, it got a little, got a little, a cute little D brand things. Do they actually sell this skin? Guys if they don't sell this skin, you got to make sure that you demand it. Send their customer service a request for this skin right here for your air tags. Okay? They love getting lots of spam (beep) questions to their customer service. That's DBrand's favorite. Check them out at the link down below. We ready? - Yep. - Oh, ho, ho, it looks sick. Right? - I'm sure non-geek people are watching the screen like \"What? It's a gold computer.\" Kind of like how I would watch a car video and be like, that's like, it's an engine. Okay car people, this, it's like having a really cool engine. Okay. You know what I'm going to stop pretending that I've only been using this controller with gloves. I've been, I've been raw dogging it. If someone wants to buy it, by the way it is for sale, straight up guys. Put it on LTT store. All right, there we go. I got this. I got this, this is like the first level, it's not exactly hard. Oh! Oh, I have lost connection, I have lost connection. Come on, come on. Is it back? Come on. No, I died. Golden gaming set up. I mean, I shot, how many times you got to shoot someone in the... what are they even doing? Do you see them moving around here? The AI is fairly dumb though. Oh oh, bad timing, bad timing, gold controller. Well, I think we're done here. The top of this is like hot to the touch. Two 140 millimeter rads is not enough. It might be enough for the parts to run within spec, but it is not enough to have this thing not be like fricking hot. I don't know if I've ever felt quite like that before. Thanks for watching guys. Check out main gear, I promise they make systems that are ever so slightly more sensible than this one, but this is definitely super cool. And I really enjoyed playing around with it. This is their turbo gold edition. And it's something. (beep) you DBrand.",

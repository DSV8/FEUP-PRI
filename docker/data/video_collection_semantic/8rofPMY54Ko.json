    "transcript": "After a recent video buying out a small tech shop, many of you asked us, what exactly was the plan? I haven't actually seen everything in one place Yet... Oh my God. The truth is, we don't know. Is it the two tables? There's so much more than I thought. Kind of seemed like a good idea at the time. And hey, if it gave a small business owner a fresh start, so much the better. But as good as all of that felt, we're still stuck with this giant pile of e-crap and I'll be damned if I'm not gonna get some more videos out of it. So it's time to improvise. Here's the plan. You, me and a two hour time limit. Who can build the best complete gaming setup to play Crysis? Okay, but there's a catch. We can only pick one component at a time. No full bare bones systems, which means if you wanna go for the best CPU, you might be giving up the best GPU. Ready, go! FlexiSpot, their C7 premium ergonomic chair supports your lower back, whether you're leaning forward, back, or all the way back. You guys know what I'm talking about. Stay around till the end of this video to learn more. Adding to the challenge, Jordan and I have to decide ahead of time what order we're going to choose our components in. And I gotta say, these are some tough choices. First pick. Audio. Audio. I want those speakers. Woo! How do you favor these speakers, Linus? That's not the point. The point is, I am gonna have 5.1 THX surround. Definitely the best way to enjoy Crysis. I really hope we actually did get all the speakers. I don't see one of them. You bastard! Nope, I saw that. My precious. Well, I don't know about Jordan's, but my setup, it's all coming together. I've got an i5-7400 at a three gigahertz. Ready? So practical. I need me a sick gaming tower. I actually think leaving the case until later is a big tactical error. My way, I can build as I go. Oh, that's smart. I'm tempted to get the one that now works, but there's gotta be something better than Acer built-in piece of crap. Five minutes gone. Oh, are you serious right now? Is this case part of it? I just got the thumbs up. This is my case. Oh, yes. Oh, that was a big score. Be quiet tower case. Tempered glass side panel. I've got two RGB fans already. Five RGB fans already. Sick. Motherboard's kind of a pain in the ass. Good. The better to get ahead of you with, my dear. Yep. I'm getting a little worried about core components here. Yeah. But that's a problem for another time for me. Monitor. Flair one. Yeah, let's go. I might've missed some cases. These are brand new. Now that's a monitor with flair. Does the mining rig count as flair? I think we gotta go with Buzz here. Oh, you piece of crap. I want Buzz. You should have flaired sooner. I knew I should have gone for earlier flair. Snooze you lose, buddy. Go. PSU in case. It's going to be a boring round. Why did I even take power supplies so early? There's so many good power supplies. There's an RM 850 here from Corsair. There's an 850 GT from EVGA that seems to be new in box. Should have taken power supply last. Oh, that's a 750. Ooh. It's a 750 F, but it has RGB. I'm going to take this 850 GT. I don't want to fall behind in my picks here. Oh, nice choice. I was hoping he wouldn't notice those. All right, well, good luck, Linus. CPU and cooler power supply. And I just went through and showed him all the good power supplies. Thanks for that. Whose team am I on? I mean, it matches my case. Oh, we needed this like weeks ago for that wood PC. I mean, he did keep telling us people need this stuff. People need this stuff all the time. Mining will have a bad CPU, right? Oh yeah. That mining rig is going to have whatever the lowest end CPU that fits in that socket is. I'm probably better off with this ancient Dell, whatever it is. Maybe, just maybe, this mining rig wasn't configured correctly and the CPU in here is decent. I5 6500. Whoa, that's way better than I thought it would be. I will take it. I expected a Pentium dual core or something. What a relief. I'm not going to be just completely left in the dust for performance here. Well, I mean, if you're done that pick, we can do the next pick. Flair one, flair two. It's got double as much flair as me. You know how to hack a MacBook password? Uh, I mean, that sounds pretty flair-y to me. If you can pull it off. All right, flair. The G4 Cube. I consider this flair. If I'm not going to do anything with it, it's flair, right? I took a MacBook. Yeah. This matches the aesthetic. There, flair. I'm starting to really question my life choices here. Am I going to find an RGB controller? What does RGB even mean? Can I just take as much RGB as I can find? Like RGB LED strip kit, $49.99 and a couple of VGA extension cables. I'm happy. My turn for RAM. GPU. Wait, did you take this RAM over here? Wait, am I even going to find any RAM? I found three pieces of DDR4 that I'm using. You get three pieces? My board will take four. I was being generous. What the crap? Uh-oh. Oh no. No, no, no. This is DDR4. Jordan, I swear to God, if you took all the DDR4. I literally just had my hands on some over here somewhere. So you should be okay. You claim there's loose DDR4? I saw some a minute ago. He saw some a minute. Wait, I get one stick? We can make a deal later. Mobo. flair. Motherboard. How'd you get a motherboard? I just forgot to take the CPU off it. You had already picked yours anyway. All right, fair enough. Okay, so then next pick. flair 2. Mouse. Rear speaker surround fans. Woo! These can just sit on here. That's nothing a little bit of zip tie magic won't fix. How far behind are you, Jordan? Next pick, here we go. I got two I gotta pick yet. GPU. Monitor. Yeah. Okay, so let's just speed run. I need a flair, a mouse and a monitor. I think you might've lucked out, Linus. Ah. He knew that there was 3080 TI's. I don't think there are 3080 TI's. Did he tell you 3080 TI's? I think he thought he was selling me a 3080 TI. I don't think there's a 3080 TI in here. There might be a 2080 or a 2080 TI though. Oh, I see. In which case, that's probably fine. You know, there's another 3080. Heck yeah, let's go! Now, because I have a flair pick earlier than him, can I take that as flair? No. Oh, here's a really great monitor that if you chose, it would clear space for these GPUs. I'm good. I don't even get a sideways glance for that. Do we have trust problems in our relationship, Jordan? A little bit. You don't believe me? That can be your audio too, Jordan. Dual purpose, baby. You got the boombox? Dang it! And I got an iMice T98. Okay, well, whatever. I got a 3080, so. I'll take a TV. Oh. I didn't even see that. Oh, shoot. My eyes are getting old. Keyboard. flair. Oh, my God, you're gonna get all the good flair. Yeah, right. I picked keyboard before him, so I get a better keyboard, assuming I can find a decent keyboard in this pile of garbage. Hey, mechanical keyboard. Grinning. I'm grinning. I can't tell if that's what that says, but. This kind of matches my aesthetic too, though. Tablet keyboard for Android 3 Plus. Oh, balls. Oh, you got a mouse pad. Wait. And you didn't pick the big RGB one? Yeah, that one's filthy. That's fair. I'm taking the mechanical keyboard. Holy crap, we only have an hour 15. Printer. Printer? This is gonna be a boring round. I'm gonna get the best printer. I don't know if I wrote down printer. Best one. I'll take all the cables. I think that's gonna be extremely challenging. Do I go with the compact laser multifunction center? Ooh. Or the PIXMA MX452. This one can fax and everything. It's tested and working. Why did I even think it was a good idea to pick the printer this early? Color laser. There. I'm gonna take that Lexmark. Enjoy your crappy cables. I have this printer. Yeah. Yeah, you walk away. God, this is heavy. What the hell? Two man lip. It weighs 50 pounds. Did you buy HDMI cables by any chance? Sir, I bought all the HDMI cables. If you can't find them, that's on you. Well, zero could still be all. Wait, I don't, I don't actually see the cables. Is this part of my Mac G4 flair? I think so. I think so. Jordan, this is part of my G4 flair, right? Yeah, okay. Storage. Nice. Neither of us has managed to pick the same thing at the same time even once. I'll take this MX500 SATA M.2. There's an M.2 in here? Got him. Okay, next pick. Oh, goddammit. flair. Audio. Ha, ha, ha. Good luck with your audio. I've got the best audio. Next. Oh, cause you haven't done your- I gotta do a keyboard. Keyboard yet. Yeah, get out of here. Okay. This guy. What is this? Oh God. Oh. Cool. You took all the good flair. I mean, you can go for the memes. I think I might have to go with the inbox star, but oh, actually wait. No, there's other good options. How about the completely worthless bunny stuffy? I heard that if you can find a big enough idiot, they'll pay $300 for one of these. But where are you going to find somebody like that? You know what? I'm taking it. All right, I'm calling it. I'm going with the garbage. Love it. Let's do a pick. Mouse. Audio. Wait, I did audio. Router. That's an odd choice. Okay. I don't know. I couldn't tell you what I was thinking. I don't know if anyone's actually dug through this yet. I saw some EVGA mice. I want one of those. Hey, here you go, buddy. Found you an EDA. It's quality wireless router. Here. You're welcome. I mean, it's a nice box. Yeah. Nothing. I want that EVGA mouse. I don't remember where they were though. I call pick. Perfect timing. EVGA X17 FPS gaming mouse. Let's go. What do you like about that one? I used to have the same thing, so I know how it works. Cables. I'm going straight for that HDMI cable he didn't find. Wait, you moved it. You got it. Dang it. No way. Did I actually find what I need? Star tech. Hard to find. Made easy. You don't have storage either. You must have added things to the list. No, no. DP to mini DP. That's what I need for my stupid monitor. Oh, I'm so happy right now. I wouldn't have been happy to spend $40 on it, but I'm happy. I spent way more than $40 on this. External drive. flair five. I mean, what's the difference? Okay. Oh man. You'd think it wouldn't be that hard to find one. The flair pickings are getting pretty slim. Little bit. Have you seen any hard drives? Hard drives? Hard drives, right? Yeah, some of the systems. Oh, yeah. Enjoy. I'll take this then. I think you're docking port there. Docking thing. In that case, I need this for it. Oh. This is for my external drive. Easy. I don't need this SSD. I just don't want him to have it. flair four. I really need a mouse pad. I think I just have to go with a mouse pad for my flair item. I call a pick. Well, I'm going storage. That's a really good idea. I hope your motherboard supports NVME. I hope so too. I have my doubts. My last two are router and flair five. So I'm kind of thinking we just grab the last two and start building. All right, yeah, I need to get RGB still. Let's go. We have just under an hour. My homie Tenda has got me covered for router. And my last piece of flair was hiding in plain sight. Yes, we fix iPhone, iPad, iPod. Overall, I'm feeling pretty good about my picks here. I've got a decent core system. I've got this excellent 50 pound chair. I think I should get one more stick of RAM. Okay, not from me though. You got three. What do you have? I said you could take a dual channel kit. Is it a matching kit? I have one matching kit. I think you should- They were in a pile. That's a kit. I think, no, no, no. I think, yeah. After the crap you pulled with the SSD. Wow, that's a 16 gig stick. Thanks for picking that one to give me. This is a match. I'm not allowed to have non-matching. Thermal compound. Oh, I don't even need thermal compound. Watch this. I'm gonna show you guys a trick. Yeah, I'm just gonna take the thermal goop that seeped out the edges here and I'm gonna put it back in the middle. No, it'll be fine. Here we go. Now it's more in the middle. Here, I can show you. See, look, that'll spread out. In 45 minutes, I'm gonna be crushing Crysis. While I have a lot of RGB components, this is a mining motherboard. I would be very surprised if it has an RGB header on it. I am not surprised. Oh, she. Oh, no, it's just a hub. Wait. No, it's just a fan hub. I thought it had an RGB controller. Bummer. I stole this from the mining rig because my power supply did not include a four pin. What do you mean it doesn't include a four pin? Well, take a look at my cables here. Find me the four pin. Here. Does that come apart? Yeah. Are you sure? Yeah, very sure. Oh, damn it, I'm blind. And I helped. I want Buzz Lightyear for that. That's a bit far. Is it infinity and beyond far? Ah. I have like 35 minutes to turn it from this pile into a completed setup. And I can't even find the power cable for my stupid computer. I think it says 25 minutes. 25 minutes? How is it that little? Why do we even set these arbitrary time limits on things anyway? Keith said that Buddy bought this machine right at the end of the crash and didn't really get a chance to mine on them, but these look pretty used. And before you say it's probably from gaming, all these plugs are still in place. I ain't never seen a card that was gamed on that has all these plugs in place. What are the odds this just immediately fires up? Wait a second. Is this a monitor or an iMac? Oh, this is an iMac. Okay, well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What happened to the Apple display that we bought then? Oh, there it is. Okay, well, I'm trading it in. It was an honest mistake. You can be forgiven. Where the hell is the power button on this thing? Man, I really do not know older Apple stuff. Studio display doesn't have any buttons and automatically turns on when you plug it into power and connect it to your Mac or iPad. You'll need to make sure your PC has Thunderbolt 3 or Thunderbolt 4, then it's a matter of connecting the cables and firing up both your computer and the studio display. So it is only Thunderbolt. Can I trade my monitor again? Dang it, I've wasted so much time on this stupid monitor just for memes. Oh, he's posted already. Dang it. I gotta play catch up here. You wanna use TVs? Let's use TVs. Don't worry about it. See, when your monitor is this boxy, you don't need a stand. No one bump this desk. Oh, I have some serious regrets about this. We got windows, baby. How do I turn it on? All right. Where's the waste pile? It's dead, dead. The deadest kind of dead. It's a dual monitor set up now. Now it's, I was all about productivity the whole time. What was that? My sound works. You paid 600 bucks, you got some power. I already have windows. Hey, I already got windows installed. Boom. Sick. That just saved this build. Did all my RAM show up? Yes, I have 24 gigabytes of RAM. What speed? 2133. But 24 gigs of RAM and the first 16 of it should theoretically run in dual channel mode with only the last eight gigs running in single channel mode. Well, this sucks. My Airgoo LED strip kit is just strips and a remote. There's no actual RGB controller. I think that's all the RGB I'm going to have folks. One eighth of my desk pad and the mouse and keyboard. Hey Jordan, how are you getting networking? The logistics fairy gave me networking. What? I had a whole plan. I took the only hundred foot networking. What's the resolution? It's definitely not 1080p. It's not amazing. Hey David. Yeah? Neither is mine. These are 1440p. What? Something occurs to me. I got surround sound speakers. Do I have surround sound? Have I got a solution for you Linus? Wait, what do you have? What is this? Encore electronic 7.1 channel USB audio box. Oh, it's not in there. Oh, it is. Oh, it's in there. Somehow in our haste, we left behind the speaker wire for the left and center channels. So I may have to improvise a little. I mean, the right speaker wire doesn't need to be this long, right? Some speed stripping right here. I may have a very stupid and unexpected problem. I don't have any three and a half millimeter cables for direct surround out. Either out of the back of the motherboard or this. What do you got? You're part way there. Oh, that's one extension. Thank you, Jordan. You're welcome, Linus. I need male to male. Now I know what you're thinking right now. This is a pretty sick looking setup, but get this. I haven't even put up my flair yet. Oh yeah. Do these add or detract? The add, there's a face now. It's a face. Nice. Now Linus, I can't help but notice that one of our computers is running Crysis right now. Walking it. I'll show him running Crysis. Oh, keyboard, find the files. Yeah, it's time to find out if this audio box works. This is, is there, oh, hello. Okay. Let's just put this here. Whoa, what are the odds there's a driver for this? Hey, how are you doing over there, Jordan? I got killed. Sorry, I can't hear you. I don't know if it's that game. I remember this game being prettier. But it's been a while. It's running okay. It's running fine, yeah. System's almost ready for showtime. Just gonna give it a little wipe down with the world's most expensive cleaning cloth. Yeah, hold your guitar. You should have gone for the speakers first. It's gotta be the vibrations being passed through the case that it's not designed for that. It needs the shoulder. Exactly, that's how science works. This is not better. That's a one. Overall, I like your flair. I wish I could have it. You see, I have my Buzz Lightyear MacBook stand. Yeah, I don't think this counts as computer RGB. But see, RGB is a tool to the devil. So this is my concession to having to include some. I see. Also, the board doesn't support RGB. Yeah, mine either. Forgot to take the peel off your window. I'm gonna have to dock marks for that. I know you enjoy doing that, so I left it for you. No, that's not what happened. You didn't notice. I noticed I didn't care. All right, let's see the gaming. Realistically, you guys are gonna be the judge of who did it better. Does this run at 60 hertz? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, definitely. And what resolution is this exactly? Just about 1080p. Just about 1080p. I have to shrink it down to fit the monitor. I see. There's no over scan support. Yeah, we're not gonna get much of a stereo effect like this. Also, this display looks like crap. Little bit. It flickers on camera. Oh, really? How's that walking sound? Is the contrast supposed to be at 100? Is that the default position for this TV? So that would be the default. You know what? I bet it's not. I bet that this is the default. Let's see if that did not get better. I also don't know how to get out of the menu. I'm noticing this. I unplugged it and plugged it back in to get out of the menu. You should have bought the remotes. What were you thinking? I didn't know I didn't buy them. Seriously, this just never closes? I have no idea. Right? There. This part of the game is still super pretty. Unfortunately, your setup does not do it justice at all. I think that's gonna cost you with the judges. Well, all I can say is mine worked first. He's right. I went significantly over time. I just like the judges to notice how much better my flair is. That versus Buzz Lightyear. How is that better than- Versus Buzz Lightyear. Versus Buzz Lightyear with RGB standing on a MacBook Pro. Oh yeah. This song is sick. Oh my goodness. Oh man, I was team Buzz, but I don't know, dude. This one cost $600. That one cost $300. You got robbed, buddy. In addition to my better flair, remember, I have this guy who kind of looks like a little mouth with big bug eyes. Okay, he's right there. He's watching you game. He's cute. And my sound setup. You can feel it in your guts. Slightly more intelligible. Also, we fixed iPhone, iPad, iPod. So if you have any of those things that are broken and need fixing, you'll be really happy you came to Linus' gaming setup. Yeah, I got worse frame rates, but I'm running at 1440p with 8x anti-aliasing. This looks sharp AF. Smaller screen, though. Yeah, but you know. Size isnt everything! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, little guy. One thing I will have to admit is that my 6th Gen Core i5 is definitely bottlenecking this 3080 a little. Look at that. A whopping 51 frames per second. Let us know in the comments, who do you think built the better system? Jordan with his Buzz Lightyear? More like Buzz Loser year. Or me, with my rockin' rabbit. Ah, now, now wait. The cherry on top. I think this setup rocks. Just like our sponsor. FlexiSpot. It's hard to find an office or gaming chair that combines comfort, support, and durability. The three pillars of booty care. Thankfully, the C7 Premium Ergonomic Chair fits the bill. Its 20-inch cushion moves forward and backward, and tilts to enhance circulation in your tush so it doesn't go numb during those long work sessions. Its lumbar support cradles your lower back throughout its 90 to 128 degree recline range, so you can sit like a peasant while feeling like a king. And thanks to its high-grade materials, the C7 comes with a 10-year warranty. That is a long time to be sitting down, though. So upgrade your workspace or your play space with the C7. And if you need a desk to go with your new chair, you can check out FlexiSpot's E7 Pro series for peak office core aesthetic and function. Click the link below and get 30% off your C7 or E7 series with code LTT30, no minimum purchase necessary. If you guys enjoyed this video, maybe go check out part one, where we hauled all of this stuff away from a local tech shop for pretty much whatever price they asked, which, as it turns out, was way too much.",

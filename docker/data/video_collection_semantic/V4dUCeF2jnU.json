    "transcript": "no I'm sorry this is not the i5 4460 verse I 360 100 review that's coming very soon I knew I keep saying that but if it's coming very soon in the meantime hey everyone great here with science studio and what we will do in the meantime is we're going to compare the new Intel i3 6100 to the AMD FX 6300 so I understand that the FX series is very popular it was very popular when it first came out and it still is to the stage because it's cheap and it's powerful but how powerful is it and is it more powerful than Intel's newest i3 2 core 4 thread processors so I know right out of the gate you're probably thinking well the FX 6300 has six cores it's a hexa core processor it has a lot more processing power right I mean even if the CPU frequencies don't match six courses is always better than four cores right or two cores and four threads right so the test we're going to run fall into two different categories the first three tests that we have are going to be CPU independent so that means that the GPU really won't be doing anything at all it will just stress the CPU itself and the three tests that we've chosen are one the Cinebench CPU tests so we'll be using Cinebench r15 just to do raw CPU performance test the Geekbench 3 software so we'll just be doing the cheap 32-bit let's not native cheap it's free the free 32-bit Geekbench 3 tests so we'll be able to test the single core performance and the multi-core performance of each processor and then we've also kind of put together a little adobe premiere rendering test so I have a 1-minute video file and I rendered it through both machines and I just recorded the times that it took to render the same file on both and then we chose three games we chose dying light grand theft auto 5 and dota 2 in those cases highest FPS wins simple as that and you'll see why we chose those three games here in a second so the test benches for both of these CPUs are going to be completely different there's just nothing we can do about it one uses ddr3 one uses ddr4 one uses an am3+ socket and one uses an LGA 1151 socket so there's no way to compare them equally I mean that's what you get for comparing a four-year old processor with a 1-year old processor it's just that's just what you have to deal with but for the AMD processor our test bench consists of the following we used an Asus m5 1897 revised 2.0 motherboard so this is an am3+ socket motherboard and we also threw in two four gigabyte sticks of ddr3 clocked at 1600 megahertz which is kind of the run-of-the-mill ddr3 frequency so nothing really outlandish there and the other thing to note is that we did overclock the CPU to 4 gigahertz now before you freak out we also overclock the i3 to 4 gigahertz as well and if you're wondering how on earth I overclock and i3 check out this video here and I will show you how to do that not really difficult at all if you have a z170 motherboard but ok anyway on the intel side of things i will be using my personal rig this one right here so this has an asrock z170 pro for LGA 1151 motherboard in it and we also have 2 4 gigabyte sticks as well but this time of ddr4 and these are clocked and we make sure get this right these are clocked at 2346 megahertz for a total of 8 gigabytes also in dual channel now if you're wondering why the ram frequency is a bit funky well it has to do with the fact that I overclock using the base clock method so when I turn up my base clock I'm not only increasing my CPU frequency but I'm also increasing my RAM frequency so my dims were raised as a result from a base of 21.3 3 times 100 which is 2133 to 21.3 3 times 110 which gave me a value of 20 346 so if you're wondering why that's that that's why I know the RAM speeds are gonna match regardless but pay that's an incentive for going with a newer platform you get ddr4 and you get higher clock speeds naturally so that's just part of the recipe in this case oh and I should mention we are using identical r9 380 graphics cards they are clocked exactly the same ones that sapphire and one's a gigabyte but they're exactly the same they even use the exact same PCB so that we've made sure has remained constant in both platforms now that the platforms are out of the way and you know what we're running in both scenarios let's get straight into the benchmarks which I know you've been waiting for so which one really is better the i3 60 100 or the FX 6300 first benchmark test on the list is the Cinebench benchmark and well the scores were they were expected the I three two cores and four threads is really underperformed compared to the FX 6300 tech Sakura texture so the i3 scored a 435 and the FX scored a 453 now I know this graph looks a little strange to you it looks like the FX just blew the i3 out of the water but if you look at the the bottom the x-axis there you'll see that everything's been scaled to within like 50 points or so so we also made an adjusted score graph and this one kind of puts things into perspective a little better so you can see that really the i3 didn't do that much worse than the FX processor I mean they were very relatively close I think the i3 only scored 18 points under the FX so for only being a two core 4/3 processor it did well to keep up with the FX 6300 so if you're wondering how Cinebench works whenever you click the Run button you'll see a series of yellow squares start to kind of form a spiral shape out from the center and the number of yellow squares is determined by how many threads your CPU runs on so if your processor has four threads you can only have four yellow squares running at any time to render that image so in the case of the FX 6300 6 yellow squares could be rendered at any given time whereas for i3 even though it has hyper-threading it still only has four threads so it was only able to render four yellow squares at a time so just a quick little run-through of how Cinebench works but anyway let's move on to Geekbench Geekbench 3 is up next and these outcomes there were bit different so the i3 scored a single core score of 4098 this is actually like the third or fourth I can't remember I think it's the third highest score of any CPU that's ever been tested on Geekbench and that's just because of the new architecture the new skylake architecture that the 14 nanometer technology just kind of takes the cake here you can see that the i3 did perform much better in single core a single core now multi-core a lot of things step all over the i3 but for single core performance that that really is not bad for how much you're paying for the processor and of course they did only score an 87 24 multi but that's actually better than the FX is multi score of 84 or 47 and you can also see the FX single core performance was not too shabby at all it actually is about half as efficient by these standards as the i3 so yeah so even though the FX 6300 does have two more cores and hence two more threads the i3 is still better as a multi-core processor at least in this test on I'm not trying to step on your toes but in this particular test the i3 wins so let's move on from that I don't want to keep you on that one for too much longer the Adobe Premiere Pro test so what I did was I took a one-minute video file it was just just a movie clip something I filmed and I trimmed it down to just one minute I couldn't get it exactly a woman if it was like one minute and point oh three seconds or something like that and I rendered that video clip on both platforms I made sure nothing else was running I made sure to use the exact same preset for both and these were the time so the i3 was able to render the video file in one minute and twenty two point seven three seconds very impressive actually so for a ten minute file it's only going to take about fifteen minutes to render it's not bad at all now remember here the the shorter the bar the better so you want to lower score in this case the FX and it will only scored two minutes and three seconds I shouldn't say only I mean it scored more it scored two minutes and three point zero one seconds took a bit longer hold 40 seconds all notes so I don't know what conclusions you can make from that particularly but what it tells me is that the i3 utilizes its four threads more efficiently than the FX processor does so that's basically what I concluded from it but of course you're free to make your conclusions I'm just showing you the graphs because this stuff stuff took a while to come up with so let's move on from that and let's get into the stuff that I know you actually do care about and that is the gaming performance how well does each platform run the three games that we've chosen so the first up was dying light nice zombie game kind of like GTA in a way I mean it's it's an open-world so you can kind of just do whatever you want unless you want to do the missions and I made sure that in both cases I ran to the exact same places I just use fraps to record the minimum average and highest FPS rate and there you go now keep in mind that these are both running identical r9 380 s and we noticed from the first batch of results that dying light really is not a a few intensive game like at all our scores were very consistent so I guess you could say that well it could mean one of two things either the CPUs are identical and the GPUs are identical or the game just doesn't really care much about the CPU performance and is solely a graphics card performer and so you will see in a second that it is only a graphics card performer because things change when we hop into GTA 5 now you probably know by now just because of the fact that I've said it probably a hundred times on other videos that Grand Theft Auto 5 is a very CPU intensive game this is where we should start to see one processor pull ahead of the other one did but is it the one that you expected the Intel i3 was the clear winner in this case it achieved an average FPS nearly ten frames above the FX 6300 and was able to reach much higher max frame rates as well we made sure that vsync was off and we kept all the settings exactly the same in both cases now gameplay with smooth for both don't get me wrong I mean 40 FPS looks pretty similar to 50 FPS but that's a 10 FPS difference and that that means a lot to a lot of people so that's what we wanted to show you in this particular scenario that you can edge out an extra 10 to 15 FPS in GTA 5 if you choose to forego the FX 6300 and off for the newer until I 360 100 so last on our list is dota 2 and if you're not a GTA 5 or dying light gamer chances are you're probably a dota 2 gamer so that's why we chose this one but wow what's dota 2 super hungry for graphics I mean it craved processing cores it was heating up my GPU more than grand theft auto 5 I did not expect it at all but it just confirmed the fact that we made a good decision to choosing builder 2 so we max everything out we made sure that we were running in full 1080p on both platforms and it seems like dota 2 doesn't really rely on either the CPU or the GP but prefers like a mix like a co-op I don't know something like that co-op but the Intel side of things did edge out a slight lead in this case all around from the average FPS to the max to the minimum there was about a 5 to 10 FPS so I think in this case if you were a dota 2 player or like a World of Warcraft game or something like that you're probably not going to have a problem just forgoing the i3 and choosing the FX 6300 so you're not going to see it enough of an increase in my opinion to spend the extra money on the i3 so that's what I want you to get out of this you've seen all of the results and you've probably concluded the i3 is a bit better in games and in just raw CPU performance but does that justify the extra price well I would say that roughly six months ago it wouldn't have justified the price because the ddr4 and LGA 1151 platform was still super expensive I mean to get ddr4 you have to drop at least a hundred bucks on like an eight gig kit now you can get ddr4 for roughly the same price as ddr3 prices for socket LGA 1151 have come down significantly over the past year and that's why I believe that choosing the i3 6100 over the FX 6300 is a wise choice look you can build on both platforms for roughly the same price this one that I built behind me cost $650 in parts but the FX build that I built before that one cost about the same it was like six hundred twenty dollars and I got the exact same graphics card so it's not much more that I can tell you I believe that i3 is the way to go yeah you're gonna have less cores but if those six cores and the FX processors aren't going to run as efficiently then there's no point in even purchasing a six core processor right so I don't know if you're an AMD fanboy and I mean no disrespect by that because I was at one point as well wait till Sun comes out see how Zen treats you but if you're very desperate to build a gaming PC on a budget right now I would go I three I think it's a no-brainer thanks for watching everyone if you like the benchmarks if you like the stuff that we showed you in this video be sure to give us a thumbs up but if you hated the video outright and just thought it with straight crap give us a thumbs down let us know in the comments below what you'd like to see next and what you'd like to see improved in future videos be sure to subscribe for more there will be more because we said so this is science studio

    "transcript": "this is the new Microsoft Surface laptop. Something which normally would be about as exciting as a PowerPoint update but what lives inside this laptop could Herald in the windows arm-mageddon. wow that was really bad and while you recover from that one today's video is once again sponsored by Micro Center which may be micro in name but massive in heart for June new customers get $25 off all processors must be first time customer in store to redeem in other news Charlotte Micro Center is officially open so go check it out there's a whole bunch of information about exclusive location discounts it'll be in the link down below and Microcenter is opening another store in Miami for you to go and buy Tech Parts in between fighting alligators or whatever click the link down below and sign up for Early Access to get a free8 gig flash drive when the store officially opens [Music] now on first impression of the little surface it's clear Microsoft has been copying Apple's homework this thing just screams Starbucks eping wait a minute did I accidentally buy a Macbook what's going on here this thing looks so much like a little MacBook even down to the radius of the rounding on the corners I know that sounds ridiculous but it looks wildly MacBook the main differences are just that this comes with a square USB port something that's way too useful to exist on an Apple product and it's maybe not built as well the panel gaps don't quite have that same psychotic level of evenness but all of that is a good thing this is a really lovely laptop that also doesn't quite open one-handed as easily as a Macbook does uh but yeah it's a beautiful laptop its trackpad feels nice it also has a similar Mac Booky kind of haptic feedback to the clicks the keyboard is I I guess which again is very on brand it also has a beautiful 14-in high resolution touch display in it which is behind what feels like a glass surface that is very reflective but it's it's a really nice display it measures very well and because I'm going to try and game on this poor helpless little thing hopefully the display's motion rendering is better than a Macbook which is put to shame by an EXA sketch but none of that's super interesting the main thing I want to look at lives inside the laptop now it seems like Microsoft doesn't really want us getting inside this laptop because the screws I can only imagine are hidden under the feet but hopefully they kind of come off easily oh yeah the feet are this little stopper which is replaceable it wasn't held down by Glue so never mind that is quite a neat implementation oh yeah it's it's just lifted up here wa that's like the easiest laptop back I've gotten off in in a very long time that's really cool the reason the back's so easy to get off is because instead of plastic Clips it's held on by magnets so you don't have to shatter The laptop's Virginity when opening it up neat once inside this laptop does have beautiful guts although the only thing that's upgradeable is the SSD which honestly for this class of laptop is much better than I was expecting now the consolation prize upgradability is not why I'm excited by this laptop this laptop is exciting because it doesn't have an Intel AMD CPU in it it has a snap dragon X+ in it which aside from it having dragon in the name which objectively makes it cooler and a bunch of the now obligatory dumb borderline concerning AI crap in it the Snapdragon chip is Arm based like apple silicon chips and likely the processor powering the phone that you're watching this video on which is awesome because arm CPUs tend to be very efficient so you get long battery life low temperatures and if it's running software coded for arm architecture it can also be very powerful the problem tends to come when you want to run software that doesn't know what arm is like most video games in fact probably all of the good ones as far as I know that was a comment specifically for all you arm-based console enjoyers that are probably already halfway through typing out your enraged comment down below now luckily Microsoft does have a translation layer built into it which is pretty cool and hopefully works well but in my experience these compatibility layers is kind of like using Google Translate to read a book yeah sure you'll get the gist of what the book is about but it's going to be a really slow and frustrating process to read the thing now I've already run some cine bench on it and it gave some respectable results even without it plugged in but let's see how it deals with gaming now unlike Steam on Mac OS because we're running the Steam on Windows it thinks that all of these games are compatible so we don't even get that Half Baked some of these games won't work implementation that you get on Mac OS and if Apple's silicon steam game compatibilities anything to go by this isn't going to go too great and I immediately ran into a problem for some reason the laptop refused to read my external game drive through the USBC ports and after trying a bunch of different cables which didn't work the thing that fixed it was plugging it into the type a port and after fixing that problem I launched CS2 which initially worked fine but while trying to apply some video settings the game crashed and then it just refused to ever launch again so off to about as good a start as I was expecting but luckily my fortune changed with cyberpunk wow that looks really terrible what is going on here this is without Fidelity FX and there's this almost like VHS effect over it frame rate is not doing great 14 frames per second at 1080p low not super impressive to be honest but I can't get past the visual artifact going on here look at the text now I've not really seen this 8bit pixelation artifact before so I'm guessing it's got something to do with prism and there also seems to be a phasing in of that effect it's kind of smooth when you move around and then here it slowly phases in it's like a low quality sharpening effect I guess and even for 14 frames per second the input lag is wild look at that you can raise a family in the time it takes the game to respond to my mouse inputs we're going to need to do some Fidelity FX to make this playable oh I mean if anything the Fidelity FX is kind of fixed that visual artifact wow that's weird I don't think I've ever seen adding Fidelity FX increase visual Fidelity before and the input lag while better is still pretty terrible it is very quiet for a laptop doing gaming and it is boiling like here that's it's burning my fingers to the touch with that I just quickly want to try running it at its native resolution whoa that's made the input lag quite a bit worse I'm actually surprised that Qualcomm didn't use this as an example of the power of this machine when they were busy hyping it up cuz this is very impressive stuff anyway so it runs cyber Punk let's see what else we can play on it the next game I tried was Destiny 2 which refused to to work because of complications with battle ey Doom Eternal was also very skeptical of my vendor for some reason luckily aside from some struggles applying 1080p resolution with Dota 2 it ran although not very enthusiastically ooh oh no they were saying it's going to offer close to Native performance and I really hope that this isn't close to Native system performance because wow but luckily after a while of the system climatizing to the game it started running a lot better so once you get over the initial terrible seizures I guess it's running fine at 1080p low settings although maybe fine is wishful thinking that frame time graph is very inconsistent and the game feels heavy with not a particularly High frame rate yeah this ooh really not a great gaming experience at least it doesn't have that same visual bug that cyberpunk did so it's got that going for it wow GTA 5 is not very confident in the gaming ability of this device defaulting to 800 by 600 o I get why it suggested those settings now because I've changed it to 1080p lowest and um it's not going great for a game that isn't a graphical Powerhouse anymore wow the frame rate's really inconsistent and while I was pointing at the frame time graph that couldn't make up its mind something weird happened you can see this wild tearing wait why did touching the touchcreen help the frame rate so much it also fixed the tearing what what in the oh oh never never mind yeah it also fixed the really bad tearing that was happening so I guess every now and then you just got to touch the touch screen to confirm this Paranormal Activity I kept playing the game until the frame pacing drowned in the toilet again and then when I touched the touchscreen it fixed it okay it's running like crap again so let's and it fixes it that's so weird what in the world it feels way better again I think then decided to try and power an external display via dongle something I've had trouble with on MacBooks before oh there we go display is happening just to be hit with GTA San Andreas refusing to launch despite me using the fix which apparently fixes this error The Last of Us two also refused to associate with our arm laptop pubg also got mad when I tried to launch that and Starfield just pretended not to hear my launch requests and when hell divers 2 also conscientiously objected I gave up and tried some halflife 2 a obviously halflife 2 runs on it although not super well wait a minute is bsync on it it is it is on disable okay wow that was almost a real embarrassing for this laptop but there we go we've got 240 is frames per second but things weren't quite as straightforward sometimes it's smooth sometimes it's stuttery there's also whatever that is that occasionally flashes up in the top there and also kind of has a little bit of that 8 bitty vibe that we saw with cyberpunk on the laptop's display yeah there's just a bunch of strange artifacting and flickering and stuff going on so the first game we found that's properly playable is still kind of on drugs just a little bit and then when I switched back to the display in the laptop terrible things happened oh that's not good what the hell the display just broke the only way I could fix this terrible artifacting was by replugging in and unplugging the external display but over the next couple of days using the laptop that issue kept popping up you can really tell that the products early in its life cycle so with that what did we learn in today's video well apparently gaming on an arm laptop not designed for gaming doesn't give a very good experience that's some very useful information right there which brings me to the end of the video subscribe if you like the video thank you for watching and until the next one bye-bye [Music] w

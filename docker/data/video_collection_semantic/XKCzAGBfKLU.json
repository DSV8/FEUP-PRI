    "transcript": "Many consider net neutrality a political argument and I try to stay out of politics on a largely science derived channel but nothing about net neutrality needs to be political I'm gonna give you in this video a synopsis of what the current net neutrality rules dictate why you have the free internet that you have and what things might look like if the net neutrality laws were repealed in a nutshell net neutrality refers to our rights as occupants of the United States to open an unrestricted networks ISP other internet service providers are lawfully bound to provide unrestricted access to all web sites deemed lawful in the eyes of the government basically everything that doesn't violate US or international law the rights of others or rights of corporations ISPs are not allowed to choke or bar mirror you access to any website the u.s. deems lawful that's basically any website that doesn't sell things that are illegal or show things that are illegal those are the two main things I can think of at this point so if my current service provider Wow one of the two is PS and Panama City decided to suddenly ignore net neutrality altogether what they could do is bar me from certain websites that can bar me from competitors anything NBC related comes to mind so xfinity comcast there's news outlets that could also restrict access or throttle access to sites like Netflix Hulu and even YouTube in 2015 the FCC that's the Federal Communications Commission classified broadband providers like Verizon Comcast CenturyLink and AT&T as title to common carriers this means that in the eyes of common law ISPs are simply the mediums of exchange the carriers of information between the infrastructure because nobody owns the Internet and the consumer and it makes sense think of it like a mail delivery system if you PS was suddenly bound by mail neutrality laws then they wouldn't be able to show preference to certain neighborhoods as in neighborhoods it may be look really nice they're nice to drive through they look really great they have large big yards and huge fences and four or five stories of peace those are the neighborhoods that UPS chooses deliver to first and they may not even get to the the older more run-down poor neighborhoods because they're just you know they don't feel like doing it so those people in the poor places might not even get their packages on time might not even get them the same day or the same week in fact UPS without mail neutrality could decide - just not deliver the packages at all at which point what would you do use FedEx or USPS but then what if both of them as well decided to not deliver to your place what would you what would you do how would you were send or receive packages that's what would happen if mail neutrality suddenly disappeared now we don't have those laws obviously USPS FedEx UPS want your business and there's a decent and a healthy amount of competition there but with ISPs where competition is literally non-existent in some places it becomes a huge problem now obviously we have the option to pay more for two-day and overnight shipping but all mail neutrality requires in this hypothetical situation is that those packages shipped within each price and bracket be delivered without bias toward particular neighborhoods the same is true for ISPs under net neutrality I pay about 80 bucks a month for cable and 500 Meg's down and I have a friend who pay 60 bucks for cable and a hundred Meg's down I expect a 500 megabyte per second cap when I download content I know I won't always get 500 Meg's but I expect it to be evenly distributed across all websites I visit my friend expects 100 in the same light simple as that but what we don't expect is to be throttled when we visit sites deemed less important or conflicting in the eyes of our provider one reason that neutrality is such a hot-button topic right now apart from the fact that legislation my team at Nolen void a few months or years is that people are getting frustrated with their current ISPs if you're watching up to this point the video I want you to comment down below with your available internet service providers in your area and then take a look at a few others above and below you you'll find that quite a number of people have access to only one or two providers without pricing strategies under a competitive model these monopolies essentially can charge whatever they want for cable is seen in South Park has never been more accurate because it's your local cable company the customer is always our if net neutrality was suddenly repealed or even eased back to some degree things may look very different online and here's a scarier part they might look different for both you and I if we're in different areas because we have different ISPs that's super sketchy that's literally censorship and that's why net neutrality is so important to our infrastructure we rely on open and free access to information untampered and uncensored but if things continue down this road we may have access to only a couple of news media it's local stations and websites and since most people are bound to their current ISP they won't have a choice about what they can or can't see I'll leave you with this this is mr. Ajit pie chairman of the FCC the one spearheading net neutrality repeals he was previously a Verizon lawyer Verizon is the second largest Internet service provider in the United States now I've never been a proponent of big government intervention this touches in politics and I'll stop here but I'm 100% against mr. Pie's argument that repealing net neutrality quote puts engineers and entrepreneurs instead of bureaucrats and lawyers back in charge of the internet end quote despite whatever he or the FCC says about current net neutrality rules I am contented with what I have now I'm not in fear of any throttling at all for any web site that I visit and that's how it should be it's free open access to information without restrictions I shouldn't have to pay more to visit Netflix than I do to visit Amazon because Amazon is owned by my ISP or maybe Amazon and my ISP or buddy-buddy and they hate Netflix and decide to throttle Netflix or make me pay a lot more for access to it that could also happen under repeal the net neutrality rules if we suddenly had corporations like Verizon AT&T Xfinity and Wow saying well we prefer to use our on-demand systems over Netflix and Hulu we're just gonna charge you a bit more for Netflix than what netflix already charges you if you want access to it from our service that's the really messed up stuff it's big business taking advantage of the infrastructure they have to charge you more money so that they can get guess what bigger I'm not trying to scare you into believing Miam I actually encourage you to do this research yourself this video is more less a call to action and bringing to light this very concerning topic you might not be able to see me in six months to a year you might have to pay more to see me six months to a year from now YouTube should be free right included with the access to the Internet you pay your service provider but you might have to pay a little more to get access to YouTube a scary thought if you like this video be sure to give it a thumbs up thumbs down for the opposite click the subscribe button if you haven't already and stay tuned for more content like this it's a science studio thanks for alerting with us",

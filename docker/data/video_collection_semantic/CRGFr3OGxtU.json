    "transcript": "good evening good people it is 11 p.m. my flights at 6:00 in the morning so I have a little bit of time to sleep going to London for the new Oneplus 6 launch should be fun your device you should be able to deliver whatever you need whenever you need it so I'm packing super light but the force cannot avoid the tripod the thing is it all started with this interesting invitation I'm sure the phone is shaped this way and also we have this two side glass so I guess you can expect what comes next alright time to sleep I'll see you guys in London alright good people welcome to London the event is about to start I'm about to head out but first a quick city tour that's right all right we're here where's the sign there you go all right so the main takeaway with this oneplus 6 launch is that it's both fast and smooth something that oneplus has always delivered to us so with their latest generation smartphone I feel like and that's exactly what carplay wanted to emphasize so I've been using the 5T ever since launch and so the main differences between that and the oneplus 6 is that the alert slider has now been moved above the power button so that might conflict with your thumb placement the screen has also received a slight bump in size because of that additional top left in the right areas but Android is not fully ready for that notch implementation yet so it doesn't fully is not utilized properly in full screen apps so I feel like we're just not there yet and I've been told by many who own the iPhone 10 that the iOS implementation of the notch is much better for applications where it actually utilizes that area for other things within the app unlike on the Android version but it's still a beautiful display it's OLED so blacks or inky and the DI cp3 color mode looks awesome the fingerprint sensor has been changed from a circle to the surrounded rectangle and dual vertical cameras are now in the center for symmetry I do like their upgrades for the camera so the sensor is now 19% larger the pixels are larger so we get better low-light performance there's additional bokeh effects for the portrait mode which is kind of silly but really cool to see how they can take it with software and I'm really excited to see their slow motion mode at 480 fps at 720p resolution so the resolution is a bit on the low side but you can record up to admit it and then cut out only the portion that you need so you're not necessarily struggling to capture the perfect moment you have a little bit of leeway to capture that in slow motion as expected this is a dual glass phone but surprisingly it's actually more grippy than my aluminum 5 T once you get some human oils on it and it actually looks stunning when clean with this curved reflection look I think for video coverage it's an awesome attraction but only on the glossy version as the main block looks kind of bland while the limited edition white and gold is stunning with this unique smooth texture on the glass now this departure from an aluminum body is convex affected as they go along with the flow of other smartphones but there is no wireless charging they're still a headphone jack so no problems there and a type C port - charging a favorite feature of mine on the 5T and it's kind of funny how Carl only wanted to spend one minute on specs because they're kind of irrelevant it's a fast phone with lots of RAM and storage it loads games faster and game mode and reduces unnecessary loading of graphics for apps to save on battery and so the oneplus 6 almost feels like this perfect Android smartphone with clean oxygen OS but I'm not sure I'm ready to ditch my 5t just yet because the notch design really bugs me at how the sides are slightly angled coming down and this proportions for the notch don't seem natural I think I would have liked it to have been wider and not as tall but regardless I think it's just a matter of me getting used to it and now let's hear what others think of what oneplus could have done differently for the oneplus 6 what's up guys sap from super SAP CBI if there was one thing that I changed in the oneplus 6 it would be for it to have wireless charging it's got a glass back so you know technically you would have been possible and I'm somebody who does use a wireless charging not all the time but occasionally so it would be nice to have that but otherwise I'm pretty lucky phone everybody this is dawn one thing that I would change is how the knotch works like okay they're not just here is the 2018 thing I'm okay with it I can deal with it but just seems like a lot of Android software isn't ready for the knotch like there's nothing special happening here in most apps it just hides a notch anyway so that kind of leads me to wonder what's the point unless we have software that's dedicated to take advantage of hey what's up everybody this is Danny I think the biggest thing with the glass design is I wish there was wireless charging that's probably one of the biggest things about it but I'm actually worried about the IP rating on this thing because with glasses eyes you see IP six to seven IP 68 but they said it was resistant at everyday slashes which makes me think is IP 53 so I would like to see an official IP 67 or 68 rating on this thing so I that's one thing that I wish they would have changed on the oneplus what's up guys it's Carl here one thing that I would change if you guys saw this silk white I would have actually had preferred if it was the white and say like a gunmetal not too sure about the rose gold just a minor thing on the design end but overall looking for it easy hey what's up everybody it's Jonathan and if there was one thing I could change about the oneplus 6 it would be to have dual speakers like a dual speaker system I think they kind of missed out on that a lot of smartphone manufacturers are adding that I think they could have really had a little bit more to introduce with the oneplus 6 to do it about them alright guys so the one thing that's really kind of bothers me about the oneplus 6 is the curvature of the bottom of this play to me it doesn't match up the frame per so the actual screen curvature is not identical to the frame curvature because the screen is slightly higher and it gives you this illusion that something is off now the price point has remained and the similar price bracket as the 5T that's a good thing and we have a 256 gigabyte version available coming out under $700 that's pretty good and so with this launch I feel like oneplus has won a larger android market share with the oneplus 6 I feel like it's a balanced package in terms of specs to price to performance and we kind of already know what to expect from oneplus so there's no like totally complete surprises and I would say that's a good thing and I just hope they're smooth and fast mentality doesn't translate into a shorter six month cycle for the eventual 6t because that's kind of what happened the oneplus 5 and the six month later 5T join the wireless club with Corsairs new dark core Mouse play the way you want with nine programmable buttons aligned in the comfortable shape and fantastic sensor you can trust and crazy good Wireless performance plus Qi wireless charging built-in focus on the game the dark core will do the rest all right so let me know what you think of the oneplus 6 are you picking one up and if not why not let me know in the comments below i'm Dmitry thanks so much for watching check out this other relevant content and we'll see you in next video",

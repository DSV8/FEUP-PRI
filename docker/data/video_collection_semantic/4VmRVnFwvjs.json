    "transcript": "- Hey, guys, it's Justine, and today, we have got an incredible unboxing for you. Today, we're gonna be going over some of Walmart's Black Friday deals. Recently, I was on Good Morning America with Walmart, and we were talking about all of these incredible products. If you guys missed it, I will put a link in the description, if you wanna watch the segment. Oh my God. - [Man] There it is - The last item is here. - [Man] You gonna sign that? - [Delivery Man] Yes. - Thank you. This could quite possibly be one of my favorite deals. Oh my goodness. A huge thank you to Walmart for sponsoring this video. Black Friday starts on Walmart.com on Wednesday, 11/27 at 10 pm Eastern. In-store, Black Friday starts on Thursday, 11/28 at 6 pm, your local store's time. There's also special Black Friday buy-now deals starting today on Walmart.com, while the supplies last. I'll also put a link in the description, so be sure to check it out. We're gonna start with this. This is a hoverboard plus go-kart combo. I am honestly so in shock, because I remember the whole hoverboard craze a few years ago and these things were so expensive. So not only are you getting a hoverboard, but you're also getting a go-kart combo. It has LED lights, 6 1/2 inch tires, seven miles per hour, six miles per charge. Oh boy, this is gonna be great. I'm opening this one first, so I can get this all charged up and take it out for a little ride Oh, I'm opening it wrong. I love black Friday. Here's the seat, soft and cushiony. Here's all the backrest. Oh nice, well I guess I'm gonna charge this up and while this charges I'm gonna unbox something else. What are you doing? What are you doing? You, is this soft? You like sitting here now. The hoverboard is charging and now it's time to unbox some more stuff. Next up, we've got the Crosley Cruiser. It's crazy that vinyl is making such a comeback and what's great about this, is it's small, it's portable, it comes in multiple colors and it's only $30. This one is really pretty. It's a nice like purple, lavenderish color. I also have some records here to test it out. It has this nice little suitcase style which makes it extremely portable. Whoa, it's actually really soft. It's made of like this velvet material. I didn't get a chance to see this up close when I was in Good Morning America. It was already opened and set up. I'm really liking this. It's so soft. It also has a headphone jack just in case you wanna have a private listening experience of your vinyl. Let's plug this in, give it a try. I'm trying to not touch it. This is old tech for me. I'm learning. Let's test out the Bluetooth. So I just went in, I'm connecting to bluetooth. So right here it found the Crosley. That must mean I'm connected so now, I'm going to play a YouTube video of my own. This is my last year video I did with Walmart. What do we have up next? This next one, pretty excited about. This is the instant pot air fryer so you guys may be familiar with Instant Pot Duo, they've got all kinds of amazing appliances but this, is an air fryer. Let's see what's in here. Spoiler alert, we're gonna make french fries. This is $49, I was just checking my prices, that's actually pretty shocking. 6-quarts vortex, four-in-one air fry, roast, bake and reheat. Healthy and tasty. This is kind of great because I love fried food but obviously the health benefits are not the best. So with this, you're frying with air instead of like, oils and you're avoiding all of those unhealthy fats. Hello friend. Thin cut fries, we're gonna air fry slash roast 14 to 18 minutes and we're going to set the temperature to 385 degrees Fahrenheit. Shake partway. Air fry and roast, look at that, I can just adjust it. 385, so we're preheating. This is going, oh add food, right now? Right, right now you want me to add the food. Okay, okay, oh my gosh it's already, the time, the timer has started. Fries are in. Okay I'm gonna set it for 18 minutes and it says to shake partway through so in a few minutes I'm gonna give it a little shake. While the fries are air frying we're gonna unbox some of the other things that we have. Let's start with, the Google Home Mini. These things are so great because they're so small and they're compact and you can basically put them anywhere around the house and Walmart's Black Friday price for this is $19. That's amazing. This looks so great. I love these things. They're just so small so you can basically like put them anywhere in your house. I mean, obviously a lot of people know what this is but if you don't know, it just kind of looks like a little decoration. I love this thing. It's so great because it uses Google assistant so if you have any type of smart tech in your house you can basically use your voice to control your home. You could also play music and you can ask Google any types of questions regarding weather, you can make phone calls, all kinds of things and these fries smell so good. This is incredible. I'm cooking in my living room right now. Tala do you think this is something you could take with you camping if you have power? - [Tala] Yeah. - Next up. This is amazing. This is the Nintendo switch and this is $2.99. This is the Mario Cart Nintendo switch bundle. Obviously you guys know, I absolutely love Mario Kart. I've had Mario Cart parties. I even had Mario come to my house before. By far one of the most amazing things ever. So with this you get the Nintendo switch and you have the full game that can be downloaded. Ten minutes left on our fries. Ah, look at this. We've got the two Joy-Cons and this is actually the new Nintendo stitch and this comes with all of the accessories that you would need. By far one of my favorite accessory is, this turns your joy-cons into a little controller so you just pop them in there. Its also got the dock too. This is amazing. Pretty great Black Friday deal. The fries are almost done. They might need a shake, I gotta check on them. Seven minutes left. These I think are almost done. Oh this smells so good. Do we have any salt over here? - [Jenna] We do. - No added salt. What? I'm just gonna test one of them. - [Jenna] There's really no in between between sizes. - There really isn't. We're gonna just, okay let me test it. I think it actually might be done. Oh my god, they're done. They're definitely done. Let's check these fries. Oh these look great. - Jenna you better get hyped for fries. Fries are done. Let's add another dash of simple salt and let's try 'em. Okay, these are good. Jenna get over here, have some fries. - Do you know that french fries are my favorite? - Hey Google, who invented french fries? - [Google Assistant] Belgium, here's a summary from the website Wonderopolis.org. The origins of the french fry have been traced back to Belgium. To find out more look for the link in your google home or google assistant app. - Can we put some sweet potato fries in there? - We can put whatever we want in here. We can roast, we can reheat, we could bake, Jenna. - Can you put pizza in there? - It is four-in-one, you can put pizza on it because I saw. - That was not me. - I saw on the box they had a piece of pizza. - No way. - Yeah. - I guess I can leave now. (laughing) thank you, bye. - Okay, so, you guys can eat some more of these. - [Jenna] What? - So those french fries were incredible, uh, they were really great and I cannot wait to cook some more things in this. Now it is time to go out and test the hoverboard. Also, on TV again, this is a 198 dollars. This is a 4k Roku TV. I showcased this on Good Morning America and it was really great. Now, let's head outside. This is so much fun. I was actually pretty surprised how quick this is because, I just remember these being really not very fast but this has a nice speed to it. The balance feels really good. Oh, hoverboards, what a, they're so fun. Go-kart is all set up, I guess I'm gonna, I guess hop on it and figure this out. Okay, getting on the hover board, go-kart two-in-one. Okay, oh, this is actually way more fun, oh gosh. Okay this is way more fun than I thought it was gonna be. Oh my goodness, ah it's so fast, it's so fast. This is so fast, oh my gosh I can't control myself. Oh my goodness. I've always wanted to be the coolest kid at the park. Okay, I'm feeling really good like, look how talented I am. Okay so what I think I'm gonna do, there's a ramp over there, I'm gonna go launch off of it. Well, I'm not but oh my gosh. Okay, whoa whoa whoa I'm dizzy. This is amazing, it's amazing. I wanna find an off road. Yes I can, bye bye. Oh my gosh, oh god. (laughing) I think I need a whole fleet of these for all my friends. This was so much fun, I hope you guys enjoyed this video. I had the best time reviewing some Walmart's Black Friday deals. If you guys want more information be sure to check out Walmart.com for more of their Black Friday deals and I look forward to shopping Black Friday but right now I'm gonna go home, bye. Whoa.",

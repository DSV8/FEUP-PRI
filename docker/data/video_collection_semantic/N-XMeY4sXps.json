Because of the large cutout on the back, the new camera layout of the 7 Plus is unobstructed. Keep in mind this is completely unofficial, I simply bought the case after looking at pictures in hopes that it might work!

    "transcript": "Do you wanna get nuts? Come on! Let's get nuts. IPhone 7 and IPhone 7 Plus, You know about em'. They have been tough to avoid. But they are brand new and that means that the world of accessories for those products has not necessarily developed yet In the battery case, market place. Apple, they have their own. You know the hump back of Notre Dame. You saw it with the 6s, it's pretty much the same for the 7 but other manufacturers, they don't have their new versions yet. I bet, if I look around If I take a peek on amazon, I might find something that works. I recently switched over to the IPhone 7 plus. I got it right over here, you see like, with the matte black finish and what not. BUT I was like, every so often I like to slip a battery case on there Can you ever have enough juice? When your thirsty... ...in the desert? The absence of an actual battery case for the 7 Plus I started to snoop around And what I realized is that the vast majority of cases for the 6 and 6s Plus wouldn't work, on this one, because the camera cut-out wasn't suitable. Maybe, just maybe, there's a product on the market, that could accommodate the 7 Plus potentially an older 6s Plus or 6 product, with a bigger cut-out. Then I found this! The Moko... 4000 milli-amp hour battery case. Essentially, what you're looking at here is a case designed, for the 6 and 6s Plus with 4000 milli-amp hours of battery life. But the thing that caught my attention specifically with this one, Is the fact that it has a really large cut-out on it. can you see that!? 7 Plus, its got the totally different camera design This might be your go to! Now something to remember here, there are a few differences Not just in width here, but also in height. USB cable inside, 2 frames. It's got an audio jack with a- with a adaptor. Obviously not gonna need that on a- 7 Plus, but that shouldn't harm you at all. So here's the design here, soft touch kind of material, A battery indicator on the back. A lightening connector and you can see the speakers get re-routed here, so That's kind of a cool bonus because now your holding it like this. Of course as you know on the 7 Plus, you've got audio coming out of the ear-piece location now and the bottom ones will essentially re-fire this way, so now its like 2 forward facing speakers, that's an added bonus. And there's a different frame too, I don't know, maybe you wanna go clear on the front and black on the back So, the moment of truth. So that part comes off of the frame. This will slide in here, push it down, and MONEY IN THE BANK! As I suspected... fits in there, like a glove. fit the front part on here Doesn't really increase the thickness all that much. Buttons, work as you'd expect. Are we gonna get the nice charge? I'm gonna hold down the power button, 4 bars. If you look up in the top corner right there, its charging up. Just like that, 4000 extra milli-amp hours for the 7 Plus. No need to sit around and wait for third party manufacturers to put out ones that have 7 Plus on the title. Just pick up one of these designs, for the 6s Plus, and you're operational. Now I will say on the bottom here you still have this cut-out for the headphone, which obviously you will not be using. Now for sound, I wanna give you a quick test on that. *Music* I think that the audio actually get a nice little improvement here *Music* It's actually a little bit deeper. *Music* It's a nice little touch. So there you go, don't waste your time waiting around for a 7 Plus battery case. Pick up something like this and get moving straight away. If you're a power user, you want ultimate battery life, I got you covered. I did it so you don't have to. Links will be in the description. Thank you. Thank you?",

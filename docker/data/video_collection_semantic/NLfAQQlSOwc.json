    "transcript": "Samsung's Galaxy S line like their S10 S8 phones are very well known. They market them heavily especially in North America we see these things everywhere. They're A line up is not as well known and for the past couple of years their A line which is kind of their mid tier budget line has not been great. They have these mediocre phones and they've let chinese brands just dominate that market over the past little bit. But this year they brought something that feels legitimate and competitive in this market. These are the A20, A50 and A70 phones from Samsung so these phones have been available in Europe and Asia for the past month or so, maybe two months. Ah.. but they're finally coming into north america and the fact that they're bringing these into US and Canada is both interesting and somewhat telling as to how confident Samsung is about these phones in terms of how well they'll actually do how competitive they actually are in today's market so these are priced at 250 350 and about 550, maybe 570 US dollars I'm not able to get the exact US price on this because this one is not available in the US, the other two are. This I'm just converting from Canadian dollars to US, the A70 Now, at this price point for these exact prices, If I'm being honest, if you're getting a chinese branded phones like either a Huawei or a Xiaomi phone you're gonna get slightly faster processors for your money with the chinese phones. With these three Samsung phones you're getting a way better OLED panel you're getting cleaner software, a wide angled camera system and a brand name if that's important to you now these are missing some relatively important features such as things that they are missing that matter to me you don't get stereo speakers you don't get wireless charging and you don't get any kind of water resistance so there are phones out there that dont have an official IP rating like they are not officially certified for water resistance but they do have a degree of water resistance kind of built in to the phone manufacturing process there is seemingly none of that with these phones so when i pop out the sim tray there isn't even a rubber gasket on that. On devices like the Oneplus phones and the pixel 3a, even though these aren't officially IP certified, they're is a rubber gasket. So in the manufacturing process of these Samsung A series phones, they really didnt seem to care about water resistance now in terms of things they do have have on these phones now these are probably more important they have excellent OLED panels these are really nice looking screens for the price point they also have headphone jacks they have expandable storage they have big batteries and they also have a flat screen edge this is something I have talked about in some of my phone videos feel like some of the premium phone manufacturers out there put this curvature to the front display and it just dosen't really do anything functionally, if anything it impedes the display it just looks really pretty and I'm glad for a device like this they kept it flat so clearly these phones are made for real use. Not to look pretty in pictures of commercials but for real functionality now another feature all three of these share is a plastic back now I'll be honest for the first few days I used this I actually thought this was glass because it's got that glass shimmer it's got that glass glossiness to it but it is actually plastic while samsung calls it glasstic, but it's actually a plastic back with that plastic back this device scratches more easily and because it's got this shiny finish the scratches show but it's the right decision if you ever drop a plastic phone it's not gonna shatter it's not gonna spider this is the way to go and it makes it cheaper right I'm glad that they spent less money on the backing material and more money on the internals of they device where it actually matters plastic on a phone at this price is the way to go. The previous A series phones they had glass even at the $300-$400 price point it made no sense plastic was the right choice okay I'm not gonna do a review on all three of these phones the one that I like the most is the A50 it's the $350 unit so I'm gonna focus this conversation around this. This is $100 more than the A20 and you get a higher res screen, it's 1080p instead of the 720p on the A20 you get a zoom lens on the camera you get an in display fingerprint sensor which works surprisingly well for a $350 phone it's not super fast like you do have to get used to it's speed and you also have to get used to the positioning of your thumb when you place it on the screen but once you used to it, it works well and it's features like this that make this phone stick out for me it's not like a flagship killer, now clearly that's not what they are going for they do not wanna cannibalize the sales of their actual flagship phones but they're bringing features like this in display fingerprint sensor and just a solid overall phone experience at a $350 price point, it's awesome. But you should be aware of I guess two big differences between these three phones and the more expensive flagship phones so I;ll just go over the two the big one is performance these three phones are not running the fastest SoCs out there the A50 and A70 are running more mid tier stuff the A20 is running more entry level stuff it's still offers great value for the money at 250 dollars but if you're looking for kind of like a snappy experience and I kind of feel a lot of audience is I wouldn't go for this one it's not so much the in app performance or even the UI it's more about switching between apps. With only three gigs of RAM this is a more limited experience the A50 is a lot better with the faster processor and 4 gigs of RAM but I still did notice some pretty aggressive app closures and I do think it's a matter of RAM management, Samsung's never been awesome at it I really wish I was getting better performance with this phone because of it's price point but that's what we have if you're just using your phone in a more, I guess like a more simple manner like you're not switching between 5 or 6 apps frequently then you probably wont even notice it but for the people that are used to multitasking and want to multitask then you will notice a difference in performance between this and something with more RAM and the six gigs of RAM in the A70 delivers a more smoother experience but it is a lot more expensive so you kind of expect that now the other feature that is similar between these three phones and different from all the other flagship phones out there is the camera system and traditionally Samsung's mid tier phone line up has usually been packed with poor cameras and this years cameras are good but they're not great. I wish I could say they were great but i can't because of the existence of the pixel 3a and the pixel 3a XL this phone's camera is just so much better than these three and it;s like similar in price so it's hard to, it''s hard to call these things anything better than good if you're taking shots in good lighting conditions or outdoors it's fine there's some over exposure and sometimes focusing has some issues but I'm happy with it it's the low light photos that it has troubles with it over exposes some of the lights and it just struggles but to be honest I'm content with these cameras like for the money just I'm not gonna complain right and I'm not looking for the best camera if i was I'd be picking up the pixel 3a, the pixel 3a XL for this price point but you're getting a really good phone experience overall with the A series and as I use these phones for the past little bit it just made me realize that like I remember Marques a few years ago saying good phones are getting cheap, cheap phones are getting good and this to me is like this is clearly a really cheap phone that is great. It's pressure from the consumer market and it's pressure from the chinese manufacturers that have shaped these phones to be what they are to be as good as they are for as little as they cost if you are interested in an inexpensive phone I highly recommend checking out these A series phones they surprise me like I have never loved the older ones but these phones are fantastic okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time",

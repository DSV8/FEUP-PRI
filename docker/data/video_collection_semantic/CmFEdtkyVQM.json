    "transcript": "Been wanting to tell you about this for a long time this is a Raspberry Pi 5. the newest Raspberry Pi from the Raspberry Pi Foundation. I first saw one of these in April of this year when I spoke to Eben Upton he explained the differences between a Raspberry Pi 5 and a Raspberry Pi 4 and what makes this so much better. So this is Raspberry Pi 5 it's the next generation of the Raspberry Pi SBC Single Board Computer product line it's a pretty familiar looking object it's it's another credit card size computer for fun you'll notice Ethernet connect to move back to where it used to be you know one of the things that happened with Raspberry Pi 4 was the Ethernet connector moved over there it's moved back down there but you know notable things and almost completely new core chip set. So we have a new power supply, um we have a new power supply chip, we have a new piece of core silicon from ProCom and then for the first time you'll see we've got a chip on here which uh it's another it's another product with two Raspberry Pi logos unlike Raspberry Pi Pico it has for the first time it's a big Raspberry Pi product on which one of the pieces of silicon was developed here at Raspberry Pi. Uh this is a this is a device that we call RP1 and it's the I/O controller so it's the thing that provides the USB, provides the Ethernet, now provides the um the camera and display interfaces the maybe camera and display interfaces historically those were integrated onto the main SSC. What's happened on this platform is that a lot of those I/O interfaces which were previously integrated into the core silicon have now moved off onto RP1 so the GPIOs are provided by a by RP1 not by the core silicon. Now um RP1 is connected to the um main SCC it's another program SSC called 2712 it's connected to the main SCC by a four lane PCR Express Gen 2 Link so fairly a fairly beefy link we can tunnel all of that camera and do all of that real-time critical display and Camera information and the non-real-time critical but still very high bandwidth USB 2, USB 3 and gigabit Ethernet uh traffic over there it's a 16 gigabit link so it's a good one it's a good bit of bandwidth there and you can see you see here on the board all these these um this vast number of parallel wires so that's the um that's the PCI Express Bus between the two chips. CPU while CPU quad core um quad XA76 right um LPDDR4X between four and eight uh we have I I believe that we are likely to have choices of four and eight gig probably not determined at this point so I think things that are not determined at this point exactly what the launch RAM variants are going to be probably four and eight uh exactly what the clock speed of the A76 is it's going to be probably north of two gigahertz um you're looking at the level of performance which is a little over twice that of a Raspberry Pi 4. Fantastic. I've been really impressed with the Raspberry Pi 5. It's so much faster in my tests than a Raspberry Pi 4. Eben explains some of the differences between these two but I've also had the chance to test the Raspberry Pi 5 and see how much quicker it is than a Raspberry Pi 4. please note that this video is not sponsored by Raspberry Pi they did however send me this Raspberry Pi a keyboard and some other devices so that I could test the newest Raspberry Pi from the Raspberry Pi Foundation. One fun thing if you look at I look at a couple of other products that have had Raspberry Pi logos on the tops of chips uh Pico has RP2040 on uh you'll see on the top of that chip it says RP2 there's a general consensus that RP2 must stand for RP2040 it doesn't um if you look at Zero 2 W that has the um a SiP on there a system in package which integrates a Broadcom uh application processor die with um some DRAM some Micron DRAM that's RP3 on top of it I'm not sure what the consensus is about that somehow that refers to Raspberry Pi 3 because of course it has the same Broadcom silicon and there's Raspberry Pi 3 this piece of silicon says RP1 on top of it no one's ever asked us well RP1 and once ever gone RP2 RP3 what's RP1 so explain it to us this is RP1 it's just the order in which the programs were started this is the oldest Raspberry Pi silicon Engineering program this is this program has been running since um in one form or another since the summer of 2015. oh right so this is an eight yeah yeah so that the I/O controller is an eight year program have some false starts but it's an eight year program I choose to get to that. Eight years to get to that and I'm assuming quite a bit of money. A fair bit of money you know suddenly worth of 10 million dollars to uh to develop uh to develop RP1 that's amazing yeah it's cool so yeah so so Custom PMIC uh new welcome silicon in-house developed I/O controller uh off the shelf uh LPDDR4X memory um off the shelf um it's got the same the 43455 uh Dual Band Wi-Fi and Bluetooth combo the same one that we use in Raspberry Pi 3 plus and Raspberry Pi 4 so that's really the only thing that's not the same across all the recent generations of the platform. Eben what's the biggest difference between say this and the 4? Oh performance um so um you have a lot more CPU performance and also two times the CPU performance less headline performance metrics have inched up so this is a dual 4Kp60 platform where the previous platform was a dual 4Kp30 platform um GPU performance has edged up much more than Edge up GPU performance has gone up quite substantially on this platform. uh USB performance has gone up on this platform, so where the previous design had a pair of USB 3s and a pair of USB 2s that were connected over a four a four gigabit link uh we have um a pair of in and they were hubbed so effectively you have a you have four gigabits then you have a USB controller and a an integral Hub um uh so you see your maximum you're gonna you have two five gigabit USB ports but the maximum bandwidth you can get throttled by the 4 gigabit Upstream in this design you have two independent USB controllers uh connected so you get five gigabits out of each one and the Upstream throttle is at 16 gigabits um now shared with camera and display and Giga and ethernet but in practice you're much more likely to be able to get your peak USB 3 bandwidth out of the system so they've been some of these subsidiary performance metrics that have inched up um yeah but by and large it's all about the CPU. It's amazing how you've been able to keep prices so low and yet ramp up the performance. Yeah we worked really hard too um obviously you know historically we had this we've had this $35 price bond um you know we worked really hard particularly in the context of the um the shortage any situation and everything absolutely you know $35 in 2012 it's not $35 today um obviously the shortage brought within a lot of cost increase we're absorb most of that so you know if you look at what we've it I think the sum total of our price increases with the shortage environment we moved zero up to a more sustainable price point so we moved to five and ten dollar products to ten or fifteen dollars that's a you know a $5 increase but obviously a fairly large proportional increase. Um we moved on the compute module four um products up by $5 uh and then we moved um two gigabyte Raspberry Pi 4 back to $45 we'd actually just brought it down from 45 to 35 when everything kicked off um so we we unwound that so we discontinued the one gig at 35 brought the two gig down from 45 and then about a year ago we moved the 2gig back up to 45 and then we reintroduced the one gig so people still do have a $35 uh product in the Pi 4 generation. Now to really test the CPUs of these two Raspberry Pi's I'm going to use an application called hashcat, hashcad allows you to crack passwords or hashes of passwords and it hammers the CPU in other words it drives the CPU hard or in most cases in the real world we'd use GPUs to do password cracking but this gives us a nice example of testing how good the CPU is of a Raspberry Pi 4 versus a Raspberry Pi 5 and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at how good the Raspberry Pi 5 is. To install this application you'd use the command sudo apt install hashcat so I've done that on both of these devices already so I can use the command hashcat -b to run a baseline on both of them. So what I'm going to do now is press enter at the same time and I just used a basic command of hashcat -b to get a baseline so on the Raspberry Pi 5 we've got 77219 kilohashes per second on the Raspberry Pi 4 we've got 34000 kilohashes per second in other words thousand hashes per second that's for MD5 for SHA1 on the Raspberry Pi 5 we've got 57000 Raspberry Pi 4 we've got 26000 so as you can see we're getting at least a double the hashes. So if I run that again and I'll just speed this up so that we can see some other options at this point we've already got shot to 256 still trying to calculate it on the Raspberry Pi 4 and I'll stop the Raspberry Pi 5 at thispoint because we've got 127 million hashes a second for NTLM hashes on the Raspberry Pi 5 takes a while for the Raspberry Pi 4 to catch up one eternity later. So as you can see here for NTLM hashes we've got 58000 kilohashes per second whereas with the Raspberry Pi 5 we've got 127 million hashes a second. Now another application you can use is sysbench you install it bytyping sudo apt install sysbench I'm running it on both the Raspberry Pi 5 and Raspberry Pi 4, in this example I'm going to use four threads with prime number of twenty thousand let's see the difference between the two of them so I'll press enter on both the Raspberry Pi's as you can see prime numbers limit is 20000 the threads have been started on both theRaspberry Pi's and there you go so the Raspberry Pi 5 was slightly quicker but notice the events per second 4000 whereas on the Raspberry Pi 4 it's 2800 average here on Raspberry Pi 4 is 1.42 average on a Raspberry Pi 5 is 0.96 I personally prefer the the hashcat example I think that shows it a lot clearer the output on Raspberry Pi 5 is just so much quicker in my general tests I found that the Raspberry Pi 5 is a lot more responsive compared to Raspberry Pi 4. It's so much better in my tests it's been a very long journey one of the interesting things about Raspberry Pi is what you see from us is the organization grows over time and the programs take a long time to develop. What you see from us at any given time was developed by much smaller Engineering team than the Engineering team now so you know you may wonder what all these Engineers have been doing for the last few years and by and large the answer is this thing here and then it's just exciting to see the light of day um you know it's an amazing Engineering team um you know to be able to build you know this is a RP1 is a vastly more you know, I love RP2, I love RP2040 um but RP1 is a vastly more complicated uh piece of silicon than RP2040 and it's just been amazing to watch the team over the years put that product together, define it, implement it, iterate it stabilize it and make something which we really think is going to be an important part of future Raspberry Pi platforms. Are you it sounds like you're getting the same route as another fruit company where you're doing more and more of your own silicon and you see that's where the future is going? I definitely think you know you're likely to certainly see more from us in the um I think it's important to draw a draw a distinction between um I/O controller silicon and microcontroller silicon on the one hand and then core silicon on the other hand you know this is another 40 nanometer this is another 40 nanometer uh device um the the core silicon can hear the broadcast core silicon here is a 16 nanometer device there's a huge difference between building these big designs on 16 and building um even fairly complicated designs on on 40. So I think you'll see more I mean you might see more in micro the microcontroller space you might see future iterations of this um of this of this design but I think this partition where we where we do the the Raspberry Pi specific Engineering ourselves but continue to work with Merchant Farmers for the for the what we call fast digits for the core silicon is a pretty good model for us. Great to see an update from the Raspberry Pi Foundation, great to see a new single board computer from them after all of these years I think a lot of us have been waiting for it Eben has already explained some of the differences in the architecture and so forth they look very very similar but huge performance increase in the Raspberry Pi 5. I'm hoping to create many more videos talking about the Raspberry Pi 5 showing you how to use it in various applications let me know in the comments below the kind of stuff that you want to see great to see this new single board computer [Music] thank you [Music]",

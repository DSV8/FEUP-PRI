    "transcript": "- I don't know quite when this happened, but Sony's over the ear Wireless headphones went from only for those who are in the know to mainstream contenders against the Air Pods Max and the Bose Quiet Comfort Series seemingly overnight. And this latest iteration looks extremely promising. This, my friends, is the WH1000 XM5, and I can already tell you from the carrying case by the way, eco-friendly packaging, thank you very much, that this is meant to be one trendy mother fucker of a headphone. Whoa, that's a cool color. I don't know why I was expecting white from the box. Well maybe because their box is a completely different color from the headphones. That might be part of the reason for it. But I actually really like this. It's like stone and it's really amazing how close they've gotten the color with all of these different materials. Naturally, my notes don't include anything about what it's actually made of. Is this leather? This feels like a fake leather. In terms of accessories, we get a USB A to C cable. A really rinky dinky one. And... (caveman noises) It's it's a caveman cable. Get it? Because it's free. Me like cable. Make fire. I'm kidding. Cable's good. It's good for quality. But obviously most people are gonna be using a headphone like this with, you know, Bluetooth. In terms of interface. there's a whopping eight microphones on this puppy and I am excited to try and find them. Looks like we've got a couple here and here. These are almost definitely mics. And then what, are these larger slits? The other three mics on each ear cup? That's double the quantity that we saw on the previous generation. And their noise canceling processors have apparently also been doubled. I'm not a hundred percent sure why that ends up being a talking point because one more powerful processor would've been also fine, but they felt the need to tell us that there are now two. I'm gonna take off my two, excuse me, beanie, LTTstore.com, just so that I can experience the comfort. They've actually managed to shave a few grams off the weight of the XM force. So they're a pretty actually a very comfortable about 250 grams. And in spite of the fact that they've got a narrower headband, which I, in the past, I have not been a fan of, the cushioning on it is extremely thick. To the point where this might not actually be a problem. It's also a nice dense foam. Really like to see that. Shout out Sony, by the way, for having clearly indicated right and left markers. Like I'm smart enough to figure out from muscle memory which side my headphones go on, but it's just convenient. You hand them to someone else and they're not like fumbling around with them looking for a tiny little end bus or L somewhere. I love it. Other changes over last gen include automatic noise cancellation optimization. You now get three hours of playback off of just a three minute charge, which is pretty cool. And there's now four beam forming microphones for phone calls, as opposed to the last gen just says NA, and Sony's talking points. Although I'm sure they had microphones on them. It's quite possible that there are noise cancellation microphones on the inside of the ear cup. In fact, that's very likely, that's one of the ways that they can actually listen to the world around you as your ears would hear it in order to cancel out exactly what would make its way into your ear. So it's quite probable then that the microphones I was playing out before are the bean forming ones for phone calls and all of the noise canceling ones are on the inside. And or some of these are dual purpose. We've got a button here to change between noise cancellation and ambient mode. We've also got a power button. Might as well power this puppy up. Three and a half millimeter jack, and then over on the other side, type C for charging. And that's about it in terms of adjustment. Well, I wouldn't describe this as a super broad adjustment range, but I guess it's okay. I mean, if I had a significantly larger noggin I'd still be able to make this work, but you know you wouldn't go much smaller than me, then again I wear a small sized motorcycle helmet. So my head is on the smaller size. At least literally. I'm gonna give it a little one of these. Just calm down, calm down. I'm just trying to get it contoured to my head a little better. There's nothing wrong with adjusting. Is that on right out of the gate? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you. I can't tell what it's doing right now. Time to get it paired to the app. That's for sure. - There's a knife for protection and look on there other side. - Is this warm? What is this? Caution live scorpions. I don't really understand what I'm looking at here. It certainly isn't scorpions. Oh, it stinks. This is huge. How the hell am I supposed to... Where am I supposed to put this? I, I guess I might as well make my way through some talking points. Dbrand, they make overpriced stickers for your electronics, and they sent this puzzle. You can put stickers on your phone. You can put stickers on your laptop. You can put stickers on your game console and controllers. You can, oh, it smells. Awe, did you smell this? Can you smell it from there? Oh my gosh. It's like a, like a discomforting kind of smell. Okay, it's an outline so that you basically cannot screw up putting together the puzzle. I don't get it. Do they do puzzles now? What are they, scorpions? Scorpions in the puzzle. I don't think so. I think it's just that cool art style that they really like. Is it art? Is it? Do you... Is it a cape? Yeah, I don't get it. What, what is it? I don't get it. Visit dbrand.com/shortlinus. Enter the code 4footnine to get 15% off. Unless the video has been up for more than 15 minutes. In which case the deal is over. Oh good. They're gonna steal my video retention. Perfect, you better come back to the video. Turn on the power that I'm gonna... Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You can see little Bluetooth lights flashing. Oh wow. That's fun. My computer just grabbed it. Show notifications to connect using swift pair. Connect to supported Bluetooth devices quickly when they're close by in pairing mode. That's pretty cool. I've never seen that. There it is. Sign in and get started. Haha. Go to the dashboard. Okay, so they want you to use... Okay, well that's neat. I'm not gonna do that right now. To use them comfortably, check out the tutorial. Ooh, ooh. Touch sensor control panel. Double tap for play and pause. - But for that new matter. - Oh, John was watching some MKB HD. One tap to receive a call, finish call. Swipe forward. Oh, I like the audio feedback. It gives you a little dun dun, if I go too fast, it just doesn't wanna do it. Hmm, it still makes the noise. You should never make a noise registering input if you're not gonna actually register the input. Bad, bad UI. Listening to ambient sound quickly. Quick attention mode. Ooh, I like it. Okay, oh, that is not a very good ambient mode. - What? - Oh, interesting. - Can you hear me? - Yeah, I can hear you, you're fine. Like you're completely fine, but my own voice sounds like it's coming from... Wow I really don't know how to describe this. It's like, okay. What it is is it's when you hear a character's inner monologue on a TV show. So they're sitting in class and it's like and that was the moment that I realized that I had fallen in love with my ninth grade math teacher. - Yeah - Like, like that's what my own voice sounds like to me. It's very annoying. - Why is that where you went? - Everyone else sounds fine but it's very annoying. I mean, it's the kind of thing you'll get used to but I wish it was better. - Do you think they'll just like fix the noise? - The noise cancellation is excellent though. I didn't hear a word of that. I turned it back on. Sorry about that. Go ahead. - Do you think they'll fix it with software? - You know what? I don't, I don't take anything for granted. Maybe they'll fix it. Maybe they won't. But I can only evaluate what's in front of me. Now, I do wanna try out the quick ambient noise thing. If I hold my hand here it doesn't does not seem to be doing that but what are you doing? What are you doing? - I thought you're doing noise canceling. - It's not working. I'd be able to tell very easily. Credit though. The, the, the pressure the pressure sound of the noise cancellation. Basically non-existent, really cool. Your speak to chat is enabled in the dashboard. If you talk the headset pauses your mute to music being played... It'd be kind of neat if it just lowered it actually. I am using speech to chat right now. And go ahead. We can have a conversation. - Hi Linus, could you pull the phone closer to you? - You want me to pull the phone closer to me? Yes, I'd be happy to do that. Thank you, Andy. Let's see how long it takes to stop. That's a long time. Wow, okay. And then as soon as I open my mouth, it opens up the ambient sound again. Yeah, I don't know if I'm a huge fan of that. Ooh, they have EQ though. Can I customize the EQ? Show me custom. Show me custom. If you don't have custom you suck. They don't have custom. Oh, manual, manual. Wait, custom. What's the difference between manual and custom? Hey, there we go. Not the world's most amazing EQ, but it's better than nothing, which is what some headphones have. It needs more bars, more bars, Sony, stop. I can never figure out what to listen to. Screw it. I'm going with In Canto soundtrack. America, impress me with your carbon fiber drivers, Sony. That's right. Carbon fiber. Light is good, right? Because it gives you increased response. Well, they're not flat, but they're not overdone. How much were the IE 600s? - 700 US. - 700 US. Okay, well then that's not a fair comparison, but they really don't have a very analytical sound. This is a very normy sound signature, to Sony's credit. It's not all, it's not all base. You know, it's not like a, a early 2010s beats kind of sound. It's not muddy. It's like for your aunt who wants her sound to sound like rich and full, but it's not precise. All right. Hit me with something. What should I listen to? - Crab Rave. - Crab rave. Man, now that I've heard the IE 600s, I'm just not gonna be able to be fair to anything else. To be clear, these sound really good. Really, hello? How many attempts is it gonna take to pause this music? All it's doing is stuttering the playback. Okay, is it gonna pause when I put it around my neck? Yes, oh, they're comfortable around the neck. So the ear cups can rotate either this much this way, or this much, this way. You'll probably end up wearing them like this. And actually it's kind of tight in the neck. I don't even have a super thick neck. So it might be something to watch out for. It's not bad though. I do love the weight. I do love the comfort. They auto resume when you pull them onto your head, which I would expect at this price point, you can EQ out a lot of my complaints. I would take these over the Air Pods Max, for sure, with no question. Just the comfort alone. It's not even a question. - They are cheaper, too. - I don't even know how much the Air Pods Max are. It almost doesn't matter because they're just kind of dumb. Why would you want heavy headphones? I think we're done here. See you later. Oh, subscribe.",

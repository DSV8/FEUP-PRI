    "transcript": "for today's video we're going to follow the gradual process of me turning into a caveman but before we get into that we're going to upgrade the samsung all-in-one now today's video is going to be more like a like an interim max performance mod because in typical david fashion some things went wrong that i didn't quite anticipate so while we wait for some more adapters to show up from far away lands we're just gonna do the max performance we can get out of the closed unit because the one that we have standing here is significantly more powerful than the stock version so with that let's rip it open and follow the upgrade process and then we'll compare pre caveman to post caveman gaming performance [Music] the first step is to use the little memory glory hole on the back to upgrade the ram [Music] we're gonna go from a two and a four gig stick to two eight gig sticks giving us 10 gigs more ram wow it's amazing how much easier it is to get the back off once you've popped the virginity now while i'm under here i'm also going to swap the hard drive out for an ssd because that's going to be way [Music] faster i'm gonna use this old samsung 840 evo which is actually the first ssd i ever bought and it still works perfectly [Music] the next step is replacing the cpu going from a 3470t to a 3770 which not only has four more threads running at a much faster speed but it also replaces that terrible eye gpu in the 3470t with something slightly less terrible weirdly the 3770 that i bought off ebay was actually vandalized somebody scratched a bunch of gusta into it i don't know if it should be impressed by the precision or outraged by the vandalism [Music] [Music] okay so i'm going to put the cooler back on i'm not entirely convinced that this cooling system is going to be able to handle the 3770 uh but we'll see how it goes you know this is experimentation i'm sure we can figure something out if it doesn't [Music] okay let's see if it works with the new cpu and the new ssd hey okay so uh we just need to install windows on here again but it works so the cpu that's been vandalized has has not been killed at least uh so with that i'm going to install windows on it so this is running with the upgraded setup we're practicing with bots so bear that in mind but the performance already feels way better it's at the same settings and you know it's still not something i'd use to play against other people with but it's not bad one thing that is clear though is that we've got a much bigger thermal load on the on the cooling solution we have about 74 degrees celsius on the cpu but it's still boosting to about 3.8 gigahertz so that's not bad i think yeah i think the benchmarks are going to be are going to be way better so let's see how it compares [Music] after all of that we doubled our gaming performance taking it from completely unplayable to just plain terrible which is you know that's that's a little bit better i guess i didn't have more gaming benchmarks because well quite frankly the stock configuration can't really play many games well enough to get a reasonable benchmarking result uh so that's why we only had these three games looking at gta running side by side on the two configurations you can see that 100 performance uplift in all its glory although with the max performance mod we're still struggling to get 24 frames per second and bear in mind that that's at 720p so yeah that's pretty horrendous another interesting thing to look at is the temperatures we're getting about 80 degrees celsius with that 3770 and that's with the cpu utilization of about 25 that means if we do ever get like an external gpu going and that cpu utilization increases it's gonna get hotter than a taco bell toilet run real fast although when it comes to cinebench r20 the temperatures were in the low 80s which isn't too bad and obviously the score is significantly higher than the previous version and then finally the reason that we don't have the max performance upgrade is because david was a bit of a dum-dum and bought the wrong adapters and stuff so if you look on the back of the all-in-ones motherboard you'll see that there's a wi-fi card that uses what looks at a glance like an m.2 slot so i bought this awesome looking adapter which is really cool it's like an m.2 to pci express adapter that actually has supplemental power for the graphics card and stuff it's i'm pretty excited to use that but the problem was the moment that i removed the actual wifi card i realized that it wasn't an m.2 slot it was a mini pcie slot which is good it means it uses pcie lanes so it should be able to communicate with a graphics card but it's not m.2 now luckily there are m.2 to pcie mini adapters and i bought one of those but the one that i bought had to be modified to fit in and once it fit in the actual m.2 cable while that wouldn't fit because of the positioning of the connector on the motherboard so i've now ordered like a ribbon cable adapter which will probably work even though there is this space constraint but it's gonna take ages to get here so i'm just gonna wait for that now i know that using a mini pcie to m.2 adapter to adapt a graphics card to work with the system is gonna be a bottleneck akin to shivving the graphics card and the balls but that's okay i i'm just hopeful that it'll at least work hopefully we'll get better performance than the integrated graphics on on the 3d 70. so with that thank you very much for watching if you like the sound of what is about to happen and is potentially going to be a failure like and subscribe to the channel for that video and until the next video bye you",

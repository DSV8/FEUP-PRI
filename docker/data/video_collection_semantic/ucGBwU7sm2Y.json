    "transcript": "what is up everyone, a very special video you saw the title of this game will absolutely annihilate your CPU. doesn't matter what cpu have you can always push this game to your cpu's limit so i encourage you to check this game out at least it atleast rent the thing or you know buy it for what's 24 hours or so. I don't know steam still doing that where you can just test a game out and if you really like you can keep it if you don't like it you can get your money back but I do encourage you to check this game out. This isn't something that they're sponsoring or anything like that. this is just me wanting to show you a very cool game that I find very interesting you know we've talked about astronomy on the channel several times in this game is just right up my alley I love it you can pretty much manipulate anything you want in the solar system and that's what's super cool about it I mean it sounds kind of dumb on paper but if you think about it okay so we got we have earth here let's not even do earth that's just too generic so you double click on Jupiter we can zoom in now this is one of the cool features of this game here game whatever you want to call it simulator you can control the speed the rate at which time progresses and that's via this toolbar down here at the bottom so let's say I want time to just absolutely fly by so I can speed it up to where were what are we at right now we're at four months per every second of real time so right now you're looking at this is four months every second so of course the planet's rotating very fast and we can actually see it progress around the Sun you can see everything else it's closer to the Sun is moving much faster because that's how physics works but let's focus on Jupiter for a second here so one of the ways that we can really stress the CP let's go ahead and go to the add tab now we can add I mean all this stuff here that's pre-loaded we can add any of this into the solar system including stars by the way if you're interested in something some kind of binary system like the tattooing planet in star wars but let's try to get the earth orbiting around Jupiter I don't know how far we're going to want this thing to start but I assume that at some point the earth will just steadily rotate around Jupiter and you can see there are little paths that that kind of project from the planet that we're about to spawn and they kind of spin out so that's the computer the simulator actually predicting the planets path based on gravitational influences this is where ties into this game being very accurate so let's say I throw the planet let's do it fairly close you actually see the shadow of the earth on Jupiter as well it's very cool let's do it right here okay so there goes it's just spinning off in the distance course earth is drastically cooling because it's so much further from the Sun than it normally is so surface temperatures see that one degree Celsius now here here's what's also very cool so we can click on the earth and you'll see if it as our surface temperature declines the actual features of the planet will also change okay so there you go now you can kind of see it's just more looks more hazy i guess but this is the earth frozen over and it's very cold right now average surface temperature is negative 37 degrees Celsius Jupiter is still very hot for reasons I cannot explain I guess when it got too close to it just warmed up somehow and I can explain that but we do have the earth in orbit around Jupiter that was our goal in the first place and what we're going to do is speed up this simulation I want you to pay attention to the CPU usage I have right here I know it says ram usage below that but this is CPU usage that you're looking at so right now overall CP usage is around forty forty percent or so and that's just us focusing on these two bodies right here we're not even looking at the entire solar system all the other planets and stuff are back there this also has asteroids included in it comets all kinds of stuff even a dwarf planets like ceries and Pluto way out in the distance so I want you to watch the CPU usage as I do this I'm coming down to the bottom here and I'm going to increase the rate at which time progresses okay so now we're at a couple days per second there we go oh there it goes so we're at a few months per second now cpu usage is increased from forty percent to almost seventy percent and i don't know if you notice this but if we include all the other bodies in the frame that we're currently having rendered then you can see that the CPU usage will actually increase even more so let's just focus on jupiter will look down that actually increased CPU usage for a second there but our CPU usage to declines because now the only thing the CPU is having to do is calculate Earth's position with respect to Jupiter's with respect to the sun's it's not really worried about rendering the other stuff even though the CPU is worried about physics in general where things are going to be in the next frame or two let's slow things back down and of course CPU usage dramatically declines so that's one way that you can heavily stress your CPU in this game it's just by speeding up time that is something that I mean makes sense you're having your CPU work much faster and your GPU mind you but this game is much more CPU intensive than you than you might think so let's take Earth and let's do something crazy let's double click or sorry right click on it and all right so we can change all of these characteristics over here we can change the the velocity of its orbit we can change its rotational velocity all kinds of different things right let's change the surface temperature first let's raise it to 500 degrees Celsius and boom there goes all the water you see it's just dissolving that's actually really cool oh there goes the oceans now the one thing that is really going to influence how the other planets react and how the Sun reacts to the earth that's really cool there is all the water vapor we're going to increase the Earth's mass by a metric crapton so let's say instead of one earth mass for one earth mass which is what it actually is in real life let's raise it to 500 Earth's I've got a lot bigger so with respect to Jupiter now its saying that we're 1.57 times the mass of Jupiter let's see let's keep going let's do 500 Jupiter's Oh earth got super big what is that it's like a star now you can see here we're speeding things up and the planets are being heavily influenced now by the earth to mars is just going crazy so the earth is swinging around now this is this is what i'm getting at you'll see this here shortly what we're going to do is increase the mass of the earth again to let's say fifty thousand i'm going to pay attention to what happens to the earth when we do this going to slow it up and so 50000 suns okay we just we just created a star essentially that's pretty crazy so this star has a ton of mass look at that look at our CPU usage whoa whoa whoa okay supernova remnant that is a black hole we just created a supernova in our solar system well there goes the old old earth or whatever was left of it okay I fix it so now you can justly cpu usage on top you see when the supernova occurred we were at almost one more we were at one hundred percent cpu usage so at that point we just maxed out cpu just couldn't it couldn't calculate anything more than what it was already doing we basically topped it off and that's kind of the I mean that's the gist of this video you can do so much with this and I haven't even I mean I haven't gone to great lengths to make this cpu just absolutely crap itself but you certainly could do that let's just end with that so let's take let's take a star let's take BG check out how hard to be able to use this compared to everything else in the solar system that is super cool so if we simply speed up the simulation cpu usage definitely increases we have that variable under control look out fast we can make this thing work like we can keep picking it up for that eighty percent overall cpu usage there and it's fairly stable too and if we increase it even more how many years read this is 23 years per second being calculated we had a hundred and thirty-seven years actually inducing some lag at this point yep it's definitely definitely not liking it but another way i like to personally overload my CPU with respect to this game is to open up a very special simulation I like to do Saturn with the Rings this is just a chaotic nightmare look at everything orbiting just Saturn and this is you know this isn't our solar system this is just one one planetary system how much stuff we have there so we can get really fancy with this so everything's you know nice and tidy it looks all great right now orbits are very controlled and stable we're going to really mess this thing up let's just throw an earth somewhere into the mix let's do it right there let's do another one and another one that sounds good maybe another let's just you know what it's just the roll em all over the place that sounds good to me and we're going to watch is these earth which aren't even rotating on the same axis the same axial plane that all the other things are on Saturn up we had one collision there it is zoom in on it what's the temperature of Earth right now well 2400 degrees Celsius that's pretty hot ok we a lot of collisions Saturn is also heated up to 2,700 degrees Celsius so we're going to focus on Saturn here for a second and then while all this mess happens we're going to also speed up time there it goes now this is actually very smooth here we're not seeing any frame stuttering any skipping any stall that it actually looks great but the CPU is being heavily leveraged right now in the upper 70s we increase the speed even more look at that ninety percent and it's not the smoothness at this point cpu is definitely being used more than I'm comfortable with I don't know let's throw in a star let's do the Sun let's just pretend the Sun is I don't know right there okay and let's watch as everything just just gets pulled right in there it all goes see the simulation maps out every possible scenario and predicts where things will be at any particular second especially way into the future which is why the CPU is being so heavily leveraged whoa that is a super cool super nova I had this game linked in the video description by the way if you're interested in pushing your CPU to its limit this is the game to do that with if you like this video be sure to give it a thumbs up thumbs down for the opposite quickly subscribe if you haven't already and I will catch you in the next video this is salazar studio thanks for destroying with us",

    "transcript": "Grr... Sometimes I just, I get tired of the go, go, go lifestyle. I just want to get comfortable, put on an old hat, grab some big league chew and move on down to Bratislava with a truckload of widgets. Or should I say, moza on down since they paid the bills for this sick trucking rig. And I know what you're thinking. Euro truck simulator? Really? But at the time of filming, this 12 year old game was ranked number 26 on Steam by active player count. And you know what? I want to see what all the fuss is about. So join me as we trade our high octane gasoline for diesel and hit the open road. The R3 Racing Bundle from Moza is their first officially licensed Xbox set. You get this aluminum alloy steering wheel with a direct drive wheel base, steel gas and brake pedals, and a desk clamp. Of course, the main attraction for us is the ability to customize it, both in software with their mobile and PC apps and in hardware with their expansive ecosystem of SIM goodies. Of course, we can't really get to any of that until we have a base to build around. And for that, we've chosen the GT Elite Lite Wheel Plate Edition from Next Level Racing. We wanted something that was easy to use, reasonably lightweight, but sturdy and adaptable. It's made of aluminum extrusion and just want to shout out Next Level Racing who were like \"We got you, fam!\" when we asked them to send this over. This is gonna be a really good starting point for us. Some assembly is definitely required, but at least we get to skip a couple of steps because we won't need the adjustable pedal mount that changes the angle here since we want a more upright, flat trucker seating profile. Question for you guys, is there a reason this is dirty as all heck? Yeah, I was living in labs for a couple weeks while I was testing everything out and between me using it and everyone else It kind of got a little dirty. Ah, okay. Well, that's a good sign when it's fun enough that it's not clean anymore for its big day. Now the keen-eyed among you probably noticed that the R3 bundle we said we were using doesn't have a clutch pedal But ours does that's because adding on to our r3 is as simple as grabbing one of these srp clutch pedals moving everything over and you're off to the races or Deliveries as it were all three of our pedals feature high-precision hall effect sensors and on top of changing the layout you can change the Configuration adjusting the output curves of the pedals in their software since we were down here by the way We also added their moza performance kit to the brake pedal. I mean don't get me wrong They're good out of the box, but this gives the brake a bit more of a realistic Progressive resistance we're gonna have links to all this stuff in the description by the way Now it's time to mount our wheelbase to our shelf the R3 base offers 3.9 Newton meters of torque and has broad compatibility on PC with presets for many of your favorite Xbox racing and Sim games wouldn't mind it if more than two of the screws fit the cheese plate But seems like it's on there pretty good, right? That's not going anywhere. Oh, yeah, it's not going anywhere now Normally you'd mount this really at any height you want but you'd aim to have it around level with the ground but for us We're gonna tilt it a little bit back to get more of an authentic big rig feel. What are you guys thinking for height? When I was testing? I had a straight 90 vertical. What? Shut up. Not even joking. Okay, I'm super into it. Let's do it. All right. All right. Should we put it on the ground to determine height here? What do you guys think? We do the seat first? Oh No, I've heard about this seat. There's this company called Vevor as far as I can tell their product portfolio is made up of whatever the hell we felt like making I mean they've got everything from ultrasonic cleaners to kind of dangerous sounding high-pressure compressors. Anyway, this is oh, wow the base of the seat, I guess? Yes. Here's the rest of it. Oh boy, so here's how it works. you adjust the tension with this little lever right here depending on your weight and It's like you put the seat on it calibrate it and then it kind of bounces Yeah, I couldn't exactly figure it out either as far as I could tell is once you had your tension set you just lift The seat up and it gets locked into the sprung position. Okay, and then when you sit on it You kind of just like bounce up and down a little how does this mount? So we gotta pull these screws off on the side here sure and then we're just gonna hook it on there Hook it on there stop some bolts in okay now technically this is designed to go in a forklift or in a tractor But we just kind of like the vibe, you know, like it's got an authentic feel that money just can't buy Did we really have to buy this? Jake kind of went crazy on the purchasing. Oh, it was Jake. Yeah, I knew it. This is just under his purchase approval limit That's why I didn't know about it. Oh am I able to just slide this on there? Well, that's all it is. Okay, you ready Jordan? Yep. Help me line it up Oh, let's go watch I was ready to watch not to help Okay. Hey nice. See look at that's great. Oh, yeah Now what's this lifting business we gotta do? Yeah, I guess we gotta bring her down now. What is with the size of this seat? How is that adult sized? Oh, oh It just disengaged and now you lift it back up And it locks back in. Yeah, but it doesn't it doesn't spring Well, you gotta be heavy enough to make it spring. Let's get you on it Quality Oh I guess without a good time to take a closer look at our wheel too So it just goes on with a little there you go twisty on like that. And okay, this is this is quite vertical. Is it? Oh yeah, okay. Yeah, I see it. 22 programmable buttons, paddle shifters, gonna have to lose those immediately. But I do like the radio button. Breaker, breaker, we've got a... Yeah, I don't know, trucker lingo. Crap. There she is. Oh god, you were rolling on that? All right. Well, anyway. Oh, we're gonna need a screen. We got that. Oh, hey, look at that. It's a Justin. He's just in time. I bet he's never heard that before either. No, never. For our displays, we chose what we had lying around in the warehouse from LTX. That's not what Jordan wrote in here, but I'm pretty sure that's the real reason. Anyway, it's a TCL S-series 4K 55S4 something something. The point is it's great bang for the buck at 350 Canadian rubles with low input lag, entry-level HDR. Okay, it's 60 hertz, but realistically, do we need a high refresh rate for trucking? Does this seem a little high? Oh, I mean, no, I got, right. It's all about theSit down and find out. Right, right, right. It's trucker ergonomics. So I'm looking, hmm, actually, no, it might need to go. How hard is it for it to come down a few inches? It does not. Oh, good. Let's do that then. Okay. Come down a couple more inches, I would say. Wait! Jordan! I mean, that's not bad, actually. Did I say Jordan? Justin! You did. Good days around here. Well, look, I just... Might have been called worse. I'm used to yelling at him. It's like with kids. Like, occasionally, you'll just be yelling at one of the kids, and... No matter who's in trouble, you just say the name of the biggest troublemaker. Oh yeah, that's good. Hold it there, hold it... Back it up! Back it up! All right. What, you don't want immersiveness, Jordan? I don't want to punch the window. Now you're probably wondering about the system that we're using to power such an awesome looking SimRig. And well, it's whatever we found in storage. It's a Starforge pre-built that with a 12900KF and a 3080Ti is more than enough to handle Euro truck simulator based on these minimum system requirements. Our pals at Logitech sent over a G515 TKL wireless keyboard and a Pro X2 super light wireless mouse. This setup is not the most optimal for this kind of keyboard and mouse. Realistically, their little like integrated track pad combo thing might've been a better choice, but hey, we're gonna make this work. Let's launch it. You cannot move freely about the world because you don't have a truck. I tried to buy us a truck, but Tanner put us into debt. Okay, sort by price. I mean, yeah, how about ice cream? All right. Who doesn't like ice cream? Offer expires in five minutes. Like, is this in real time? Yes. Like, these are real jobs, like, in the game world? Yeah. Yeah. What?! Don't let anyone down. God, no pressure. Wait, what? There she goes. Yeah, but I'm not, I didn't put it, oh, well, I didn't use the clutch. I guess I don't need it. Hey, cool! It's time to make a delivery. Use the Root Advisor to see where you are and where you need to go. There's more gears than one, by the way. I, yeah, well, I'm in the, I'm in the parking lot, Jordan! It also redlines at 2000 RPM, so you don't really got a lot to work with. Oh wow, yeah, how about that? Oh my goodness. Also, there's a gate there. I mean, yeah, but like, I'm a semi- truck. What does a gate mean to me? Oh, okay, apparently a lock. Not even a scratch on it, look at that. That's incredible. We're on the open road, boys. We're truckin'. Yes, indeed, we're truckin'. Okay, this really feels like a hack with all of this paddle shifting, though. Well, we do have a shifter right here. I mean, come on, please. Oh, that's not quite your style? Hang on, hang on. Oh, boy, jeez! Why you tryin' to distract me here? I'm drivin', boys! Oh, God, which way am I going? How do I signal? Oh, boy, we're just-Left, left, left. I know, I know what-You said which way am I going? I asked how to signal, I know which way I'm going. Oh, God, which way am I going? Oh, God, which way am I going? How about this? Oh, no way! Yeah, yeah, that's more like it. Wow, where did we get this? It's from SimPanel. And then the custom length rod and adapter were made by me. Oh, right on! This is great. So what, we just take the knob off of this one. I got you. Wow. Oh, dude, buddy, wow, that is so cool That might be a little far yeah, it's okay. We don't use seventh. Anyways, it's fine. Oh, okay. Sure. Okay. Yeah, let's go right there Do we have a base? Yes Let's give you a keyboard stand. Oh, that would be really useful. It's that in the notes Am I supposed to say anything about it? It is in the notes somewhere. Okay, it's a keyboard stand next level Oh, it's from next level. There you go Is there a reason we didn't put that on in the first place? Because you wanted to do a simple setup first. Oh, well, that's what you get for listening to me I know right we should know better by now, but That is a lot better. Now what? All right, so this is the fun part. Now we got to roll through all the gears. Okay. Click on the thing so you can select the button. Joy, where it says Joy button 14. Click that. All right. Okay, so you just put it into first. Yes. That's reverse. Oh, bloody. And so you gotta push down over, yeah, there you go. You got it. I've driven a stick before. Riveting. I did not see if there were any cars coming before I decided to start making this turn. I could really use a bit of a wider field of view. Do we have any more of these TVs, Andy? We might. Just go that way. Am I in third? Oh, fourth. You're in fourth. It says over there as well. If that's easier to read. How am I only going 23 kilometers an hour? You're very slow. There's also a red light coming. I mean, it'll turn green. That's very confident of you. I think it's going to turn green. I think it was green. Oh, dude, you get a ticket? You lost 80 f*** euros. What the heck? Yeah, you think that's funny, Jordan? You think that's funny? Oh, oh, well I guess I better break. Oh my God, she takes a minute to stop. Okay. Yeah, we gotta use more TVs. Yeah, I need more TVs. There's no way I can play this with less than three TVs. No, unacceptable. Okay, yeah, that looks pretty good to me. Pretty close. Oh yeah, bud. Oh yeah, bud. I mean, hold on a second. Colin, he does his best. Can you lift it up a bit? Up. Up. Okay. No, no, no. I'll do it. Forget it. Wow. Boy, is that ever something. Okay, we can get these angles a little bit. These angles are not great. I'm working on it. What did you guys do over here? I'm working on it. You're making it so much worse, Jordan. No, I'm not. Yes, you are. You can't see what you're doing. That's fair. Okay, that's good. Ben, you got to bring the height down a little bit. No, stop! It's ever so slight. You know what? It's good. It's good. It's good. Don't touch it anymore. That millimeter isn't going to matter to you. Yeah, it's fine. Oh my god, this is more like it. Dude. Now I can see where I'm going. Let's turn this bad boy on. Red light. She's yellow. No, no, we could do a rolling stop. We could do a rolling stop. Okay, hold on. Rolling stop. 80 euros, baby. No, what? No, no, no. I stopped. I stopped. I stopped, brother. With 80 euros. No, we did it. Where? In the corner. What? No, I'm... No, no. You blew past the line, man. Well, yeah, but the line is... I mean, it's arbitrary. It's paint. Fun fact. I failed my first driving test, road test, for stopping past stop lines, I think, four times. I just see them as more of a suggestion. I mean, I can't see for s*** past the thing without... if I had not pulled out a little bit. Do you need more monitors? Oh, I'm taking this exit right away. Okay. Dude, I'm only going 37 kilometers an hour? You're not very fast. Yeah, what the heck? You're supposed to do 80 here, it says. 80? Yeah. Did I put it in reverse? Oh, we stalled it. Did I just kill my car truck? Oh my god I'm gonna have to start on a hill. I don't want to start on a hill. You're an eighth. I'm an eighth Oh gosh darn it. Second. All right. There we go. There we go. That's what I need. Second second You've driven before right? I've driven before and never anything with gears this short. Oh my god I'm supposed to be going a hundred that guy just about hit me. He's all over the road Okay, here we go. Am I in seventh now? Okay. I really don't like the indicator on this one. Okay, buddy, move! Move, move, move! Wait, where am I supposed to be going? Oh my god, I'm supposed to take this exit. No, no, I got this. I got this. I got this. I got this. I'm just gonna... She's uh, she's revved a little high. She's revved a little high. She's revved a little high. You got this. Okay, uh, which way am I going? Oh my god, I gotta go to the right. Okay, this is where we fail. Okay, the road's optional. The road's optional. Uh, what, what? Probably like fifth, fifth or something? Am I in fifth? I'm in fifth. Yeah. Oh man, I think I landed it. I think I landed the gear there. So what happens if I do hit someone? I don't know. Go for that tanker. Yeah, I want the tanker. Hey buddy, get off the road! That's my road! Oh jeez! The tree. Yep, I found the tree. Let's finish off the setup and we'll come back to the missions tomorrow. Boy, this is quite the get-up. Where'd you even find a belt with a big L on it? Amazon. I love what you've done with the cockpit though. Are these my p** jars? Indeed. Why do I have so many? Can't stop trucking. Addicted to the shindig. I guess it's time for the full experience now. Oh, I thought we didn't get it! Okay, in the time we've been working on this, Moza released a truck wheel. And we did that! I was told we didn't get it in time! This is so cool! Oh, we upgraded the base as well. I guess the point of that is just more modularity or do you just need the stronger base to account for the additional? You don't need it, but it gives you more force feedback. Oh! This is so cool! Okay, now you have some different controls you're gonna have to learn. You gotta use your panel box now. Oh lordy. So accessory one is gonna be your electronics on. So now you can see your dash lights up. Now just turn the key a little bit, you don't have to hold it, and your engine is now fired up. No way! How fun is that? Did you configure the lights and the pie beams and stuff? Yeah. Yes. Oh, no way I could see it! Okay, it's time to really truck now. Your parking brake is on, so you gotta pull your parking brake. Nope, you gotta pull it. It says pull to apply. Well, it's backwards. All right. Oh, no way! Oh, the map's on a tablet? Yes. Oh, that's so cool. It's running an app called Sim Hub. Where am I supposed to go? Unfortunately, it actually doesn't give you your GPS direction, so you still have to look at the one down at the car there. Oh, no way! I could look at both maps. Well, no, no, I'm turning around. I'm turning around, brother. I started out with, \"Man, why is anybody playing a sim game about driving a truck?\" And now I'm sitting here in this rig and I'm like, \"Heck yeah!\" Like, this is freaking awesome! You're going left at the next intersection. Yeah, I'm going left at the next intersection. Also, feel free to skip gears. They do in real trucks anyways. Oh, really? Yes. I mean, okay. And actually, nine times out of ten, when you're shifting gears on a real truck, you don't use the clutch either. What? Yes. No way. I'm joking, you just run match. Oh wow, I mean, I won't be doing that, but sure. Okay, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr. Okay, we're going straight to fourth. We got a signal, can't see my mirror. You're okay, well, yes. Good luck everybody. Oh wow, here's a dick. Buddy, buddy, hey, where's the horn? Where's the horn? I'm driving here. So I'm gonna toggle this thing, and then I'm in eighth. Hey, there we go, okay, I'm not in the lane, but I'm in the right gear. I'm going right. Oh, you gotta tell me a little earlier, son. I am a truck driver. I go where the open road leads me, and I signal because I'm a professional driver. This is incredible. The only thing it needs is like like a vibrating seat That would be freaking awesome. Yeah, that wasn't in Jake's budget. Yeah You know what's really wild? I feel so immersed in the game right now that when I go to turn left or I go to change lanes I want a shoulder check No, I'm serious though like more screens for that. This is so cool Approach the entrance gate To get a clearance to bring the cargo to a particular spot. Maybe a good time to adjust the marking spot Where to stop the truck. Oh boy. Okay. Well surely what could go wrong? It'll only take a couple hours Trailer delivery, where do you need it? Let's play it safe Sorry, I'm in a hurry now Where do you need it? Confirm Proceed to unloading area. Oh man, no problem bud. Am I in reverse? Um, I'm in reverse right now. Yeah, you do appear to be. And I stalled it. No, the other way, damn it! You've backed up before, right? Yeah, I have, okay? I used to actually drive our trailer all the time. I know this. Oh my god, you know what the issue is, is it just takes so long to correct. I was turning it the right way, I just didn't account for how ridiculously long it takes to course correct. My goodness, how do people do this? Okay, no, no, no, I got this, I got this. Serenity now. Right? You're in the wrong lane there, but... Dude, I'm working on it. Oh god, what just happened? You just hit a cow. No, I hit no cow. F*** I have an innovative new idea. Okay. They can just go around to the back of the truck and get everything. Okay. Okay. Here we go. This is it. We just got to take her in for the landing. No, no, no, no, dang it, dang it, wait, no, no, that's okay, that's okay, that's okay, that's okay. That's okay, we're good, we're good, we're good. Okay, so we just need to straighten her out a little bit. Okay, there we go, there we go, and then I just gotta fall over in. Tap, tap, tappers. It's ready to go. I mean, how do I tell if I in? You'll tell you there, turn green. Yeah! Woo! Now you hit the trailer un-attach switch on the button box. Trailer un-attach. Decoupling. Nice! There you go, you're late. 61 hours. So this is how you end up with negative money. The last thing I told Moza we'd mention is that the Xbox wheel is moddable with different frames around it. And on PC, you've got all kinds of different options for wheels that can go onto their wheelbases. If you guys enjoyed this video, you might enjoy the time we checked out a $30 racing setup versus a $10,000 racing setup. That was a lot of fun.",

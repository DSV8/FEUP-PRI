    "transcript": "- [Linus] VR gaming, couch gaming, tabletop gaming, board gaming, this room, does it all! Or it will. You see, beneath it's tidy, organized facade is a veritable chaos zone of straps, adapters, cables, game consoles, controllers, and all other manner of accessories that I need to turn into a cohesive gaming experience. And, oh, at the center of all of it, is gonna be LG's, QNED mini LED. LG sponsored this video, and this bad boy will hold over a thousand nits in a 25% window. That coupled with features like auto low latency mode, extremely low input lag, and accurate colors are gonna make this the perfect centerpiece for this space. Because, as you guys may or may not have noticed, there's a lot of freaking bright windows coming into this room, meaning that a low brightness TV is not really gonna cut it. Oh, look at this! The cavalry's here. I'm obviously gonna need some help. Oh, I was about to say help from our sponsor, but our sponsor's LG. Roll the intro. (upbeat computerized music) - The first thing we're gonna need is your Geek Squad skills, Jamie. That's right, you're mounting another TV. - Why not? - But this one presents some special challenges. See, we thought LG was gonna send the 86 inch version of this, which is an amazing set, but we got the 75. That's why Jake got a wall mount that weighs over 50 freaking pounds. - Team lift. - Meanwhile, Dan, you and I actually get the worst job. - Oh crap. - [Linus] We get to move the foosball table which, prepare yourself, weighs about a thousand pounds. - I don't think I'm that strong. - [Linus] And clear all the camping stuff outta here. So, first things first, let's get this moved over that way. - Yeah. - Oh, he was lying. - Well, it feels like it to me. The thing about being really slow to put away your Christmas stuff is by the time you put it away, it's almost time to take it back out again. (laughing) There's not really anywhere to pile this stuff in here. - [Dan] Yeah. There's some right here. - Oh my gosh. - In all seriousness. How do you want this organized? - There's no plan. It's real. - Ah. - I mean, I get it. You're new here. You figure, ah, it's gotta be just an act the way he is on camera. (laughing) - Organized. - Three guesses what this is. - Suppository? - Clear evidence that I have small children. - Ah, that's what I was going for. Close though. - Hello, homeowner. Where would you like me to hang the TV? - Oh my God. Can you just dial back the Geek Squad for 10 minutes? - You said I had to use my Geek Squad skills. Where would you like me to hang it then tell me it's too high? - [Jamie and Linus] (laughing) - Here's what I'm thinking. We're probably gonna end up with the 86 inch version of it at some point, 'cause it's a pretty big wall, but we also have to consider that this can't go too far that way. - [Jamie] Yeah. - [Linus] So that we have access to the vacuum hose plug. - [Jamie] Yeah. - And then it can't go too far this way because this grill right here is the air return for the HVAC. We've got both power and network in a recessed wall plate here so that we could even mount something like a completely flat gallery style TV. We've got a conduit here that runs two locations. It runs down to the bottom. Ah, so if we wanted to have an AV receiver or something like that in the console, it would... wait, what? Holy crap did they not? Oh, they didn't punch the hole for it. - [Jamie] No. - Okay. We'll have to find that. - [Jamie] Yeah, boy. - Wait. Oh, I see. Wait, what the... what the hell was their intention here? Oh my God. - Oh, it's right behind the whites. - It just is right behind the electrical socket! Why would they do that? - What you... as you can..umm... It's not... that ain't gonna work. - Yeah. This is stupid. - You want me to take the, thing off? - Yeah, I should kill the breaker here, though. Were you about to stick a screwdriver in there? - Yeah, whatever. What's 120 volts between friends? Yeah, if we share it, it's only half. - This one's tripped. (microwave singing) - [Jamie] Something's singing! - Yeah, it's the microwave. The breaker apparently tripped. - [Jamie and Dan] No, no. - Oh these are, these are not the right ones. - [Jamie and Dan] No. - No. - [Jamie] No. - No. - No. - [Jamie] Yeah, it was that one. - Wait, so it's off? - [Jamie and Dan] Yeah, it's off. - We found where the fish wire comes out. - Yeah. - But it appears to be just like a hole in the wall. There's act no actual conduit in there. - Oh good. - Yeah. We have no idea if that's going where we think it is. But the fish wire seems to know where it is. - Yeah. This is not very professionally done in my opinion. - Mmmmm. - Our low voltage contractors watching, you heard me. - Me? I wouldn't have done it that way, but I'm also not a low voltage contractor. - Why is nothing ever simple? That's what I'd like to know. (hitting an object in the wall) - Oh, there it is. - Yeah. Okay. - [Jamie] Okay. Well it works. - Well, I guess it works. There's just no point of egress for it. - No. - And there was no plan for HDMI, other than just...what? - [Jamie] You kind of... - Just run it like bare back right next to the fricking metal contacts? Like I don't understand what their intention was. Also, they kinked this Cat6a - [Jamie] In a couple of spots. Nice screwdriver. - Thanks. Soon to be LTTstore.com eventually, someday. - We are going to take the TV outta the box, Dan and I. We're gonna measure up the plate on the back of the TV. Dan doesn't know how to use a knife. That's fine. And then we're gonna see how it's gonna sit on the wall. We'll use the template for that. - [Linus] while they're working on that, I am finally going to replace my ancient NF-S12A fans with these NF-P12 reduxes. They're better for static pressure, which I actually found was a problem because I've got a grill in the bottom here that made it so that it was quite a bit more restrictive. This is the compartment that contains the VR gaming PC, by the way. Whatever you do, don't break the sponsor TV. - [Jamie] That's a good idea. - [Linus] It's a thick boy. That's how you get full array local dimming, though. It uses an IPS panel, and then it has a mini LED array behind it that will selectively dim in the darker parts of the scene and selectively brighten in the brighter parts of the scene to achieve a much, much better than native contrast ratio. Natively, this thing will do a little over a thousand to one, according to ratings.com. And then with the most aggressive local dimming setting, it'll do more like 6,000 to one. - Andy, I'm gonna put the arms on the back of the TV, and Dan's gonna throw the instructions away 'cause we don't read them anyway. But why we're doing that is so that we can take a measurement so that we know where the TV's gonna sit on the wall. Dan, have I ever told you how many TVs I've mounted? - Judging by your experience? Maybe one or two, at least. - At least two. It's like somewhere between six and 800. I did it for four days a week, 10 hours a day, two years. - Now you get to continue doing that. - No, I'm letting you do it this time. - Oh (beep). - There appear to be plenty of studs to choose from. - Oh, there's four in this room. (stud finder beeping) - [Linus] Nice. - [Jamie] (Laughing) - This is gonna be way better. Ah, not only did I upgrade the fans, but I also got these cool little noise isolating thing-a-ma-boobers that cover the entire frame of the fan. So we shouldn't have any vibrations from these bad boys. I don't think my arms are long enough. - [Jamie] Oh! - ... to reach both sides of this. - [Jamie] Call Slenderman! - [Andy] You need Slenderman! - No, I'm good. I got it. - [Jamie] Slenderman's useless. - I wish I had put this tool kit somewhere else. Alright, those aren't going anywhere. Cool. - Hey, Linus, do you want to be upset about something? Dan wants to make you upset. - Sorry, What? - This is about where the bottom of the TV's gonna sit roughly. - The bottom of the TV's gonna be here? - Yeah. - [Jamie] Yeah, that's way too tall. - [Dan] So we can take this in. Just bring it down until it's like... meh. - Uh-huh. - Or we could just hang it above the fireplace as God intended. - Disgusting. That might actually function. - Dan, are we gonna do it like we did the projector screen where we completely mess up the magnet holes and then have to put the thing on twice? - How many TVs have you done? - 800 or so? I don't know. You're the one measuring there, kiddo. - So it's gonna be slightly off center. You okay with that, Linus? - [Linus] I mean, do I have a choice? - [Jamie] The full motion part of it will make it on center, but also the plate will slide on the, on the whatchama... oh wait. No it won't. - Oh, the whojamajoodles. - 'Cause what we could do is take this off. - Yeah. - And then have a horrible, horrible hole in the wall. Like that one. - [Linus] What? Why is it that every time I tune into what they're saying, it's something awful. - [Jamie] Something awful? Yeah, well, um, so where's the sledgehammer? And then we'll make a bigger hole. - Also, don't let him see this. - [Jamie] Don't...yeah, don't let him see that. - Why don't we sort through here and figure out what some of the key items that need to go in the console are? We've got the WiiU, network switch. This will do 10 gig to the main computer here, and then a 10 gig link back to the house and one gig to everything else. That's from Jesus. Ooh! VR trackers. This is a vibe tracker 2.0 and a track belt. So this gives me hip presence in VR. That's why I can never lie in VR. OG shield, a big fat heavy one. Ultimately all gonna have to be wired in somehow. (drill whirring) - Ow! That ain't going anywhere. - [Jamie] Can you try and hang off it, Dan? - Oh my goodness. You guys are putting the TV on. Do you need help? Can I help? - Nope, we're done. That's it. - That was it? It doesn't look very done. I guess it's a good time to mention the anti-glare coating on the screen. Yeah. It's not on right now, but that's another thing that the additional brightness will help with is reducing glare from these windows back here. Wow. In spite of the weight, ummm... Hey, credit to this mount. It's pretty manageable, actually. I kind of have access to the conduit hole here. Okay, this TV is officially never coming this far out from the wall again, 'cause I'm gonna need some more slack. - There comes a time in every man's life when he must move the stand closer to the wall. - [Linus] Yeah, that's that's what I was gonna say. - Ooh - What, what? - [Jamie] We...we tried to rip the... - Well that was close. - Yeah. Oh we good! - Oh, look at that. - Look at that. - Yeah. Like easy. = Yeah. - Freaking easy. All right. - [Jamie] Our task cam's batteries are dead. So we're filming on my cellular telephone. He's currently taking down a lighthouse for Linus's V-Har unit. Now we're gonna go up in the attic and take that wire down. Oh yeah! Dan is currently engulfed in whatever that is. - [Dan] Doesn't taste good. It's trapped behind a thing. I have to go deeper in. I'm going to get very, very fluffy. I hope nothing bites me. It goes through the (beep) wall? Where is this moving anything over there? Where you are? - [Jamie] Yes. - Oh, can you... - [Jamie] pull some black wire? Dan has emerged from the attic more fluff than man. - (coughing) Dan, tell me how they taste. - Like blood. - [Jamie] Oh no! (laughing) Ah, success. - Oh God! - [Jamie] Jamie, how would you rate our success today? - Yes. - [Jamie] Yes, yes outta five? - Yeah, five outta seven, perfect score. - [Jamie] Perfect score? All right. - I'm hoping to just transplant my old Harmony remote setup here and just pick up right where I left off. So it's one button to select all the right inputs and outputs and, you know, power on devices, power off devices. If not, I'll have to find another solution. There are other universal remotes that exist, now that Logitech shuttered the Harmony division. Or I could just rely on CEC. But the issue is that with a PC, relying on CEC, which is where you power on one device, and it tells the associated devices to power on, is that PC's are just not really designed with that in mind. So what you need is one of these old Microsoft IR receivers, and then you can tell it to issue a sleep or wake command to the computer so that it won't just be sucking back a hundred watts all the time. It's got a 30, 80 in there. - [Jamie] Soldering some wires. And then Dan and I are gonna try and figure out how this thing works. Some kind of transfer... - [Jamie] Yeah! - [Jamie] Yeah! We're definitely doing that. - Well, I put the transformer in, and that didn't immediately explode, so... - [Jamie] Sick! - Let's try it with this. - [Jamie] Okay. - Ready? - [Jamie] I see it. Something just happened. - Cool. - [Jamie] A light flashing. - Oh, it's moving! - [Jamie] Is there a laser inside? - There is a laser and there's a little motor, and it spins the laser and it blinds us. - [Jamie] Oh, don't breathe that. - Don't breathe this. Okay, we're done. - It's like, there's a law against everything going right in a vlog. Two out of our four power cables for the VR base stations are dead in some way. This one doesn't appear to terminate anywhere. And the one over on this side seems to have gotten a nail through it at some point, because we can find the other end of it, but he no work, no power. The good news is, hey, LG, good job. The TV managed to turn on, so that's awesome. But there is a bit of extra work that I'm gonna have to do because an excellent attempt was made at cable managing and installing everything into the console. But this computer does not go in like that because the intake is right here. So it needs to sit right side up so it can draw that fresh air from the bottom fans in. Let's go... oh wow! Look at this. This door's gonna come off too. Freaking fantastic. Thanks, Wayfair. Is this one from Wayfair? - [Yvonne] Yeah, it is. - [Linus] Yeah, it is. - Okay. Thank you. Oh, wonderful. - And let's never do that again. (laughing) - Here's something special about this machine. It's got this old, I believe it's made by Sonnet, old USB card that has an individual controller for everyone on the four ports. Having more than one of these on a single controller. And you know, some motherboards might have two or maybe three controllers, but having them share with any other devices can lead to unexpected problems. So I've given each of them their own dedicated USB controller. Freaking ridiculous. - Here we are. That is a coach. Go on. Oh man. That's how you use a coach. - Are we trying to make things look pretty for the video, or are we just trying to go for functional? - How about pretty functional? - Well, I have one thing that might make it look better, which is really easy. - A carpet! - A carpet! - What a good idea! - Let's do it. Yeah, let's do the carpet. - Okay. Now we go. We are not centered. - Not, not even, not even a little. We'll fix it in post. - I had these grand designs about how I was gonna put little magnetic things and have everything cable managed really perfectly against the back. But instead we're gonna do classic cable management. Okay. There now it's centered. I mean the space is starting to look kind of gamer-y actually. Alright, let's talk features finally! Okay. We got Dolby vision support. We've got film maker mode support. Here, if we find, oh, do I have Plex on here? Heck yeah. Is this even gonna find my Plex server? This was last plugged in at my old place. No internet connection. What? This switch is not powered. Oh, because I didn't plug it in. Is the sound bar kicked in? Settings? HDMI arc device. Look at that. Did it just pick it up? No problems. I mentioned that it has the alpha seven processor does like 4k scaling. This is 4k content anyway, but it has that. So that's the reason that I chose to use my old shield that does not do AI upscaling here. And then I've got my new shield over in the theater room. Actually the glare is not that bad, which is exactly the goal in this room. Even with the studio lights on. Motion smoothing is on. That's stupid. So let's go ahead and fix that. I think there's actually more optimal setting than off. So don't quote me on that. But off is one way to make sure you're not getting any kind of smoothing. Wow. The HDR looks awesome, though. I'm fairly certain it's on. It's not even ... wait, it's not on? You know, ratings said that their SDR readings for this TV were really good, like really bright, but wow! That's really bright. I thought HDR was enabled. Well, I guess we're sliding all the way to the right. Okay, and that's better. This looks awesome, though. Not much else to say. Thanks LG for sponsoring this video. We're gonna enjoy many an hour playing games in here. Massive shout out Dan and Jamie from logistics who were coerced into being here against their will. - [Jame And Dan] (moaning) - Help us. - If you enjoyed this video, maybe you'll enjoy the last time LG sponsored a living room facelift. Pretty cool video as well, stark before and after. - [Jamie] Oh, there's your problem. Your anus ain't distended enough. (laughing) Oh God.",

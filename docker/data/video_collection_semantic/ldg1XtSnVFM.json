    "transcript": "- [Austin] Today, we are taking a look at some of the most exciting Japanese dollar store tech pieces of products that we have ever seen because it's the first time we've ever done that. - [Matt] Yeah we don't, we don't know if these are good or not because we actually, we don't know. I have a box right here, but like, I don't know - [Austin] Hit me with an item. Let's let's evaluate The Bytech computer gaming speaker with changing multicolor lights. I like how they're trying very hard not to say RGB, just multicolor lights. - [Matt] Now Kinsey I'm not familiar with MINISO I'm not familiar with Daiso. Tell me about it. - [Kinsey] Daiso is a kind of well known Japanese dollar store basically. - [Matt] So you paid a dollar for these? - [Kinsey] Uh no. Not a single thing in this whole thing was over $20. - [Austin] So we've got ourselves a couple of 2.5 Watt speakers, which look very cool. Although they're quite small. We also have an interesting little dongle here. So it's both USB, which I assume is for the lights and then actual AUX for your boom boom pow. Wait, how much were these specifically? - [Kinsey] Uh the speakers, $10. - [Austin] I mean, 10 bucks is a reasonable price for some okay-ish speakers. - [Matt] You look see, as soon as we plugged it in we got nice like spectrum of color here. The fact that they're not in sync with each other - [Austin] I don't like that. - [Matt] Oh man. - [Austin] That's bothering me so much. - [Matt] Yeah. [Cheerful Music] - We'll get something that actually slaps. [Cheerful Music] - At max volume Not good At like mid volume, not bad. - [Austin] They sound not that much better than like monitor speakers or something, which is pretty low bar to entry. - [Matt] They look cooler than monitor speakers. - [Austin] It works for 10 bucks. - [Matt] I would like the, like, I would be so much more on board with these. If they were in sync, I'll give this a B - [Austin] Oh, is this a tier list now? - [Matt] No, but I mean, why not? - [Austin] I'll give it a C - [Matt] C, all right, crappy. Moving on. - [Austin] Ha Ha Ha. Got em! - [Matt] Sometimes what you're doing when you wanna jam out, you also want to feel Purrrty. - [Austin] Do not bring out a cat thing. - [Matt] We got the Light Lumiere LED Devil Ear Cat. I'm gonna say this was $9.99. [Kinsey] $17.99. - [Matt] $17.99! - [Austin] Ooh. - [Matt] Okay. - [Austin] Oh, there's a warning here. Very large warning. Do not pull it. Keep away from fire and water. Avoid contact with high temperature objects. - [Matt] We got the warning. Aaron gets mad. Every time I throw something off screen because then he has to put a little cartoon noise. [Explosive Noise] (maniacally laughing) - [Austin] Can we see, wait, can you turn towards your camera angle? Can we see the little the little face on the side of your ear cup here. - [Kinsey] Its a little bit uwu not gonna lie. - [Austin] A little bit. No, not quite that much. - [Matt] uwu? - [Austin] There you go that's it. Your uwu is blinking. - [Matt] Ooh. My uwu is way too aggressive here. [Cheerful Music] Way too much bass. It's just, it's cutting in and out. - [Austin] Ow. - [Matt] Yeah. They're not comfy by the way. I, I like, I didn't mention that at all. - [Austin] You know what it sounds like? AM radio. - [Matt] I'm gonna give this an uwu. - [Austin] I would give it a ooh. - [Matt] Moving on. Often in the comments people complain about Matt's too loud. Why is he always yelling? - [Austin] I agree. You're too loud. - [Matt] And I think that there is no evidence that I am too loud. - [Austin] Aaron can you please cut to the levels on his microphone? Being above the peak yeah thanks. [Digital Music] - [Matt] What we have here is a way to finally figure out if I'm too loud. We have a voice activated light bar. - [Austin] How much was this Kinsey? - [Kinsey] $15.95. [Spitting Sound] - [Austin] He just broke it. (laughing) - [Matt] Look, look I'm okay. This is a little too sensitive. - [Austin] Hello my friends and welcome. Welcome to this - [Matt] you really emphasized the wrong word there. - [Austin] Is subscribe now. - [Matt] Austin is not talking loud. - [Austin] Subscribe now. - [Matt] And it's peeking - [Austin] Here. Let's let's put, put it in the middle, right? So let's see. Check - [Matt] Lisa Frank Lisa Frank. I give this a D - [Austin] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's got USBC and it does basically work besides the fact that when you try to remove the plastic It breaks. - [Matt] It's too sensitive. - [Austin] You're too sensitive. - [Matt] Moving on. Next up we got - [Austin] Oh, good Lord. - [Matt] That. Remember, we love the cat ears. We gave those an S tier. But where do we put 'em when we're not, when we're not wearing them, - [Austin] We put them in the trash because they suck. Wait, wait, wait, wait wait. - [Matt] We keep 'em on our - [Austin] This looks cool. Is it actually gonna be cool? - [Matt] Multicolor Glo. - [Austin] So it looks rad on the photos. - [Matt] It does. - [Austin] I don't think it's gonna be rad. - [Matt] Here we go. - [Austin] The world isn't all (laughter) - [Matt] Kinsey, can we black out on the, on the lights? - [Austin] That is so underwhelming. (laughter) That is so underwhelming. It's so dim. - [Matt] It is. - [Austin] I don't know how well this comes up on camera, but in person, the bottom LED is actually reasonably bright. - [Matt] Yeah the bottom is good. - [Austin] This, this top, the thing that actually would matter is dimmer than Matt's outlook on life. After a Thursday night. - [Matt] How much was this? - [Kinsey] $15.95 - [Austin] $15? - [Matt] This is not good. I don't like this at all. Like you could save yourself 15 bucks. - [Matt] I don't think it looks that good. - [Austin] No, I think it looks ugly. - [Matt] You can get a nice like metal stand. That looks way better for like 12 bucks. - [Austin] Yeah. We need a real high quality high class item. That is not only worth our time but also worth your time to subscribe and ringling the ding ling bell because you love your buddies, Austin, Matt and Kinsey out here wasting money. To give you a few minutes on your lunch break to pass the time or on the toilet or wherever you watch this is - [Matt] It's appropriate for all the (beep) we throw at you. (laughter) Here's the thing you all loved and appreciated our weird keyboard video where we had a lot of finger blast potential. - [Austin] Stop saying those words. - [Matt] Now this isn't like - [Austin] Like it's not a compound word, Matt. - [Matt] This is not a authentic cherry keyboard. Like we had in that video. However, we do have The gaming keyboard multicolor back lit. I mean that's uh that is Holy crap! That's like screaming pink. I can hear how cheap that is. - [Austin] Well, the thing is - [Matt] Wait, wait, wait. So it's got these rubber pads on them. Feel that - [Austin] It's just plastic. - [Matt] It's just, it's molded plastic to pretend like it has rubber feet. - [Austin] How much was this though? - [Kinsey] $15.95. - [Austin] The lettering on these keys may be among the worst I've ever seen. Like look at the I and the shift key. It's like twice as big as a regular I. - [Matt] This has an internet Explorer button. This makes the CDR king that we saw look like a custom - [Austin] Actual king. - [Matt] Yeah - [Austin] I'll agree with you on this, ah, man, this is just bad. - [Matt] Well, the keyboard was a bust but our gaming setup doesn't have to be. What we got here is a MINISO gamerfied mouse. - [Austin] How is it that every single time they changed, They'd never say RGB. This was just called Colorful. - [Matt] I don't know what it is about cheap mice. That they're just like how can we make this the ugliest possible thing? - [Austin] Oh, good Lord. It just goes down. There's no springiness or anything like that. - [Matt] Plug it in my friend. - [Austin] Whoa, it's getting colorful. We're green. We're Teal. Like someone else. Purple. I mean, I feel like at this point it's hard to get a terrible mouse. Like I feel like even the most dirt cheap of the included Dell mouse or whatever with your all in one still has at least an okay mouse. - [Matt] I, you know what? - [Austin] Like this is probably the best product we've looked at So far. - [Matt] Yeah, by far was the best product we looked at. Like if you needed a mouse and you weren't around like a Micro-center, you could do a lot worse for this. - [Austin] How much was this one again? - [Kinsey] $10 - [Austin] Thumbs up on this 10 bucks. Thumbs on this one. - [Matt] But if you love the ugly color and want to double down on this setup the only product so far that we have that has been RGB. - [Austin] Oh it says RGB finally, multiple lighting modes, soft. - [Matt] Same. - [Austin] USBC. - [Matt] USBC, baby. Let's go. - [Austin] I'll say it feels nice. Uh I mean, feel the mouse on it. Isn't it. Doesn't it's literally doesn't want slide feel how like sticky that is. - [Matt] Oh. Oh. - [Austin] This feels fine to me. Like my fingers but it actually is like incredibly high friction. Oh look. - [Matt] Oh. - [Austin] The whole thing, I like this mouse pad. This mousepad is solid. It's not quite as, as sort of slippy as the surface as I'd like it's friction city over here. - [Matt] Should we lube it up? - [Austin] No, you do that with keyboard. Why wouldn't you do it with a mouse? How much was this pad? - [Kinsey] $17.95. - [Matt] Black out again. That looks nice. - [Austin] It does. It does significantly better than the mouse. I like this. I wish it was a little bit of a slipperier surface but I would really put most of that up to this mouse, which just is it just doesn't slide - [Matt] For 17 bucks. I think the mouse pad is a, is a buy. We have plenty of, of good things here, but what about our phones? Do you ever wish when you're taking a lovely lovely bathroom selfie that you were a little bit more gamerfied? look, we got you covered here with a 3.5 inch RGB ring light for your phone. - [Austin] Oh wow. This thing's actually kind of large. - [Matt] Whoa, whoa. - [Austin] So Matt, you ready to selfie it up? - [Matt] Here is just a regular old. [Club Music] [Camera Shutters] Okay. So let's black out real quick. [Club Music] [Camera Shutters] - [Austin] I apologize for what you've just seen. And if you'd like to talk to someone, please - Text hashtag 4, 2, 2, 2, 3, 8, 4, Batman symbol. The letter two. - [Austin] You're the selfie master. So I'll let you rank this one. - [Matt] Uh I'm giving this a D. Not all of us are sitting in front of the mirror taking beautiful selfies all day long. Sometimes we like to game on our phones. Me and I like to play Rage Shadow Legend. - [Austin] Clash Royale. - [Matt] They didn't sponsor this video. Who wants to be on a touchscreen? No one. - [Austin] No one. - [Matt] So what we have here from Daiso is some operations stick for smartphone games. - [Austin] So are these the ones that you have to stick on your phone every single time you wanna play the game? Do you see how big these sticks are? That's a big stick. That's like double the size of an Xbox stick. That's a - [Matt] I think that's a pretty average. - [Austin] I wanna use - [Matt] The little stick - [Austin] The little stick for my moving - [Matt] Okay. literally nothing is happening. - [Austin] Try the big stick. - [Matt] You need a big phone for this. - [Austin] Yeah. It takes up a half your damn phone. That just doesn't work. - [Matt] It doesn't. But what if it did work? Let's continue with that because we also have some more stuff from there. So theoretically for any of these what you could do is just customize it however you want it to be. And this one's actually like vaguely comfortable. What you do is you just kind of put it up top here and then like your shooting would be right there. - [Austin] If you're gonna do any of this stuff. My big problem is that you're first gonna need to spend a while getting things set up, right? So you gotta attach two, three, four things to your phone. But the other thing is you have to spend some time making sure that your layout is just right. Nothing really clicks exactly into place whatever you're having to manually move everything (inaudible 00:10:49) but also with the actual little add-ons seems cool. Maybe if you really, really, really get your setup dialed in, it might be okay. But if you just wanna set this thing on your phone and play for a few minutes, but you're gonna spend so much time just trying to set it up. - [Matt] So this was all $6, $6! - [Austin] You know, what's also $6? - [Matt] Not the, the ROG Gamer Phone 3 which is like $700. - [Austin] I think every word you just said was wrong. - [Matt] Let us know in the comments what you think about MINISO and Daiso tech here. whether it was too much too little, just right like subscribe, follow, ringling the dingling button. Thank you for breaking those before I got the thumbnail and we'll catch you in the next one. [Closing Theme Music]",

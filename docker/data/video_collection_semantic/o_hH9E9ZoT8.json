    "transcript": "- Yo guys, Jonathan here, and if you're a fan of the Best Tech Under 50, get excited because today it is back and it is better than ever. I've teamed up with ColorWare not only showcase my favorite skin of the month, but also to give one of you guys a chance to win everything featured in today's video, so if that sounds good, you're excited, make sure you drop a like down below. And definitely feel free to subscribe and turn on notifications if you haven't yet so you don't miss future videos like this. So this month's skin from ColorWare is dubbed Tracer. This is brand new, it is stealthy, it is futuristic, it is unique to say the least. Here I have it on the Pixel XL, which looks super clean. And if you own a Pixel and you haven't been a fan of that glass panel, this is actually a fantastic way to cover it up and give it a super unique look. Now maybe you don't own a Pixel, maybe you're on team Galaxy S8, maybe you're on team iPhone 7, it doesn't matter because this is available for those as well, which I will link to down below. So first up for those who caught my Galaxy S8 desk set up video, I featured that bright orange keyboard right there behind me, and the reaction was either holy crap that is amazing, where can I get that bright, bold, beautiful, orange rectangle of squares or stop it man, it's like I'm looking into the sun get it out of my face. So with that said, for those you aren't a fan of Sunny D, that's where this guy comes in. The Anker ultra compact Bluetooth keyboard which is budget friendly and comes in at just 20 bucks. Now before we continue, I'm not afraid to address it. It is no secret where they took their design inspiration from, this looks and feels like a cheap Apple keyboard. It's almost like Johnny Ive took a vacation and Phil Schiller, filled in. Now while this may look like an Apple keyboard, the good news is that's it's not limited to Mac. It's gonna work on iOS, Android and for those who bleed green, red, blue or red again in any of those combinations, it's also gonna work on the PC master race side of things as well. So all that is fantastic, but if there were any down sides with this keyboard, I would say it comes down to build quality. The plastic does leave a little to be desired. It's not gonna break by typing on it but you definitely don't want to slam this thing around. Pass that though, it is super lightweight which makes it a great option for traveling, aesthetically it is clean as hell. You also get stellar battery life at around six months and if you've been looking for a great, inexpensive Bluetooth keyboard that is under 25 bucks, this is a solid pick up. So next up, at number three, is this little guy right here. And if you own an Apple watch, it is one of the coolest gadgets that I've come across. What it is, is this tiny compact portable battery bank, but what's awesome is, there's a built in Apple watch dock smashed inside this guy, so say it's the end of the day, maybe you forgot to charge your Apple watch last night but you need just a little bit more juice to get you through this is all you need. Also I gotta give this thing some brownie points for the built-in key chain, which allows you to pay homage to the great Dwayne The Rock Johnson, (magical sound) now this is gonna work with both series one and two and what I thought was a really nice touch was the built-in LED battery indicator so that way at any given point of the day, you know how much charge you have left. Now if there were any down sides, I would say it's a fact that this does require Micro USB-C, if it did have Lightning, that would've taken it over the top and made this absolutely perfect but for the price it is not a terrible thing to deal with. It's relatively inexpensive, it works as advertised and if you're someone who's ever had a problem with not charging their Apple Watch, this could come in super clutch. So next up, speaking of Apple watches and tiny, small objects, this is the Elago W3 Stand, which is amazing for anyone into that classic Apple design. What it does essentially is turn your Apple watch into this super tiny, compact original Macintosh. It looks awesome. It is not new by any means, but the reason I'm featuring it today is that even though this is the best tech under 50, right now this is on sale for 10 bucks. How long is that gonna last, I have no idea, so if you want one, make sure you jump on it. But at the very least, it is a super fun piece of tech to have. Now if I were to describe this, the words that come to mind would be hefty, thick, beefy even. Not gonna say you could knock someone out with this, but you probably could and it's gonna do all of that without scratching your Apple watch. (bell tolls) Now aside from looking cool and also being a potentially great object to chuck at someone, there actually is some function with this. It will work in nightstand mode with your Apple watch so you could have this really cool, vintage set up to charge your watch at night, and for 10 bucks it is a no brainer. So next up at number two are the Photive HF1 Headphones. And I get it, you've probably seen your fair share of wireless Bluetooth headphones on budget tech episodes, but the thing is, these don't look like they're 50 bucks and more importantly they don't sound like they're 50 bucks. So right off the bat, build quality with these things are fantastic. They are made with lots and lots of metal. They look great, they feel great and more importantly they do all of this while still being lightweight. Now one of the more impressive features with these headphones is the fact that you can expect around 12 hours of battery life. You combine that with the fact that they are really lightweight like I mentioned, and that makes these a super solid choice for a pair of traveling headphones. Now on the website, they definitely hype these up a bit. They claim they feature a tasteful zinc alloy matte accent, which is fancy talk for a pretty cool matte finish. Now as far as sound quality goes, they sound really good. Not amazing, I definitely wouldn't take them over a pair of Sony's at say that $100 price point. I think the biggest thing lacking for them is the bass. Most people might feel it needs a little bit more but, if you can only spend 50 bucks for a pair of headphones and you need them to be wireless, I would seriously check these out. So last up, once more I'm gonna hit you with a little bit of that nostalgia. This is the 8bitdo SNES30, which is this really cool little Bluetooth controller that looks just like the original Super Nintendo controller. So this connects wirelessly via Bluetooth, but just in case you're right smack in the middle of a game and your battery starts to die, you can still use this connected to a USB cable as well. Now just like that sweet Ankar keyboard I took a look at earlier, this also works on Mac, Windows, iOS and Android, but more importantly and the reason I'm featuring it today is that it now works with the Nintendo Switch. So with the Switch it makes for a really great retro, throwback companion. You get these really awesome tactile buttons. Now on one side, if you're playing more complex games like Zelda, you probably want to check out their more expensive pro model, which is still under 50 bucks, but on the other hand if you're doing simple games like Mario Cart, this is gonna work perfectly. Now speaking of the Switch, this amazing, custom, Zelda theme Switch, yes this one right here, I am also giving away along with a chance to win everything featured in this video. Details on that are down below. This is Jonathan and I'll catch you guys later.",

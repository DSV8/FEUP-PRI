    "transcript": "Today we're going to get cultured *Sitting up in the chair* Is that a thing you can do, can you get cultured? I'm gonna EXPOSE you to a culture you might not be aware of That is the TEA CULTURE . (I don't know) I'm not gonna do it by myself, I'm gonna bring in big Tea Tom as well It's called \"TEFORIA\" And I, I'm legitimately pumped to Check this out A $1,000 tea machine, or maybe even $1,500. I don't know, I'm gonna link it down below. Something I didn't know is that people are making tea wrong, you included What do you got? You got the hot water, you got the bag? According to these guys that's all wrong You're not bringing out the, the maximum flavor from that tea. Am I gonna be able to tell the difference between a tiny little tea bag that costs a few cents? Is that it? Is it a few cents? How much is a tea bag worth? Twenty tea bags, three dollars. Who, who are you going to ask for your tea data? \"Big Tea\" Tom. I'm gonna compare the two, depending on the type of tea that you put into it, along with an app on your smart phone, determines the perfect temperature and amount, of time to... brew? Is it brew? Infuse the water, with the flavor of the tea leaves. Now tea is a ritual around the world right? England, tea time all the time. China. Japan. It's everywhere. Why is that important? The point is, it's important. And people take it very seriously. And this might be the most serious way t...to take it so, if you got 15 hundred dollars burning a hole in your pocket, this might be the best cup of tea you've ever had in your life. Anyway. *rips box open* Check this out. I feel like this box here might have tea in it, but they also sent over this one. It's got a barcode on it, and you drop this on the top and it instantaneously knows Okay, you've got the-- you've got the Oolong. You're about to get down with the Oolong. And it'll brew it, whatever that is. I don't know, four minutes. Oh, wow! Oh my goodness. [Sniffs] Holy... Look at that. Ancient dragon? 2007?! They have years on them? Is that real? Wisdom and grace. I don't know. What you all been waiting for... Hoho, baby! That's the carafe right? Yeah. A water filter. What's the point in making tea if you don't have nice tasting water? This is your cleaning brush. Whoa. OOOH.. Look at that. I mean, it sure ain't a kettle. The water filter here... Whoa. ...fits in the bottom there like that. OOOO. See, there's a filter in there, once again. And that's because you put loose leaf tea right in here. Line it up. Oh, that's easy. Whoa! So, this just slides in here. It's not going to impact the flavor because the inner wall is made out of glass and even the outside is BPA-free plastic. This is it I think we're ready to go. [Water Pouring] It's the moment you've all been waiting for! It's time, to bring in, our tea expert, \"Big Tea\" Tooom! Step right up! What do you have to say to the people, Tom? Uh-- heh-- I don't have that much to say. Just here to taste some tea. No, no, no... no. Three things they need to know about tea. Three things? Uh, heh. [Faux Irish Accent] The tones and flavors. Okay, maybe I've over estimated Tom's expertise here. But the truth is, he drinks more tea than I do. So that, therefore, makes you today's expert. -Sure Green Tea vs. Green Tea So here we have cheapo green tea. No offense Tetley, alright. I'm sure you guys - you guys are in the game that's fine. And then we got the... super duper machine. Which one are we gonna do first? Let's do cheapo. *unbox and \"big TEA\" Tom sniff* (Both Laughing)! It doesn't smell anywhere near as inviting as that box. -No Alright, you get a bag, I get a bag. Have we ever had tea together before? -Never, no. This is a ceremony, you realize that? -Yeah. So... *Some awkward cheers*. *unbox and \"big TEA\" Tom drink tea* I mean, it tastes like tea. Work it around. Work it around. How would you rate this tea, scale of 1 to 10? -Probably 5. Just 5? It's satisfactory. -Mhmm. Not trying to put anybody down, like this is still-, This is what it is. -Mhmm. Maybe, you go this route, and you turn into a totally different- You enter the next dimension. GREEN BABY! Gen-mai-cha? Genmaicha. Genmaicha! [Machine Chirps] Ooh! Hello, there. Alright, let me open the app. \"About to experience tea like never before.\" So this - this guy actually connects to your wifi and that's how it speaks to the app. [Machine Chirps] Whoa! Ho ho ho. Ohh, baby. This is about a 4 minute process for this particular green tea. Huh -Yeah Okay, makes sense. Whoaaaa. Ooh, baby! I would rather smell that than drink the other one. I mean- -There it goes. Ooh, man, that's potent! It's like, giving a bath. Yeah, there it is. Unbelieveable. The tea will stay warm in here for up to 90 minutes. Oh, man! Here we go. *cheers* *drinking of the expensive tea* *Tom and Unbox awkwardly exchange glances* *More drinking* Yeah. Yeah! -Really. Pfshhh! You? Hey, man! I was expecting a little bit more. Really? Yeah. Aw man, I got things going on in here. I got things happening in here. It's definitely good. SHUT THE F*@# UP! So here's the thing, you're probably saying, \"Lew (Unbox), this is not a fair comparison. You took like, high end, loose leaf tea And you compared it to like, some little, paper bag from the supermarket.\" I agree with you. But the reason a machine like this exists is to completely stop you from having to go through that whole process. T- to take a guy like me who doesn't have the time to become a connoisseur and like put it all in one place. I'm not gonna be drinking something of this caliber if I gotta do it all myself and I'm steeping, and how long and it's... I'm telling you, I'm not a tea guy, but for me like something different happened right there. It's happening in my mouth right now and it continues to happen. Is it a $1500 thing that's happening in my mouth? Maybe not for Tom. A $1500 cup of tea isn't something that's ever going to be a part of their universe. But if it can be, a part of your universe, you might wanna take that trip. You might wanna take that trip.",

    "transcript": "I feel like every time I open my Google propaganda feed I'm greeted with at least one article about how Intel's new drivers have led to a ten thousand percent performance Improvement and how they may be the new Kings of Fine Wine Graphics carding so in today's video I'm gonna test the claims of Intel's fermentation prowess by looking at this Airbus A380 that I bought in China and then we'll also talk about why some recent changes means that for this graphics card at least it doesn't really matter [Music] thank you today we're looking at the Gunner Photon A380 which is like an upmarket version of the very not upmarket graphics card you can get one of these for 150 US dollars but you can get labor versions of the A380 for 120 dollars which makes a lot more sense price wise to me although for the additional outlay you do get a metal backplate very nice and there's like a lighting thing here that changes color based on stuff although if you have a closer look at the cooler you can see there's nothing particularly fancy going on here we've got this block of aluminum with slats cut into it as opposed to a more traditional fin design and we only have one heat pipe that I can see although it should be more than enough for this A380 which is quite a low TDP despite the eight pin connector on it this card only draws about 75 Watts now in terms of specs the A380 looks like the budget GPU that it very much is although it has one advantage over its price comparable competition it's got six gigs of video memory which is by no means the kind of number you can use to Peacock at a nightclub but at least it's not 4 gigs but on that note it's fire up the A380 with some old ass drivers on it to get some baseline performance hey would you look at that the power cable actually matches the graphics card fancy now the first thing I guess is to see if the graphics card actually works because I couldn't get it to post in that system in China so let's see okay there we go driver-wise 3490 seems to be the oldest one available on Intel's site so I guess we'll use that for our Baseline run let's give it a try now obviously we're starting off with GTA 5 I bet none of you saw that coming oh um okay well I was I was briefly impressed there and then we walked outside and we we dropped to below 60 frames per second now this is at 1080p High settings so perhaps yeah perhaps this isn't too bad I don't know I was I was kind of expecting this all to go worse I guess than it is currently going uh but this is without a framework of reference right so we will in a bit compare it to a similarly priced Nvidia GPU and obviously we also need to try the newer drivers but with that let's let's try someone else wow Battlefield 5 at 1080p medium is running a lot better than GTA 5 was which is pretty weird to see I guess we're just experiencing the super inconsistent performance in the flesh here also look at that low power draw I'm gonna be brave and try medium this this stuff happening you know it's it's playable and whatever this is pretty cool although I shouldn't be too excited about this it could be terrible for the price but before I compare this GPU to a similarly priced and video graphics card let's try a couple newer games but that's unfortunately where my testing for the old drivers had to end because the newer games like Resident Evil 4 but again for some reason and Last of Us Part One also but again didn't want to work so let's see what Nvidia has to offer for this price thank you [Music] now luckily for the A380 Nvidia gave up on this space a long long time ago so all it has to do is compete with the GTX 1630 the graphics card equivalent of a ringworm so even with the older drivers I don't think it's going to be very hard for it but let's find out oh that's quite the humiliation for the A380 we're actually getting better performance out of the 1630 which wow yeah that's that's a bit rough but this is an older game that's something that terrifies the A380 so maybe Battlefield will be different you see there you go with Battlefield 5 the A380 manages to curb stop the 78 year old Schnauzer with arthritis we're comparing it to the A380 really has some wild performance variance between titles wow the same thing goes for cyberpunk we're still doing 1080p medium settings and despite having a higher power drill forever it's like way lower yeah I don't know even with the older drivers when it comes to newer games the A380 really is showing them the little 16 City who's boss here although again that is kind of like out running a sloth with no legs [Music] Owen would you look at that last of us remaster actually launches uh although it's a bit of an unfair comparison considering that the drivers that we used for the A380 That Couldn't launch the game were much older than the game so I think that makes sense even at low settings that is not looking good for the 1630. I mean considering what the settings were telling us I was expecting significantly worse performance than the 24 frames per second that we are getting here so in all fairness to the 1630 this is kind of impressive again very good sign oh would you look at that Resident Evil 4 is actually kind of playable at low settings again despite the fear-mongering of the settings it doesn't feel great mind you but it's a 1650 what do you expect but now comes the exciting part of the video we're gonna whip out this disappointment of the graphics card and see if fermentation has happened with the Intel drivers foreign [Music] the new driver interface looks a lot better and you can actually click around it without it crashing which is a very good Improvement although I do think they fixed that a while ago but they did overhaul the interface again since the last time I used an Intel GPU although I quickly noticed there was still something missing so they still don't have a hotkey option for screen capture how have they not added that yet oh wow that's made a huge difference it's night and day in the standardized benchmarks we got a whole extra average frame rate after a year of driver development that's very good I also changed it to DX 10.1 which also didn't make a difference I don't know I think maybe GTA 5 may be Intel GPU Kryptonite it's really starting to look that way now before I look at some newer games I did also test CS go which benefit a huge amount from the driver updates you can see here old driver it's a stuttery mess and then it's smooth with the new drivers look at that silky frame time graph and this Improvement in my opinion is extremely important because it makes the very popular dx9 based Esports titles way more playable on the A380 but what about the rest of the games we tested if I didn't know any better I'd say that this is still the same drivers we're using although in all fairness to the fermentation we did get a healthy bump in one percent lows which is not insignificant that is that is something that makes the game feel smoother okay more of the same although with the next two games the drivers may make an infinite difference to the performance if they actually run a Last of Us is actually running now and it's running better than the 1630 Runner which again is not a magnificent accomplishment but it's better and better is better you know wow now that Resident Evil 4 is running it's kind of running the crap out of it so we got some positive improvements it's good but unfortunately none of that matters at least for the A380 because due to some recent changes you can now for the price of a couple of Big Macs ish more when compared to the photon card get an RX 6600 an Intel can up the A380 drivers until they're blue in the face but either way it's getting pushed in by one of those oh no poor little A380 that is almost three times the frame rate [Music]",

    "transcript": "so far in the series of videos where I realize I'm not nearly as good at driving as I thought we've looked at racing some setups from near the bottom of the barrel somehow this stand is managing to be worse than the steering wheel the mid-range used market and in today's video we're going to have a look at the high end namely this monstrosity I'm currently sitting in but we still have a little bit of climbing to do before we get here [Music] now it's impossible to talk about oil Baron type Sim racing without mentioning direct drive which as we discussed in the previous video apparently is the best way to connect like a fake steering wheel to a motor to have it feel the most carry and I'm real curious to see if it's as much a step up from the other options as people say luckily a company that makes the direct drive basis MOZA reached out and was kind enough to send a whole variety of direct drive stuff in today's video we're going to be looking at an entry-level direct drive set and something quite a bit more high-end but the steering wheel bit and the pedals isn't the whole story when it comes to oil Baron Sim racing the way that you mount that stuff is equally important so that it can really feel like you're sitting in a real car and one of the companies that makes awesome cockpits giggity track racer also reached out and sent over a real wild setup for us to mount all of our direct driess to to have it feel real badass but before we get to that let's have a look at an entrylevel direct drive set ooh with direct drive bases one of the main specs you gauge their worthiness with is Peak torque output which basically tells you to what extent the motor can rip your arms off the R5 has 5.5 new M Peak torque which handily amount mascul Ates the very popular Logitech G29 from the previous video's poultry 2.1 Newt M ooh that's a real chubby gripped Little Wheel it feels good I like that wo that's so heavy it's all metal you can feel that there's a pretty serious motor in here on the back there's a whole bunch of connections for pedals handbrakes all kinds of stuff and then finally the all metal pedals which I'm kind of struggling to get into the shot here which oh what's really cool about them is you can change the position of the pedals along this base plate and you can buy a separate clutch pedal to add to this generally the MOZA ecosystem is extremely modular and upgradeable which is nice with that let's set it up and after very pretty much not being confused by the software installation and setup process I was ready the first thing I've noticed before even putting the wheel on is that the pedals do not like carpet very much they really want to be mounted to a rig cuz it's it's not very stable oh game force feedback intensity let's put it on 50% but before racing Could Happen Aseto Corsa needed its own setup procedure before playing nice with the mosa kit oh it's so smooth and there's like very interesting feeling bumps and stuff so this is at 50% power oh so many little bumps Everything feels so much clearer through the steering wheel because you can't feel the mechanism naturally I then turned up the power oh you can really feel the road the way you feel the like Wheels lock up is really crazy like when you break real hard oh W wo there's so much detail and after a whole lot more pleasure moaning while driving over some grass I decided to try some terrible drifting instead this feels so different oh oh damn this feels so different to the G29 a you can instantly feel the additional power which I'm not really used to to having to deal with yeah really need to get used to it but it feels so much better I then decided to try my hand at some beam andng which was immediately terrifying oh this is like table destroying stuff going on here oh my word despite turning the force feedback down it was still going ham I love how quietly this thing just destroys your desk oh that's so much feedback it's almost gratuitous to be honest this is how you drive a pickup right right oh no no it's all broken ah we're drifting our pickup truck in a field in Italy very exciting it is busy tearing the desk apart but that's part of the the realism yeah it looks like it's doing pretty well we've lost some windows but that's to be expected oh yeah the these are not the correct settings to be using this wheel with it feels like I'm driving on a teenager's face here I then went back into the settings to see if I could tame the Beast which was better until it wasn't it's way better now I then discovered the game specific setting presets in MOZA's pitous software those setting changes made it a lot angrier if anything this is the R5 as well there's an R16 waiting for me in a box over there I'm just going to destroy my wrists with it I have driven an old car and it does kind of feel like this I'm not going to lie like it does it does feel like you're wrestling a bear in the way that this feels I understand now why something like an R16 doesn't come with a desk Mount because it would rip this desk apart oh oh oh waa having survived another violent crash I decided to try and mount the R5 base to the stand I got with my used setup from the previous video which despite the fact that the mounting plate of the stand looks like it took some buck shot to the face still needed me to drill extra holes for mounting the base and the pedals so mounting compatibility is really something to pay attention to I also added the awesome brake upgrade for the SRP light pedals which gives it a lot firmer brake feel finally having the R5 mounted to something a bit sturdier made a huge difference the pedals weren't walking around anymore and beam and G crashes weren't nearly as harrowing anymore at least that's what I initially thought oh oh oh terrible things happened what oh oh no let me please change the oh my god oh there's so much vibration oh Jesus but with that let's get to the big boy gear so we can see how much more you get for quite a long more money track racer really went to town this I don't even think this is half of it the all so heavy lots of metal and stuff happening it kind of seems like I'm building an actual car today now this is all of it and by all of it I mean just the Trak Racer stuff this doesn't include any of the MOZA gear yet I am so excited to build this bewildered by the massive boxes I just open opened all of it and hoped that the way forward would somehow make itself clear either way it quickly became obvious this was a serious piece of kit that thing is one piece where does is that like the stand that holds the holy crap and then under that is a slightly less obscenely massive piece luckily the instructions were very clear even for an idiot like me and soon things were starting to make sense I find the way the assembly Works fascinating you've got these huge pieces of extrude aluminum with these grooves in them and then you have these little threaded ball bearings which slots into the groove in the metal with the bowl bearing holding it in place and you can move it using that and you can kind of set it anywhere along there and then screw what the thing is that you need to screw down into it that's a really smart way to make a system like this very modular I then spent the next two days with a couple Allen keys and a whole bunch of elbow grease screwing until my eyes watered I just wasn't prepared for how physically demanding building this Frame would be but at the same time deeply satisfying this is easily one of the most obscene things I've looked at on the channel thus far I am super excited to finish it uh I'm pretty close I'm actually at the point where I need to start whipping out all of the mosa stuff so that we can get the mounting in order for that now when it comes to the other MOZA stuff we have not just a round steering wheel but it's a full-sized round steering wheel it's a 13in in diameter one which is nice and thick and then in terms of pedals they sent over their SRP racing pedals uh we also have a clutch for it they're very similar to the SRP light for the the other setup but the breake on this this has an actual load cell in it which instead of using the angle of the brake pedal to determine how much input you're giving the load cell measures the force you're putting on the pedal and it apparently feels a lot more like a real breake pedal and finally MOZA's monstrous R16 base the R5 has Peak torque output of 5.5 newm whereas this has a wrist shattering 16 strong enough to murder a small child but what I find more interesting is the higher bit encoder in the R16 which gives it almost 10 times as many points of detail over the rotation of the wheel back oh wa that is absurdly heavy oh oh look at that thing it's metal I mean that thing feels like it's made out of solid uranium it is so sturdy feeling the physics defying density of the R16 did make mounting a little bit of a hassle however mounting the pedals was the real struggle because of all of the mounting holes on the plate which you very much need for Universal compatibility but finding the correct alignment for your pedals is like playing a where's Waldo game designed by Satan I ended up taking the plate off and mounting it to the back of the pedals but then it turns out that some of the screws that MOZA gave weren't long enough to make it through the industrial strength base and by the time I bought long enough screws and mounted the seat I is exhausted oh I can finally sit in it oh this is a crazy device the next challenge was dialing in the steering wheel angle first I tried swapping to a front mount which would let me get the steering wheel lower without impeding leg room but infuriatingly the track racer front mount wasn't compatible with the mosa base and the mosa front mount wasn't compatible with the Trak Racer stand so I had to remount the 100 ton R16 to the top mount but use MOZA's extension Rod to get it low and far enough back so my knees had room but once I attached the monitor mount the three day construction process of This Magnificent Beast was finally [Music] done [Music] oh that feels remarkably like you're sitting in a real car which is very cool uh I also like how adjustable this thing is although having said that it is the most effort ever to adjust anything on it it feels like moving a Mountain every time just cuz of how heavy everything is and how many bolts it all requires I am super excited to give it a try so let's fire it up as was the case with the R5 we had to tweak the crap out of the settings before we could get going but at the moment I have the base set at 40% power which should put it just a little bit more powerful than the R5 at max power that feels so much like it's attached to a real car oh it feels really different there's a lot more like variability in the type of feedback that it gives you so you have this like really smooth tug that it gives when you can feel the weight transfer of the car but then there's lots of tiny texture detail when you hit a curb you can feel the weight of the car really well with this wheel let's turn the intensity up a bit and see what that does oh that 10% made a big big difference at 50% it's it's already scary like this is really strong that's a frisky sounding car I like that one of the things that I really like about these direct drive bases is that you can clearly feel the character of the different cars next a quick jump to 55% power and a terrifying old Lamborghini oh it's so heavy oh oh it really wanted to to kill me there I guess if you're a gorilla you'd be really excited by it how strong this is then I put on my big boy pants and cranked it up to 70 no way no way and finally I tried something even scarier than the mural which went well oh oh we've locked up come on turn into the corner oh I feel like I'm going to injure myself this isn't fun anymore no we Vlog okay it does actually save you the crash impact I was S I was about to lose my life there my word now I've changed my seating position slightly I've reclined the chair like one set down and it feels way more comfy now wao what the R5 with this pickup truck you're like wrestling it whereas here it's so like soft and floaty look at that and this is at 50% so I think this is like 8 new M we're at but beam G's violence quickly reared its ugly head okay what about ah oh okay you don't want to hit a curb clearly oh that's cool so you use the joysticks to like look around oh no oh it it really makes you not want to crash the force feedback is a lot angrier in BeamNG oh and the moment you touch the accelerator in a corner with this thing it's over oh lock up oh please stop locking up okay we're good I then decided to switch tactics from baboon to 80-year-old retired dentist fourth gear there we go that's nice and peaceful fifth nothing terrifying happening here at all keep it between 2 and 3,000 RPM otherwise you're stressing the engine is my driving instructor would always say this is so boring oh my God I need to oh yeah locking up that's that's got me excited again the arousal is back very good now we're on a a really small Road and you know what they say the smaller the road the more forgiving it is for gorilla Behavior see this is fine this is safe what we're doing here 100 oh the the ramps feel oh oh oh no things are oh oh I'm so scared I want to go that was a mistake I don't know this motor somehow manages to shake this whole frame I I don't know how it does it because this Frame weighs several times what I do uh but it is yeah it's it's an angry [Music] thing now after that amazing beam and G showing I have been comparing this crazy R16 setup to the R5 bundle we looked at earlier for the last week and this Behemoth rig is awesome but its performance depends quite a lot on the game you're playing because if the game has terrible driving physics you don't benefit from the epicness as much with a setto Corsa for example with its amazing driving physics there's almost an eerie sense of the wheel being connected to a real car there's so much detail and communication through the steering wheel don't get me wrong aeto Corsa feels great through the R5 as well but it's kind of like going from 1080p to 1440p if that makes sense whereas beam and G's physics is violent I think is the only way I can describe that but then when you get to a game like dirt rally 2 the driving feedback is so much more muted than the other games and I didn't feel nearly as big a difference between the R5 and the R16 in games like that and the mosa stuff doesn't have official console support yet uh there is an unofficial way to get it working there's like a little device you can buy which I will try out at some point but as of now you can't plug a console into the L MOA gear which does limit your games Library further and the main difference the frame makes is proper driving position which is awesome adjustability and sturdiness the fact that you can just lay into the brake pedal without something shifting around gives you a real sense of confidence which brings me to the value discussion now earlier in the video I did tell you what all of the mosa kit costs uh the combination is about $1,400 but we haven't discussed the track racer frames price yet now the frame I'm sitting in now is is called the TR 160s which costs $750 but that's just the base cost of the frame you still need to add a chair a monitor amount if you want that there's a whole bunch of accessories you can add to it which is pretty cool I like the modularity but it gets expensive quick with all the accessories this setup is about $1,400 which with the mosa pricing is almost $33,000 not including the monitor that's just for the Sim racing stuff which is quite a lot of money but track racer and Mosa's ecosystems are both very modular so offer a great upgrade PA so you can start with like the R5 bundle for $460 which I feel like is very good value for money the Logitech g923 which is their current Gear Drive base sells for about $400 and the R5 is way better than that so that's like very good value for money and if you add that onto a more budget rig or even a half stand which track racer also has and those half frames are really good if space is an issue I feel like that is where the price to Performance kind of peak is when it comes to sim racing stuff but if you're like a Saudi Prince and you really like Sim racing or you've been slowly upgrading a rig for ages getting to this point is real awesome if you play a setto Corsa with that I've just been having so much fun with this Clinging On for de life as you wrestle an old Lotus Formula 1 car around the nurur ring is an intensely physical experience and I love it so much the next step is definitely VR cuz I think that'll easily Elevate this experience to something underwear destroying I think that that is going to be mindblowing considering the tactility of all of these peripherals so subscribe if you want to see that and until the next video thank you very much for watching thank you mosa and track racer for sending over this awesome stuff and until the next video [Music] bye-bye",

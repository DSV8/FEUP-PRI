    "transcript": "- Hey guys, Jonathan here from YouTube.com/tld here with the Superfied Talk, got some very special guests the one and only Sara Dietschy - Oh you can't do that! I was ready to do the hey guys, this is Austin - He mixed it up. - Wait your turn. - Hey guys. - It's okay, you can do it. - And always lovely, Austin Evans. Today we are talking AI, where it's at with smartphones, where it's head of the future and potentially how it could affect love and relationships. So as I, from your perspective, what would be one thing you would want that would be helpful on a relationship level. - On a relationship level, probably you know I think it could offer insights in terms of the other human you know, so say you're in a relationship and maybe they had some bad emails come through some bad text messages maybe the phones kind of gaging their emotional state and then the significant other gets a notification Hey, you gotta, kind of like tip toe around your other person's feelings today cause they had a rough one. - Okay I take back everything I said before, this is amazing I need this in my life. - Right? I feel like it would save relationships. - It's like having a real assistant, right? Like not like something just super basic but like imagine having an actual friend to be over your shoulder like hey you don't see this but you're messing up in a big way. Pay attention and obviously that's a little bit over the top and obviously your phone is not going to be like that person yet but you can kind of see like as things sort of start developing that there's that sort of potential that it could actually be something that's super useful in life. - So in nut shell, hopefully it's gonna save - Relationships everywhere. - Everywhere. - Yes, I'm just gonna rely on the phone to be thoughtful for me. - You might fall in love with the phone, there might not have to be another significant other. - Yeah that kind of got me thinking right there when you talked about about how it's reading your messages and emails like - Yeah - In a weird way it's gonna know that you had a bad day right? (laughing) - It's the best personal assistant. - Or hey, maybe you're texting this person, calm down. - Well, I never thought about that but talking in terms of relationships and love-life and stuff, you know maybe your phone can give you red flags or something. - Like, are you sure you want to say that? No no no that's a bad idea. (laughing) - Yeah yeah yeah, it can give you some advice, some dating advice. - It kind of works like that to a degree right now because I mean when you go to open up a text or something it will start to sort of auto fill what you're going to say and it's like oh right, don't say that, you're an idiot. You know, like there's some things that like you can start with but then you imagine as it gets smarter and smarter and it really knows like oh this is the relationship with this person... - More personalized - Yeah exactly, it's just like hey, remind that this is your birthday or this is an anniversary or something like it can actually be proactive and be thoughtful when you aren't, although I'm always thoughtful, don't worry about that part. It's not for me, it's for other people who aren't thoughtful. - Right right. - I'm gonna bet that you're going to get the notifications that say, Hey bring flowers home. - No, never. I don't know what you're talking about. But it's cool to think that as technology gets better and better that there's all these possibilities that open up just as the tech that we use every day gets smarter and smarter. - And I think it's about enhancing real life to where it's not all about phone phone phone, but it's how can we take this technology, bring it to the real world, how can it enhance your love life. - It's like when you're on a date and it's like hey, get off your phone. - Exactly. - Like don't look at me anymore. (laughing) That would be a great idea. - That's gonna be the savior right there. So I'm excited to see where it heads in the future with that We just talked about AI, and I got a surprise. - A surprise? Oh boy. Tell me more. - Close your eyes. - Okay. - Don't close your eyes. - Ooh, I think I know what this is. - What is it? - It is the Honor V10. - Now word on the street is this is packing some power inside. - Yeah, well it's got the Kirin 970 processor, which I'm about to go totally into nerd town but it's really cool, so not only is it a powerful processor in sort of the traditional sense but it has a dedicated neural processing unit which essentially means that there's machine learning built in, stop looking at me like that, you know this gets me excited, this is cool stuff okay? So what it's doing, it's actually not only it gives you some cool features which we'll probably talk about in a minute but also it is learning right? So the idea is not only is it powerful and doing a lot today but it's only going to get better as time goes on as it just learns more and more about what you do it's more app supportive, there's just a lot of interesting stuff that it's going to be able to do. - Now what I think is cool is if you imagine it in the work environment so say your team all had these in their pocket. - So the idea that everyone has an actual smart assistant to help them kind of not be late to work or remember to text me when you're coming in late to work. - Or maybe in a situation where you're out on production in a different country maybe - And you have the actual translation? - Yeah so I've been in situations where you have to do interviews or meetings and sometimes it's a little hard to communicate when you don't know that language. And I know you like, you're always all over the place. - Yeah I mean I think you know all of us make videos and we make videos across the world and so it's super exciting to take that power of the processor and really have it come in ways it's super practical. I mean Austin let's say that you are a Spanish YouTuber that I'm about to interview but I don't speak Spanish so how am I going to ask you that question? - I don't either! Why do I have to be Spanish YouTube? - We'll see. We'll see. So I'm going to say in English the question and hopefully it will translate to Spanish and then we'll test out your Spanish Austin. - Hey Austin, when did you start making videos? (Spanish translation) Oh no, that's cheating though. You got to say it. - So the Spanish words are now on the screen, Austin you are the Spanish YouTuber. Read that out to us. - Hey Austin, (foreign language) - You know what? Because I don't know Spanish, I'm gonna say great job. And it's taking, I think AI has a lot to do with taking data and taking so much information and really packing it into something that people can understand. And so especially you know, we make videos, we collaborate with people, I think bringing that into like the workplace with collaboration saying oh, this person can't make it, maybe your calendar updates and depending on other information it makes new plans. - And the idea that having something smart that opens up so many possibilities right? Where it's like you might not necessarily think like oh let me connect this dot with that dot but the phone's like oh, I know this is what you're doing I know this is who you're talking to like the more information it knows when it actually has some intelligence behind it it can sort of connect a lot of dots to make your life easier in a lot of ways that you might not necessarily think of. - Yeah exactly. - I was going to say, you haven't collabed with Austin Evans in two years or in my case, it's going to say you collabed with Austin like seven times. - Just stop. Like every time you collab I see your subscriber numbers drop, this is a terrible idea. It's like when the Austin mode on the camera shows up it's like EH, there's like a giant X on my face. (laughing) Yeah man, it's smart. - We're talking AI, entertainment, gaming, traveling. Maybe even some selfies. - I do a few of those. Maybe not selfies, but I do all the other things all the time. When you actually have AI on board with gaming right, so of course you need a powerful processor to be able to game properly but there's also some other cool stuff that you can actually take advantage of. So if I actually pull up a game here, well the cool thing here is that if I jump into it you'll see that not only does it take up the full screen but say I get a notification or something right now, while I'm in the middle of my game I don't want to die because mom texted me asking for milk or something, so what you can do is, Hey it happens okay? - [Jonathan] Hey, two percent or whole? - Whole! Two percent. Pshh. - Hey I don't know what your mom likes. - Well it's like there's only so health like you don't need to be that healthy in life. That's all I'm trying to say. But yeah so you can actually game and not have to deal with notifications or whatever, the phone is smart enough to know, oh look this is what I'm doing, I'm gaming, I don't want to be interrupted. Mom just give me like five more minutes, it's fine. And what's also cool is that because this has such a large battery we're getting about a day and a half of usage, but almost more importantly than that, say you're gaming all day, gotta hit that charger, for like 20 minutes you can supercharge the battery up to like a full day of usage. So you're pretty much not, you're unstoppable. - Quit gaming man, we're not going to get anything done. We gotta go to selfies. - No no no, it's work okay. - Sara, take it away. - Okay well, the thing that makes a good picture I think is something that resembles some maybe more expensive cameras, you have DSLRs, you know, they are really good about blurring the background, which is called Bokeh. And so with this, it uses AI to really detect where are the edges with the face, it separates the person and the background and I would like to demonstrate that with a selfie. Alright so we're going to take a selfie here, see the background is already pretty blurred, okay smile Austin! - You got me didn't you? - Perfect. And see? Oh and see, it even got the blur around Jon's fingers. - Yeah, the way it should be. - Yes, yes. It separates us from the background, um yeah? That's a pretty darn good picture. And so not only do you have that in this camera, but you can take your selfies, Superfie them, make them look beautiful. - So clearly beautiful selfies are not a problem but also, there's some love on the rear cameras too. We got of them here, 16 and 20 mega pixels, and what's cool is we got a beautiful F1.8 aperture. - Which makes not only better photos but especially when it comes to low light, it allows you to gather a lot more light in, cause I feel like with a lot of smart phones you're in like a restaurant or some sort of dim area and you're like, Hey let's take a picture! Oh ooh. But actually having that aperture makes a big difference. Plus having the secondary camera means that you actually have more to pull from. - There you go so whether it's selfies, rear facing cameras, low light, gaming, love life, becoming a creator of the next Austin Evans, this is where it's taking you. Thank you Austin Evans, thank you Sara, and we'll catch you guys later after we - Fight to the death. - That's like straight for the neck man! - Right at the jugular, you're dead. Later, you're dead!",

    "transcript": "In this video I'm going to show you how to make a DSLR ring light. Because it surrounds the lens, it lights the subject in a way that's soft and flattering. This can help give your footage a glamour look, and the creative possibilities are endless. To build one you'll need 20 10w 32v LEDs. These are pretty inexpensive, and you can find a link to them in the description. You'll also need some paperclips, a set of pin connectors, some twin stranded wire, a battery holder, a clear cd from the bottom of a stack of disks, and an old lens filter that's the right thread for your camera's lens. Additionally you'll also need a voltage booster, a link to which is in the description. Tool wise you'll need a soldering iron and solder, pliers, glue, and a knife. Holding clips would be pretty helpful as well. So the first thing to do is straighten out your paperclips with a pair of pliers. Once they're straightened, arrange your 20 leds in a circle, and bend the paperclips so that they match the inside edge of your ring of LEDs. If done correctly, the inside edge should be just slightly smaller than the size of a CD. Once you've curved all your paperclips, you can then solder them together to create a ring. Note that not all paperclips are good for soldering, so if the solder isn't flowing on very easily, you may want to try a different brand. After checking that your ring is the correct size, you can start soldering the LEDs to it. LEDs need to be wired up the correct way around, so take a close look at the polarity markings on each bulb before you solder them on. The negative side is marked with a negative symbol, so solder its corresponding tab to the inner ring you just made. Do this for the remaining LEDs and you should have something that looks like this. Now its time to make the outer paperclip ring, so straighten out some more paperclips and solder them to the outer edge. The ring needs to be able to screw on to the camera's lens, so take a lens filter of the right size and remove its inner element by unscrewing it. Using some blu tac to keep it from moving, place the now empty filter on to the centre of a cd and trace around it several times with a sharp knife. Once you've made a fairly heavy groove, flip it around and do the same to the other side, making sure that the groove is reasonably deep and that you don't slip. You should now be able to push out the inner part of the cd. If it doesn't come out easily, deepen the grooves and try again. Now insert the lens filter. If it's to tight a fit, widen the hole using sand paper until the lens filter slides in easily. You can now glue the filter permanently to the CD. With the filter's thread facing backwards, glue the ring of LEDs to the outer rim of the CD. Once it's all dry, solder two short lengths of wire to both the outer ring and the inner ring. Flip the light around so it's facing downwards and solder these two wires to the output of the voltage booster. Make sure you get the polarity correct or else the LEDs won't light up. Now solder the male pin connector to the input side of the voltage booster, with the red wire going to the positive terminal, and the black wire going to the negative terminal. Now glue the voltage regulator to the back of the CD. Whilst it dries, get your battery holder and extend the wires by using a length of twinned wire. Use some tape to prevent the wires from shoring out. On the end of this extension solder on the other pin connector, making sure that the red wire connects to the positive side of the battery pack. Again, add some tape to make sure that the wires don't short out. Now connect the pin connectors together - take care to make sure that you connect them the right way around, so red to red and black to black. Your LEDs should now light up, but if not it may be because your voltage regulator is set to the wrong voltage, so rotate the variable resistor on the voltage regulator until it reaches at least 24v. Now there's only one thing left to do, which is to find the brightness sweet spot. As the LEDs are designed to work with heat sinks, it's possible for them to overheat without them. So what you need to do is adjust the voltage so that the LEDs remain cool enough to touch. If you can't keep your finger on them for 5 seconds, then the voltage is too high, so dial it down until you can keep your fingers on the LEDs for at least 10 seconds. For me this value was 25v.",

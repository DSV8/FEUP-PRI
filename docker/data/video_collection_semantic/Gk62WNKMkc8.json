    "transcript": "- [Michael] As Mr. Mobile, I've covered electric and hybrid cars from Tesla to Toyota, and on my last day at CES 2018, I test drove an EV unlike any I'd seen before. I'm Michael Fisher, and this is the Electra Meccanica SOLO. An electric car built for one. (upbeat music) Okay, if the first word out of your mouth when you saw this thumbnail was, \"why?\" Well, the pitch from Electra Meccanica is basically this, savings. Both in carbon footprint and fuel costs. I only had a half hour with the SOLO at CES so I can't confirm anything yet, but I do have some early thoughts, and given how tiny this thing is, a half hour was more than enough for a walk around, and, a quick run around the block. The car I drove wasn't quite production quality. There were some panel gaps that were wider than they will be on the final model, and I was missing a few creature comforts like fine temperature control for the cabin. Otherwise though, this is mostly what buyers will be getting. A micro sized electric car with truck space, both, behind and in front of the cabin, a 16 kilowatt hour lithium ion battery, and 82 horsepower electric motor driving the single rear wheel. Now, if you're thinking that makes this more enclosed trike than proper car, you've got a solid argument. In fact, here in the States, it's certified under safety rules governing motorcycles. So, no air bags in either the steering wheel or the roof pillars, which are instead covered in a carpet-like fabric. In my quick putter around the Las Vegas Convention Center, I was surprised at how much driving the SOLO felt like driving any other car. After I got used to using a three way switch for a gear shift and relying on side mirrors and a back-up camera instead of a rear-view, the SOLO was very comfortable. With a rated zero to sixty in eight seconds and a software limited top speed of about 80 miles an hour, it's no dragster, but it felt zippy enough. While you are rather low to the road, the feeling is more like driving a Miata than motorcycle, until, of course, you wanna bring a guest along. Oh and uh, get ready for some attention from passers-by. - Oh, I don't know, we'll see. (laughs) I'm trying to secure a longer session to give the SOLO a proper review, but until then, here's what I like. The hundred mile range and three to six hour top up time, depending on what voltage you're plugged into. The simple driving experience that any car driver can understand. Power windows, keyless entry, and a Bluetooth stereo system, and the tiny, tiny footprint that should make parking a breeze. I'm not so crazy about the recessed, and rather small, dashboard display. I'm not sure how I'd feel surrounded by big rigs on a highway in something this small. It's so tiny. And I don't like that air conditioning is an option that'll cost an extra thousand bucks. Speaking of dollars, the SOLO starts at $15,500. If you wanna reserve one it'll cost a refundable 250 bucks, and you should expect delivery around the fourth quarter 2018. As someone who values mobility and considers electric cars the future, I find the SOLO, intriguing. I'll hold my final recommendation until I'm able to spend more than a half hour in the thing, but tell me what you think. Electra Meccanica has data that says 90% of drivers ride alone, most of the time. If you're one of them, could a car like this find a place in your life?

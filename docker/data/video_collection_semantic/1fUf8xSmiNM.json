    "transcript": "it's that time of year again where seemingly every gaming laptop's on sale so i bought one that seemed almost too good to be true for the price just to see what kind of deals are out there at the moment but before we check it out it's time for a word from today's video sponsor after a long hard day at work i like to soothe my brow with a steaming hot couple of note there's just nothing quite like a good reliable linux based cloud computing service for all your web hosting and computational needs top it off with industry leading customer support and you've got a winner try the node today and new accounts get a hundred dollar sixty day credit lenode now this laptop cost me the equivalent of about 715 us dollars and for that you get an intel 12 700h which is already ridiculous for the price a 512 gig ssd eight gigs of ram which i guess we can't really complain about it at this price hopefully it's not that difficult to fix we'll figure that out later in the video we also get an rtx 3050 ti which doesn't mean a whole lot but again we'll investigate later on and we also get a 1080p high refresh rate ips display so unless this laptop's like a violent test spot or summon it's probably a great deal so let's open it up and find out we've got some blue gamer accents nice that is a perfectly reasonable 170 watt power brick it's quite wide but it's relatively thin and light and then on this end we have the mickey mouse ears now the first impressions are of turtle death this is a real plasticy boy which at this price point isn't a big deal and it's very robust feeling plastic oh yeah that is a real sturdy feeling laptop and one of the things that i quite like about the plain plastic build of it is that it doesn't make me feel like a gross cheesy ogre every time i touch it in the way that an aluminium device like a macbook makes me feel but that could just be my low self-esteem talking there's also a whole bunch of ventilation on this laptop which really gets my juices flowing now when it comes to the i o you've got square usb ports on either side of the laptop and then there are some more goodies on the back oh very effectively passes the one hand open test it's got one of those webcam privacy shield things that lenovo puts on a lot of their devices uh we've got reasonably thin bezels around the display but this kind of chunk down here doesn't look that great i'd say that that's like a mid to low tier laptop keyboard it's a bit rattly very unsatisfying keystrokes but it's quite nicely laid out we've even got a numpad for all of you excel enthusiasts out there and we've got full sized arrow keys very nice trackpad is quite plasticky but it's a nice size and the click is okay on it now the hinge has a nice weighting to it and you can see it actually goes really low but it is quite floppy look at that although yeah that's fine it's not too bad in terms of practical use but when you do open it up and move it around yeah it is a bit floppy a final thing that i do notice is that the speakers are downward facing which i absolutely hate when laptops do but anyway with that let's see how easy it is to open up this laptop and upgrade that abominable ram configuration now having a look at the base of this laptop it's not very promising i mean is a glory hall really that much to ask for on the base of a laptop just a panel to remove so you can easily access the insides hopefully it doesn't feel as brutal to open as that asus laptop i looked at a while ago let's let's see can see there's a very thin gap that you need to get a tool in and that's pretty brittle feeling plastic oh this back bit slowly starting to come off as well so do i need to oh so there are two screw screws on the back here as well that i think you need to undo oh that is an unpleasant sound oh that's a bit sneaky we've got another two screws hiding under here keeping this plate in if there's solder drama under here i'm gonna be so pissed oh what it's even attached to the hinge back here so there's an additional couple screws wow this laptop really makes you work for the teardown but it hasn't felt quite as destructive as the asus laptop i looked at a while ago so i guess that's good because now that it's actually loose we can just kind of lift it off and then there is the inside of our 700-ish dollar laptop that little thin plate better not be hiding ram solder crimes now once you've got the top off uh it's quite interesting in here we've got what looks like four heat pipes and there's quite a lot of cooling surface area actually the first thing we need to do is disable the battery there is actually a little bit of tape that keeps the ram cover down i don't know that feels like one of those if tampered with warranty will be void kind of things we've got going on here and you can just undo it like that i guess and then oh good it's just a single stick of ram which is not really something you want in a gaming laptop but at least you can upgrade it which is very good and at this price you can't really complain about eight gigs i'm not sure how 12th gen intel laptop cpus respond to single channel ram so we'll definitely upgrade that later in the video and see what effect that has but this could be quite a knee to the groin of that cpu's performance that is a thick thermal pad damn wow that is a fat boy thermal pad which kind of just contacts the plastic back of the laptop i think it kind of touches over here i don't know how useful that's going to be but you know it is there it's the thought that counts i guess generally for the price that is a very acceptable laptop interior i'm glad that there's some upgradeability here i do wish that it was easier to get into but you can always make a laptop easier to get into at least it doesn't feel like you're breaking apart the universe when you open it so yeah i'm gonna reassemble it and then we're gonna try to do some gaming on it that almost looks like one of those ai generated images to me now when we go to all apps we've got geforce experience on here some lenovo stuff which i guess is expected oh we've got mcafee live safe that's a crowd favorite right there nahimic oh okay so that's like for the for the audio on the laptop yeah i mean it's not the worst i've seen but it's it's definitely not vd-free you know here is our savage single stick of ddr4 which is actually running at its rated speed out of the box which is nice and considering that this is a ddr4 12th gen laptop it'll be nice and cheap to upgrade now with gta 5 running at 1080p high settings it's not running as well as i was expecting here although when we look closer we can see that the gpu and the cpu aren't doing a whole lot which means the culprit is most likely the ram configuration as is always the case but don't worry we'll test that later on in the video uh in terms of temperatures though it's pretty good and it's not that jet turbine you know it's it's definitely audible but it could be a whole lot worse that yeah just look at that utilization uh but having said that it runs fine you know usually with this kind of kneecapped memory configuration you get really heavy and consistent stuttering whereas you can see here it's actually running reasonably you know this is a usable battlefield 5 gaming experience yeah it's running fine at 1080p low settings there is some quite wild frame rate fluctuation it occasionally goes down below 30 frames per second which is not ideal now when it comes to gpu power draw we're maxing out at 60 watts which means this isn't the most powerful configuration of an rtx 3050 ti at 80 watts but it's not a particularly weak one either now just a quick note on the temperatures they are quite a bit higher playing cyberpunk but it's because i was running an hour worth of cinebench runs while downloading the patch for a cyberpunk and it took the laptop really long for it to hit this temperature level actually on the note of the cinebench scores this 12 700h is a real monster just look at those scores and the laptop didn't get that noisy while running an extended heavy load anyway with that let's upgrade the ram configuration and see what that does cool ah yes we're really stretching the legs on this 60 watt 30 50 ti now look at that good old almost 100 utilization while it's clearly important to upgrade the ram on this laptop i was still impressed with how well this 12th gen laptop cpu handled the loser ram configuration so it turns out this laptop does not encapsulate the soul of genghis khan and it's an example of just the kind of crazy laptop deals you can find if you look around at the moment i think it's a good compromise you get lots of gaming power that isn't particularly hot or noisy and the compromise is turtle death a mediocre keyboard a battery that doesn't give you more than 30 minutes of gaming on the go and a display which is very usable for gaming but it doesn't measure particularly well and it struggles with off-axis viewing but at this price even if it set fire to my eyebrows every time i used it i wouldn't really mind anyway with that thank you for watching if you enjoyed the video consider watching another one and until the next video bye you",

    "transcript": "What's up guys lew here back with another video and today it is an epic ....product an epic unboxing it might be, I don't really know but ah.. this is a levitating speaker and i have seen these things heard about them never actually had one in front of me that i'm going to test for you a bluetooth speaker that sorta floats there in space it floats over top of this base there is air space between it like there is no connection point i believe it uses magnet and as much as it is about sound it also about just this really cool thing to look at a levitating speaker called the AIR 2 it uses Bluetooth 4.0 as you can see over here it's also got a microphone built-in for hands free functionality you can actually answer phone calls on it is portable you can take the speaker portion off of the levitation stand and take it wherever you want to go without having to move the entire base wide audio spectrum rechargeable battery 3.5 millimeter audio connector if you don't want to use the Bluetooth and the portable speaker mounts to magnetic surfaces that's cool you could stick it to the fridge I guess make a lot of sense to you Jack yeah, okay why are we looking at the box let's get inside and levitate some stuff that's what you're here for here is the speaker got some weight to it I will say that much some buttons: power, phone call pickup and volume up and down and then on the back a micro USB port for charging and the 3.5 millimeter jack but this is the fun part the levitation base. Wow, check out that mirrored finish look at his, look at yourself guys there's a USB port here I assume that's going to charged up the speaker itself and then a power outlet okay like in there wow major wow holy powerful magnet did I just crack it? we need to get this baby powered on. What it is? here's the USB to charge this I hope this has power plugged in hold the power button of course. AIR 2! it's all happening so this is to get it setup levitating damn that's really cool I mean it's totally unnecessary obviously but when you see it here like this I don't know something to it I don't know man. That's something so cool i know it's just magnets ok let's play some music real quick ok it's probably not cool to do that let's try something else I mean, I kind of like just watching it ok listen, it is not the best bluetooth speaker I've ever heard but I mean this is fun, there's something fun about it You're just on the couch and the little levitation besides you like your on some next level Your're on something they don't even know about Teaching your friends about magnets All right, I'm charging it up right now but in the meantime like you can still play it, right it still completely works while it's charging it's not levitating it's not gonna levitate with the cord attached but this is standalone the base is just sort of like a dock for the actual speaker meaning it's like a home for it I don't know if you're looking for something cool that not everybody else has this might be worth looking at my top choice for Bluetooth speaker by any means but it does a cool trick and I could just see myself using it because of that it's two things it's not just the sound is like the ambience, the environment that it creates when it's sitting here floating and it's a little bit of a conversation starter you know from here on out levitate or die that's extreme anyway ok so let's unplug it and let's just let's roll out a little bit of music and a little bit of levitation it has it's own ringtone are we rolling?",

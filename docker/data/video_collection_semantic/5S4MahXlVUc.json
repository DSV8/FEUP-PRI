    "transcript": "I have to be honest with you guys I was very skeptical of Cooler Master delivering on their promises with the mm710 we even trolled them at Computex by bringing a scale to their booth and measuring the weight but since its arrival to my mouse mat I'm happy to report it has not left all right so I have three pieces of good news for you number one the mm 710 is available to purchase today for $50 so this is no longer on the pre-order and that leave links below number two it is an awesome alternative to the glorious Model O that some people might find too small as the mm710 is wider and it's definitely more accessible and affordable than the overhyped final Mouse ultralight tube and for number three today's video sponsor privacy comm keeps your mind at ease from credit and debit card theft with the use of their virtual cards so you never share your personal info when making purchases online more on that later so if you're looking into the mm 710 you're probably interested in that super light form factor and this thing is only 53 grams and I think it would definitely give you an advantage for FPS games and you probably want something small too as this is one of the smallest mice in my collection now I am coming from the model oh and that thing feels like an elephant now but a more appropriate size comparison is the G Pro from Logitech that is about the same length and width at its widest point as the mm710 it is a very comfortable shape for my hand size with not too aggressive top curve so it doesn't feel too flat and for my hybrid grip everything just feels well in place and despite the ambidextrous shell the thumb buttons are only for the right hand it does come in four colors but those are not available just yet and to keep the weight as low as possible there is no illumination now in comparison to the model o that is the same price at 50 bucks and just like the heavier you do get that awesome side and interior light spill but to be honest I'm really into this whole matte black set for my desk top and because of the exposed nature of the shell internal components are coated for protection against dust and moisture I do want to address some build quality concerns from the early units so the primary buttons right now still exhibit a little bit of wobble but not as severe as before it looks like the side shell has been reinforced because pressing into them no longer activates the side switches but unfortunately that internal rattle that everyone else also has experienced is still present on my retail unit I have no complaints on button placement or feel the scrollwheel is excellent with defined steps and light middle-click the DPI shift is tucked away from accidental presses the thumb buttons have satisfying tactility and softness when pressed and primary switches have that fast travel to feel really similar to my model oh so excellent all around the feet are white PTFE with super smooth glide this is smoother than my model oh the Razer viper or the g pro while the cable is their ultra weave cable for Wireless like feel it is awesome and finally the sensor is a Pixar 3389 so you have seven dpi levels at one hundred dpi increments with two lift off distance adjustments and surface calibration in the software and I've had nothing but pleasure using this and games and initially yes it was a bit too light as I'm coming from a much larger model O at 67 grams but the 53g body kind of became part of my hand for easy across her navigation and just told really natural to use to stay on target and apply whatever aim directional shooting speed and the only reason why this might not be a good fit for you is if you find it too light and you prefer something heavier to give you a little bit extra stability when you aim and if also the shape is somehow not for you it's either too large or doesn't accommodate your grip well and I'm actually quite surprised at how similar this thing feels to my G Pro from Logitech and just how uncomfortable the model of - feels in comparison to the mm710 now the good thing is the mm710 is available to purchase today and it's relatively inexpensive at only 50 dollars while today's sponsor privacy comm is actually a free service that creates virtual credit cards for online merchants like Amazon Netflix iTunes and others so your real credit and debit cards stay protected in case of breaches from those online merchants setting up a card is no hassle at all with a handy spend limit customization for each card so you don't worry about cancelling a subscription or changing your card in case one of them gets hacked plus you get notified if the card is used elsewhere the service is free it's encrypted and comes with a handy Chrome extension so visit privacy.com/hwc to get your $5 credit on your first privates purchase that is privacy.com/hwc thanks so much for watching subscribe to be notified when the epic battle between the mm710 and the glorious model o comes out make sure to check out this other visual goodness thanks so much for watching I'll talk to you guys in the next video",

    "transcript": "- Sure we could sit and think about how messed up the world is and how every waking moment of human existence involves some pain, or, and hear me out here, we could just do some tech news. - [James] Yeah. - What do you say, James? - [James] Can there be a campfire? - No, it's dangerous. This is paper. Intel unveiled its second-generation neuromorphic chip yesterday, the Loihi2, which is about 10 times faster than its predecessor. Neuromorphic. James, do you know what that means? - [James] I can guess. - Brains. - [James] Change. - In the chip. - [James] Okay. - Of course, Intel, isn't the only one making processors inspired by human brains. These days they're found in all sorts of devices, including flagship smartphones. But Intel's new chip is special because it's one of the first to use the company's Intel 4 process with extreme ultraviolet, or UV, lithography. Something that almost every other chip manufacturer has been using for some time. But now Intel is doing it. And like you still clap for the last kid across the finish line on track and field day. - [James] Hey, you did great. - (stutter) You made it and that's what counts. Now the Loihi2 isn't going to go in your gaming PC. It's designed for researchers. And to make their job a bit easier, Intel has also released an open-source software framework called Lava. So hopefully those science-y people can make our electronics a bit smarter without burning themselves. (laughs) - [James] It's all very Hawaiian sounding. - Yeah, well it is. It's a volcano, which is why the lava. - [James] Thank you. - I could have worked that in. PC enthusiasts have been chomping at the bit to catch a glimpse of the rumored graphics card collaboration between ASUS and Noctua and now images of the fabled card have appeared online. They were spotted in a Facebook post by the Vietnamese branch of ASUS. And yep. It's a, it's an RTX 3070 with brown fans. Excited. You guys like this? - [James] I love it. - It's brown. - [James] It won't look good next to anything. - It's tan. I will say it is a thick boy. It looks like it'll take up a full four PCIe expansion slots. But if Noctua's CPU coolers or anything to go by, we could expect this thing to be hiding some big old heat pipes under that cooler and fans that run as quietly as physically possible. Because GPU should be seen, not heard. - [James] Like back in your cage. - Like my parents told me. I didn't see any Strix branding on there, but if they don't end up using that, it's a bit of a shame. That's one of the ASUS's gaming brands. Got an owl mascot. You seen it? - [James] No. - Noctua uses an owl too. They love owls. So who knows when this thing is coming out and more importantly, who cares? Because it'll be way too expensive and you won't be able to get it. - [James] Keep watching out videos though. (both laugh) - And Facebook is still dealing with the fallout of a slew of Wall Street Journal reports covering the company's research into the effects of Instagram on teens. Facebook's Head of Safety, Antigone Davis. That's a name, huh? - [James] Nice. - It's fun. But she was grilled by members of Congress yesterday and was asked by Senator Blumenthal if Facebook would commit to ending finsta. - [Blumenthal] Will you commit to ending finsta? - Leading to many \"Okay Boomer\" reactions before the Senator clearly explained that he knew what finsta was. It's short for \"fake Instagram\" and is a term for kids' secret secondary accounts. Facebook may not be able to do anything about finstas without adopting the kind of ID verification seen in China, and I don't think we want that. But what they can do, and what they did, is publish heavily annotated slides from the studies the WSJ reported on in an attempt to show everyone what they really say. You didn't see the real ones. These are the, these are the ones that are most important. Sure. Use of their platforms is correlated with lower well-being, but that's not causation. That's basic science. We should listen to Facebook here, the bastion of rationality and logic. - [James] We need more connectedness. - That's how you do it. - [James] We need each other. - Yeah, cooperation guys.

The USB Implementers Forum continues to not understand how to name things good. They just released the spec for USB Power Delivery 3.1, which will enable Type C cables that support charging at up to 240 Watts. To make this nice and simple, they released a table with seven different logos and labels. So customers can simply look at a cable's packaging and easily understand what it's capable of after only a few minutes of Googling. Pre-orders for the modular and easily repairable Fairphone 4, much anticipated by tech enthusiasts, have finally launched with a base model going for 579 euros or $671. And it's too bad that US price doesn't actually matter at all because this Fairphone is only launching in Europe and the UK. I can only imagine it's because of the launch of a phone that might reduce waste and protect the environment would be met with heavy protests all across the greatest country in the world. - [James] It's not American. - Hey, don't be mad (stutters) Look, I don't make fun of America that much on this show. Give me this one. Corsair has launched their first gaming monitor, the Xeneon 32QHD165. Because you want to grab potential customers with a real catchy name. It's a 32-inch 2560 by 1440p IPS monitor with a 165 Hertz refresh rate. We haven't had nearly enough monitors that make this kind of compromise between resolution and speed. So I definitely would be more excited if it didn't remind me of Intel's Workstation processors. Xeneon? - [James] It's stupid. - Come on. - [James] Of all the names. - There's so many names, like we could list them. Nreal launched their latest smart glasses that actually look like something a normal person would want to buy for once. The Nreal Air does not have any cameras, unlike Facebook's recent collab with RayBan, but it does have little 90 Hertz screens in the lenses that can apparently project a virtual 130-inch screen. I bet watching movies on this thing is something someone want, on earth wants to do. They probably exist somewhere. And in an attempt to avoid paying the EU's $5 billion antitrust fine, Google argued that the most searched term on one of their biggest search competitors, Bing, was actually \"Google\". Proving that if they do have a monopoly, it's through no fault of their own. That information comes from SEO company, Ahrefs. And I mean, it does make sense. I'm not, if I'm going on Bing, that's what I'm doing. (both speaking) - [James] You're the best. (laughs) - I feel like Microsoft keeps forcing Bing into everything like a, like a pushy parent. like maybe Bing doesn't want to grow up to be a search engine. I don't know Microsoft. Maybe ask Bing how Bing's feels for once. (explosion booms) I don't know. This episode feels like it's over. So come back on Monday for more tech news. It will distract from the pain for a little while. (fake crying)",

    "transcript": "(upbeat music) - Hello and welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of advanced ray tracing. The technology that everyone clamors for every day. Kids going to school, screaming for advanced ray tracing. Taylor Swift, get outta here, it's advanced ray tracing they're looking for. - She also wants it. - She does. - Yeah. - Loudly and proudly at the VMAs. - Yep. - Demanding. - That's all she talks about. - Hi, I'm your friend, Nilay. Alex Cranz is here in the studio. We're together. - Yes, this is so exciting. And we're not CGI, even though the ray tracing looks like we are. - Yeah, look at those reflections. - Oh my God, they're incredible, aren't they? - No one can stop them. David Pierce is here. - You know how Tom Cruise has made his thing that he's the enemy of motion smoothing? Taylor Swift should do this for ray tracing. Taylor, if you're listening, and I know that you are, please make a thing where you come on at the beginning of every video game and you tell me how important it is to turn on ray tracing. This is your moment to do real good in the United States of America. - Be like, \"Pick visual fidelity over performance.\" - Post about that with your cat, Taylor. - I will say... Wow. I will say that in the comments of our YouTube, there's a raging mini conspiracy theory about whether David is actually in a living room or in front of a green screen, and we're never gonna tell. - Never. - We're never gonna tell. We're also never gonna tell you how long the show's supposed to be. We're just gonna keep saying \"We're going over\" and David is gonna keep clipping a little bit, but not all the way. - I don't think I've ever seen David sit on that couch. - Yeah. No one's ever been back there. - Yeah. - What couch? Wait, what? - But once we get ray tracing enabled on David, you'll never be able to tell if he's green screened or not. - Oh my God, it's gonna look so sick back there. - Full volumetric, static image of a living room. We're gonna send millions of dollars to-- - Just so many like, \"Oh my God, the sun hits it, \"the reflections...\" - If you're looking for more mediocre Star Wars shows, just wait until we enable David's volumetric set. - Oh, there we go. Now... Okay. Liam, this just changed everything. Now, instead of having my one maybe real, maybe static background, I get to have a new one every single podcast. - Yeah. - We're doing this. I do, I will say... I have a, I think, eight foot wide green screen underneath this couch over here. - You've given it away. Well, I guess it's a second eight foot wide green screen. - Right, it's the green screen behind the green screen. But the setup to make it work with my computer was so complicated that we just gave up, which is why I don't have a more interesting background, unfortunately. - Yeah. Well, soon, we'll get you the full volume and Jon Favreau is gonna direct you in a Meta Quest. - Deal, I'll wear the helmet. - That's how he directed The Lion King. - I'm into it. - I think it might have been a Rift actually. - (indistinct) he wore a headset? - Yeah, 'cause when they made The Lion King-- - That's right! - It's like all... It's all CGI, so he directed it in a headset. I don't know exactly why he was in the headset, but there's a lot of photos of him in a headset, directing The Lion King. - Just sitting there. - It's good. Okay, there is actually news to talk about, including a legitimate ray tracing segue to what is arguably the news of the week, which is the PS5 Pro. - Not the iPhone? - The iPhone... I guess the iPhone happened this week. - This is a lot-- - If I'm being completely honest, based on just the vibes on theverge.com, the PS5 Pro might be bigger news than the iPhone, which I think says something about the iPhone this year, but also says a lot about how a lot of people feel about the particulars of the PS5 Pro. - I just legitimately forgot that it was the iPhone (indistinct) this week. In my mind, we did a Vergecast, the week ended, I took a flight home, it was a red eye. I was asleep, I woke up in New York. That's a new week everybody, start the calendar right over. But I think you're generally correct, David. In the room, it's very hard for me to tell 'cause it's just an artificially hype environment. But out here in the world... Even other reporters I've talked to, interest is low. - Yeah, it's not great. - Not only that, but it was so disappointing that I think the general Apple vibes are bad because of it. A lot of people all over the internet, and some of them at this website that we work at called theverge.com, who are generally people who like Apple and think stuff that Apple does is cool, are like turning on the company. To the point where it's like, \"Is this an inflection point \"where Apple has lost the plot?\" That's a thing you see over, and over, and over now. It's wild. - Yeah. I would say I saw John Gruber, who... I saw at the event. He... John lives a charmed lifestyle. He came to the event armed only with a pen and a notebook. - I love that. - Incredible. - Incredible. - I mean, I think he had a phone on him, but he had no laptop. But he tweeted afterwards, \"Apple misses Steve Jobs like everyone else,\" or some variation of that sentence, which is a lot. That's a big one. MG Siegler, who is also a friend, wrote an entire blog post about how Apple one needs an editor. It has too many products and it can't say no. And part of his thesis was they're too stuck to the way Steve Jobs would've done things, and they need to change for... They need to make more aggressive changes. His example, of course, being the iPad, just let it run Mac OS, which is a hard diversion. It's extreme nerdery. But you see that vibe is out there, right? This is a company that's no longer saying no. It knows it's about to make more money from services than the hardware, so it's just making all the hardware without a point of view. I don't know, man, I think the thing that's weirdest for me is they're gonna ship the phones without the software. - [Alex] It's sloppy-feeling. - And there's just something about that, that they wouldn't have done that before. - Yeah. Well, they... It was only a couple of years ago where they did that whole thing where they said, \"We are gonna slow down \"on all of our software \"'cause we are going too fast \"and we're getting too sloppy.\" And then to see them just kind of do it again, but even more aggressively, is surprising. - Yeah. So we'll see. And there's... I think a big question that I have in general is whether any of the AI stuff comes to anything. We're gonna talk about some AI products later on the show. There's some interesting ones that have come out. Some stuff is happening that is legitimately interest-raising. Whether it's gonna make all of the money that the AI industry is currently spending, who knows? But Apple's in a rush to ship this stuff. For what? I don't know. But I agree with you, David. To my mind, the PS5 Pro is... It's generated more interest because it is a more considered product. It has a stronger point of view on what's gonna happen next. - Whether you agree with that point of view or not. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can disagree with it but it's a stronger statement of whatever might... Whatever Sony thinks is next. While Microsoft is making the opposite statement of like, \"Maybe we should shut this down.\" Right, and there's some turmoil happening in that industry, and there's like winners and losers, and it just seems... At least on the smartphone side. And we have covered smartphones since the day The Verge started. Like our... We began this thing in 2011 because of smartphones. And it feels like whatever wave that is has crested into a steady state, even though just over there are some of the most interesting smartphones that have ever existed. - Like the Tri-fold. - Yeah, like the Honor Tri-fold, got more co... It was at the top of CNBC. That's how I know things have broken out of gadget world, is when more mainstream outlets cover things in weird ways. - Yeah. - And so, we looked at the top of the CNBC website, on Apple Day or the day after, and it was the normal stuff. Like, \"Rate cut? \"No. \"Yes. \"Who know...\" Like, it's CNBC. And then just in the middle of that was \"$2,800 triple fold smartphone.\" And it was like, that's the keyword. Like, a bunch of finance bros were like, \"Hell yeah. \"I wanna spend $3,000 on \"an insane smartphone.\" - They wanna watch the charts go up and down. Big and wide, yeah. - On the biggest phone they can. And it's like, that is more interesting to people than whatever is happening. It wasn't \"Apple announces iPhone 16,\" right? And there's something there. It's a gimmick. Who knows, right? - [Alex] We'll see. - But there's just something... Something is up. - Yeah. - We're going to... We're going to carry on with the coverage. Ideally, we will review the phones. We'll have something to say about them. Like I said, I'm still open to audience feedback on how to cover phones that are launching without the core software that they're supposed to have. - Unfinished. - We've gotten a lot of that feedback by the way, and I think it's... It's interesting to me, and I would say the plurality of the folks who've reached out to us agree with me, that you in particular are so hung up on this software that hasn't launched. Because I would say there is very little indication that anything in that software is going to meaningfully change your life in any way. This is the AI story right now, is you have to tell people you have an AI strategy and what cool products are there that exist that are mattering to lots of people all the time. - The thing is you don't have to do that unless you're totally behold-- - Oh, you do. You get fired and your company goes out of business if you don't. - You have to... You are so beholden to the stock market, and you're so beholden to your shareholders, that you are not actually considering what is a good product. And that feels like what we're butting up against is people chasing the shareholders at the expense of the audience. - Oh, I agree, I think it's the whole thing. And actually, shipping is all downside. Like, when you put this stuff out in the world, that's when all the bad stuff happens. It's like... - That's when we know the rabbit sucks. - It's like the old Silicon Valley line, right? \"Don't start making money \"because then people start asking \"why you're not making more money.\" Don't start shipping AI because then everybody will ask why you're not shipping better AI. Google has been through this 10 times over at this point. It just keeps shipping stuff and it's broken, and people freak out, and it's bad, and it is just nuking its core business in the name of chasing AI stuff, and people are starting to wonder why. But if you don't tell investors that you have an AI strategy, you won't have a job long enough to see any of it through. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So it's like, if I'm Apple, I think... This is a total conspiracy theory that is not actually what's going on, but it is not a stupid idea to slow roll this as much as you can. \"Talk it up and don't ship it\" is a pretty solid save-your-ass strategy-- - But it's totally out of character for them. - It's totally out of character but AI has been out of character for everybody. So many companies have not been themselves since Chat-GPT launched. - That's true. I will say I've been playing with a Pixel 9 Pro these past few days and every time you pick up that phone, it's like, \"Do you want me to do something for you? \"Have you met Gemini? \"Here I am. \"Would you like to add yourself to this photo? \"You're not in this photo? \"Put yourself in the photo.\" - Yeah, and you're like, \"Can you just turn off Bluetooth?\" And it's like, \"Ah, I can't, so sorry.\" - It is like a... It is like a version of Clippy from hell. It's like, \"Do you want me to add some text \"to this email for some reason? \"I could.\" - Yeah. - \"Huh? \"Why not?\" - Why not? - It's fine. It's just a very... It's a weird time. That said, we'll pick up the Apple stuff later. One thing to note, I hear what you're saying, that it's weird that I'm focused on the softwares and shipping 'cause I'm Mr. Review-what's-in-the-box. One thing that did get announced just in the time between the event and today, the FDA actually did approve the hearing aid features for the AirPods 2. - That's very cool. - Which I continue to believe will be the biggest... The most impactful announcement of this event. - Yes. - So that did happen. We assume it will ship later this fall now because they have the clearance. That's a big deal. But that's it? I don't... we're waiting on everything else. All right, let's actually talk about PS5 Pro. What is it, Alex? - You know, have you ever like looked at a computer and you're like, \"What if this computer was a little cheaper?\" - Yeah. - \"It didn't do as much stuff, \"it played video games really, really well, \"but it was also twice as much \"as another thing we have \"that plays video games really, really well?\" - Yeah. - \"And it just plays it a little better?\" - Is this just like a GPU upgrade for the PS5? - It basically is, yeah. It's A GPU upgrade. It's got a much bigger GPU. They are claiming much better ray tracing. And also their version of DLSS, which is an Nvidia thing that like upscales, so much more intelligent AI-- - But it's not actually DLSS? - It's not actually DLSS 'cause that's Nvidia-- - It's just their AMD based riff on? - Right. - Okay. - They're AMD-based, but not actually the AMD version. This is a Sony version... - Oh, good. - Of the same thing, AI upscaling. And those are kind of the three big deals out of it. And the other big part of it is that the price, it's $700. The normal one's about 450. And so, it's not quite twice, but it's expensive. - Yeah. - And it's also got no disc drive and people are having a lot of feelings about the disc drive. - Well, you can get an accessory one, right? - You can get an accessory one but it's kind of like, remember when they took the disc drive out of the MacBook and everybody lost their mind? It's the same thing. It's like physical media. I love physical media. It feels like physical media has been on an uptick. And now, it's like, \"Oh, so I've just spent $700 for this \"and then another $80 for the disk drive.\" - What this feels like to me is as if Apple revved the Mac Pro and was like, \"This thing is sick! \"Fastest ever! \"Everything is amazing. \"You're gonna love it. \"It has one USB-C port. \"That's it, enjoy.\" It doesn't make any sense to me that you would make your highest end, most impressive-looking thing, which has a Venn diagram of users that I would say overlaps fairly aggressively with the section of users who care about things like physical media and having a collection of discs and cares about the liner notes and all that stuff, those two people are the same person. And so, the idea that you're gonna be like, \"We're gonna give you \"all the power in the world \"but no physical media\" is just so strange to me. Even if it were gonna make this thing more expensive, if it was $800 and had a disc drive, I would understand it way more than I understand $700 and no disc drive. - But you can spend $780 and get the disc drive. - You can. - Yeah. But I think it's the fact that it's called the \"Pro,\" it is so much more expensive, and then it doesn't have a disc drive. So that's where people are getting concerned. But at the same time, as we talked about earlier, this is where they're heading, right? They've been heading this way for a long time. They don't want you to have a disc drive. They don't want you using the discs. They want you-- - They certainly do not want used games to exist. - Yeah, they want you buying the thing on their store, and then when it doesn't work, going and buying the new upgrade on their store over, and over, and over again. They're very happy with that. And most of the developers and stuff seem pretty fine with that. It's just the real hardcore fans. But the hardcore fans so far are really excited about this thing. - Wait, I'm... I like a disc drive, I like physical media, I like owning software. I think my prerequisites on this are... My cred is there, I wanna-- - You've talked about it a bit, yeah. - You know, I feel... So let me just make the argument here... - Yeah. - The PS5 in particular from inception has been all about wicked fast SSD speeds. - Yes. - So you were never playing the game off the optical disc. You were always copying it to the SSD. So the disc is like a totem. - Yes. - Right, you're always downloading the game. - You're holding it and you're like, \"Yeah, I can do this.\" Theoretically, you can play parts of the game off of the disc, but for the most part it's downloading it on, versus-- - Well, you're definitely at least copying enormous chunks of the game from disc to SSD. - Yeah, and then you have to do your day zero updates and all of that stuff. - So what... I'm just like, if you... Like, I am a person with a vinyl collection. - Yeah. - And it's like, I like to put on a record and then shake my fist at the man because they can't... The internet has nothing to do with listening to music in that case. - I think the concern here is that now you can't... If you wanna play a PS4 game or something, if you wanna play an older game-- - Sure. - You can't use... You have to pay extra for that. If you wanna watch a movie, which, like, the PS5 has historically been a very good Blu-ray player, you have to now pay extra for that. And it's got that \"Pro\" moniker, so you're like, \"Okay.\" - I see what you're saying. It is just like value for dollar. - Yeah, it's just like... It's a squirrely, squirrely space. But like the PS5 Pro is really cool. But I'm like a graphics nerd, so I'm like, \"Yeah, this is sick!\" But also, I don't need to spend $700 on this thing. I've got a PS5 with a disc drive. It rules. I play games on it. - The thing that actually gets me is right next to this, they released Astro Bot, which is like Game of the Year contender. - Yes. - I've been playing Astro's Playroom with Max, we were like gonna... We bought the controller, which is adorable. We're gonna play Astro Bot whenever she tires of Astro's Playroom. The thing about a six year old is like, \"Yeah, just keep playing this game.\" - Yeah, just the first five minutes over and over and over again. - Yeah, you're good, actually. We don't need to introduce new ideas or spend money. But like, from what I can tell, Astro Bot is the reason to buy a PS5 and it is not the reason to buy a PS5 Pro. It just feels... Those things feel disconnected to me in a way that seems ridiculous. - Yeah, 'cause the Astro Bot is focusing in kind of like the Nintendo play style of... Nintendo is all about... It doesn't care about the graphics as much, it cares about how the game plays. Whereas PlayStation and Xbox have historically been like, \"We care about how the game plays \"but also we want it to look fucking sick.\" - Yeah. - And in this case, they're like, \"Nah... \"We've got this one side \"where we had this Astro Bot, \"and you can use the controller in all \"these really incredible ways. \"Feels like a Switch. \"It feels just new, and dynamic, and fun. \"And then we got this like...\" - Other thing. - Yeah, \"This thing \"so you can go play Gran Turismo \"and it looks really cool.\" - What's the best argument for the PS5 Pro? - Do you really like Spider-Man 2? - And that's always... That's like the core argument for the PlayStation-- - Yeah, really. - The PlayStation 3 has literally had the Spider-Man font on it. So... - It really is like... The core argument is, \"Do you really like \"The Last of Us,\" \"and \"Spider-Man,\" and some of these other games \"that have actually implemented ray tracing? \"And do you really want to... \"Like, do you really, really like that? \"And if so, go get this \"because it's gonna look a little sharper, \"it's gonna look a little cleaner.\" I think if you are playing on a con... If you're playing your console on a monitor, it makes sense. - Sure. If you're playing it on a big TV in a huge, sunlit room, don't do this. That's just a waste of money. You will not be able to appreciate a single bit of this. - I will say, I think the most compelling argument of this, and I think... Is his name Mark Cerny, the lead architect? Okay, I can never remember if it's Matt or Mark. It's like the same-- - It's Mark. - It's two different people in my head. But anyway, it's Mark. Said basically, that the thing that they've seen is that everybody is forever making trade-offs between performance and fidelity, right? So do I want it to look good or do I want lots of frames? And that is like kind of the gaming performance trade off. And with the PS5 Pro, you don't have to make that trade off, right? You can have very high settings at very high frame rates. That's not a thing that most people will notice, but it is the kind of thing that matters, right? Like, it's... I see that as the same argument for why the two of you spent six times as much money on your televisions as I did. It's not for everybody-- - Because my eyes work, David. - Yeah, then why not spend $700 on this? - And I happily set it to fidelity mode and I let it drop frames while I try to figure out the new kicking indicator format in every year. It's fine. It's impossible to use. - But I think to your Astro Bot point, I think the thing that is odd to me about this launch is that there isn't one sort of great example, right? There's a bunch of games. They've actually, I think, upgraded a lot of games. There are a lot of things that will look slightly better. But this is the sort of thing that I think works when you can come out with a next generation-looking game. - Oh, well, I think that's increasingly hard to do. We've seen this since-- - Oh, for sure. - Since like the PS3, of saying, \"Oh, I think we're kind \"of hitting our limit on \"how we can make... \"How good we can make these games look.\" And the difference between a PS4 and a PS5 game, I'm so sorry to a lot of people out there who are gonna be really upset with me right now, isn't actually that different. Yeah, I will notice it. Nilay will notice it. A small group of fans are really gonna notice those differences. The majority of people are just gonna be like, \"Yeah, that's the game.\" \"Sometimes it's a little blurry, \"sometimes it's not.\" And the majority of people don't care about that. And they're really trying to push this idea... They said, \"Oh, a lot more people are choosing \"the performance mode over the fidelity mode. \"We wanted to give them the op... \"Make them not have to choose, \"that's why we did this.\" How many people? I don't think it's the majority of people, - But that's fine, right? This isn't supposed to be for everybody. - Yeah. - It's for professionals. - Yeah, but it's for profession... Who is the professional? Who is the-- - This is just for Ninja. That's the only... - But it's not like there's any Pro features here. The Pro feature is \"We put a bigger GPU in \"because we could fit a bigger GPU in.\" And one of the criticisms of the original PS5 was that it was... It and the Xbox were underpowered as soon as they arrived because they were based on that current gen AMD technology. And so, it's like, they've always been a little behind the times, but the exchange is that the games just play. And so now, that PlayStation is putting all these options in and making you think about these things, you're starting to think of it less like a console, where just you plug it in and go, and you're starting to think of it more like a PC. And I think that's a dangerous place for Sony to be. Historically, the famous PC pro... Successful PC program over there. They really know how to do it. But like, it works for Microsoft. It makes sense for Microsoft. Microsoft's doing the exact same thing. Both of these companies are pushing these things towards PCs. They fundamentally are. All the technology in them is PC technology. They're based on AMD's technology. Nintendo's over on the other side saying, \"What if we just did cool shit?\" - \"What if we made good games?\" - Yeah, \"What if we just make good games?\" And it's a weird place that Sony's taking this, and I don't know if So... It makes sense for Xbox, it doesn't make as much sense for Sony. - I will point out that the $80 disc drive is sold out on Amazon, and Best Buy, and Target. So-- - This is the Venn diagram. Like, truthfully, I think-- - Well, it also works for the PS5 Slim. So there's a lot of Slim owners out there, I'm sure. - This is what kills me. The Slim not having a disc drive, I completely understand. - Yes. - That makes perfect sense. Having it be cheaper and smaller, and for people whose games are digital, which is most people, makes absolute perfect sense to me. This just doesn't. And in this one tiny lane, you have a group of people who will put up with a bigger console, who are likely to pay more for it, who are willing to make all the sacrifices required to get the very best possible everything out of it, right? The only reason to buy this is if you want the 10 out of 10 experience. - Yeah. - [Liam] Let me get in here with my hot take. - Okay, let's go Liam. - [Liam] Y'all ready? - We're ready. - [Liam] The problem with the PS5 Pro is not that it's too expensive, it's that it's not expensive enough. They should have released a 999 version of this thing, not a $700. It should actually be a PC that you can hook up to your TV and have the lovely experience of just it always working for your game. You just turn it on and start playing your game, but with the graphics that people are buying their PC games for. Sony knows that there are a lot of people out there that care about having the best possible version of their games and they'll play them on PC. I think they've proven that they could sell a 999 PS5 to the extreme end of the market, the enthusiasts. - I like that you've just pitched a home theater PC. Everything comes all the way around. - I was just about to say, somebody at Microsoft is hearing this, going, \"Oh God, oh God, oh God.\" - \"We're gonna do it again.\" - [Liam] They were just too soon. They were just too soon. - They're too soon. - No, I... To Liam's point, I do think the idea of \"Play PC games but don't have \"to deal with Windows\" would be compelling to a surprisingly large number of people, which I think is also what Microsoft thinks and can't figure out what to do with. - It's trying, it's trying. I mean, I think the next Xbox... Not the next... Next new gen Xbox. - Did you just describe the Steam Deck? - Yeah. - Right, I mean, isn't that the... Like, you're on a plane, you can play PC games, and doesn't run Windows so the battery life is good? - Yeah, but the Steam Deck runs a... Runs a smartphone chip on a tiny screen. - Yeah. It's like a potato compared to the PS5 graphics-wise. - All right. Here's my poll for the Vergecast audience. Let's assume you own a PS5. What would you rather spend money on, a Steam Deck or a PS5 Pro? You let us know. I'm very... I feel like, just based on this conversation, that's more of a choice than we are... Right? - No, I think that's the wrong question. I don't think... This is like every year when people are like, \"Should you upgrade from \"the iPhone 15 to the 16?\" The answer is no and no one is doing that. The answer is if you have a PS4 or a PS4 Pro. Like, to me the interesting upgrade path is if you have a PS4 Pro and you've been sitting around, waiting for the PS5 Pro to buy one, is this the thing you were waiting for? If you have a PS5, I would bet the number of people who are like, \"Oh, throw my PS5 in the trash. \"I'm buying a PS5 Pro to get \"slightly better ray tracing\" is like vanishingly small. But I don't think that's who Sony is going for here. - But I also think the PS4 Pro people... I was one of those people. I had a PS4 pro. I really liked it. - I have one right here. - Yeah, it's great. Got a PS5 because it was new and I wanted to play all the new games. If you're on a PS4 Pro, you're now having to pay twice the amount. The PS5... The PS4 pro wasn't this high a markup between it and the regular PS4. - Didn't it also come out right after the PS4? - No, it took a while. - It was a couple years. - Yeah, it was a couple years. - Was it was a couple years? - And it was a big upgrade, 'cause you were doing 4K. You were doing a lot of big stuff in it. Whereas this one is just like, \"We've... \"Do you know what DLSS is?\" - \"We made our own weird version of it.\" - Yeah, and like that's a lot harder to sell to the normal folks. I say, because we're all big nerds here. We love having a good time. - Look, I watch these comparison videos. I waited for Digital Foundry to do its thing. - Yeah. - And I was still like, \"Yeah, I don't... \"I'm good. \"I'm horrible at Madden \"and I play Astro Bot.\" - The whole meme right now is people watching it and pausing it, and taking their glasses off and on, trying to see where the differences are between the two versions, 'cause it's really small. And yeah, it's noticeable, but it's really small. And most people don't care that much. They just wanna play the game. - I will issue my almost weekly reminder that you can't evaluate the quality of anything on your smartphone screen. - Yeah. - You just can't. You can't look at stuff on a smartphone screen. Just like when people try to... We do it all the time, when we're like, \"Listen to these speakers\" and we record them, and then people watch them on YouTube on their smartphone speakers, I don't know what's happening there. - That's nothing, yeah. - That's just a handshake agreement through the internet that we're gonna feel some vibes. - Yeah. - That's not right. - Just believe us, we're telling the truth. - That's how I feel about those (indistinct) videos. I don't know, I am very interested in what is happening in the broader gaming market 'cause it feels like that shakeup... - The split is like really happening, right? We knew this PC moment was happening for consoles but this in particular... It was a moment with PS4 Pro 'cause you were like, \"\"Okay, now we are fracturing \"the console market \"in a way the console market \"typically isn't fractured.\" The whole point of the console market is no fracture. Everything is you go, you buy this thing, it does the games, and now you're getting all these different SKUs. Sort of like Apple, just introducing all these different SKUs and like, \"Yeah, okay, you're gonna meet \"more of the market here, \"but you also lose why people like \"this product to begin with, \"which is simplicity.\" - I wonder if what we're seeing is just this incredible bifurcation of the gaming industry, where on the one hand you have the handheld revolution, right? Which is like... I think, is going to eat the low end consoles alive. It's already happening, right? Like, if I just want to play Astro Bot, the idea of me needing a gigantic box to do it, I think, is like... That's ending very quickly. Then, the flip side is the high end stuff is going to get higher end. So it feels like we're gonna end up in a place of like music streaming and vinyl, and nothing in between, right? You're either gonna have this beautiful, bespoke setup with a lot of very specific things, but it is going to be extremely high fidelity and wonderful, or we're going to lean deep into convenience, and streaming, and everything is gonna be lower quality, but that's what people want. - Well, I think there's a third prong here that kind of affects it, which is that they own so many of these studios that are making these games, and these studios aren't making games for anybody else, right? Like, Astro Bot, you can't go play that on anything but a Sony device 'cause Sony wants to keep you in their wheelhouse. And that's... Ooh, the FTC is gonna have feelings. If you get... I think if you get... If you're like, \"Look, we're basically PCs, \"we're doing all of this stuff. \"Also, you can't play Last of Us \"on anything else,\" people will start having feelings about that in a very real, real way that I'm kind of curious about. - Well, I think Sony's allowed to have its first party studios, which it has been whittling down. It's when Microsoft bought Activision and said \"We're gonna close off Call of Duty\" that you've got all the regulators. I would point out that ever since Microsoft actually closed that Activision deal, it has just been clown car city over there. Just banging into walls and falling off cliffs. - [Alex] It's great. - They announced just today that they're gonna lay off 650 more Xbox employees. - [Alex] That sucks. - This is just a wave of layoffs and strategy shifts, all after they fought tooth and nail to buy Activision because something... - Yeah, because they wanna have... Everybody wants their little fiefdom, and you have to go and buy the console to get in to play the games, rather than just play them on a PC, which they can all theoretically do because architecturally they're all the same. - Well, sure, but I'm... Sony at least has a... Well, first of all, it's the winner of this generation. - Yeah, 'cause it's got the good games. - If you don't count the Switch. It's legit-- - Which has won every generation that it's been anywhere near, right? And the new Switch, we think, is coming out that will probably win whatever generation it's a part of. - Yeah. - The cycles don't quite line up. But Sony has beaten Microsoft pretty soundly this generation. I hear what you're saying, like the underlying software, or the underlying hardware architectures, are similar. They're AMD chips. But the PS5 is... It's an opinionated device. - Yeah. - Right? Sony has a lot of thoughts about the PlayStation and what it's for, and what the game should work like. And Mark Cerny has a lot of ideas about settings, right? There's a vision there, for better or worse, and you can not feel it and you can be mad about the disc drive, but Sony has confidence. Microsoft has confidence. I think Phil Spencer is a confident person. They have a lot of ideas. But actually, they're... It feels to me like they knew they were losing, they wanted to make a big swing, and they have just whiffed on a bunch of their big swings. They whiffed on cloud gaming, which was supposed to be the biggest swing of all. They haven't pulled it off yet. - [Alex] Yeah. - This Activision deal, they let Call of Duty be the side show, but it was really about Candy Crush. And Phil has said this to us. \"Mobile gaming is the future \"and no one has a foothold there, \"we gotta win there.\" That was also kind of a weird side show of cloud gaming, it... And none of that... I don't think anybody, any consumer... If you're a gamer, please use the feature in iOS where it makes your emails a little bit nicer, but then email us. I'm curious, did Microsoft buying Activision improve anything about playing games for you? I don't see it yet. And it's true, the deal is pretty new. But you see that what's happening over there is they are looking for a new strategy or a new vision, and I think you needed that before you made one of the biggest acquisitions of all time. - But I think Sony's muddied... You talk about it's got this big, clear vision. It's muddied that vision. Because on the one point, hey yeah, you have Astro Bot, you have \"The Last of Us,\" you have Spider-Man. You have these games, these first-party games, that look gorgeous, are stunning, play great on this thing, have really kind of unique things focused on that controller. And then, you just have everything else. And Microsoft has kind of said, \"We're gonna be everything else. \"We're gonna own that space. \"We're gonna be the PCs, \"we're gonna bring gaming PCs \"into the console space.\" And Sony's now saying the same thing. Even though they've got this lead, they're saying, \"Yeah, we're gonna do the same thing. \"We're gonna muddy the waters here.\" And I think that's where the PS5 Pro doesn't have that clear vision you see in their games and things-- - Oh, I think it has one very clear vision. It costs more money. - Costs so much money. - Like, if you're gonna buy-- - Yeah. - Right now, if you're gonna buy a console, is there any or... And you already have a Switch. - Yeah. - 'Cause that's what you should buy. If you're gonna buy a console, you're gonna buy a PS5. - Yeah. - Right? They're the winner. That's what most people have chosen. - Unless you don't wanna play those first-party games. If you just wanna play Call of Duty and stuff, go get an Xbox. It'll just-- - No, most people are still gonna buy PlayStations. - Because all their friends are on it. - To extent that there is a default choice, it's the PlayStation. - Yeah. - Right. So then, you have a PlayStation and you can discount the regular one because you have your economy of scale. So you can go into the holiday and be like, \"Here's the cheap PlayStation,\" like you're saying. - Yeah, get that Series S. - I'm banking on that. - And then you can... There's some category of people that will just spend more money and you can sit there... We had a CFO at Vox Media, a long time ago, describe his job as waiting to catch the basketball. He's like, \"I'm just... \"The money comes and I'm here to get it.\" And I was like, \"I don't think that's what A CFO does\" but it was a learning experience for me. He was great. I think Sony is just like, \"Here's a more expensive one.\" - [Alex] Catch the money. - \"We're just here. \"If you've got some... \"If you have 300 extra dollars, \"we'll take it from you.\" - I do love that. Yeah, that's true. - This is the game both of these companies have been playing for like this whole generation, right? And Microsoft's bet has been, for years now, that we are on the cusp of a giant shift in how this entire industry works. How we play the games, where they are, how they're architected, the kinds of games that we play. Microsoft has been making this bet for a long time now. I think Microsoft still thinks it's right and is running out of patience for it to actually happen. Sony is just sitting around saying, \"Look at all this money flowing in.\" And then, the question will be, if you fast forward a few years, \"Is Microsoft going to be right \"before it gave up \"or is Sony just gonna have \"so much money at the end of it \"that who cares?\" But Sony is basically betting that this shift is going to happen slowly and Microsoft is betting that it's gonna happen fast. - Okay, I'm gonna end by saying one thing that will make everybody mad. - Yeah. - Or that you will completely agree with. I don't think there's a middle ground. It's weird that Microsoft has tried to run away from the idea of the Xbox being a thing that just plays games really well for so long. - It's never wanted that. - Right? It's like the whole Xbox One side quest where it had IR blasters and HDMI pass. Like what? I don't... People got so mad at me when I was like, \"This is a disaster.\" - My ongoing theory about this is that every once in a while, there's an executive meeting at Microsoft, and somebody turns to Phil Spencer and goes like, \"Why are you here?\" And so he has to explain why Xbox is part of Microsoft. And eventually that morphed into talking about Azure, and then it was just toast. - Right, can we run... This is what I mean. First, they're like, \"We're okay, we're gonna do it. \"We're gonna take over the... \"We're gonna have a Dish network integration \"in the Xbox.\" So they were all the way down the rabbit hole of that stuff and they walked it all back to games, and then it was reasonably successful again. And then, the... This generation, they were starting with games, and they're like, \"Well, we lost to Sony. \"We're gonna stream the games from Azure. \"That will disrupt the whole market.\" And that just has not panned out. - No. - And it just seems like if they-- - [Alex] Yeah, because they're-- - Maybe some focus on the main thing would continue to be successful. - But that's... Back it up to the first thing and it's a \"How do we be part of \"the Windows strategy?\" thing inside of Microsoft. And then, fast forward to this generation and it's a \"How do we be part \"of the cloud first strategy of Microsoft?\" I think there is a very compelling case to be made that the best and worst thing going for the Xbox team is that they work for Microsoft. - But you know, I was gonna say though, I think part of the reason they've been doing all this flip flopping is because their first-party games haven't landed the same. They just don't land. Sony's first-party games move consoles. People buy consoles for Sony's first party games. - I don't know, Halo was good for a while. - Halo. Name another one, - Halo 2. - You see? And Microsoft went on this whole buying spree. They were like, \"We're gonna buy all of these companies.\" And then they got told, \"(indistinct) \"You cannot make Call of Duty exclusive for you.\" - They own Minecraft. - Not exclusive. First-party exclusives. \"The Last of Us,\" \"Spider-Man,\" those are exclusive. They come to the PC eventually, and then you can play it through Xbox, I think, through the cloud, but you have to wait a while. If you wanna play \"The Last of Us,\" which all the other gamers are playing and everybody's talking about, you go get a Playstation. - Well, but I... Yeah, and I think that all... That all sort of flows from the same circles, right? Where it's like, \"Okay, \"if our job is to sell consoles, \"how do you sell consoles? \"You sell consoles with really good games. \"But if our job is to increase \"the market share of \"our cloud services arm of our company,\" you just prioritize things very differently. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - I think Phil Spencer would take deep issue with that characterization of Xbox, but it's always a little more true than anybody wants to be. By the way, can I just read you the first paragraph of his note announcing these layoffs? \"For the past...\" This is Phil Spencer, his memo to Microsoft employees. \"For the past year, our goal has been \"to minimize disruption while welcoming new teams \"and enabling to do their best work. \"As part of aligning \"our post-acquisition team structure \"and managing our business, \"we've made the decision to eliminate \"approximately 650 roles across...\" Welcome. You're fired. - That's tough. And then the end of it, he's like, \"We've had some good days \"and we've had some bad days, \"and this is a bad day.\" It's like, \"Thanks, Phil.\" - I mean, there's no good way to write those notes. - No, there's not. - I think mergers are bad. That's all I'm saying. I think, generally, they lead to chaos and disruption, and actually smaller companies with less focus or less ambition. And I suspect that will be, in the long run, true of the Activision deal. - Are you saying Warner Brothers-Discovery isn't a good company? - We gotta go. - We gotta take a break. - All right, yeah, we're taking a break. We'll talk about whatever Zaslav is doing a little bit later. We'll be right back. (upbeat music) - [Narrator] Support for the Vergecast comes from Mint Mobile.

(robotic sounds) - We're back and we have the most breaking news of all. In the middle of our break, literally in the middle of our break, Google put up a blog post announcing the developer preview of desktop windowing on Android tablets. I know that the audience is as lit up by this as we are, but I have to tell you, this whole room got so distracted that we almost forgot to start the show again in the middle of the break, just looking at this blog post. - [Alex] It's a good blog post. - If you're a DeX-head, just know your empire is falling, crumbling brick by brick, as Google ruthlessly Sherlocks your entire operating system away from you. So basically you have Pixel Fold, which feels like one of the hotter phones going right now. David just got one. - Yep. It's sitting here in a FedEx box on my desk. - Liam has a Pixel Watch on right now. - And a Pixel Fold. - And a Pixel Fold 'cause he bought a Pixel Fold and now he's in the ecosystem. I'm seeing 'em. People are excited about this phone. And so Google, which has... Liam was trying to run the Pixel Fold on a desktop monitor the other day and it was the saddest thing I've ever seen-- - [Alex] It's adorable. - Truly the s... Like, no... Literally, no affordance for running with a keyboard in display. Like it's just, \"Here's your Pixel Fold.\" Like, \"Here's a mediocre Android tablet\" - [Alex] And it's still square. - It was still square, (indistinct). It was beautiful. Everything about it is great. As you know, Samsung has DeX. As Vergecast listeners know, Samsung has this thing called DeX, which is the desktop mode for its phones. There's a lot of weird DeX stuff going on. Literally different SKUs of the same phone in the Samsung lineup run different versions of DeX with different capabilities. - Samsung, baby. - It is just not a thing you can depend on. As someone who has desperately tried to live the DeX lifestyle, the only person I know who ever pulled it off successfully is Dan Seifert, our former reviews editor who now works at Google, because Google was like, \"Dan, can you explain \"what is going on Samsung device--\" - [Alex] Curious. - So I was gonna ask. - Yeah. - So there's a man named Dieter Bohn, who also works at Google who also was a big believer in window freedom, I would say. And then, Dan, America's number one DeX user. - Yeah. - Goes to Google-- - The one and only DeX user. - Yeah, listen. Still number one, man. Goes to Google. Does The Verge get credit for this feature? - Yes, this is us. This is our alumni. - Right? I feel like we did this. - I think that... And we don't, actually. We don't. I'm still... We're all good friends. We just learned to not talk about work anymore, which is weird for people that worked in media together, especially. We just don't. I see Dieter, we talk about anything else. So I don't know. I have no... We have no inside info and I maintain that line, 'cause I like talking to Dieter and he's my friend. So we just enforce this... We had to like learn what to talk about that wasn't work and/or gadgets. Very weird. So I don't know, but I'm just taking credit for it. I'm saying with no... Literally no evidence and actually, like, an ideological resistance to knowing. - [Alex] Yeah. - And a deep knowledge of that not being how it works. - Yes. - We're still taking credit. - [Nilay] We're still taking credit for it. - [David] Absolutely. - We will send our armies into your house and introduce desktop windowing. - Could not agree more. I'm into it. - So, okay, here's what's actually going on. It's just the developer preview right now. They're showing it mostly on a Pixel Tablet. I have to imagine that this is gonna be what will happen on Pixel Fold, which very much acts like a tablet when you unfold it. - [David] Yeah. - You can just freeform windows. You can just run Android like a desktop operating system. You pull a Chrome window down and it opens a window with a nav bar, and tabs, and navigation. - Like it should. - I think there's some weirdness here between what is a Chrome OS device and what isn't... The Google weirdness here is very powerful. - The Chrome OS team just saw this and is like, \"What the hell?\" - Or they're like, \"Aren't we on the same team?\" Who knows with Google? So there's some weirdness here about just the differences in between the apps. Like ChromeOS can run Android apps. Weird, that came to nothing, as most of these ideas generally come to nothing. But the idea that Google is taking a bigger step forward, in particular with the Fold, 'cause I don't think Android tablets as a thing really matter if they freeform windowing. But in particular with the Fold and foldable Android devices, that when you're closed, they act like Android phones, and when they're open, they have freeform windows that can be useful in a variety of computing situations. That's a big deal. - Right. - It feels like a big deal. They have to actually chip it, it has to work. But this is the thing that everybody wants, right? You just carry your phone to work and you plug it in, and it's a computer. We're a little bit closer there. - I'm sorry, I'm just looking at the desktop windowing thing they have, and it feels like the person, the sample they're using here, the person is lying about going to Tahoe. - [Nilay] The Ta... Oh, this is so Gemini can summarize it. - Yeah, the Tahoe debrief, and then behind that you see they've been Googling Tahoe. Interesting, interesting. - They're like \"Gemini, \"summarize this webpage about Tahoe \"in an email about my trip to Tahoe.\" - Like, Windows calling you out there a little bit. - That's good. I will say, yeah, you're right, that they're like on a video call, they're doing an email while they're searching for literally just the word \"Tahoe.\" A little weird. - A little weird. But these look... I don't know, I think these windows look nice. They seem to move smoothly and the little gifs we're seeing. - It's such a rising tide lifts all boats thing too because the biggest challenge for Android apps on Chrome OS, once they got past some of the like basic compatibility issues, has been that Android apps look like butts when they're big, right? Overwhelmingly, and this is a thing that Apple has had really good luck with over the years and it has served Apple really well, is making apps look good at different sizes. Google has struggled forever to get developers to care about anything other than the vertical size of a smartphone. And one of the reasons people like to build apps for iOS before they build for even Android smartphones is because the screen sizes are different. It's so hard to build a good Android app because you essentially have to build 100 of them that all look slightly different at slightly different orientations, at slightly different sizes. So the idea of there just being one software of one screen size is very appealing to people, which is why a lot of people like to build iOS apps. What Google has made an effort to do over the last few years, it has not done it exceptionally well but it has done it relatively well, is get people to build these more flexible apps that work at tablet size, and they work at smartphone size, and they work at the size of a laptop screen to run on Chrome OS. And so every bit of it that gets better on one of those makes it better for all of them, right? - Yeah. - So the Pixel Fold being good this year should be very exciting to people who own Chromebooks because it's gonna make people who make Android apps make them better for the Fold, which will make them better on the Chromebook. And every one of these pieces just gets better and better as time goes on, which I think like... And for this, again, I can't imagine there are that many Pixel tablet users out there in the world, but this is just a step, again, in that direction. - Dan's just so happy somewhere. I do have one question. Does Android design... Do they not have responsive design where you can just like, \"okay,\" you make it, and-- - They do... In this context, it's called adaptive. - Okay. - So they've been pushing that for a long time. - Yeah. - But adaptive is not a checkbox, right? It's not a thing that you say, that \"Make my app adaptive.\" You have to build it to be all of those things, and it takes work. - So they don't have a tool set that'll be like, \"Boop, boop, boop, boop, adaptive.\" - So they do. You'll see some apps... And this is why there are a lot of iOS apps that look the same on an iPad because you can basically just paint by numbers into a template and it'll do it at all the different sizes. And some folks do that, and that's fine. But if you want to build an app with different ideas about navigation, or different animations, or like... Literally, to load a page at all the different sizes an Android device can be is a challenge, especially if you care about how it looks and works. And then, you throw in all the different devices, and all the different screen refresh rates, and... There's just so many variables. But the sheer, raw, X by Y size of the app has been the biggest holdup for Google forever because it's a thing people have not invested in doing because Android tablets were not any good, Android apps on Chromebooks didn't work, and nobody cared about foldable phones. And so, as each one of those gets better, they all get better. And that's very cool. - Yeah. I think I'm just kind of surprised 'cause in web design, we had this whole moment where everybody was like, \"You can just download this little theme \"and it's a responsive theme, \"and it's gonna automatically resize it \"for anything you do.\" And the fact that Google's doesn't just have, like, \"Here's the lazy way.\" - Well, no, but somebody built that theme. - [Nilay] Yeah. - That's like, that theme doesn't just exist. - [Alex] yeah, yeah. - Well, if you listen carefully, that's the sound of every web designer listening to the show screaming. - Exactly. - You're welcome. I like to throw you off. - It's just a WordPress theme that just exists. - [Nilay] Yeah. - Yeah. I paid $40 for it on ThemeForest, thank you. - Taking our site from desktop, mobile, we had an Mdot site for a minute, to responsive was a nightmare. Just a pure nightmare. - Responsive design is really hard. It's really hard. It's gotten a lot easier because it has become so much more important, but it is really hard. - Well, I think my question is why doesn't Google do that work? - Actually, can I tell you a fun fact about responsive design? - I love a fun fact. - My fun fact about responsive design is that it was a Vox media designer, Scott Cullum, who invented some of the very first responsive design prototypes. - [Alex] Well, that's awesome. - Really? - Yeah, and he was like-- - [Alex] (indistinct). - He was like, \"Look at this thing.\" He was showing us stretchy web windows and I was like, \"Make our site do that.\" And then the office lit into flames (indistinct) for a long time. - That's awesome. - Yeah. See, that was live breaking gadget news on the Vergecast. We still... Our heart's still aflame when there's Android windowing. - [Alex] Yeah. - We're still where we came from. David, I think you think the next story is very funny. - I do think the next story is very funny. - All right, make the case, buddy. - Okay. So there was a debate... Well, let me back up. So there's some election happening in the United States... Actually, let me back up. So the founding fathers-- - Do we know where Trump stands on Android windowing? - He doesn't like it. - Which candidate do you think is more likely to use DeX in the office? - Neither! One of 'em is a lawyer, she's using like WordPerfect. - No, no, no, no, no. Tim Walz. - Mm. - Ooh, that's a good one. - Tim is definitely on like a Galaxy note just because he wanted the stylus. - Do you see what I'm saying? You can feel it. - And he refused to upgrade. - [David] Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Tim has a foldable keyboard in his backpack at all times. That feels exactly right to me. - JD Vance is like, \"Here's what I want to do. \"I want to nationalize iMessage.\" Like, that's where his brain is at. - By the way, have I told you guys about how we discovered very recently that JD Vance has a house right down the street from me and there's now a Secret Service motorcade that goes by my house almost every day? - Oh wow. - That's the whole story. That's it, that's all I wanted to tell you. - Cool. - There's now a park that is like the size of this room that's fake behind me that is now closed because it's too close to JD Vance's house, and that's how everyone in this neighborhood found out that JD Vance has a house here. - But he's never there. He is walking into donut shops across America, confusing the population. - Apparently one of them might be in my neighborhood. I'm gonna have to start walking into donut shops every day just to see if I can find JD Vance. Anyway-- - Let's talk about these earrings. - So there's a debate. Kamala Harris was wearing earrings and that became tech news because there was a set of people on the internet who advanced a clearly not correct theory that the earrings she was wearing were actually headphones. And I brought this up for two reasons. One, because it's not true, and this is like a thing that people have tried to do for years. The idea that the candidate who does well in a debate is being fed answers in some way, shape, or form is a long running conspiracy theory that's never proven true. But B, I think it's very funny that the earrings in particular that she's being accused of wearing, there's some strong evidence that they don't actually exist. This is a Kickstarter company that doesn't really seem to have shipped. In fairness, we have not covered this company closely so maybe there's more out there. If you are an owner of Nova H1 headphones, get at me. I have a lot of questions. I wanna know everything. - I believe you mean audio earrings. - Oh my God. - You're right, I apologize. The H1 Audio Earrings. They just aren't what she was wearing. - Yeah, they look very different. - It would've been funnier if everybody was like, \"She's wearing Beats,\" but they're like, \"She's wearing a Kickstarter project.\" - The only similarity is they both have a pearl on them. Like, they're pearl earrings. That's it. Everybody's like, \"Wow.\" - The fact that the CEO is out there being like, \"I can't confirm or deny \"that these are our fake earrings,\" is like, \"Well, one, what are you doing?\" - The fact that the guy who can't ship his product is saying that? - [Nilay] Yeah. - And also, the battery life only lasts two and a half hours, which means they probably would've died mid-debate if we're being realistic, - She's putting 'em on right before she goes out. - Yeah. - \"Just give 'em to me, let's go.\" - She takes off her earrings mid-debate, puts them in a charging case, takes 'em back out. - There was a very funny... In the Engadget days, way back when, when Obama was first elected, there was all these reports that he wanted to keep his Blackberry. I don't know if you remember this. It was like frothing at the mouth, \"Will Obama get a blackberry?\" And then there was all this stuff about he would need a secret Blackberry that was ultra locked down. And he really wanted his Blackberry. And there was this company that made a phone called the Sectera Edge, and the CEO of that co... I don't remember what they're called. I don't know what the... I refuse to remember. But the CEO of this company is this military vendor guy, and he's just like on all the TV channels being like, \"the Sectera Edge is the most hardened, \"military grade, blah, blah, blah.\" And everyone's like, \"Obama's getting a Sectera Edge.\" And definitely not. He ended up with a Blackberry 8000 that was just stripped of its apps. And then, later on, he had an iPad. And it was like, \"Why did we spend so much time talking \"about the Sectera Edge?\" I think Josh Topolsky had a post in Engadget during those days where he was like, \"It's not the SuperPhone 9,000, \"it's a fucking Blackberry.\" That was like the headline. - It's pretty good. - [Nilay] Yeah. - I'm learning so much about... They were not technically smartphones. - The Sectera Edge? - Which was made by General Dynamic. - Yeah, see? I knew! \"He's like \"Here's what we do. \"It's cruise missiles \"and this weird feature phone \"for the government.\" - Well, that was like, remember the Boeing Black? That Boeing was like \"We made \"a super secure smartphone.\" - They were PDAs! - This was a whole... It's a whole genre floating out there. - There were many stories during the Trump era that I spent much too much time focused on. Foxconn in particular. But I don't know if you remember, they would always describe him as having a super TiVo in the White House. - Oh yeah. - Trump would watch like his super TiVo, and he kept referring to it as a super TiVo. And America's political reporters are not gonna be like, \"What's a super ti...\" Like, I get it. But I was like, \"What's a super TiVo? \"I've had every TiVo that's ever shipped. \"Which one is it? \"Is there a... \"That company is now a patent-licensing troll. \"Which TiVo is it, dude?\" And it was just a bog standard DirecTV box. And one time, someone published a photo of the super TiVo remote and it was a $4 white DirecTV remote. - But somebody painted a racing stripe on it, so that like super TiVo. - It was just like, \"Dude, he's got DirecTV.\" I'm aware that it can record four channels at once, but so can everything. - Honestly, I think if DirecTV had rebranded as super TiVo, it would probably have been more successful. - The one Trump has. Senior citizens of America, you can all have DirecTV together. - It's a remote, but it has the cover on it so you can only hit two buttons just to make sure. - It is very sad that everybody just assumed Kamala Harris's earrings were earbuds. - Do you think Tim Walz has ever backed a Kickstarter? That's my last question for you. - 100%. - I mean, JD Vance backed a Kickstarter to overthrow the government of the United States. Let's move on. - There you go. - I will cop to getting this wrong at the top of the show. I said it was Honor because Honor has also been hinting at a tri-fold smartphone, but it's actually the Huawei Tri-fold smartphone. It's $2,800. It looks sick! Again, Huawei got booted outta the country, you will recall, and almost went outta business because we wouldn't sell them chips. There's a whole thing that happened with Huawei. - They had to make their own operating system. - They had to start all over. And now, they're like three screens and everyone's kinda like, \"What if... \"What if we let Huawei back in the United States?\" - Yeah, I want this. The world's first dual-folding triple screen. - So it's the Mate XT. It is-- - Ultimate Design, please. - It's called the Mate XT Ultimate Design. They announced it on the same day as the iPhone, which is very good. It's very expensive. It's $2,800, thereabout, depending on the conversion factor to Yuan. That's 250 gigs of storage. Our story points out that's $300 more than a 16 inch MacBook Pro. - How many times can I fold up my 16 inch MacBook Pro, Nilay? - All of the videos, all the assets, all the content that Huawei has released is just the thing unfolding and showing people looking at presentations. - Somebody got a hands-on with it though. - Somebody has a hands-on? - Yeah. So Gizmo China got a hands-on with it and put in a couple of additional specs. It's only a little thicker than the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold. And it looks like... You can watch this video, we'll put it in the show notes. It looks thick. The camera is huge. - Yeah, that is a big camera bump. - That's a big boy. - Oh, there are more... I'm looking now on YouTube. There are more Chinese hands-ons with this thing that are starting to trickle out, but they're all just the thing unfolding. - Yeah. - That's the only content that exists is a very controlled demo of a thing unfolding. - What else do you need to know? That's the whole job. - Well, here's I-- - Well does the operating system do anything when you turn it into a sheet of paper? - Ah. - We need to see before and after. Don't worry about the process. - So one of the things that I am very curious about in this next turn of phones, we've been talking a lot about Pixel Fold, it seems to be very popular amongst the gadget population. Whether it's going to move Google's market share at all... It won't. But if you're a particular kind of gadget nerd, it is the device that everyone's talking about and into lately, which is interesting. It feels like folding phones that bifold, they've reached a point where now they're just maturing in iterative steps. - [Alex] Yeah. - Right? Compared to where the Galaxy Folds started. - Which means Apple will have one next year. - Maybe. Yeah, Pixel Fold's still... You can still feel the seam. It's not perfect, but it's right in a way-- - You can see that little crease when you open it, still. - Yeah. And you can definitely feel it with your finger. But it's hit that point, and so now are we just at, \"Okay, add another one?\" - Yeah. - Do we think... I mean like I under... The Chinese phone market and the Indian phone market are full of these ideas. - Yeah. - Like, do bonkers hardware stuff and see what happens. Markets around the world are generally more open to weirdness just because of the way our carriers are and Apple's iMessage domination. They're all... A bunch of Vergecast stuff that means we don't get cool phones first. - Oh no, this one video has the guy actually folding it and then you watch it all realign itself. - Yeah. - It looks cool. - I mean, Huawei did have to build their own operating system because, again, we... The amount of sanctions the United States government put on Huawei just changed the direction of that company. That's fine. But it just seems like this is a weird... You look at this, you look at how people are excited about it in a way that the first set of foldables didn't really capture, but now maybe the technology is mature enough. - See, I think there's also... There's a weird cultural element here too, because we're seeing all of these things happening in other countries and the United States is so focused on the iPhone, and the iPhone is so stuck in glass slab land. And like Google... It's really nice that Google's coming in but Huawei's been doing this for a while. A lot of the... Xiaomi's been doing this. A lot of these other companies have been doing really, really cool stuff with phones that just don't come to the United States. In many ways, it's less like they're doing weird stuff. It's more like we're getting a little left behind. - Yeah. I mean, again, it's so hard to break into the US smartphone market because of the essential duopoly of Apple and Samsung that the carriers have more or less enforced. - Would you-- - So it goes. I've talked... We've talked about this so many times. - Yeah. - But I'm just wondering, from a hardware perspective, do we think the regular folding phones have reached their sort of like-- - Yeah! - \"We're done with this. \"We don't need to figure out \"any basics here. \"Now, we're just--\" - Yeah, 'cause I think a lot of people are... Folks are comfortable with that little crease. It doesn't seem to bother people that much. And they figured out the front of the phone, right? With the Pixel Pro, that was the thing everybody really liked about it, is that they figured out the front. So you can just use the phone as normal. You never even have to open it up. But then, when you do wanna have a good time... - Yeah. - [Alex] You open it up and enjoy yourself. - [Nilay] David-- - For a good time, open up your phone. - David, you have long... - [Alex] Take me out of this. - You have long insisted that it'll be the flip style. - Yeah, I-- - Does seeing a triple fold change your mind? - It should. - No, I think the triple fold is an interesting tablet replacement way more than it is an interesting phone replacement. I think phone that turns into smartwatch is a way more compelling thing to most people than tablet that turns into phone. But to your point about the hardware, on one level, we are getting there. This stuff is pretty good. There's work left to do. They need to get more rugged, the cameras need to get better, the screens need to continue to improve, the whole thing needs to get thinner and lighter. These phones are big. They're big! And there's a lot of work left to do. But in terms of like, \"Can you make a phone that kind \"of works open and closed?\" The answer to that is yes, right? And I think we've landed on... Especially with this last generation, Samsung has gotten closer to the right size, One Plus is getting closer to the right size, Google is seemingly very close to the right size. I think what you're seeing from a lot of these companies, and Huawei and Xiaomi and others have done this for years, is unbelievably cool, really high-end tech demos, that like... They don't think a lot of people are gonna buy this phone but it gets people excited. It's a branding exercise as much as it is an actual phone to sell to humans. - I disagree. It's so cool-looking. - It is $2,800. - It's 2,800... Look, you put that on like a 10 year-- - What about what I just said makes you think it's not? The whole point is that it's cool-looking. - Yeah, a 10 year plan paying $30 a month, this would be great. - Didn't you just complain about the PS5 Pro's cost? - Shh. If it could fold like an accordion, I would I take it all back. If it was like big GPU but also folded like this, yeah. - Yeah. - You put the motion in, I'm sold. - No, I do think we're gonna hit a point where people start doing even weirder stuff with this, but also there's a thing that's coming that is a lot of new, wacky experimenting in phone hardware, and I'm very excited about it. It got stagnant for so long. And then a couple of people tried folding phones and it didn't really work, and I think everybody decided maybe this isn't gonna be the thing and now it feels like it might be the thing. And I think nothing is gonna beat the candy bar phone anytime soon, if ever, but the experimentation is coming back and I think that's awesome. - Yeah, I mean, the iPhone 16 Pro Max is 6.9 inches, almost seven. We're starting to strain the boundaries of how big a phone can be before it has to fold. - I wanna accordion that immediately. - I haven't f... The first thing I did in the hands-on area was just fold one up. That list of things you said about what folding phones need to get better, they need to be more durable, the screens need to be better, that's the same list of qualities that you could have applied to the first iPhone. - [David] Oh, for sure. - Right? And so, it's just they're on the same path, right? And that's what I mean. We figured out the core technology and now we're just iteratively improving around the edges to get them even better. That feels like a moment. I'm not sure where that moment's gonna lead to. The fact that we're like, \"Screw it, two screens fold out,\" kind of feels like maybe they figured out how to get one screen to fold out, and that now we're just seeing what else we can do. - Put another fold in. - I'm just... I am dying for the three screen phone. It's so dumb. - Well, I mean, just think about the difference in how the screen looks and feels from the first Z Fold to now, right? Just the sheer amount of materials science improvements that have been made to get to this point is crazy. Those things were like plastic and was it... It was Dieter, right, who accidentally peeled part of the screen off, thinking it was a screen protector? That was not that long ago. - No, no, Dieter had a tiny amount of dust in his review unit that broke the screen. - Oh that's right. - And then, somebody else peeled off the screen protector. - Okay, okay. - And then Samsung delayed the launch of the first Z Fold. - That was not a long time ago. - [Alex] Four years ago. - And now... Yeah, at the speed with which that stuff... And that was always the gating factor, right? The question was not, \"How do you build a good hinge?\" It was, \"Can you make a screen \"that works like this?\" And \"works\" means a lot of things. But I think the answer to that is \"Yes\" and \"We're almost there.\" And so, I think you're right that the path now is way more about software, and it's way more about use cases, and it's way more about details. And again, it's way more about, \"Do people actually want this?\" Which also is \"Can you make this thing \"for $800 and not $1,800?\" - Yeah. - And those are like... Those are big hills to climb. But they are, I think, like... I don't know, to just ruin the analogy. They're like hills you can see the top of. Whereas I think not that many years ago, \"Can we make this screen not fall apart?\" was genuinely, I think, kind of up in the air. - And now you can just do a little accordion. Just boop boop. - You just walk up to any phone you see and fold it in half, and see-- - Dude, I'm telling you. There's one shot run this Huawei video where it's open on two, so it just looks like a normal foldable phone. And then, he just kinda reaches below and pulls up the third part, and the UI just gloriously expands. - Yeah, - I've watched that 25 times since we've been sitting here talking. It's awesome. - It's sick. - It's coming. I'm telling you, it got more attention from a certain audience on iPhone day than the iPhone. - Yeah. - There's something to that. All right, I wanna end by putting two Google stories together, right next to each other, 'cause I think they're kind of really interesting when you put 'em right next to each other. We've actually talked a lot about Google on this episode. They seem, in one way, to have a bunch of confidence. And maybe that confidence is just like, \"We have to put Gemini in front of you, \"so here it is.\" But we reviewed the Pixel Watch 3 this week. V reviewed it, she gave it an eight. People like it. - Yeah. - People really like this watch. It is a confident product. The integrations across the Pixel and Google ecosystem are solid. We've been talking a lot about the Pixel 9s. For all of their general issues with swerving reality into chaos because of their just absolute nihilism about AI image editing, they're good phones that people like. - [Alex] Yeah. - And the Pixel Watch 3 is a good watch that V really likes, and I think people who buy into the ecosystem are gonna really like it. There's something happening on that side of the house for Google. - Yeah. - Where they've fallen into a groove. The hardware is good. There's a thesis in the software, even if the... Every time you pick up a Pixel phone, it's just like \"Gemini?\" There's still a thesis. There's there's a point of view, which I think is very strong. They haven't had a point of view for quite a while. That's that side of the house. On the other side of the house, well, their search engine just got ruled to be a monopoly, and they're on trial again right now for antitrust for their ad tech stack. And the... There's trial, that's witnesses, there's documents. Lauren Feiner's in the courthouse, covering it for us. It's all very boring. It's a bunch of suits talking about display ads on the web. If you want to go to sleep, programmatic advertising is the thing to talk about. But what's fascinating is, one, in all the documents, all witnesses, the way Google's business people talk about its business is ice cold. - Oh, yeah. - Right? - [Alex] Yeah. - There's no Google cuddle bugs there. - [Alex] No. - At all. It is literally \"How do we own this market? \"Here's the value. \"The value is...\" There's a line in one of the emails that's like \"The value here is \"that we own everything. \"That's the thing that makes this powerful, \"is we own every part of the stack.\" And so, they're just saying it out loud. And then, you have the clients, the actual people buying advertising, being like, \"Google's technology here is bad. \"We're just stuck with it.' - Right. - Yeah. - And the core ad tech server that Google's been using to serve all the programmatic ads all over the web, they're like, \"This is bad. \"This is like 20-year-old technology \"that we would like to get away from, \"but we're stuck with it \"'cause there's nowhere to go.\" And that is a weird dynamic for Google, right? On the one hand, they... With the AI stuff, with Gemini, maybe they got caught on the back foot, but it provided some amount of focus for the company, it seems like, and it's reflected in these Pixel devices. I think you can see it. There's a reason for them to be the way they are. - Yeah. - Which is really interesting. I don't know... If not for Chat- GPT, would the Pixel 9 had this much focus? I don't know the answer to that question. They weren't on this path all by themselves. It took this weird diversion from OpenAI to bring them here, but it worked. And then, on the other side of the house, the money, people are like, \"This is a monopoly. \"We don't like using this technology.\" And it feels based on what happened in the search trial, the government knows how to beat Google. This is the case, I would remind everybody, that Google tried to avoid in jury trial by just sending a check to the United States government for what it calculated to be the maximum amount of damages. - Yeah. - Like, on its Wells Fargo account, they're just like, \"Here's some millions of dollars. \"Is this good?\" We'll put it in the show note, there's a picture of the check. You can just look at the check. Google sent a check. - That's how Monopoly works, right? - Here you go. Like, literally how Monopoly works. They were so desperate for this not to be happening, that they just wrote... They just fronted the money for a settlement. And so, I just... I would just juxtapose those two things. I think it's... You see this company kind of at war with itself a little bit 'cause the thing that is funding everything is at all of this risk, and the future is coming into focus over here. - Except that, in so many ways, so far, all of Google's future stuff has just been ancillary to the other thing, right? I think the most damning critique you could make of everything Google has done in 25 years is that it actually doesn't care about anything but search. And so, everything gets subjugated to the needs of search. The people who build Chrome will tell you they could have built a better browser, except that what they had to do is optimize for search queries, which is a weird thing to have to optimize for in a web browser. And so, like... And this is a story you hear over and over from Google, is everything eventually loses at the hand of the search team. And I think you could make the case that the only team as powerful at Google as the people who make the search engine are the people who make the ads, and that is who is now being thrown into this fight. And to your point, the thing we say a lot on this show is that what happens at one trial has very little to do with what happens at the next trial, and I think that's probably true in Google's case here too. All this stuff is still very up in the air. But the thing we heard over and over in the last trial was Google's argument was, \"Google is very good, \"which is why we keep winning. \"And it's very hard to argue \"that there are better products \"out there than Google.\" And yet Google still lost because the argument came up over and over that actually what Google is doing is preventing that from happening, right? That maybe the reason there isn't more competition for Google is because Google has not allowed it. And Amit Mehta, the judge, was very receptive to that argument. This one, in which the overwhelming thing seems to be \"Actually, this sucks \"and there's nothing anybody can do about it,\" is like... Even the way Lauren was covering the first couple of days, you get the sense that the people accusing Google of being monopolists are very confident coming into this. And how that means it'll go, who knows? But there there is a real sense of like, \"The argument is extremely strong \"in this particular case.\" And it's gonna come down to market definitions, as it always does. And it's gonna get deeply wonky. And I'm going to court at least once next week, and I could not be more excited to listen to people yell at me about ad stacks for weeks. But yeah, it is... Google is both feeling itself and fighting for its life all at the same time, and it's very odd. - I feel like I, I need to disclose here. We have ads on our website. - What? - That we have... It's true. - [Alex] Oh my God. - And Vox Media's president of revenue and growth, Ryan Pauley, is on the list of potential witnesses in this trial. Well, I haven't talked to him about it. I don't know if he's gonna get called, he's just on the list 'cause we run a... We run a programmatic ad network called \"Concert,\" theoretically competes with Google. That's not... Truly not our side of the house. It's all the way over there. - I love never thinking about that. - Ryan has great hair, I will say that. That's the one thing I know about Ryan Pauley. - He does have great hair. Agree. - But this thing where you say you're a... Anybody listening, pull over in your car and think about the internet. That's my instruction to you. Do you like the ads that you're seeing? There's a million companies, a million ad tech companies, that are like, \"We can make better ads.\" And all of them are like, \"And then you run into the monster \"and you give up.\" Most of those people flip the ad tech companies, or then they try to bundle 'em up to create a new monster, and they get rich. And then they live a healthy life on LinkedIn, complaining about the monster. They're well practiced at this. It's not like they're available to you. The reporting is easy to do. It's just kind of what you're really trying to sell an audience, even what I'm trying to sell to you right now listening, is like there's a reason ads on the internet are bad and it's because no one... The market is not actually competitive for better ad experiences. - Okay, but which is worse, ads now... The ad experience now or like in the 1990s where it would be a popup of porn that would then infect your computer? - Well, so in the 1990s, I was a teenage boy. - So you're like, \"That ruled.\" - That ruled. - I was a teenage girl. I was like \"Oh, no.\" - Early 2000s, like, this is great. This is what I was here for the whole time. - Can I just say one more thing on this before we leave this subject. One of the things I have been paying a lot of attention to, and I'm well aware that this is a giant generalization but it has really jumped out to me in reading some of these court documents so far, a thing you hear a lot from people in and around the tech industry is that like if you want to believe that in the early days of the tech industry, it was a bunch of well-meaning hippies who just like wanted to make the world a better place and then that eventually got morphed and ruined, they all blame the MBAs. They're like, \"A bunch of people graduated \"from Harvard Business School, \"and came here because they thought \"that's where the money was, \"and they changed the culture \"and they ruined everything.\" And boy, does that ring true when you read some of these documents. To your point about these people being ice cold, it's like, these are the MBAs. These are the people who are like, \"Oh, you wanna build a cool product? \"I don't care. \"That's not interesting to me.\" - \"We're in charge of this money machine.\" - [Alex] \"Make us money.\" - And that is the thing that runs Silicon Valley now. - And it's just very hard because Google does such a good job of, for the most part, being very cuddly. I think there's a reason Google still has one of the worst logos in world history. It's cuddly and dumb, and it still kind of looks like Marissa Meyer drew it herself, right? And there's a reason there was a slide in the YouTube off... This is a company that its entire image was friendly, and then in the background, Eric Schmidt, former chairman and former CEO of Google, just a few weeks ago, was like, \"Here's what I would do \"if I was running an AI company. \"I would steal everything \"and then have the lawyers figure out \"the copyright problem.\" And it's like, \"Oh, that's... \"'Cause that's what you did with YouTube.\" - Right. - Like, fully what you did with YouTube. Even though Viacom was dumb in that lawsuit and their own people kept uploading videos to YouTube in the middle of the copyright lawsuit, which is why they lost. It's a true story. But there's a ruthlessness inside of Google that I'm just seeing playing out right now. And the thing I'm pointing out in particular is, viewed a certain way, its products, the Pixel products in particular, have never been better. - Yeah. - Like, they're good this time. They have a point of view, they have clarity. And then, over here, the things that have been reliable Google ATMs are in chaos because of the regulatory pressure. And I'm just not sure how that plays out together. - That's what happens when you have the MBAs run stuff. - No MBAs on the Pixel team, please. - That's how you stay out of court. - You stay away. All right, we gotta take a break. We'll be back with a lightning round. (upbeat music) - [Narrator] Support for the Vergecast comes from Mint Mobile. These days, unless you've decided to live completely off the grid, in which case, I don't know how you're listening to this show right now, everybody needs a phone.

I will say that there are now ads on the YouTube. When you watch it on YouTube, there are some ads. Those are not official sponsors of the lightning round. The lightning round is still available to be sponsored. - There were so many commenters on YouTube who were happy for us that we finally sponsored the lightning round. I just wanna say thank you-- - And I reject your happiness. - To all of you rooting for us. (speaking over each other) - Give us money and then be happy. How about that? - I do get emails and I try to take the money, but I don't know how because it's not my job. I can't be like, \"I take Stripe.\" It's just not like a thing. All right, lightning around. Cranz, what you got? - You know how trucks are huge? This is actually kind of a sad one for you. - I do. - 'Cause I know you love a big truck. - Every time I see a Raptor now, I'm like, I'm... \"My baby.\" - But sometimes trucks are too big. - They're all... Not sometimes. - Many times, the trucks are too big. If they come up to my shoulders, I'm like five eight, that's too tall. The US is finally taking aim and they're proposing these new rules. And they were gonna use crash test dummies, but instead of for crashing, it's for pedestrians because-- - So we're gonna run the car into people, like crash test dummies? - [Alex] Dummies. - Okay. - Yeah, yeah. Just a little boop. I think that's really nice because a lot of the times now, we've been seeing these really big trucks, and then you see all of these YouTube videos and stuff of people in these really big trucks, and they can't see little kids in front of 'em. And it's like somebody should check that out. And apparently, the government was like, \"We should check that out.\" - And presumably, the only way to... - [Alex] To do that-- - Is to make the truck smaller? - Yeah. - I will never be able to describe to you why I just started imagining it's... It's The Beatles' Abbey Road cover, but it's four crash test dummies lined up like The Beatles. And then, just like a Cybertruck just comes and just floors all four of them. - That's... - And they're like \"Too big.\" - That's an AI prompt right there, David. - [Alex] Yup. - Coming soon to a Runway generator near you. - Just immediately what popped into my head. - But there is a lot of optimism about these rules. People seem to be really, really excited about it. It feels like it's a good first step. So it's... After all these years of just watching the trucks get huge, it's nice to be like, \"Hey, how about they don't get that tall?\" - So Nilay, you're a truck guy. Does this, like... Is this gonna piss off all the truck people? - Sorry, I just typed \"The Beatles' Abbey Road cover \"but it's crash test dummies\" into Grok, the AI image generator... It's so bad. This is what you get when there's literally no... I'll send it to you, David. When there's literally no safety standards on your AI image generator. That's why I picked Grok, because it won't stop me. - [Alex] Their heads are huge. - You were asking... Yes, as a person who once owned a truck and still thinks of my truck fondly... For example, when I use Grok to generate crash test dummies as The Beatles' Abbey Road cover, I think about moving back into the woods and driving my truck again instead of living in society. - What I wonder is do people buy the giant trucks because they're the good trucks and people want good trucks, so if they make the good trucks a little smaller, it'll be fine? Or have we gotten to a point where like, \"I need big truck \"and if can't have big truck, big mad?\" - No, actually, two things... There's two data points that refute the idea that people actually want the big cars. - This is what I wanna know. - Some people want big cars. One, the Ford Maverick is a small truck that is just selling like gangbusters. It's a hit... It's a hit product. And then, two, people are starting to import these Japanese Kei trucks. I actually saw one at the Apple event, driving down the road in front of Apple Park, and it was like an attention magnet. - [Alex] Yeah. - And then, they're just these little trucks. And the beds, they're still five and a half foot beds. The beds are about the same size as a full-sized truck. They're just small, right? So they're as useful but they're just small. And I think you're seeing a bunch of interest in small cars again, the market wants them. And then, you look around and all the cars are so gigantic. I think the pendulum just swings back and forth. There's tax stuff where you buy a car for your small business, you can write off the full depreciation that has pushed the dentists of America into buying giant SUVs. I think that stuff is coming to an end or changing in some way. And so, I just think like between the market, the regulatory pressure, and then just the reality of you get in a car that's so big, you need cameras to drive it... - That's too much truck. - It's getting weird, right? When the solution to \"You can't see children\" is \"We've put cameras all around the truck \"that can see the children for you,\" you're just in a weird spot. So I think... I look at like... I thoroughly enjoyed owning a Raptor, it was very fun, but I lived near no one. And every time I drove that thing into New York City, I encourage... If you ever have the opportunity to drive a Ford Raptor through the West Village at night, during dinner time when everyone's eating outside, listening to The Cure with open windows, take it. That was just a weird experience all the way around for everyone. Everyone was like, \"What is happening right now?\" That car is just incompatible with the city. It's incompatible with the suburb I live in now. It's just too big, which is why I got rid of it. And I just see a push... Particularly like the Rivian R3, that's a smallish car. - Yeah. - [Alex] Yeah. - And The Ioniq 5, the Hyundai Ioniq 5, it's actually big but they designed it to look like a small car. It's SUV-ish proportions but it's designed to look like a classic hatchback, and I think people are attracted to it. it's selling really well because it feels small, even though it isn't technically as small as it looks. So I just think there's more interest in smaller stuff, as opposed to just full on Yukon XLs. - You have to crawl into them. I was in... A friend got one of the big RAM 3500s, and I was like, \"Hold on, \"do you have like a step or something? \"How do I get into this thing?\" It was just nightmarish. - I do miss my Raptor very much. I'm just saying it one more time. I think about it all the time. That car ruled. I drove not at all. - Nilay's gonna go home and start asking Becky if he can buy a big truck before it's illegal to have a big truck. - No, it's fine. We have a very cranky Mustang instead. It's a good time. All right, David, what you got? - So mine is news that actually happened right after the Vergecast last week but I have been thinking about ever since, which is that Meta finally showed off what WhatsApp and Messenger are gonna look like now that they're being forced to interoperate with other chat networks. This is one of those things that has been sort of burbling forever. We've known that this is gonna happen because of some EU regulation that basically says any sufficiently large messaging platform has to interoperate with other messaging systems. But there's just a couple of screenshots that they showed off. One, they look great. You're gonna be able to either have separate or combined inboxes, the way you can have like multiple email accounts in one email client. Seems like obviously how this should work. Excited that it's gonna work that way. I always kind of thought they were gonna do, like, you have an inbox and then the Facebook side inbox thing that you have to go way out of your way to do. But they're actually seem to make it a sort of first party messaging system, which is very cool. And then, also, there's a screenshot that shows basically how you will set it up in each app. And Meta invented two messaging apps just for the sake of these screenshots. One is called Spruce and one is called Blurb. And I just have been... I have been designing and product managing Spruce and Blurb all week, and I have a lot of thoughts about them as messaging apps. - Which one do you think is better, Spruce or Blurb? - Spruce is like businessy. It's like... Spruce is kind of like where you go to like LinkedIn vibe. Blurb is like Yo, where it's just like... It's just down to clown on Blurb all day. - You just Blurbing all day? - We're just Blurbing baby, yeah. You just like, \"Yo, you wanna Blurb later?\" That has connotations, you know what I mean? - Well, no. In Yo, you could only yo. - Yeah. Well, okay, you're right. Blurb is more than Yo. - Got it. Okay, just be clear. - But you can Yo in Blurb, to be clear. Yo is a feature of Blurb. And two super Yos equals one Blurb. It's important to understand that. - I got it. I have an app in my phone called \"Bonk.\" - Yeah. - [Alex] Yeah. - Casey Newton got really excited about Bonk for a minute. - Bonk was Yo with Bonks. - Bonk was Yo with Bonks. Bonk was like... Bonk was like real time collaborative Yo. - All right. - Yeah. But I just think this is very cool. And as far as we can tell, all of this is just coming to the EU again. This fascinating schism happening between the experience of technology in the United States and the EU. And in many ways, the EU is going to be much cooler, and more open, and more interesting. But just the way this looks and the way this works has me actually excited about what messaging might look like, so I thought that was cool. - Yeah. By the way, the EU thing that you mentioned is, I think, is gonna be part of my solution to how to review the iPhones and talk about them, 'cause Apple Intelligence isn't coming to Europe. So we're just gonna make European iPhone content. Continental iPhone content. - I love this. - And then we'll make freedom-loving American content - [Alex] Bald eagles everywhere. - Yeah, where the iPhone is just constantly summarizing everything. It's like \"Text? \"Summarized.\" America. - All right, Nilay, what's yours? - Mine is more AI doomerism. - Okay. - But in a fun way. This is legitimately I think the most interesting AI product I've seen yet. - Do tell. - So Google has this thing called NotebookML. They've actually announced two different versions of this, this core idea. So Google has this idea, they've settled on this idea. They're gonna take all of their AI stuff where they can take a bunch of data, they have big context windows for their model, they can understand a bunch of documents, they have good voice synthesis, they own YouTube. Here's their idea. \"We're gonna take a bunch of documents, \"we're gonna turn 'em into a podcast \"with voices talking to each other.\" And so, they have one for scientific papers, which I believe we have access to but we haven't really tested very much. So inside of NotebookLM, which is their AI powered notes app that they announced... Last year, David? You're my notes... - It was last year. And it's like, imagine a feature that should be in either Google Keep or Google Docs, but isn't, and that's what NotebookLM is. - But it's in Blurb, from what I understand, - It is. You can blurb to NotebookLM for sure. Yeah. - Anyway, so in this app, you can give it a bunch of documents and it will just generate a podcast. Like, two hosts talking about your documents. And it is kind of remarkably convincing. - I'm sorry, I've been reading a bunch about this and it's like I can sort of understand it, but just hearing you say that sentence, \"You give it a bunch of documents \"and it can generate a podcast,\" I just want to like throw myself out of a window. - It's like a... People have been using it. The podcast host uses phrases like \"messy as heck.\" Like, they use idioms. It's just weird. And it's like, Google has had this idea twice now. You know that thing where creatures evolve to become crabs? It's like Google's AI efforts evolve to make podcasts out of documents. Like, simultaneously evolved twice inside of Google. I think it's utterly fascinating. You can use it now in NotebookLM. The weirdest one I've seen is Robert Stephens, who is the founder of the Geek Squad, the actual Geek Squad in Best Buy, the founder of the Geek Squad, Robert Stephens, appears to be a member of the Bennett Valley Community Association in Sonoma County, California. Apparently, the Bennett Valley Community Association has been having a lot of fights about whether to allow weed to be grown on farms there, like commercial cannabis growing. And so, he says he uploaded a bunch of docs, and meeting notes, and PDFs into this tool, and it just generated a podcast about this fight that, for all the world, sounds like a true crime podcast about whether or not they should grow weed in Sonoma County. Can I just play you the beginning of it? - [Alex] Please. - Yes, please. - [AI Man] All right, ready to dive into another pile of documents. - [AI Woman] Always. What do we have this time? - [AI Man] Well, today we're headed out west to Sonoma County, California. - [AI Woman] Oh, nice. Wine country. Ready for a vacation. - [AI Man] Not so fast. This isn't about a relaxing getaway. It's actually about a pretty heated controversy brewing in Bennett Valley. - [AI Woman] Bennett Valley. Okay, I'm intrigued. Tell me more. - [AI Man] So it all centers around commercial cannabis cultivation, seems like a lot of places have been grappling with this since legalization. - [AI Woman] Yeah. - Right? It's just like, he didn't write that script. - Wine country. - Here's just a bunch of weird minutes from board meetings and it made a... Now, is it accurate? Did it hallucinate the heatedness of this controversy? I don't know. - Did it hallucinate that the AI needs a vacation? Yeah, super did. Super duper did. Oh, God. - There's a part in here where it notes correctly... If you listen to it for longer, it notes correctly that the board's lawyers told it that its first attempt to ban cannabis cultivation would not work, so the board backed down and tried a new legal avenue. And the AI issues that as a criticism of the board, which is fascinating for a guy on the board to publish. But like, that's... To me, this is one of the most interesting uses of this tech that I've seen. No one is making podcasts about the Sonoma County weed controversy. It doesn't seem like there are only four subscribers to this YouTube channel. - Well, technically, someone did make the podcast. - Right, but no one-- - And no one listens. - I'm interested in, generally, can you make people more interested in the things that are happening in their community, right? - Yeah. - Every day, wherever you live, there is some board, or HOA, or town council that is doing stuff. - [Alex] Yeah. - And there's a desert of local news throughout this country. It's not being covered. If you can turn it into weird true crime podcasts, is that a actually useful service of AI? I don't know the answer to that question, but this is the most interesting thing that I've seen out of it yet. - Yeah. - All the same problems are there. Is it gonna hallucinate? Is it telling the truth? Can it be manipulated by the people who are making it to be favorable to one side or another? Is it accountable? These are just fake people. - \"Is it interesting \"to listen to?\" Feels like an important question. - Mm, wine country. - Well, so what I found, I think the reason that this sparks such interest to me is not the wine country. They actually were telling a story. - Yeah, no-- - like, as you go into it, they're like, \"Here are the stakes. \"Here's the back and forth. \"Here's a thing that happened. \"Here's the next thing that happened.\" - This is legitimately, like... They constantly do this tell a story thing where they're like, \"You're just driving in your car \"and your kid's sad in the back, \"and you just have the AI tell it a story,\" and that's always stupid. - [Nilay] Yeah. - This is actually like an interesting use case of it. - Right, 'cause there's things that actually happened. - Yeah. - And again, do I know if AI's... I'm not deep in... I'm not deep in Bennett Valley's weed controversy. - Not yet. - I'm gonna be. But it's just interesting that, one, Google announced it. This is... Again, they've come up with this idea twice now inside of Google. And then, two, people are actually using it, right? This is someone who is on this board, who is dealing with this controversy, who's like, \"I tried this out. \"This is good enough to share,\" right? To me, he thinks it's good enough to share. I think other people are gonna use this in other ways. Is this gonna make good podcasts? I don't know. Is this the most interesting sort of, \"How do you get people to consider things \"in their like local community \"that they would not have otherwise considered\" attempt that I've seen in quite some time? It sure is. Now, do I think that this works for every case? 'Cause NotebookLM, well, you just do anything. You can put any random assortment of documents in there. I'm very excited to put any one of our legal decisions in there... Like the Google antitrust decision. I wanna make Google make a podcast on it, right? I'm very... Are they gonna do a better job than we do? But there's just something about all of the LLM stuff, where all it's ever really doing is playing with language, right? We've enabled natural language input, we've enabled computers to use language in ways they couldn't do before, where it's actually this kind of thing that feels like the most interesting use case. I don't know that this use case can support the hype or the investment, but actually \"We can make your local politics \"somewhat more digestible to you,\" it's the first time I've ever been like, \"All right, there's something going on here \"that seems interesting \"that doesn't seem like massive copyright theft \"and the end of reality,\" which is how I usually evaluate these things. - Well, the challenge there is, \"Can you have this use case \"without all that other stuff?\" - Yeah, I know. - But I agree, it is an interesting use case. And I also... The other news of this ilk that came out this week was OpenAI released o1, its new like reasoning-capable model. - It looks like an emoji. - First of all, terrible name. OpenAI said to Kylie Robinson, who wrote the story for us, they were like, \"Oh, we think our names are bad. \"We tried to reboot it.\" You did bad, again. Sorry, OpenAI. \"o1\" is nothing. But one of the things that it does is you ask it a question and because it's a \"reasoning model,\" it takes longer to answer because it's just doing more steps at a time. But it will walk you through the steps that it's taking. And Kylie included this screenshot in which it's saying things like... This is the model reporting back as it's talking... As it's thinking aloud. \"I'm curious about defining variables \"to translate the problem into algebra.\" And then a minute later, \"I'm thinking through a new variable \"to measure time \"and establishing clear definitions \"for years in the past.\" And like, we're still down this road of making these things seem sort of human. It's like when you talk to Siri and it goes, \"Hmm.\" Or \"Um.\" And it's like, \"Is this what we want?\" - It's the most irritating thing in the world. I'm like, \"You're fake.\" - Like, do I want the AI to pretend to be a person? - No, because-- - And I feel that same way, listening to this podcast. I'm like, \"What are you... \"What are you here for?\" - I want all of them to go and watch a whole... One of the Star Trek series because they actually do interact with computer. The computer's not irritating in it. It's like, \"Hold on, let me process that.\" - Tea, Earl Gray, hot. - Yeah! Done! - The tea machine is not like, \"Hmm, I'm thinking about \"which blend you might be.\" - I've always wanted to just communicate only in nouns and adjectives. - [Alex] Yeah. - Very good. I will say just to... The people are gonna yell at me 'cause I said something nice about AI. I'll say something doomer about AI, which is Meta has taken the AI labels off of Instagram, or they're hiding them in a menu, because none of that was ready, none of it worked, no one has any point of view, and LOL nothing matters. They just gave up. We have just given up on this. We're doing AI generated images of Elon Musk and Taylor Swift having a cat baby. That's a real picture that I saw this week. Why? Why? The end. - There we go. You said it all. - This is like the real plus and minus of AI right now. Like, \"Oh, maybe this will help people engage \"in their local communities.\" \"I will have to see this picture \"and there will be no label on it \"because no one figured out \"how any of that works, \"and maybe it never will.\" That's it, that's The Vergecast everybody. - Yay. - Fold your phone in half. - Any phone. It doesn't have to actually be a foldable. - Just get out there and start folding phones in half. - Brute strength. - Rock and roll. (upbeat music) - [Narrator] And that's it for The Vergecast this week. Hey, we'd love to hear from you. Give us a call at 866-VERGE11. The Vergecast is the production of The Verge and Vox Media Podcast Network. Our show is produced by Andrew Marino and Liam James. That's it, we'll see you next week.",

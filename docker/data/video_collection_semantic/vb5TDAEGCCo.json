    "transcript": "oh hello good people exactly how good our cheap gaming peripherals here I have the Rival 3 Mouse and Apex 3 keyboard from SteelSeries both of these together cost just as much as a single razer viper mouse unfortunately this is not a mechanical keyboard but it's got whisper-quiet switches i'm excited to test them out so exactly how good are these let's find out whisper quiet indeed and so the apex 3 keyboard is a basic full-size layup with the same frame as their higher end stuff that includes a soft touch magnetic wrist rest all for $49 while the rival 3 mouse is also quite bare-bones at 29 now I find it weird that SteelSeries are not exactly competing within the lightweight market but the good news is that the rival 3 is significantly lighter versus the sensei 10 which was the latest Mouse they launched and so that looks like they're on the right track I have both keyboard and mouse setup for some games let's see how this $80.00 combo stacks up in the real world right after this want to step up your airflow game look no further than the master fan SF 120 M from Coolermaster featuring a damping frame designed to ensure stability a connected fan lane design for optimal cooling performance and an anti vibration motor that ensures better acoustics it's very simple to install and it comes with three fan speed controls check it out down below alright so the first thing I want to cover is the mouse because the rival 3 at $29 is actually impressive it's the same shape as the rival 110 so it's not new it's in the same size category as the G Pro here for example and quite similar to my mm 711 from Coolermaster with a slightly longer body it is an ambidextrous shape but for right hand use only with surprisingly good build quality that actually feels better than that of the mm 711 as for body shape I fingertip this one very well and the slight flaring of the bottom of the body helps with some placement and overall I feel like this would be a comfy Mouse for medium to large hands and it's also pretty light Mouse at 77 grams I'm not sure if this is the lightest Mouse from from steel series but let's say the sensei 10 was like 89 grams so they're definitely moving with market trends amazing on the weight of mice for the better however the cable is quite bad with hard to remove kinks and is not so soft but the glide feet make up for it with smooth motion that feels better than my 711 this is the rival three and probably the most surprising thing about this mouse is the illumination it is very good and can even be customized in three zones with smooth transitions and nice surface bill - we often see this level of lighting on more expensive mice so the added bling for $29 is definitely appreciated the scroll wheel is low-profile with soft but distinct scroll steps and like meta click awesome for 29 bucks the primary switches are rated at 60 million with satisfying quiet actuations with less than usual travel distance take a listen and finally probably the reason why this mouse is so cheap is because of the sensor but they didn't cheap out on the quality of it so it's still an optimist sensor but it's a budget derivative of their true move pro sensor this one goes up to 85 hundred dpi adjusted in 100 increments and with up to five profiles but still delivering that true one-to-one tracking throughout the entire range and honestly it's a very good performer however the lift off distance detection is slightly higher than I'm used to which means that if you like to lift off your mouse off the mouse mat at lower dpi settings and when you place it down there will be a little bit more that cursor jiggle when the mouse is about to hit the surface then more high-end mice that have much lower lift off distance but seriously at $29 I'm impressed and the only thing that's trash here is the cable however they use the same cable on all of their other mice so it's not really technically a downgrade for the rival three and that's for the keyboard yeah this thing is actually pretty decent too but only for a specific audience so the price point for example is fairly low in the budget territory but it's not exactly meant to compete with mechanical keyboards because there do exist options that are $50 and are full on MX chair and mechanical so instead if you're after the rubber dome switches for the sound profile and still resistance then the apex 3 is okay in that regard so the wrist rest is very comfy and magnetic but the coating isn't very oil friendly so don't to wipe it once in a while the 3-way cable routing is appreciated the single step height adjustment is present along with an awesome volume wheel that is super responsive and the multifunction button is here as well and just as with the mouse illumination on the apex tree is pretty gorgeous all thanks to a white under plate that helps to diffuse all that color it looks great in either static or rainbow effect by the 10 zone customization is kind of a joke as the transition areas between colors look awful the switches used here are still series new whisper-quiet low friction 20 million rated keystroke switches with the soft resistance at the top that's kind of like a tactile brown but not as smooth when it comes down I actually don't mind the operation and character of the switches even when you bottom out because they are heavily muted so for night gaming it's a pretty good alternative take a listen now the key caps are standard abs plastic with clean font I appreciate that but are not interchangeable due to the nature of the mount itself that is also the reason why the keyboard is rated for water resistance as unless you actually submerge it in water no liquid should find its way on the Dickie cap so how is this trio combo in the gaming environment satisfactory the mouse performed very well I'm on 800 dpi now and it felt quite similar to my aim with a 7-eleven although much heavier and surprisingly I enjoy the keyboard as well the switches are heavier versus my cherry Browns by ducky so that was one major difference as I couldn't be as fast with the apex 3 as I can with my floor mellow or ducky keyboards but the sound profile was nice and quiet as advertised and so the mouse I can easily recommend it's a complete bare-bones package that is very competitive at $29 while the keyboard is a bit more tricky because g.skill and hype rags both offer MX chary keyboards for $50 but if you're after the whole quiet operation and some water resistance on your keyboard with a full size layout nice illumination and the wrist rest then the apex 3 I don't think it cuts any corners because it's not trying to compete with mechanical solutions and I would say it's a very good budget option to complement the rival 3 release all right thanks much for watching I'm curious to know if any of you play EFT let me know in the comments below maybe we can play together sometime check out this other rail and contents I'll be in the comments answering some questions I'll see you in the next video",

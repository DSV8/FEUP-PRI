    "transcript": "- Hey guys, this is how Marvel assembled the Avengers. Avengers Endgame releasing this week marks the end of an over decade long story that's been told over the course of 21 different movies. Yeah, there have been 21 different Marvel movies. While that's an achievement on it's own, it's easy to forget that by the mid-2000's Marvel had already sold off the film rights to most of it's biggest properties. The idea for the MCU started in 2005 when two Marvel employees, Avi Arad and Kevin Feige, decided to form Marvel Studios. Feige realized that while they couldn't make their own movies featuring Spider-Man or the X-Men, they had a good shot at re-obtaining the rights to the original core Avengers. After securing funding of over half a billion dollars, which was really impressive for a pre-Disney Marvel who had recently almost gone bankrupt, they set out to release individual movies featuring each of the main Avengers culminating in a cross over movie. We all know that the first true MCU movie was Iron Man, which came out all the way back in 2008 and that makes me feel really old. From around 1990 to 2005, the idea for an Iron Man movie was kicked around between Universal, 20th Century Fox, and New Line Cinema. Over the years people like Tom Cruise and Nicolas Cage said they wanted to play Tony Stark. And at one point, Quentin Tarantino, of all people, was asked to write and direct the movie. Tarantino's Iron Man would have made a great ultimate setup. - [Matt] I think Nick Cage would be a terrible Tony Stark. - As the script was passed from studio to studio, the story would always change. Like at first the Villain was going to be everybody's favorite secret Avenger, MODOK. [Matt] MODOK! [Austin] What is a MODOK? - He's basically like a big head in a chair with little arms and little legs and he's an assassin, he was built to be an assassin. One of Marvel's best characters. After the final attempt fell through in 2005, New Line Cinema just gave up and handed the rights to Iron Man back to Marvel, and they decided to scrap the decades of baggage and start from scratch. Jon Favreau was hired to direct the movie, but when filming began in 2007, the script wasn't actually finished. So he rolled with the punches and had Robert Downy Jr. improvise a fair few of his lines. It all came together in the end, though. And on a budget of $140 million, Iron Man grossed almost $600 million at the box office. With Iron Man a resounding success, Feige moved on to working on the Incredible Hulk with its rights holder, Universal. Louis Leterrier was signed on to direct and Edward Norton was cast as Bruce Banner. Norton was also signed on as a writer and he was still revising the script during principle photography. Because of that, Marvel decided to cut over 70 minutes of footage that included flashbacks to the Hulk's origin and a scene where Bruce Banner headed out into the Arctic to attempt suicide. - [Matt] Yikes. - Yeah, it got pretty dark. Surprisingly, The Incredible Hulk didn't fare nearly as well as Iron Man in the box office. On a budget of $150 million it barely managed to break even. - [Matt] Is that why we never got a Planet Hulk? - [Jimmy] Yeah, but at least we got Thor: Ragnarok. (Matt laughs) - And Korg. - Korg, I love Korg. (laughs) - Piss off, ghost! - Thankfully, Marvel had an easier time getting back the rights to Thor, Captain America, Black Widow, and Hawkeye, so after a few more standalone movies, the Avengers finally assembled in 2012, and they've grossed over $1.5 billion in the process. - [Austin] That's a lot of money. - Yeah, that's a lot of money. While Marvel worked on getting phase two out the door, they set their sites on reacquiring arguably their most noteworthy hero, MODK. - [Matt] MODOK! - Just kidding, dude, Spider-Man. Thankfully for Feige, Sony wasn't too happy about the largely terrible critical reception to The Amazing Spider-Man 2, so they entered a partnership with Marvel that would allow them to include Spider-Man in the MCU. But this actually ended up being a really weird partnership. Instead of Disney, Sony pictures is the financer and distributor of Spider-Man's standalone MCU movies, and they also have full creative control over the final products. So now you know why you've already seen trailers for Spider-Man: Far From Home, even though Peter Parker and Nick Fury got Thanos. That's all on Sony. So we've covered Iron Man, the Incredible Hulk, and Spider-Man, but I feel like we're forgetting a pretty big chunk of the Marvel Universe. - [Matt] Fantastic Four! - No, it's the X-Men. 20th Century Fox has owned the rights since 1984 and they've made 11 films since then that have ranged from terrible, with X-Men: The Last Stand, to incredible, with Logan and Deadpool. Even though the deal between Marvel and Fox was binding to the point that MCU characters couldn't even say the word mutant, there was still some gray areas that everyone benefited from. For example, both companies were allowed to use Quicksilver, which is why you saw him in both cinematic universes. They two companies even traded characters a few years back. Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 director, James Gunn, wanted to use Ego the Living Planet, who was a Fantastic Four character, and the writers of Deadpool wanted to use Negasonic Teenage Warhead, so they shook hands and made a swap, playground-style. - [Matt] Just traded like cards? - Yeah, like Pokemon cards. - Huh, that's nice. - Or Yu-Gi-Oh. - [Austin& Matt] Or Magic: the Gathering! - Yeah, or Magic: the Gathering. To get the X-Men back, Marvel raided Scrooge McDuck's vault and straight-up bought 20th Century Fox. And with that, one question remains, when will the X-Men join the MCU? According to Kevin Feige, at least five years. While you're waiting for that though, why don't you binge the entire This Is cinematic universe, starting with how Star Wars saved Lego. Make sure to subscribe and ring the notification bell so you don't miss anything. If you don't, Matt will have to watch Fan4stic instead of Endgame. - [Matt] What!? - Yeah, Josh Trank coming for you. - [Matt] No!",

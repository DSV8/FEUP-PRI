    "transcript": "Here it comes from the Vox Media Podcast Studios in New York, New York. It's the USBC Price is Right. Nilay Patel, come on down. We're gonna get sued. I'm so worried about it. Alex Cranz come on down. I can't afford to be sued right now. And David Pierce, come on down. I always thought I would do a cool dance if I was on the Price is Right. I was like, I had a whole choreography planned. There was a spin move. And here's your host, Liam James. Okay, welcome to the USBC Price is Right. I'm Vergecast producer, Liam James. We have a great game for you today, which will consist of four rounds, all themed around the latest industry standard connector for all your favorite gadgets. Well, Nilay, David, Alex, you should all know that each of you will be playing today for a Vergecast listener that we randomly pulled out of a hat. Let's hear who Nilay is playing for. This is James Alexander and my favorite USB C gadget has to be the very first one I ever got, a Nexus 6P. Greatest phone Google ever made. Thank you. All right, James. I'm in it. Yeah, it's a great pick, James. Nexus Hive, rise up! All right, let's hear who David's playing for today. Hey Vergecast team, my name is Kabir Ali, and my favorite USB C gadget is my ceramic burr grinder for coffee beans that I got on Amazon. Awesome gadget. Thanks so much, guys. Hope to win the competition. My fussy coffee, people! Let's go in here! I mean, let's go! We gotta go back and ask Kabir if his thing is actually USB A and doesn't have the resistors and can only charge from an A to C cable. David, you're my sworn enemy now, and Kabir, I don't know you, but you're dead to me. Uh, yeah, we'll put that in the follow up for the next show. Uh, but, for now, let's hear who Alex is playing for. Hi, my name's Terry, and my favorite USB C gadget is my Ventrue N4 Pro. It's a three channel, 4k wifi dash cam. I put it into my car. I have a Kia Soul. It's pretty awesome. Also, I would like, uh, Alex to represent me. Wow. Dude found his people. He's like, I've got a fussy dash cam, Alex. But he also has a Kia that, so his like insurance rate is more than his car. Don't get your car stolen. But he probably is a Kia boy. Are you a Kia boy? Yes or no? Is that part of the price is right? Terry, we need to know this information. Terry, let me know. Okay. Well, whoever wins, your listener will be sent an awesome, cool Verge swag basket filled with all kinds of goodies. All right. Is everybody ready? Let's go. We're ready. All right. The first round is, guess the price. Oh boy. Guess the price of each gadget. The closest guess without going over wins five points. Get within five dollars, get a bonus of five points. Let's get started with the first gadget up for bid today. It's a 1080p endoscopic camera for your Android or iOS device. Featuring a 2. 9 megapixel camera, six adjustable LEDs. This USB enabled tool is great for inspecting hard to reach places like car repairs, sewer maintenance, dryer vent inspection, and more. Made by Pansilin. Hmm. Can I ask a follow up question? Can we, can we spelling be this? Where can I ask for like, you know, language of origin? I just want to know how many megapixels was it? Two. Two megapixels. Okay. That changes everything. To 1080p. Okay. Whoever gets the closest to the retail price without going over gets the most points. Picked to go first before we started the show today is Alex Cranz. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh, what do I wanna do? 2, 2 48. Alex Cranz with $2 48 cents. Wait. 248, not 2 48 . Wow. Alex cran. Alex Cranz. Cranz with an overbid. . Alex cran . I believe it in me. It, look, it's, it's long. It's got a, it's one long wire look. It's at least 3 cents per mega. Per mega pixel. Yeah. $248. Okay. 248. All right. Uh, Mr. Pierce. Okay, do we have the thing where I can like look back at the crowd and ask them to guess for me? Uh, I, 59. 99. All right, David Pierce, 59. 99. And the thing on Amazon says it's usually 74. 99, but it's actually 59. 99. That's cheating. That's what I think. And Mr. Patel. Oh, this is very complicated now, because I think Alex is way too high and I think David's way too low. One hundred seventeen dollars. Yeah! That's a good number. You like Mattel? One hundred and seventeen dollars. Actual retail price is Twenty nine dollars, ninety cents. Let's go. I should have gone with it. I should have just kept my mouth shut. I could have won! Do not I don't Sorry, Terry! Look, my father was an emergency room doctor. Do not do that with things that cost 29. 90. Check for dryer lint? No, my dryer vents are going to be so clean. You guys will even know. Okay. That means all three of you actually bid over the retail price. So no points are awarded for this gadget. Uh, but let's get to the next USB C gadget for this one. If you all go over, we'll do another round of guessing. It's Rechargeable Heated Socks by Weston. These stockings will keep your feet warm all day with the power of two small batteries you tuck into a pocket sewn into the socks, which are rechargeable by the included USB C cable. Rechargeable Socks by Westin. Alright, contestants, currently on Weston website, these socks are actually 50 percent off. But at what price? Wait, what is the discount price or what is the regular price? What is the discounted price? Ooh, that's harder. I feel like this tracks with what David is saying is that these are probably never sold at the real price. Correct. Like you have to psychologically manipulate people into believing they're getting a deal in order to sell battery socks. 000. Yeah. And today they're 6. What a deal. For three easy payments of 29. 99. All right, uh, contestants, are you ready? We're ready. Okay, this time let's go with David Pierce to begin with. It's one pair of socks, yes? One pair of socks. 22. 49. Ooh. All right, David Pierce with 22. 49. Mr. Patel? I've learned my lesson. 11 flat. 11 flat from Mr. Patel and Ms. Cranz. Oh, see, because it's socks. Socks are sneakily expensive sometimes. So I'm going to go with 37. 96. You think the socks cost more than the camera? 37. 96 from Alex Cranz. Actual retail price is 79. 95. Oh my God. That makes our winner. That is the half off price. Wow. I told you socks are pricey. I got you, Terry. I'm just going to say this out loud. What I've learned from two rounds of us. The thing about USB C prices, right, is people respect some parts of their body much more than other parts of their body. They respect their dryer lint hole. You can get the USB A version of these socks for 199. Oh my god. I'm kidding, I totally made that up. Okay, let's get to our final gadget for Guess the Price. It's the FLIR One Pro Thermal Imaging Camera for Android Phones. This infrared camera mobile accessory has an adjustable USB C connector and lets you find hidden electrical problems, energy loss, water damage, and other heat related issues with its thermal imaging with the help of the FLIR One app by FLIR. Alright, contestants. That's so jaunty. Right now on Amazon, you can get this gadget for what price? I reviewed the, the lightning version of this in like 2017. Oh boy. Mm. And I don't think that's going to help me at all. You got to factor out the MFI tax. Yeah, I got to, I got to factor that. And also the many years since I last reviewed this. Yeah, inflation. What does Bidenomics say this is worth now? 4, 000. Okay. First we have Alex Cranz. Yeah. Ooh, I hate it. Um, 268. 268. 42. I feel like that's a good number. 207. 86. Mr. Patel. 207. 86. We have a last minute correction. David Pierce, what is your guess? One dollar. One dollar. Price is right, baby. Let's go. David's taking the entire middle range there. One dollar. All right, actual retail price is 420. 50. Oh my god. Why didn't anyone guess 420? Oh, I'm sorry. But wait, I still win, right? You do. You super won. Yes! Wow. You absolutely won. In fact, let's take a look at our scoreboard as it stands now. Rounding out the back is Nilay Patel with 0. I'm sorry, James. I'll send you a next one. This is five, man, no matter what happens. Joining him, uh, is David Pierce with zero. Kabir, I'm so sorry. Alex Cranz, our fearless leader, at ten. You get what you deserve, Kabir. It's all for you, Terry. It's all for you. Nothing. I can't send you an extra slot because it's mini USB. I'll figure it out. Get an adapter. Dongle it. Alright contestants, the next game we have for you is called the Match Game. Oh sweet Jesus. Match the gadget to its max wattage over USB C. Two points per correct match. Here, we have a list of ten USB C gadgets and ten of max power delivery stats in watts. As you all may know, power delivery is a specification on USB C that tells us how much power the gadget is allowed to receive for charging. Use your expert gadget knowledge to match each USB C PD number with the appropriate tech. Can I just say this is proof positive that USB C PD is Bananas, I'm just going to read you the, the, the numbers that are available. A hundred Watts, 45 Watts, 140 Watts, three Watts, 80 Watts, 18 Watts, 30 Watts, 96 Watts, 27 Watts, and 45 Watts. Many of these numbers. Are virtually the same universal standards, baby. Let's tell the audience what the devices are. First, we have the Nintendo switch from 2019. We have the iPhone 15 pro. We have the 16 inch Mac book pro them three. We also have the steam deck OLED model. We have the Dewalt DCB charging kit. We have the PS5 DualSense controller. We have the Samsung Galaxy S23. The OnePlus 11 5G, we have a 14 inch MacBook Pro, the M1 model, and finally the Pixel 8 Pro. Okay, everyone should have a worksheet we provided for them with all this information. Please match the gadget with the appropriate power wattage. You may start now. Again, I'm just going to point out it's 10 different devices, many of which are exactly the same category. In ten different numbers. Listen, Neal, I stopped stalling. Alright, I'm going. It's go time. Wait, is 45 on here twice? Okay. I'm ready. Shit. I didn't say I'm right, to be clear. I just said I'm ready. I will say, at the very least, my sheet looks like this, which is basically a conspiracy board. I have made mistakes here. Did you guys do the thing that I did where you get almost to the end and you realize the two highest ones you haven't done yet and all that's left are ones that don't need that much power? Yeah. Same. C, and I was like, C, C, C. Like, I didn't, I didn't. Forty five. Forty five. No, I think I nailed this. Actually, you know what? I nailed this. Let's go. All right. All right. We're going to have everyone self report, so we're using the honor systems here. All right, contestants, let's see how everybody did. We're going to take these one at a time, starting with the Nintendo Switch. At 18 Watts, that's a big, no, anybody get that one? Nope. Nope. Nope. Next. We've got the iPhone 15 pro at 27 Watts. Oh, I was close on that one. Did you guess 30? I guess 30. I guess 30. Yeah, I sure didn't. You know, what's horrible about this is that we keep going. The more it's guaranteed that I'm wrong. Oh yeah. Okay. Next we have the 16 inch MacBook pro M3 at 140 Watts. Hell yeah. You should have all gotten that one. I knew that was a thirsty bee. I knew it was thirsty, but I thought something else was thirstier. All right, next, uh, we have the Steam Deck OLED model at 45 watts. I got that one! That feels low to me. That does feel low. That means I know nothing. I put a little line in to prove it. All right, next item on the list is the Dewalt DCB094 USB Charging Kit. I got that one wrong. At 100 watts. Wow! Wow. Wow. I had it in the MacBook Pro, the 16 inch, I switched them. I gotta say, I got that one wrong and everything else waterfalled to wrongness after that. There was just a cascade of inaccurate answers after I got that one wrong. All right, well, we'll rip the band aid off gently here. It's the PS5 DualSense controller at 2 watts. That's good. Samsung Galaxy S23. At 45 watts, the one plus 11 5g at 80 watts. That's the only thing I know about one plus is that it'll just suck down power. That's what they do. I put a hundred because for the same reason I was like, one plus just get after it. Let's heat that battery up, it's fast. Put that shit on a hot plate. Let's go. All right. The 14 inch MacBook Pro M1 model at. 96 watts. Finally, we have the Pixel 8 Pro at 30 watts. Hey! Bang! I got two! I told you I'd take this home. All right, contestants, let's find out how you did. A reminder that each one that you got correct here counts for two points. A reminder that this is the winning worksheet. And if I had gotten this The DeWalt thing, correct? All right, Mr. Hotshot, tell us how many you got right. That's five. Got five correct guesses. Wow. David Pierce, how many correct guesses do you have on your worksheet? I got a whopping two right. Two correct from David Pierce. I have probably five other ones that are one Like, should I have put a hundred when I put 96? Yes, I should have. Should I have put 80 when I put 96? Yes, I should have. Tough beat for David. Come here. I'm sorry. Four points for me. All right. Alex Cranz. How many correct guesses do you have? Well, I can't make fun of David because it's the exact same. Two. I also got two right. But I got two right in the last round. Did you both try to do the highest and lowest first? Like, I knew that PS5 was the lowest and then I was just trying to figure out where the highest was and I knew it was the MacBook. I did highest first and then I started to scramble because I realized I'd done it all wrong but it was too late. So I was like, oh, PS, PS, I know that one's going to be low and that's, that's the one I got right. I very confidently, the first line I drew was iPhone 15 Pro to 30 watts because I was sure that was like. No question. That was correct. Three Watts off. And then, no, I will tell you what threw me while I'm being angry about this is that the Nintendo switch is famously the hardest gadget on earth to buy cables for. So I looked at this and I was like, what's the most random number on here? Because that's it. And I landed on 27 for the switch. And I was so sure that was right because I was like, no other cable, except the one dumb one that Nintendo will sell you will work. So it has to be a random one. And I was wrong. And I'm furious. I just randomly chose 96 and I was wrong. Do you think the Switch takes in 96 watts of power? I knew I was wrong at the time. The Switch has the processing horsepower of a phone from 2009. I was like, maybe it just gets thirsty. Well, I will just say, you guys are doing much better than you did last year on the Bluetooth Jeopardy game. So fair enough. , let's review the points from that round. Neli got 10 points for his five correct guesses? Yeah. Worst to first. David Pierce and Alex Cranz each got four points for their two correct guesses. Bringing our grand totals to Neli at 10. David? Yeah. Four. And Alex at 14. Yeah. Santa's back. I got you Terry for at least two rounds. Alright, now we go into round three. Round three is Mad Libs. We have given you a sentence with a bunch of terms missing, but all the terms are jumbled. The sentence comes from a recent Android Authority article spelling out just how complicated USB C has gotten. Fill in the gaps in the sentence with the provided terms. We'll give you three points each per correct placement. And the sentence is Blank is based on blank and aligned with the blank specification, thereby bundling in blank tunneling support for two blank or a single blank display output and blank capabilities on blank devices. Do we have four hours to complete this? And the terms we have for the sentence are DisplayPort 2. 0 4K PCI Express Hub, Thunderbolt 4, USB 4, Thunderbolt 3, and 8K. Oh my god. Alright everyone, please use your worksheet to fill out the sentence. I got it. Can I ask for definitions on several of these words? Also, is PCI Express a trick because no one has used that in 25 years? Are there more words than there are slots? No. Nailed it. By the way, that's how I took the LSAT, in case you're wondering. I finished the worksheet and just stood up and said, Nailed it! After every session. Okay. I'm having deep regrets already, but I'm, I'm locked in. I hit the buzzer. Cranz, you ready? Well, I guess I'm going to have to be. I've worked something somewhere. I knew the people who took the LSAT that way, too. All right, let's hear your sentences, contestants, starting with Alex Krams. That's rude. That's very rude. Ooh, Thunderbolt 4 is based on Thunderbolt 3 and aligned with the PCI Express specification, thereby Bundling in, mm, this is where it goes really bad, USB for tunneling, no that's just wrong, support for up to two hub or a single DisplayPort 2. 0 display output, mm, and 4K capabilities on 8K devices. It really went wrong there. You really just ran out of words there, that's how that feels. Just ran out of, I'm sorry, Terry, we've started strong. Okay, let's go with David Pierce next. Thunderbolt 4 is based on USB 4 and aligned with the Thunderbolt 3 specification, thereby bundling in PCI Express tunneling support for up to two 4K or a single 8K display output and hub capabilities on DisplayPort 2. 0 devices. Oh, that makes sense. I'm not sure that it does. You guys do not spend nearly enough time on the DisplayPort Wikipedia page. Sean Hollister is, is very upset somewhere right now. Uh, alright, Nilay Patel, tell us your sentence. USP4 is based on PCI Express and aligned with a Thunderbolt 4 specification, thereby bundling in Thunderbolt 3 tunneling support for up to two 4K displays or a single 8K display output and DisplayPort 2. 0 capabilities on hub devices. Alright, well, I believe Nila is going to be our winning contestant here, but let me read this sentence for you. It's actually, USB 4 is based on Thunderbolt 3 and aligned with the Thunderbolt 4 specification. That doesn't make any sense, thereby muddling in. Thereby bundling in DisplayPort 2. 0 tunneling support for up to 2 4K or 1 8K display output and PCI Express capabilities on hub devices. I just got two words and they are the same word. I got one right. Thunderbolt and PCI Express are the same, the same thing. Yeah. So why didn't you put them in the right places, Patel? Homonyms. The power of suggestion. No, I, I maintained the first clause of this sentence. It just objectively makes no sense and should not be allowed. I refuse. I'd just like to remind you this sentence came from an Android Authority article spelling out just how complicated USB C has gotten. I'd like to have a word with Android Authority. Could we bring them on the show? Yes. I'd like to question your authority, good sir. This is why there's no trust in American institutions anymore. All right, so let's review that round of Mad Libs to see how we did. Eli Patel got five correct guesses for a total of 15. Yeah. David Pierce got two correct guesses for a total of six points. Don't say it like that. And Alex Cranz only got one correct. For a total of three points. Let's go back to the big board to see our totals. We've got Nilay Patel at 25 now taking the lead. David Pierce at 10 and Alex Cranz at 17. And it would be more if it wasn't for the corrupt Android authority, whose administration I will bring down. I got to crush Neely in the last round. I think, I think for, for an extra 10 points, can Neely be forced to explain this in English? Yes. Now that I have the correct one. So the, the way that I always think about this just very quickly, and I know I'm going to gloss over the details, but the way I always think about this is that. Thunderbolt and PCI express are the same thing. And PCI is what's in your computer. And Thunderbolt is that exact same connectivity over a wire. That means Thunderbolt has lots of bandwidth. It's really fast. You can do expansion with it, which is how you get PCI expansion chassis over Thunderbolt. It's all makes sense. So. All this is saying is over time, USB four and Thunderbolt as USB gets faster and faster and faster, it starts to inherit the capabilities of Thunderbolt because Apple and Intel are all mixed up in the standard here. They're starting to align the things. So that you can do more Thunderbolt things on USB as it gets faster. So here USB 3 is inheriting a bunch of Thunderbolt 3 capabilities in alignment with Thunderbolt 4, which is itself getting faster. And that means USB 4 can now do Thunderbolt 3 things like display point. DisplayPort 2. 0 for two 4k or one 8k device and PCI expansion on hubs. I also appreciate that. Neal. I said it in more words than Android. All right, let's go to that final round, everyone, which is the showcase. Guess the price of the combined showcase without going over. The closest guess wins 20 points. Guess within 250, we'll give you an extra 5 points. Can we go back to Mad Libs? Guess within 100, get an extra 10 points. Guess within 50, and we'll give you a whopping 50 bonus points. Alright, Kabir, this is our moment. Let's go! Let's see what we have in this showcase. In this package, experience USB C in all of its many uses with this all inclusive podcasting kit. This cutting edge package would in theory include a 16 inch 2023 MacBook Pro with an M3 Pro chip, 12 core CPU, 18 core GPU, 16 core neural engine, of course, three Thunderbolt 4 ports, and 140 watt USB C power adapter. Along with that, we have the Sony W eight 1000 XM five wireless headphones, chargeable by USBC and then Roads NT one fifth Generation Studio Condenser microphone, which allows connection with both XLR and USBC anchors, 5 63 10, and one USBC docking station LGS 28 inch 16 by 18, dual up monitor with USBC. And to top it all off. A waterless, portable essential oil diffuser, rechargeable by USBC, by Lintro. All right, contestants, please guess the price of this deluxe podcasting kit. Prices came from the manufacturer's website, except for the case of the oil diffuser, which we found on Amazon. And we're going to start with our leader. On the scoreboard for right now, which is Neli Patel. Okay. 41. 79. 99. Alright, we've got Neli at 4,000 179 99. Next on the scoreboard we have Alex Cranz. What's your guess? 4,856. We don't know how much that microphone costs at all. , Alex Cranz don't, is going with $4,856. And David Pierce, what is your guess? There's only one right move, David. One dollar. I fucking knew it. I wrote down an actual number that I will tell you when I find out whether I won or not. And the actual retail price of this package is Damn it! Come here, we did it! Shit. Shit. 3, 847. Is that how that works? And 96 cents. And because this is Price is Right rules, if you've gone over, you lose. I'm so mad. Comeback of the century. Ah! Uh, no one knows how much that microphone costs. ? No, it was the monitor for me. How much was that? Micro monitor. Yeah. Can we get individual prices? Yes, please. Alright, let's break that down in more detail. The 16 inch 2023 MacBook Pro with M three chip was 2000. Nailed it. 409. Got that. The Sony headphones were $329. I was 20 off on that. It was a little high there. The road NT one condenser microphone was 249. Oh, it was high. Actually, it was only 50 bucks high. The Anker 563 docking station was 129. 99. I was high there too. That's a good deal. I'm way off on that one. Yeah. Yeah. 299. I'm gonna buy that for 125. Andrew, you put together a nice little package. Yeah. Very affordable. I put it at 50. VOD is very good. Yeah, the monitor is the wild card. The LG Dual Up monitor with USB C was 599. 99. That can't be a good monitor. I put 650. I was pretty close. Why is my LG monitor half that size and twice that price? Do you love pixel density? The thing you don't know about the Dual Up is that it only has 10 pixels. I would literally insta buy one of those if they could get better pixel density. Sorry, anyway. And finally, the Lintro 2023 Waterless Portable Essential Oil Diffuser from Amazon at 39. 99. Oh, nailed that one. Yeah, I know my Amazon garbage. Your company's called Lintro and you put the year in the product description? You're not going over 50. This is much more affordable than I thought. I podcasting setup to go by. I was hiding the headphones. The microphone and the docking station. And that allowed David to win, uh, which is a crime. So I was, I, I had that Mac book at three grand, not 2, 500. Um, and I blame Apple for not making any sense with what it tells you. And I was in aggregate, basically dead on with the rest of it. So I ended up, the number I wrote down was 4, 395, 61. And if you take away that 500 bucks, I was like, I was right there. So I'm, I'm feeling good about this, but also I won anyway. So learn how to play the game. David is fired. And what you've won is being alone for the holidays. That's correct. David got 20 points from this round. Our other two contestants with zero. That makes David our winner today with 30 points. Nilay just behind him at 25. And finally, Alex Cranz. Rigged by the corrupt Android authority. It's time. So sad. We're going to Hunger Games that shit. Congratulations to our winner, who David was playing for, Kabir. Let's tell Kabir what he's won. In our Verge swag gift bag, we've got a Vergecast t shirt from, uh, the popular What's a Photo series. We've got this awesome pair of Vergecast sweatpants, a Verge mug, a Verge hat, and of course, a Verge fanny pack. Thank you to everyone for playing, and thank you all for listening. Please get your pets paid and neutered to help control the pet population. Happy Holidays everyone, and make sure you charge your phone. Bring down the Android Authority.",

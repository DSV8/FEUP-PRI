    "transcript": "hey guys Eber here with Hardware Canucks and it's that time of the year again another big processes are launched from AMD now if you recall the last processor focus video that we did on the channel was around the second generation rise in two CPUs which are quite fascinating by the way because they use an enhanced Zen plus architecture and if you're interested in learning more about those CPUs you can check it out right over here but now it's time for these emphasis architecture to make its way into the high-end desktop platform meaning we're talking about the launch of Threadripper 2 now just to clear this out you could refer this as second generation Threadripper or Threadripper 2 doesn't really matter because the nomenclature does feature the second generation branding so you could refer to this the way you want it doesn't really matter at this point but what does this really mean for Skylake X or what kind of competition can we expect for Team Blue in fact what kind of performance benefits or differences that we're gonna see with this new processor launch from AMD we'll find that out but I also wanted to talk about a very special processor that aim DS launching that has the highest number of course that can be available for the desktop platform ever yet because it is really it's just amazing and how far we've come in terms of technology and what's what it's offering for its values so let's get into the juicy details but first a quick message from our sponsor the new t46 caliber ddr4 memory is one unique RGB kit with awesome light spill from each module and the special edition has a cool totem design on the light bar you get lifetime warranty up to 4,000 megahertz speeds and full lighting control through the software check out the t4 6 caliber ram down below alright so before I get too far into this video I just want to quickly clear up a few things around these new processor launch so first and foremost it is quite interesting because today is the unboxing embargo day which means that we are only allowed to share a few details regarding these processors but I'll try my best to not make this just an unboxing video but rather share as much information as I can regarding you know the specs on these new processors along with the you know pricing and availability as well now you could pre-order some of these CPUs today but I would highly recommend you wait for the performance analysis of these new processors and and take the plunge because they're not cheap so let's start off with a little bit of a history lesson if you remember the original Zen architecture launched Broadus risin processors and those were followed up by Threadripper for the high-end desktop market now we're seeing pretty much the same thing all over again Ryzen - and the twelve nanometer as n + architecture got into our hands in april and a threadripper 2 will be available starting this month while the second generation threadripper lineup will consist of four new processors the big boy this time around is the amazing 2990WX and with it aimed ease throwing a massive and I mean a massive rock at in Tulsa last this thing has a thirty-two physical cores and sixty four threads which happens to destroy what Intel offers with the 18 core 36 threaded i9 7980XE not only that but this CPU costs about $200 less and also operates at higher base clock speeds so yeah that's a direct slap in the face for Intel obviously the 2990WX is aiming for a market that Intel can't match but the 24 Core 48 threaded 2970WX may be the final nail in the 7980XE coffin it potentially offers more overall monetary performance but costs thirteen hundred US dollars well that certainly isn't cheap it's a great value for an ultra high in performance part aim D did provide a number of internal benchmarks and they certainly show promise for the 2990WX it absolutely destroys Intel's leading hdt offering in multi-turreted workloads but this chart also highlights something that AMD wants us to make very clear to you guys the W x-series chips is genuinely a poor value for gamers if that's something that you're looking into you should be maximizing your GPU investment while buying a risin or coffee-like CPU even if you're someone who does video or photo editing while streaming a game the lower price to threadripper processors I'll go over and a few seconds will be in much better fit the 2990WX and the 2970WX are tailor-made for high level virtualization pure content creation production studio levels of video processing or other areas where such a huge number of course be put to good use I think core affinity would be a great option here and just take that very honest advice from AMT into account before you put down a ton of money one thing that you will want to take into account is that these WX th CPUs have a huge TDP of 250 watts but they should still be able to overclock by a small amount speaking of those more affordable processors let me introduce you to the threadripper 2950X and the 2920X basically these will be replacing the 1950X and the 1920X it would CPUs that deliver higher clock speeds and the enhanced features we saw on rise in two processors like precision boost to higher memory speeds and xfr - basically the 2150X's boost clock is 400 megahertz higher and the 2920X's is 300 megahertz higher than their predecessors which could make a pretty big difference in games and other lightly threaded applications that's great news since India expects these to appeal to enthusiasts and gamers who need the ability to run parallel workloads what hasn't changed is the core counts from last generation since these parts have 16 and 12 course along with identical caching structures aim DS also be very aggressive on pricing as well while the 1950X in the 1920X were launched at $9.99 and 799 respectively these new CPUs shave off between a hundred and $150 from that I'm hoping this will force Intel to lower their skylake X prices by a bit but somehow I don't think that's gonna happen since that could make it look like they're giving in to AMD's pressure what you won't see here is a replacement for the 1900X and that won't likely happen according to AMD I suppose it makes sense since the 2700X already performs really well with its 8 cores and 16 threads while the x4 70 platform has plenty of features don't forget that the 2800X may still be waiting in the wings - aimed he simply didn't want to put too much of an overlap between their different lineups and the 2920X $150 price will really help bridge the gap between threadripper and the higher-end Ryzen on CPUs so overall aim D expects we'll see a four to eight percent improvement over the original threadripper results which is good for multi tiered workloads but these CPUs will still trail a bit behind Skylake X and gaming performance however that 6% shortfall is at 1080p and once a high resolution is used we've seen the playing field become pretty level click the link above to check out a video that we did with an older Sandy Bridge system using newer games it actually ended up giving almost the same gaming results as an 8700K with the GTX 1080 ti so trust me if you game at high resolutions a threadripper system will likely align perfectly with Skylake X okay so with that out of the way let's unbox this new processor so it's great to see that AMD upgraded their packaging along with their architecture but something you may have noticed was the form factor of B 2150 X it still uses the same TR for socket found on today's first generation threadripper and guess what that means yep that's right AMD won't be updating their x29 and platform and even the 2990WX and the 2970WX will be fully compatible with existing motherboards there won't be any new features added since AMD believes their current HTT motherboards have more than enough features for enthusiasts and I completely agree with that if you do have an existing x29 and motherboard the upgrade process is actually pretty simple all you have to do is download and install the latest bios that supports these new three different processors and you can just simply swap out the cpu with the new one and enjoy but what if you order a motherboard that's running in older BIOS or the process is actually fairly straightforward because every X39 a motherboard that's available on the market right now supports usb BIOS flashback feature so this essentially means that you wouldn't necessarily need a CPU in order for this thing to function so all you have to do is just download that BIOS with the USB plug it into the motherboard and you can start the flashback or the BIOS update process right away the last thing that I want to mention is how AMD will be staggering this launch because threadripper 2 products will be trickling out rather than being available all at the same time the first one out of the gate will be the threadripper 299WX which starts shipping on August the 13th and that's followed by the 2950X on August 30th then we'll have to wait all the way until October for the 2970WX and the 2920WX I have to wonder if these dates are being planned around Intel's rumored launch schedule or if it's just a matter of ensuring availability so that pretty much wraps up our introduction to threadripper 2 there's obviously a lot more content coming around in the next few days and weeks with these new processors personally I'm really excited with what AMD is doing lately not only have they successfully introduced an evolved version of threadripper in less than a year since the original launch but they're obviously winning the core count against Intel now one of the biggest benefits I see is their commitment towards the X399 platform because it still offers you know way more connectivity features compared to $2.99 and these processors are simply a drop-in upgrade and that's pretty awesome I guess the real question here is whether or not if until will respond and if they do what would that response be like let me tell you this the end of 2018 is certainly going to look promising or interesting for content creators and enthusiasts but what do you guys think do you have plans to purchase threadripper 2 or does Ryzen 2 or copulate still hold more value to you let us know in the comments down below obviously stay tuned for more coverage around these new tractor processors but until then you can check out some relevant content over here or you can subscribe to our new boot sequence channel for the latest tech news and rumors I'm Eber with Hardware Canucks thank you so much for watching and we'll see you in the next one",

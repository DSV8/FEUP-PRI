    "transcript": "- [Justine] Hey guys it's Justine! - [Austin] Hi I'm not Justine! - No, you're not, this is Austin and I'm so excited because today we're doing a fun little collab. So we're gonna be unboxing two different laptops so first we're gonna unbox mine and then we're gonna be heading over to your channel and unboxing another one - I see that this box is already open. - Okay I couldn't wait I had to just see what was inside of it, I just wanted to take a little peek but I didn't actually unbox the laptop itself - Okay - So this is the new ASUS VivoBook S14. Asus has this really interesting thing on their laptop keyboards, they have an antibacterial guard. And obviously I think we all know that keyboards are pretty disgusting after awhile - Gross. - especially if you're traveling and using them so consistently, so I'm excited to check that out. - I'll leave the testing to you and I'll just use the laptop, how about that? - Well I think we're basically gonna be testing out the laptop because I feel like to be able to actually test out the anti-bacterial we'd have to get a lab, and do all of this kind of stuff - I just trust that they did the research. - I'm excited for what's coming after our unboxing - Okay wait but lets not spoil it lets not spoil it - Okay - And my impending victory or anything - We're gonna be doing a little laptop challenge of doing a bunch of random tasks and we're gonna see who wins. Now we're gonna be using both of our different laptops that we've unboxed here so after this video make sure you go check out Austin to see who wins because we're not gonna tell you who wins in either of these videos - Yeah - You're gonna have to go and tally it up. - I've got a little question for you. - Yeah? - Um, why do you have two things in your box? - I don't know I didn't open it yet. - Well you kinda opened it. - Well I just opened to peek, I just wanted to make sure the laptop was in there is why (laughing) - That'd be funny if you just bought an empty box - You never know. I once got a phone delivered and there was nothing inside of it, so. Just wanted to be sure. - Hmm! - This is so exciting I'm on your set. - I know! - Like, this is so cool - You can even if you want, you can talk to the top camera - Whoa! - I'm always a big fan of that. - Yeah that's, that's great, like we've got a little - Yeah! - Top down action here - [Austin] Yeah! - I already opened this - Okay - But I did bring some knives. For the unboxing, do we wanna bring some knives out? - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah I see some knives here - Yep, here we go - So, here you go I'll let you take your pick - [Justine] Do you wanna pick which one you like? Go ahead, pick which one you want. Be great. - [Cameraman] The camera says rainbow. - Okay! All right! - The camera says rainbow?! (laughing) - Yes! The camera says rainbow! - We have a talking camera apparently, okay! - All right here we go. Okay, so I'm gonna need some assistance okay - I've got you, I'll help - Okay, ready? Okay. Wow look at this! - Wow the world! I feel wow'd! A laptop pouch? - My god it's a backpack! - Oh it's a whole backpack?! - No way! - Oh that's actually kinda neat, okay. - What a treat! Okay, I'm gonna open this first - [Austin] Wait does this actually come with it? Or did they just send it to you 'cuz they like you? - I mean I think this comes with it. - [Matt] Um.. We didn't get a backpack. - [Justine] But you got a monitor. - [Matt/Austin] We did get a monitor. We got a monitor. - [Austin] Yeah we have a monitor for our video, Yeah. - So, I'm not gonna lie I love laptop bags - Yeah! - So this is actually cool, look at this. Oh look at that - Oh that's a lot of space - You have one little space here we've got another space here. - [Austin] This is actually really nice to have included. - [Justine] I know! This is very nice. Okay, interesting. We'll set that aside. - [Austin] Can we wow the world yet? - I think we can wow it now. - Okay - Are you ready? - I am ready. I'm about to be wow'd though. Oh actually wait! I think I have a spoiler for this. ASUS do really cool boxes when it opens up it should present the laptop. Yeah it does! Look at that! - Whoa! Look at that! - Vivobook plus the environment go green save green that's actually a good slogan, I like that - That is pretty great look at this I like that its- - Is that OLED?! - It is! - Wow! - Whoo hoo! (laughing and cheering) - [Justine] Oooo! - [Austin] Oh what is this, like, this little like.. - This is such a nice size too - Wait, explore the possibilities, that's actually built into the laptop. - [Justine] Look at this, look at that zoom to really emphasize - So we've got 100% DCI-P3. 1000:1 contrast ratio for HDR, and low blue light with eye care flicker free low blue light I know its best to use blue light filters but, I think I spend too much time around color stuff that I don't- Anytime I turn that on, and the screen goes warm to save your eyes, I'm like \"that's not color accurate! That's not what the blue is supposed to look like!\" I can't do it. - I do the same things, so if I'm like editing, or something like that, like I definitely turn it off but, if I'm doing just like, email, like it is so much better on your eyes. - You're actually using it? - Oh I definitely switch it. It does make a huge difference - I want color accuracy 100% of the time in my life. - I only want it when I'm editing. Oooo look at this! Anti-bacterial guard ta-da! - Does it say it anywhere? Oh it's pantone valued oh that's actually pretty neat. - That is great. I like this red escape key, actually. And this little enter it's nice - Oh yeah it's got a lot of texture! So I'll say I feel like Asus makes obviously lots and lots of laptops, and they have a wide variety up and down the product range. I really like the aesthetic of this. I like the black sort of finish where its kind of got a little bit of sort of texture to it. You also have what seems to be a little bit of like you said a splash of color - [Justine] This is my favorite! - [Austin] Lay flat hinge? - Yes! - It's interesting like, this feels like it is a little bit more of a pro feature set on the laptop, right? Because obviously it's 14\", it's super thin, super light which you've got the OLED display, you've got the anti-bacterial finish, but you also have a bunch of stuff like the EVO certification with the core-i7 - Yeah and I also like that it has this finish but like, it's not impacting like, the keyboard at all Like, it just looks normal, it types normal and its just something that they have done in a variety of their laptops too and I didn't even know it - Yeah! - Which is so cool! - So that's how I think actually how this whole project kind of came up, because ASUS were talking about like, oh you know we do this anti-bacterial coating we want to make sure because obviously your laptop can get dirty and gross and it makes a lot of sense. And I had never even thought about it like I know like, for my phone I'll put it in one of those like little UV sanitizers all the time - Same! - Good luck trying to fit your laptop in there. - Yeah you can't do that - So it does have the webcam shield, so you can just cover it up which is nice, it's fully built in - I love that. - Definitely shout out to that. AI noise cancellation, two thunderbolt 4 you've got a USB-A on the side - Nice, nice. Yeah this is actually pretty cool because I'm so used to using a large laptop - Yeah. - And having something that is so small, portable and compact, and yet still powerful enough to be able to get everything done that you need - Yeah - Like maybe we will test out some gaming in our competition - Ooh. - I can't believe we already got a laptop and a backpack. - Actually that is really nice, I'm surprised I don't think I've ever seen a laptop come with a backpack before. - Here we are - [Austin] Oh there you go - [Justine] We've got a- oh it's USB-C, that's nice - 90 watt charger. - Mhm. - So what's nice about it is it does charge via USB-C so you've got those two lightning ports, obviously you can use the charger that comes in the box OR, most USB-C monitors or whatever will also be able to power your laptop, and help you to charge at the same time. I like how small this is, like its a nice sort of fit, but also it's not like so crazy thin where you can see they clearly got- not that we're gonna take this apart for the video or anything, haha, I would never do that. But you can see they clearly thought about the cooling you see actually one of the large fans right right in there. It also just feels nice. Just feel that in your hands - I know, it's great. - It feels like, solid, right? - It's pretty light too, considering. Oh lets take this off. - Oh good job ASUS. - It is time to start, the competition. - Is that why the dramatic music comes in? - Maybe, we'll see if I can find a good track or not (laughing) The first challenge on my channel is going to be a typing test. Now on yours we're going to be the A to Z typing test. - Yeah shamelessly steaming from arkez but it's really hard. - I'm excited to try it out. So right now we're just going to do this general typing test and see who gets a better score. - So we're just gonna go one shot fastest, but there's also accuracy, how are we going to play with accuracy? Just whatever? - We just wanna see like, well, we have our judge over here - [Austin] Yeah, Matt! - [Matt] Oho my time to shine! - So what do you think? - We're gonna average out word per minute with accuracy. - Okay that's fair I'm gonna be 100% accurate, it's fine. - I mean like, I can just declare Justine the winner for this. - I am going to make a lot of mistakes though - Oh yeah.. - How fast are you as a typer? - I don't know - A typist? - I don't know - A typing person? I'm okay I'm okay. - Should I take off my jewelry? Because now my arms feel heavy. - No you just have to like limber up - [Matt] It's like using weight so like, you want to practice with all the jewelry on, and then take it off when you do the actual precision. - We get one shot here - Yeah - There's no do-over there's no try over there's no do it again - [Matt] Do you guys want one practice round? - No. - [Matt] Good. - I've gotta take this off though - I've got the power of my Vivobook's amazing trackpad keyboard and ergonomic combonation. - [Matt] That is great but unfortunately a trackpad does not do a whole lot in a typing test. - That is also true. - [Austin] I'm just looking at how big my trackpad is and it makes me feel encouraged. - Well, are you ready? - I am. Okay, Matt. - Okay give us the countdown - All right we're gonna go, three, two- - Wait! Do we go on one? - Yeah, yeah good question! - (sigh) - [Justine] Three, two, one, go? Or Three two one! - I'll give you three, two, one, go. - [Austin] Perfect! - [Justine] Okay. - [Matt] Ready! Three, Two, One, Go! - Okay well I immediately messed up the first row. - [Justine] Oh I messed up! - [Matt] I see a lot of red, I don't think you're supposed to have red. - Aw, I'm choking right now. This is not good. I gotta get back in my rhythm. Oh this is li- (exhale) You're not already done are you? - Wait I'm done. Did we have the same amount of letters? And words? I'm confused. (laughing) wait yeah, we do have the same- how did I .. Because I'm not that fast. - You wrote 108 words per minute?! - And I messed up a bunch! - [Austin] A hundred and eight?! - [Justine] Like, I wasn't even trying! Like I'm not- No joke I was like typing slow because I didn't want to mess up too many times! I thought I was like slow, I didn't- I honestly like, when I looked over and half your words weren't typed (laughing) - Okay so here's the thing, I think I'm - okay. That was a horrible run by me. But my like, average In this test is like high 80's low 90s so even my best is not 108. - I'm actually surprised, I didn't know. - I'm curious as to how the accuracy works in this because I saw you get a lot wrong. - No, so you can get it wrong but if you backspace and fix it it doesn't count. But it obviously counts against your time, - Okay - You only lose accuracy if you hit enter and you move on or you hit space and you move on. - Well Justine had 98% accuracy. - I'm 97.. - And only had one word wrong. I mean you had - I got my first word wrong haha - [Matt] Ironically the word First. - Wow - [Matt] But I mean is there anything to judge here? - No I'll give you that one. - I wonder who won - I don't know, I'm shook. - I can't believe you're that fast. - I mean I didn't that that.. and I didn't even try which, I feel bad about. - Thanks. Rub it in much. - [Matt] Just casually just wrecking him. - Wow. - [Matt] Just ruined that mans whole career. - Who knows what's gonna happen over on your channel Maybe you'll win - I think we know. I think we know. - Maybe, we don't know. We don't know. - We do. - So this next challenge I'm pretty excited about we're gonna be using this really high end performance app called microsoft paint. - Look here's the thing right, we need to express our creativity using the best tools available. Sure, some might use photoshop - Illustrator - Or, 3D rendering, but you know what though I learned how to use MS paint - It was my childhood - Yeah I was about to say I think I was like 10 when I started to use MS paint. - Yeah - And uh, why mess with the best? - So what we're gonna do is we're gonna make thumbnails now how do we wanna do this? Do you wanna make a thumbnail for me, do you wanna make a thumbnail for yourself, for your video? - Should we just have Matt decide - I think Matt should decide - Who made the better thumbnail? - [Matt] Yeah! - And then the loser gets stuck with the worst one? When was the last time you used MS paint? - It's been a while. I mean, I sometimes use it whenever I do like, screenshots and stuff like that? - Do you really? - Yeah. Sometimes I'll just paste it in, save it, you know. - I don't think I've opened up MS paint since I was running like, vista? - Oh wow! - It's been a little bit, been a little bit! But you know what? Looking at it, it's here windows 11, and it looks beautiful and I think I've got every tool I could possibly imagine. I've got my paint bucket I've got my pencil and my eraser, and some colors. - And an eyedropper too. Important. - Eyedropper, pff, I can eyeball. - Magnifying glass, oh we're set. Okay - All right. So - [Matt] I'm gonna give you guys three minutes - [Austin] Okay - To do this. And at the end of three minutes you better have masterpieces - Okay! - It'll be a piece. - It's gonna be a piece of something. - Whoa whoa whoa, time out, I've got some like fancy looking paint you've got old paint. - [Justine] What are you doin'? What, are you cheating? - Did ASUS give you, ASUS, this is cheating you gave Justine the better version of paint. - Okay wait, look at your- click your about. - I don't have an about where's my about? - Yes you do down at the bottom, About! - Oh okay. I'm on paint 11.2 you're on paint 10.2 - [Justine] (dramatic gasp) I don't have the paint update oh no! - [Matt] I feel like we have to play it as it lies. - Guys this literally looks like what I use at the begi- wow you got like, look at this! This is actually kind of interesting. I have a relic here. I guess give us a countdown? Three minutes? - [Matt] Yeah, three minutes, three, two, one, go! - [Austin] Okay I'm already off to a good start. - [Justine] Hmmm. - So, I'm gonnq just, Up, okay, that's nope nope nope nope don't do that. Don't do that. Where am I missing something? So, I have a very specific idea in mind - [Justine] Okay - And my creative vision is gonna execute this to the fullest. - Like I actually went to school to be a graphic designer. So I don't know if that's like a good time to talk about it? - Ah, so here's the thing, I used to do a lot of pixel art in paint. - Oh! - Like I would mess with like sprites and what not oh look, I got multitouch trackpad for paint?! - [Justine] Whoa! - Okay, okay, all right, this is good. I like this. I'm feelin' good, I'm feelin' good, I'm feelin' great I'm feelin' snazzy and spectacular. - I am not doing well. - Okay I gotta cast my mind back. Windows XP, bliss background. - [Matt] Is that what you're doing?! - Yes the bliss background! - no one can tell! - [Justine] I'm just trying to make a pink square and it's not working. - [Matt] Well you have one minute to make it. - Oh my. - You're still working on your image?! - I was trying to pick my font! - [Austin] Everyone's gonna be so nostalgic for windows XP. I think I'm gonna win this one. I feel very confident. Oh oh oh I've got an idea! I've got an idea! I've got an idea! I don't have a time! - What? - Matt how much time do we have? - [Matt] Oh, ten seconds. (panicked yelling) - I'm making a big broccoli! I'm making a big broccoli! - A broccoli?! Wait my brush isn't working! - [Matt] Five, four - [Austin] Nooo! - [Matt] Three - [Austin] Noooo! - [Matt] Two! - [Austin] Noooooo! - [Matt] One! (Austin screaming) - No! I didn't finish my painting! - I don't know, I mean this took me three minutes. I'm not proud. At all. - Were these like shapes? You got a lightning bolt? I'm trying to build - You've got - I've got windows XP bliss! I was pretty close, right? - Yeah! I mean. - That's, that's.. - It's nice. - I didn't finish my tree though I was trying to- - [Matt] I'll be the judge of that. - Okay. All right. - I don't want you to see our artwork - Mm. - Oh yeah. - Hmm. - Look, I don't, you didn't give me a ten second warning. I wasn't ready. If you would have said 10 seconds I would have stopped. I was in the middle and you said \"oh by the way, you're done\" I'm just saying that seems unfair. - So what I like about Justine's is it has thunderbolt showing off the features that this guy has. - Yeah - [Austin] Oh no. - Um - [Cameraman] Here's a comparison. - Yeah, what, is a the tree that you're putting in? - [Austin] I was trying to spice it up! - [Cameraman] It's the tree because it's the environment - You should have done the windows 11 bloom - Oh. - Yeah it's I like that this includes the features of the laptop, yours didn't. - And I just wanted to show that I loved it so much - But you didn't complete your thought. - Yours does look like a valentines that you're in like kindergarten - [Austin] Haha, will you be my valentine? - [Cameraman] But like the one that you give like you had to give out, to like everyone - Yeah - [Cameraman] Not like your favorite friend or the kid you liked, you're like okay, here you go. - I gotta dock Austin points for adding to a masterpiece. You don't get the Mona Lisa and then give her, I don't know - [Austin] A mustache? - A mus, yeah. - Or a hat? - Or a hat. - Well but, I just, I don't know. I mean. - I got, I mean there's not a lot to go on here. I gotta go with cleaner heart, cleaner lightning bolt, and cleaner thought bubbles, those clouds.. - [Austin] You know that those are shapes that are preset buttons, right? I freehanded this. - There's nothing about being a better freehander than making a better image. - I'm an artiste. - [Matt] Apparently not! I'm a creative - I'm a innovator, entrepreneur - And also now a loser. Oh! - [Cameraman] Wow! - [Matt] For the record its not a now a loser thing it's just.. - I didn't mean it I'm sorry! Maybe you'll do better on your channel. - Thanks I appreciate it. - Is this my channel? This this my channel - Yeah. - You can maybe redeem yourself - Thanks I appreciate this as well - Loser ha! - I feel attacked, and judged, and I don't like it. - So right now we're going to be doing a TSA challenge I have done this maneuver many times in the airport where I'm either trying to make a thumbnail I'm trying to do something on my computer and I'm like scootin' around, you know like, in the airport and I thought this would be very fitting because the airport is kind of dirty and grimy - Yeah? - This has the antibacterial guard so I know that we're safe and we're protected. - The antibacterial guards help when I inevitiably drop my laptop on the ground because I'm trying to push this suitcase too hard? - Lets hope that doesn't happen, so, - Hope! It's gonna happen. - What we're gonna do is we're gonna be cruisin' around these markers here that is for the table that has been removed, and what are we gonna make a presentation about? - [Matt] Uh, I'll figure it out as we go along. - Okay. - Okay cool - [Matt] I don't want to give you too much of a hint. - All right. - All right I'm ready. So we just gotta do circles? - So.. yes. I think circles would be good - Okay I'm ready - And then what, a three minute challenge here? - [Matt] Something like that. - So I think a big part of this is going to be making sure the laptop stays level. - Yes - Because you know, TSA, you gotta be moving. Someone behind you is yelling at you - Yes so if I come up behind you - He's missing all his- - Beep beep beep beep! - You're about to miss your flight okay okay, we're- I'm good to go - [Matt] All right - [Justine] All right oh I'm getting ready. - [Matt] So I need a power point before you guys go on vacation. - [Austin] Okay! - [Matt] Uh, I know you're all excited, I need a power point on why I am the greatest and should not have been kicked off my show. - [Justine] Okay - [Austin] Okay I can do that. - [Justine] All right - [Austin] I'm downloading my template! - [Justine] Oh boy. - Geometric color block lets go! (music playing) - [Austin] Sh- - [Justine] Oh! - Should help whenever I inevitably drop my laptop on the ground because I'm trying to push this suitcase too hard - [Justine] Lets hope that doesn't happen, so.. - [Austin] Hope! It's gonna happen. - Its fine! My 360 hinge shows how durable everything is! It's fine we gotta keep moving! - [Justine] Oh my God! - How many slides do we need? - [Matt] Uh I feel like I need some charts, maybe a graph - No you don't! - Of, you know - Okay fine. - something I can show to the investors about why I'm better than Austin Evans. - [Justine] Well, I can't.. - This is hard. - [Matt] It is really hard. - These suitcases have big handles on them! - [Justine] They do. - I'm sweating right now, it's, I mean. - [Justine] Smart, smart! - This is very challenging for Matt. You know I'm a big fan of star wipes. - [Austin] No I'm not making a transition! Core performance - I like to have a little pizazz in my presentations. (music intensifies) - Don't mind me, this is just the way I walk through the airport. - And you know what, I like to end my powerpoints with- - I'm not done yet! I've got a lot more inputs! - Some pizazz. So I want you to find the cutest animal you can find and put it in the powerpoint on the last slide. - [Justine] Oh you're tossing me up! - I've gotta keep moving aaah! - My gosh. - [Matt] You look out of breath there. - Yeah! I'm walking fast because my webpage won't load for some reason. - Do you think walking faster will load the webpage? - It will! I'm never going to be done with this this is a really hard challenge! - This is hard, okay I think we quit. - [Austin] Okay lets just turn in what we've got. - Okay I'm just gonna delete all of the ones that I did not use. - I'm not gonna send.. - Now when you email them to me I will have an out of office until Monday. - Why Matt deserves glory, a presentation and dissertation by Austin Evans. Don't mind the extra N I couldn't get rid of that. Primary goals! Matt is better than Austin. It's a known fact - It's a fact, not a goal - I need to say that because I need to get points. Look at the quarterly report, pre-Matt, the numbers were very bad and getting worse. Post Matt they got better every quarter. - Wow. - We went from 0.3 to 88 with Matt. - And I maintained apparently 0 column one growth. - Column one growth I couldn't delete. - We want that to be zero. - There's no pre or post Matt there's just Matt. So that's my dissertation. - Got it. - I didn't get it I just made three. - Huh so where's the animal? - Uh. It's on bing, I couldn't get on bing. - So, you.. okay. - Matt is the best. - Yep. - By Justine. - Yep - Wow that seems very biased. - Yes - This feels very much like there's a certain- - Is there a pinata? - I promise there's transitions, okay? - Okay. - Why Mattis the best. He's kind, funny, handsome, cool, and likes things. - Uh, four of those things are correct. - Why Matt is better than Austin. Matt is just a better person. - That's true. - Its fine - I don't believe it. - Matt is art. - I've seen that at moma - Yeah. Cute animal. - I never had a shot, did I? Never had a shot. - Uh like I asked for something, I expect to get it and you just didn't deliver. - But look at your quarterly performance! Where's your graph on why Matt's performance is quarterly excellent - You did ask for.. - I did, but I mean - Look how big my graphs are. - Scroll down? - Hold on a second let me show you this. Oh! - Oh! - Look at that transition! - Wait. Wait, - She does have a transition. - But, and then she has star wipe to that animal. - There definitely was one, there was a star wipe somewhere - But not to the animal - It wasn't the animal. That was a star wipe. Yeah but at least there's an animal. I guess this is the last challenge, so who do you think won this challenge? - I think you're gonna have to check out our video over on thisis and determine for yourself because we went head to head with all these competitions. - But who won this one. - Oh yeah! No, you. - Okay yeah all right. - Yeah yeah that's what I thought. - Yeah well this was actually really really fun thank you guys so much for watching and make sure you go check out their channel because the other half of the video, to see who wins will be there and you'll be able to tally it up yourself because we're not gonna spoil it. - You also could go to the link in the description and buy the Vivobook 16x, the superior laptop - S14 for the win. - Yeah actually, I wish, mine was a little too big for this challenge I'm not gonna lie a smaller laptop would have been better. - My fingers are smashed, like, because I was holding it like this and trying to like, cruise around. - When they said they had an ergonomic keyboard design I don't think they had this particular challenge in mind. This one was a little outside the- - What if you find ergonomic though? - I did a pretty good job, I mean I still managed to type. - I think it's best when it's on a stationary surface, not your hand. - Definitely. - It does look very clean though. - It does look clean. - Yeah, no bacteria here. - I'll lick it one more time. - Don't lick the- - Ohh! Well, the antibacterial guard so he's fine. You're fine. - Totally fine. I'll survive. - Thank you guys for watching make sure you go check out the video on their channel and like, comment, subscribe and hit the bell to be notified when we post new videos! See ya later.",

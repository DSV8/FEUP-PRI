    "transcript": "- That's right, folks. We're back with another ShortCircuit. And this time, we're checking out a desk. And you've got me, and Dennis hosting this video. So, it's a two for one deal. Today we're taking a look at Secret Lab's Magnus Pro XL. Which is a sit, stand desk. - Pro. - I'll go here, you use the screwdriver to cut it, okay? - [David] Where'd you get that screwdriver, Dennis? - LTTstore.com - [David] Nice, that's great. - It's a sit stand desk, and it's actually got a lot of cool features that we're gonna go over. Cable management, RGB, all sorts of stuff. - Wow, look at that. - That presentation though. What's it say? I wish more companies did this. Whoa. - This is a big package. - Where do I? That is a big package indeed. - This is so big. So I'm kind of like useless now because my hand hurts, my leg hurt, everything hurts. - Useless now? - Channel Super Fun. I just fought Linus yesterday. - [Announcer] Wow, Dennis is doing quite an aggressive play. - My thumb got twisted, and my leg, my feet hurt a lot. So, I'll move a little bit slower, but that should still be better than Colton. - The built in cable management thing's probably the biggest feature for me because a lot of sit stand desks just have a tray. - Yeah. - Or you're just expected to just lay your wires there. - Even the desk that we've got for the set here is just, nobody took time to organize that. It's got a small tray underneath it. This is the-- - I really wanna take a look at it once we set it up. - Cool. Ah! Wow, you didn't even react. - Actually, no fingerprints. Look, David. (palm banging) I love it already. Even if you lick it, I don't think-- - Stop. Don't lick the table. - Should I? Should I? - [David] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - [Colton] That's pretty good though. Stop. - Not too bad. - Did you just kiss it? - Colton, this one is the tool kit, and mounting block and cable tray. - Oh, tool kit. - Beautiful - This is very similar to the chairs. Which is nice. - Oh! Ah-ha! - [Colton] You have the instructions? - Instructions. - [Colton] They were right in the box the whole time - Assembly, yeah assembly. It's behind this thing. - World's first sit to stand metal desk with fully integrated power supply column. Structure optimized for loads up to 265 pounds. - That's your-- - Is that how much you weigh? - Yeah same joke! You're so... (laughing) - We both made the same joke. - You're not fit I'm not fit either. - I understand. What do you mean I'm not fit? I work out. I've worked out. - Do the legs first. Do the legs. - Where are the legs? - The legs - [Colton] Nicely laid out - The legs. Legs. Legs. - [Colton] Fantastic. This is a desk mat. One of the main selling features of this desk is that you can buy different desk mats from SecretLab and slot them into the desk which is cool. - That is what I am just gonna say. This feels so, like, sturdy. Hard. - Yep This is really heavy. Oh my god. - I told you! That is really heavy. - [David] Did that knock you over? Full extension guys. Full extension - Full extension - Come on David. We don't go to gym like you okay? That's it for me. (Dennis grunting) Oh yeah you've been working out this whole week too! That sucks. (Dennis coughing) Why are you coughing? - Why I am coughing. - And now a word from our sponsor. Dbrand. [Both] playfully yelling and laughing Dbrand, they sell skins. They sell grips. - They sell so many things. - They sell plenty of crap and why do they make us do this? - Wait, my shoes! Ah! My shoes! Oh my god why do we have to do this? Ah! Wait, wait, wait. - Okay, that's enough. - Okay. Deep breath. I don't have any good to say to you. Dbrand.com/ linus Get some stickers. - Ooh! That feels so nice. - I am not connected first. - [Camera Person] Get that under the desk first. - There you go. I also like this sliding feature it can just slide it in and just screw in instead of like lining up, you just save more time I think. Quality! I feel the quality actually. Next step, assembling the mounting blocks. - There is actually no wrong way you can install this, they designed it in such a way that you just slot it in everything lines up and you're good to go. Next step is assembling the cable tray, we need 8 pan head screws. Which are clearly labeled right here. - So far it's pretty easy to do. Everything is pretty clear. I like it. - Next step is assembling the table feet. Again, I don't think there is a wrong way that you can install this, which is really nice. Just one way to do it. Watch Dennis mess it up. - What? Which screw? - Wait, what? Yeah wrong screw. - I need that other screw. Okay legs are done and they tray is installed. You can feel it now it's very sturdy. - Dude! - This is heavy. - This thing is heavy The wall, the wall! - Ow my leg! - [Colton] What? - I really like the, all the buttons that integrated in here instead of like. - You know you're gaming, you're trying to move it and you're like ah! Crap! It's in the way. - That's! And this so clean. - The more I see of this desk though, the more extensive it gets in my head. - Yeah. Where is the...? - It's at a really convenient spot. You're going to be impressed. - Convenient spot? - [Colton] Look down. - Look down. Down. This is down. - [Colton] I think you are on the right side. Look down - Look down? I have to look up! - [Colton] Don't look up right now, what are you doing? - Look down where? - [Colton] Look down (laughing) - Oh here! Oh my god right here. - [Colton] Yep, this is the integrated power supply column that we were talking about. - Oh beautiful! - This is the reason that you buy this desk. Okay. Do not release the button until a beep is heard. RST. Okay. Oh no! What did I do? Do not read. Do not release the button. Stocks go up baby! - Are you over 120 kilograms? - I have no idea how much I weigh - 265 pounds I am 5'6. - Oh wow Dennis, someone's taller than you. What you doing Dennis? - I am trying to see if a tall person will that work - Trying? Of course it will work. What do you mean? How tall is that apple box? - [David] Uh, according to your math like 4 feet tall. - Oh dang, shots fired. - Okay that is way too tall. - What? Oh hey, no no no! - Some other desk or adjustable desk, when you stop it will do a little shake. Let's see if this does that. No, it doesn't. - Very smooth and it's quiet too. It's not too loud. - I am 150 pounds. Wahoo elevator. - We missed a piece. This is the hinged rear cover that covers cable management tray and I believe when we add the RGB it sits between this as well. This is stupid! It's hinged buddy. It goes back like this. - Oh! - We didn't do it wrong at all. - Oh, okay! - We were trying to screw it in from wrong side. - So this thing opens. You don't even need the cable management, just go in. It's covered. - Well exactly. - You don't see anything. - If you want to mount a monitor to your desk, you just need to open this hinge compartment, put it here and as long as your mount isn't too chunky you can have it come out to here. - How big is this gap? - Probably an inch. Oh yeah, we're good. Ow! This isn't such a... - Beautiful! - [Camera Person] Wouldn't it be easier with a second pair of hands right now? - [Colton] It would; but it's really funny watching him struggle. - [Camera Person] You're right. You're right. - [Colton] Line it up better Dennis. - Okay. Fine. Fine. - [Colton] You are making it harder the more you unroll it. - I think I am going to roll it back. Gordon kind of ruined it. I am gonna roll it back up. - [Colton] Dennis, what are you trying to do? Let's just.. - Put this, okay put this, put this in. - No. - [Dennis] What, why not? - I don't want to. - Slide it in. Slide it in. - Is it wrong or what? - [Camera Person] Is the seamed part gonna fit in? - You, you make sure you line it up before you roll it otherwise it's magnets you know it will be hard to adjust. - One sec. - Beautiful. This is on the SecretLab website, they have a couple different designs for you so this one is Secret Mag Pad extra large. That is this one. All different kinds. I like this. I just like the simple one. - [Colton] I pick cyber punk. Go to the cyber punk one. - [David] No I don't like it. - [Dennis] I like black. - [Host] All right. - [Dennis] Simple. - [Host] Looks unfinished - SecretLab makes RGB trademark extra large diffused LED strip. - I am excited for it. - Beautiful. - Magnetic headphone hanger. Magnetic cable management bundle. - Is everything magnetic? - SecretLab magnet single monitor arm. There we go! We can find out how to mount a monitor. The one that I am most interest in because my PC is sitting on the floor, is SecretLab premium PC mount. - [Dennis] PC Mount? Wow. Hey! What? Only 8, less than One Thousand dollars? - We all thought this was more than it actually is. So the base SecretLab Magnus Pro XL that we are looking at right now, is $949 US. - [Camera Person] That's without the pad though. That's without the pad. - [Colton] Yep - It's all magnetic so it's very simple. Look this is one piece. What you do, is you just do this. - [David] What? - No installation! Beautiful! Oh, wait. Why is it not? Okay there. You can put your shoes. Hang in there! - Okay but then you're gaming, right? And you're like oh, well, cool. Sweet. - What? What? Who does that? Oh sweet. This one is magnetic cable management, any shape you want to make it like that you can make it like that. Doesn't matter. I'm not faking it. This is SecretLab premium PC Mount. Very simple. Lock, unlock. Then adjust this. They make everything so easy actually. - [Colton] Fun - And then you lock it. - How did you extend this? - [Camera Person] So you pull it out. - You twist it and pull. - Okay - And then lock. - I know it's really difficult for us to not be hyped about this, and I swear this is not sponsored. This, I have the bracket mounted on the underside of the table. We just slide it in. Like that! And then we put the PC in. - [Camera Person] Where was this desk during my intel upgrade? - Right? - I Know! But would I chose this over my neon sign? Tough decision. Okay fine! - Pretty dope. I have a little, it should be loaded a little forward more. - [David] Don't lower it down because Colton's under there. - Yo this is sick! - [Colton] This is actually dope. - Beautiful. Magic. So this is the cable management for the side You can put it by your PC. So you can put it here. You can put your cables here or in the back. Doesn't matter. You can move it around. I see, I said it's a magnet. Magnetic. Which is the best part of magnetic. Beautiful! - Awesome. And that's it. So this is $89 USD From SecretLab. Honestly, worth it. In my opinion if it means that I don't have to clean my computer as much because I don't have it on the floor where it's going to get dusty as often. This is a hefty RGB strip. Ow! - Sorry! - That actually hurt. - Oh, it's magnet too! - Of course it is. - You know what? All this RGB strip always fall off. But to be honest, because of the magnet you can put it anywhere you like. - Yep. - So beautiful! - Well hold on. I guess if it was dark. - [David] Yeah there is a lot of Light - Okay that is a lot of light there. But like you can see, very subtle. If they have magnet on this thing, instead of those tape 3M tape will be really nice. - The only thing I will say about this say about this experience is I wish they used more eco-friendly packaging. A lot of this the plastic and the styrofoam. Is this recyclable? - [Davidr] I don't think so - I don't think so right. So. There's lots of that. - Look at the design. Do you like it Colton? - [Colton] I like it. - [David] Take those peels off. - [Colton] I like it. - [Colton] Peel it. Come on Dennis. - I don't like peeling. That sound. The color. It's just so good. - $89 US for this. - And look at this. See, take a look. - [David] That's how it works dude. - That's it. You get, so you can adjust the tension here by using a screwdriver. And then you can tighten or loose. - I don't want to lie, I was coming into this video expecting not to be impressed by this desk; but I am quite impressed and I feel like I need this. - I need this. - This is an end game desk. - I need this too. - I am gonna take this one. Dennis do you have any closing thoughts? - Oh, ah ****! (laughing) - Just cut it there! Cut it there. Thank you very much for watching everybody. - Thank you guys for watching. Make sure you subscribe. I am going home. - [David] Not with my desk. - This is my desk, with me. - [David] I don't think so. I will fight you for it.",

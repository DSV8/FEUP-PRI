    "description": "X-Star Premium Drone (USA Link) -  X-Star Premium Drone (International) -   Autel Robotics YouTube channel -   Had the chance to take a look at the Autel Robotics X-Star Premium Drone. This thing retails for under $1000 and features 4K video, stabilized video (via gimbal), 1.2 mile range and a 64GB SD card to capture it all. It's an all-in-one package, super easy to use.  From the manufacturer -  The X-Star Premium has twice the HD Live View range compared to the X-Star, includes a larger 64-GB card, and comes packed in a semi-hard, splash-proof, zippered premium case.  The X-Star Premium is a sophisticated yet amazingly easy-to-fly quadcopter designed for superb aerial imagery. The 4K camera and 3-axis gimbal can record crystal-clear, smooth Ultra HD videos or take 12-MP photos with HD Live View up to 1.2 miles away. This drone is ready to fly out of the box, and can be flown with or without the help of the free Starlink mobile app. Powered by an intelligent flight control system, dual GPS and GLONASS satellite navigation and aided by the Starpoint Positioning System, the drone stays safe and stable, even indoors or at low altitudes. Where other drones might become erratic or fly away when there is magnetic interference, the X-Star is equipped with our exclusive SecureFly technology to help your drone come back home safely.  Learning to fly the X-Star is easy: you can start the motors, take off and land, hover, or have the drone automatically return home by using the one-touch buttons on the remote controller. The controllers integrated LCD displays critical flight information, allowing the Starlink mobile app to show fullscreen live HD video. Starlink brings a wealth of autopilot features such as follow, orbit, waypoints, and also lets you adjust camera settings and record images in flight. With the X-Star Premium from Autel Robotics, a new perspective is just one flight away.

    "transcript": "So I told you guys I was going to do more stuff about drones. Drones are cool you know that we've got a fresh drone video for you the folks over at Autel they saw my last one and they were like listen we're about to bring our a-game to unbox therapy and I said let's do it it's called x-star premium for a not-so premium price a very affordable price in fact i first saw that picture I was like okay kinda interesting little bit flashy you got yourself an orange drone but then I realized what it's all about the sky and clouds are white why would you drone be white you want to see where it is when it's floating around up there now this unit also has a gimbal and camera pre-installed capable 4k X-MORE sensor it's also got some pretty impressive flight time up to 25 minutes 34 miles per hour top speed and you can send it off 1.24 miles that's pretty impressive video resolution 4k up to 30 frames per second if you need more frames you can do so in 2.7 k okay oh yeah also on the front seven-day-a-week customer support oh wow you can see that the gimbal is installed right now but it's actually removable as well here are your propellers silica gel for Jack little lanyard to show your love couple of antennas at the top here this is where your device goes at the top could be an iphone could be an android device and that's going to give you your visual on top of that there's also an LCD display in that location there that's going to give you altitudes range battery the battery on the unit comes out like this i'm guessing what happens here look at that all that's smart that's the right way to do it okay so this goes into the battery to charge it up and then your other connector over here goes into your controller so one power brick for both units i like that a record button and then a snapshot button for still image you can appreciate the 4k camera how tiny that thing is in there and it's also got a microSD card by default pre-installed comes in the box but of course its drone and the fun part is flying it so let's go do that it's a simple as powering up this remote powering on the aircraft then connecting the device it'll show connected up here it shows the battery life of the aircraft you also see some conditions listed over here the wind temperature and precipitation it's got a gamble on it so that's sort of this motorized contraption that keeps the camera incredibly stable sending it up in the air is easy first you start the motors with this button and move over to take off at which point it will just kind of cover there and then you're onto the thumbsticks you are steamin through the air here are the photo settings as well as video settings 4k 24 frames is what we shot it will also do 4k in 30 frames you can select the ISO shutter speed and then exposure compensation as well the thing is a pleasure to fly to be honest with you it's all super straightforward I mean it's really foolproof to be quite honest if you haven't tried to drown before you'll see what I'm talking about it and give this one a shot give it a trial run you're gonna be addicted just like I am TR147LO.CH091516",

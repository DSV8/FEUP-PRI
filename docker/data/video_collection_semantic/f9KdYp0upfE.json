    "transcript": "- Your PS5 is an old obsolete piece of garbage because in a mere 18 months, the PS5 Pro will be out. Get yourself a PS5 Pro because it is coming according to the telephone communication - Limited? - Limited Company. - Okay. So Twitter is absolutely loosing it's God(beep) mind right now over the leak of the PS5 Pro and the Xbox Series XXX. - We have new generations of consoles coming, supposedly in the year 2023/4, but here's the thing. - I gotta drink some pure leaf tea to wash down the salt in my mouth right now. Pause for a second. (swallowing drink) Ah, okay. - It's not happening. It's not, it's not happening. - TCL is a well respected TV manufacturer. They had a presentation from this morning, at least as of recording this video, you're probably watching it yesterday where they break down how game consoles have helped kind of drive innovation in TV space forward. They claim, - Bold claims. - 4k 60-120 for the render resolution 8K 60-120 for the output resolution and we get an extra little nugget here. We are going to be using a RX7700XT GPU a new generation, something that does not exist yet. Is this trending right now? That everyone is convinced it is absolutely wrong. Now I will not tell you, sit here and tell you that in 2023 or probably more likely 2024 that we may not get a new PS5 or a new Xbox, that's totally possible. - No, we, I feel we will- - But not based on this. - Let's unpack the first thing. PS, the PS5 Pro. We're not getting a Pro model in the next year and we're not getting a Pro model even in two years. We still can't even manufacture enough of the regular models to keep them in stock. Let alone adding onto that again. Someone's gonna say, well they're just gonna make a new more powerful one that they can keep in stock. That's not how that works. - No, not yet. - I think in the next 18 months or so we will see another PlayStation 5 which will be more like a PS5 slim. - Absolutely. - The newest PS5 we're gonna get is gonna be a more optimized version of the current PS5. - A slim model like we've always seen. - It's gonna be roughly the same power, roughly the same specs in it. Just cheaper to manufacture. - Yep. - Less power hungry. We're not gonna see a beefier version of that anytime soon. - No. And so here's the thing, we could theoretically see another generation especially in a year to two years AMD will have new GPU technology that they can take advantage of. The difference here is that while last generation the consoles were getting old, it was four years into life cycle. Both Sony and Microsoft really felt the need to push another half generation update. Now it is possible that the PS5 and the Xbox will see a mid generation bump, but what I think is a lot more likely is we're gonna see a slim console. Maybe we see a bump to the series S now that is something two years from now I could believe. I could believe we're gonna see a series S that is closer to the series X in terms of performance at around that same kind of price. That would make sense to me. But in the world we live in which chip shortages are making things more expensive not less expensive. Even the idea of a slim console is not a guaranteed lock. Right? - The other thing to unpack on this is I don't think TCL is wrong. The other specs that TCL has on here it's gonna be, you know, 8K 60-120, whatever. I don't think these specs are wrong for a PS5 Pro. I just think the date that they say that these are coming out are wildly wrong. Anyone who's ever looked at tech can just surmise these because these are just the next logical step in anything that we're doing. - Not even look, they say that the Xbox one and PS4 was 720p and output at 1080p, not really most games were 1080p on the PS4 at least. Same thing. The series X and the PS4 Pro was 1080p and 4k output. No, a lot of games were actually 4k. Look they're trying to set it up of like, Hey game consoles are getting more and more powerful. They're pushing higher resolutions, higher frame rates. Which is true. But they're also trying to position that in a way of like, Hey, our TVs can handle the 8K or whatever. Guess what? The Xbox series X and PS5 can't handle 8K right now. Are we seeing any games that run in 8K? No, because that's stupid. And I don't think even with the Pro, we're gonna see 8K target. I think it's possible, but it won't, no one's gonna do it. Why would you do it? - Right. They're gonna make one game, which is exactly what like Xbox did with Ori. With like, oh yeah, this can run 6K blah, blah. Just to say, we can do this. TCL's like, oh yeah, we have these specs that are definitely correct. I don't think they're incorrect. I just think we're way farther down the line than what they're saying here. - 'Cause all they care about are selling TVs, right? This whole presentation. It's a slide that if everyone has absolutely jumped on because again, this is not like JoeMcPS5face on YouTube. Who's out here making some random rumor. I mean this is a very large TV company, - Which is why we decided to make this video. Just to say like, this is not, it's not real. Anyone who's ever looked at tech knows that these are the next logical steps that anyone could've just picked out of a hat. What do we think the next buzzword in gaming's gonna be it's gonna be 8k, it's gonna be, you know, 120 FPS the AMG GPU that they're using. Oh, look, they added a one. - What? You went from the 6700 XT to the 7700 XT. - How did they come up with this? - My thought on this whole thing is that this is absolute nonsense. Like let's just forget that TCL even did the stupid slide and everyone got excited, right? 'Cause we could just ignore this. This is not based on any real facts whatsoever. This is purely speculation. Now when we talk about what we expect in these next generation of consoles, my thought based on what we're seeing with the chip shortages and whatnot is that we're gonna probably see everything at least a year longer on the timeline compared to where we would've seen for last generation almost entirely because first of all these consoles don't have huge glaring weaknesses. The Xbox One or the PS4 both were a little weak for their time, CPUs were terrible. Hard drives were slow. Like there was clear incentive for them to make a half generation update because those consoles couldn't handle 4k and all these things that were very, very popular. Fast forward to today there's not the motivation from the chip manufacturers as well as from AMD and from Sony, Microsoft to create a more powerful version of these things because let's face it. You can't even get your hands on a PS5 and an Xbox right now. So there's no point in them spending all this time trying to make a pro version yet because they're selling every single one that they can. On top of that. Yes. If 8K was prevalent and everyone had switched to 8K then there would be a lot more incentive for I think the manufacturers of these consoles to push 8K as like a real selling point. Guess what? Yeah. You can go buy an 8K TV, almost no one is buying them, almost no one cares because unless you're watching avatar four it doesn't make a difference. And you can hardly even see 8K, right? - No. - So it's like so many things here are wrong. I think the best case scenario is we get a slim model of the PS5 and maybe a series X in a couple of years. But honestly, I wouldn't even be surprised if there's no real performance updates to either console until we get 2025 or 2026. None of this makes sense and I'm really upset about it and the fact that I had to come all the way over here, I have a sandwich waiting for me that I was about to eat and Matt goes \"Hey, did you see a stupid PS5 thing?\" Everyone telling us we need to make a video on it and then they started tweeting us about it and I got really upset. - I have a philosophical question for you. So you say like everything's gonna be like moved back a year because of chip shortage which I agree with. How much of a ripple do you think this is gonna have in the overall long term lifespan of these consoles? - Longer, like absolutely longer. These don't have the main like sort of downside, again there's nothing wrong with the PS five or series X. It has a great CPU, very capable GPU, plenty of memory. Fast SSD, like last generation there were just huge gaping holes and that they were not ambitious consoles and it made it really easy for them to bolt on a big GPU and instantly rectify a lot of the things and help the marketing of the, of the one X. - So last generation was about seven years. - Yeah. 2013-2020. - Yeah. So we kind of just saying like oh you know we're expecting something similar from this generation. This is before chip shortages. Do we think now that the lifespan of this generation is more like 8, 9, 10 years - It could be - because of like how this is rippling through the industry? Because when they do finally start making a pro if we're still having chip shortages, which is a very real possibility right now. A lot of projections have said this is gonna go into 2023, 2024, It's not like, oh, we're just gonna start making the pro chip which makes the non-pro chips more prevalent. No, it means they have to stop making these non-pro there's only so much room on the manufacturing line to be making chips. (exasperatingly sighing) The takeaway here is, don't listen to everything you see on Twitter. - Bottom line is this, there is a very real possibility that we get new consoles in the future. But once you start projecting more than 2, 3, 4 years out, the world's a crazy place. I don't even think a lot of people at Sony, Microsoft have their exact plant figured out. And if they do, they're working with AMD and whatever the tech is. Right? but I'll guarantee you this, If it does come TCL didn't know anything about it. Make sure to subscribe, ringling the dingling button for other hot spicy news. So you always get up to date when your buddies Austin and Matt make an emergency episode. And if anyone else tries to leak anything else I'm off the clock. (mellow music)",

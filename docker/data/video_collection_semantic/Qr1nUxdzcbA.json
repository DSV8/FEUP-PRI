    "transcript": "- He really had a thing of not liking me because I used open source. Called me a hippie or something. He had, he was not, nice, kid, but I'm not trusting some long-haired young kid like that with my systems. (electronic music) - Everyone it's David Bombal back with Tom from Lawrence Systems. So I'm really happy to have Tom here because I think for my personal opinion, he's one of the best people to talk to when you want to talk about firewalls specifically pfSense. Tom, welcome. - Thank you, this is exciting. This all started as like a tweet. - It did. - You know, and people are like, I wanna see these two people have a conversation. I'm like, why haven't we had a conversation? So, here we are. - Give us a bit of history. You run your own business, is that right? But you also create YouTube videos. - Yes, so a little bit of history is, and we were laughing 'cause it came up about our tax ID the other day, when we were setting something up for our client. Someone's like your tax ID's, really a low number. And I'm like, we've been in business for 19 years. I didn't realize that myself. I was like, wow. 'Cause I mean, we started, well, I started in 2003 and here we are in 2022. And I'm like, wow, we're pushing, pushing 20 years. Prior to that, even though I was young, I was head of IT for a pretty large transportation provider. We're here in the Detroit area. And transportation related to automotive is just a big part of what runs our industry here in Detroit. My first technical job is actually all the way back in 1994. It's the first time I got working as a job, not a hobby in computers. So yeah, I've got quite the career in it. - I wanna leverage that experience. How long have you been working with pfSense, and you know, could you give us like an idea of like, what is it, is it a router, is it a firewall? What is it? And you know, do you recommend it? I'm assuming you do, 'cause I've seen you create so much content about it. - It started out with m0n0wall. If you remember that, if you were ever working with open source firewalls, there was a handful of different ones in the beginning. And oddly, some of these were used in the corporate world because the flexibility was not there with some of the Cisco equipment when you wanted some really interesting things. - Yeah. - So I started digging into open source firewalls around 2000, oddly enough, somewhere along the lines of all the different ones I tried, which I've lost in history outside of like IPFire, IPCop. And they put IP in front of everything in the early days. Then then came m0n0wall. Now the big difference for m0n0wall, which eventually became the pfSense project was it's BSD-based, and the the PF in pfSense stands for the PF filter system. So, this system is just really robust in BSD. One of the interesting notes about BSD in general is I always joke that BSD does it first. Sometimes Linux does it better, but better is always the later thing. So like the idea of anything from containerization to large scalable networks, this is something that's been available in BSD forever, but Dockers, the hotness today and iptables is very capable in all the different functionality is now in the Linux kernel for these larger state tables and things like that. But early, and this is what made the BSD platform so popular in the large enterprise space and still why companies like Juniper use it is it's always been there for being able to handle not just a home firewall, but actually scale to the business level. So, starting using it, that's somewhere in a 2010-ish or maybe sometime after not, very early days of the project. - Yeah. - Because the project, as I said was kind of, to say it's really a fork, it's more like when they took it over, they called it pfSense as opposed to m0n0wall, but the exact date, I don't remember, but was giving talks on it at open source conferences, which is eventually what led me to the YouTube part of it. - I've seen you answer these kind of questions before, but just do like quickfire, it's open source, is that right? - Yes. - So I mean you can download the source code off GitHub, you can do all that kind of thing, is that right? - Absolutely, I've been a long time open source advocate. I've got one foot in the open source community, the other foot in the hacking community, and the understanding of both of those disciplines going, if you can't see the source, what's in it? And the hacking community goes, I know what we're gonna put in it. And so, you kind of put those two things together and you go, you know, I really think we should be able to validate the code that runs on our devices. It just seems, from a security standpoint, and that was not the most common opinion 10 years ago. Today, it's like, no, no, you know, they're talking about whole software bills that have like, what do they call that? The software inventory reports and everything else. 'Cause people are like, we really need to know what's in here. We need to be able to audit the source code. That's just common 'cause it's a real security concern here in 2022, being able to have everything open source with pfSense is pretty awesome. So you have, you know, full access source code. It's actually very helpful for troubleshooting. 'Cause if you start searching for maybe that error message you get, I've found times when you land on GitHub, 'cause then you can start to go, oh this is the section of code that's giving me this error that then if I, you know, savvy enough to read some of the code, I can go, oh I understand the logic now that built up to this. It's allowed for a lot of people to have plugins within it. 'Cause they have a whole plugin architecture. And if you're a, you know, developer, you can go, oh I can look at the way this is implemented. I can look at the way they speced it out and then I can see how it integrates with the code. So, it's always been huge to me to have firewalls. They sit at the border of everything. So having all the code available for them is really, you know, pretty important to me. - You do a lot of consultancy and you help customers with their networks. Do you deploy a lot of this stuff? - A lot, yeah, there are so many companies using it. Now, obviously one of the things that comes with the trade as you know, is when you do a lot of consultancy, the companies go, no problem, here's your NDA. So you're not gonna talk about us or everything else. They don't list their clients. It's used extensively in the banking systems. Banking industry, we do a lot of consulting in that, especially your smaller, independent banks. They don't trust some of the, even like they want to have leased lines between buildings like the dark fibre type stuff, the non-online tunnels. They still encapsulate again. And pfSense is a really popular edge device for them. So we've done a lot of those type of configurations on them. And then, just a lot of other small businesses in general, pfSense, especially, you know, since the pandemic, the number of pfSense instances we installed dramatically increased because it has all the different VPN models built in. You have WireGuard, you have IPsec, and you have OpenVPN, and all with no limits on it. Limits is really your hardware not licensing. So companies that go, I need 100 people remote now. Oh, how much what's the best solution? So pfSense comes up a lot. - Let's ask you a really nasty question. FirePower or pfSense? (ominous music) - pfSense, yeah, I have shaking my head because I, it was a great post on Reddit. It was a rant about FirePower and it says, is anyone who didn't get a demo license actually using this? And people said, it was too confusing for Cisco to set up, is what someone said. I mean, there's good aspects of it, but like the full breadth of it. I think Cisco, I don't know, it's an interesting, I've done Cisco work, it's not my specialty, but I've yeah. And I know you're a lot more into it. - I'm a Cisco guy, years and years and years, but it's interesting how, like you said, the world has changed. The old days of like everything is like say, in networking is just Cisco, open source has really taken over a lot of areas and become really, really popular. So I mean, it's a nasty question. I knew the answer that I was gonna get, but it's interesting. So, if customers were evaluating like different firewalls, is one of the reasons I think you mentioned is, is that because of the licensing. Is this stuff is cheaper to install? What's the cost of installing like a pfSense firewall? - So, the huge thing that matters to people in the business world, and this is where just because they're looking for free things is sometimes the answer why people like open source and that's not exactly true in the business world. And I think the biggest example on a large scale would be Red Hat. Red Hat is a software company that gives away their software 'cause they do open source, but were bought for $32 billion because of value they create. It's the support that matters. And this is where pfSense, I look at open source projects and evaluate them whether or not there's a plan, a business model. Cool that it's open source, that's step one. Step two, is there a business model that means this is a sustainable project that will have a life? Come the way the pfSense, the stewards of the pfSense project is the Netgate company, and Netgate is, you have a business model selling hardware. And because they're using an open source software and they have a team of developers on staff that the proceeds they make from selling hardware fund the project plus there's the ability to buy support contracts, combine that all together, and this is what makes pfSense a real evaluation. People don't mind paying for support. They're absolutely happy to do so, especially businesses. They're going, what kind of SLA agreements can I get? What's the support contract? And things like that. What business don't like is when they are locked into a product that this is the license deal this year, or next year, it might be more, we're not telling you until the renewal comes up, and that makes businesses nervous, 'cause it's a harder to predict model, but at least support and SLA agreements, they're pretty steady and they're very predictable. So, that's a big thing that goes in there is the less confusing licensing. Oh cool, the support contract per device is this. End of story. Whatever we wanna do with it. If we have 10 users or 100 users as a hardware scaling, not a license scaling issue. - Take us down the sort of the journey like, okay, so I want to deploy this at my house. What device would you recommend? Is it like a hardware device or is it virtual? - For the home user, it starts with the question of, do you wanna load it yourself? I highly encourage people to, because we, let's put our hands in some hardware, let's have some fun. Let's build this from scratch. And you can use any basically x86 computer that has two network cards in it. Highly recommend you use some Intel cards. Matter of fact, go on eBay, you find all those little four port cards. This is a great way for you to learn the hardware ins and outs. But, that's not for everybody. If you want to buy a turnkey device that just works, they make a little box that's, depending on where you're at, pricing, right around the $200 that you can buy directly from Netgate. And this is the SG-1100. This is a clever little box that comes preloaded. It's actually based on ARM. And I said, x86 for pfSense downloads, but there are a handful of certain devices made by Netgate that do support ARM. There's a very specific compilation they do for ARM, but it's not available to the public. Still the same open source software, different compilation and these ARM devices, they're nice for inexpensive. It's very low-power. So if that's a concern, that's one of the advantages you get with ARM. And the nice thing about this, it's the same pfSense. Now, obviously there's some trade-offs. If you go with a little $200 box and you go, but I have Gigabit internet or 2.5 GB internet, I'm sorry, it's not gonna route. And if you want to set up 20 remote users with VPN, well, I have some bad news, it's not gonna route very fast. There's gonna be some limitations. And Netgate has boxes that just keep scaling upwards as you go. Or of course, the third option I'll at least give a mention to, 'cause I do my labs in this. It can be virtualized in VMware, Proxmox, and XCP-ng. You can virtualize these. Obviously, you have to have a pretty good understanding of virtualization and how to manage your WAN and things like that. So, it's not always a recommended one. It's more advanced and there's some other challenges that can come with setting things up in WAN because when you start leveraging hardware offload, hence I mentioned the Intel cards. If you to do things like control flow streams, and stuff that's built into those more advanced networking chips, well, those don't exist in your, in the same way in your virtualization stack, unless you have something like IRVOT where you pass the network card into the VM. So now, you made it more complicated again, but it's absolutely for people who are playing in labs, which is me a lot of times. I love my virtualization installs because I can build scenarios very, very quickly. - Is it like VMware workstation or is it ESXi? Which VMware is supported, did you say? - Both a matter of fact, I will throw VirtualBox in there for those you just want to run it there, you can definitely set this up and get it working in VirtualBox. If you just wanna play with a lab environment, one of the fun things about it is when you're doing in virtualization, I know there's all kinds of cool networking software out there that will help you build things. But, I like building it with some real virtualized installs and setting things up. I mean, you can pfSense to go all the way out there. Well you mentioned like, you know, your knowledge on BGP and things like that. Well, you can build your own BGP lab with a couple pfSenses and load FRR and get 'em talking to each other, and build your own simulated BGP with two pfSenses. - What about Raspberry Pi, it's supported in that? - No, that's when I do my 2022 video, that's actually gonna be when I cover the hardware, though, the first things I'm gonna say, 'cause it's the most common question that's in the list is, can I load it on Raspberry Pi? I don't think there's any plans for the Pi because the Netgate hardware is, and ARM is so specific and they, the compilation they have is very unique for the Netgate. Like for each model they have, they have a different compilation for that specific model, that specific board. So I don't think it's ever gonna be out there where someone builds compilations in ARM of pfSense. I don't see it as a likely scenario. - What would you recommend if I'm starting, buy the device or just virtualizing, like VirtualBox and create a lab? - Yeah, if you wanna play with it in a lab environment, absolutely virtualizing. It is great. But if you, I'm really partial, especially just 'cause of the learning curve and where home lab people often are, buying some type of hardware device is great. Then that is, they have a model now, the 6100 series that has 10 GB ports on it. That's in the $700 range depending on where you're at. So, now you have a router with two 10 GB SFP+ ports on it and a several other ports, I think there's six ports in total on that box. And you're talking under $1,000 to get something that will, A. route at your high speed one GB or even faster internet that you may have at your home. So, I'm shocked that the number of people that seem to have access to 2.5 GB at home recently, it seems like that's been a great rollout, which is awesome. But of course that brings you the question of, I need something fast enough to route this because you, most of your consumer stuff you're gonna find at a big box store just can't handle that level of speed. So, the 6100 by Netgate, nice turnkey supported by Netgate. They come with some basic levels of support with the option to buy more if you need it. So for home users, they usually don't and the forums are a wonderful place to get support. There's a subreddit for it. And of course my videos, I've got tons of walkthroughs on how to do pretty much from the time you turn it on, till getting all kinds of advanced features set up on there. - Yeah, I'm gonna link those below. 'Cause I mean, and I'll say this for everyone, you know, go and look at Tom's YouTube channel, go and subscribe. He's got a lot of great content about this. So this is more like high-level trying to like give real world direction. Okay, so for home, you've you've given us some recommendations. You, again, you deploy this stuff all the time, so small, medium business, and you could just pick a customer perhaps as a, like a use case, which device did you use? What problem did it solve, et cetera? - Real world use case we have for a lot of these is we had a, one of the bigger ones was a medical facility and they have about 7,000 users on it. And then, we just set them up with a pair of 7100s. We put them in HA mode. Now, a cool thing about HA mode and I even have a demo of how to do this on their lowest end hardware. That a little 1100 I mentioned, you can buy the most basic pfSense and all those features, you can put BGP on it. You can set it up in HA mode, and that's the $200 box. Get to the several $1,000 boxes, the real world use case will have is obviously high availability means a lot to people. And that comes back to some of the licensing because there is no licensing for HA on pfSense. And this is something, 'cause I had previously replaced a company that, their firewalls had the price, but then the HA price, as they put, it was a bit ridiculous. And it's common. They're like, 'cause everything's an upsell. Like, what other feature can we sell you? So, we actually swapped out all their commercial. If you, I don't know, commercial's the right word, 'cause obviously pfSense is still commercial, but equipment that required extensive licensing, we'll say. - (chuckles) You won't mention a name, but yes. I'm kind of getting a drift here, but go on. - Yeah, but we replaced all that and we were able to look at everything that was set up in the previous equipment, match all the features, also offer them HA, and somewhere along the lines, the person bidding against us with what was offering the previous solution, told us it was not possible to these things with pfSense, but it's been installed for a few years. Now, it's got all the proper segmentation, VLANs, being that it's in a medical facility they have really strict rules for how things are set up. So, you know, you have your equipment networks, which is very locked down and private. They actually have a separate guest network. And there's plenty of interfaces on these two, not just set 'em up as VLANs. 'Cause the problem of VLANs is the shared medium. You know, there's bandwidth considerations when you have 7,000 variety of people and devices to get connected on there. But by doing all this and using, you know, breaking out each one, setting up segmentation on a network, they just had a handful of public IPs. They're actually in, this is not something everyone's completely familiar with, but the different traffic inspection requirements, things like Snort, and Snort is actually owned by Cisco. And Cisco's done an actually a good job of keeping up all the intelligence feeds. Cisco hides it, so I don't think Cisco publicly says that like in their, they'll say they're doing traffic inspection, but honestly their IDS systems are all based on Snort if I'm not mistaken, right? - Yeah, I dunno that all the detail, 'cause I know they've been doing a lot of acquisitions and things are changing, but yeah, I know they've got Snort and they push Snort a lot in a lot of products. - Yeah, it's inside a lot of their products. But the way pfSense does it is, you can still buy those feeds. Matter of fact, you can still buy the Snort feeds from Cisco and plug them in inside if you need to do 'cause traffic inspection frequently, get into an enterprise network, they need to do some levels of IDS, intrusion systems. So, we are able to put all these solutions together in one device. Now, granted you're gonna have to buy the feeds, but you have to pay the subscriptions anyways. But paying a subscription for a threat intelligence feed is substantially less of course, than buying all the licenses for some of the other products. And, but back to that thing we brought up earlier, being a medical place, this is, everything's critical. They do have an internal staff, but the internal staff contracted us. So we worked hand-in-hand with them to, you know, figure out the solution, deploy the solution, and of course at the end of the day, they want some support agreements. So they bought SLA agreements from, they bought 'em directly from Netgate for there, we're the tier support for all the configuration and setup. And when we're done, we hand the keys to the kingdom, if you will back over to their internal IT team. So they do all the day-to-day maintenance on it, make sure all the VPNs are working 'cause they have some things that are remote. And it also has all the remote sites tied in there. This is something well, we're slowly moving. 'Cause in the most recent year, WireGuard has become very popular. Normally IPSec VPNs are popular and still in use. They're probably still the business standard when you have site-to-site things set up. And being medical, within the, actually kind of fun story, when we do these third-party medical companies, there's one large medical conglomerate here in Detroit and they now have writeups from us on how to interop pfSense with their networks. And, they recognized when my staff was setting up one of the medical offices and we have to do IPSec between pfSense and they use Cisco, but they have the interops and they're like, oh you're the Lawrence guys. That's actually what they tell my staff when they're talking to 'em. They know us now and they have their own internal documentation and the guys had watched some of my videos on it, which I thought was really funny. So I got to interact with some of the people that are the internal IT for this large healthcare conglomerate. But, 'cause interoperability is still there. You know, we've in, so this medical place, we set 'em up full interop with their other companies that they need to get the scans and x-rays and all the stuff that I don't know what all it is. I know it's all the, it looks like a bunch of x-ray stuff. We try to separate ourselves. We don't don't ever show patient stuff. - Yeah, I get that. I mean it's, I wanted to ask you now that we are getting to the weeds a little bit about commercial. So, if I was going to buy a pfSense just so that everyone understands, what's the actual cost? - The hardware's really the only cost because you can download it for free. Now, there's a little bit of a schism in there's pfSense and pfSense Plus. pfSense is the project, pfSense Plus is a product. And there's a few extra features you get with pfSense Plus. They do have the, it's kind of like a license that you can buy. They currently give it away for free, but they said the price is gonna be like $179 a year. And it's just referred to as tack life support. So it's that, that's just the terminology used by the team over at Netgate where you can buy this. If you want, you can still use the other one for free. But if you go for this, you get some support agreements, it's a few hundred dollars a year, it's relatively inexpensive. And if you want like full few hour SLA agreements, you can just hit the little pull down on the license and contact Netgate and register your product for the higher end licenses if needed. And this is what some of the businesses do, they go, oh, it's only, I think their pricing right now is somewhere in the few, like in $800, $900 a year. And, for an SLA agreement that has like a guaranteed four hour response, which is, that's why I said that is so inexpensive. So many companies go, well, that's it? Well, just throw it in a bill. Like they're not even, it's not even a question at that point. They're like, we thought you were gonna say that much a month is usually how some of the responses go. Now, the cool thing you get with pfSense Plus, there's the upsell they have and this is not part of their open source repository. So, the pfSense Plus is still based on pfSense. It is still the same open source firewall, but the add-ons are kind of proprietary that Netgate offers, but they're not ones that home users care about. So I let I tell home users, if you don't need it, don't use it. There's some VPN import exports. There's a AWS wizard. So, in a lot of people and we have a few use cases like this, where they have their pfSense tied to their AWS instance for all their programming. So even though employees are working at an office, they need an always on IPSec VPN. And being able to just throw in a wizard to connect you to AWS in your instance where all your servers are, is great. That way you're not publicly exposing your AWS necessarily. Everything has to be piped through the tunnel. It's a great feature to have because it's so much easier to sit up than having to go through. I mean easy for us, but the average person doesn't set up IPSec every day goes, how do I get the AWS instance? If you have the pfSense Plus and use the wizard, you're like, oh, I can just drop my ID in here? And it'll contact call and be done? Click, all right, great, thanks. (chuckles) - We've been discussing a lot of like the great things about pfSense, are they in your experiences, there anything that it can't do where you've have to go to, let's say a non-open source, like solution, like some from of the big companies. Is there anything where you've like, okay, this pfSense is not the right product. I need to get like a FirePower or something else. - Absolutely, so I'm very open about this because I tell people, they come up with like some predefined list. We need these specific things and no exception, these have to be in there. Well, then pfSense may not be for you. The big one's gonna be pfSense, despite, I'm critical of this, they say, oh, we do traffic inspection, full SSL. And pfSense is a headache and I won't support it. I won't sell it, I won't set it up. So someone who goes, I want full traffic inspection, full SSL termination. Hmm, that's just not something pfSense is great at, they're still using Squid, but it's just a lot of work to manage. So, if you have a very defined requirement that you have to do full traffic inspection, and there's not many firewalls out there that will do TLS 1.3 inspection where they use the double encryption, essentially, where you have the inner, I call 'em inner and outer keys, but it's that second Diffie-Hellman exchange. So the layer is in there. The only way to do that is to set up a lot of interesting things inside of a firewall. There's very few companies that are able to do this. So they can basically terminate TLS 1.3, between the endpoint and the firewall, and then the website and the firewall, which of course you have to put bypasses in for anyone who uses certificate pinning, Google, PayPal. It just becomes this big challenge. So, any of that type of work, pfSense is just not your ideal firewall. So if that is your hard line requirement. Now when you're working in the enterprise space, a lot of people don't realize you have often separated devices. So the traffic inspection is either, A. just done by some other application loaded on the endpoint or by a separate device, a proxy in their network. So you'll see actually these corporate companies, 'cause some people think you can't use pfSense 'cause traffic inspections are a requirement in enterprise. I'm like, it's a requirement? Frequently, yes, they have very strict rules around it, but that's often done by a separate device. And you know, Cisco makes some of these proxies that are specifically for web filtering. They're dedicated devices because once you ratchet it up to needing that full TLS 1.3 inspection, usually you need some dedicated hardware if you have a few thousand users, it's not something your edge device necessarily does. - When you say small, medium, you like said 7,000 users for your, that medical, so that's quite big already. What's the biggest that you've done? And I mean, if it's NDA, don't worry about it, but kind of give us like a ballpark. - Yeah, without going through that, I can't reveal, there's one of 'em that's a product that would've been heard of by everyone. And it's what sits at their data center levels. The scale they operate that at is amazing to me because I'm like, wow, I did not realize pfSense was sitting at the edge of this. Now it's obviously passing traffic through. There are certain limitations and this is what they were running into. They're hitting a scalability problem. And we won't get too off-topic on this, but there is a alternative product from Netgate and the reason they developed it is 'cause they realized some of these people are like, hey, we scaled, but this million user problem we have? - A million users. Okay, so that's crazy, yeah. - It's based on hits. It's external 'cause it's being forwarded through the pfSense. But when they get to these really large scale, they make another product called Tensor and Tensor is based on vector packet routing and is able to scale to another level. So, because you can't have a pfSense that kits the 100 GB, it's just gonna have a lot of problems. 10 GB you can do in pfSense, depending on the processor, individual states, streams are only gonna be limited to about 2 GBs or some BSD kernel limitations. That next level scale comes into vector packet routing, which oddly is an open source thing from Cisco. - That's great, so, I mean, let's talk about scaling then because, so, if you, your biggest interface did you say is 10 GB? Is that the highest speed you would go? - Yeah, once you get bigger than 10 GB, you kind of have to start looking at separating things out. pfSense is not really a 25 GB or 100 GB product right now. I don't know where it will be in the future, but there's some fundamental limitations it starts to have at there. So, it starts to, it's the number of states and the way states are processed inside the kernel. This is completely why. And this is actually interesting feature. If you start with a piece of Netgate hardware and you run into some of these limitations, Netgate actually supports swapping the operating system to be Tensor, which is another open source project they have. It would be more familiar with people. It doesn't have a web interface. It's all command line driven, but it's something used more at a data center level at the large scale data center. So you now you need that even faster routing, you need those higher scalable systems you get often at those. We don't do much with Tensor. When people run into some of those problems, we just start deferring 'em to Netgate 'cause Netgate's the only expert consultant I'm aware of on the Tensor product. - And then how many like VPN connections could we have? Like, can you give us, like, where would you, and this is just your opinion, like where would you be like comfortable, like using pfSense? - We have a lot in the 100 user range. That's really not a problem. We frequently have it set up and you know, where they're we tie pfSense to their active directory. So it's part of their normal log and part of their Windows and everything else. You can take the Oppa VPN authentication, you can use RADIUS or you can use LDAP and then you can tie it into there. We have a lot of businesses in that category for all their remotes. We actually have a Colo that we set up and I'm trying to remember exactly how many, they have a pretty big development team that's scattered globally. And their new dev team all remotes into pfSense with a series of well, they wanna move to WireGuard because they've run into some problems when you start having a lot of users and a high-bandwidth problem. OpenVPN, OpenVPN's new features' gonna be faster. But where it's at today, there's certain limitations because it doesn't multi-thread very well with the encryption. So we're moving some people over to looking at WireGuard solutions to be able to be a little bit faster. WireGuard has its own challenges, 'cause it doesn't have any user management, but that gets a little deep into weeds and off topic, but it's not uncommon for people to have, you know, 8,000 people set up in there, all authenticating on there. As long as you have a fast enough hardware to run it, you're generally pretty good. - So 8,100 concurrent VPN users, like 10 GB interface, that's kind of where you comfortable. Any other like sort of guidelines based on your experience? - That starts to put the where limit is in some of the pfSense. And I know this does rule out some of the larger where you might start recommending going, hey, you know, 'cause if someone said, I have this, and Juniper's one of the big ones we see a lot of out there. Someone says, hey, I got this many, I got a million users. I have some incredible amount. This when we're gonna go, you know, it may not be the right fit for you. I get people's enthusiasm, but there are some scaling limitations. The other options gonna be something like Tensor, which is gonna be a little bit harder to configure. 'Cause it doesn't have the web interface. But yeah, there are some upper limits where I think you go, okay, maybe not pfSense for you. So that mid-market, I would say is probably a better market for 'em. - Let's say I'm a younger person. I am thinking of starting a consultancy business like you. I know you've had videos or you've created videos on this in the past, but what's your advice? I'm 21 or 25, like kind of when you started, what, you've done this now, what would you advise someone to do if they were thinking about doing a consultancy business? - For the consultancy side, spend a lot of time understanding how to provide a solution to the customer, not just being technically adept. That's something where technicians fail as a business. They are very technical and they may understand very deeply how to configure firewall, how to write these rules, how to set up BGP. But if you can't understand how that provides an efficiency, solves a problem for the business, that's where that disconnect comes in from. Owning a business to just being a consultant, 'cause some people go well, I work for this person and they're billing me out at double my rate. So I could be making that much more myself. It's the first thought they have and they want to go out on their own, but then they realize the salesperson, despite the weird relationship between salespeople and technical people, they are, if you're not thinking from the perspective of how does this tool I know, how does these technical skills leverage a way to say, hey, I can make your business more efficient. I can save your users some key strokes. I can make their ease of setting up these computers better. I can solve this problem. I can get your remote workers connected without a lot of problems. If you start with that, I mean, I could talk to you about the best settings for OpenVPN and the best encryption to use, but you're gonna glaze over and a person goes, well, how does this help So-and-so in accounting get connected without a lot of questions. That's the thing you have to think of from consultancy of why someone would hire you is understanding your value proposition you will bring to the table on that. - How much like of your time, how much is it technical and how much is like people? I mean now it's obviously changed 'cause the business is matured, but like in the beginning, did you have to go and like try and do the sales role? Stuff like that? - Oh yes, so starting young and having long hair turns out not a great idea. - (chuckles) Especially years ago. Maybe not so bad now, but like years ago. - I mean not so bad now, but I'll never forget, it was right around probably 2005. I had met with a pretty good-size company. Thought we were the right person for the job, pitched him on it. And I had to do all the sales in the beginning. That's you know how it works until you can hire a salesperson and I just was good at it. So, I'm doing the sales and everything else and they didn't, they thought I left after the conference room, but I actually went into their little conference room on the next side and got some coffee, but I got to hear the conversation and they said, nice kid, but I'm not trusting some long-haired young, young kid like that with my systems. I thought that was funny. So I got to hear that. I'm like, I was a little aggravated, but then I said, you know, I'll take this to heart. I'll think about this of how I present myself and make sure I'm not too cocky or anything like that. - But you didn't cut your hair, did you? - No, no, it's still, I've had long hair my whole life. - Starting a business, I'm assuming like tech skills are not 90% of it. That's just a much smaller part. So, you know, could you like gimme an indication like, you know, tech skills in the beginning were everything 'cause you were in a corporate environment, then you had to like reduce that skill set and then develop other skills. - You know, I started really learning the sales skills oddly in corporate and I will tell you, this is something that you don't have to start a business to have these sales skills. I think you should have them if you want to advance your career, because when you're sitting there at the table and you want to pitch to the finance officer, to whoever's in that room, why you need to add this piece of technology, this is where a lot of people have trouble as an IT. They're like, oh, they wouldn't approve my security budget. They wouldn't approve my procurement of this hardware that's needed to critically, you know, they wouldn't gimme enough resources to keep things updated. And now we're under, we're gonna be attacked if we don't. Frequently, the purse strings are gonna be tight at a company. They're trying to understand the value. If you can't sell the value to the people above you. And I'm not saying it's always that you can, or it's always, it's not blaming the system in here, but there has to be a strong understanding of how you solve the problem as the IT, I, as a sysadmin as a see so. And you're selling it to the other people there. Understanding and being able to sell the teams you're on and being able to sell why we need this product, why we need these things. I thought made me a better sysadmin, because I always had the budget to get a lot of things done. And when you're talking about, I said, I saved keystrokes in the corporate world and accounting. Well, if you can say, all right, here's a solution. If you give me about a $100,000 to hire a programmer, I'm going to save you from hiring two more people in accounting when we do this expansion project, that's a sales proposition. I mean, you say I want $100,000 to make the system better. They're going, no, we ain't giving you $100,000 to make the system better. What does that mean? But when you can equate it to, and this is completely, you know, before I had my business, I can make it more efficient. So as our growth opportunity as this company, we were taking on some new business. I said, if there's less key strokes, but we can increase our business. That means your accountants, you don't have to hire as many people in that team to expand because we're gonna solve it with a software efficiency. They go, oh, that, the ROI, okay, we can chart this because if we're paying each account in 40K to 50K a year, and the ROI is only get to a one time cost of $100,000 means, all right, that's gonna pay off only in a little over a year. That's great, perfect. Let's do it. And I took those same skills as when I started my business. So, when that company, it would be a, I've thought about doing a rant on all the craziness that happened that caused that company to topple. It had everything to do with greed and disorganization and the IRS. So, but the, when I turned them, what was left to that company into some of my first customers, that's how I started my business. But I started my business in, and this kept picking up more and more sales things, but I've always thought about it from those solutions. So, I think those sales soft skills are incredibly important for your career advancement. It's how you're gonna get ahead. It's how you're going to move up the ladder and not just be a technical person. But then first, is that your goal? Some people are, and I know I employ a few of 'em. They have zero interest in ever running a business and they're like, they wanna be technical. They love technical problem solving, not talking to people. If you can keep throwing technical problems and not talking to people, I got a few of those people that work for me, they're thrilled where they're at. They're really happy and not, that's where their goal is. But if your goal is that career advancement, your goal is, or even to start a business, having those sales skills and understanding how you're putting a solution together is huge. - You keep saying that. And I think that's the important thing is you keep saying, don't look at the technical product, look at the benefit that it provides to the customer. And that's why, you know, it's great to see how you talk. You're like, I'm not, you're not religious about pfSense, you're trying to help the customer. And if the solution is not right then, well, we'll pick another solution, is that correct? - Yeah, we're always an advocate for the customer. I always start there. It's one of the reasons we try to shy away from, with the exception of things that only offer partner programs. We, you know, as much as I've just talked about pfSense, since if you go to the resellers list, you'll find my name not on there. I've been accused of secretly being on there. And I'm like, no, we seriously are not resellers. That is to show that there's no implicit bias we have with the product. They do offer like partner programs. We just aren't part of it. And we avoid a lot of that because I started as an advocate for the customer. This is just like an ethos we have about the way we do things. So a lot of the products, people are surprised that sometimes we don't even recommend buying. 'em. Matter of fact, we had a massive project we did where we installed, I mean, I say massive. It's not absolutely huge, but good-size 300 unified access points. And people are like, okay, that's decent size. And when we bid the project, the customer said they have an internal IT team. They're a big enough company for that. They were looking at different outside companies to do it. And everyone wanted sell 'em the hardware. And they said, you know, we know how much the hardware costs because you don't need to be a partner to buy UniFi equipment. I said, yeah, you're right. Go buy it yourself. Really, you'll bid like that? I said, sure. My value is the labor. You need someone to engineer, right? And he said, yeah. I said, you need someone to install it? And he said, yeah. I said, all right. So just bid on labor and install and engineering. I said, no problem. You guys go find the best deal. Matter of fact, I gave them one of our contacts for buying that many of 'em that would give 'em a good deal. And I, 'cause I said, well the hardware's erased to $0. And because we became like a partner with them on that, so to speak and then what we charged, they knew our rates are not cheap. We are very proud of what we charge. And so they were clear, it was up front. They're like the labor's going to be this to install all this and done. It was, they were like, this is great. You guys are easy to work with because we understand the value you're bringing to the table. - Yeah, I mean, at the end of the day, you're building a relationship, aren't you? You don't wanna just get a quick buck of one sale. How long have you had your longest customer? And I mean, I'm assuming this is where, you know, you it's the long term relationship, isn't it? - Yeah, it is my very first customer zero techie, customer one was from the company that came out of the company I used to work for. So, when the company I worked for went under, they were split into different pieces. Well, no one piece wanted to take on me as an employee or me as a salary. So that's where I started my company was those different companies, which immediately became at war with each other. But didn't seem to mind that I was IT for both. 'Cause they were in a competitive battle for bidding, but they have all got absorbed and some of 'em just dissolved and went into different companies. But out of them, the people is an interesting, how I got the next few customers is as some of those companies broke apart, the people said, I know a guy. So they would go work for another company and the same thing in the transportation industry. So some of these transportation clients, like the first ones we signed up in 2004 and 2005 are still clients today. We had a brief period, we left where one of 'em disappeared for a little while. And then a full force came back to us 'cause they hired an IT guy that really, he thought open source was the most terrible word in the world and couldn't believe when they hired him as IT. He really had a thing of not liking me because I used open source. Called me a hippie or something. He was not. - (laughs) Well, you're not helping with the look either. - Oh no, I wasn't helping. So, me and him just oil and water. And eventually he put them in a bind and they had a lot of security problems. And after they ousted him, they started with some new people. And new people said, hey, this guy's local that's got these videos, which turned out, when they called us, they found out we used to do work for 'em and now we we've done so much work. The last couple years has been amazing. It's like when they were small and now they're huge. I mean this place has got buildings everywhere, and very large transportation provider. And now we're doing, we co-managed IT with their IT teams. We do the infrastructure builds. I'd actually posted these. They're the same size as the Amazon warehouses. 'Cause someone asked if I was doing an Amazon warehouse. When I posted the Twitter pictures of the warehouses we're building, wiring infrastructure side and I'm like, they're adjacent to Amazon. They're the same size warehouses. The Amazon's on one side of the parking lot. This company's big enough that their warehouses are the same as the Amazon centers next door. - I mean, you mentioned that and I wanted to actually ask you, it was my next question. Why do you have a YouTube channel? - I love sharing knowledge. And as you know, there's an absolute need for more people in technology. So, I love open source conferences. A Linux conference or a hacking conference. Hacking conferences are almost always like to me like a big show and tell. So they're just fun to go to 'cause hackers are always like, look what I hacked and have to show you right away. And open source is very much the same. Hey look at these cool things you can do. And so I was giving a talk on firewalls. And one of those things where someone said, hey, 'cause there was only so many seats that could be in the room for this particular talk and track and someone says, will this be on YouTube? And I kinda said, you know, I don't have a YouTube channel. And they go, well, that's a shame. I'm like, well I'm technical enough to set one up. So, some of my earliest videos were YouTube videos about firewalls. Fast forward today, the YouTube channel slowly has evolved. It's actually, I'm very open about this is our inbound lead process. We do videos. We give away an absolute ton of information, and my videos are extremely based on my experience. So, I mentioned we have a large company. We're selling these petabyte storage service too. So I have a whole video on how to set up and configure the petabyte storage. The video is actually, when I was done with that video, as soon as I published it on YouTube, I sent the link to the client 'cause he says, hey, what's the best strategy for setting up 60 hard drives? I'm like, I'm gonna do a video on it because, one, you're interested, two, I bet the audience is too. So, a lot of 'em serve double purpose. We've literally sent, I have a video on doing transparent Suricata traffic inspection, kind of a weird thing to do with a pfSense. It's a demo video for a very large enterprise client. It manages all their SCADA devices. It's, that's the real world implementation. They put it in to do transparent management of SCADA devices that can't be down ever 'cause it's a 24/7 facility that, they're a huge company, manufacturing and they wanna know how to do it. So they contracted me for all the setup and we sent them the config files. But I also, in addition to, I said, do you care if the video's public? It doesn't name their name, of course, it doesn't need to. It's just how to do it. And so the whole video is now their tutorial on exactly how to set up these systems and that each plant they have all across the United States has these systems at it. It all kind of relates back to my YouTube channel of, I love sharing that experience. Hopefully, heading people off before they find out a product has a problem or a flaw. I like to, I'm very open about them. It's also one of the reasons when I do, I'm still working exactly how I'm gonna do sponsorships. I get a ton of companies wanting to request to pay and I've been very, very cautious about that because reputation to me is everything. So I'm always. - I agree, yeah, hard. - Yeah, I'm working out like ads that are adjacent. I didn't wanna sell mattresses, so I haven't taken any of those ads. I want something at least technical. (Both laugh) - It's amazing what people want to sponsor. I get the same, you know? - Yeah, you get the same ones and I don't wanna shill 'cause I think it's oversold is, everyone's selling a privacy VPN, and pretending like it's the end all solution to your security, and I'm like, no, no it's oversold by everyone on YouTube. Not because they need it, but because it's so easy for VPN companies to sell. If a product is easily sold and we can tell you, you need a privacy VPN for everything. So I try to be very careful on product reviews, sponsorships. I turn down anyone who wants me to, I won't do paid reviews ever. I have a content ethics policy published on my website and on my channel. So I'm just very upfront with people on there. - Yeah, I must say, I must say this, this video is not sponsored by any VPN provider. So, there we go. - There we go. - No, but I wanted to take it back now for people who are starting in their career. You, big into Linux, open source. What skills do you reckon are really important for people to learn in 2022? Like if you were starting at, you know, where would you focus? - The demand right now in the marketplace for people who, it depends on the path. If you wanna go into the coding, learning the Linux and understanding a lot of, learn Linux right now is definitely a great way to start. - Yeah, it is. Everyone needs to learn Linux yeah. - Yeah, everyone needs to learn it. All the different cloud enabled things are not running Microsoft platforms. It's just not where it's at. Yeah, everyone's trying to build web apps. I've commented this many times where if you look at anyone who's going to code the next thing, any of the next things that are coming out are web-enabled programs. Well, all that has a backend that's 99% of the time gonna be running on a series of, you know, MariaDB and your Linux stack. Getting into any of the cloud automation and deployment stuff, the jobs that are unfilled right now just blow my mind. My friend works for the Linux Foundation directly, and you know, he's extremely skilled at designing complete self-healing servers that can be spun up where, you know, you have all the data set up completely. So the servers are ephemeral from the data. So you can just destroy 'em and rebuild them in a very automated way. But people who understand that automation and orchestration, Ansible, Kubernetes, and everything else, there's the job demand for it is really, really high. It's something accessible that you can learn. There's a lot to learn once you wrap your head around it. But boy, the demand for that market space right now is huge. The other side is security. It ain't going nowhere. There's definitely. - Yeah, it's really hot at the moment. It's been growing a lot. - Yeah, you know, you've had John Hammond on here before and he's, me and John are friends because we use the product for the company that John works for. It's part of the cybersecurity stack that we deploy for our managed clients. But it's, learn a little bit of Python. Doesn't require are in-depth. You don't be a Python expert, but having a little Python helps you understand some of the tooling in security, helps you understand the investigations, doing these Hack The Box challenges so you understand how to get into these boxes 'cause once you understand how to get in, that's the first step into figuring out how to keep people out of those boxes. So, absolutely diving into to some of the security of it is huge. So, it kind of depends on what, those are the two paths I see that there's like an absolute, huge demand for. I'm not gonna say there's no demand for people with network certifications and things like that. It's there. It's definitely, if you have a CCNA or any of those, you can get a job. There's no doubt. I don't know where the future lies in some of that. As much as I see people, the demand that I see on like the Linux and containerization. I mean, eventually someone's gotta learn BGP 'cause clearly no one understands it 'cause every time there's an outage, it's either DNS or BGP. And the reason it's DNS or BGP is 'cause there's so few people that understand BGP. One of my other friends I love, I wish I could get him to do an interview. He works for the largest company, which was actually previously Arbor Networks. They recently were quashed, he worked for Arbor, works at our company, but his stories over a drink of what actually happens in BGP. He's, it's stupidity at a level. You go, no, no this has to be malicious. And he's like, Tom, I wish it was. He goes, I really wish. He goes, I can't publicly, you know, can't go on on camera saying it. But he's just like, there's some people that I can't believe what they did. He goes, you ever wonder why internet went out in part of an area, like maybe an entire Eastern seaboard. He goes, yeah, that was one of the more public ones is Verizon when they did their outage. That was just ridiculous. And it had to do with someone pushed a bad BGP route and they didn't validate it. It's really, it's no more, people thought it was some type of cyber attack. Like no, seriously it was a bad BGP route that someone, and he goes, I actually know the someone, 'cause he works there, he talks to on the phone. He's like, I called him like, why'd you accept that route? Like, you broke everything. Yeah, we can't get back to our routers. He goes, really? He goes, we have to drive out there, aren't we? He goes, you sure are. Like, he's like. - The problem is we're all human, that's the problem. - We're all humans. Yeah, we gotta get the humans out of this. That's the advantage when you build the automation. You build it, but then again, I mean the Facebook outage late last year, good example of automation gone wrong, so. - What's the dumbest stuff you've seen? - We took over a client that had got hacked and I love that, and they were using pfSense, completely coincidental. And we thought it was great because we knew the product. They had a lot of terrible firewall rules that opened up a lot of things, including their phone system was just wide open to the public, but in the comments, when you create rules, you can put a comment. And whenever you create a rule, there's a comment, the user that did it and the date. And it was about a year earlier from the previous IT people, I don't know what's wrong, is what they put in there. But opening up fixes it. I will fix later. It turns out if you have a free PBX with a really bad password and you expose it to the internet, someone on the internet will use it because their phone bill is actually what clued 'em onto it, which is the funniest thing. Their phone bill was astronomical and it's because they had hacked the system and turned it into a call center for some, I don't know if it was, I don't know what they were trying to call, but the list of numbers was just everyone. They were just dialing numbers cuz it was a free, someone found like a free system. - I mean, it's interesting 'cause on YouTube, if you create a video. Yeah, you know what it's like with YouTube comments? It's hilarious. Sometimes it's like you create a demo, just a demo, something specifically. And everyone says, that'll never happen in the real world because you're right. Because you think you don't do it, no one else is gonna do it. But we both know that normal people, not techies, but normal people don't do it the same way. Any other crazy stories? - Another big company we co-managed for, they have an internal IT department. He had a bad SFP. And based on the things he showed me, one of the ports on his core switch is a core 10 GB switch. And I said, you know, that really does look like a bad SFP. I'd try swapping it. And he swapped it. Oddly, he had two bad SFPs because the other one he swapped would, the fiber thing kept flapping as well, kept going on and off. Somewhere along his thought process was, maybe I'll reset the switch. But instead of resetting it, he cleared the config. And when he did that, the UniFi switches, when you do this, well go back to a default mode. Now he had VLANs and he had about 4,000 users, lots of VLANs to keep everything separated. But when you remove all of that, you suddenly re-DHCP your whole network and everything else. The funny part is when he called me, he goes, he called and left a voicemail 'cause it's early in the morning before we open. And he's like, I know he did something terrible. The moment I hit reset, I knew everything was gonna go to chaos. He goes, but I waited a minute and it came up and everything went to chaos. And I called him back and he's just apologizing. I said, don't apologize. He goes, tell me you can push the config. I said, you're in luck. I said, when we were last seeing your network, this is where I saved all your backups for your config. He goes, I had it. I didn't back it up beforehand. And I'm like, oh, I know I that's why every time we made a change, we had it saved to config file. Do you keep those? I said, or did you delete 'em? He's like, I didn't delete anything you did. So we logged into that server. We found the old config and pushed it. I'm just like, he's like, he goes, I've been a sysadmin for 20 years. He goes, I don't know why I did this. And that's what he kept saying. I don't know why I did this. And, then we brought it back and we went back to flapping problem. And the third SFP worked perfectly fine. So, but it was just long. And he had to pay the bill for, you know, emergency service, getting it all reconfigured. And it was really weird 'cause I think it's hard 'cause this is an experience. I respect him, he's a very smart guy. It was just so, the disappointment is funny. It's just, we all do stupid things sometimes, it's. - We're humans. We've all done it. - Yeah. - I mean I think if you're honest, we've all done dumb things. - My employees have made fun of me 'cause there is at least one time Tom was logged into, I thought I was updating a fire, I went to update a firewall and I'd swear I had logged into the one at my house. I'm like, I don't wanna push an update 'cause no one's home. And I'm actually using pfSense at home, I wasn't logged in a home. I was logged in at work and I was, 'cause I had both of 'em up and you know, my employees were talking to me and getting distracted. I was just like, hey da, da, da, da. And then I hit update and it updated. The update went well. It took everyone down, knocked all our phones off, broke all the sessions that were currently in use. The number of employees hanging out on my office. They all were staring at mere. Like I, and I just kinda did this. And they're like, well they said, I guess it's a lunch break? I was like, yes? - Is this when you get taken off the technical stuff and you like pushed into like, you must wear a suit now? - Yeah, so sometimes you're like, yeah, Tom, we're gonna say just don't play with anything while it's live. We all have work to do, Tom. So, I will, I've need those mistakes. I don't know, you're just not paying attention. I'll admit I am human. I think we. - We've all done dumb things. We've all done it. I mean, especially if you've been doing this for a long time, you're gonna make mistakes. So Tom, tell me, is there anything you wanna share before we wrap up 'cause I've taken a lot of your time? Any closing thoughts? Any advice to someone who's new in the industry? - Just get out there and learn. Don't be afraid to try things. There's, it's not as hard as you think. It all seems insurmountable. It looks like this huge task to learn all of this, to get into technology. I have a friend who's an amazing success story. I'm hoping to do an interview with him sometime. He went from, about eight years ago, working in the automotive industry. He's the same age as me too, by the way, he's in his forties. He worked in automotive, one day, he said, you know, I like tech, but I don't do much more than play video games. He's currently one of the, he's working on becoming a red teamer, but currently at a company, he's head of their sock at a very large company. He manages 178,000 endpoints. And that's an eight year path from, I work in automotive to that. So, it's and he's not he's, I'm not saying he's not exceptional. He's a smart guy, he's nice, he's pleasant. But there's nothing. He's not some savant who's just been doing this his whole life. He went from managing and putting parts in buckets, you know, automotive work to, I wanna learn computers, a few college courses. And we became friends 'cause he lives here locally. But he watched some of my YouTube videos and he says, you know, it's really helpful. He learned a lot of network engineering. It just really fascinated him. And it just became obsessive reading books, and a few courses, a few certifications. And he got a job at one place, another place, and he's got good personal skills by the way. If you asked him what his secret to his successes, he'll say I'm way more personal than the people I work with. Like I was able to engage with management and that always got me a promotion. - It's great advice. It's like, don't just focus on technical. You've said that a few times. Focus on other other things. What about networking? I mean, not like networking and per se like hardcore networking, but I mean, like LinkedIn and stuff like that. - Be social. Go on there, engage on Reddit. Reply to people's comments, ask questions, get involved in the community. If the opportunity's there, I'm really big. We ran a couple, I remember like how DevCon does the area code like DevCon 31. We ran DC through and three for a while. Pre-pandemic, we hold hacker events and we're like, everyone's invited, we're buying pizza and beer if you drink, it's all free. Come to these events. I don't care how much of a newb you are. You're not gonna be treated any different. We want everybody here. And that helped a lot because just don't, people are like this. Oh, I don't know. I, will I fit in with these people? Just come in and check it out. So, the in-person networking if possible is awesome. If not get in and engage with these communities, there's plenty of everywhere from Discord to that. Just start asking questions in very, I actually coached someone on how to ask a question recently. They said, they weren't getting responses by. I said, you know, I said, I think you're asking about the kind of hard drive you want, but you literally wrote three paragraphs. I said, people are very busy, but they're very happy to answer your questions if you can condense it down to a little bit more of basic. Even take your questions. That's how you do these small learning steps because no one wants to take the time to read through three paragraphs and go, what's wrong? And you gotta narrow it down. But this, it think about how you communicate with a person, start with, hey, how you doing? Be a little personal online, on LinkedIn and, you know, engage with these forums, engage with the posts and comment back and forth. You'll go a long ways. You make a lot of new friends that way. That's how I have all these friends that work for these big companies that I get to hang out with. And everyone loves to talk about what they do. So if you start with say, hey, what do you do? And you know, oh, I manage BGP for these large companies. Well, that's interesting. Tell me a story. And they're always excited to talk about their work things. Start with that conversation. If you hit people up for support, you're going to like, hey, I have this problem. Help me solve it. What, we just met on LinkedIn 30 seconds ago, I'm gonna direct you to some forums or something like. - You've hit it in the head there where it's like, don't just expect, give, you know, help someone else, contribute. Don't just demand. I'll put all your links below. - Thank you. - Really wanna thank you for, you know, for joining and spending your time with me. Really appreciate it, thanks. - Oh, absolutely, had a great time, appreciate it. (electronic music)",

    "transcript": "- This one's gonna be interesting. This video is sponsored by Nebula, is under the Anchor Umbrella. And it's about one of those portable projectors, but it's unlike any portable projector that I've ever seen before, because usually those things are kind of basic and this one is anything, but it is a 4K Laser Projector with Android TV built-in and obviously a focus on portability. In terms of hardware, it's got a Cortex-A55, quad core two gigs of RAM 16 gigs of storage. Here we go. Auto Keystone, auto screen detection. It'll apparently actually dim the lights if you accidentally walk in front of it, which is kind of important for a 2,400 lumen laser projector. - [Andy] Great if you have a kid. - Yeah, yeah, definitely beneficial if you have a kid. It's better not to blind your children, leave it to them to do that themselves when they're teenagers, if you know what I mean. If I had to guess, I'd say these allow to do all the smart things it does. So ambient light detection, auto positioning of the image and all that kind of cool stuff. Cooling fan right here. If you're gonna do 2,400 lumens laser, you're definitely gonna have a little bit of heat to deal with. It remains to be seen how quiet it is. There's a vent pull up and back up. Okay, here we go. And then we've got here. Maybe there's something in the accessory kit that will make sense. They're supposed to put like a little Chromecast thing in there or what? Oh, hello, Nebula 4K Streaming Dongle. So it does have Chromecast built-in and okay. This is really cool. I think this is the whole brain, which conceivably could mean that you could upgrade it. That's really cool. Is that a little cooling fan for this compartment? Totally is. Interesting. What an unusual way to do that. Kind of like it actually. Does it have on board speakers? Yes, it does. It's got two speakers apparently support for Dolby audio, auto focus. I guess all that remains now, is to try it. Actually, let's have a quick look at the remote first. So you've got all your main video services. Find video, YouTube, Netflix, Disney, they missing anything? I guess you see Hulu, Hulu buttons on some. - A Floatplane button. - Yeah, Floatplane button. Where's the Floatplane button Nebula by Anker? Where's the lttstore.com button where people can get really nice shirt like this one, or a dad hat like this one? The buttons on the top, other than the power button all seem to be touch sensitive. So all that remains now is to go try it out. BRB. Something I noticed about the Cosmos Laser 4K while I was coming up here was that it's hefty, but not heavy. Like you can, you can one hand it. And I really liked the grip on the bottom. It's nice and rounded. It's rubberized. It's not the kind of thing you'd wanna drop. So I guess that's a good thing for it to have. That's interesting. It's got what appears to be a quarter inch threaded mount on the bottom. So if you wanted to just put it on a little stand or something, you could do that. Let's plunk it down and theoretically, this should be about the distance we need cause it's got a 1.27 times a throw ratio. So we need to be about 27% farther from the screen than the diagonal of the image we're trying to get. Nebula says the Cosmos is good for anywhere from a 60 inch to 150 inch screen. So we are gonna be at the very limits of its capabilities here. Let's try that one more time. Maybe you hold to turn. Yes. Okay. You can correct the image or blah, blah, blah. Oh, one of those sensors on the front was IRR. So it's an IRR rather than an RF remote something to keep in mind, but they seem to have, yeah, they have sensors on both the front and the back, which makes life a little bit easier. Unfortunately, I won't be able to use the Nebula Connect App because this particular model isn't out yet. They are launching their Kickstarter when this video goes up and then they're gonna be shipping in March, 2022. To be clear, I don't consider this to be us promoting a Kickstarter product cause it's like Nebula by Anker. They're not exactly some nobody's. So I would be pretty darn confident that it's actually going to ship. One thing I would like to see is some way to kind of level it a little bit more easily. I feel like our table's not level, wait. I think it is. I think I just didn't have it centered before. We are definitely gonna have to reposition this couch a little bit though. Actually we can try out the eye dimming thing. Did it dim at all? - [Andy] Nope. - Oh. - [Andy] You're blind now. - I wonder if it actually needs to see your eyes. I don't wanna test it. I legitimately do not wish to have laser beam shown into my eyes. You know what? I don't feel like testing that. Hopefully they've got it sorted out. So we just need to prop it up a touch. In a perfect world, we wouldn't wanna use Keystone at all. Ideally, we'd be able to just get it up a little bit higher. You'd want it right about, here. Yeah, do we have something about the Store? That's pretty darn close. Why is this table so crooked? I think we're actually gonna call that good enough for a portable projector. Just push down that box a little bit. Oh, wow. That's actually-- - [Jono] Pretty good. - Not bad. We'll just use the standard audio profile. So it's actually got four separate drivers in it, are two full range and then two tutors. It's got Bluetooth connectivity. So you can use it as a Bluetooth speaker if you want. Wait, no. I don't wanna actually do that right now. Well, it can do that. There we go. Just press back and then it's all good. Open Plex. \"Sorry, it looks like XGIMIGon Give It To Ya isn't available right now.\" Where did that come from? And I'm supposed to trust Google Assistant to like book hair salon appointments for me. Can't even do basically. I was trying to call Yvonne yesterday. It Called Yvonne ho, \"Sorry, there's no number for Yvonne home, call Yvonne ho.\" And it's like Yvonne, something else entirely. \"Sorry, you don't have a contact name Yvonne\" Like call Yvonne. \"Calling Yvonne ho\". Like you'd think you'd look for maybe something that sounds close. No HDR support, unfortunately, but it's already really noticeable. The difference in contrast being on a laser projector. It's pretty cool. And Andy, unable to kill that light behind me? - [Andy] Sure, yeah. - Let's get to extract myself. Wow, look at that. It did warn me about being in front of it there. Not bad, right? - [Andy] Yeah, looks good up close. - Hey, Jono, did they mention if it supports HDR? - [Jono] HDR10. - It does support HDR? - [Jono] Yeah. - I said it didn't earlier and then I fired up how to train your dragon. I'm like, this looks like HDR. Good, I thought I was going crazy. (Jono laughs) Now it's Laser DLP. So if you are highly susceptible to the rainbow effect, then you might notice it. I do notice it a little bit, but I am highly susceptible to it. And it's as usual, only when you flick your eyes around on the screen. So during normal content consumption, it shouldn't be noticeable. But as I move back to look at you guys, I can see a little bit of rainbow effect. - [Jono] Oh yeah. - So personally I've never considered it to be a huge deal. Could I get that HTMI cable? You just moved my table, Jono. - [Jono] Sorry. (Jono laughs) - I had it just right. - [Jono] I'm sorry. - Man, this is really riding a fine line between, portable projector and like actually looking really good. - [Jono] Yeah. - Okay, let's try some games. - [Andy] Actually sounds good. - That actually sounds surprisingly usable. Man, the remastered graphics don't look that amazing until you toggle the original ones. You're like, oh right. Yeah, the nostalgia effect is strong with this one. I've never played this game with a controller really. So I have no idea how to, there we go. There's a weapon that doesn't suck. This is very different from the battery powered projector toys that we've looked at in the past. Oops. Oh, crap. (gunfire) Like this is an actual projector that just happens to be portable. It's pretty cool. (gunfire) It's got a one-year warranty. It's rated for 25,000 hours of light source life, which is freaking lot. And while it is going to be a pretty penny at around $2,200 MSRP. The Kickstarter is going to feature some hefty discounts. So we'll have that link down below.

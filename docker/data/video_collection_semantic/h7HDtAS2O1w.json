    "transcript": "- It is time yet again, my friends, for a large box of mysterious items from our friends at Sendico, all the way from Japan. As always, we have no sponsorship with Sendico, I just like 'em 'cause they let me buy all kinda weird Japanese stuff and make videos on 'em. Now, this one's gonna be a little different, because the items in this box have been purchased slowly but surely over the last six months. So how much did I pay just to ship this very substantial box all the way from Japan? - [Alex] You paid a little over $110 just to get that box shipped to us. - Now that sounds like a lot, but keep in mind that this came directly via FedEx from Japan, in two days, right? Sendico, they don't play when it comes to shipping. First... Ah man, I'm making a mess. All right, first up we've got our Neo-Geo CD! All right, hang on. I gotta clean this up. This is a bit of a mess here. So we've got the original manual, and the Pro-Gear Spec Advanced Entertainment System itself. So the Neo-Geo, this was a line of consoles that were largely, I would say, popular in the mid to early 90s. So with the Neo-Geo, we have the- - [Alex] Did it not come with cables? - (sighs) Look at this power adapter. What is this? What is that power adapter? It's like a little tiny, like, guy. I will say this is in really good shape. Unfortunately, until I find the power adapter, I don't think I can do anything with it. So maybe let's keep looking through the box. How do you feel about a video game to celebrate the wildly successful Ken Bolido production, Denki? - [Ken] Oh, tell me more. - \"Denki Blocks!\" A Game Boy Advance game that was designed to celebrate the Denki channel. - Oh, sick. What? Oh, oh, it's light. - Great catch. - Oh, it's in the box too? - Dude, we're talking Sendico here, man! Most of this stuff is very nice. I bought this just because it said Denki- - Yeah, I figured. - I actually don't know if it's a good game or not. Oh! Okay. There's something to play that in a minute. Apologies for this video being a little all over the place. I'm just pulling stuff out as we go. This, this is something that I think you're gonna be really excited for. You have not seen one of these in like 10 years. I guarantee it. The original Nvidia Shield! - [Ken] Oh my god. Wait... (chuckles) - I found it from Japan! Okay- - What the hell? - So here's the thing. This was the very first Nvidia Shield, running a Tegra processor. While it looks like a goofy little controller, if you open it up, it's a full-on Android portable gaming device. So this was the predecessor to things such as the Shield TV, and probably more specifically, is the predecessor to the Nintendo Switch, because this was very similar in hardware, just a few years older. So you can see on the back, \"Powered by Nvidia Tegra.\" Now, the reason I purchased this from Japan is because these are impossible to find now. I look on eBay on a regular basis. Every once in a while I find one of these things pop up, but just, Nvidia sold so few of them. But it was a really cool piece of tech because not only did it run Android, but this is when Nvidia really started leaning into it. And you know, one of the main selling points of this was game streaming. They were like, \"Hey, do you wanna stream games from your Nvidia GPU?\" All right, activate. Oh, well, the... Yes! Yes, we have life, \"Nvidia powered by Android.\" I forgot that the Nvidia logo actually lights up. That's adorable. All right, let's start out by opening up YouTube. Does YouTube work? \"A new version is available.\" Okay. \"Authentication needed to log in.\" Oh, it's broken. Damn, the Play Store doesn't work anymore. How much did I pay? - You paid $91. - Now that might sound like a lot of money for a old console that is borderline not functional anymore. But I am determined to get a version of some games on here from the period that they were running, and to actually used the Shield like it was intended. (wind whooshes) Aha! I found it! Hey Ken, you got that beautiful game of \"Denki Blocks!\" for Game Boy Advance. Well- - Okay. - You need a Game Boy to play it. I will tell you that if you are a Game Boy aficionado, never go on Sendico ever. It is the most dangerous place on the internet. Look at this and tell me this is not the most charming Game Boy you've ever seen, okay? So we're gonna start out by opening it up. So it came in this little, like, \"Ruby and Sapphire\"- - Oh, that's cute. - Little... Yeah. Game Boy, like, carrying Case, right? It's even got the little red in the blue Little case. You got Ash, you got Treecko. The whole thing. But then when you open it up, look what's inside. Look at this! Look at this Game Boy Advance! I'm pretty sure it was listed as junk, which to be fair, most Game Boys and things that are not in good shape, they list as junk, even though a lot of times they work. It works, it's on. - Hooray! - Now, the screen's a little burned in. But how much did I pay for this junk Game Boy Advance SP? - [Alex] You paid $63. - Okay, actually I thought it was a little less than that. Well, still though, this is cool, right? Now, if you look closely, the Game Boy's clearly in pretty thrashed condition, right? There's a lot of scratches and scrapes, like, it was not treated kindly. But all of these old-school Pokemon stickers are so freaking rad. And it does... Buttons seem to work. Actually here, you know what? Would you like to evaluate with a copy of \"Denki Blocks!\"? - I will. Oh yeah, you- - Isn't that cool? - Yeah. - I mean. it's definitely, like, beat up, right? - [Ken] I can't... Oh my god, I can't even read these characters. Uh-oh. - So I know we paid $60 for the Game Boy, how about for \"Denki Blocks!\" the game. - [Alex] The game \"Denki Blocks!\" We paid a little over $50. - [Austin] Did we really? - [Ken] I don't know what I'm doing right now. - I will say that- - Oh, I see. - [Alex] They did make an American version of this game. - What's it called? - \"Denki Blocks!\" (Alex chuckles) - You could- - I could have- - Have bought the American one? - Bro. - In fact, you can... They made an app for it. You can play it on Android and iOS. (laughs) - What? - Yo! - But you can't play it on this vintage 2003 Game Boy Advance SP now, can you? (wind whooshes) So this next item is something that I have absolutely no idea about, but I saw it and I could not resist. So these are speaker-headphones? The NWM Ones. But it was quite expensive, right? - [Alex] So, actually, these are kind of interesting because they just came out, these are a brand-new product in Japan. It costs $300 retail. And we bought it for like- - What is that? - Neo-Geo controller? (Alex laughs) I think what happened is Sendico repacked the box and put my controllers in with the headphones. - That's- - Good choice on that one. - [Alex] Hilarious. - We'll use these in a little bit. Ahem, sorry, go ahead, what were you saying? - [Alex] Okay, so we paid around 250, because technically these are used. The person who bought them tried 'em on, apparently, and then immediately went, \"Nope.\" - [Ken] I also like to point out that, like, the way you describe these- - Yeah. - Are just open-back headphones. - But wait until you see them because they're... I would not describe them as open-back. I would describe them as speakers near your ears. - [Ken] You don't want... You wanna feel like you're... Oh, okay. - Do you see what I'm talking about here? It is literally... This is the speaker, and then that's your ear over here, - [Ken] Bro, I kind of dig that. - It looks cool, that's... I mean, I saw it, I was like, \"What is this?\" So it has a very kind of, like, rough kind of texture. Almost like 3D printed. It's not, it's probably like recycled plastic or something. So when I put these on, it's unlike normal headphones, in that you really have to adjust the sort of the band very carefully, because if you can see, the speaker is directly, like, basically touching my ear, right? So this little, like, ear cup that goes around, it's just to hold it. The speaker itself is pretty much directly over my ear. Let's just listen to some music. I'm gonna listen, see if y'all can hear it. I'm gonna listen at normal volume and then I'll listen a little bit louder. Okay, I will say doing this versus this makes an enormous difference. It literally halves the volume from me. - [Ken] Dude, I cannot hear it from here at all. 0%. - You cannot? - 0%. - It's quite loud. Like, to the point where I can barely hear you right now. - No, no, no, like, I cannot hear it, period. - So my first impression is these don't sound good, but also it's a different kind of sound. Like, they're very warm, very, very bassy. Like... Almost like they're lacking a little bit of clarity. - Oh, whoa. - Weird, right? - There's a lot of bass to it. - It's very bassy- - Which is really impressive. So I- - I mean- - I actually do.. I mean, I tend to like warm more than you. These actually sound really good to me. - So we have some options for sound. Oh, so it's dynamic EQ. So, actually, let me just try without the dynamic EQ- - I mean- - Okay, so this is just... Switched to balance mode. So just totally regular. (playful chill music) No, no, that's not it. - Oh dude. - I feel like we're listening to different headphones right now. (Alex laughs) I'm not impressed. You seem like you're into this. - Bro. - These are weird. I can't... I can't get behind it. I can't get behind it. It's a style of sound signature that I think you really need to listen to before you commit to spending this kinda money. But, easily, the most unique headphones I've ever tried. And I don't hate them, but the audio's not there for me. It's just not, it's just not there for me. - Since you don't want them, I'll take them. (Alex chuckles) - I got you \"Denki Blocks!\" Isn't that enough for you? - This is more fun than \"Denki Blocks!\" (wind whooshes) - All right. I think these go together. So this came in a little bundle. So it actually comes with a Super Game Boy, which is nice. Behold, my friends, a truly unusual console. This... Is a custom Super Famicom. (Austin chuckles) I don't think I looked at the photos well enough. What is the... What the hell? This is really weird. Now, I think if I just press this switch, it will turn on, right? Now, there's another switch. There's no instruction manual, as you might be surprised to learn. The display is on. It's getting power, but no signal. I will say the case has been slightly damaged. So this little, like, peg, it's squished the top of the case in. Hopefully it didn't get damaged in shipping maybe. So I think, let me just plug this into another display and see if I can get it to work somehow. Oh, okay, I got 1080p but no signal. So let's try plugging into a CRT and see if that works. So, flip this on. Nothing. Yeah, oh wow. Oh, ooh, oh, oh. That's very complicated How much did we pay for our custom, brand-new Super Famicom weirdo edition? - [Alex] We paid $157. - If this worked, that'd be all right, because this is a very neat little project. I'll be honest with you, this is beyond my knowledge to fix. I think it's been damaged. 'Cause they clearly showed it working completely fine on the listing. I don't know what else could have happened, right? At the very least, this internal display should work. I'm just plugging it into a standard USB-C, it's getting power. I see all the LEDs lighting up, but it just... It's not actually coming to life. Kind disappointed, not gonna lie. But it is a neat idea, if I could find some way of fixing it somehow. (wind whooshes) I accidentally bought more Pokemon cards from Sendico! Well, since it's here we might as well open some, right? I mean, it's.... Otherwise it'd be wasteful, right? So Ken already left, didn't he? He literally saw Pokemon cards and just disappeared. Okay, goodbye Ken. We'll open Pokemon cards without you, buddy. Anyone wanna open some packs? (crickets chirping) Packs? - Yay! - Woo! As you can see, we've got a bountiful harvest of pulls that I'm now going to add, using the Rare Candy card scanner. - [Alex] Oh. - I am now officially an investor in Rare Candy. See- - Is this- - It was a secret promotion the entire time. Boy, oh boy, do I love the Rare Candy card scanner. Makes it so easy. Look at that guy. Boom, scanned. And we have... What's our Jigglypuff worth? Our Jigglypuff is worth $1. Oh. Well. Well, I asked the question, why not? Download the Rare Candy app today! (bell rings) (wind whooshes) Next up we have a little tiny guy that I did not know existed. So this is a Game Gear Micro. So if you're unfamiliar, the Game Gear was a competitor for the Game Boy. So, Sega made this in the early 90s, I think. It's like '91 or something. It's something like that. Isn't that just a little guy? With micro USB. - [Alex] (laughs) Yeah. - And it's too small. I'm just gonna (indistinct)... It is too small. But the screen's pretty good. The quality of everything is pretty decent. The speaker sounds good. My bigger problem is just the D-pad is a little bit on the squishy side. Like, it doesn't feel like it's very, like, sort of even. And considering that the games that are preloaded on this are very much text-heavy RPG-style games, a little hard to read any of it. Yeah. How much did I pay for this complete in-box copy of the Game Gear Micro? - [Alex] We paid $93. - That's too much money. (Alex laughs) That was a questionable decision. This feels like it should be 30 bucks. (wind whooshes) All right, this next item... Huh, if I recall correctly, was a little bit on the expensive side, because this, my friends, is not your ordinary Sega Saturn. Oh no. This is before companies were very kind of particular about their brands. This is still when you could have, like, a lot of weirdos, a lot of unique sort of things. And for companies who weren't making their own consoles, such as Victor, they were just going to license essentially the design of the Saturn. So this is the V-Saturn, which is a multi-amusement player, the RG-JX1. The problem with the Saturn was that it was so complicated that developers never really took advantage of it. It had dual CPUs in 1995, which was a little bit of an outrageous idea. And the concept of the Saturn is that you were able to play, essentially, like, arcade quality games at home, including titles such as \"Daytona USA.\" Unfortunately, because it was so hard to work with, and dual CPUs were not common, a lot of games just didn't use the second one. Okay, oh! It's actually very clean, wow. Okay. Yeah, this looks like it was really well taken care of. Or no one played the V-Saturn. This is shockingly clean. Like, honestly, if you told me that this was, like, a brand-new console, I would believe you. As with all old Japanese consoles, you're always playing a little bit of a rolling the dice to find out how it's gonna work with a TV, versus if I need to use, like, an adapter or something. But this is probably gonna just work outta the box, I think. Ready? And... Oh, yeah, boy, let's go. Let's go! Activate, V-Saturn. I should probably plug a controller in. Hell yeah. Wow, look at those 3D graphics. V-Saturn. All right, let me open up and put \"Daytona USA\" inside. I forgot that the old-school Saturn games, you could just play all the music from the game. Yeah, let's go! (upbeat cool music) Daytona - I'll say the Japanese version of \"Daytona USA\" music is way better. (Alex z chuckles) It's just so much better. So the Saturn version of \"Daytona USA,\" while not quite on par with what you had in the arcade, was really quite good for its era. Like, this was very competitive with some of, like, the early PlayStation games. It's smooth. You see the draw distance isn't amazing, but this is a good version of the game. You ain't for sure... Ah! Ah! Ah! - [Alex] Ow. Gotta warn headphone users before you do that. - Sorry. - You placed 29th. (Alex laughs) - [Joanna] Dope. - Look, this V-Saturn is dope. Now, I gotta ask, how much did we pay for the V-Saturn? - [Alex] I mean, I know that you forgot how much we paid. - I definitely forgot. It was a lot though. - [Alex] Now that you have experienced the full, complete inbox-ness, how much did you think it's worth? - I think 300,000 yen. Or like 200 bucks. - You got very close. - Did I? - [Alex] It cost us $230. - $230? Okay. It might not be for everybody, but this is so neat. Like, I just love this kinda stuff that you're able to find on Sendico, that you're able to find through Japanese sellers who have actually kept things in beautiful conditions. So hopefully we can continue to preserve this stuff for many years in the future. (wind whooshes) Oh, there's our power adapter. - Are they done? Okay. - Yes, Ken, there are no more Pokemon cards. It's safe. - When Sendico stuff happens in the company, we have one account. And if I know I'm gonna want to do a Sendico video, I start hoarding all of the items so that you can pay for the shipping. - Great. - Do you know what this is? - I do not know what that is. Oh, is it the boombox? - Oh, it's a boombox! - You got the boom... Okay. I like how you're surprised, even though you're the one who sent me the boombox. I think you sent this to me like six months ago, so I'm sure you forgot about it. - I totally forgot I ordered a boombox. - Oh my god. - Oh, it is such- - Dude! - In pristine condition! - It's got the whole thing! - Yo! (laughs) - Oh my God. - Look at that- - Brother. - Brother. - Brother, that is so cool. So wait, so gimme the story here. So you just found... So this is a Sony boombox from, I would say, what? Late 70s, early 80s? - 1980. - 1980. - And apparently this is a Mark II. (boombox hisses) - It works! - [Radio] Whatever you want- - That's actually a really clean signal. - Yeah. We can increase and decrease the bass. (upbeat music) Ooh! - [Radio] Southern California, a big challenge for first responders. - That sounds phenomenal. (calm drum music) (bright string music) This is phenomenal. Should we try a cassette? - Yes, so- - I don't know how to get the cassette to work, but we're... Let's give it a try. (Japanese pop music) - I'm holding it down. - It sounds really bad. - Yeah, I mean, it was recorded scuffed. That's the goal. Oh wait, no, yeah, it's not holding. - Wait, you could just use this as a stereo. - Yeah, it because it has- - Has a line in. - Line in. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - And you leave it plugged in, and just get that warm 1980 Sony sound. How much did we pay for this? - Well, Ken paid- - Ken? - Wait, no- - I paid for it. - [Alex] Okay, sure. - Ken made me pay... - [Alex] $212. - [Ken] I mean- - No. - Yeah. - No, what- - Yeah. Yeah, that's about right. I mean, clean, these things are like 300 bucks. - [Joanna] Go stand in the corner and hold it up for the movie reference. (chill music) - You're up. - Romeo, Romeo. Where art thou, Romeo? - Okay, so after acquiring the power adapter, and importantly, a game, for our Neo-Geo CD, this is \"The King of Fighters 98.\" Let's actually just see if the Neo-Geo fires up. Because I didn't have a power adapter last time. I will say I have it plugged in and the red light is on. So let me... Lemme give this a try. (cool upbeat music) - [Ken] Ooh! - That's cool! Just in case you forgot, this is the Neo-Geo, but the CD version! Let's pop in \"The King of Fighters.\" I am really happy with this, from a hardware perspective. I'm gonna be this dude. He looks good. Oh wow, the loading times are slow though, man. You know, that was the downside, right? CDs were cool 'cause the capacity was enormous. They were fairly cheap to build, compared to cartridges. But the downside is the load times are... Yikes. Okay. I actually like the aesthetic. It's definitely, like, very... It's 2D, right? So this is not going to be... At least this game is not going to be really heavily focused on 3D, but it looks really delightful. Like, look at how much detail there is in, like, the backgrounds and stuff. I love the way this controller sounds and feels. The mechanism of this stick is phenomenally good. Like, it has so much travel to it, it's really clear every sort of way that you can kinda click it. You get that sort of, not only tactile feedback, but also a little audible feedback as well. (controller clicking) That just feels so good. Clearly this Neo-Geo works, and now that I have a game for it and whatnot, I'm feeling good. How much did we pay for our Neo-Geo CD? - [Alex] It cost 214 US dollars. - It's obscure, it's weird. It's not something that I think you're probably gonna wanna spend a ton of time playing. It was very, very unpopular. But it is definitely a piece of history and I'm really happy with how solid the condition really is. I gotta say, man, thumbs up, as always. We got some really cool stuff this time. But if you'd like to see more, definitely make sure to check out some of our previous Sendico videos here. If you'll excuse me, my friends, I'm going to go convince every game console manufacturer in history to incorporate this in their controllers. 'Cause good Lord, is that nice. (controller clicking) Hmm.",

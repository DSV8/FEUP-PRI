    "description": "So it sounds like Adcom (company featured in this video) may sue the company manufacturing the 4 dollar version.  If you visit the website for the Freedom 251 you'll see an exact replica listed at a far lower price. I'm not sure they'll ever be able to deliver at that price, others are skeptical as well. Starting to sound like a bunch of these went out the side door at the Adcom factory.  More info on the $4 Android phone...

    "transcript": "- Yes. That's where it is. Jack, did you do it? How deep was it? What's up guys, Lew here, back with another video. Today, I've got something I'm very excited for, And I know you are very excited for too, because this is probably the most, the single most requested item in Unboxed Therapy history. This is the four dollar smartphone. Android smartphone, it's running android, it has a touch screen, it's four dollars. Alright? Let that sink in for a minute. When this thing got announced, I had my Twitter blowing up, it's probably still blowing up. People are saying \"Lew get the four dollar phone! \"We wanna see the four dollar phone, \"is it real? Is it fake? \"Does it exist?\" This four dollar phone situation is a little bit complicated because it turns out, that the group selling the four dollar phone was actually just rebranding a phone from somebody else and in some cases, reportedly, using Wite-Out to switch the brand name. Are you kidding me? This is the original. This is, the knock off, that got knocked off. Anyways, these things are fresh in from India, and we're about to find out what the hell a four dollar phone does. I have two of them, maybe win of these, I guess I'll give one away, I don't know. Twitter, follow me on Twitter, I'll let you know more there. ADCOM, more than expect. Not expected. Expect. And it starts with an X. Do not accept it. The rest of the sticker is covered. I assume it says \"if it's damaged\" or something. Well, anyhow. Advantage Computers India, Kirti Nagar Industrial Area, New Delhi. Well done. Runs Android 5.1 Lollipop. Four inch touchscreen , gig of ram, five megapixel rear camera. It all seems too good to be true. Dual SIM card slot. Alright, enough about the box. Let's do the damn thing. Oh, I don't even know how you get a box, like a box like this on its own for four dollars. Here is the phone. OK, I mean it kind of feels like a toy. It kind of feels like a small iPhone sort of? One thing I kind of like right now is the texture on the back of the device. Let's see if it has any battery life. Or is the battery even inside of it, hold-up. You probably have to install it. You do, ships with no battery inside. Look at this! Extra screen protector. Some headphones, micro USB. European power brick. How about the accessories. So the battery, not huge. 1500 milliamp hours. There we go, OK. The dual SIM card trays. Now you're probably wondering, why would there be dual SIM card trays? I'm not complaining about it, but in certain places, typically emerging markets this is a feature that's in high demand for various reasons. You can actually keep two phone numbers in here, so that's a feature we don't even see on a lot of premium phones. Also, microSD card slot for storage expansion. Pretty surprising. (gentle music) That was abrupt. So, I'm guessing this is not a fingerprint scanner down here, I think this is a pen mark. Like somebody drew with pen on the inside of there. Look at that! Fairly quick. It's got a bit of an iOS type of vibe, skin to it. The browser looks like a Safari logo. The touchscreen, it's got this weird vibe where it's recessed quite a bit from the actual surface. Therapy, good. Wow, you know what, pretty snappy? Dare I say, for something that is the cost of a toy. - [Lew] Did I switch to the creaky chair? What's up guys, Lew here back with another video - I mean I heard probably worse speakers on phones that cost one hundred times more than this. If it's true, if you can find this thing for four dollars, I just don't understand how you can compare it to what else is out there because, I mean you could drop this thing in a lake and not even be bothered. I mean, you pay more for your lunch. But, could I ask for more? I don't know. It's not a Galaxy S7 screen, that's for damn sure. But it's getting the job done, I'm watching Unboxed Therapy right now. This is where things are going to get a little sketchy though, in the camera. Probably I'll say once again, better than I expected. So that looks more like a painting than a photograph. I know it's more complicated, because you got this wacko, re-branding, Wite-Out on the name ADCOM for the company that's selling this exact phone for four dollars. So, who knows what kind of sketchy business is going on. I mean I'm not saying that there is, but I'm not saying that there's not. How they're able to actually offer something like this for four dollars, because Jack can't even have a good time for four dollars. Trust me, he's tried. I gotta say, if you need a phone and you're short for cash, I'm going to recommend it. Go get yourself a four dollar phone. It's amazing, you're on your phone and you're shooting 4K. I remember when 4K was just a dream, and I used to read, word up magazine.",

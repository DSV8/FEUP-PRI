    "transcript": "[Phone ringing] -Hello? -[Insurance agent] Hello. We've been trying to reach you regarding your vehicle's extended warranty. -[Zack] I'm like 72% sure I'm beyond the warranty at this point. -[Insurance agent] We've been offering this warranty to everyone. -You want to insure a war-zone military Humvee that's been converted to an electric vehicle in some guy's garage? -Sir? -I mean it's like a tank and a Prius had a baby and the delivery doctor was Frankenstein . -Sir. -And there's like a non-zero chance that the electric torque will snap off all four tires the first time I floor it. Does that really sound like an insurable situation? [Insurance agent hangs up] Let's get started. [Intro] So in the last video about building the 12 volt system where we built the brains of this whole operation, it was brought to my attention that I need to add fuses before my relays. For some reason I was thinking that the relay would act as the fuse. Turns out that's not the case. This is a normal sized fuse and this is the fuse that we need in front of the relays. I mean everything probably would have been fine, but if something ever went wrong, if something shorted out, my passengers would have gotten really toasty really quick and the fuse solves that problem. Better to be safe than sorry. So I will be adding these big old fuses in front of the relays before I start actually wiring them up to the heavy duty components. In today's video, now that the control panel is finished, we'll be wiring up all of the exterior lights, like the blinkers and the headlights, and a few of the 12 volt components. One thing that's a little bit different between my military Humvee and a regular car on the road is that the military humvees have a 24 volt system, which is why we have to swap pretty much everything out for 12 volt components. The problem with the previous system being 24 volts is that if I switch to a 12 volt system now, these lights are going to require twice as many amps to run, which means they have to run thicker wires to everything. Luckily I think I can switch out these bulbs and the headlights with LEDs that are already preconfigured to run with 12 volts because it's way more common in regular civilian vehicles these days. And so that's an easy way around that problem. And this is the 12 volt LED. As far as the internal wiring goes, I got a little snip happy with all the wiring harnesses. So we can see right up in here is where I snipped all of the wires that go towards the tail lights. So one of these is the reverse, one of them is the brake line, one of them is the blinker, and I have to figure all of that out. And I'm not sure if you can see this, but these are 14 gauge wires which should work with my LED 12 volt system. I can just use the same copper wiring. So now, if I take my 12 volt jumper and I bring it over and attach it to the rear tail lights, we should have illumination. The problem though, which I didn't realize before is that I thought this had reverse lights. It turns out the military humvees do not have reverse lights, only on the ambulance versions. These lights down here are actually blackout lights. So the humvees can drive around at night and not be seen by anybody else except for, you know, people wearing night vision. In order to speed things up I'm probably just going to have to order lights that would fit in each one...LED lights...and then put them on the military Humvee So it's going to take a couple days for those to arrive, but for you guys... they are already here. The power of editing. What's nice about these H1 lights is that they are already 12 volt and already LED. So we're saving power and it's the right voltage for this vehicle that we're creating, even though they were a bit more expensive. So what we need to do now is pop these rivets off, pop off the old housing, put the new housing in, which should fit pretty good. And then we can wire up the tail lights. Taking out the taillights is easy enough, there's just a series of rivets surrounding the outside edge of the light fixture. Once those are drilled out the fixture can be removed and I can take the new fixture and put it into place. What's cool about this new fixture going into place is that the rivet hole locations are in the exact same spot as the original Humvee And rivets are actually pretty cool. So this is a rivet gun, we're going to pop the rivet into the gun and press it down like this. Then when it goes into the piece of metal, this part's going to expand. Watch as I crank this. Then the tip breaks off and we're left with a rivet holding two pieces of material together. We're only doing two rivets right now because eventually I want to paint this thing and it's easier to drill out two than, you know, all 8 or so. Not too shabby. And now we have reverse lights in a 12 volt system. There are good things and bad things about working on a project this size. One, there's lots of room for stuff so I don't have to cram things in, but two, it's very difficult to move things around. So I'm going to be mounting the headlights and the blinkers while the hood is tilted up against the garage. This thing is massive, but lucky for us AM General has labeled each of these wires individually with little numbers. Like if we go over here to this low beam we can see that it's labeled 18C. And we can trace that wire all the way over here to this low beam, and down here to this connector, which I'm going to reuse when I put it all back together. I'll just splice the ends of the wires that I need onto the bottom of this harness. You can buy large plugs like this, so I mean, if it gets too dirty or doesn't work I'll just do that. But here it's already wired up so I'm just going to use the wires that already exist. Now that the turn signals are installed, the only real changes we have to do to the wiring is just installing these little single plug connectors, which apparently are pretty universal. I just got a bag of these same connectors on Amazon. So I'm going to snip off the old connectors, which we don't need anymore now that I've wired up each of these cables. And then I can put these plugs on the end of the wires, and we should be good to go. Now that should be a waterproof connection...water resistant connection...for the parking lights. So initially I planned on using these headlights. I kind of like the look of them. But when I tried to put them into the housing, they didn't quite fit. And so instead of doing a bunch of expensive modifications that would take a long time to the headlights, I decided to go this route. Now both of these are jeep headlights. Just a 7 inch round headlight. And this one fits perfectly. An easy way to tell how many amps one of the components is using in your circuit is with a voltmeter. I have this hooked up to the fused output and I'm completing the circuit with the voltmeter. So if I connect here to the high beams, it says we are using 3 and amps. If I connect here to the low beams, we are using 2 amps which is incredibly low. And if I connect here to the running lights, we are only using, wow, .06. That's pretty impressive. LED has a lot less draw on the system than we would if we were running regular bulbs. And these are still extremely bright. Now I will have to pull the old connectors off of the old headlights, chop this off and then splice them in because these were built for a jeep. But then I can use the same plugs on my hood for this setup. The only issue with the new headlights is that they have something called a daytime running light which needs another wire that we don't have access to. So I'm going to take this little rubber grommet and make my own little access hole and the rubber grommet helps keep water out as well as keeps the wire from rubbing up against the metal sides and cutting itself. Now we have a nice little hole to pass a wire through. I'll clean up the rust and stuff inside of this housing probably a little bit later once I know the hummer works, cuz we got a long way to go. Then I can take the parking light wire, run it through, and I'll probably just tap into the side marker light so they can turn on at the same time. So I've never actually used t-tap connectors before but it seems like they'd fit pretty well with this situation where we need to tap into one of the other wires to get power. We know that the side markers are going to be turning on, or the running lights, and we want the running lights from the headlight to turn on with it. So if we crimp the spade connector onto the white wire and use the t-tap connector to bite into the wire from the side marker, it will be able to grab that power any time I flip the switch inside of the hummer. We'll have to see how they hold up over time. Got everything wired up using the existing harness, added both of the driver's running lights to the headlights and now it's time to see if they work. Alright, this one is going to be the right front turn signal. This one is going to be the left front turn signal. Parking lights which should trigger both the little guys inside of the headlights. The low beams..hoping I wired those up correctly. And finally, the high beams Yeah. That's a lot of light. Making progress. We're trying to use as much of the old wiring that we can. I left quite a bit of wires running from the taillights up to the front because it makes the project a little easier. And luckily there's wire diagrams online that tells us which wire is which and which wire goes where. So the blinkers took a minute for us to figure out. Remember that the original Humvee is a 24 volt system, and this is the solid state flasher that causes the signals to blink. And obviously we can't use a 24 volt flasher with a 12 volt system which is what we're putting in right now. So we had to get one of these. And something specific to LED lights because they draw so little power. So this right here is a little flasher relay. So if we take one of the blinker LEDs, as you can see if I connect it to a 12 volt power source it will just turn on consistently and stay on. But if I connect that same contact to this flasher relay, just like this, it'll blink just like a blinker should. So now I just have to mount this underneath the dash and I'll be able to wire up the blinkers. This is what causes it to blink. But what I'm hoping is that I'll be able to use this same signal stalk that's attached to the steering wheel for the blinkers and rear taillights and stuff. We have all the wires down here labeled, and these two are going to the flasher which we just talked about, which I've mounted up underneath the dash where the previous flasher used to be. And, of course, I'll need a key for my rig. The original humvees just come with a little flip switch that goes from the engine stalk to the run position. While you wait for the glow plugs to heat up, then you flip it to the start where it engages the starter and starts the vehicle. There's no key needed with the military humvees. Seems a little sketchy, but I guess when all the passengers are carrying M16's, there's not a whole lot to worry about. As I'm building my civilian H1 though, I'm not going to be carrying an M16, in which case I'll need a key. I'll need to drill a slightly bigger hole and then slide the ignition into place. Then I can go from the off position to the run position and start all my accessories. I have that special relay that engages half of the fuse panel when it's flipped into the run position. All a key really is is just a switch going from the off position to the on position. I don't need these light switches anymore either, so I'll just pop those out. I plan on putting a big stainless plate here with switches for my lights and other accessories, but we'll get to that later. Now if you listen very closely, every time I turn this key, the relay underneath the passenger seat will turn on. So before I wire up all these wires to the dash, we're going to start with something a little easier, which is the horn. Now I can't use the existing horn which is sitting here underneath the inverter because it's a 24 volt horn and it doesn't sound that great on a 12 volt system. Sounds like one of those old school telephones...not quite what we're going for. Now I have two horns to choose from here. We have a 330 hertz which is this guy...should be loud. [Honking sounds] Whoa, okay! A little better than the last one. Dang, that was loud. Then we have this guy. This is 400 hertz. [Honking sounds] I think I like the lower one. Let's go with the lower. There's the old horn. Before we can install the horn I need to figure out how much power it can actually draw when it's being pressed. That way we know what size fuse to use later. [Honking sounds] Four amps... and a headache. I'll explain fuses in a second. The old horn was mounted right here. The new horn I stuck right inside of this cavity on this bracket so it's facing straight down just like the old horn did. Now I need to route some wires to the battery and the horn switch. So the way I can check and make sure I have the right wire for this horn is by taking my power probe, sticking it on the wire I think it is, and pressing the horn. [Beeping sounds] Now I don't think this is the best switch in the world, probably because this is a 1995 and it's super old, but at least we found it. Basically, since we know the horn is going to pull 4 amps, we put the 10 amp fuse to let the electricity flow through it, but if it ever exceeds 10 amps, the fuse will break and cut the circuit. With the hummer on run and turned on, we should have horns. [Honking sounds] So now it's time to wire up the headlights and things are going to get a little bit confusing. I have some of these switches right here which are just little push button switches, and there are 5 wires coming out of the back. Now remember this is my first time doing this and we're going to learn together on this one. The switch has a couple different options, we have these blue wires which are normally open, and these yellow wires which are normally closed NO and NC. The black and red wires are just to light up the LED ring that's in the top of the switch. And it makes a pretty cool little blue glow which I really like. I'm going to show you really quickly. Just like that. And I can make that glow happen with however I want to wire up the switch, whether it's normally open or normally closed. For example, right now I have these two blue wires, which are normally open, wired up to this side marker light. And so since it's normally open, that means there's a break in the circuit meaning that when I connect this to the negative and positive on the battery, it won't turn on. I double checked to make sure. But, when I click the button, now the circuit is closed and this should turn on. Perfect. So I'm going to switch it to the yellow wires and it should be the exact opposite. It doesn't matter which one of these is negative or which one is positive because it's just a switch. So now the yellow is normally closed, so when the switch is flush and not pressed in, that means my switch should turn on. And then when I close it the light does not work. Science. These are a 10 amp switch, and since my headlights are never going to exceed, like, 4 amps, we're just fine using them. [Cutting sounds] Now obviously this is just a template, but it'll be a good place holder and a good spot to test out our buttons and make sure everything works before we laser cut the final version. [Cutting sounds] It's supposed to be right here. Bummer. [Cutting sounds] Now, we should be good to go. Now we're talking. We're leaving it. Oh wow. That covers up our mistake nicely. No complaints. So this is just a placeholder for the final version. When I made this template I wanted it to match the curves along the side, as well as sit about a centimeter inside of this so there's a little bit of a bezel all the way around. I put this hole in the wrong spot. Measure twice, cut once. But now, this gives me a little bit of a place to put my light buttons to kind of see where things are going to work. And then when I know how many switches I'm actually going to need, like for the windshield wipers and stuff, I can plan out the final version and laser cut it in stainless steel so it matches everything else. So this is a step bit and hopefully it'll get the holes drilled for the buttons so we can get the headlights working. [Drilling sounds] First one in. Remember, anytime I say anything at all in any of these videos, it's me learning it for the first time and explaining what I did and hoping for the best. So what we have here is three switches. These are just going to be the daytime running lights so you can ignore these for a minute. This one, though, is going to be the regular headlights, and when I press it, you would think that this is going to turn on the headlights but it's not. The headlights are connected to this switch on the normally open wires which are the yellow ones. So the headlight goes into this switch, sends power to this switch, and goes out to the regular headlights with this yellow wire here. Now if I want to turn on the brights, remember the headlights are on right now going through this switch, I'll press this and that turns off the regular headlights and on for the brights, which is running through this pair of wires right here the blue and red. And the grounds are all connected back here, three to a group just running to a bolt in the frame because the frame is grounded. Hopefully it works. Getting a little complex with the wires there for a second. But luckily, when I took off the old hood I had one of the old plugs, which is this guy right here, all prelabeled next to the plug. And this plug can come over here, installed in the frame, just kind of screws in with those 4 screws. And I'll be able to run the headlights and driving lights and everything right there underneath the dashboard. So for all of these wires there's only one ground wire, so I'm going to wire that up first. Having only one ground wire makes things convenient. Less wires running around underneath the hood. And since all the front lights are now LEDs, there's hardly any power consumption anyway. Okay, so we've got the low beams and high beams, along with the ground wired up. This might look like a rat's nest right now, but I will put some cable shielding on it before we actually go anywhere. One time I was holding my heat gun a little too close to this thing of heat shrink tubing and now a bunch of these are unusable. Woo! There she is! And the headlights work. So right now we should be able to get the parking lights going. Then we have the regular lights, and the brights. Yes. That worked out very well. So as far as connecting the rear driving lights, you know, the ones that turn on while we're driving but aren't essential to driving, I'm hoping that the electrical circuit kind of acts like a garden hose because I have one loop running up to the front end of the car and one loop running to the back end of the car. And with the garden hose you can connect as many sprinkler heads as you want and the electricity, or the water, would flow evenly to each of those sprinkler heads. In this case we're installing LEDs and the electricity should flow evenly to all the LEDs even though they are two different loops attached to the same button. There are two ways to find out if this would work or not. One is researching, and two is just doing it. The old rear side marker lights had rivets holding them in place. I've removed those and installed new housing. And with everything wired up using the old wires that held the previous lights, we can see if everything turns on at the same time. So we already know that we have the daylight running lights headed out to the front of the vehicle, which is going to be this wire here. And we need to tap into this wire to go to the rear of the vehicle for the lights back there. And I'm going to do that with something like this. This is one of the splices from the factory. You can see a wire back here, a wire going out, and then a big junction right here where the two wires meet. Except I'm going to do that with one of the soldered joints that will shrink down once I heat it up, as well as a piece of heat shrink over the top of that as well. I don't know if you can see that really well but the solder is now dripping into the copper and holding everything there. And now that it's cooled down a little bit, I can slide this over top and better secure the whole thing. And now the daylight running lights can come down this black wire, divvy out into two wires headed towards the rear of the car, as well as headed towards the front. And that glue in there with both the heat shrink connections and the solder I think is going to be more than enough to hold it. With the key on and the daylight running lights engaged, we should have power to these back lights, and we do. Done. And by done I mean we have a long way to go. Finally, it's time to upgrade the dash metal from this flimsy piece of tin that I have now to a laser cut piece of stainless steel. I just printed out a small design made from Fusion 360 to see if it would fit. And it's going to sit right about here with all the holes cut out for the buttons I need, and of course, the keyhole. This is what it looks like with all the dials and switches taken out. This is kind of what I made temporarily. Eventually we're going to have to take out the speedometer and all of these other gauges over here, but we'll do that during the high voltage video. I think we are off to a good start. The reason I chose to laser cut my dashboard and the shifter and a few other stainless parts is because the laser machine can do in seconds what would take me days to cut out by hand. All I have to do is take my design, upload it to OSH Cut's website and they can have the parts to me the next day. Once again this video is not sponsored, I just think this laser is super awesome. Plus the machine is local to me so I get to come see it in action. All of my parts have been laser cut out of 3 or 4 stainless steel. You know, the same material that Cybertruck's being made from. Laser cut some new stainless steel plates to replace these kind of rusted out guys. Look at these bolts compared to the new hardware. All held in place by these guys, which are actually called u-style clip on nuts. They just clip over the fiberglass and give something strong for the bolt to screw into. There we go. Now the backside of the headlight wiring has the same stainless steel accents as the rest of the vehicle. Moment of truth. Time to see if it fits. Very nice. There we have it. The dashboard is installed with our running lights, lights, and brights. I have these three buttons installed but they're not attached to anything quite yet. They are currently laser etched with turret, cloaking, and eject. Realistically. I'll probably wire the turret and the cloaking up to something, you know, normal like a light bar. But if you're ever on a ride with me just keep in mind that the eject button might be real. The laser cut piece of metal is quite a bit better than the piece of metal I tried to make myself. I think that's it for the 12 volt system. We learned quite a lot about the 12 volt battery, the lights and how, like, the brains of the operation work, along with some pretty cool laser cut components that help everything function. There are a few more things that I have to do to get it street legal, like the windshield wiper motor and a blower for the windshield in cold weather. But for the most part, the 12 volt system is pretty much done. I am filming several videos about this project simultaneously. So if you notice that in some of the other videos that the dashboard isn't in place yet, that's why. I think in the next video we'll work on the power steering and the power brakes since both of those are pretty vital to the function of the vehicle. And maybe after that we'll see if we can get the motor spinning. If you have any questions make sure to leave them down in the comments. Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.",

    "transcript": "so this is the Western Digital p50 game drive now you might be thinking to yourselves Eber what's so special about this drive well it's one of the first external SSDs to incorporate USB 3.2 gen 2x2 and I know that might confuse a lot of people but it's simply the fastest USB interface that's available in the market right now but before you go out and get one of these new drives there are a few things that you need to know about because since it is using a new interface we did run into a few issues that are certainly a bit concerning so let's talk about those and of course talk about the drive itself right after quick message for our sponsor the Razer DeathAdder v2 the gaming icon that just got upgraded with a lighter body negligence sensor and optical switches from maximum reliability and speed the classic economic shape handles like no other find out why 10 million other users love the Death Adder down below alright so let's talk about that USB 3.2 gen 2x2 interface at 20 gigabits per second I repeat 20 gigabits per second it's double the speed compared to a standard USB 3.0 gen 2 which is rated at 10 gigabits per second now naturally with every new USB interface is geared to be backwards compatible so if you are running a system with a 10 K bits per second port or a 5 gamers per second port this Drive should work just fine right now there are a few AMD TX 40 motherboards that support USB 3.0 gen 2x2 interface as well as a few x29 a motherboards but unfortunately notebooks are completely are the equations so if your main primary machine is a laptop well you are most likely not gonna have a 2x2 port because it's it's such a brand-new interface gigabyte has also announced an add-in card so from a speed perspective why would you want something like a 3.2 gen 2x2 at 20 gigabits per second instead of Thunderbolt 3 which gives twice as much as bandwidth first of all Thunderbolt is owned by Intel so what do you know AMD boards certainly take a lot longer to get certified with Thunderbolt 3 which is why we only have a few Indy motherboards floating in the market with that certification also Thunderball three drives are just ridiculously expensive I mean it just it's not even funny compared to a standard USB external drive so with that out of the way let's quickly talk about the Western Digital p50 so from the outside it looks amazing I mean I love this matte black finish but unfortunately it does show fingerprints I also really like the font choice engraved at the top it really suits the design it's also super durable as it comes with the shock resistance certification all in all this is one of the best if not the best looking external drives that I've ever seen what do you guys think Western Digital is targeting the p50 and gamers and that makes sense because with modern titles like Red Dead Redemption 2 it can easily eat up a hundred and twenty gigabytes on your local disk so it's better to have something like that on an external storage solution because you can use it on multiple computers and ideally this is exactly what we were looking for especially here in the office because when we're doing benchmarking it's easier for us to have our game libraries on an external drive without having to redownload all the files again for console gamers the p50 is both Xbox one and ps4 certified but all of this does come at a cost as you can see compared to some of the other gentle drives available market you are paying a little bit more but it's nor closer to the accountable three tax that's involved in some of the other drives that are available in the market alright so I think it's time to talk about some of the issues that we encountered on the p50 game drive from Western Digital we encountered some of these problems as we were using it on a regular basis so I'm gonna invite Mike over to talk about some of these issues in three two one this you oh yes you you clap - that afraid you gotta move I got a more dammit no you're taking over the frame alright so what are some of the issues that we experienced with the p50 what's yeah so for me this is probably one of my most frustrating experiences benchmarking a long long time the main reason for that is the problems that we found were so randomized but they only came up when we were using it in its native 20 gigabits per second well that's true yeah now one of the things that I noticed was that there was transfer errors on random files for example some video files transferred totally okay while others they went almost to 100% and then we started airing out on the drive another thing that we noticed is the steam library folder that we wanted to transfer to the drive it never got past like 10% it kept on airing out at the same time every single time but when we finally got that steam library to transfer over the 10 gigabit per second port mind you some games just refused to load so sieve and Warhammer they just aired out completely steam crashed its steam crash on the other hand grand theft auto and absolutely no problems with that game none at all on the blizzard side modern warfare went off without a hitch as well so we have no idea there's no rhyme or reason to any of these problems it's so weird another thing we noticed was drive speed inconsistencies so the first time you plug it in it runs at its full speed then the next time you plug it in it runs at a completely different speed that's lower and then we had two replug it in yeah and I mean I know what you guys are typing on your keyboard right now it is not due to our test system because we had an insanely fast raid array that was feeding this so it's not I mean that would have been a bottle a we're just gonna post a screenshot of crystal diss mark on that raid array it is insanely fast exactly so another thing that we did is first of all we reach out to Western Digital we reached out to other all the motherboard vendors and they said look there's all these things that you can try and that's exactly what what we did so we tried changing motherboards we try changing platforms cables we even have two of these drives we picked up another one it was the same thing over and over over again I'm talking about fresh Windows install old windows installed different BIOS is absolutely everything we've been testing this thing for better part of two weeks now yeah the other thing that we want to point out is that we're not pointing the finger here at Western Digital the one commonality between all of this is the as media three-two four-two controller that everybody is using right now to power everything from the next $2.99 system to the external cards to the TRX 40 platform so again we don't want to point fingers at either as media or Western Digital but that is the one commonality between all this so hopefully as time goes on they're gonna figure out these issues there's probably some platform incompatible so on Western Digital sparked and then everybody else is it's very very hard to diagnose this because it's so random I mean heck we're ant crystal disk info after this thing aired out and it didn't pick up any errors and that's about the first time that I seen a drive air out and crystal disk info not pick up the information so with that I think we're gonna sort of move on to the benchmarks starting off with synthetics it's pretty obvious that when the Western Digital black P50 isn't having any problems it's ridiculously fast it's almost fast to a point where it almost matches our go to Thunderbolt 3 Drive honestly we've seen a lot of external USB drives over these years and this is by far the fastest one by a long shot even if you don't have a 28 bits per second port it's just as fast as the SanDisk pro xstream SSD moving on to our transfer tests here's where things start to go wrong a full steam library transfer as I mentioned earlier failed every single time sure it transferred over that 10 gigabits per second port but that's not what I really wanted to test as for gaming well it was pretty interesting modern warfare shader loading usually takes forever but there really wasn't much difference between the external drives the only true winner was that corsair and GME SSD the same thing goes for Warhammer 2 other than the fact that the p50 couldn't actually load the game when it was in gen 2x2 mode what about SIF well the WD P50 is fast as an external drive but it could have been so much better if the game would actually load at that full speed finally there was one game that performed without any problems and that was Grand Theft Auto 5 we were finally able to see what this thing could offer and it was pretty amazing shaving off almost 10 seconds of the same game loading time alright so you've seen the numbers this drive is fast when it's fast it's fast guys exactly but I want to know I'm gonna end this conclusion with a quick question would you buy the P 50 right now no because to me I actually prefer using that rog ariane drive because that enclosure itself is like $60 and it can populate that with a traditional nvme SSD which i'm sure you can find on sale maybe Friday or anything and like you've got yourself a really fast portable and mrs. Dean not only that you can upgrade it down the line so if you pick up a one terabyte and eme drive you can swap it out and bring it 4 terabyte drive if you want to so user upgrade ability is certainly there and that's what I love about that rog ariane drive or just any other external enclosure I'm gonna show you I'm gonna say that I would buy it so there's only a certain amount of time in my belief until the issues are ironed out either on as media side or the motherboard vendor side and at that point in time you're gonna have an ultra-fast drive at the same time you can pick it up right now and it would still operate in that 10 gigabits per second mode yeah and it's still one of the fastest drives on the market right now for the USB 3.2 interface on the flip side I wouldn't need the proof that the issues have been fixed that's true you're basically paying for a future tech that's built in that necessarily isn't working but you're hoping that will get solved in the future so that's what I'm gonna draw the line thank you so much for watching let us know what you think about the Western Digital p50 we have two of these I have two of these I don't know what you want to do with with them but thank you so much for watching I'm Heber I'm Mike and I've been frustrated at this thing for two weeks but I'd still buy it we'll see you in the next one guys",

    "transcript": "The Galaxy S8, the newest infinity displayed flagship from Samsung. But what happens when that display breaks? This thing already passed my durability test with flying colors. Now its time to see what this thing is made of, and what it looks like on the inside. Lets get started. [Intro] There are no visible screws along the outside, which is pretty normal for Samsung these days. It does make the phone slightly harder to repair, but not impossible. The process I am demonstrating is going to be pretty much the exact same for both the Galaxy S8 and the S8 Plus. But the replacement parts are going to be different. Ill have those linked separately in the description. Ive warmed up the back of the phone with my heat gun or hair dryer until its just barely too hot to touch. Then I can stick a thin metal pry tool between the metal frame and the glass of the phone. Lift it up just high enough to slip a playing card or business card inside, and that will help you get around that curve without breaking anything. If you need replacement backs, or if you break yours during your repair, they are pretty inexpensive so dont stress out too much. After slicing through both sides, Ill slip my green pry tool in to hold the glass up and keep it from resealing itself onto the phone body. The rest of the adhesive will be easy to cut away after that. Remember its important not to go too deep inside of the phone because there is important stuff under there that can be punctured, like the wireless charging or the battery. So stick around the edges. Once the back glass is free, we can see the fingerprint scanner up along the top. Its still attached to the real panel. The first interesting thing that we find is all the warnings on the battery. You got normal stuff like dont burn, dont puncture, avoid extreme temperatures. And then you get this no dogs allowed sign. Like, Im not a dog person myself, but I dont advocate pet discrimination either. Are cats and goldfish okay? I dont really understand the rules anymore and Samsung just kind of made it weird. There are 14 screws holding down the first layer of guts. The circle-y thing is the wireless charging. We cut open one of these on the Whats Inside YouTube channel. The copper wires coil up to receive power through inductance, and then pass that power through the battery into these pins on the motherboard. Pretty sweet technology. Apple will probably invent this technology in the future for one of their next iPhones. So thats something for iPhone users to look forward to. The battery disconnects from the motherboard easy enough, but there are no magical pull tabs underneath like weve seen on some other phones, so its time to use brute force. Ill use the rounded end of my metal pry tool, taking extreme care not to slice or puncture the battery. I also took special care not to use a dog at any point during this procedure since thats one of Samsungs battery requirements. The battery does look pretty cool. Its got a 3000 milliamp capacity, and it even has a see-through area up at the top for the protection circuit that I talked about during my Note 7 video. The clear plastic on the battery makes me want a clear phone even more. Its also cool that the inside of the phone is the same color as the outside just like what we saw with the red iPhone that I took apart a few weeks ago. The loud speaker is the next piece to come out. Its got a little water damage indicator down at the bottom. Remember, these phones are water resistant and not water proof. It still has those golden contact points where it receives its power and signal from the phone. Before we can remove the charging port, we have to take out the main board. Ill start disconnecting the wire cables at the bottom; there are three of those. Then the screen ribbon unsnaps like a little Lego from the side of the motherboard. After that Ill move up to the front sensor array ribbon cable, and the front facing camera ribbon connector. And then, you know, theres the SIM card tray that I should have removed before we started. At the base of the motherboard theres a Lego connector for the charging port, but its on the underside of the board making things a little more complicated than it should be. Ill give you a better view of that in just a second. Now that the motherboard is out, we have the plastic Samsung heat pipe. This helps keep the processor cool since copper is a better conductor of heat than aluminum is. The thermal transfer away from the processor is more efficient than with copper. Now the rear 12 megapixel camera has its own Lego-like connection on the motherboard. Ill snap that off and push the camera through the board. This is definitely replaceable. Just for kicks and giggles Ill pull out the front facing camera as well. This little guy is attached to the iris scanner. If you look at the rear camera, you can see it move around inside of the frame. This is called the OIS, or optical image stabilization. Ill show you more of how this works in just a second. On the front camera unit, the iris scanner is solid and normally the front facing camera is solid as well, but this one has movement. Samsung didnt advertise having stabilization on this front camera, but it looks like they might have been playing around with the idea of adding it. OIS takes image quality to the next level so it would be pretty awesome if they did. Ill tuck that front facing camera back into the frame and clip the rear camera back into place as well. Lets take a look at that earpiece speaker. Remember, during my durability test I complained that the grill size was way smaller on the new S8 than it was on the older S7. It turns out that the internal speakers are pretty much the same size. If anything, the S8 might even be a little bit larger of a speaker, so no worries there. Since the speaker does sit a little lower than the actual earpiece slot, this channel directs the sound out of the hole in the front. This sensor array at the front is all connected with this ribbon cable. And the volume and Bixby buttons are all connected with these golden contact pads. The round vibrator has its own two contact pads. And the power button is built the same way two little contact pads resting up against the motherboard. Now for the bottom of the phone. The headphone jack is very easily replaceable, just one little screw to hold it in place. And it has the same little Lego style ribbon connector connecting it to the charging port board. You can see the little rubber seal around the headphone jack to help keep the water out. There are 5 more screws holding the charging port board to the frame. And here is the charging port itself. Incredible nice that we dont have the front capacitive button reach around that we saw in the Galaxy S6- that was a nightmare. The charging port is pretty standard. Its got the USBC port and the little microphone off to the side. This phone is actually pretty easy to work on once you get inside that glued shut back glass. From the exterior you can see that there is metal all around the edge of the phone, but now that we have the guts taken out and the internals of the S8 exposed, we can see that its the same hunk of metal throughout the entire device which fully explains the rigidity of the phone. Metal is pretty solid. Theres a little slot in the frame for the screen ribbon to poke through. Speaking of the screen, replacing a cracked display is not cheap or easy with a Samsung. For one, its glued into place. And two, the curved AMOLED panels are pretty expensive. Ill have the current pricing linked in the video description for you. Since the screen is glued in, the old display is essentially sacrificed in the removal process. Once it is heated up and removed, similar to how we did the back panel, just feed the new screen ribbon through the metal frame of the phone and plop it down into place. I did this with the Galaxy S7 teardown if youre interested in seeing the exact process. Since this screen is not broken though, Ill leave it intact. And Ill talk about a few ways to protect your phone towards the end of the video. Assembling the phone is a piece of cake. Charging port gets tucked back into place along with the headphone jack. This is a pretty great use of space, Samsung. There are 6 screws holding down all the components. Then get those round wires tucked into the grooves along the metal frame. Now the charging port is connected at the base of the motherboard which is normal for Samsung, but strange to the rest of us. Ill plug that in before setting the rest of the motherboard into place making sure there are no ribbons or connections stuck underneath the board as it goes down. Ill clip in the front sensor array, and then the iris scanner and front facing camera. There are those 3 signal wires down at the bottom of the motherboard. The circular heads are pretty fragile so make sure you are gentle as you press them into place. And finally the screen ribbon snaps into place like a little Lego. The loud speaker is next. Its easiest to snap the plastic into the metal frame from the bottom edge first. And the last thing we plug in is the battery. This is for the phones own protection. Normally youll want to put adhesive under the battery as well. And you should definitely not turn your phone on at this point, but I kind of want to show you something cool, so Im going to do it anyway. Remember the camera stabilization I talked about earlier? Here it is in action. The camera is turned on right now and the phone hardware is physically stabilizing the camera image to compensate for the shakiness or the movement of my hands. Huge thumbs up for that. Its seriously one of the best features you can have in a smart phone, and not every phone comes with this kind of hardware stabilizing. I think its pretty sweet. I check the front camera, but it doesnt look like there is any kind of movement or stabilizing in the lens. So while Samsung might have considered adding OIS on that front camera, its definitely not enabled at the moment. Now the phone is turned off again. I will set the wireless charging into place and get all 14 screws screwed in. And finally I can clip in the fingerprint scanner ribbon. This is a tedious process that reminds me a lot of the iPhone 5s. I maybe could have popped the fingerprint scanner out of the back glass and set it into place on the inside, but I wanted to keep that seal with the back glass as tight as possible, and my green tool worked just fine. The best kind of repair is the one you dont have to do. The best way to keep your phone from breaking in the future is to protect it with a case or a skin. A naked phone is just asking for trouble. A skin, like the one you see here from dbrand, goes a long way for adding grip, keeping that phone scratch free, and adding a raised surface around the camera lens for a little extra protection. Ill toss a link in the description for you. And thanks to dbrand for supporting this video. Hopefully it will save people money when they break their phones in the future. If you want to check out a few other projects Im working on, Instagram and Twitter have all my behind the scenes. And let me know if you were successful in repairing your own phone. Thanks a ton for watching! Ill see you around.",

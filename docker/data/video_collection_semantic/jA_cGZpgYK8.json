    "transcript": "- Hello, and welcome to \"This Is.\" Today in our episode I'm going to unlive Austin Evans. - I'm very excited. So, all I know right now is Matt says, \"Come in \"with zero in your stomach, \"zero at all.\" - It's not what I said whatsoever. - It's like, you're going in for surgery. - I said, don't have three cups of coffee. - That's the same thing. So, it is currently 1:45 in the afternoon. And I have had absolutely nothing to eat or drink please, gamer food me immediately. - So, we found this wonderful little product. It is \"Pong Energy, Berry Matrix Peanut Butter Crunch.\" And this is a partnership with \"Jobby,\" I guess that's the brand, - And \"Zotac?\" - Yeah, official partnership with \"Zotac.\" Here's the thing about this. This is only available in Malaysia. So, in the process of me trying to find this, I may or may not have gotten our credit card stolen while I was trying to get like approximate, maybe I, they definitely asked for some statements and I'd never received a product. (Austin laughs loudly) - So, now, before we actually eat that, and I'll tell you what's in it. - Yeah. - This just got us wondering what are some other gamer foods? You know, - I don't get to eat this yet? - No, we're gonna save that for later. So, the first one we got was \"Nature's Bounty Brain HP Jelly Beans.\" - Why is it so squished? - Things did not do great. - \"Brain HP, improve your reaction time \"for next level gaming. \"No caffeine, no jitters, \"focus better in as little as 30 minutes.\" Now, \"Nature's Bounty,\" sounds like some sketch balls. Like, homeopathic nonsense sort of brand. - That's pretty much how you're gonna describe all of these gamer foods. - Great. - So, one of the things that caught my eye about this was that it claims to filter out blue light. - Hold on. Okay, explain to me how gummy filters out blue light? Answer, it contains 200 milligrams of Lutein per pack, which helps to filter out blue light and supports visual perception. These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. These products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. - I interpret that is, they'll help you filter out blue light 'cause you're just gonna go blind. - Oh great. - So, go ahead and pop that out. Why don't we pull a couple of those up? Well, I read a couple of these other comments. \"Gaming Jelly Beans are the, the new 3 Red Bull's \"Cracked out of my jorts!\" (Austin laughs loudly) \"Dropped a 27 bomb while fighting with my ex \"about child support, \"next game, 23 bomb, absolutely bonkers.\" - \"One pouch 30 minutes prior to gaming up to twice a day.\" - Oh no, you weren't gonna, oh no. - What? - (laughs) It's okay, they don't have caffeine. - Matt has tasted these? - I have a whole bunch of stuff for you to eat. And I'm worried if you're gonna try all of them. I kinda wasn't joking when I said I might kill Austin Evans. - I gonna try one of these water bottles. - They're sure not bad. - Let me see the other, we had another good comment here. \"Bought these from my boyfriend, a semi-pro gamer, - (laughs) Semi-pro, okay. - And his gaming buddies have told him, \"You have been weaponized,\" because he is getting twice the kills than his average play prior. He also likes to announce, \"I'm on the BEANS boys!\" When he logs in, now, these are actually pretty good. - Look, I'm just gonna say 99.99% of supplements are complete (indistinct) And anyone who thinks that this is a real product is either putting horse tranquilizer in their body or sawdust. 'Cause I feel like it's usually in one of those two categories. - So this is 22% of your daily sugar intake and it's 250 milligrams of cognizin which I don't think that is a real thing. - We're gonna die, we're all gonna die (laughs). - Yeah, we're all gonna die at the end of this episode. So, there's our first thing. - Nevermind. Don't subscribe to this sayings, we're all dead by the time you see this video, this is now evidence. - Next up, we have, \"The Big Yummy Gummy,\" the World's Largest Gummy Game Controller. - Matt, I am not eating your \"Big Yummy Gummy.\" - You're gonna eat my \"Big Yummy Gummy\" and you're gonna like it. - I also love how this says, \"Occasion: Valentine's Day.\" - What? - Honey, I love you so much. - The reason that we actually bought this one was because of the photos of it being presented (Austin laughs loudly) as like an award (indistinct). I can't like imagine you gave this to your wife. Instead of that like, hey (Austin laughs). - My favorite thing about this though is how like they didn't even bother to like try photoshopping this, like it comes over the edge. - Happy Valentine's day, honey. I got you the \"Big Yummy Gummy.\" - Yo, give me this. All right, I'm really hungry. And this feels like the item today. That is gonna kill me the least. So I'm just gonna dive then. I need help, I need an adult. - Oh, don't worry. I'll get your \"Big Yummy Gummy\" in your tummy. - Thanks Matt. All right, we're gonna first investigate the texture of the \"Big Yummy Gummy.\" (Matt laughs loudly) So, rip. - Ah, well, I wanted to have a bite of that, but, - Not, what does it smell, not bite Matt, calm down. - I'm not you. Oh, I can smell the blue raspberry which is kind of messy with my head because it green. - [Kinsey] Look how floppy it is (laughs)! - I'm gonna turn, oh, pressing the sticks, just squishes them down. Oh, can we let this in the tramp, this right now? - Yeah. (soft music) (Kinsey laughs) - I wish you could say it's the first time I've done that with Matt, but I don't think it is. - It's so thick. - It's fine. - It tastes fine. - Yeah. - But like the thickness of it - I'm just gonna apologize to Erin in advance for all the chewing sounds into the mic this episode. (people screaming) I think you shared? - Yeah, I think so. - Okay. - You going in for Number 2? You're that hungry? - Man, I haven't eaten anything in like 18 hours. - We're gonna have to check your pulse periodically throughout this to make sure it's not like triple over what should be. - I don't understand who wants this, but it's kind of a funny product. I get to bond it, it's also tasty. - There are six ounces, that's a lot. - Sure you want one more bite. - No, - I'm hungry, okay. I don't need this judgment in my life right now, okay, Matt? - Speaking of judgment, your friends will judge you if you don't come to the gaming party with this next product. So, this is the \"Git Gud Elite Gaming Inhaler.\" - Oh, hell no. - I did preface to Austin that I did not expect him to eat most of this stuff. - It's made in Detroit. - \"The Meta of Focus, play it cool \"and evaluate competitive game play during intense matches.\" Basically what this is implying is that you can just take this and you can see in the fourth dimension. (Austin chuckles) So, do you need the knife again? - Nope. - It has a very well removed thing. - Okay? - Okay. \"So, if you're pregnant or breastfeeding \"ask a healthcare professional before \"sniffing Git Gud Gaming Inhaler\" - I am doing both of those things but let's roll those dice. - I feel this is fine though. \"Cause they say inhaler. I don't think you actually inhale anything, you just sniff it. (gentle music) - Ready? - No I'm, oh no. - I mean, are you still on Step 1, \"Remove fresh shield?\" - Yes. - I'm ready for, \"Crush the competition.\" (Kinsey laughs) - I'm hungry, okay? - Okay, so hurry up. - So, I open it up. Put it, oh God, okay. - All right, cheers. - (Matt and Austin sniff in deeply) Wow! - Oh! - I think we just vape. - Oh (Austin laughs) it smells great. - I mean it's, - It does. - 100% menthol, - Yeah. - Like straight up your nostril. - Yeah, woo. (Austin inhales deeply) - I don't like that. - Woo woo! Is my nose bleeding right now? 'Cause it feels like it's bleeding right now. - I do feel like my nose is about to start like running or something. - Okay. - So, we have some reviews for this guy. Did anyone use it for sex? I think it's safe to say anyone buying this isn't having sex. - Yeah, that's fair. - Like my head is like, I feel lightheaded. I don't feel like I have like more energy now but like I do feel like my head is swimming with this right now. - I'm not sure why I just took such a huge sniff of that. Well, it was around my nose I inhaled as hard as I can. - Let's see the next one. This one here. - No, absolutely not. Addall XR Brain Boost Supplement. It's Adderall. Oh my God. - So, - Oh my God, no. (Matt laughs loudly) Oh gee. Addall, not Adderall. That would be illegal, \"Addall, \"Add focus to your day, \"two 750 milligram capsules.\" - Do you see the pack? The ingredients, proprietary blend, that's the only listed ingredient. Are you kidding me right now? - \"Take one to two capsules with food. \"Do not exceed two capsules in that 24 hour period.\" This should be illegal. Someone needs to call the police. - I wanna say that a good amount of the questions and answers were people being like, \"Is this illegal? \"Will I fail a drug test?\" - If it's not illegal, this should 1000% be illegal. - I'm not taking, - We're not taking this. So we'll be moving on. Actually my life and my nose is actually just like, I feel it, right here. - The first few Jelly Beans I ate are starting to hit me right now. - He's cracked out of his JORTS and he's on the Beans. Here we go. - Hasn't any of this stuff hit you yet? - Yeah, I have a headache from the inhaler. I don't feel like I have more energy. It just like my brain hurt now. - I'm sitting up about an inch higher than I was at the beginning of this video. Aaron, you can look this up. You can see I'm up here, I started here. - All right, so. - I'm up here, now. (soft music) - Now, we're back to what started this entire video. The \"Zotac, Jobby Gaming Peanut Butter.\" - So this is the \"World's First Nut Butter for Gamers.\" It is \"Berry Matrix Peanut Energy Crunch.\" All right, how I'm gonna try this nut butter. - You wanna know what's in it? 'Cause it's incredibly simple. - I mean, it's got like some lumpy bits. That's not necessarily crunchy. - Oh, it's gonna crunch. - Okay. - So, we got some - Yeah, so there's a lot of blue and red bits. I mean, I'm just gonna do it. Is there anything in here? Did you crush up any Adderall pills in this? - No. - Okay, cool. - I don't get-- - So, what this has is what the blue and red bits are, are freeze dried strawberries and blueberries. - That's so delightful. - And it says like the ingredients is just peanut butter, sugar, and these berries. I took that as if this is in Malaysia, that's probably just a natural peanut butter. And if it's sugar, you know what? American peanut butter has a lot of sugar in it. So, I got just peanut butter. I don't like those noises. - My lips, a little stuck together right now. I've never eaten peanut butter just right off the spoon. But as the product prescription says-- - Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold the phone. You don't just eaten spoon full of peanut butter? - Who eats spoon full of peanut butter man? - Ted Lasso. He keeps a jar full of peanut butter on his counter. - Matt, Ted Lasso is not a real person. (woman laughs quietly) - It is good, right? - It's very sticky. My lips keeps sticking together. - So, here's the thing, that didn't seem gamer enough for me. - Okay. - I took it upon myself. to make my own \"Gamer Peanut Butter.\" - Wait, what? There's more peanut butter? - Might I present to you? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! This is branded \"Gamer Nut Butter.\" - Yeah, do you have to call it \"Gamer Nut Butter?\" Like there's better names. - Let me see this. - This is the reason I told you not to drink any caffeine prior to coming here. - What did you put in this Matt? What did you put in this? - I want you to take a spoonful of it first. - What did you, so I had to eat this and then I-- - I want you to take a small spoonful of this. - Oh, that's very like, goopy, like I could pour this peanut butter. Do I need stir it or just go for it? - I mean did this is the one time you're not gonna smell something? Are you kidding me? - What the hell is that? It smells like an energy bar, is the best way to describe it. It's a weird sort of smell. Okay, how big of a spoonful should I get? - That's good. - Okay. I'm about to eat, \"The Gamer Nut Butter\" filled with crushed up substances that are surely not gonna get me in trouble. That's sugar. Oh, (Matt laughs loudly) Just like pixie sticks, but, - Are you familiar with G FUEL? (Matt and Austin laugh loudly) Did you know that G FUEL already makes a flavor dedicated to the Austin Evans Channel? - Okay. - Called \"Click Bait.\" - You just make \"G FUEL Peanut Butter.\" (Matt and Austin laugh loudly) I thought it was like a pixie stick or something but like, no, but there's something more nefarious in here. - So there are two servings of of G FUEL in this jar of peanut butter. So this is like a Berry. - Oh, the aftertaste. - I wanna take it one step further. 'Cause I know that you're a huge fan of peanut butter and jelly. - Yeah I am. - So what I introduced to you - Oh God. - This is \"The Gamer Sour Jelly.\" - You spent way too much time on this video. It looks so purple. - Yeah. - This is the most purple thing I've ever seen, all right. Everyone's laughing way too much. Everyone just is like trying to hold it. Okay, okay. Okay, I know that flavor. - It's more G FUEL. - Oh my God. - So we have \"Sour Pixel Potion.\" - I don't know why I had to ask. Of course, you're just loading me with G FUEL, right now. When you doing your G FUEL drop Matt? All right, I'm gonna make a (indistinct) now, do you have--? - So, - I need to combine the most G FUEL experience possible. - So, you guys are all big fans of the $500 Toaster. If you guys don't know about this, this is the Mitsubishi something model number. It's a Japanese toaster that cooks one slice of bread at a time. Listen to it, let's do it. It's letting you know that the bread's getting ready. - It's ticking patience. I will say with this toaster I thought this was the biggest gimmick in the world until I had a piece of toast from it. - It's delicious. - It 100% gives you the perfect piece of toast. - Here you go, here you go. (beep) - The hold. All right, I'm gonna just load it up. Make sure my peanut butter application is perfect. - I had this for dinner, FYI. Like I ate one of these sandwiches for dinner a week ago. And I haven't been to bed since. I haven't been awake ever since then - I'm gonna pull up the text that you sent me because (the two laugh loudly) He said, \"Oh no, the G FUEL Peanut Butter, thing slaps, \"WTF Have I created, \"Kinsey, I ate it for dinner. \"And now my heart is racing so fast \"that I can see new colors.\" And I said, \"You ate it for dinner?\" And he said, \"Don't worry, \"There is plenty of Gamer Nut Butter for all.\" Then he said, \"God has been defeated. \"I'm on Phase 2, mega god.\" - Are you sure that G FUEL's the only thing in this case. Let's have (indistinct) - This came through at like 11 when I was about to go to bed and I was like, \"Matt, you're gonna die.\" - I gotta say, there's a lot of G FUEL in my mouth right now. I'm not sure that I like the-- - One thing I was really worried about this is that I was gonna be like gritty, but it's not. - My mouth tastes like I just ate a pile of pixie sticks. It's a little, a little bit much. Wait, Kinsey, do you want one? - (laughs) No. (the trio laugh) - Wow, wow! - This is like photogenic. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Mm. - Mm. - That taste bad (indistinct). - What are you talking about? It tastes delicious. Nope, no, I got the taste, nevermind, scratch that. Scratch that. I regret everything I said about this tasting good now. - I think it's the fact that that (indistinct) G FUEL in my PPG right now. - We have four servings in here. - (sighs) Well, what have we learned today Matt? - We've learned that gaming foods are a concept that probably should be left alone. I will say the actual gaming peanut butter from \"Zotac.\" That's actually pretty good. I could see that becoming like a mainstream thing. - No, I will say everyone needs more nut butter in their lives. - Let us know in the comments. What other gamer foods you think we should have tried? Let us know what else he wants us to try in the comments, like subscribe, ring the notification bell. And we will not see you in the next one because My heart rate, - I bet say, \"My heart just skipped to beat.\" And that just a good thing. - Yeah, like this whoaa! (upbeat music)",

    "transcript": "- Well, Linus has already on box to the other two M1 Macs on Short Circuit to varying reception. So here I am with the MacBook Pro 13 inch. This is completely sealed. It's even still got the little Apple tab here. You can Probably tell the tone of this video is gonna be a little different. Ooh, yeah. The thing about good packaging, is that it creates a seal, you know, all right. So here's the laptop. Let's set that aside for now. Down in here, we've got the traditional Apple packet with a nice Apple stickers. Got the nice paper (paper tearing) (paper rustling) covering for our included power adapter. I think this might be the same-- No, it's a 61 watt power adapter. That's USB type C. This is a USB type C cable, of course, as with most Apple USB type C cables, it's Probably not gonna be wired for data. So on the side here, we've got a very uncourageous headphone jack, I guess headset combo jack. And on the other side, we've got the only expansion we're allowed. We've got two USB type C 4.0 slash thunderbolts ports. USB 4.0 is basically Thunderbolt. Thunderbolt three is more or less an implementation of USB four at this point. Intel opened it up to the USB implementers forum. I think Apple will Probably drop the Thunderbolt moniker at some point in the near future, but don't quote me on that. Oh, that's kind of unfortunate. I'm trying to lift it open. - [Jono] Come on Craig. - Oh, there we go. Oh, okay. I didn't even, I didn't do anything. I wasn't gonna power it on yet. - [Jono] Because, we have a new sponsor. - That is true.

So once again, this is the Apple M1 equipped MacBook Pro with eight cores, eight GPU cores and 16 gigs of RAM. We've also got 512 gigs of storage on here. And as for the display, it is, I think basically the same as the MacBook Air with a slightly better backlight, which is really interesting. The differences between the MacBook Pro and the Air are evaporating quickly with the M1 with the very big exception of the fact that this thing actually has a cooler in it. With the two side by side, it's pretty obvious that the MacBook Pro is if not a lot brighter, it's brighter. But do I really need to talk about the keyboard quality? It's the magic keyboard, it's fine. It feels pretty much what you would expect. Like there is basically no give whatsoever to this keyboard. The keys feel responsive and sharp. Even pressing them on the corners. It basically just goes straight down. Yeah, I've got no complaints whatsoever about this keyboard. This is the Pro, it's actually pretty thin on its own. And this is the Air also very thin. Honestly, the wedge shape of the Pro makes the keyboard slightly more ergonomic. - [Jono] The Air. - Sorry, the Air. See, look, I'm doing it now. (Jono laughing) Whereas this, ah, you're kinda resting your hands on basically a raised flat surface. Let's see the MacBook here we got was this one. And all we did to it was add 16 gigs of memory. So $1,449 the MacBook Pro we got. So it was $1,499, 'cause we got the 512 gig model because for some reason, 256 gigs is the standard and that's $1,699. It kinda makes sense. I do wish they had added like, I don't know, two more CPU cores, something to differentiate it a little bit more. (bright upbeat music) Oh that sounds amazing. (upbeat music) I know this is Probably no different than the way it's been before, but the stereo imaging it sounds good enough that I'm like, oh, this must be a spatial effects. But no, not really. Let's listen to the MacBook Air. (upbeat music) So this feels like it's got a little bit more in the mids and the low end. Whereas this is a little bit more shrill, but it's not actually shrill. It's just like, it's a little bit thinner. Well, it is what I mean. Very interesting, I thought they had the exactly the same speakers maybe they do. And it's just that the deeper chassis allows it to kind of reverberate a little bit more. So what else is there to say really? I mean, it's got the same CPU, the same guts, really as the higher end MacBook Air with eight GPU cores. But even without that, it's got the eight CPU cores anyway. So, why buy the MacBook Pro? The answer, I guess comes down to do you like the touch bar? (laughing) There's that, but there's also the cooler and while I can't show you exactly the difference between the two of these right now, I can do that in the review. And I can tell you that the MacBook Air is totally silent because it has no fan, no moving parts whatsoever. And that actually means that it may be the more ironically, the more long lived computer, because think about it. It's not sucking in dust. It doesn't have to worry about air flow. It has no way of the fan ever dying. Whereas this, it's going to suck in dust. You're gonna have to clean it out from time to time, like every other computer. The fan is obviously, but it's got a service life and it may or may not last for the nearly 10 years that mine has. On top of that, Apple is I can confirm this much, allowing the MacBook Pro to run at its full potential for much longer than the MacBook Air. And in fact, it throttles down in preliminary testing anyway, to about 60 degrees after a certain period of time. You dig a little bit deeper into that. But the MacBook Air actually seems like a pretty bulletProof computer. It's kinda weird. Whereas the Pro it's got the same guts. You can run it harder for longer, but in burst workloads, like pretty much anything you do on the internet or even things like Photoshop or dare I say Final Cut the MacBook Air should be able to handle most of that. No Problem. It's really weird. For the first time in a long time, the MacBook Air is just as desirable, at least to me, as the MacBook Pro. In fact more so because it's got the top row, it doesn't have the touch bar. I really feel like I would need more for a Pro device. I feel like if Apple had given it, I don't know, like two more cores that would have been the push. The performance is again, basically the same, unless you're doing long workloads. Like I don't know, compiling, video transcoding, that kinda thing. And even then it's got the hardware transcoding engine as well. So yeah, it's a really strange time to be into the Apple ecosystem. And I'm looking forward to getting the review out to you guys. I guess that's about it. (laughing) Thanks for watching Short Circuit. Maybe watch another one. Stay tuned and goodbye.",

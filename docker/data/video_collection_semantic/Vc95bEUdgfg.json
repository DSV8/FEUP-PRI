    "transcript": "- All right, guys, today we are going to cover the Razer Hammerhead truly wireless earbuds, and I am blind. I know nothing about this. This is a way bigger box. They can't possibly have this box on the shelves. Razer Hammerhead True Wireless Pro, free from noise. I don't know if that means, 'cause it has noise cancellation, or because it doesn't have a lot of distortion. Hopefully both. Advanced hybrid ANC, THX certified sound. Not sure how I stand on this. I guess maybe they're just trying to say that these are also good for watching movies, but a lot of the time when you see \"THX certified\", certifications like that, it's a new way to charge more money for something that lots of products have the capability of passing. Okay, now I see the packaging that you're gonna see in store. This looks like the actual headphone box. Very slim. This is - what is this? THS case? Does this not have a charge case? Or is this just like a skin? Okay, we're gonna find out. And then, here we have a phone case, in case I have a new Apple iPhone 6.1 inch, apparently. I don't. Is there an Easter egg under this confetti? Okay. Put it in your hamster cage. Let's start with the goods. (plastic crinkling) THX certified. Am I doing this right? (groans) Oh, that's some friction. How do you design a box like that, you know? Crazy. Okay, there is a charge case in here, thank God. A bunch of instructions I hope I don't need. This case. This is a good size. This looks like it's smaller and lighter than the case from the Sony WF-1000XM3's, and the weight of it is 43 grams. I don't normally weigh the charge case but this just feels very light in the hand. It says Razer on the top, embossed. That's cool. (case clicks) Sounds okay. Wait a second, though, which side is this? This is left. It goes on the left, that's nice. Okay. Bare minimum, you know? Okay, and what else is in the box? That green light on there is cool. Very Razer. We have a charging cable. This is USB-C for here. It's a Razer branded cable. It's very short. Maybe that's 16 inches or something. It's braided, and on the other side it terminates at a nice green USB-A. Oh, these are foam ear tips in here, and then these are the silicone ones. Those kind of look medium, those are bigger, and those are tiny, and of course there are some already on the headphone. That looks like the same size. So you get extra of the medium one. They go in. Huh. I feel like it's pretty in my left ear but not so in my right ear. I think they go in farther than an AirPod though. The seal is okay. Now, do I pair through the case or through the headphone? Oh, it's already appearing in here, so that's good. \"Bluetooth connected.\" What a dork voice they have in here. \"Hi, thanks for choosing Razer. \"I get my braces off really soon.\" Not say braces are dorky. Well, braces are dorky. I have braces. I kind of want to try the foam ear tips though. I wonder if these are specifically made for these or not, because the ear tips have a round port, pole, whereas the male end on the Razer is actually an ellipse. On the silicone one, it doesn't really matter. You just get it on there. But on the foam one, it feels like I'm kind of forcing it. It doesn't really want to go on there. I mean, it works. Oh yeah. Pretty isolating, for not being completely in your ear. Oh, my God, it's playing music suddenly. This is way louder than I would normally do, but it's also very clear and very groovy. I guess we're suddenly doing the music test. I wasn't ready for this, but okay. But hold on a second. First, a message from our sponsor, Blinkist, who takes non-fiction books and smushes them down into 15 minutes. Over 14 million people use Blinkist 'cause it's actually pretty sweet, and you can either read or listen from their smartphone app books like The AI Economy, that discusses the rise of artificial intelligence and how that's going to affect our jobs and investment and lifestyle, and members who like full-length audio books can get 65% off the retail price of those. Now Blinkist has partnered with popular podcasts which are shortened as well. That's crazy. The first 100 people who go to blinkist.com/shortcircuit are gonna get unlimited access for one week, and then 25% off. Do. I am going to put on my new favorite band. I don't know how to say their name. Khruangbin? That's what I call them. Very smooth music. These are pretty damn good. I have it pretty loud, which is kind of cheating. Usually the louder you turn something up, to a point, it sounds better because your ears are more sensitive to certain frequencies. Now, of course, if you turn it up very loud, that's when you can expose the crappiness of headphones, if they start to get distorted or harsh-sounding. I have it at about three quarters right now, and they still sound pretty good. These have pretty deep bass. Okay, let's put on some tunes that I know really well. California is a little bit warmer You know what's always a good sign? When you put on a song that you maybe never listened to in headphones before, and you notice a bunch of stuff you never noticed before. So some people have described that as being really articulate. I would say these are pretty articulate. I can hear lots of different instruments going on. Yeah, these are pretty damn good. Okay, now let's see about the interface. How do they work? Is this play? Are they touch? I have no idea. They've got to have some controls on them. If it's all phone, I'm gonna be... I swear to God, if this is another headphone review where I really like the sound but hate the interface I'm gonna be so cheefed. The fact that I have to open up the instructions is already a bad sign. Okay, two seconds. I think that turns the noise canceling on. Oh, fragrant instruction manual. It's off-gassing. Okay, so the green light on here is the battery indicator light. Okay, you can turn them on by holding down for two seconds. Tap, answer, call, end a call, replay, pause media. So that is supposed to play and pause. Oh, okay, that worked. I think I just did it like a slower... I think instead of going like, \"pop\", I really smushed my finger pad onto it. That's acceptable. A little learning curve there, but whatever. ANC on. All right, I need a crying baby here. (Jono imitates baby crying) I couldn't hear that at all. - [Jono] Oh, really? - Yeah, at all, at all. Okay, now I'm gonna turn ANC off, and I want to know... (Jono imitates baby crying) Okay, ambient is on, and I still can hear it, but not that much, like even my own talking. I still feel like I'm wearing earplugs, which I essentially am. So I don't know about the ambient mode. It's supposed to be using its microphones to amplify things around me, and it's kind of not. Okay, now it's off. Let me hear your \"wah\". (Jono imitates baby crying) Okay, I can hear you. It's very quiet, but I can hear that you're doing that. And it pauses when you pull this out, that's nice. Interface is okay. It functions the way I would want it to. It's just a little annoying to use, 'cause you have to kind of press hard. It's not very sensitive. Maybe that'll save you in a couple of situations though. Razer Hammerhead app, there it is. How does this have 50,000 downloads already? Location required. Okay. Only this one time. Now I open. Connected. Begin the tutorial? Sure. Let's do it, guys. We're in this together. All right, try other gestures. Single, double. Oh, there's a triple tap. What's that for? Oh, previous track. Remapping. Oh, man, they give you so many options. I don't think I've ever seen options this robust. So your options are play, pause, next track, previous track, stop, voice assistant, game mode, ANC, or just nothing. It's cool that they have a nothing button, because then I could avoid misclicks, but I feel like I don't need it because this is already so hard to press. So make it easier to press. You get all those same options no matter which action you're looking at, and the actions are single press, double tap, triple tap, long press for two seconds, triple tap and hold last tap for two seconds. Oh, and then you have all these options again if you're on a call. So a single press while on a call, triple tap while on a call. This is nice. I want to see this emulated in other apps. Okay. These guys are kind of two for two right now. They sound good, and the usability is pretty good. You get separate battery indicators for each headphone here in the app. EQ presets. So you can totally make your own. They've got THX, amplified, enhanced bass, vocal, and enhanced clarity. That is most of it, except there's a settings button here. Earbud fitting test? The fit test is designed to improve the overall sound and noise cancellation of your Hammerheads by reducing sound leakage. I'm gonna do this. Put on both earbuds and ensure a comfortable fit before taking the test. Take the test. Both your earbuds are a perfect fit. I didn't even do anything. I think what it does is it plays music and it also runs the microphones at the same time, and it's trying to ensure that the microphones don't pick up that sound beyond a certain volume threshold. So I guess they were sealed good, and there wasn't a lot of leakage. That's just a cool thing that they put in. Cool. I'm happy with the app. Build quality seems okay. Sound quality sounded quite good. Price? Jono? - [Jono] 199! - 200 bucks. Okay, 200 bucks. So at $200, these are more like $20 to $30 more than Samsung Galaxy Buds live or the Google Pixel buds. So a little more than those, but not as expensive as some of the heavy hitters from Bose. Not bad. They don't suck. I mean, they're Razer, so you never really know. (laughs) Maybe they're not gonna last that long. - [Jono] It does come with a 2-year warranty. - 2-year warranty, though. I mean, and plus you get their little promise here. - [Jono] My only thing is, they only last for four hours. - Four hours of playback isn't the longest battery life I've seen in the category, but it's not the worst. It's kind of standard. Do you know, do they have any rating for waterproof? - [Jono] IPX4. - IPX4. That's basic. So you'll be fine for working out at the gym and getting splashed with sweat and stuff. Just don't wear these in the shower. Overall, I'm kind of impressed with these. I'm going to give them a recommendation. They're pretty cool. Price is kind of middle of the road but the sound quality, I would say, is better than a lot of the stuff you get at that lower price tier, so they probably deserve to cost more than the Pixel buds, for example. Let's see what the heck this was. Oh no. Okay, this is just another case. Oh, it's a hard shell for the case. It's a ruggedizer. Okay. This is kind of cool. Wow, the setup sure is easy. I'm done already. Yeah, and then you can put this onto your backpack, so it hangs right there. That's what I do when I'm traveling, you know? - [Jono] Pocket test? - Pocket test with this on? I don't dig Linus' pocket test, okay? He thinks things need to fit into here. It's definitely not gonna, with this. This isn't even for that. Okay, in my nudies, they fit in here, but it's so annoying to try to make that happen, and so tight on the hip that that's just dumb. Everyone knows this pocket is for lock-picking tools. (laughing) Yeah, in the pocket, that's fine. That's not much more than a wallet. I'm not gonna hate on anyone who wants to buy these. I wouldn't see these and be like, Oh God, buddy bought those. I think these are fine. Good job, Razer. Christmas, 200 bucks. Worth a look. I would say these are worth putting into your roundup evaluation, your spreadsheet that you're gonna make where you're comparing all the features. These are worth a look.

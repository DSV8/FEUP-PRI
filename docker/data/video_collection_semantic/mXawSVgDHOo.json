See, as different as they look, all these generation-5 smartwatches from the Fossil Group actually pack the same basic guts  just like a hundred years ago, when manufacturers would put the same mechanical movement into a variety of cases to sell different styles.

    "transcript": "- [Man] You might think the modern smart watch doesn't have much in common with its century-old mechanical ancestor, but tell them, Mr. Frakes. - It's false. No way, not this time. - [Man] That's right. As different as they look, all these watches pack the same basic guts, just like a hundred years ago, when manufacturers would put the same mechanical movement into a bunch of different cases to sell different styles. That's why the Fossil Group has the widest selection of smart watches running Google's platform, but watch out for the double-edged sword. That same platform is what makes them tougher to recommend. (cool instrumental music) To be clear, this is not an ad for Fossil Group. There are other compelling Wear OS options out there, like the Montblanc Summit 2, the Movado Connect 2, et cetera. But the reason I've been so fixated on Fossil Group lately is the sheer volume of options they give you. I've been test-driving three of them for about a month. The Michael Kors Lexington 2, the Diesel On Axial, and Emporio Armani Connected 3. Now these are all based on what I consider to be the prototypical fifth generation platform, Fossil's own Carlyle HR, which I've been wearing on and off for about four months. Since they all share that same gen five core, they all pack the latest features, like a builtin speaker and microphone for talking to Google Assistant and taking calls, even, thanks to custom Fossil software, on an iPhone. GPS, check. NFC for mobile payments, yes. Wifi for when your phone isn't near, here. They all even use the same charger. At this point, Fossil and its partner brands have figured out most of the basics pretty well, too. All the screens are vibrant, all the casings are swim-proof, and all these have two pushers and a rotating side button. And that's no minor detail. That active crown makes using a smart watch incalculably more enjoyable. If you're thinking of buying a Wear OS watch that doesn't have one, well, don't. Let's talk about the styling that sets them apart. The Lexington 2 from Michael Kors is absolutely trying the hardest to look nice, and in some ways, it succeeds. I love a watch with heft, and with its metal bracelet, this thing has plenty of it, but I also don't like it when a watch only looks good with one bracelet style, particularly one that requires you to pop out these fiddly pins to adjust its size. On the flip side is the Armani, which has these playful color options for the aluminum casing and whose rubber band can easily be swapped out. It's too light for me, but probably a great fit for you if you need a watch that looks just as good at the dinner table as it does on the treadmill. Just be careful around the crystal. I'm not sure what this is made of, but I've never been able to scratch a watch this easily. I don't even know how I did it. And for those who really wanna turn up the beef-o-meter, well, as usual, Diesel has you covered. It looks like a pipe flange strapped to a belt, with button textures that look ready to peel off your fingerprint. I feel like this is the kind of watch you'd buy if you drove a Cybertruck, and if you missed my video test-driving that thing, subscribe to the channel so you don't miss another one. Anyway, the choice in hardware there is the biggest advantage Wear OS has over the other platforms, and it's a big reason I've been using it for years, but more recently, I've come to realize that that choice in hardware just isn't enough for me to overlook my issues with the software. The initial setup is really slow. Don't do this off the charger, because it takes so long to get through the updates, you won't make it through the morning. A customer's first exposure to Wear OS is this very slow tutorial that's beset with connection issues. Even after your setup, there's just bug after bug. The watches will randomly disconnect from the phone every so often. Periodically, they'll stop buzzing your wrist for notifications, even though the alert is delivered. I tried giving Google Fit my health info on one of these, and it just wouldn't save. Why? I don't know. Sometimes the rotating side button just doesn't work. Why? I don't know. Wear OS can't even tell time reliably. Most of this stuff is Google's fault. It needs to fix Wear OS, and maybe its recent acquisition of Fitbit will help it do that, but the individual brands have their own hiccups, too. Diesel in particular ships this watch face that, as far as I can tell, exists to serve up mild insults every few minutes, which is sort of funny, but it's also slow, and it also breaks the RSP. Also, Fossil hasn't had the greatest reputation for quality control. Hop on over to the Wear OS subreddit, and you'll find reports of charging rings popping off on the latest generation, which is not a new problem. I can end this on a positive note, because that Fossil Carlyle HR I first went hands-on with back in the summer, well, I promised more thoughts after I'd used it for a while, and you know, I kind of love it, despite Wear OS. It looks terrific. I love the practical yet refined balance Fossil has struck here, especially with the custom Jack Mason band I stuck on it. I appreciate that I don't have to go hunt down a ton of watch faces, because Fossil bundles in over 50 out of the box. I like the custom battery modes, which help it last a little longer or a lot longer depending on how many features you wanna give up. These modes are available on all of the watches in this video. And I like knowing that if any of the hardware issues I've read about do crop up, I can take it into a Fossil retail store and be assured that they'll take care of me, because Fossil has a great reputation for customer service. The company informed me that that charging ring popping off problem is known to them, and it's only affecting a small batch of units apparently, but regardless, affected customers can just take them into a store and they'll get taken care of. Now, is all of that enough to earn a recommend? Well, if the watch goes on sale like it just did before this review for something like 100 bucks off, then yeah, that's a good deal. If that happens again, jump on it, and if I see it, I'll drop a link in the description, but at the full price of $295, or 350 for Diesel, at 375 for Armani, or even 262 for Michael Kors... (sighs) I wanna say yes, because I wanna recognize the awesome hardware and design work these companies have put in, but until Wear OS is better and remains reliably better for more than a handful of weeks before something else breaks, well, recommending Google-powered smart watches will continue to be pretty difficult. Fortunately for we consumers, the competition has not been sitting still. Stay tuned for a fun review of some Garmin wearables coming up, and I'm gonna try to get a hold of the folks who have licensed the Moto 360 name for that new device. It's not Motorola, but it could be fun anyway. Check out Android Central for a forthcoming review on that as well. This review was produced following four months with various gen five review samples provided by Fossil Group. I don't produce paid reviews, though. No compensation changed hands and Fossil was not offered a preview of this video prior to publication. That means they're seeing it for the first time right alongside you. Please subscribe and share this video if you'd like to see more like it on YouTube. Until next time, thanks for watching, and stay mobile, my friends.",

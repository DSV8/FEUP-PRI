    "description": "[UPDATE: Part 2 is now live here:   The LG G7 has had a long and strange road to release, at least from an outsider's perspective. A flurry of reports back in January indicated that LG would delay the launch of its newest smartphone; that it might ditch the \"G\" branding entirely; even that it was considering redesigning the flagship \"from scratch.\" Well as it turns out, only one (and a half) of those predictions panned out: the phone was indeed delayed from its expected February release until May, and while the G brand remains, it's now augmented by the \"ThinQ\" suffix LG is slapping on all its AI-enabled products.   Sadly, the rumor that the company would ditch the iterative approach in order to completely rethink its smartphone strategy proved false: the G7 is an LG phone through and through. That carries a lot of positives, from the superwide cameras to MIL-STD durability to an impressive new audio system  but it also means LG is likely to focus its marketing on the phone's more buzzworthy (and far less impressive) \"AI\" features.   I've spent four days with the LG G7 ThinQ. Join me for the Initial Review / Hands-On  and stay tuned for the full LG G7 Review coming soon!

    "transcript": "- [Michael] If there's one lesson that stuck with me after a week in South Korea, it's that LG makes everything: TVs, refrigerators, giant HVAC units, even elevators. So I shouldn't have been surprised to see the company announce record profits last week, except, well, I was, because I cover mobile tech, and LG's smartphone division has been pretty consistently losing money since 2015. That's a problem the brand-new LG G7 looks to solve with upgraded cameras, updated styling, and a boom box. This is part one of the MrMobile review, the first-impressions pass. (funky electronic music) The reason this is only half a review is that I only spent three days with the LG G7 and its software was updated every night. So I couldn't test things like battery life. Also, LG said several times that the camera was still being worked on, as well. So, let's call this an initial review. Stay tuned for the final verdict coming in a later video after a longer soak. LG phones have a habit of staying in my pocket well after my reviews end, and there's one reason for that: They're the only ones at the high end that devote a lens to wide-angle shots. That means if you're in a tight space, like, say, a mud hut in the Jeju Folk Village, you don't have to settle for a photo like this. You just switch over to the wide-angle, and you can squeeze in a lot more, without moving an inch. Or, if you're on a boat on the Yellow Sea, and ya can't get far enough from the rail to frame a shot better than this, the wide-angle's gotcha there, too. See, for my money, this is LG's most compelling feature. On the G7, for the first time, the sensor behind the wide-angle lens is the same as the sensor behind the main camera. In previous models the wide-angle camera has had to make do with an inferior sensor. There are compromises, to be sure. They're not the same aperture; there's no optical stabilization on the wide camera; and it's slightly less wide this year. It's down to 107 degrees, from 125. But I don't have to wait for final software to say that it's still the best ultra-wide shooter you'll get on a phone, at least without slapping on a big third-party lens. Now, rather than leaning in to that concrete differentiator, this thing that no one else is doing, really, LG is more enthused about buzzwords, specifically, AI. It does the same thing as on the updated V30 we saw in Barcelona. It adjusts color and saturation based on what it thinks you're pointing at. And there's now also a portrait mode to do that fake depth-of-field thing. Back on the bright side. One of the biggest failings of the last two LG phones has been the mediocre selfie camera, and that's been corrected with the G7. The new eight-megapixel sensor is capable of much crisper photos with a lot more texture, and it, too, uses a wide-angle lens to fit more in the frame. I'll share more camera samples, stills, and video in part two. For now, let's move on to audio. The G7 still offers a headphone jack and a high-quality DAC to back it up, both rarities, these days. For external audio, LG has a new feature, aptly named Boombox Mode. See, rather than go the typical route of including dual speakers, the G7 has a single bottom driver, but the internal casing that ordinarily surrounds that speaker has been removed. That lets the entire inner volume of the phone serve as a resonance chamber, which makes it louder, especially when you rest it on a hard surface. These things here, they are not accessories offered for sale; they're just empty wooden boxes that LG used to show how much louder the G7 can get than, say, the G6, or the Galaxy S9, or the iPhone. We even listened to the phone bumpin' tunes on a guitar. Obviously, these are just demos. Even if all you've got is a table, the G7 will still fill a room better than any other phone, with the possible exception of the Razr Phone. A few more deets from my first few days. LG went with an LCD panel on the G7. Eh. But it gave it a special brightness boost that kicks it up to about 1,000 nits, on demand. Yes, that's a notch you're seeing up top. It's hardly the last one we'll see this year. If it bugs you, you can flick a switch in the software to hide it away. The fingerprint sensor around back no longer doubles as the power-standby button, which has been moved to the side. Flanking it on the opposite rail is a dedicated Google-Assistant button. No, you can't reprogram it. The whole shebang is dust and water-resistant. And, thanks to a Gorilla-Glass-5 backplate, there's also wireless charging onboard. That's a good thing, since the battery seems pretty puny, at just 3,000 milliamp hours, a 9% reduction compared to the G6. We'll see how the endurance actually holds up in part two, as well as how well the phone's video camera, its new super-bright-mode camera, and software does, and maybe by then we'll have some more details on pricing and availability. My early thought is that the G7 is the least surprising phone to come out of LG in quite some time. That's cool for somebody like me, who's mainly in it for the wide-angle camera, but for a company that hasn't exactly been lighting the world on fire by sticking to the playbook, at least in mobile, that doesn't fill me with hope. Of course, I'll reserve my final judgment for the full review. Be sure to subscribe to the MrMobile on YouTube so you don't miss it. This video was brought to you by Thrifter.

    "transcript": "(exciting music) - Sundar Pichai, you are the CEO of both Alphabet and Google. Welcome to \"Decoder.\" - Nilay, good to be here. - I am excited to talk to you. I feel like I talk to you every year at Google I/O, and we talk about all the things you've announced. There's a lot of things to talk about. There's a lot of AI news to talk about. As you know, I am particularly interested in the future of the web, so I really wanna talk about that with you. But I figured I would start with an easy one. Do you think language is the same as intelligence? - Wow, it's not an easy question. (Nilay laughing) I don't think I'm the expert on it. I think language does encode a lot of intelligence, probably more than, you know, people thought. Explains the successes of large language models to a great extent. But I think my intuition tells me, I mean, as humans, the way we consume information, I think there's a lot more to it than language alone. But I'd say language is a lot more than people think it is, yeah. - The reason I asked that question to start is I look at the announcements at I/O with AI and what you're doing, I look at your competitors with AI and what they're doing, and everything is very language heavy, right? It's LLMs that have really led to this explosion of interest in innovation and investment, and I wonder if the intelligence is increasing at the same rate as the facility with language. And I kind of don't see it, to be perfectly honest. I see computers getting much better at language, and actually in some cases, getting dumber, and I'm wondering if you see that same gap. - Yeah, it's a great question though. Part of the reason we made Gemini natively multimodal is so that, you know, it's trained, you know, with audio, video, text, images, and code, and you're beginning to see glimpses of it now, but it hasn't all actually made its way into products fully yet. So maybe the next cycle, when we have multimodality working on the input and output side and we are training models using all that, I think that'll encapsulate a lot more than just today, which is primarily text-based. So I think that continuum will shift as we, you know, take in a lot more information that way. So maybe there's more to come. - The reason I ask that is it feels like last year, you know, the tagline was, \"Bold, but responsible.\" That's Google's approach. - Yeah. - You said it again on stage this year. And then I look at our reactions to AI getting things wrong, and it seems like they're getting more and more tempered over time. I'll give you an example. In the demos you had yesterday, you showed multimodal video search of someone trying to fix a broken film camera, and the answer was just wrong, right? Like, sort of straightforwardly the answer that was highlighted in the video was, \"Just open the back of the film camera and jiggle it,\" and it's like, well, that would ruin all of your film, and no one who had an intelligent understanding of how that camera would just suggest that. - Now, ironically, I was talking to the team, you know, the team as part of making the video. They consulted with a bunch of subject matter experts who all reviewed the answer and thought it was okay. I understand the nuance. I agree with you. Obviously you don't wanna expose your film by taking it outside of a dark room. There are certain contexts in which it makes sense to do that. - Sure. - You know, if you don't wanna break the camera and if what you've taken is not that valuable. - Sure. - All right? (chuckles) It makes sense to do that. You know, it's a good example of, you are right, there is a lot of nuance in it, and, you know, part of what I hope Search serves to do is to, you know, gives you a lot more context around that answer, and allows people to explore it deeply. But I think, you know, these are the kind of things, you know, for us to keep getting better at. But to your earlier question, look, I think I do see the capability frontier continuing to move forward. I think we are a bit limited if we were just training on text data, but I think we are all making it more multimodal, so I see more opportunities there. - Let's talk about Search. This is the thing that I'm most interested in. I think this is the thing that is changing the most sort of in an abstract way. It's the thing that's the most exciting. - Yeah. - Right? You can ask a computer a question and it will just like happily tell you an answer. That feels new. Like I see the excitement around it. Yesterday you announced AI previews are coming to Search. That's an extension of what was called the Search Generative Experience, announcing a rollout to everyone in the United States. I would describe the reactions to that news from the people who make websites is fundamentally apocalyptic. The CEO of the News Media Alliance said to CNN, \"This will be catastrophic to our traffic.\" Another media CEO forwarded me a newsletter, and the headline was, \"This is a death blow to publishers.\" Were you expecting that kind of response to rolling out AI previews in Search? - Look, it's... I definitely, you know, I recall in 2010, you know, there were headlines that the web is dead, right? You know, and I've long worked on the web, obviously I deeply care about it. When the transition from desktop to mobile happened, there was a lot of concerns because people are like, \"Oh, it's a small screen. How will people read content?\" Like, why would they look at content? We had started introducing what we internally called Web Answers in 2014, which are featured snippets outside. So you had questions like that. I remain optimistic. Empirically what we are seeing, you know, throughout these years, I think human curiosity is boundless. - Yeah. - When people come, and it's something I think we have deeply understood in Search, more than any other company, I think we will differentiate ourselves in our approach even through this transition. I think as a company, we realized the value of this ecosystem, and it's symbiotic. If there isn't a rich ecosystem making unique and useful content, you know, what are you putting together and organizing, right? And so we feel it. I would say, through all these transitions, things have played out a bit differently. I think high quality content, users are looking for it. The counterintuitive part, which I think almost always plays out, is it's not a zero-sum game in terms of AI Overviews. People are responding very positively to it. It's one of the most positive changes I've seen in Search based on metrics we see. But people do jump off on it, and when you give context around it, they actually jump off it. It actually helps them understand, and so they engage with content underneath too. In fact, if you put content and links within AI Overviews, they get higher click through rates than if you put it outside of AI Overviews. - Yeah. - But I understand the sentiment, right? You know, it's a big change. You know, these are disruptive moments. AI is a big platform shift, and people are projecting out, and, you know, this is, people are putting a lot into creating content. It's their businesses, it's their... So I understand the perspective. So, you know, I'm not surprised. We are engaging with a lot of players both directly and indirectly, but I remain optimistic how it'll actually play out. But it's a good question, but happy to talk about it more. - So I think you know that I have this concept I call Google Zero. - Yeah. - Which is born of my own paranoia. Every refer that \"The Verge\" has ever had has gone up and then it's gone down, and Google is the last large scale refer of traffic on the web for almost every website now. And I can see that for a lot of sites, Google Zero is playing out. Their Google traffic has gone to zero, particularly independent sites that aren't part of some huge publishing conglomerate. So there's an air purifier blog that we cover called \"HouseFresh.\" There's a gaming site we cover called \"Retro Dodo.\" Both of these sites have said, \"Look, our Google traffic went to zero. Our businesses are doomed.\" Is that the right outcome here of all this? That the people who care so much about video games or air purifiers, that they actually started websites and made the content for the web, are the ones getting hurt the most in the platform shift? - No, look, I mean, it's always difficult to talk about individual cases, right? And like, you know, at the end of the day, we are trying to satisfy user expectations, and users are voting with their feet and right, so, and people are trying to figure out what's valuable to them. And we are doing it at scale. And, you know, I can't answer on the particular side. - But it's that thing where it's a bunch of small players are feeling the hurt, like loudly. Like they're saying it. Like, \"Our businesses are going away.\" And that's the thing you're saying, like, we're engaging, we're talking, but this thing that is happening very clearly- - But it's not clear to me that's a uniform trend. Like I have to look at data on and aggregate, right, so anecdotally, when people give spec- There are always times where when people have come in an area and said, \"Me as a specific site have done worse,\" but that may be a moment in which that's because it's like an individual restaurant coming and saying, \"I've started getting less customers this year.\" - Yeah. - \"People have stopped eating food,\" (Nilay laughing) or whatever it is, right? I mean, that's not true necessarily, right? Some other restaurant might have opened next door, which is doing very well, right? So it's tough to say. I think from our standpoint, when I look at historically, even over the past decade, you know, we have provided more traffic to the ecosystem and we've driven that growth, right, so that, you know, and you may be making a secondary point around small sites versus more aggregating sites, you know, which is the second point you're talking about. You know, ironically, there are times when we have done changes to actually send more traffic to the smallest sites. Some of those sites which complain a lot are the aggregators in the middle, right? So should the traffic be going to the restaurant which has created a website with their menus and stuff, or, you know, are people writing about these restaurants? These are deep questions. I'm not saying there's a right answer. - But you're about to flip over the whole apple cart, right? You're about to start answering some of these questions very directly, and where that content comes from in the future, I think you want the people who care the most to publish that information directly. - I agree. - To be the thing that you synthesize. - Yeah. - And the incentives for that seem to be getting lower and lower, on the web anyway. - Yeah, I feel it's the opposite. How do I...? You know, if anything, I feel like through AI Overviews, when you give people context, yes, there are times people come and all they want is a quick answer and they bounce back. But overall, when we look at user journeys, when you give the context, it also exposes people to areas branching off, jumping off points, and so they engage more. So actually, this is what drives growth over time. I look at like, desktop to mobile, questions were similar. In fact, I think it was a cover almost attempted to pull out saying the web is dead, and there was a Google Zero argument 10 years ago. But you yourself made the point that it's not an accident. I think we still remain as one of the largest referrers, 'cause we've cared about it deeply for a long, long time. I look at our journey, even the last one year through Search Generative Experience. I constantly, you know, found us prioritizing approaches which would send more traffic while meeting user expectations. You know, we think that through deeply, and we actually change our approach, and if there are areas where we feel like we fully haven't gotten it right, we are careful about rolling it there. But I think what's positively surprising us is that people engage more, and that will lead to more growth over time, I think, for high quality content. And there's a lot of debate about what's high quality content, and, you know, but I think I would hope that, you know, at least in my experience, you know, I value independent sources, I value smaller tanks, I want more authentic voices, and I think those are important attributes we are trying to constantly improve. - You mentioned that you think more people will click through links and AI previews. I think Liz, who runs Search, had a blog post making the same claim. There's no public data that says that this is true yet. Are you gonna release that data? Are you gonna show people that this is actually happening? - At an aggregate, I think people, I mean, we rely on this value of the ecosystem, right? If people over time on an aggregate don't see value, if the website owners don't see value coming back from Google, I think we'll pay a price. I think so. We have the right incentive structure. But obviously, look, I think we are careful about, there are a lot of individual variations and some of our users are choosing which way to go, and so I think that part is hard to sort out, but I do think we are committed at an aggregate level to do the right thing. - Yeah. I was reading some SEO community trade publications this morning responding to the changes, and one of the things that was pointed out was that in Search Console, it doesn't show you if the clicks are coming from a featured snippet or an AI preview or just a regular Google 10 blue links. Would you break that out? Would you commit to breaking it out so people can actually audit and verify and measure that the AI previews are sending out as much traffic as you say they are? - You know, I think it's a good question for the Search team if they think about this, you know, at a deeper level than, you know, I do. I think we're constantly trying to give more visibility in a way, but we also don't want people to, we want people to create the content that's good, and like we are trying to rank it and organize it. So I think there's a balance to be had. You know, the more we spec it out, then the more people design for that, so I think there's a trade off there. I think, so it's not clear to me what the right answer is. - Yeah, that trade off between what you spec out and say and what people make, I think that's been the story of the web for quite some time, and it had reached, I think, a steady state, whether you think that steady state was good or bad, but it was at least a steady state. Now that state is changing, right? It's like AI is obviously changing it. The 10 blue links model, the old steady state, very much based on an exchange, right? \"We're gonna let you index our content, we're gonna have featured snippets, we're gonna let you see all of our information. In return, you'll send us traffic.\" That formed the basis of what you might call a fair use argument. - Yeah. - Right? Google is gonna index this stuff. There's not gonna be a lot of payments in the middle. In the AI era, no one knows how that's gonna go, right? There are some major lawsuits happening. There are deals being made by Google, Open AI, for training data. Do you think it's appropriate for Google to start making more deals to pay for data to train search results? Because those AI snippets are not really the same as the 10 blue links or anything else you've done in the past. - Yeah, we have... I mean, it's a good question. To be very clear, there's a myth that Google Search has been 10 blue links for like... You know, I look at our mobile experience over many, many years, right, and we've had answers. We allow you to refine questions and so on. We've had featured snippets, right, you know, and so on. So, you know, the product has evolved significantly. I think, but having said that, you know, as a company, even as we look at AI, you know, we have done even, we have had showcase, we have done licensing deals. To the extent there is value, you know, we obviously think there is a case for values in the context of beneficial transformative use. Not gonna argue that with you given your background, but I think there are cases in which we will see dedicated incremental value to our models, and, you know, we'll be looking at partnerships to get at that. Yeah, so I do think we'll approach it that way. - Lemme ask this question in a different way, and I won't do too much fair use analysis with you, I promise, as much as I like doing it. You know, there are some news reports recently that OpenAI had trained its video generation product, Sora, on YouTube. How did you feel when you heard that news? - Look, we don't know the details. I think, you know, our YouTube team is following up and trying to understand. Look, we have terms and conditions, right, and we would expect people to abide by those terms and conditions, right? And so I think when you build a product, and so that's how I felt about it, right, you know? - So you felt like they had broken your terms and conditions, or potentially, or if they had, that wouldn't have been appropriate. - That's right. Yeah, that's right. - The reason I asked that question, which is a much more emotional question, is, okay, maybe that's not appropriate. And, you know, what OpenAI has said, whatever they've said is essentially on the order of, \"We've trained on publicly available information,\" which means we found it on the web. Most people don't get to make that deal, right? They don't have a YouTube team of licensing professionals who can say, \"We had terms and conditions.\" They don't even have terms and conditions. They're just putting their stuff on the internet. Do you understand why emotionally there's the reaction to AI from the creative community that it feels the same way as you might have felt about OpenAI training on YouTube? - Absolutely. Look, I mean, I think website owners or content creators or artists, you know, I can understand how emotional a transformation this is, and I think part of the reason you saw even through Google I/O when we're working on products like music generation, we have really taken an approach by which we are working first to make tools for artists. We haven't put a general purpose tool out there for anyone to create songs, right? So the way we have taken that approach in many of these cases is to put the creator community as much at the center of it as possible. We've long done that with YouTube, and through it all, I think we are trying to figure out what are the right ways to approach this. - Yeah. - But it is a transformative moment as well, and, you know, there are other players in this. We are not the only player in the ecosystem. We are not the only player in the ecosystem, but to your earlier question, yes, I understand people's emotions through it. You know, I definitely am very empathetic to how people are perceiving this moment. - Because they feel like it's a taking, right? That they put work on the internet and the big companies are coming, they're taking it for free, and then they're making products that you're charging 20 bucks a month for, or that will lift their creative work and remix it for other people. And the thing that makes it feel like a taking is very little value accrues back to them. And that's really the thing I'm asking about is how do you bring value back to them? How do you bring incentives back to the small creator, the independent business, that's saying, \"Look, this feels like a taking\"? - I mean, look, the whole reason we have spent, I think we've been successful on platforms like YouTube is we've worked hard to answer this question well, right? And so you'll continue to see us dig deep about how to do this well, and I think the players who end up doing better here will have more winning strategies over time. I genuinely believe that. And, you know, I think across everything we do, you know, we have to sort that out. Anytime you're running a platform, I think it's the basis on which you can build a sustainable long-term platform. So I view, you know, through this AI moment, over time there'll be players who will do better by the content creators which support their platforms, and whoever does it better will emerge as the winners. I think that, you know, I believe that to be a tenet, right, in these things over time. - Yeah, one thing that I think is really interesting about the YouTube comparison in particular, it's been described to me many times that YouTube is a licensing business, right? You license a lot of content from the creators. You obviously pay them back in terms of the advertising model there. The music industry has a huge licensing business with YouTube. It is an existential relationship, I think for both sides. Susan Wojcicki used to describe YouTube as a music service, which I think confused everyone until you looked at the data. Universal Music is mad about AI on YouTube. YouTube reacts, right? They like build a bunch of tools. They write a constitution about what AI will do and will not do. People are mad about Search Generative Experience or AI previews on the web. Google doesn't react the same way, and I'm wondering if you can square that circle. - It's so far from reality. - You think so? - That's so far from reality, right? I mean, we have taken, I look at other players, you know, how they've approached- - I mean, you're talking about Open AI, which is just out there takin' stuff, right? - Look, in general, when you look at how we have approached Search Generative Experience, even through a moment like this, the time we have taken to test, iterate, prioritize approaches, and the way we've done it over the years, I would say, you know, I definitely disagree with the notion we don't listen, right? So we deeply care. We listen. Not everything we do, you know, people may agree. When you're running an ecosystem, you know, you are balancing across different needs. But I would definitely think, and I hope you always do, because I think that's the essence of what makes a product successful. - Yeah. Lemme talk about the other side of this. So there's Search, and people are gonna game Search, and that's always gonna happen, and that's a chicken/egg problem. The other thing that I see is happening is the web is being flooded with AI content. There was an example a few months ago where some unsavory SEO character said, \"Here's this thing I just did. I stole a bunch of traffic from a competitor. I copied their site map, I fed it into an AI, and had it generate me copy for a website that matched their site map. I put up this website, and I stole a bunch of traffic from that website, my competitor.\" I think that's a bad outcome. I don't think we want to incentivize that in any way, shape, or form. That's gonna happen at scale, right? And more and more of the internet that we experience will be synthetic in some important way. How do you, on the one hand, build the systems that create the synthetic content for people, and on the other hand, rank it so that you're only getting the best stuff? Because at some point, the defining line for a lot of people is, \"I want stuff made by human and not stuff made by an AI.\" - I think there are multiple parts to your question, right? So one, how do we sift through high quality from low quality. I'm like, I literally view that as our mission statement. It's, you know, and it is what has defined Search over many, many years. I actually think people underestimate the pro- It gets, you know, anytime you have these disruptive platform shifts, you know, you're gonna go through a phase like this. I have seen that teams invest so much, our entire Search quality teams, you know, been spending the last year, right, gearing up our ranking systems, et cetera, to better get at what is high quality content. If I think the next decade, people who can do that better, who can sift through that, I think will win out. I think you're right in your assessment that, you know, people will value human-created experiences. I hope the data bears that out. And, you know, we have to be careful every time there's a new technology. There are old filmmakers, if you go and talk about CGI in films, they're gonna react very emotionally. - Yeah. - Right? And there are still esteemed filmmakers who never use CGI in films, but then there are people who use it and produce great films, right? And so I think you can't just say anything with AI. You know, you may be using AI to lay out, you know, enhance video effects in your video, et cetera. But I agree with you. I think using AI to produce en masse content without adding any value, et cetera, I don't think it's what users are looking for. - Yeah. - Right? But there is a big continuum, and, you know, over time users are adapting. We are trying hard to make sure we do it in a responsible way, but also listening to what users actually find as high quality versus not, and trying to get that balance right, right? And that continuum will look different a few years out than it is today. But I think I view it as the essence of what Search quality is, and do I feel confident we will be able to approach it better than others? Yes. Right? And I think that's what defines the work we do. - For the listener, these have been a lot of subtle shots at OpenAI today. Can I put this into practice by showing you a search? I actually just did this search. It is a search for best Chromebook. As you know, I once bought my mother a Chromebook Pixel. - I remember. - It's one of my favorite tech purchases of all time. So this is a search of best Chromebook. I'm gonna hit \"generate\" at the top. It's gonna generate the answer, and then I'm gonna do something terrifying, which is I'm gonna hand my phone to the CEO of Google. This is my personal phone. - Yeah. - Don't dig through it. So you look at that, and, you know, the, it's the same generation that I've seen earlier. I ask them for best Chromebook, and it says, \"Here's some stuff you might think of.\" And then you scroll, and it's some Chromebooks. It doesn't say whether they're the best Chromebooks. And then it's a bunch of headlines. Some of it's like \"Verge\" headlines, which are like, \"Here are some best Chromebooks.\" That feels like the exact kind of thing that an AI-generated search could answer in a better way. Like, do you think that's a good experience today? Is that a waypoint, or is that the destination? - I think, look, you're showing me a query in which we didn't automatically generate the AI Overview. - Well, there was a button that said, \"Do you wanna do that?\" so. - But that's... Let me push back, right? - Okay. There's an important differentiation, right? There's a reason we are giving a view without the generated AI Overview. And as a user, you are initiating an action, right? So we are respecting the user intent there. And when I scroll it, I see Chromebooks. I also see a whole set of links, which I can go, which tell me all the ways you can think about Chromebooks. - Yeah. - You know, so I see a lot of links. So we both didn't show an AI Overview in this case. As a user, you're generating the follow-up question. I think it's right that we respect the user intent. - [Nilay] Yeah. - If you don't do that, right, people will go somewhere else too, right? I think, so, you know- - But I'm saying the answer to the question, I did not write, \"What is the best Chromebook?\" I just wrote \"Best Chromebook.\" The answer, a thing that identifies itself as an answer is not on that page. And the leap to, I had to push the button to Google pushes the button for me, and then says what it believes to be the answer is very small. And I'm wondering if you think a page like that today is, that is the destination of the Search experience, or if this is a waypoint, and you can see a future better version of that experience. - Oh, I'll give you your phone back. - Please. - I'm tempted to check email right now out of habit. Look, but, you know, I think the direction of how these things will go, you know, it's fully tough to predict, you know? You know, users keep evolving, right? It's a more dynamic moment than ever. We are testing all of this, right? And like, you know, and this is a case where we didn't trigger the AI Overview because we felt like our AI Overview is not necessarily the first experience we wanna provide for that query, because what's underlying is maybe a better first look at the user. - Yeah. - Right? And those are all quality trade offs we are making. But if the user is asking for a summary, right, we are summarizing and giving links. I think that seems like a reasonable direction to me. - Yeah. Can I show you? I'll show you another one. - Yeah. - I'll show you another one where it did expand automatically. This one I only have screenshots for. So this is Dave Lee from \"Bloomberg\" did a search. He got an AI Overview, and he just searched for \"JetBlue Mint lounge SFO,\" and it just says the answer, which I think is fine, and that's the answer. If you swipe one over, I cannot believe I'm letting the CEO of Google swipe on my camera roll, but if you swipe one over, you see where it pulled from. You see the site it pulled from. It is a word for word rewrite of that site. I mean this is the thing I'm getting at, right, like. - Sorry. You're saying...? - The AI-generated preview of that answer, if you just look at where it came from, it is almost the same sentence that exists on the site, on the source of it. That's what I mean. It's at some point that the better experience is the AI preview, and it's just the thing that exists on all the sites underneath it. It's the same information. - In my experience, and that's not what users... Look, the thing with Search, we handle billions of queries. You can absolutely find a query and hand it to me and say, \"Could we have done better on that query?\" - Yeah. - Yes. You know, for sure. But when I look across, in many cases, part of what is making people respond positively to AI Overviews is the summary we are providing clearly adds value, helps them look at things they may not have otherwise thought about. If you're adding value at that level, I think people notice it over time, right? And I think that's the bar you're trying to meet. And our data would show, over 25 years, if you aren't doing something which users find valuable or enjoyable, they let us know right away. - Yeah. - Over and over again we see that. And through this transition, everything is the opposite. - Yeah. - Right? It's one of the biggest quality improvements we are driving in our product. People are valuing this experience. So, you know, so I think I would place a lot of... You know, I think there's a general presumption that people don't know what they are doing. - Yeah. - Which I disagree with strongly. Like, you know, people who use Google are savvy. They understand. And, you know, and so like to me, you know, I can give plenty of examples where I've used AI Overviews as a user. I'm like, \"Oh, this is giving context. Oh, maybe there are this dimensions I didn't even think in my original query,\" right? How do I expand upon it and look at it? - Yeah. You've made oblique mention to OpenAI a few times, I think. - I actually haven't. Like, I think- - You keep saying others. There's one other big competitor that is I think a little more- - No, you're putting words in the mouth, but that's okay. - Yeah, okay. Well, I would say I saw OpenAI's demo the other day of GPT-4o (Omni). It looked a lot like the demos you gave at I/O, right? This idea of multimodal search, the idea that you have this like character you can talk to. But you had GEMS, which are the same kind of idea. It feels like there's a race to get to kind of the same outcome for a Search-like experience or an Agent-like experience. Do you feel the pressure from that competition? - Oh, I mean, this is no different from Siri and Alexa, and like, you know, we worked in an industry. I think when you're working in the technology industry, I think there is relentless innovation, right? You know, we felt a few years ago, all of us building voice assistants, you could have asked the same version of this question, right? And what was Alexa trying to do, and what was Siri trying to do? So I think it's a natural extension of that. I think you have a new technology now, and it's evolving rapidly. Do I feel...? You know, I felt like it was a good week for technology. There was a lot of innovation, I felt, on Monday and Tuesday and so on. That's how I feel. And I think it's going to be that way for a while. For a while. I'd rather have it that way. You know, you'd rather be in a place where the underlying technology is evolving, which means you can radically improve your experiences which you're putting out. I'd rather have that any time than a static phase in which you feel like, you know, you're not able to move forward fast. I think a lot of us have had this vision for what a powerful assistant can be, but we were held back by the underlying technology not being able to, you know, serve that goal. - [Nilay] Yeah. - I think we have a technology which is better able to serve that. That's why you're seeing the progress again. So I think that's exciting. To me, I look at it and say, \"We can actually make Google Assistant a whole lot better.\" You're seeing visions of that with Project Astra, right? You know, it's incredibly magical to me when I use it. So, you know, so I'm very excited by it. - Yeah, and this brings me back to the first question I asked, right? Language versus intelligence. - Yeah. - To make these products, I think you need a core level of intelligence. Do you have in your head a measure of, \"This is when it's gonna be good enough. I can trust this\"? On all of your demo slides, on all of OpenAI's demo slides, there's a disclaimer that says, \"Check this info.\" And to me it's ready when you don't need that anymore, right? You didn't have \"Check this info\" at the bottom of the 10 blue links. You didn't have \"Check this info\" at the bottom of featured snippets necessarily. - You're getting at a deeper point where hallucination is still an unsolved problem right now. In some ways it's a inherent feature. It's what makes these models very creative, right? You know, it's why it can immediately write a poem about Thomas Jefferson in the style of Nilay. It can do that, right? It's incredibly creative. But, you know, LLMs aren't necessarily the best approach to always get at factuality, right, which is part of why I feel excited about Search, because in Search we are bringing LLMs in a way, but we are grounding it with all the work we do in Search and laying it with enough context. I think we can deliver a better experience from that perspective. But I think the reason you're seeing those disclaimers is because of the inherent nature, right? There are still times it's gonna get it wrong. - Yeah. - But I don't think I would look at that and underestimate how useful it can be at the same time. I think that would be a wrong way to think about it. Google Lens is a good example, right? When we did Google Lens first, when we put it out, it would get, you know, it didn't recognize all objects well, but the curve year on year has been pretty dramatic, and users are using it more and more. We get billions of queries now. We've had billions of queries now with Google Lens. It's because, you know, the underlying image recognition, paired with our knowledge entity understanding has dramatically expanded over time. So I would view it as a continuum, right, and I think, again, I go back to this saying, users vote with their feet, right? Fewer people use Lens in the first year. We also didn't put it everywhere, because we realized the limitations of the product. - When you talk to the DeepMind, Google Brain team, is there on the roadmap a solution to the hallucination problem? - It's Google DeepMind, you know? But are we making progress? Yes, we are. We have definitely made progress, you know, when we look at metrics on factuality year on year, so we are all making it better, but it's not solved. Are there interesting ideas and approaches which they are working on? Yes. You know, yes, but time will tell, right? You know, but I would view it as LLMs are an aspect of AI. Right? You know, we are working on AI in a much broader way. But it's an area where I think we are all working definitely to drive more progress. - All right, last question. I think it's the theme of this conversation. Five years from now, this technology, the paradigm shift will be through, it feels like. What does the best version of the web look like for you five years from now? - I hope the web is much richer in terms of modality. I think today I feel like the way humans consume information, you know, is still not fully encapsulated in the web. Today things exist in very different ways, right? You have webpages, you have YouTube, et cetera, but over time, I hope the web is much more multimodal, it's much more richer, much more interactive, it is a lot more stateful, which it's not today. So, you know, I view it as, while fully acknowledging the point, people may use AI to generate a lot of spam, I also feel every time there's a new wave of technology, people quite don't know how to use it. - Yeah. - When mobile came, everyone took webpages and like shouted into mobile applications. Then later people evolved really native mobile applications. So the way people use AI to actually solve new things, new use cases, et cetera, is yet to come, so when that happens I think the web will be much, much richer too. So I think, you know, you being dynamically composing a UI in a way that makes sense for you, right? And different people have different needs, right? But today, you know, you're not dynamically composing that UI. - Yeah. - AI can help you do that over time. It can also do it badly and wrongly, and people can use it shallowly. But there will be entrepreneurs who figure out an extraordinarily good way to do it, and out of it there'll be great new things to come. So yeah. - Google creates a lot of incentives for development on the web through Search, through Chrome, through everything that you do. - Yeah. - How do you make sure those incentives are aligned toward those goals? Because I think maybe the biggest thing here is that the web ecosystem is in a moment of change, and Google has a lot of trust to build and rebuild. How do you think about making sure those incentives point at the right goals? - Look, not everything is in Google's control. I wish I could influence how. What is the single toughest experience when I go to websites today? As a user, you can never have... You have a lot of cookie dialogues to accept, et cetera. Right? So I would argue there are many things outside. You can go poll 100 users, right, and like, you know? But, you know, the incentives we would like to create, look, I think, and there's a complex question, which is how do you reward originality, creativity, independent voice, at whatever scale at which you're able to do, and, you know, give a chance for that to thrive in this content ecosystem we create, right? And that's what I think about. That's what the Search team thinks about. But I think it's an important principle, and I think it'll be important for the web and important for us as a company. - That's great. Well, Sundar, thank you so much for the time. Thank you for being on \"Decoder.\" - Thanks. Thanks, Nilay. Greatly enjoyed it. - That was great. - I appreciate it. (exciting music)",

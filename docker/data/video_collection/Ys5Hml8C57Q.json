    "transcript": "so you don't need a fancy camera in order to entice your creativity for video or photography all you need is the realization that working with what you've got well actually get you to the result better in terms of being satisfied with your photography or anything capture and so today's video is about smartphone photography versus a real camera photography and why I would say to just avoid you know the fancy stuff and just keep shooting with your smartphone now with my most recent trip to Brazil all the pictures you're about to see were captured with the oneplus 5 with some creative editing too but still I was blown away at what this phone was able to capture and it's not about the oneplus 5 camera it's about any camera that is on your smartphone so start shooting and don't be thinking about having this around your neck just don't be missing out of hardware when you have fantastic tools at your disposal already all right so I hope you enjoyed those pictures but now it's time to see if you can tell the difference between me oneplus 5t portrait note vs. something that is equivalent in focal length and aperture on the photography side of things so let me show you some pictures right after this so it was kind of a love at first sight you know there's really nothing like this exterior I love the metallic color the tinted glass panel the RGB fans at the front it's basically a see-through case and who doesn't love that your graphics card can go vertical the top is radiator friendly and the right side is so unique when exposed thanks to these cable covers so you can show off everything you've got with the aged 500 P white Coolermaster check it out in description below alright so let's quickly talk about the gear for the smartphone I'm using the 1 plus 5t sandstone white edition because it has this new coating that this far less slippery versus the aluminum bodies on early models making it easier to handle while I'm taking pictures without needing incase but it's not as textured as the actual stands don't case and by the way who doesn't love an accent I absolutely love this red alert slider that I'm sure many will appreciate now for the camera hardware like most smartphones today we have a dual shooter so a 16 megapixel and 20 megapixel sensor and they work together to create the depth mapping and that whole blur effect and it's a 27 millimeter lens with an F 1.7 aperture while for the fancy camera I decided to go with a Fuji XT20 because it's super compact it's got a fantastic sensor interchangeable lenses and the image quality and the color out it's Fuji is fantastic and for the lens I have the 23 millimeter F 2.0 lens which is a 35 mm water equivalent in full-frame and so the Fuji is slightly more zoomed in versus the smartphone but I accommodate by stepping back a little bit to acquire an almost identical composition so now let's go outside and take some shots now obviously portability is kind of important so with the fancy you have to keep around your neck you cannot stuff it in your pants pocket and you just have to be cautious when using this thing on the street when this is a lot more discreet you put it in your pants pocket forget about it take it out when you take a shot now the beauty of smartphone photography is the whole point and truth approach everything is simplified your exposure is automatic tap to focus and all the pictures are there for you to share immediately so let's put the fancy camera on automatic so all the settings are handled by the camera and they're taken out from the users experience to see what the JPEG versus smartphone quality looks like so let's start with a shot of the sky so both of them acquire proper exposure but the Fuji has different character in their colour rendition while the smartphone has those nice vibrant blues of the sky both of them are good very ready for social media sharing for this next shot I use the portrait mode on the 5T and it does a really good job of making sure that I'm cut out and that subject isolation and blurring out the background properly however the dynamic range is better on the Fuji and the fine detail is a lot better on the larger sensor so that is kind of the the advantage if you want to really zoom in or like punching digitally to expand your footage and maneuver your composition whereas with the 5T it really falls apart in the fine details when you try to get really close to the image for this next shot I'm still using the portrait mode on the 5T and it does a really good job again and isolating that camera from the background with little hiccups here and there so you can you can definitely see those artifacting around the edges but if you're sharing this on social media most likely people are gonna be zooming in and so you can't really tell the difference between the two shots aside from better dynamic range and detail of the few G for this next shot on my feet the color and vibrancy is a bit higher on the 5T and it's because I'm using the classic chrome color preset on the few G because I think it has a lot more character but as you can see here with this like boring composition the 5T wins for this next shot of the tree bark the detail is amazing in both but you can tell which one is the fancy camera because of that additional depth of field and character versus the you know the 5T just feels like a standard point-and-shoot although I will say that the depth of field it creates behind the tree is very nice and natural this is not in the portrait mode and so this is standard lens and because I'm close to the subject it allows me to isolate it from the background for this next shot of the breakfast plate you can see the Fuji has a lot more color definition and contrast within its shot versus the 5T looks a bit you know kind of washed out but it's an easy fix with a little contrast curve now the one thing that really impressed me was how is similar the auto white balance was on both cameras sure we had more contrast and more detail in a few G but the 5T performed very well in its own right in both portrait mode and standard detail stuff now obviously the advantage with the larger sensor is being able to create that depth of field and subject isolation especially with the fast lines like an f2 however camera is becoming so good in developing their own portrait mode and using software to determine what's in focus and what's in the background however the fancy camera wins in dynamic range preserving a lot more information in those bright areas but of course this is a tough shot for the smartphone sensor because I'm in the shade and the background is super bright so it's trying to compensate to make sure that the whole scene is balanced again here we get more dynamic range and detail from the fancy camera but it is backlit with the harsh sunlight and the 5T does an okay job with those blur edges while preserving excellent color for the skin and the environment now for this next shot I'm super impressed by the edge detection on the smartphone around the furry hood and which is much more accurate than before and comparing the side-by-side made me realize just how natural this artificial blur is on a smartphone with an appropriate out-of-focus gradient so it doesn't simply cut out the subject and blur everything behind it but we have a more realistic blurriness with the distance and I think one of the driving forces behind people wanting a fancy camera is because of that optical depth of field which is created through the glass and not through AI but portrait mode is becoming so good that I love shooting people with it but even shooting is still subject it turns out to be just as good so for example in this shot the photos almost look identical and the 5T actually renders those light reflections beautifully to really sell the effect you probably cannot tell which is which if I posted them without telling you but you have to be careful with reflections since they're not recognized by the distance and you can tell this is a portrait mode photo from the smartphone but shooting through glass delivers awesome results because reflections get blurred out and help to hide any edge imperfections in portrait mode also works really well for close-ups actually better than my fancy camera and compatible end results in the controlled environment in terms of color and exposure when that occasional hiccup around more complicated areas now the floor on this one is very similar between the two but you can tell which one is the smartphone because of the blow now at highlights so that seems to be the major disadvantage the dynamic range needs to improve to really sell the effect and the pixel to camera right now has done this right but with more aggressive edge detection which is less natural but we get that beautiful dynamic range and here are some more examples of the 5T in portrait mode I think this is an outstanding direction to encourage smartphone photography you don't need a fancy camera to have a good time now what about the convenience of capture - sharing with the smartphone is instantaneous all your images are here and all your social platforms are on there - you want to apply some Instagram filter be my guest but with the camera you have to offload the images from the SD card maybe process them in some way choose your best one and only then upload it however majority of cameras now also have Wi-Fi capability allowing you to connect the smartphone to the camera and then instantaneously get all your photos directly on your smartphone which makes the whole process from the fancy camera of capturing and sharing a lot easier now what if you want to tinker with all your settings manually so majority of smartphones have that as pro mode and of course it's a bit easier to handle on the fancy camera because you don't have to it's not software based it's all just like little dials and buttons on the body itself and if you want to take your photography to the next level you can always edit your photos I use Snapseed it's free and it's powerful I generally just do brighten it up bring out some color with the vibrancy and contrast sliders I warm it up so it's a three easy step to really give your photos a little extra pop and for people who want to take their fancy camera photography to the next level always shooting raw obviously allows you to capture so much more information and then edit that in post-production so for example in these shots I really overexposed I seen just to see how much I can push the raw files and the amount of detail I was able to recover is just incredible so that gives you a little indication on how raw workflow is so much more powerful but that workflow in Photoshop or Lightroom or any other software is intensive on your on your computer and it's also time consuming here's a fun fact a single photo out of this is 50 megabytes in RAW so imagine I take 20 pictures that's one gigabyte of storage on my computer and so you can either shoot in like a smart way where you delete things you're not going to be using and so for like everyday life you're using your smart phone to capture your stuff and then when you want to capture like wallpaper printing material then the fancy camera it might come out now if you are going the fancy camera around I will give you one advice and that is to buy one lens that means you learn the body you learn the characteristics of your lens and how far you have to be away from your subject and Composition details and all that stuff that way you can have a good time and move your feet in order to like capture your shot kind of like you do with a smartphone because most of them have a single camera only then you coarser avoid pro gaming headset is comfortable stylish in different colors delivers fantastic wireless performance even for competitive gaming with an all-new microphone for clear communications check out the void Pro Wireless or wired in the description below alright so I would love to see your favorite smartphone captures share them on Twitter @hardwarecanucks I'm Dmitry you don't need a fancy camera take good pictures and enjoy doing so hopefully this has been the message across this video thanks so much for watching we'll see you in the next video",

    "transcript": "well hello good people first day of games come it's all about the media it's actually quite nice and grew me over here last time I was here was completely packed with people but right now it's pretty chill we're going around the show floor and trying to find some custom 20 series new cards from Nvidia the RTX series by UI check out the explained video right over here alright visiting Horace no custom cards here only 10 series so the show floor is only open to the media right now and is almost completely packed tomorrow is gonna be crazy but that's I see the ROG booth let's go check it out hopefully they have an awesome card for us alright so it is too awesome to see the rtx 2080 strict submission 20% larger surface area on the cooler versus last generation it is now a 2.7 a small cards instead of 2.5 so it's like a beefier cooler I guess that makes sense to lose that RTX chip awesome could they see a cards on the show floor and that let's go play some games the awesome thing about Gamescom are these giant statues of games so you are not here just to play but everyone has a bit of cosplay and like a little bit so much more energy about games like a look at this giant tank behind me oh man I see EVGA let's go check out the new cards they're all on display so evj is showing off three new cards that check out the rtx 2080 EC first so this one you can see the shroud is slightly transparent it's not plastic it's this PVC material so it is durable it's not flexible now the cool thing about the transparency is that you can customize you RTX GPU with these trims they call them so they're available in black red and white and carbon later on so you can customize your car to look the way you want based on know the color scheme which is pretty awesome the XE is also double slot GPU unlike the others so it's pretty compact 2080 and 2080 TI awesome stuff moving on to the XC2 so this one's a slightly wider much bigger heatsink this is the 2.7 slot GPU has all the same features the cool thing about this plan is that it has full EVGA logo on the fans which actually reduced the noise levels of the GPU so the car is running quieter massive heat sink over here so no problem in cooling something like this and then the FTW 3 so FTW 3 is probably going to be the most popular out of this lineup because it's got three fans massive heatsink so this is uh I think it's a triple small GPU yes it is also features the same transparent design on the shroud so you can customize the actual law trims on the interior so the cool thing about this one is that we also have this aluminum shield that you can put on top it looks awesome customize the GPU a little bit more so it's kind of cool how EVGA is branching out into this customization element so not only we have the improvement on the heatsink because it is 14% cooler and 19% quieter than previous generation but we also have this others no customization stuff that we weren't seeing before they also have the new boxes so once you receive a card you pull off the lid it's a nice low surprise waiting inside and new software UI so not only is the bit cleaner they're also new features like actually setting the throttling frequency so if the card is reaching a certain certain temperature you can actually set the frequency clock to how much it will down the clock and we also have the full RGB customization controls not only for the cards but also for the SLI bridge which is pretty cool something that we weren't able to control before also I will say the backplate is a new design looks actually pretty sweet and the whole transparency on the shroud allows for that RGB illumination to shine right through so it's not going to be in certain sections and actually will or supposed to eliminate the entire face of the card which is going to look pretty sweet alright so those are the new RTX cards from a VGA the XC XC2 and the FTW3 for the rtx 2080 and 2080 ti I am personally excited for the 2080 like the dual slot because it's compact obviously is gonna have a lot of power but the FTW3 2080 ti is most likely going to be like that the king of the stuff so you can overclock that thing and it looks absolutely awesome the additional customization options are pretty cool but let us know which card you'd like us to review first and of course Jacob will try to deliver well well well what's interesting is that we found an msi card but we are told but how the board partners is that none of them are supposed to be running and that card is running so this thing is a pretty gigantic GPU but of course they have multiple variations of that one I think that was the gaming trio X gaming extra or something like that but full of RGB goodness the heatsink is absolutely massive and yeah you need a giant case to dominate their new rtx lineup Wow so the things that you see at Gamescom cards heads and balls either you games come you do you alright good people so that is our games come coverage it's an exciting place to be because we get to see so many demos of the games that we can you know test and play out for a little bit and it's actually pretty awesome to actually have this such a significant hardware launch at Gamescom and it kind of makes sense because you know Jensen spent like 90 percent of presentation talking about rate racing that will be most likely port to games with this whole rtx platform an ecosystem later on so they are really closely linked together I was hoping for more brand partners to showcase their rtx cards but it's good to see EVGA in full force asus cards and one two cards from msi but yeah i'm definitely excited to see more on September 20th when the whole rtx 20 series launches now a lot of you have expressed your skepticism about gaming performance which we are about to receive tomorrow so a lot of the information is still under NDA but as soon as we are able to speak about the performance and reveal the true colors of this whole rtx lineup of course you'll hear that from us so thanks much for watching I'm Dimitri from games come and we'll see you and be",

    "transcript": "- Hey guys, this is the bird-killing death ray. Now, that may sound incredibly sensational, but it's true. Recently, I was driving from here in L.A. to Las Vegas. So right before I got to the Nevada border, I saw something a little bit unusual, and by unusual I mean three incredibly bright towers being lit by thousands and thousands of mirrors in the desert. But what exactly is going on? The wonderfully named Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System is a 392 megawatt power plant which is spread across 3,500 acres or five square miles. This provides power to 140,000 homes across California and with a price tag of $2.2 billion, partially funded by Google, this was a massive endeavor to build. Well at first glance, it might look like a traditional solar farm, but instead of having solar panels, it has thousands and thousands of mirrors which harvest the sun's energy in a very different way. I'll give you a hint, it involves a death ray. A traditional solar panel will use what is known as a photovoltaic cell to turn the energy from the sun into actual electricity which then can be fed into the grid and used to watch YouTube videos. What Ivanpah really is is what's known as a concentrated solar power plant. Even though it does look like a solar farm at first glance, it's actually much closer to a traditional power plant. The way it works is that tens of thousands of mirrors are placed in a concentric circle to focus sunlight onto a receiver which is on top of a 40-story-tall tower. All that sunlight focused on the receiver is enough to bring the temperature to between 500 to 1000 degrees fahrenheit. One of the advantages of a CSP array over traditional solar panels, is that it will continue to work even after the sun goes down. Because this thing gets so hot, the actual generator itself is able to continue to make electricity for about ten hours or so after the sun goes down. While it might look crazy to have thousands and thousands of mirrors in the middle of the desert trying to catch some towers on fire, but at least on paper the science backs it up. It combines a lot of the best aspects from various different types of power plants and puts into a nice environmentally-friendly package. Unless you count the birds. A lot of birds die because it's a solar death ray, but if you can look past the whole death ray thing, it's not crazy. Okay, who am I kidding? It's actually kinda crazy, but it's cool. At Ivanpah alone, an estimated 6,000 birds die every single year thanks to immolation, aka they're caught on fire as they fly through the giant death ray. Look, okay look, I'm done. I'm done with the nerd talk. This thing is crazy. It's a death ray in the middle of the desert. If you played Fallout, you know what I'm talking about. A bunch of bird are getting lit on fire as they fly through the sky. That's what you clicked on, not to hear a bunch of specs about how the Ivanpah plant generates 1.21 gigawatts of bird-killing power. To give you an idea of just how crazy this is, lava will typically flow at around 850 degrees fahrenheit. The air around the actual towers where it's most concentrated can reach 1000 degrees fahrenheit. So you can imagine what happens when a bird flies through that. It's not exactly pretty. All this means is that the Ivanpah team has had to get really creative with how they try to minimize all the birds dying on their giant solar death ray. So some of the things they've done is switch out all the light bulbs in the facility for LEDs to attract fewer bugs. They've also recalibrated the HELIOs to make the lightbeams slightly more concentrated so that hopefully fewer birds fly through the death ray path. I'm just gonna keep saying death ray 'cause it's a death ray. Death ray. They've even installed speakers which blast high-pitched screeching noises to keep birds away, but still, they keep coming. (sighs) This just sounds like something out of, like, a really bad spy movie. Now to be fair, this actually doesn't kill that many more birds than a lot of other types of energy such as natural gas as well as wind. What it does do, is kill a lot of birds by lighting them on fire in the air as opposed to them dying of, like, cancer or something, which is equally sad, but much less dramatic. With all of this in mind, is this even something worth pursuing? Well, there are a lot of cons to CSPs. Not only do you have a ton of moving parts with all these mirrors which have to attract the sun, but there have also been some issues, like for example, the Ivanpah plant back in 2016, some of the mirrors weren't quite properly aligned and caught one of the towers on fire. The biggest issues with CSPs though is that they actually just don't generate that much electricity. Sure, it is going to power quite a few homes, but compared to a lot of other sources, such as say a dam, it's not even going to be close. The Ivanpah plant doesn't even qualify in the top 50 biggest power plants in the United States. So you know, if you wanna go build a solar death ray in the desert, by all means, be my guest. If you wanna actually generate a lot of electricity, go buy some solar panels or, you know, a windmill, or, I don't know, something else that doesn't kill a bunch of birds every day.",

    "transcript": "(grunt) (rustling) - Okay, I made it. Hi. This is going to be an interesting video, it's part unboxing video . I wanted to talk about wireless accessories for your new phone. (rustling) And it's worked out perfect, because, almost all the wireless stuff I use for my phone and the charge is, (rustling) (thunk) from Mofi, and holy moly is this heavy. I'm not even sure what's in here. They've been releasing a lot of wireless products in the past couple of years, so now, I feel like since the iPhone, starting with, I guess the last years iPhone, the iPhone ten, has wireless charging enabled. Most phones nowadays either have it, or most phones going foreword will have it. There's, oh my gosh, no way, this is so cool. Wow, this is like a little dresser. There's drawers. (rustling) I'm so excited to open this up, a huge thank you to Mofi for partnering with me on this video. I am so excited to show you some of their Charge Stream products. Oh, I want to be surprised. I don't like to know what's inside of something before I open it up. Also, in case your interested, if you did decide to get anything from the Charge Stream line from Mofi there is a discount code you can use that iJustine you can use for 20% off any of the Charge Stream products. Anything we are going through here, for you, my friends. Let's see in the top drawer. (drawer slides) Oh! The first thing that we have is the Charge Stream. This is the powerstation wireless and powerstation wireless XL. So most of the time I usually carry one of these around, but you always need a cable. So this has USB-A and a USB-C, but the best thing about it you don't even need a cable if you have wireless charging. (clunk) So the larger brick will give you 48 hours of battery life, and the smaller one will give you 34. (click) (sliding) This is something that actually I do not have yet, this is a wireless charger for your car. Oh yeah, I'm putting this in my car immediately. The one I have now is not a charger, but it does attach to the vent, and my phone, it slips down and hit's the restart buttons, and then it keeps calling the emgerency services. (sliding) Oh, so I have one of these when they first came out, this has Apple fast charge, and also will also do Samsung fast charge. I love these charging pads. I have them all around my house. I have them at my desk, I have them by nightstand, I have some downstairs for guests and they perfect because they are so small. It kinda just look like coffee cup coasters, which I definitely wouldn't recommend putting your coffee on it, but if you wanted to, you can, who am I to tell you what to do? Just pops right on there, like so, and charges your phone. They also have these in white. Let's see if they, they don't have a picture, but this is one of the Charge Stream Pad Pluses. So this does have a faster charge than the previous version when they first came out with them. Oh, next drawer. This is like, what is it, deal or no deal? (sliding) Charge Stream travel kit. Universal oh, oh, hello. I'm obsessed with small tiny little bags like this, everything that I travel with has like a tiny, little package that keeps everything inside of it separate from other things. So this is so cool, I've got everything I could possibly need. I've got a micro USB cable, I would probably throw in a lighting cable, a USB-C in here, because I like to make sure I have everything. Oh, this is good for road trips. Look at this tiny, little car charging port. We've got just your regular charging brick. This is cool. It's like a super small little charging wedge, it's not plugged in so it's obviously not charging. Perfect for traveling. Oh, we've got the rest of the little accessories. For the car adaptor, we've got the car charger, also, this is cool, you can mount it on your dashboard. It's got a little tape right there, so you will be able to put that on your dashboard. This is to extend from the dashboard mount so if you want to have it a little further out. (squeaking) Wall adaptor for my Streampad. Oh my gosh, the rest of the accessories. I'm such a sucker for cables. (clunking) This is exciting. I'm actually heading to the airport in thirty mintues, so you better believe I am packing all of these goodies. I also wanted to go over a few other wireless things that I've been using with my phone. These aren't necessarily chargers. These are my most favorite recent tech things that I got. This is the JBL Halls (laughs) This is such a cool little device. It's battery powered, you obviously have to plug it in to charge it. But this is so fun because we've just been carrying these things around the house, we take them to friend's houses, and the best thing about it is that lights up and looks cool in the background of a videos. It sounds good too. (gasps) There's an Eastside acoustic? (\"Eastside\" by Benny Blanco) Benny is my new favorite person to follow on social media. I think that we would be probably be friends if we met in real life? I'm not sure. Either way his music is great, and he's really funny. (music gets louder) We don't need a copyright strike. It's just reminds me of a really cool drink. Another thing that I am obsessed with, this is a DJI Copilot. They partnered with LaCie to make this hard drive that you can basically insert a SD card and if you are out and about, so right now we are out on this beautiful lake flying drones, and we don't have a computer with us, so we can put an SD card in here, copy all the footage onto this hard drive, and then I can plug this into my phone, and I can download all the videos, all the photos, I'm taking a hyperlapse right now, and it's almost completed. (upbeat techno music) No computer guys. This is magic. Can you see it, can you see it? Little SD card? Says it's copying eight of eighty. So here's the Copilot, this is the actual drive, so I just copied all of these files to it. So this is one of the pictures I just saved. Here's the video. Oh my god, that's an incredible shot. Nathan, you were so close to that boat. (upbeat techno music) These (clunk) are the Bose Quiet Comfort 35 series two noise canceling headphones. It's been a while since I've had a really good pair of headphones. Since I got the ear pods that's all I use. Now, they are good headphones, but they're not noise canceling, and these are super high quality. So these have been my travel companion for the past month or so, and the quality is incredible. It's also cool because this Bluetooth can connect to not only my phone but my laptop at the same time. So it switches very, very quickly, and I'm not consistently reconnect things. But the sound quality (thunk) so good. For flights it's the absolute best. I don't have to hear children crying, I don't have to hear the sound of myself breathing, I can just listen to my tunes (zipper) fall asleep. I'm curious, do any of you have trouble falling asleep on flights? Because sometimes I do, but most of the time, I will pass out before the plane even takes off. It's like, you look over, I'm drooling on myself, and I'm in the most awkward, uncomfortable position. Well, that does it for some of my favorite wireless things that I've been loving recently. A huge thank you for Mofi, these are incredible, I think it's definitely a game changer, if you are always on the go, even if you are not on the go, half of the time I'm sitting on the couch, and I'm charging my phone with one of these power bricks. Again, I'll put a link in the description if you guys want to check out any of these things, and don't forget to use to us iJustine at check out if you want to get twenty percent off any of the Charge Stream products I talked about today. So, that's it, I'm going to go finish packing, hopefully get to the airport on time. So many fun gadgets, I'm so excited for the future, it's like you see the cool things that being released and coming out now, but can you imagine, think about it, five years, ten years, the cool tech we are gonna have? (world music) Gah, I'm going to retire at that point.",

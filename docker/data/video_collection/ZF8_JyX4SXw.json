    "transcript": "this little PC that looks like an infrastructure project built by Engineers with a wild PCP addiction is the cheapest AM5 gaming PC I could build using parts from AliExpress, and wow! Did this not gowell... Oh! I think it just crashed again oh please but before we delve into my suffering today's video is sponsored by Deep Cool's new CH160case a mini ITX enclosure with an insatiable appetite for gratuitously sized aircoolers - a rare talent in the space aside from big air coolers, thiick Graphics cards are also welcome it also comes with a handle so if you're in the market for a high airflow ITX case with great temperatures while gaming at an affordable price check out the Deep cool CH160 with the link in the video description thank you deep cool for sponsoring today's video [Music] now one of my favorite things to do with this kind of packaging is guess the parcel just figure out what's inside based on its grotesque exterior because these sellers package stuff real weirdly this box for example looks CPU shaped but then what is this cowat looking package cuz if you touch it and feel it it feels a lot like the inner packaging of a CPU box but then what what is this is this the cooler yeah I guess the best way to find out is open it up so let's see if this CPU bet pays off no it isn't this is an nvme Drive in a tiny little box and this poorly box endowed nvme drive cost $44 Canadian for 250 gigs so does that mean that there is a CPU living in here this is definitely a CPU although it's not packaged in the way I was expecting okay my first instinct was correct and this is a fascinating am5 CPU a ryen 5 7500f AMD clearly continuing ripping off Intel branding but this is a CPU that's actually not available in the Western Market and it's like a budget six core am5 Chip And as far as I can tell the main differences between it and a 7600 is a slightly lower boost frequency and that it has no igpu which makes the F plagiarism even funnier and it cost 170 CAD including shipping which is quite a bit cheaper than the 7600 But you are getting it shipped in a little bit of plastic they found in a bin and with no cooler this one feels and sounds very air cooler the ice 200 Pro this was the cheapest am5 compatible CPU Cooler I could find which cost a whopping 10 Canadian dollars including shipping and it comes with two whole heat pipes this one's easy it's obviously Ram oh we got some Ram inspired by Spinners on a '90s low rider and it's about as performance oriented as said low rider which cost me $98 Canadian dollar which considering that it's 16 gigs of peasant ddr5 that's pretty expensive this box feels power supply and my power supply I mean low yield dirty bomb because that's that's the only kind of power supply you get for no money off of AliExpress oh yeah B that fake 600 W power supply oh it comes with an RGB fan so never mind this thing is going to be a beast there's some terrifying frat bro tattoo on the side wo it's equipped with a six plus TW pin VGA cardboard wow but despite these Uber premium features I got it for a Ste at just $40 Canadian dollars oh a gigabyte motherboard so we have a new top fire hazard Contender and our pyro Catalyst board cost $130 Canadian dollar which for a b650 board is actually very cheap this last one's either a graphics card or a flotation device those are looking like some very Nvidia colors in there which did I buy the right graphics card uh yeah no I've never been wronged by a graphics card box that says gaming graphics card on the front and that's basically all the information it gives you although it is real comforting to note that M graphics cards are equipped with an upgraded power solution great cooling system and excellent connectivity and our confidence inspiring mystery GPU came in at 59 Canadian dollars but that price is a little bit of a jabate because shipping cost more than the GPU itself bringing up the total to $132 Canadian Dollars and then finally we just have the case left which is by good old Golden Field a brand we know well on the channel but we'll have a closer look at the case once we build it which brings the total cost of our cheapest am5 build to $815 Canadian dollar which includes the obscene shipping on a couple of our components but with that let's Cobble our weirdly Advanced AliExpress Abomination together now the first wildly exciting thing about this motherboard is despite costing about as much as a Big Mac we still get an integrated rear IO Shield something that's I just I'm so excited about said io's not great no USBC but at least we get Wi-Fi other than that there's not a whole lot to say about the motherboard uh other than we do only have two memory slots which should make this very good at overclocking also no seamos battery next we got to drop our natac shadow RGB in which I don't know surely Shadow and RGB is mutually [Music] exclusive oh look at that Chrome you know what they say plastic Chrome is the classiest material I mean it matches the plain metal aesthetic on the motherboard which at this price point is just a happy coincidence another nice thing about this gigabyte motherboard is that it doesn't have those stupid seesaw half Ram Clips this is way [Music] better this is just such funny packaging for an SSD ooh PCI gen 3 fancy [Music] our dollar menu cooler is [Music] next I'm just so excited to see how this thing handles an am5 CPU now first we get our our Viking sache of thermal paste now when it comes to mounting the actual cooler there aren't uh any instructions so I'm just going to assume that I stick it down on here and then yeah there we go that's mounted now again weirdly all of this stuff is so coordinated this was not on purpose I just bought the cheapest of everything but somehow it it's kind of it's kind of working aesthetically and before I forget let me just quickly pop a seos battery in here so I don't spend hours suffering trying to get the PC working later [Music] oh it's also silver how does all of it match I don't understand apparently past darid is way better at shopping on AliExpress than I [Music] anticipated I mean I guess the reason it all matches is because it's just cheaper not to paint stuff but that's a pretty cool looking case I like that the Chrome handles matches our RAM and there does seem to be a little bit of front ventilation which is cool this like bare steel look it's it's almost app and the power button not meaning to sound extremely pretentious but that's a little unrefined for my liking but before we start opening this stuff up and dropping things in we need to get our power supply [Music] unpackaged oh I just realized this is the same brand as the air cooler so I I guess this is the power supply equivalent of that air cooler which really puts into perspective how terrible this power supply is going to [Music] be oh yeah this just such a satisfying tiny Hollow feeling to these power supplies which just screams quality but at least they weren't lying about the RGB fan I think it it it looks like it'll light up and considering where the power supply sits in the case we're going to get to see it as well unfortunately we will also be seeing this atrocity of power supply cables no way they included an installation guide for the power supply but not their CPU Cooler oh I just noticed another concerning thing it just says 220 volt on it everywhere I looked the power supply just had 200 volt compatibility listed so I had to make another plan okay you know what I'm still going to stall it I bought a stepup Transformer so it should be fine I [Music] guess wow that is really dumb because like you see we've got this fan pulling air from the hot system inside and the back of the power supply blocks all of the front ventilation this Cable's also the wrong length so it's like super in the way of the motherboard but you know that's fine [Music] okay so now we just need to somehow figure out the cable management in here which may not take too long cuz we don't have a whole lot of options luckily we get some of the most ghetto looking zip ties [Music] now the cable management if you can call it that didn't go too terribly I mean there's there's still some clumps going on but we could hide a bunch of the runs behind the motherboard which helps the same goes for like the front panel connectors and stuff so it doesn't look that awful I think now unfortunately accessory wise we didn't get any super dodgy Molex to pcie power adapters which is very [Music] disappointing wild plastic aside this was the cheapest AMD graphics card I could get and I know that because it said cheapest in the name but it's kind of crazy cuz this is an RX 580 which is quite a powerful graphics card now again the purchase price was deceptive because the shipping more than doubled that price and when it comes to IO it looks like it's even going to be the real thing thing which is very exciting and we even get some heat pipes in our great cooling [Music] system and just like that our am5 AliExpress build was done so now all I had to do is wait till the next day for my stepup Transformer to arrive and then [Music] suffering so this is the stepup Transformer I thought it was like 90 Canadian doar and apparently this is a 1,500 W variant very fancy and because of this we can now use a 230 volt output so I've got everything plugged in let's um and then we turn this on and that's a promising start oh I just realized I haven't plugged anything else into it yet wait give me a second okay so I've I've plugged everything in we've restarted the the system so hopefully we get a video out we very much did not get a signal out even after the system rebooted itself and I tried every output on the back of the graphics card okay well we're not getting a signal out of it that's very fun and because the motherboard doesn't have post codes I have no idea what's wrong with it but I'm going to go out on a limb and say it's probably that graphics card cuz it was suspiciously cheap so I'm going to swap something else in there and see if we get a signal out then but unfortunately swapping in a known working rx580 still didn't give us a signal out I then decided to swap out the war crimes power supply which also didn't help okay so after a while of tinkering we know now that it's not the power supply because this power supply doesn't work either and it's not the graphics card so I guess next I'm going to try the RAM and once I dropped some trusty Patriot DDR five in there the system worked for now look at that we're getting a signal at with our Patriot Viper Ram in there so apparently Chrome Ram is not a good idea I then installed some windows and graphics card drivers which went flawlessly but when I tried to launch CS2 My Hope was again shattered hey yes and we've even got an overlay what's happening what was happening was the PC crashed no oh and when I restarted I don't know man this PC is on drugs it seemed like the reason the system crashed was because the graphics C driv is corrupted the version of your AMD software is not compatible with your graphics driver how is my driver not compatible with my driver that doesn't even make sense I then ddu wiped and reinstalled my drivers but when I tried launching csgo the same thing happened again I think it just crashed again oh please I then tried a different version of the graphics driver which did the same thing there's suddenly no readings from the GPU no matter what I did with every fresh driver install after just a couple seconds of load on the GPU the driver would corrupt and the system would crash I then swapped the AliExpress graphics card out for the RX 580 I bought from wish I looked at a couple of videos ago and after a quick driver install it worked it's running finally we have lost two components in the meantime but with different RAM and a different graphics card in here well it's the same kind of graphics card but it's not the same graphics card we're actually getting quite a lot of frame rate playing CS2 it it's quite stuttery but that is an issue that CS2 does seem to have sometimes uh even with the with the Bots although that is particularly bad this is a 1080p low I'm not sure if I said with 15% utilization on our 5 GHz ryzen 5 temperatures are great with that tiny little cooler oh I actually need to put the side panel back on now moving over to cyberp punk at 1080p low settings we're getting 60 frames per second honestly it it scales down pretty well visually it it doesn't look terrible uh but having said that now that we have higher utilization on our CPU the temperature has quickly gone way higher 85c with just 3 sish perc utilization so it's not going great but much better than I thought it was going to go with that $10 cooler I was expecting like a category 5 house fire with that thing Doom maternal at 1080p medium settings on paper is running very well about 90 frames per second but despite that high frame rate it doesn't feel or look particularly great I'm not entirely sure why that's happening generally the system ran the crap out of Esports titles at 1080p as you'd expect from a system with an RX 580 in it a graphic SC that's maybe not quite well endowed enough to keep up with that am5 CPU speaking of CPU I did run cinebench R20 on the 7500f and it is a reasonable amount slower than my 7600 X but there's also a pretty big price gap between the two CPUs also when looking at Crystal disc Mark that ssd's performance isn't a complete Abomination for what it is which just leaves one last mystery what's wrong with our RX 580 well frankly I have no idea what's wrong WR with it I took the cooler off and it looks RX 580 to me I even launched GPU Z and it also seems to think that it's just an rx580 so my best guess at this point is that there isn't much of a mystery here and it's just a dying GPU which means we had to drag our system across the Finish Line with two dead components in it oh that's not great now if you do want to see an all am5 system with a much higher rate of component survival check out the video that will be suggested in a second and also subscribe to the channel while you're there and um yeah that brings me to the end of the video thank you for watching bye-bye [Music]",

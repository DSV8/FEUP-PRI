It's only a prototype for now, but Oppo will have it in a phone for sale by the summer.

    "transcript": "- Hey guys I'm Vlad with The Verge here at MWC 2019. And what I have with me is Oppo's new 10x optical lossless zoom camera system housed in a prototype. It's on lockdown very tightly, all we can really do is play around with the camera app. But that's really what we're here for. (upbeat music) Oppo's new system is claimed, it has a 10x lossless zoom that works with three lenses. Over here in the back you have one main camera, 48 megapixels then you have a wide angle, ultra wide angle lens that covers an equivalent of 60 millimeters. And then you have a telephoto lens which covers in photos up to 160. So you're going from 16 to 160 millimeters of optical zoom, inside your phone without it being especially thick. Alright so just to get an idea of when it switches between the lenses, at the moment it's using the main lens. But I'm going to cover up the telephoto lens with my finger at the back. And then start zooming, and at 8.2 it switches so. This is it using the telephoto lens right now. And one thing I immediately noticed with the telephoto lens, is you get quite a bit of a jelly effect. Because it does have optical stabilization. But because it's so zoomed in you get a jelly effect on the screen when you're moving it around. So obviously this is gonna be terrifically good for video. Oppo doesn't even let us try to do any videos. So in order to get really close with the telephoto lens it has a periscope system on the inside. Mirrors and lenses inside the body of the phone. So having an ultra wide angle lens like this, isn't particularly new, companies like LG and quite a few others have done it. Even having a telephoto lens on top, having three and four lenses isn't especially new. What Oppo has done is optimized everything. It has improved the size, it's reduced the size while improving the zoom. The results, we're gonna have to test it we're gonna have to review it. But on the first look it does look like a really compact system. I mean just look at the thickness of this phone. When you consider that it's got this case on it, it looks exactly the size of a regular phone you're not really compromising physically. But you're gaining so much in terms of optical zoom. When I take a photo with the telephoto lens versus when I take a wide angle photo and then zoom in. The difference in detail and sharpness is really easily noticeable. That being said this photo isn't in focus because you do have quite a bit of a minimum focusing distance with the telephoto, you're not gonna be able to take really macro shots with this lens. So it's really designed for subjects that are distant from you. You will be familiar that Oppo and One Plus are kinda sister companies they work very closely. And Oppo tells us this is coming in quarter two of 2019 which might be around the time when we can expect the next One Plus flagship. So if the next One Plus phone, which may or may not be the One Plus 7 happens to have a camera system like this don't be surprised. So that's it our first look at Oppo's new 10x lossless optical zoom camera system. It's not a new 5G phone, it's not foldable, it's not even an actual device yet, but again it's an exciting new development, and exciting new addition. Camera phones are getting formidably good these days and this is distinctly different and unique. So for more technology from here at MWC 2019 which includes cameras, lenses, foldables, 5G but no 6G sorry. Stay tuned to TheVerge.com and YouTube.com/TheVerge.",

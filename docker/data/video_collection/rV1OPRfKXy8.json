    "transcript": "So I'm here with the new OnePlus 11 concept. The idea here is these light strips aren't just aesthetic. There's a new cooling system OnePlus has developed which says it can keep it a couple degrees cooler when charging and playing games. The idea being if you're playing games, you get a couple extra frames per second. And if you're charging it can charge ever so slightly faster. So not just an aesthetic. No pricing release date for this. It is just a concept phone. OnePlus has a tendency to release previous concept phones so I kind of suspect this might be the same. But still, it is a cool design.",

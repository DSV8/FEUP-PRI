    "transcript": "- Hello, my friends. And welcome. Today, well, we got a fake iPhone. - So, I found your credit card and I've been going to town on some Wish products. - Is that the X20 Pro? - Arg! This is actually really strong tape. - (laughs) (beeps) - [Austin] So this is the 6.5 inch iOS duplicate smartphone, which according to the listing looks exactly like an iPhone 11 Pro. - [Matt] Wasn't it not even duplicate. It was like, doplicate. Or like, it was spelt wrong. - Duplupicate? - Yeah, it was just, just massive typo. - [Austin] Well there's literally nothing on the front. It's got this yellow tape. But we do have on the back, it's a super AMOLED HD screen, a high digital camera, face recognition, and it's 8 core. - I was really hoping that they would've found a way to fake iOS but... - Oh, well, we'll see. It may be is a fake. It's like an iOS gun. For 160 bucks? Oh, who am I kidding. There's no way this this is gonna be (mumbles). - This thing is gonna be hot garbage. If you're gonna duplicate an iPhone, you gotta duplicate the experience, which they have not done. So, we open this. Oh, actually, that looks... - (gasps) It's Lightning. - [Matt] This comes with a Lightning adapter. - [Austin] Oh, wait a minute. - [Matt] And ear pods. Not Air Pods, ear pods. It wouldn't be a Chinese knockoff if it didn't come with a clear screen protector. This is disgusting. It's just, this is like crusty. I don't know what I just touched, but I'm gonna go burn my hand. - [Austin] So, these do look just like Lightning Air Pods. In fact, they are ear pods. They got the Lightning connector on it. - [Matt] Yeah. - Which is very surprising to me. They actually have a functioning Lightning port on this phone. Oh, that looks like an iPhone. - [Matt] This, this looks like an iPhone. - Whoa! - Whoa! No apple logo. - [Austin] But dude, that's close. - It's a pretty good replicate, but, like, there's clearly subtle differences. For one, this has some heff to it. Which is good for a fake. - [Austin] We've got the notch. - That's a Lightning port on the bottom of it. These are really close, as far as, like, the details go. I mean, it's a little bit smaller, like ever so slightly. - [Austin] Is it though? - [Matt] It's ever so slightly smaller. - Uh... It's not a huge difference. - I mean, it's... - Oh, it's on. - You turned it on. - Welcome, okay. All right. Let's start. - So already, it's just clearly not iOS. - And also, there's a pretty fat bezel on the bottom, which there's certainly not... - [Matt] It's there. But I mean, if you look here up, it's not bad. It doesn't go quite out to the edges the same way, but still fairly convincing. The notch looks pretty much identical. - And so there actually is a camera in the notch. - Yeah. - [Matt] Okay. - [Austin] we got something here. Oh, look at that! Wait, hold on, hold on. - This is really close. So, the key board is clearly the android keyboard. - [Austin] Yeah. - [Matt] It definitely is not an iOS keyboard. This is a skin, but... - [Austin] It's pretty good though. - [Matt] It's really convincing. It's weird to see, like, all these iOS apps and just, the Play music store. - [Austin] And then the Play store up here. - Yeah, like. What's weird is how these, some of these apps are cut out. - [Austin] Scaled, yeah. - The Twitter app. Like, that was really sluggish. - [Austin] Oo. Okay. - [Matt] Some of these are not great. - Okay, let me try this. Oh, that's, I mean, that's a pretty-- - [Matt] You couldn't have waited until I was ready for that picture? - [Austin] It's fine. - [Matt] Oh my god. - Okay, hold on. So, we have one camera, and two. Oh, we only have two cameras. We just don't have a wide. So, one, two. This is definitely just a single camera that they are just punching in very slightly. - [Matt] So if we look at the back, two of those cameras are clearly identical components. - [Austin] What it looks like, is this is the real camera. These two don't do anything. So, as you can see, I'm covering both cameras with my finger right now and going between one and two x. It's clearly just using the single lens. All right, I'm trying to do a portrait mode, but it says move farther away, so I'm gonna move way farther away. Continue. Still too far? I think this mode just always says, \"move farther away.\" (laughs) How about slow-mo? What kind of slow-mo do we have? - All right, I got a slow-mo we can do. Ready? - [Austin] Yeah. - I definitely just spit everywhere. - I don't think that was actually recording slow motion, but let's see. That a maybe 60p, maybe? I can't even tell. So, an iPhone 11 camera, you're not getting here. So, wait, let's try to do front facing. Huh. - Oh. - All right. Wait, we can do 2x. (laughs) That's telephoto. Okay, ready? This is just bad. It's literally just trying to stitch a couple of our stills together. - It's super blurry. - [Austin] It is a decent iOS c-- Oh, we have Air space Play. What happens when I press that? Nothing, got it. Okay, how about I turn on the flashlight? Oh, that works. - [Matt] I mean, that works. - [Austin] \"At the same time, everyday to sleep and wake up is the key to the healthy sleep. Bad function can help. Get up, answer some simple questions to sad up the repeating alarm clock, and in the bed. Time to receive alerts.\" (laughs) - How hard is it and how expensive is it to hire a proper translator for, like-- - Actually, kind of expensive. - [Matt] Like, just have the real phone here with someone who speaks English and like-- - Matt, can you just check your privilege for one second? - (laughs) - [Austin] Wallet, what is a wallet. Oh, it's just Google Pay. - [Matt] It's just Google Pay. - Okay, um. Messages? Oh, that actually looks pretty legitimate. - [Matt] Besides the keyboard, yeah. - \"Sign into your iPhone.\" Oh, Apple ID. Oh, not sure of I want to sign into my Apple ID right now. That seems a little sketchy. - [Matt] You're gonna get hacked. - Oh, okay. I would like to add face ID. - You go to this trouble to replicate this software and still at 10%. - 20. I'm 20. 30. I'm live streaming my face to the manufacturer right now. - [Matt] Yes. - So now, if I lock the phone, it should work. Okay, so... Okay, swipe up to unlock. Enter passcode? Okay, wait. So, cancel. - [Matt] It goes through the motions of doing things, but doesn't actually work. - [Austin] What else do we have in the settings? I just like how it's asked me to give my Apple ID. - [Matt] Like, what happens when you go Siri? - [Austin] Voice control. Oh, that's like old school, before Siri. Play a song. Oh, it doesn't do anything. Also doesn't do anything. - [Matt] No, it actually just, it's literally just a jpeg. - [Austin] It's just... - It's just a picture of the interface. - [Austin] So, software update. I was 13.1. (laughs) - [Matt] Props for being updated. - [Austin] You know, fully updated, no worries there. You know, we're not even on the internet. Okay, so now, we finally see a little bit more information. 13.1, obviously alive. But it's \"andorid\" x20 Pro. - [Matt] (laughs) - [Austin] What's impressive is everything else here is perfectly, actually like, pretty much exactly duplicated from a real iPhone. We also have WiFi, apparently, network is usable. Carrier. We have a bunch of other stuff. - Is this floating around because android doesn't know how to handle just a swipe gesture? - Maybe. But also, I think a lot of people actually leave this on on iPhones. - Really? - Yeah, I think so. So actually, I mean, this looks like Safari. Mostly. Okay, well... - [Matt] It's sluggish. - This is unfortunate. \"We recently fixed the security issue that could've compromised your account.\" On Twitter? That I've never logged into? Okay. - [Man On Video] There's a bunch of fans on a-- - It's not the worst thing I ever sounded, but it's definitely not good. - Definitely not good. I think the real test now, does any of this Lightning stuff work? I'm gonna play a song here. (mumbles) By Kendrick. - It's working. - So you're hearing audio through the Lightning Jack? - It's horrible. - Is it? - It sounds like I'm in, it's like a tin cup. - Like, when I do this, I definitely hear like the headphones rattling inside my ears. It's very uncomfortable. It obviously doesn't have an Apple logo. But the feel is pretty similar. Everything is in the right spot. And the iOS skin on an android, is what I would consider to be passable. If I handed this to my mom, she would probably not recognize this is a fake iPhone. - Especially if you have a case on that. - Even without the case. No, I actually think that the exterior, like the fit and the finish and everything, actually is pretty impressive. - I think just, missing the logo, is the tech (mumbles). - I'm impressed with how good this feels for $160. I would say it's 85% is as good as an iPhone. There are very small differences that I can tell as far as the actual feel in the hand. - Let me ask you though. What's your definition of 85%? Because, are you looking, just from the built quality of looks? - So, it feels a little sharp on the edges. So, if you feel that compared to, say this phone, right? So, there's like no real edge here. So like, it feels a little bit, it's obviously not quite there. The camera bump feels little bit cheap. Like it's clear, just a little bit plastic that can like, peel up. Whereas it's glass on the iPhone. - I think this whole thing is a sticker. - With that being said, do I recommend buying this? No. - No. It's... - Of course not. - [Matt] So, with the Air Pods, it's clearly a fake. You know, whatever. But, they were passable. They were decent for $20. This here, is not even a decent phone. As you see, it's spazzing out right now just in your hand. I just don't know who this is for. Like, are they trying to counterfeit with this. It's not like, because you're not getting a phone that is actually passable for an iPhone. - Yeah, you're gonna buy this from some dude, like he's gonna put it out of his trunk. - Yeah. - And be like, \"hey, you want an iPhone for $300?\" Like, \"yeah, of course! I love a good deal!\" And why won't you trust the sketchy dudes selling iPhones out of the back of his trunk? That is the real stereotype right now. - That's how I started my channel. - You know what? I think it's a great way to end it. Thank you very much for watching this episode of This Is. Please don't buy this phone. But what you should do, is subscribe to the channel. Because, we have to justify buying more of these stupid things on Wish. - Don't worry, I still have Austin's credit card.",

    "transcript": "Hey everyone, it's Colin. How's it goin? When it comes to Sonic the Hedgehog some people immediately think of Sega's 16-bit console era But in the mid-90s, he and his cohorts found themselves on an unlikely platform This is the Sonic and Knuckles collection released in March 1997 for Microsoft's Windows 95 It includes Sonic 3, Sonic & Knuckles and predictably Sonic 3 & Knuckles All of which had originally been written for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive in 1994 Its system requirements listed a 100 megahertz 486 DX4 Or 75 megahertz Pentium processor, eight megabytes of RAM and a sound blaster 16 or better sound card But meeting or exceeding these requirements didn't guarantee a good gameplay experience, which we'll get to in a bit These days we'd expect the games to simply be the original roms running in emulation But the collection saw its titles get fully ported to Windows by Sega's PC software division Which was formed in 1996 Doing these sorts of ports was new to Sega at the time and prompted in part by the struggles The company's Saturn console faced in the marketplace Installing the game is relatively quick and it only takes up a few megabytes of disk space Even though what runs from the hard drive it annoyingly checks for the presence of the cd-rom as a form of basic copy protection Though this could be bypassed with some careful config file editing Running it presents you with a launcher screen where you could pick from the three titles after which the game opens in a window It supports two-player mode But the default keyboard controls are annoying at best Each player is map to opposite sides of the keyboard which makes for a cramped gaming session Bizarrely player one is set to use the arrow keys to move and the main Enter key to jump But thankfully the controls can be remapped pretty easily and the software supports some game pads and joysticks Unfortunately, I found game performance to be hit and miss on some period hardware It plays fine, but others can experience choppy results my think-pad 300e for example Well exceeds the minimum requirements, but it drops frames frequently, when the game works though The video quality is pristine. It runs at 60 frames per second and the image is super sharp with vibrant colors The original console version looks like a blurry mess by comparison especially over composite video But one thing I think the console does better is sound the sonic and knuckles collection used a fully synthesized soundtrack Instead of simply playing back recordings of the mega drives music you have the choice of using FM synth or MIDI the quality of the soundtrack and just how it sounded overall was thus highly dependent on your sound card and its capabilities In many cases this meant that even in FM synth mode the music came across noticeably different than the console version many were familiar with The MIDI version generally sounded even more bland though If you had a high-end PCM unit like a Roland Sound Canvas, you could get a better but still different experience It's also important to note that while the gameplay was overall the same, some of the background music was replaced The most notable examples of this are the themes for launch base, carnival night and ice cap zones No official reason for these changes was given Though there are a few popular theories ranging from licensing issues centered around the belief that Michael Jackson Was involved in the console versions soundtrack To more practical reasons like the use of audio samples Which the console hardware could handle fine, but some sound cards couldn't reproduce simultaneously with MIDI instruments Another quirk of the collection is how it plays on modern systems Specifically it doesn't, on newer hardware or in virtual machines. It just kind of loses its mind Thankfully, there's a fan-made patch program from 2015 called Sega PC reloaded that can install and modify the game so it works correctly and even provides some additional options like enabling the debug menu or Allowing you to supply your own music files Finally the cd-rom includes a bonus screen saver Which is really just a slideshow of images and artwork from several Sonic games Along with the original music and sound effects Yep, they got the music right for the screen saver, but not the game itself Sonic and Knuckles collection wasn't the only console title that Sega ported to the PC Sonic CD Virtua Fighter 2 and Ecco the Dolphin all made an appearance among others And while the game certainly has some rough spots It's ultimately very playable and the image quality is hard to beat, it was never an expensive game Originally selling for about $30 us and got re-released in 2000 as a bargain bin title by expert software. I found my copy at a used bookstore for 3 bucks but these days it's considered abandoned ware and can be downloaded from the Internet Archive And with the Sega PC reloaded patch, It's a surprisingly fun way to play What's arguably one of the best titles in the sonic lineup Provided you can stand the music If You liked the video.

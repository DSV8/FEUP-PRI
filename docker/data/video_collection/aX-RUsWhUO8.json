    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and today's video is gonna be kind of cool because I'm gonna get the chance to show you this really fun feature that YouTube is rolling out for the holidays. It's called YouTube Shopping. It's a huge thank you to YouTube for partnering with me on this video. Now, some of the products that I'm gonna show you here today are actually gifts that I have bought people in the past and they're like top gifts that have had incredible reactions. Now obviously it's interesting 'cause as I get older I feel like the things that I get excited about are a lot of home goods, smart home products things to make my life a little bit easier for cooking, for cleaning, for lighting. So today I'm gonna share with you a few of the things that I have absolutely loved gifting in the past and things that I basically feel like I can't live without in my home currently. So with YouTube shopping it's a really great way for audiences to share products that they're already talking about and you guys can actually shop them directly from the video. If you wanna check out any of the products that I've talked about in today's video you can click the view products label and you can shop them directly from here. So the first product we're gonna talk about today is this Dyson Humidifier. Now this not only is a humidifier but it is also an air filter and it will also filter out formaldehyde. I am such a huge fan of Dyson because they have such a huge line of products especially when it comes to their air filters because they have some that will not only provide heat but they will also have cooling. Now I have one in my house and we recently got one of these for my parents and they absolutely love it. I have several different sizes of these Dyson purifiers in various rooms in my home. I have one here in the studio and the one that I have here is the formaldehyde one. This is using Dyson's most advanced filtration system so it combines a precise solid state formaldehyde sensor with a unique filter that continuously destroys formaldehyde. This filter removes gases and odors and a HEPA filter captures 99.97 of particles 0.3 microns in size. It has powerful air multiplier technology which projects purified humidified air throughout the room. - [Justine] Maddie, Oh Maddie. (laughs) Oh my God. (laughing) Maddie, no. She's busy. - [Guest] Hi Maddie. (laughs) - [Justine] This tale, Maddie. I also really like this because it can be voice controlled and honestly if there's anything in my home that I can control with my voice and I don't have to do anything else I am so here for it. Now, this next product is very high on my list of basically just items I cannot live without. This is the Brava Home Oven, and this is an infrared oven. And not only does this connect to an app but you have this incredible library of recipes that you can basically make anything that you can even think of inside of this thing. I honestly just use it a lot of times every single morning to make toast. I make a lot of egg breakfast sandwiches in this thing. You can make some really fantastic gourmet meals just inside of the oven. This is my favorite feature with the Brava oven is it has a camera that's connected to it. So right now I'm watching my English muffins be cooked. Like, I can see them. They can't see me, but I can see them. And my morning routine normally consists of putting in my breakfast sandwich, my eggs I hit start, run and get a shower. I have my phone open, so I'm actually taking a shower watching my food cook, and I time it just so I can hop out of the shower when my food is going to be done. (relaxing music) Oh, it's hot. - [Guest] What did you do? - It's so hot. I don't know. I don't know. I'm not sure. (laughs) Whoa, so, so so toasty! - [Justine] Another thing I like is if this wasn't crispy enough, I can do a little touch up but obviously this is very, very crispy and we're set, we good. Now, again, this is an incredible gift. It is a little bit on the more expensive side but I promise you this is the gift that keeps on giving. We have got one of these for a bunch of my friends as gifts, my family, and pretty much most of my friends at this point, they have bought one because of me and my sister nonstop talking about it. So thank you Brava for being such an incredible gift and also something that has completely improved my life. It's just so much fun and I honestly cannot say enough incredible things about it. Now this next gift, which is actually something that I already have but I just got a couple extras for myself. This is Nanoleaf. Now, I love Nanoleaf. I like them a lot because these have thread technology so you don't need some separate kind of hub to actually make these work. You kind of just hold them up close to your phone. They work with Home Kit and the ones that I have here today I have got the Nanoleaf Essentials. So this has three different light bulbs and this one I actually got for my living room. This is a light strip, so this is gonna go behind my TV. I can't wait because you can connect this to your phone you can change it to a bunch of different colors and it's pretty much another piece of life changing tech. I'm actually gonna open the bulbs so I can show you what they look like. Nanoleaf also has a ton of other lighting accessories. Ta-da! I got these ones specifically for my office because I have a light that has three light bulbs and I kind of want to change the hue because I just painted my office pink. So I wanted to change the colors and light bulbs that I have in there now are just basic LED lights. Now, why I think this is a great gift for people is because you don't need to have some special thing that connects to your router and it's pretty easy to use. Okay, here it is. One of the lights is already installed so I have to put the other two in. It was super easy. All I had to do was scan the QR code. I installed the light and it automatically connected to my home. Let's put the other two in. (easy listening music) (music continues) It's so bright. There we go. All three are now added. So I can choose my lights inside of my Apple Home app and I can also adjust these in the Nanoleaf app to make them any color I want. - [Justine] So I can go in and change the colors of these lights. I can go in and I can make it pink. I can make it blue and I can make it green. I'm so excited about this. I have my new lights, my new pink wall. Spoiler alert for future video, but I usually keep my lights kind of turned this way just so it kind of gives me a little light reflecting off. But I'm really excited about having this now in here because I can basically change them any color I want. Turn them off and on from my app. It's pretty exciting. This is gonna look so great in my living room. These are so cool. I'm so hyped. - [Justine] So one of the reasons that I was also really excited about this is because I don't really decorate for the holidays, but with this I can start changing the colors of the lighting in my home very, very easily. You can have a nice theme while you're watching your favorite TV show or you know your favorite YouTuber on YouTube. Hi. Hi. That's me. It's okay if I'm not your favorite. Just maybe like top three maybe, which will put me there. Now, my last gift that I'm gonna show you is the Ring Stick Up camera. And actually, Well. you can't see it, but it's right here. Da da da da da I'm a really big fan of these stickup cameras mostly because of the size. And the battery life on this, actually lasts a pretty long time. You can actually get a solar panel connector. So if you do wanna stick this outside there's a solar panel that will be able to power it. There is also a wired AC connector that you can get to connect to an outlets but I mostly just use the battery powered ones. I always have a battery that is charged on hand and I just pop it in whenever I need it. So I have this connected to the Ring app. So I'm gonna hit go live. There we are, we are live! I'd like to keep this here in the office. It's a nice view. I can basically see everything. I'm gonna end that because you're gonna actually be able to see me shooting this video. Like this is me setting up, you know, I'm scrolling through. Look at that. Look at me work. I was itching myself. (laughs) So this was this morning at 2:35 AM cleaning up getting set up, all set up, and we're back to live. If I wanna share this, I just can click share. I can share this with my neighbors. If there was a crime, if this happened to capture a crime I could share it with rings. So this can be a video that's featured by Ring or I have some more options. I can email, text, or copy the video link. And here's my shared video. - [Justine In Video] And this is going to, you'll actually be able to. Okay, there it is. There we are. We are live! - Ring session. So that's the Ring Stickup camera. Huge fan. And I'm sure many of you guys have actually used these before. So if you have, I'd love to hear from you the comments below. What do you think? Have you captured anything cool? Okay, we're gonna put you back now. Back where you belong. Thank you guys so much for watching. This was such a fun video. And again, if you want to check out any of the products that I talked about today now with YouTube shopping, you'll be able to shop them directly from this video. This is such a cool feature and I'm so excited about it. And of course, the holidays are right around the corner so of course, YouTube shopping can be one of the great places that you could get all of your holiday shopping done just by watching YouTube videos. Pretty cool. If you guys haven't already please subscribe to my YouTube channel. I will see you guys in my next video and in the comments below. Bye. (upbeat music)",

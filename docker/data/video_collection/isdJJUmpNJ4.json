    "transcript": "what's up everyone Eber here with Hardware Canucks and here we are with another one of these graphic card reviews and interestingly enough we're actually taking a look at NVIDIA's affordable GPU of their RTX series so this is the RTX 2070 and before again to the test results and all that kind of stuff I just want to describe this situation or this recording scenario because this is not the typical Hardware Canucks studio space in fact I'm actually recording this from a hotel in Beijing so yeah this might be this video might be a little bit shorter than normally what you're expecting but needless to say all the testing has been completed before we left ok so a few weeks ago you guys may recall that we didn't explain video talking about the RTX 2070 its architecture and what NVIDIA is offering for its ridiculous $600 Founders Edition price tag so if you're interested in learning more about the core clocks the specs and all that kind of stuff I'd highly recommend checking out that video right over here but it actually turns out that a lot of predictions from then have been proven to be right but some weren't this launch is also a bit odd since there were some weird stuff going on behind the scenes so more on that right after message from our sponsor so you're saying this is the most colorful way to cool I'm telling you the master liquid ml 360 are RGB is the way to go cooler masters new 360 millimetre all-in-one liquid cooler is all about performance in style with a custom low resistance radiator and dual chamber pump wood sleeve tubing for that premium look while being totally flexible the fan strike your balance for air pressure and airflow with transparent blades to perfectly match the colorful combination of the pump then you can sync via its own controller or through various addressable and 12-volt RGB connectors all right perhaps you should check it out in the scripture middle alright so I think it's time for some honest talk guys because nothing about the RTX 2070 launch has been typical and everyone here is pretty frustrated about a week ago we still had no info on samples or even in communication within video remember this was just a few business days prior to a major launch and so we decided to do a little bit of investigating well it turns out that after being called out about starting at prices that never materialized for the RTX 2080 ti and the RTX 2080 things were going to be done a bit differently this time instead of sending out founders editions for the review NVIDIA had told their board partners to sample their $500 RTX 2070's i'm gently a very few of them were producing those in time for launch so they had to scramble to shift with their production we also heard that partners we're told that they couldn't send out a pre overclock card without also sending a $500 sample but that requirement was dropped at the last minute Nvidia is obviously trying to control the messaging on this launch and refocus our attention towards their entry-level RTX 2070 instead of the ultra expensive $600 founders Edition I'm perfectly fine with that provided it gives us a realistic snapshot of the market and you know what I don't think that's what will happen after talking to every board partner it seems like the majority of cards will be hitting the $550 to $600 price points it's obvious things didn't work out like Nvidia planed since most board partners we're very late with sampling but no one here is gonna complain about having about two days to put this review together because you know what we'll do whatever it takes to get you guys the info you need without crying about losing sleep or long hours that includes filming this video on the other side of the world okay so let's get to the GPUs that I'm gonna be covering first up is the ASUS RTX 2070 Turbo which is a pretty basic blower style card like I'm sure you can predict it'll hit the magical $599 price point expected to be in fairly limited supply at launch with availability at Newegg and a bit later at Amazon and other retailers there isn't any overclock and boost frequencies is rated at sixteen ten megahertz the interesting thing here is that it uses a six plus eight pin layout even though TDP is rated at 175 watts it actually looks like ASUS took their RTX 2080 turbo PCB and popped in an RTX 2070 core in the other card is much more interesting in my opinion this is the EVGA RTX 2080 XC and it's priced at five hundred and fifty dollars despite having a custom cooler and an overclocked boost frequency of a 1710 megahertz this happens to be the same spec as the NVIDIA Founders Edition which costs a good fifty dollars more the XE is a bit long at ten point six inches but nothing like some of the alternatives like a ASUS's Strix OC or MSI's Duke series EVGA also happens to have a longer more comprehensive warranty than nvidia and this card should be widely available right at launch we're also going to approach comparisons a bit differently in this video and focus on the cards that are of the overall market right now the problem is that buyers have less and less choice when it comes to alternatives to the RTX 2070 unless they go into the used market the GTX 1080 and GTX 1070 TI are in short supply all around but the GTX 1070 is a bit better but they're still going up in price so here's a quick list of the cards that I'm gonna be using here along with their current approximate prices unfortunately some of these have been increasing lately because of low supply versus high demand so be aware of that I'll leave a link in the description to the lowest priced and in stock GTX 10 series cards I could find but these were the ones we either had on hand or purchased in the last few weeks alright so with all that out of the way let's jump right into the benchmarks starting first with how well the EVGA and Asus RTX 2070 cards can maintain their clock speeds I was a bit worried that the blower stock card from Asus would had some higher temperatures but that didn't really happen the max it achieved was 73 degrees Celsius but the EVGA XC's dual fan downdraft cooler ended up easily beating it with its peak temp of 68 degree Celsius you can also see that in order to maintain these 73 degrees Celsius mark the Asus turbo had to fluctuate its clock speeds quite a bit and it ended up running around 1680 megahertz which is right in line with his specs EVGA on the other hand is really stable after it settles around 1810 megahertz but how does this all translate into performance and games well let's roll the benchmarks you're more than welcome to pause on any of them if you want to take a closer look at them just keep in mind that in order to reduce CPU bottlenecks running all these tests on an i9 7900X overclocked to 4.74 gigahertz with 32 gigabytes of memory overclocked to 3600 megahertz so there you have an idea of where these two cards stack up to the competition but there are some other things that we need to look into first let's talk about power consumption first since the RTX cards have absolutely huge cores and do tend to require a lot of juice so it turns out that power consumption isn't all that bad for either of these cards right now with both needing less than an overclocked GTX 1080 but what we don't know is what will happen to these numbers when RTX features are enabled remember a lot of the die space is taken up by the RT intensive course and normal applications those aren't being used okay now on to sound testing I was a bit worried that the Asus RTX 2070 Turbo would be quite loud but it actually wasn't it's a bit louder than the downdraft coolers but you are also getting the advantage of exhausting hot air outside the case that could be a real benefit if you are using a smaller form factor system and for the EVGA XC well what can we say it's very very quiet well the benchmarks certainly provide an interesting insight into the RTX 2070's plays in the market however actually buying a GPU right now isn't an easy process at all and that's because the existing 10 series GTX 10 series cards are getting harder and harder to find and you know prices are kind of all over the place I mean if you look hard enough you may be able to find a GTX 1080 for $470 dollars or 1070 TI for $400 but for the most part they are either a little bit more expensive than that price point or there are out of stock now you could look the used market is certainly an option to look into but they are flooded with mining GPUs so watch out for those anyways coming back to the RTX 2070 and you know I've talked about the whole mess surrounding this launch so I'm not going to touch on that again but is very clear that the $600 RTX 2070 Founder's Edition is a ridiculously overpriced GPU period luckily we were able to benchmark the two other cards so the Asus RTX 2070 ended up going back and forth with the EVGA GTX 1080 SC2 in the tests but ended up just ahead at both 1440p and 4k remember this is a reference RTX 2070 versus an overclocked card but at the same time the prices are about the same at $500 the real question is whether or not the turbo or any other $500 RTX 2070 card will be widely at lunch I have a feeling that they won't be based on our talks with board partners now with the EVGA RTX 2070 XC's is a bit more interesting since for 10% more than the asus card you're getting four to six percent better performance improved cooling results and quieter operation but being interesting doesn't make it a good value it's just less expensive than the overpriced RTX 2070 Founders Edition are takes 2080 and the RTX 2080 TI even with the RTX 2070 that's available right now I think people should still wait and see how the market fares in to 2019 before jumping into RTX because prices are actually a little bit or quite a bit higher than what the 1070 and the GTX 1070 TI used to be at at launch and you know the RTX features that you're paying for right now aren't necessarily available at this at the time of making this video so it's really pointless to jump into a platform that offers or that has features that just can't be taken advantage of meanwhile the performance of these cards aren't drastically or they're not a significant improvement over what the GTX 1070 series cards used to offer for about a year or so and I think that's a problem guys so there you guys have it while the RTX 2070 is finally here it's really hard to get excited about a GPU that costs $500 I'm Eber with Hardware Canucks thank you so much watching let me know what you guys think about this GPU in the comments down below subscribe to our new Boot Sequence channel right over here for the tech news and rumors you can also check out some relevant content over here as well I'm signing off and I'll see you guys in the next one",

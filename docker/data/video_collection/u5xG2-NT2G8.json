    "transcript": "- Today, we are checking out the brand new ASUS ROG Ally, which is a handheld gaming PC that you can take anywhere. I can not wait to check this out. I have already seen a bunch of people posting their unboxings and reviews, and now, we have one here in the studio, so let's open it up. Oh, look at this. Oh man, it looks so good. I love the white, I love the design, the buttons, everything. I love the RGB lights and the joysticks. Ah, okay, let's get it outta here. (packaging crinkling) It looks so great. Oh my goodness. It feels good in the hands. It's nice. It's light too, which is actually surprising, because in a lot of the photos and videos, it looks like you would be very heavy. See what else we have in the box. We've got a 65 watt charger, USBC, and some paperwork. You know, I'll file this away in here, just in case I ever wanna do some light reading. Wow. Nice, long cable because probably gonna keep this plugged in a lot because the battery life, I mean, considering what we have here, I don't think the battery life is gonna be that incredible that I'm gonna be able to just game for 10 hours straight without being plugged in. (upbeat music) It's powered by an AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme Processor with AMD Radion graphics. This should give you enough performance to run most newer games at higher settings with smooth frame rates. It has a seven-inch 1080P display that supports variable refresh rates and it has low-frame rate compensation for tear-free and stutter-free gaming, even at lower frame rates. It has a built in 8,000 milliamp hour battery, which most reviewers say they've gotten around one to two hours of gaming time, depending on frame rate in various settings. Depending upon how quickly you want to rip through your battery life, this will support up to 120 hertz refresh rate. It will go up to 500 nits of brightness, and it also has a Corning Gorilla Glass DXC coating that allows for fewer reflections. I love the design and the look of this. It has an asymmetrical stick layout. It has these flat faced buttons and two paddles on the back. It has 512 gigs of storage and it's also expandable with a micro SD card. This runs on Windows 11, which means you can access all of your favorite games from Steam, Epic, Xbox Game Pass, and more. Armory Crate shows you all of the games that you have installed across all platforms. This makes launching and finding what you wanna play so much easier than having to open all of the separate launchers individually. The command center lets you control your in-game experience with real-time data monitoring, enabling, an FPS limiter, and more. You can also customize your controller to your liking with various key mapping options. There are also some really great accessories like this. This is the ROG Gaming Charger Doc so this will let you connect this to a TV so you can play multiplayer games, and there's even a pro setup that you can connect an XG Mobile, external GPU Monitor, mouse, and a keyboard. They also just released this awesome controller called the Raikiri Pro. It has this built in tiny little OLED display. It's also got dedicated buttons for switching between controller profiles and try mode connectivity, which means you can connect over USB, 2.4 gigahertz RF or Bluetooth. It's designed to work with PC and Xbox platforms and since the ROG Ally is basically a little PC, these two are a perfect match. This thing is so cool and it has me hyped for traveling back and forth between my place and my parents' house when I go to visit them. This is basically like a tiny Windows machine. So you have your Windows login, you've got, like, the Windows task bar, like it really is just a small little PC. This is where it brings in your game library. So this just quickly gives you access to all of your games. So you'll see on Steam, I have a \"Call of Duty\" being downloaded right now. Wait, is it already downloaded? Can I play \"Call of Duty\" right now? Oh my goodness, no, not yet. Okay, wait, yes. Oh, what's happening? Okay, now it's still downloading. I just got so excited. There were so many emotions right there. Oh my gosh. Yeah, that's what we have happening right now. We've got \"Diablo\" and \"Call of Duty\" both being downloaded and it's great because this really does feel just like, it's like a big phone, but a small PC, if that makes any sense. So on the top here, we've got some fans, which are currently blowing out some warm air but it's not that loud. Now, this does have the back paddle buttons which when I'm playing Call of Duty, I've been so used to having these back paddle buttons to crouch and jump, so I'm definitely hyped that this is an option here. It feels pretty good in my hands, like everything. Okay, well I'm, I'm now controlling a YouTube video, which is not what I should be doing, but none of my games have downloaded yet, so as soon as those get downloaded, I'll be able to actually play. So I have Ally connected to my 80-inch TV, and I'm gonna be using the ASUS ROG Raikiri Pro controller, and if you do get this, definitely plug it into the Ally with the USB cable and do an update. Also in notes that if you do get the Ally, there is this little cardboard stand that is easily mistaken for trash. It is not, in fact, trash. It is a little stand. So we've got \"Forza Horizon 5\" loaded up and we're gonna select our car. I think I'm gonna come with the Bronco. No, I'm gonna go with the Corvette. Just a reminder, this entire gameplay is being run off of the ASUS Ally. Like this is pretty incredible. - [Game] Big plans, but first, our superstar is here and she is making her way- - No! Get outta my way, pig. Get out of my way. Shoot, shoot, shoot. Okay, I'll back up. So far everything is running really smoothly, and the thing that I also like about this controller is you can actually adjust how the tension is on the triggers with these little buttons in the back. So I'm going to relax them a little, because in this particular game, you kind of wanna have more trigger control. Let's do it, we're gonna erase. Let's freaking do it. Oh, oh, no. Oh, no. We're going off the track, oh gosh. I'm out of, I'm actually out of control right now. I'm not trying to drift, I'm just trying to drive, but they gave me points, so I'll take it. I missed my checkpoint. (upbeat music) Oh no, let's go, let's go. We're almost there. These tight turns through the city are not my friend. And there we are at the finish line. I finished second place. Not bad. I think there might have only been one other person racing. Maybe that's why. This was actually really fun. I'm pretty impressed with the performance. Let's just remember that this entire game is being run off of this tiny little handheld device and the controller is actually really nice. This is giving you the functionality of the Elite Controller by Xbox. It doesn't have as premium of a feel as the Elite Controllers do, but it's also much lighter. Like the Elite Controller is actually a very heavy device, but this has a nice, very light feel. The little display is actually an OLED and you can customize it. I haven't customized mine yet, but to do that, you just go into the menu. You can add different types of wallpapers and things like that, which is pretty neat. (upbeat music) I kind of have a feeling that this is gonna be like in the old days with the Sega Game Gear. If any of you guys had one of those, the way that you would power through batteries on a family road trip, and then I would be making my parents stop, pull over at a gas station, not for snacks or to go to the bathroom, because I would want some freaking packs of batteries to continue playing my game until we finally got one of the cigarette lighter power adapters so that you could stay charged in the car. Anyways, if you know, you know. This is available to pre-order right now for $700 with a less expensive $600 base edition that'll be coming later this summer. A lot of people have been comparing this to the Steam Deck, which I personally have not tried, but both of these devices are fairly new in this kind of genre of PC handheld gaming market. So from here, this is only going to get better. This is just the start. Let me know what you guys think. I would love to hear from you in the comments below. Have you played with the Steam Deck? Is this something that you'd be interested? Do you think you're just gonna get the Steam Deck anyway even though this is an option? Thank you again for watching. Don't forget to like, comment, and subscribe, and hit the bell to be notified when I post new videos. I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye.",

    "description": "*Today's sponsor: Corsair K55 RGB Pro XT:  (Affiliate link)  When a viewer reached out offering to send over an ATI HD 5770 with a Network Card built in, I couldn't help but ask: Is this the most pointless feature on a graphics card ever?  I terms of the test bed, I used an Intel 11900K, 16 Gbs of DDR 4 3600 Mhz in the NZXT Z590 motherboard.

    "transcript": "Today we're doing a straight-up graphics card video. Something that I haven't really done ina while and I'm quite excited about it. Now thisgraphics card was sent out by a viewer for thevideo and while it is a very interestingGPU, it doesn't entirely make sense to mewhy this thing exists, so maybe later on in thecomment section below we can figure out together why they made this abomination of a graphics card but before we get into that it's time for today's video sponsor Corsair and their K55RGB PRO XT keyboard the Corsair K55RGB PRO XT is more than just a mouthful of a name. It is a membrane keyboard with per-key backlightillumination macro keys that work with Elgato Stream deck functionality. Which if you're into streaming is very very useful. It's also gotdedicated media keys with dedicated volume rocker buttons so I really like that it's also gota windows key lock button, which if you press, means that if you accidentally press the windowskey in the middle of a gunfight in a game it won't drop you out of the game and ruin your life. If all of this sounds good to you check out the link in the description below for the Corsair K55RGB PRO XT. A keyboard that sounds like this *Typing Sounds* *Into Music* The specific graphics card that we're lookingat today is the VisionTek Killer HD 5770 which again, was very kindly sent out by a viewer. Thank you very much! I had... I had a lot of fun looking atthis abomination now this graphics card wasa mid-range-ish GPU from about 11 years ago and we're gonna see how it holds up in gaming today, despite the fact that it hasn't had driver-support for like the last four or five years. So you need to use uh legacy drivers for it which does limit its functionality somewhat but it's still fine you'll see later it runs better than you'd expect considering that it's only got one gig of VRAM and is an oldgraphics card but none of this is why this GPU isinteresting, because if you have a look at the PCB you can see that it's had some weird horrible surgery done to it and it's been conjoined with an ethernet card, for some reason. More specifically a Killer e 2100 gigabit ethernet card you can see on the back here there is literally just an ethernet port right here uh which does work but we'll get into that a bit later. Now this doesn't really make any sense to me because this graphics card, like I mentioned before, came out about 11 years ago, which is quite long ago when it comes to tech, but back then gigabit ethernet was pretty common. Like I can't imagine how many people were buying a mid-range graphics card, 11 years ago, and didn't necessarily have easy access to gigabit ethernet on their motherboard. Like why does this thing exist. If anything in my opinion a wi-fi module would have made more sense, because I feel like wi-fi integration is less common and it's a feature that a lot of people would really like. Now aside from it seeming like a product that was brainstormed on a particularly rowdy Absinthe binge, the ethernet card does present some otherproblems considering the specific killer ethernet that it is, it means that there aren't any easily found drivers that are validated for windows 10. If you're running Windows 7, it's much easier to get this card up and running. But I did eventually find drivers that did work with windows 10 and this killer ethernet card and we'll find a way to test its performance later on in the video butbefore that let's see how the graphics card part of this abomination performs in games in 2021 *groovy music sequence* now obviously, we're going to start off with GTA 5. I'm pretty sure it should be able to run this considering that it wasn't a particularly old GPU when GTA 5 came out. I don't know if you can see, but there's a bit of a weird motion artifact, like it, reminds me a little bit of like using the wrong shutter speed on a camera while filming. The motion looks a bit weird other than the weird motion artifact GTA 5 is very playable next up we have Battlefield 4. I reallylove this game! I used to play so much Battlefield 4, that Anna almost left me, but um yeah this is running really well. We've got 1080p low settings here and this is usable for like multiplayer pvp this is really good. So even one of the bigger maps like 'Goldman railway' runs very well. I'vebeen playing battlefield 4, for longer than I should be now. Just because I'm having so much fun! *Intense music and grunts* DOOM runs less well. Uh, this is not Eternal. Eternalwouldn't work because it's much newer. It's got that weird slow-mo underwater effect that DOOM gets when it's gota low frame rate. So, yeah, I wouldn't, I wouldn't really call DOOM very playable here. Well, surprisingly 'crawling simulator' actually launched! Um I didn't think this was even gonna work at all But yeah! This is, it's running! Not very well. I wouldn't really call this playable, for like a multiplayer PVP game. Okay, let me justassume my natural position in this game. Yeah, he gets it. Quinn man gets it. I actuallykilled someone! It's because I was in this very tactical position that's the only reason I did. I feel like this is how navy seals get around. Hey! Look at this! CSGO at1080p! With what's pretty much competitive settings. Is running way better than I was expecting. Lookat that! Now I normally say that with CSGO, unless you're averaging about 120 frames per second itdoesn't really feel great, for like competitive play. Oh, oh! I just... but I don't know... something about the frame pacing... that I'm getting here makes it feel surprisingly good, despite the low frame rate, you know? Dota runs surprisingly well. We're on the second-lowest preset at 1080p here and yeah And yeah! We'vegot like a hundred plus fps... but to be fair Dota runs well on like a Casio pocket watch so uh yeah it's not really surprising I was actually really surprised at how well this graphics card holds upfor a lot of these games. Yeah the driver support is limiting and it's only got 1 gig of videomemory, which isn't great for 1080p in a lot of situations but this kind of thing really shows the beauty of pc gaming. It's basically got an infinite back catalog of amazing games that you can play on like budget older hardware which is awesome but now we want to see how the network card holdsup. I did think of a way that we can potentially get a better gaming experience using the network card part of the graphics card as opposed to the graphics card part of the graphics card G-force now! Yeah, it works! It's quite blurry though and there's the occasional huge frame drop... oh, big frame drop... many wolves... oh no This is... this is a great gaming experience. Uhm...let me just... just jump away from the wolves and then... this is... this is going well! Oh no, it'sfigured it out. Okay, we're back. We got 60fps again. Come on wolf you're gonna be my wolf B***** Waita minute, let's just see if GeForce now runs any better with the integrated intel ethernet in themotherboard. Uhm, okay never mind, it's just GeForce experience is terrible now. *laughs* It was way betterthan this before like... oh wait! There we go... it's loaded back in. Wow, I remember GeForce Now being way better than this what is going on here! Wow GeForce now, seems to be going backwards. my memory of playing 'Assassin's Creed' was much better performance in visuals than this but maybe the network was just really under load while I did these tests... Uhm, so yeah... Let meknow down in the comment section below a.) Why you think this graphics card exists and b.) if you have any experience with GeForce now which brings me to the end of the video, so thank you very much for watching if you liked the video please do like and subscribe to the channel for more videos like this one go check out our new merch store linked in the description below and until the next video, bye-bye",

    "transcript": "this is a Dell RTX 3080 that I dug out of the bowels of an Alienware system and in today's video we're gonna poke some of its rfsi orifices are a fasodai it's holes [Music] now when I first got my hands on this Dell 3080 I was quite impressed with the relatively low temperatures and noise the card offered although I did notice something interesting about its construction let's do a quick tear down so I can show you foreign it's got this plastic clip on the front that wedges it into the Alienware case I'm assuming so that the car doesn't flail around during shipping [Music] wow it doesn't want to let go I think there's some serious thermal pads on the back here yeah oh oh no oh it's like that thermal putty which is really annoying to replace but there's even a heat pipe on the back plate which is pretty cool [Music] oh I missed a couple screws wow that's quite the thermal paste application now here's the bottom of the cooler I'm not surprised that we've got decent temperatures with it we've got some big heat pipes and a reasonable amount of fin stack it's not a bad cooler and then under that cooler we have this metal plate that makes direct contact with the memory and power delivery to cool it but this plate isn't thermally connected with like thermal pads or whatever to the main cooler and considering the gddr6x runs hotter than the center of the earth I don't know if that's gonna be enough but I guess that's what all the putty and the heat pipe on the back plates for anyway let's have a look under that plate foreign I think there's a lot of thermal pad under here as well because it's not loving the idea of letting go [Music] oh [Music] there we go yeah that's not a whole lot of heatsink but I guess the very inconvenient putty makes up for it right and then we've got our gangrenous PCB with our 3080 die on it and with that I reassembled the card with new thermal pads because putty to get some baseline readings before we thermally connect that plate to the main cooler [Music] wow that Dell 38 is clearly a monster at 1440p high settings with the frame rate on cap we're getting well over 200 frames per second it really is a monster so now I'm just going to spend half an hour gaming and then we'll check the memory attempts to see if they're at risk of spontaneous combustion okay so we were averaging about 90 degrees Celsius with a maximum of 94. now considering that this is memory Junction temp frigidity r6x that's actually not that bad now it's definitely not the kind of figure that would get you laid but it's better than I was expecting although I think we can quite easily get that temperature lower [Music] whoa that back is boiling damn now in Coaster inspection it kind of looks like the cooler makes physical contact with that plate which means the thermal pad thickness is going to be a real problem I'm worried that even very thin thicknesses of thermal pad will cause mounting pressure issues for the GPU die which is exactly what happened when I used the thinnest thermal pad I had between the cooler and that plate the GPU threw a real tantrum okay well that did not go well so I guess we're gonna have to tear it down and figure something else out now the thing is physically there is a very very small gap between this kind of vapor chamber looking thing on the base of the cooler and the actual bit of heatsink that cools the power delivery and the memory modules so I'm kind of thinking instead of messing around with pads and whatever I should just cover it in thermal paste now obviously thermal paste is going to be extremely messy but I actually think it may work so I I am going to try it because you know I don't have any other ideas about how to do this and I'm going to start off by just using a very small little squeeze of thermal paste and seeing if it actually makes contact right I'm just gonna do that [Music] okay and then I'm gonna undo it and see if we have the thermal paste actually spreading on that bit of heatsink [Music] the moment of truth let's kind of Pop the GPU off would you look at that it did make contact yeah I'm just gonna put thermal paste all over it and see what happens why not why not [Music] I don't know that just looks like a thermal paste application done by a three-year-old Adam but I I think it's gonna work we'll see and then in terms of thermal paste to the actual GPU I am going to be using Corsair xtm70 which Corsair sent over according to them this is by far the best thermal paste in the world so we'll see how it compares to the noctuar nth2 that I think was on there before [Music] okay so it's been about half an hour now and I have to say subjectively it has actually felt smoother running like the frame pacing has been better but that could be due to it being a different server or whatever this is online uh but let's see what the memory temperatures are now hey it's actually made a difference we've lost about eight degrees it's not a huge difference but not everything has to make a massive difference it's progress having said that I did have an idea that could get it even lower now high on my small but significant success I decided to push things a little bit further and just thermal paste couple an air cooler to the back plate of the 3080 and see if that makes any difference just for the hell of it unfortunately we do have an air cooler in the system that we're using so I'm gonna Mount the cooler on the back here and I I feel like Mount is a bit of a grandiose term for what I'm going to be doing I'm just going to take this heatsink put a bunch of thermal paste on it and I think the best way to secure this heatsink to the back plate is with some good old zip tie action foreign [Music] okay so it's been about half an hour now and the GPU temps are similar to what they were before but let's see what the it's exactly the same it hasn't really made any difference and with that thank you for watching until the next video bye-bye [Music] [Music] all right",

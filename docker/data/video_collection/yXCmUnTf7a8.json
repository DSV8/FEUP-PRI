    "transcript": "- About a year ago NZXT came out with the H510 Flow, but now they've got the H5 flow, they've dropped the 10, I don't know why, let's take a look and see what the differences are. 'Cause honestly I have no idea And they've sponsored this video today, So we're gonna do an all NZXT build in this thing. In case you don't know NZXT, they're a company that's kind of been around for a while now. They've been making cases, and some other peripherals for years, and they're starting to like, make more and more. They're gonna make everything. I think we're missing a couple parts today, to make this like truly all NZXT, but it's pretty close. They actually just released a new air cooler, and I'm really excited about it. So we're gonna try it today. Aha, one of the major differences, this weird angled fan down here. It's supposed to provide better cooling, primarily for your GPU, and it's not present on the H510 Flow. The other major difference, actually now that I'm looking at it, is this is finally fixed. This bugged the hell outta me when building it at the last time, is that all they've got room for is a 120 at the top here. Now, it's fully open. We can fit at least a 240 up here. Lots of options, whether you want to go AIO or air cooling. Looks like this is also covered now, instead of being perforated. There's the old cable management, and here's the new cable management. And this is actually great. I don't like these small grooves in the separators and stuff, just give me like a big channel area, like they've kind of done here. Oh, and I actually like their slot covers. You see how these are perforated, when you go and you set up your airflow, if you've got negative pressure or whatever, and it's pulling in, you're gonna end up with dust and stuff trying to get in through here. In the past, I've actually taped over that, and then sticker bombed it, so that there wasn't any dust coming in from there. 'Cause you want it all to come in through like here, or through here. Yeah, they've got a nice screen, right behind this big holy mesh here as well. So yeah, I kinda like that. Let's build a computer. Goodbye, H510 Flow. Now H5 Flow is my new best friend. Motherboard, motherboard, we got fans. Hey, vertical GPU mount. We're gonna need the SSD. This is the T120 RGB. I'm actually really excited for this. We're gonna go with the core i5-12600 K. We don't need you mister Z63 RGB. The puck for cable management maybe. Oh, they make a mouse now, we got the lift. Signal 4K30, what's this thing a capture card? Whoa, the Z690 is all the way at the bottom. (laughs) Okay, we'll open there. Z690 board, it's all white, It's got this nice motherboard armor that's gonna match this case like perfectly. (bag plastic crunching) I like when they do the foam inside the bag, it's really good. Whoop, whoop. oopa gangam Get outta my cardboard, and into my motherboard. Give it a wiggle, put the lid down, close it, let's get the memory in. Ooh, we got some all white memory. Beautiful, 16 Gigs DDR4-3600 C16. Here we go. What've we got here some fan, and some RGB. We just been told that this cooler also comes in a non-RGB version, in either color, if you don't want that. People are gonna crucify me and say, \"Hey, you're using too much thermal paste.\" To you I say, no amount of thermal paste is too much. (laughs) Yeah, before I install the cooler, I'm gonna get this motherboard armor off. How do you come off, do you just pull off? All right, perfect. We got our Crucial P1. It took me a little while to find the label. It's a 1TB NVMe drive. I can't remember if this is gen 4. Yeah nope, Gen 3, but that's okay, It'll still be pretty fast. So this guy goes on top of that. You know the reality is gen 3 speeds aren't that terrible, and until direct storage actually becomes a thing that PC games are using, gen 3 drives are totally fine. Lttstore.com. Oh, this is actually a little annoying, but if you're gonna give me metal bits for the AMD stuff, give me metal for the intel stuff as well. Intel's not compatible with metal. Yeah, it looks like it just sticks on here. It's just stuck there, so we don't have to worry about like holding it, and slowly sliding my finger out. I love paper that folds lots, it's like maps. It brings back those thrown away memories of trying to fold the map back, while your father yells at you because you can't fold the map properly. (laughs) I should, at this point, be able to just slap it down into those standoffs. give it a little smoosh, it just just stops as soon as it's done. Really easy to install. I'm not gonna lie, I do hate these clips. But that's not NZXT's fault, everyone uses these clips. The regular version of this guy without RGB, is about 50 bucks, and then the RGB version is 60. Where's the power supply? Oh okay yeah, this is the heavy box, and that's how I know the power supply is in here. Why do we have two power supplies, that's crazy. We're not doing two builds. It's beefy, but it's a 1000 watts. This is a little overkill for our build. Ooh, this is cool. I am an absolute sucker, for colored stuff. Even if the power supply is all black, I love that this comes in a big purple carrying case. This is probably one of the more premium cable cases I've ever seen. Oh it's minor, but I like that their warning stuff is also purple. Give me a purple power supply, like please. I know I never see it, I don't care, I wanna see a purple power supply when I slot it into my computer. Oh my god, we got the path. (laughs) It's beautiful, I'm not gonna show you why, until I unbox it, but I'm very excited to use this. All right, what do we got? PCIe, I love how the express part of that is a lowercase e. But what I wanna see is, no. So it's a side load. On some cases, what you're gonna have is a plate that attaches to your power supply, and then you load it all through here. This doesn't have that, so it's gonna side load in, and, we're also gonna make sure our fan is pointing down, so that it gets intake from the bottom here. I'm really curious to see how this goes, I've never seen that before. I've never seen like an angled fan like that. Put it in there, (fan insertion scraping) Oh baby. Wouldn't it look cool if it was purple right now? (laughs) So let's plug everything in. That's two screw, one screw, two screw, red screw, blue screw. I'm gonna take my CPU connectors, and I'm gonna run 'em through the top now. It can be really hard, to once the motherboard is in here, try to run them up through the top, and then plug them in. If I didn't put this cooler in first, this would be easier. I'm stupid. You know a lot of people hate the ATX connector, or the USB connector, I hate the EPS connector. Be careful when you're doing this. Like I'm being careful, and I'm not damaging the board. You're not gonna damage much, but just don't like, put it down and then move it. 'Cause then you could scrape stuff off the back. Now we just slide it back, slide it in, pop into place there, ah, perfect. Oh, one nice thing is about this motherboard from NZXT as well, it's got a built in io shield. M3-Kb5, I want the 6325 millimeters. I like that they're all packed in these separate nice little packs here. Now I can't fit the screwdriver in between the EPS connector, and the io shield. I mean the reality is, I could call it a day there, and it'd be okay. We've got like four screws in, that's okay. At this point we pretty much just need the GPU. Let's put 1140 in the front, how about that? RGB. (computer synthesized echoing) Gotta cut the plastic tape. (speaker singing) Yeah, I'm cutting it towards me, don't worry about it. Same thing with the fan, I'm gonna run everything through the back first, and then I'll run it up through whatever cable management hole makes the most sense. So you can go out through here, out through here, oh, here comes the train. (imitates train horn blaring) Of course this is like a really hard to screw in thing too. I'm trying to break my habit here, where I put bits in my mouth. That's usually where I keep 'em, easy access. (laughs) Oh okay well that case fan is installed, which is pretty cool. This is gonna hang there, that's okay. Oh I actually... Okay, one thing that's I just noticed about the motherboard as well, it has a reset, and a power button, that's great. I'm a big fan of that. Here's our HD audio connector. We're gonna throw that in the back, and then put it just up through here, and into the HD audio. One way to tell if your HD audio is plugged in the right way, it's almost always got HD audio written on the top, almost always. Now we'll do our USB. Actually, where is our USB connector? I honestly don't see one. Oh it's on the side. Real easy to get this one in, it's notorious for pulling out though, just like me. - [Camera person] No. (all laughing) Probably my favorite thing, about NZXT cases, you cannot screw up the start, and reset switch in the HTD, 'cause it's all in a little F panel connector here. A little hard to get to 'cause of the motherboard armor, but it'll all be worth it in the end, 'cause it's gonna look super pretty. I guess my only complaint, I kinda wish the motherboard armor was something that you could like put on after the fact, because I like looking at everything before I do all of this, and right now it's hard for me to find the front panel connector. I've gotta like go down and look for it instead of just seeing it right there. I have the power. (computer synthesized echoing) Oh okay, that should be set to ON already then. Yeah, all our fans are spinning. Oh this one's not, one minor thing but the pre-installed case fan on the bottom, the angled one, is that it's not PWM, it's just 3-pin, like it's just for extra cooling, so you don't really need PWM on it anyway, should be fine. (air wooshing) Aye, I'm back. I took some new (air wooshing) merch photos with the new color block, short circuit sweater. I also realized that I completely forgot to put the GPU in. Here's what I was talking about before. And I'm sorry if this kind of like steals the show a little bit, it's just so stupidly pretty. I am personally a big fan, because it's amazing. (laughs) - [camera person] Ah. - It's got all these like crystals, and these glow with RGB too when it's all turned on and whatnot. You absolutely could, vertically mount, and you can actually even get a kit from NZXT, it costs about $90, comes with a gen 4 riser, that's not too bad. Bell was just commenting on how clean the solid slot covers looks, and I totally agree. I actually really like that, and I kind of want more cases to follow suit. We're gonna put on a nice, beautiful, tempered glass, toolless-panel here. The black version, has a tinted tempered glass window. So, if you're one of those kind of people, who doesn't like tinting on tempered glass so that you can like really see the inside, you might be stuck with a white case. That being said, maybe you get a friend who doesn't want a white case, but he does want the tint, you just swap. Okay, let's use their cable management. Put our fan stuff right there. (speaker singing) Cable management, oh yeah. (speaker singing) Cable management, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Just noticed now as I went to put away the EPS connectors, there's the side channel here. I actually love this, there is very rarely, both a Velcro strap, and a little like spot for them to just kind of hide away into. That looks awesome. (speaker singing) I wanna be, a cable managed PC baby. 'Cause you know what? The real goal, isn't to make it look pretty. The real goal, is to make the side panel close. (laughs) Well, not like that it won't. Aye, there we go, cool. There's a bit of a bulge, but that's all right. (laughs) B-B-B-beautiful. (tape ripping) (speaker imitating ripping) That is a gorgeous PC. You know it would really fix it up a bit, taking these cables, and getting CableMod cables. It's fine though. Let's boot it up. (speaker singing) Boo boo boot it up. NZXT, if you're listening, I know you're watching, please give me a reversed case. I love putting my PC on the left. I can't tell you why, I just do. There's dozens of us though, dozens. (upbeat piano music playing) This thing looks gorgeous. Oh, I'm gonna take off the caution sticker. I do love that they got purple on the caution sticker. I want colored motherboards to come back dammit, please. Honestly, it looks pretty good. I think the only thing I would do, is I would actually get a second fan for the CPU cooler, if only for symmetry, and just to hide some of the mounting stuff on the back there. Otherwise everything looks really nice. I plugged everything into the back, it's what I like to do. But on our top io we've got a headphone jack, we've got a USB-C, and then we've got USB A type... (buzzer buzzing) We've got a USB (static rustling) Pho... USB-C, USB-A power button, as per usual. It actually lights up too. Overall I really like it. I'm still not sure how I feel about the angled fan on the bottom, but it's fine, like it's not in the way or anything like that, it doesn't look bad. Let's check out CAM, 'cause we got CAM installed, 'cause NZXT uses CAM. We've got our RTX 3070, and then if you click on them, it actually gives you more information. So this is actually really cool. I like how it's got code name Alder Lake. Oh, I actually really like how it's got our bio stuff right here. XMP probably isn't enabled right now, but that's okay. Yeah, this is really cool, games. Oh, it'll tell me how much I'm gaming? That's actually... I'll never show my girlfriend that stat. Okay, so they've got an Overclocking feature that's currently in Beta. It seems pretty easy, I can just go change core clock, change memory clock, change power limit, AIO pump, everything set to silent, it's pretty quiet. I can get notifications, that's actually pretty cool. Mini mode? Ah, there's an \"if this, then that\" app, IFTT. It's within NZXT CAM, if this, then that. You can use it to do a bunch of stuff like change the profile, when your GPU temperature rises above X degree. Or you can get a storage usage and email alert, or change your profile when network traffic drops below like whatever amount of kilobits per second, so that you can like instantly note, whether certain things are happening. You can find out more in the description. There you guys have it, that's the H5 from NZXT. You can get it for 95 bucks if you want the regular version, And then the elite is 140. Thanks to an NZXT for sponsoring this video, comment, subscribe, all that good stuff, and I'll see you later, Bye-bye.",

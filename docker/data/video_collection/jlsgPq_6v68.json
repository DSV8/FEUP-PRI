    "transcript": "- This is the apple studio display. Also known as the LG ultra fine 5k expensive edition. It's basically the same specs. It's got slightly brighter. Max brightness I think. It's got the same IO I think. It's basically an LG ultra fine 5k, but with a twist. Not only does it have Apple's wonderful, industrial design, but it also has, what is it? An A13 bionic in it? It's apple silicon in the display. Why would you need that? Well, it's well, basically it's a giant iPad. Apparently it even runs iOS like iOS 15.4. which is ridiculous. - You Got to like activate siri with it. - You can do that anyway with a standard microphone. It doesn't matter. You don't have to use an a 13 bionic in your display in order to activate Siri. Anyway, let's get into it. In this case, this box is design is a amazing. So what you do is you just grab these. Give them a little push. Aha, Yeah It's like this for the produce display XDR as well. So it gets everything outta your way and you can just grab it. Okay. So let's see what else is in here. This is probably the power cable. No, that is the thunderbolt cable, which can supply power. I think it can do up to 95 watts and we got the apple stuff. We got studio display pamphlets. Nice black apple logos. Where's the power. It's not in the box. Oh, so they managed, they put it. It's actually a nice cable. Does it come out? Is it hard please? Don't don't tell me it's hardwired. Please tell me that I'm just like running into resistance from this being tied over it. I don't remember now what the back looked like. In fact, I don't remember if they showed the full back. Oh, that's in there. That's not removable. That's that's not removable. Not at all. - This thing is attached. - Oh yeah. Oh, that's - So stupid. - Last time I saw power permanently attached to a monitor. It was a tube. Oh - I'm not old. I'm sorry. - Even the, some of them had detachable cables. So if your cat or your dog or your vacuum cleaner, choose up this cable. You are SOL. Now I know why they put it there. They, they didn't have any choice by the apple care. Let's let's forget about this for now and move on to the rest of the IO, such as it is. We've got a single Thunderbolt input. That's it? And then you get three USB type CS. I think these are each tangular for a second. If I'm not mistaken. So apple clearly doesn't want you to daisy chain these displays. In order to get multiple of these you need to take up each one of your quarts and you had to plug them in individually each time. Like what, why is it thunderball three? Oh, I can think of why, because they put the, a 13 bionic in there and the a 13 bionic doesn't have the bandwidth for it. For a $1,600 product. You would expect it to be as seamless as possible, especially for something that apple like keeps talking about. Oh, well look at how simple it is. You just plug everything into your monitor and Hmm - Wait, it's it's built in. - Oh yeah. - If you think about how the, the back plug on an iMac looks I thought for sure. Oh, that's just a similar sort of plug with the crazy magnetic connection - You would think so, because this is a like more expensive than the base volume Mac. This is obviously not the nano texture glass. Oh, that is a very nice peel though. It feels real nice. The nano texture glass compared to this would be, I'm not gonna say extremely Matt, but it would be very much less reflective. Like, I'm pretty sure if I turned it this way you'd just straight up see the camera. This is not removable either. Just in case you were wondering, this is the the tilt stand. There is nothing else to it. It just does this. So in the factory, you need to have either the VESA mount. If you have an arm that you wanna put this on or this or the height and tilt, that's $400. The pro display XDR at least had the courtesy of having a quick detach mechanism that it was really nice. This has nothing. It's literally just the stand. This is unacceptable - This better be the most beautiful display ever. - I don't think it will be. However, in order for us to find out, I'm gonna have to turn it on. And before I do that, I'm going to talk to you a about our sponsor devolution. Thanks to devolutions for sponsoring this video. IT pros disagree on a bunch of things, like Kirk versus Picard or DC versus Marvel. And how can we forget windows versus Mac. Am I right? There is one thing that millions of IT pros around the world agree on. They trust devolution server to manage all of their privileged accounts and remote desktop manager to centralize all their remote connections and credentials on a single platform, which is securely shared between users and across the entire team. With devolutions, you don't have to choose between productivity and security you can have both. Learn more and launch a free trial @devolutions.net or we're at the link below. Does it do a display on thing? Does it do anything? Does it show anything? Does it, oh, it does. It's booting iOS. How interesting. Oh, there's fingerprints all over it already. The most expensive micro fabric cloth. Well, it works pretty well I guess. Let's start off with the easiest to, I guess start off with the iPad. Log in that in there. It is charging. - Is it just like connecting? - I don't know what's happening. Oh, now my touches just went through. That was fun. Let's try that again. Oh, Hey, there we go. That was weird. Oh, that's interesting. So you get separate controls for the brightness of the external display and the iPad but the brightness of the external display doesn't adjust. Okay. So yeah, the, the general brightness in normal viewing conditions is more or less the same and the color accuracy looks pretty decent compared to the the iPad itself as well. Sharpness seems okay. Even though this is a different kind of signal like it's just actually getting scaled. Oh, right. It's got those super amazing speakers. Let's crab rave it and wait where's my volume control. Oh, that is okay. This looks very much like two brightness controls. Is it not? That's what I thought that was. It's the speakers. It's a bit harsh on the top end. The base is pretty good. As you might expect from the speaker arrangement. That's similar to the iMac 24 inch. But man, that top end was really rough. Like it was actually a little bit fuzzy. It's more balanced. It sounds better at the top end. Like it's, it's way tighter. The base obviously isn't as strong or quite as nuanced, but base isn't everything. I wanna find something good about this display. Aside from the fact that it's like similar in terms of brightness and color accuracy to the iPad at least in standard content, let's find some HDR content. You know, it actually doesn't look terrible. The blacks are actually really good for an LCD. Like this is a mini LED array that is far superior. And it's similar in terms of black performance. Well, I guess it's a little bit worse on the studio display actually. The HDR tele mapping does look really good though. Even though it's not actually an HDR display. Now it's time for the Mac experience. I expect will be a little better. I mean obviously this is what it's kind of designed for. The iPad won't even now put the right resolution. So I can adjust the brightness here. It also has automatic brightness adjustment. I can adjust the color presets. Yeah. The HDR to mapping looks real good though. And the color vibrancy is really good. Is it $1,600 good? You can get similar performance or better, out of monitors from other companies. What apple is really doing here that is different. It does the webcam and microphone and everything on the display. So let's try that. All right. So now we are recording from the studio display. The webcam light has lit up. Looks pretty good. Like I'm in pretty good focus here. And you can see everything in the background as well. And if we look closer, yeah there's a little bit of noise in the image. But like that's that background detail is well it's in shadow. And B it's very much in the background. This is the webcam that's built into the MacBook pro. Oh yeah there's less noise in the background. Okay. Now there may be less detail in the background too. I don't know. I haven't compared these side by side other than just kind of looking at them while we're doing this recording. I wanna see if this actually has similar video and audio quality with the Intel Mac. Wow. Is QuickTime just like not loading or something. I can't tell if that's better or worse. It might be the same. So it might actually be getting the same processing as the M one Mac was getting as well. Tell me what you feel about the power cord. - Are you serious right now? I am on a two week streak of having no hot takes on the land show. And I'm afraid that it is about to end because I am angry. - Yeah. - Okay. (mumbles) - Every person that walks by, Hey, Hey, tell me how you feel about this connection to the monitor back there and the power cable. - Wait what? We can unplug it. - What? No, I don't want, this - Is the processor cool. Yeah. Like so much stuff you could do where the process are built into the display. You could like do AI up scaling for lower resolution content. You could de-noise internet streams. Cause you're talking directly to the operating system. They have a channel of communication. There's no airplay. There's no apple TV. There's, there's nothing. It's it's supposedly running iOS 15.4 in there. And I don't understand how they dropped the ball this badly. I wanted, I went into this thing being like, oh yeah well it's basically this other monitor. But it's got these other cool features. But holy crap did this disappoint me. Are you ready for the weekend? I think I'm ready for the weekend too. If you're ready for the weekend make sure you get subscribed to short circuit because we release videos like this all the time and you're not quite a as angry as this but videos like this all the time.",

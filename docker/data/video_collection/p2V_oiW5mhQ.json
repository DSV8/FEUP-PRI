    "transcript": "- Kevin Kensen wants to know where are you hiding the Xbox Series X and what hours can I break into the office to get it? - Okay, so we do not have a Series X yet. - But we gonna get one, we gonna get 12, thanks Jeff. - Anyway, hello, welcome to this is, it is a very special day because we have the full details on the Xbox Series X. - In terms of performance, how do you think it's going to compare it to the PS5? - Well, considering that we have no official information on the PS5 performance whatsoever, I think it's a complete guess. If I were to posit a wild guess, I think that the Xbox Series X is performing probably better. Sony have access to the same core building blocks that Microsoft have, right? So they're using those same Zen 2 cores. They have what I'm sure is the same RDNA 2.0 graphics, the differences is that how they decide to build it, right? And I think that Microsoft seem they're being pretty aggressive on not only like the size of the GPU and obviously having all eight Zen cores but also the clock speeds that they're pushing. - So people want to know, will we get VR? - Probably not so what we know right now is that Microsoft doesn't really care about VR at the moment, or at least on the Xbox side of things. There's nothing stopping this from happening if they want to, right? The hardware is absolutely powerful enough to handle VR furniture across the board. It meets all the kind of minimum specs that you would expect but we'll see maybe a couple of years would be crazy for Microsoft to include support because I don't think it would be insanely difficult but also it requires a lot of marketing, a big sort of investment from publishers and stuff, possible not happening in the algo. - Also feels weird they've really gone away from connect. So to move away from that and then to move into VR, it seems like they just wanna say \"No, we're going to do traditional\"--- - Fewer gimmicks man. I feel like after the Xbox one launched with the slightly rocky start, I think that they're razor focused on gaming, on performance and what this new console can do. Anything else like VR that may come in the future would be a huge gimmick and would be a huge distraction right now. I think they're being very smart about the way that they've launched this console so far. - The Xbox Series X GPU, is it a sneak peek to the big Navi AMD cards? - Well yes, although I don't even think it would be NAvi anymore because actually RDNA 2.0. - Right. - So inside the series X, there are actually a few improvements over current generation PC technologies specifically on the AMD side. So it is the first GPU to take advantage of our DNA 2.0. So this is an actual step forward compared to the Navi GPS that we have today. So I don't have the exact number off the top of my head. But if you compare the GPU inside the series X to what you get on say like a 5,700 XT, which is currently the biggest, most powerful AMD Navi GPU they make, it has more CUs and runs at a fairly similar clock speed. It's right in that right Ballpark. So at a base level is more powerful. Like if you look at like Teraflops, it's what, nine versus 12 or something like that. But beyond that, the fact is that the RDNA 2.0 architecture has a lot of additional features, Ray tracing, better just general performance. So a Navi Teraflop versus RDNA 2.0 Teraflop are not the same thing. - Anything about the variable Refresh Rate? Don't be looking at your watch. You're supposed to be in theater mode. You're supposed to be in theater mode. - I forgot to turn on my watch. Well, so actually it's not wildly different than the already built in support in the Xbox one and the one X. With the Series X, you can run all the way up to 120 frames per second and I assume that the freezing cranes will therefore go all the way up. Mind you, you still need to have a display that can support 4K 120 or even theoretically 10A 120 I think would work. - But it's not gonna work with 144 Hertz display, right? That's where it's gonna differ from the PC side? - Well it depends, theoretically it might because I think they have technically the bandwidth, there are a lot of things they can do with the next box However, every single additional feature and option they add, then needs to be supported by developers and stuff, it gets really complicated, I think for simplicity sake, they're probably is gonna be, okay, cool. Here are your two resolutions or three resolutions. Here are your couple of frame rate options and they just leave it like that. - If theoretically can do 8K but a developer is not gonna be-- - We're not-- - we're not gonna see AK for a while. - I'd be amazed if we see AK games. Short of something like a pixel game or something super, super basic. - Right. Why do you still need batteries for the controller? - This is one I would love to have answered for myself. - Look that. - When we walked into the room, right? It was a very cool sort of design center where Microsoft built all the prototypes for stuff that's not coming up for years and everything, I walk in, I'm \"Oh there's the controller\", they're giving me the whole spiel explaining and everything. I had the controller in my hand and it took everything in me not to flip it over and open up the battery door. \"Ken, what was that?\" According to the Xbox guys, a lot of people still enjoy using brains- - And I'd love to meet the dozen people who actually like using them. - They said it was much more even split between a double As versus rechargeables. I always just use the plain charge kit and to before I can use my same plain charge kit from the Xbox one on the Series X, I just feel it's 2020 they should shape the plain charge kit and if you want to use double A batteries, just pull it out. It can be the exact same controllers just as what did they shape in the box and for now at least it's double A batteries. - So what I will give them credit for is that they moved to USBC instead of micro USB. Does it scratch at a Level 6 with deeper grooves at a level 7? - Look man, this thing's plastic. It probably scratches like a level 2 or something. - If you look at some of our b roll, it actually does have some stuff. - Yeah, I'll let you say the material in the specific, the plastic feels almost the same if not identical to the Xbox one X, it's a console. - Will there be a new UI? - I can say that the series X, the UI from my knowledge of it is an evolution of what we have on Xbox one, I think that you can think about it in some ways it's like Windows in that Windows is constantly evolving but it's not necessarily like a new OS from one to another. Just an evolution of that and I think Series X is likely going to be the same. - And I imagine that the existing one X is a wondering that it's all just gonna be unified. Can it run Windows 10? - No. - No. - Is there Ram in the SSD? - Yes, so it's complicated. Obviously even though it's a very fast SSD, you're still talking about orders of magnitude slower than GDTR 6, it's like a few gigabytes per second versus hundreds of gigabytes per second. Obviously any asset comes from the SSD. Everything comes from the SSD to start with. Generally speaking though, the CPU has to roundtrip things like \"okay here's a new asset or here's a new texture, whatever. I have to go to the SSD, get it moved over, then copied over to the G6 memory\". Here there are ways where the GPU can almost call stuff from the SSD and bypass them around tripping. But I'm not a developer. I don't know how robust that setup is. But the idea is that even though you had 16 gigs of G6 memory built in, that you can as a developer take advantage of the SSD for maybe slower things and flush that in and out but I'm not a developer. I don't really know how useful it is and how much it will make a difference. - Can the old Xbox One controller be connected to the Xbox series X? - Yes, so with the exception of probably will connect, pretty much any Xbox One accessory controller, hard-drive, whatever, can go straight into Series X. And from fact the Series X controller-- - Vice versa, right? - Backwards compatible. Well going forward, who knows, right? - Yeah. - But it means like your Series X controller, you literally plug it straight in or sync it straight to an Xbox One just works. So yes, for right now you can literally take, if you have like an Xbox One S or a Series, a One S or One X, you unplug it, you take your Series X, you plug it in, same cable, same figure, a power cable, everything and it just works. - What are the port selections on the Series X? - There are three USB A ports, one on the front, two on the back, they're all five gigabits, so it's pretty much through the exact same-- - exact same ones as before. And so one of the other questions we got, which seemed like people were pretty upset by is there's no HDMI in. - No HDMI in, yes. - A lot of people are sad that was gone. Will USB 3 portable SSD be the same speed as that expansion card? Absolutely not, yeah. - Your Xbox One games on your current external hard drives will work just fine. but Series X games specifically, they need that full speed at the SSD, which means that either has to be installed internally or on one of the expansion modules. - How heavy is the Series X? It's not that bad. So it's about 10 pounds. So for reference, I think One X is about eight pounds. So mean it's not as dense as the One X. It's bigger, but it feels not the much heavier, it's fine. Honestly it's a little bit lighter, especially knowing all the stuff it's inside, a little bit lighter than I thought when I first picked it up. - Based on first impressions, does the airflow matter if you put the Series X on its side? - No, so there's obviously some slight convection. Obviously he just naturally arises, but really it's pretty well channeled so that that fan is sort of pulling air in through the bottom. So it should theoretically you may see very, very slight differences. But theoretically it doesn't really matter if it's sort of horizontal or vertical. It's designed to work. - And they designed a special fan for this, right? - Super custom, 130 millimeter, very sort of complex surfacing on around the actual fan. They did a lot of channel the air flip, if you have to think about it. That single fan is pulling air through obviously the vapor chamber and the heat sink. It's also pulling air through the SSD on the other side and that center chassis and you have to consider that you have that 301 power supply, which also needs air flow. So air is having to move all the way through the console so they have to be very careful with that. So if you say cover the top, it's obviously that exhaust, normally that would cost you two problems. They actually have a little sort of on the backside, there's a little cutout where essentially the air can go out. So even if you actually put something on top of your Series X, you may have some slight overhead heating issues, but at least air is still able to get out someone. - How expansive is the backwards compatibility? - We'll see when it goes live. I don't even think Microsoft has the final number. The idea though is that if it is a game that ran on the Xbox One, it should run on Series X with very few exceptions, but-- - I think they even said possibility of 360-- - Oh no, I want to say that, I mean anything that ran on Xbox one, so original Xbox games, I know for a fact that that is working at least somewhat on Series X. I know their compatibility team are having to double check the thousands of titles that they have, but essentially games like original Xbox games, 360s that are backwards compatible right now. The only reason why games may not work is again connect I think it's probably not gonna come through or if a specific publisher says, \"Hey no, don't let that work on the series X\", they may be able to hold it. But generally speaking, if it worked again, all the backwards compatible games that worked on Xbox one go straight over to the Series X. - All right, so those were your questions. - Hopefully you guys have been ex-boxed out. So I know that it's been a very exciting couple of days here, but I think there's a lot more to come over the next year. We haven't even gotten a lot of NextGen game play. - Right. - There's a lot more that we have to take a look at, so make sure to subscribe here on this is until next time a Sony where you at? - Don't send me 12 Tony's. - You've said that joke so many times. Jimmy's going to be so mad that he has to cut all of these references out now. - I said, don't send it. I want an expert. - You're making a reference to the 12 joke again. - Let's do another one then. - No, it's fine. Jimmy asked you that .",

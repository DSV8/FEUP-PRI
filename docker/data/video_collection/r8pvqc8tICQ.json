    "transcript": "hey guys Eber here with Hardware Canucks and today Razer announced their new blade studio a lineup of notebooks now it's really interesting about this particular lineup is it Razer is actually implementing in videos new Quadro RTX graphics cards what does that mean well if you're really into series content creation like if you're working in a studio environment particularly movie industry or if you're someone who's you know particular workflow requires heavy cuda processing or if it requires a lot of CUDA cores and of course if you're getting into ray-tracing and development all that kind of stuff this is something that you might be interested in so let's take a look at the blade studio right after message from our sponsor huge thanks to fan text and SteelSeries for making Computex 2019 possible ok so I do need to give you guys a little bit of context as to where the blade is to do a lineup of notebooks stack up within the rest of the notebook competition you see this is not really a gaming notebook because of the hardware that's featured it's really like I said gear for a lot of people who are serious about their you know particular workflow so if you're working with a lot of rendering programs or if you're you know in a movie industry not to mention considering the power that these notebooks feature I don't think it's gonna do that great in terms of battery life plus it's also not a significant update in terms of design from the existing mainstream laptops and what do I mean by that well as you can see by these press images the blade studio 15 and the blades 317 come in this anodized white mercury finish unfortunately you're not gonna be getting the matte black variant I like what you can find on the blade 15 and the plate pro 17 notebooks which are getting the mainstream options that razer offers what really matters is the specs inside so the starters the 15 inch notebook will feature a core i7 and 9750 h 6 quart welter at CPU so the same found on the blade 15 but the 17 inch notebook will feature the core I 9 98888 core 16 threaded monster so that's 2 extra cores compared to the blade pro 17 notebook and do keep in mind that this is a 45 watt CPU so cooling is certainly something that I'm interested in I mean considering the size of the chassis it shouldn't have a problem but I'm interested to see how far it can or how well it can cool this core i9 chip but at the same time I'm also interested to see how the clock speeds bear and you know in this setup considering that it's eight cores and sixteen threads the reason I say this is because Apple just recently rolled out this new eight core 16 threads chip into their MacBook Pros and from the recent performance analysis that I've been looking online it just looks like the chassis just can't handle the powerful CPU something else that really caught my attention is the new blade student lineup of notebooks don't have support for Intel Xeon processors or ECC memory support and I feel like ECC is pretty important especially for serious content creators because if you're rendering you know intensive 3d assets or something like that ECC memory can come in super beneficial and I'm certain I'm pretty sure that certain applications will take advantage of ECC so it is interesting and if you're someone who's working in the creative industry let me know your thoughts about you know whether or not if ECC memory is valuable particularly in your workflow the rest of the specs includes 32 gigabytes of RAM that comes standard but it can be upgraded up to 64 gigabytes it also starts at a 1 terabyte and via mean storage although do keep in mind that the 17 inch variant might have an extra hand to slot 4 expandability just like the blade pro 17 the display on the blade 15 studio is a 4k OLED panel at 60 Hertz or asked one on the blade 17 studio will feature a 4k OLED panel at 120 Hertz now this is an interesting implementation because when we checked out the plate 417 those laptops are only being offered in 1080p variants at a high refresh rate and now something with a higher resolution so I feel like Razer was sort of planning this whole thing out with rolling out high resolution displays with their pro or their 17-inch notebooks later this year and it looks like we're only getting OLED the other thing that really is really really really weird is that as a content creator myself I don't see Olin and particularly interesting because as again a content creator OLED is definitely too saturated and I don't think when I'm grading or color grading videos I'm gonna get the accurate implementation or the accurate representation when I'm you know doing that stuff so especially for people who are serious into doing color work or whatnot I feel like the OLED option might be a bit too aggressive so I want to hear your thoughts about that in the comments down below do you think OLED is really necessary for a notebook port selection looks pretty decent at least from the press images that you're seeing there is power in three USB 3.1 gen2 ports done about three ports but do keep in mind that the blade studio 17 will feature a UHS 3.0 card reader whereas the blade 15 studio will not which is disappointing basically the new studio lineup of notebooks look exactly the same as what Razer is offering with their mainstream laptop or mainstream options which I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing I mean I personally like the way how they look but again you know what you have liked to see Razer's sort of tweak the design here and there a little bit would love to know your thoughts about that in the comments the main star the show here is the implementation of Nvidia's new RTX quadro GPUs and this is particularly interesting especially from a company like Razer who's trying to target a different type of audience not necessarily gamers because if you're really looking for a gaming laptop you probably are well better off with a geforce r-tx GPU rather than something like a quadrille graphics card because quad rows are really good for like I said serious people who are working in professional environments like studios or rendering 3d assets that requires all of that hardware but this will certainly push the price of the studio line up of laptops because if you look at the desktop market the Quatro 5000 has more than 3000 CUDA cores and it puts it right between the $700 RTX 2080 and thousand-dollar r-tx 20 DTI however it costs about $2,100 and it actually makes me wonder how much of the price premium we could expect by implementing a Quadro GPU inside a laptop the other thing that's important to me or something that I should mention is that as a content creator myself you know making videos and of course using programs like Adobe Premiere and DaVinci Resolve I don't particularly see Quadro as a real investment because you know the RT X GPUs are well taken advantage of especially intervention result so you know quadrille doesn't look like it's gonna add a super substantial increase in rendering performance or playback performance because the current Arctic's hardware is plenty enough for content creation like making videos but like I said there is a specific type of user that might take advantage of all the hardware that quadrille offers and I think that's what Razer is trying to approach here now we did inquire about pricing for the new blade studio lineup tops but unfortunately Razer wouldn't tell us anything I mean all they did mentioned was that they were going to be very expensive so I guess we'll just have to wait and see how much they're gonna cost when it's officially available and I get it I mean they're trying to compete against Apple and their MacBook Pros with what you know they're offering the provector graphics and of course at this point you're getting an 8 core 1630 CPU so you know if it configure a MacBook Pro to its best you will be easily spending at least 6 grand or more and you know I think Razer is trying to kind of catch up and compare or compete against those markets so like I said there are a couple things that concerns me one is of course temperatures I'm really interested to see how that a course 16 credit CPU can perform in that 17 is chassis it should be okay but hopefully I'll bills get my hands on one of those and secondly I'd like to see extended warranty support for these new professional laptops because pros definitely need that additional support they'll certainly like it because you know Apple offers one of the best customer service out there and they are paying a premium for that so let me know what you guys think about the blade 15 studio and the blade 17 studio do you are you guys interested in this whole implementation of the quadrille r-tx GPUs if so let me know the comments down below I'm Ebor with Hardware Canucks thank you so much for watching and we'll see you in the next one",

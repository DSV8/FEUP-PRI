    "transcript": "well hello good people I'm three tree and the past few weeks we've seen important gaming audio launches like the GSP 670 Sennheiser's first wireless gaming headset I would consider that to be like a semi successful launch and then the Logitech G Pro X and the cool thing about this product is their integration their first integration with Blue Microphones with the introduction of Blu voice functionality in the software but many of you once you heard the sound sample and now ladies and gentlemen the microphone test which seems to be a really important part for Logitech and its integration with Blu voice and many of you were like not impressed with the microphone quality and we've received so many comments to check out the cool master MH 751 and 752 by the way the naming scheme Cooler Master headset but 751 what do these numbers mean I would consider this to be like the sleep or gaming headset because we've done ads on this thing and I've been using it in the background but I did not realize just how good microphone quality is just how good the audio quality is for the price point and for the past three weeks this headset has been on sale for $59 which is an incredible value and if you have the $20.00 premium you get the MH 752 which isn't exactly the same headset and exactly the same microphone but includes the USB sound dongle for surround sound so up until now my gaming headset recommendation under $100 has always been the GSP 300 from Sennheiser with a fantastic microphone great isolation and really good sound quality for a gaming headset but for budget consumers the $59 price point guys the MH 751 is is really good now I will say the headset is based on a tax Star Pro 82 headphone which is highly regarded as a good pair for under $100 and the fact that Cooler Master is able to put in a microphone in here and sure there is no base board adjustment like the only tax Star pro 82 but the fact that the microphone is beating out so many other headsets for such a low price point is impressive so let's take a look after this today's sponsor is pretty exciting because I've actually been using their services for the past four years on and off when I'm traveling stuff to stay protected Nord VPN no way do I upload anything without NordVP in public spaces no way do I receive any NDA information in public spaces without enabling nor

really happy with them no complaints on my end and you get to save 75% off with our HW CYT promo code check out the link below thanks so much alright so outside of really good value at the fifty nine bucks for the stereo version what else does this headset bring to the table so number one I would consider to be my third most comfortable gaming headset that I have in my entire collection the first one would be the games the game one or the PC 37x which is open back and the clamping force is perfect the valori parts I can wear this thing for literally the entire day without any problem number two would be the clothes GSP 300 again the ear pads are fantastic nice clamping force really good isolation as well and then I would consider the MH751 to be in the 3rd place so first they are incredibly lightweight at 280 grams the clamping force I would say is just right but some might consider to be too loose based on like other gaming headsets that really seal everything in there and allow nothing to escape here the clamping force is actually quite light I find it to be really enjoyable for a small head like with some jerky head movement the headset might fall off but say for most heads this would be just fine and the size extensions are quite long look at this reaching all the way to my jawline so so for larger heads this headset would be not a problem the ear cushions are foam and we have nice thick layer of padding on the actual driver wall so if yours do go beyond the ear padding and make contact with that surface it will still be comfortable and not some tiny layer of fabric like we would find on the pro-x for example like I could feel the plastic right there but with the MH751 it is nicely padded new york up swivel 90 degrees so you can leave them on your neck like so without removing the cable the cable by the way is removable with my secure twist mechanism and so is the microphone and while coup master is really pushing this towards a gaming market I love the low profile nature and the discreet all black design you can 100% wear these out doors and nobody would think this is a gaming headset now for the 79 / $89 price point for the MH751 depending on the retailer the USB sound card is actually pretty handy so you can adjust the volume on here you can mic mute you can also adjust the gain on the microphone itself which is great because it is quite sensitive so lowering it is quite good and the 7.1 surround sound toggle it doesn't completely destroy the audio and I feel like it actually pushes the mid-range slightly forward instead of enlarging the audio space so I feel like the soundstage is slightly better when the 7.1 surround sound toggle is disabled but still it's a very powerful sound card so pretty good for notebook users or maybe for pcs that don't have good onboard audio and for the $20.00 premium is not too bad and especially now you can pick up the MH751 for almost the same price as the 751 in some regions so perhaps go for the MH752 instead of the 751 man modeling the only real complaint I have is with the cable since it's braided anything it touches it sends that cable noise directly into your ear cup so it could be touching something by my belt but I'm hearing it right over here and it is just unpleasant for example the GSP 300 has a Robert and anything that happens on it right now is not audible unless something happens actually beside the earcup like right here then it's not able but otherwise can't hear it which is nice while the cable and G Pro X is slightly thinner it's also braided but K both noise anything over here is not audible again unless something is directly interacting within the cable in this area and because the clamping force is so light and heat accumulation inside the ear cup or on the surface of the ear cups will not be as significant as with something like the pro-x that has a much better seal but heat accumulation on that pair is much more I've worn these for two hours today in my room without the window open normally I would feel the hotness and the sweat on other pairs but not here all right so let's move on to the microphone test and this is why so many people recommend this headset this is what you get for $59 this is the most natural sounding value-oriented gaming headset that I've ever heard there is no processing no compression with not too much bass in my vocals it's like it just sounds really good but the downfall is there's no noise cancellation of course since it's not digital and therefore it will pick up all the keyboard strokes anything in the ambient environment and that's just the nature of something that doesn't have those noise compression characteristics what you listen to now is that recorded with the G Pro X headset the latest term Logitech this is a $99 pair and I can sense there's some form of compression happening I don't know if it's happening on a higher end or on the lower end but it just doesn't sound as natural as the coolermaster pair next up is the GSP 300 also $99 headset and this is the one that I recommend for that price point there is a bit of sound compression happening with my voice it still sounds natural a little bit a nice base character it does sound quite similar to the Pro X so let me know between the two which one sounds best to you and finally we have the PC37X a more expensive $129 pair which is based on the game one series and I would consider that to be the benchmark of like good quality microphones that are not crazy expensive on the gaming headset this one's sounds quite natural with nice bass pickup too so let me know between the four microphones which one sounded the bed to your ears and then of course the thing that completes this headset is the sound quality the signature on this one is quite flat across the entire range but also balanced so bass is present but I would say it's flatter than most of the gaming headsets actually quite similar to the base resonance on the pc37x in terms of like you can feel it as the depth but you don't feel it rumbling which is perfectly fine for my own listening I hate when it's rumbling and disturbing other frequencies in the entire range so this might appear flat to you but it's actually quite balanced the mid-range is appropriately placed to create a bit of depth and staging while the high end is super smooth without any fatiguing elements the cool thing I found with this pair is that if I turn up the volume everything is brought up almost equally versus on the pro-x because it's a much brighter sound so like I slightly sharper high high end which I prefer but if I'm listening to really loud volume then it might become a bit too harsh and I have to reduce the volume but then I lose a bit on the bass while on the image seven five one it's kind of it doesn't have that property it's almost like everything is brought up equally and flat which is nice I will say that I do enjoy a brighter sound so a slightly more emphasized high-end but with these the smoothness of everything and being able to turn up the volume to the my preferred high end and that sparkle that I get without really killing the mid-range and without over emphasizing the bass has been a really pleasant experience which I've not when I was not expecting to be honest from Cooler master and for $59 this is an absolute winner clamping force is not too tight comfort level is on point nice ear cushions fantastic microphone that beats many headsets that are much higher price and audio quality it's almost like reference style delivery that I'm personally fine with plus the fact you can wear these outdoors unlike the GSP 300 which is a better gaming headset overall for the $99 price point but they seem to they seem to have better value as an overall package I will also mention the sale price of 59 60 nine dollars for the stereo audition is quite important because the original MSRP is $90 and that is when we approaching it like yeah it's not really worth it but for $59 yes and one more reminder if you're looking for VPN currently check out north VPN using our promo code HWC YT to save 75% off and keep all your online

    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going? Dave2d here. This is the the new Surface Pro 6 from Microsoft and it has received 2 big changes One is a CPU upgrade this year. They've gone to 8th gen CPUs, and the other is an aesthetic change It's now a black or they have a black option and that's something that people have been looking for for a while like some people say Marques matte black all the things but there's a lot of stuff that Hasn't changed on this device. And I feel like it's a product that for some people. It's like should I upgrade this year? Should I not and well, that's what we'll talk about today So first gonna talk about things that haven't changed so it's got the same screen It's a beautiful screen the bezels are present, but it's kind of necessary on a product like this It's running Windows 10 and because of the operating system I do feel like it needs some bezels on the Surface Pro line up the keyboard, trackpad, and the pen input haven't changed great inputs I've never had any real issues with them I wouldn't mind if the trackpad was a little bit bigger, but given the size constraints of the type cover I don't think you make it that much bigger it's got the same kickstand unlimited position so you can fold it back pretty far and that just gives this product a ton of diversity and utility I think that's what makes the surface pro lineup what it is today that really good kickstand these speakers look to be unchanged They're in a good spot. Like they're usable both in tablet mode and the laptop mode They sound clean can't really ask for more The ports however have also not changed and that's something that I think bugs a lot of people this is a device that still does not have a USB C or Thunderbolt 3 port in late 2018 and that is a huge miss in my books now in their defense If you were gonna have a USB C port on this device, you would probably replace the surface connector which is what they're using to charge it and To date, I have not seen a product out there that has a well-functioning magnetic USB C charging system I've seen a lot of companies try but invariably they all suck or at least they're not reliable enough to exist on a surface product Like this and maybe that's what Microsoft is waiting for Like maybe they're trying to perfect that Magnetic power delivery system through USB C and maybe that's when they'll switch over but right now we're stuck with the regular surface connect that being said Without USB-C or Thunderbolt 3, it really limits the full potential of this device because there are tablets out there There are two in one devices out there that do have Thunderbolt 3 connectivity and we've seen what they can do like you can plug like an external GPU and this thing becomes a gaming Beast. I Understand this is obviously not the main demographic of the surface pro lineup But I feel like they should have put one in the pricing is better this year It starts at nine hundred dollars at the base model, but you're getting eight gigs of ram and four core CPU So the product feels like a much better longer-lasting product than last year's surface pro Ok, so things that have changed the finish on this device now comes in a black finish and it looks really nice unfortunately, it scuffs easily any kind of contact with a hard material has a chance to scratch or scuff that black material and it'll show Because it's a matte black. That's the type of finish that shows scratches really easily. If you're gonna pick up a matte black surface I highly recommend picking up a black D brand skin to protect it. It basically looks like the regular product. It's just got some protection Ok, let's talk about performance. The drive on my particular unit is the upgraded one. So it's a 256 gig drive It's an NVME and it performs really well I can't talk about the 128 gig base model, but the 256 upgraded one is pretty fast the CPUs also been upgraded so this year it's running 8th gen Intel CPUs and this units running the i-5 and it's fanless which is a good thing or a Bad thing depending what you're looking for. So this thing is silent. I love that A lot of people are looking for that quiet workspace and this gives you that a fanless quad core I5 is really nice to work with however it can get warm It never gets burnin hot just warm but a fanless i5 is gonna throttle in certain Applications if you push it hard enough so stuff like video editing or photo editing large files can have issues on this particular device Gaming also isn't great. It's running a UHD 620. Nothing crazy light games will run on this device but anything even moderately demanding isn't gonna perform well because that GPU isn't particularly powerful the strange thing is that last year's model like the 2017 surface pro That top end model from last year had a slightly more powerful GPU than this year's top model now a lot of the workflows that are going to be happening on a surface pro product are going to be more CPU dependent than GPU dependent, but for the people that wanted a more powerful GPU kind of missed out this year battery life hasn't changed I'm still getting around eight eight and a half hours and the AC adapters also unchanged it still has that used to be prt on the side which I've always liked, but the overall product is I mean It's an upgrade depending on your workflow. Like if you're doing multi-core heavy stuff that can take advantage of that 8th Gen CPU This is awesome. And also the black color scheme if that's up your alley. This is awesome But I feel like the product overall hasn't changed that missing USB C port or Thunderbolt 3 port particularly a Thunderbolt 3 port would have been really nice and would have completely changed my opinion of the surface lineup in general or the surface pro lineup, but with that at that port I Feel like it's an excellent product for the right person But for most people this is still kind of like a niche to in one product. It can't be like everybody's product quite yet Ok. Hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you like it, subs if you love it see you guys next time",

    "transcript": "so this is the gigabyte aero 15 OLED it's the flagship notebook with in gigabytes Aero series and they've made a few subtle design changes to make it somewhat distinguishable compared to last gen models specifically the classic series which is still available but this is like they're trying to make this more premium version of the Aero lineup now I have the 4k all that option and I've been waiting to get my hands on this unit just because when I looked at it back at Computex man the display was just gorgeous I really wanted to experience it for myself to see what it's like watching videos but at the same time fork wieder like myself can I actually take advantage of something like an OLED display for creating videos so I have put it through its paces I have some thoughts about it so definitely stay tuned for that but I also happen to have the exact same notebook with a 1080p 240 Hertz display so I was really curious to compare by your life and see if you're actually gaining or losing anything switching to a 4k OLED screen now the 4k OLED models start at $1,700 and for that you get a 9 gen core i7 6 core processor 8 gigabytes of RAM at 256 KB by nvme SSD and a gtx 1660 TI the model that I have over here comes with a kora 998 a th k-8 core 16 thread CPU 16 gigabytes of RAM and dual channel mode a 512 gigabyte nbme Drive and an r/t X 2070 max-q GPU and it costs $3,000 just just let that sink in for a moment because it's not cheap it's it's expensive but I'm glad that they're actually giving users the option to configure these notebooks to whatever they like all the way up to 20 80 max-q if you really want that way and so let's go through some of the changes talked about the core i9 performance because this is my first laptop with the high 9 CPU ink core 16 threads that's awesome I think compared to the i7 but most importantly I want to talk about that 4k display is it really worth the upgrade so let's go through that but first a quick message from our sponsor heyo C's warranty just respawned that covers four years general warranty for any defects including a one-time accidental warranty replacement of vagin monitors because sometimes things happen so you can enjoy a super smooth and responsive gameplay just like the warranty check it out below all right so there are a few subtle shifts from the previous generation in terms of design the logo at the front says Aero instead of gigabyte and it's LED lit in white sorry RGB fans the front panel now comes in this two-tone finish with these sharp edged lines that give it a bit of an interesting character but I still preferred the clean design from last year they've redesigned the hinges on the newer models but I'm not really a fan of it guys you see they're way too small to support the whole display and as you can see there is a lot of wobbling going on over here it's definitely a step back from last year's design and I think they did this to expose the front vents for a better airflow plus they've added more vents on the sides so we'll see how that plays out with thermals oh and there's also another air or branding right in the middle of the front mints and there are LED lights pointing at it you know what it reminds me of this I do want to take this time to apologize for something that I mentioned back in our hands on video at Computex when we looked at the OLED notebooks you see we were told that these laptops would come with front-facing speakers but that isn't the case there is still located at the bottom and so I'm not really sure what this front grille serves it's certainly not for airflow I wasn't able to feel any air as I was gaming so don't fool yourselves thinking that that's a fun facing speaker now some quality is passable it's not the best given the location of the speakers the trebles are a bit too sharp base is just non-existent so I highly recommend getting a pair of headphones if you decide to watch movies now the nose cam has been shifted from the display all the way to the frame right above the power button which makes it the worst possible location to have a camera it's stationary which means you can't move it so it's literally gonna point on your fingers and the quality is pretty terrible it's right beside the microphone too which means if you're gaming on it and using the camera and it's just it's a complete fail from gigabyte if you were to ask me I just wish if they relocated that at the top to make it somewhat appealing but this to fail the keyboard layout still remains the same with perky RGB lining with a few handful of lighting effects however the keys that mushy compared to last gen the travel distance also feels a bit shorter as well but it's still pretty good better than my razor blade 15 for sure but I still think 100 legion laptops have the best overall keyboard in the business the trackpad hasn't changed it still comes with Windows position drivers although it's not as smooth or as precise as my razor blade 15 the good thing is that it does come with a built-in fingerprint readers so that's a secure way to login to your PC highly appreciate that asked reports they've shuffled the layout this time but they haven't cut any corners so on the right hand side you have your power in full size UHS 2.0 card reader Thunderbolt 3 type C 2 USB 3.1 gen2 supporting because you're only limited to five gigabits per second versus 10 gigabits per second with Gen 2 switching over to the left we have hdmi 2.0 USB 3.1 type c that also functions as DisplayPort 1.4 another a 3.1 type a a headphone / mic jack and an rj45 port alright so let's talk about that 4k OLED display it's one of the best-looking screens that I've encountered on notebook guys it's sharp very bright so yes you can take it outdoors but keep in mind that it is glossy so it gets reflected depending on how you position the screen and the colors are breathtaking the display is factory calibrated by X right and it covers 100% of the DCI p3 color gamut so it's beautiful to watch movies you get a nice high contrast look with deeper blacks which means there's absolutely no signs of back load bleed given the nature of the panel and for content creators this is like a dream come true but is it really worth upgrading from a 1080p high refresh rate IPS display and the answer to that really depends on how you decide to use your notebook you see if you're primarily a gamer skip the 4k option just go for the 1080p display because the high refresh rate is just the way to go it's fast it's fluid you can't go back to a 4k panel with 60 Hertz it's really limiting especially when gaming plus you can't really game at 4k given the hardware the art takes 27 he still struggles at 4k so keep that in mind but if you're a primary use case is creating videos photos or graphics you're gonna have a blast with this 4k option because having spent time with premier going through the timeline and editing videos just for test purposes and of course watching videos I couldn't take my eyes off of this display it's just that good the colors are vibrant everything about it is just so well done and I don't really have anything to complain about it I particularly enjoyed the deeper blacks on this display that's the one thing that I really appreciated about this OLED panel but it's also the colors too it's just you just sit in front of it and you get to experience it that being said I have a few issues so when I plug in external USB devices if it's like an hard drive or a wireless receiver for my wireless mouse I noticed that the screen flickers for like two seconds and goes back to normal so that was a little bit odd but I also did notice some flickering issues just once in a while as I was browsing to the web and just doing my testing so that is unfortunate I'm not sure if it's just my sample but something to certainly keep note of now for display scaling I didn't really experience any issues with the apps that I use on a regular basis out of the box this notebook comes set to 250% but I really recommend setting it to 200% for the best viewable experience you could set it to 100% for a one to one ratio but then you would need a magnifying glass to navigate around the screen honestly 4k on a 15 inch notebook it is a debatable topic but it's it's about the experience of using one in the first place that's ultimately when it comes down to and I really enjoyed my time using this OLED display but with all of that being said we have to address the elephant in the room and that is burn-in I reached out to gigabyte asking them about what measures they have taken to address this issue and they did mention that they've put these panels through some rigorous testing to ensure that that doesn't happen but it's not a 100 percent guarantee so I guess we're just going to wait and see how this panel plays out over long term so yeah it is what it is upgrading this notebook is pretty straightforward once you open up the bottom cover you have instant access to the two RAM modules which can easily be upgraded up to 64 gigabytes and then you have the pre-installed em to dry which doesn't have the fastest right speed compared to some of the other notebooks that have taken a look at the past you have an additional MDOT to slot for expansion I do want to mention that the killer Wi-Fi card on this notebook was absolutely terrible I had the worst experience browsing through the web and of course playing multiplayer games the Wi-Fi would just drop all of a sudden I would just it the whole thing would just disconnect me which is which was really really frustrating I don't know why could goodbye to sticking with killer Wi-Fi networking card so it just ruins the whole gaming and I guess browsing experience if you want to put it that way now both aero notebooks feature the same size battery so 94 watt hours I ran my standard light load test refreshing a Chrome web page on both the 4k OLED and the 1080p 240 Hertz display and as you can see the OLED ran about 46 minutes shorter compared to the 1080p model and I expected that because it is a 4k display after all and the powers are completely depends on what's on the screen since every pixel is individually lit Plus this model is running an i-9 CPU versus the i7 so that's another factor to consider the same story goes for the heavy load test running real bench on a loop and finally taking a look at performance the Coralie 9/8 core 16 thread CPU is really fast however it's nothing significant compared to the core i7 9750 h6 core processor as you can see the Olman x2 s that i checked out recently is not too far behind in both multi-core and single core tests but man that blender time is crazy though interestingly enough the Aero 15 notebook featuring the core i7 CPU didn't do that great compared to the omen but that's because gigabyte doesn't unlock the full potential of that CPU it gives you a balanced experience without affecting thermals that much remember the omen ran really hot during my testing taking a look at our atonement at premiere pro test I was really surprised at how well the i7 and the i9 performed but I have an explanation for that you see as I was monitoring clock speeds I noticed the core I nine CPU average between 3.1 and 3.4 gigahertz on all eight cores while rendering the video verses 3.7 gigahertz and a little over that on the core i7 model so the higher frequency did come in clutch to close the gap between the two so that's something to definitely keep note of especially if you plan on if you're debating between a core i7 in the core I 9 you're not gonna notice a huge difference between the two in terms of pure rendering performance game II on the other hand was good like I said earlier I wouldn't recommend picking up a 4k model for it but if you are comfortable with sixty Hertz you can certainly get away with over a hundred frames per second in 1080p set to the high settings I was curious to see if the i9 made any difference and as you can see the improvements were very minimal taking a look at temperatures the Corinne I did peak at 95 C but as soon as I hit that point it shifted the clock speeds to bring those temps down to an average above 85 see her casual test the CP was able to maintain above 4 gigahertz and the temperatures were under control the r-tx 2070 max Q ran cooler than last year's model has the core temps peaked at 76 C and the clock speeds were shifting back and forth between 1300 and 1410 megahertz which does align with NVIDIA spec sheet fan noise is certainly not the biggest Forte of the ar-50 notebook it certainly gets loud under heavy load scenarios especially if you're gaming or if you're editing videos because it's trying really hard to cool that coronet processor and the r-tx 2070 max to GPU so I would highly recommend pairing this with a pair of headphones just so you can isolate yourself from all the noise the new Hydra x-series from Corsair is a full water cooling ecosystem with transparent blocks for RGB goodness and built-in flow indicators with soft and hard to being available and the full array of fittings so you can design the perfect loop for you hide your X by Corsair everything's linked below so this brings us to the conclusion and guys I gotta admit I am not really happy with what gigabyte has done here with the newer Aero 15 models because for one the redesign of the hinges is just bad I mean it's small I don't know how far or how long it can support this display because it gets super wobbly so it's certainly something to consider the nose canvas looking it at the worst possible location it's not ideal a complete fail if you were to ask me the speakers are still located at the bottom which they're the front facing the IO is also not up to spec which is really odd especially since you're paying almost three grand for a notebook I mean USB 3.1 gen2 on is pretty limiting especially if you're looking for a notebook with the highest spec it's just kind of limiting but it comes with a full sized SD card slot so I guess that's a bonus they play the safe this time with thermals on Quora 9 they didn't push it to extreme so it's respectable but it's not something that I worth or consider upgrading from the core i7 models because the performance difference is really not that significant not to mention Wi-Fi performance on both these notebooks were pretty terrible and it's of course due to the aquiline or networking cards Intel seems to have the best in the business right now I'm not sure why he came by decided to go with killer in the first place and finally there's a question of whether or not if you should go with the 4k OLED display or the 1080p 240 Hertz display honestly I think I'm gonna stick with a 1080p panel because I love the fluidity and the responsive and the refresh rate in general of the screen it's still a very color accurate display I can comfortably edit videos on it I don't think I can you go wrong with a 1080p panel in the first place and the biggest limiting factor for me with a 4k display is the refresh rate at 60 Hertz it is a bit limiting especially coming from a high refresh rate screen but the colors on this the contrast ratio on this is really really nice better than the IPS screen of course but I think it's safer to go with this display because I don't have to worry about potential burning issues on the 4k options so let's wait and see how OLED matures over time potentially we could get lower resolution high refresh rate OLED panels with better durability over time - so let me know what you guys think about the Aero 15 from gigabyte specifically the OLED models would you consider one right now and let me know your thoughts about bokura and performance were you surprised by that love tune your thoughts I'm Ebro with Haruka knacks thank you so much for watching make

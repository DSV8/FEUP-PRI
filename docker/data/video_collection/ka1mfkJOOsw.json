    "transcript": "what's up guys I'm Dmitry with Hardware Canucks and today i'll talk about Intel Optane memory in what situations it should be used and in what situations until my face challenges so in though often memory aims to accelerate performance of your system by Ram caching bits and pieces of a most frequently used program so things loads faster now it's not a new concept by any means of imagination but it is a new hardware implementation that is fast it's affordable and it's adaptable so let's talk about all that right after this you can only rely on the pros to do the job with every keystroke satisfying like the millions before it call it close every key regardless of your state kula master master keys bro take it with you make it yours and so this is what the Intel optane memory module looks like it's using a standard ender to interface that is available in 16 and 32 gigabyte capacities inside of which is intel's new 3d xpoint memory it is only single sided so as you can see only the memory is on this side nothing here so until often is supposed to actively learn your usage habits and accelerate the load times of programs that you use the most it uses algorithms that are very similar it's not identical to intel's older SSD caching technologies and it's still not much has changed you cannot select which programs are accelerated nor does it have any more features than ssd caching you'll pay forty-four and seventy seven dollars for those capacities and we find that the 32 gigabyte module to be in a challenging spot as its competing with similarly priced 120 gigabyte SSDs while the 16 gigabyte opting module sends free of competition and just because your motherboard might have and ends up two slots it does not mean that it will support obtain memory because you require a z270 motherboard and a 7th generation Intel CPU for optane memory to work because the microcode is compatible only with that hardware specification another most notable limitation Intel optane memory is it will only accelerate your primary boot drive so where your OS is installed if you have secondary drives in your system when it has your game library or other applications it will not accelerate your secondary storage so primary only which I would see is limitation enthusiasts like to spread their stuff through separate drives but this really comes off can reveal the question of the target audience for not really the mainstream audience but system integrators and the notebook space will definitely you know benefit from Intel optane and I say this because Intel often aims to address the slow performance of spinning hard drives without that chunky price premium well hello people this is the sleeper PC that Intel sent us with the Intel optane module a very unique I might say you know quite old Wow look at that paint job mmm so anyway this beeper PC here well that sound Linus would be proud but anyway so if respects here we have an ace USB 250 motherboard we have 16 gigabytes of RAM wasn't there's the 1 terabyte hard drive and then Intel optane module which is 32 gigabytes we have 550 watt power supply very basic system so it's booted up see how fast this thing boots with optane on and off and launched some games to see if we can feel in your real world acceleration three two one go alright so the first test is the Windows boot test and I decided to leave this one running in real time as I thankfully forgotten how long a system boots off a hard drive since moving to an SSD only workstation machine but was often enabled this is after like a fourth boot here we're actually pretty speedy at 21 seconds for the desktop to appear while with optane off it's a bit slower to get into Windows but only about 10 seconds slower and now for some gaining test now we launch the game and load the save games twice so things in cash into optane so opening your hammer is much faster with optane it's very close to a savvy performance while loading a game save is a little bit slower versus a hard drive only but significantly slower versus how fast the game loads from an SSD launching virus that one shows similar results with optane matching the speed of an SSD while loading a game save gives us only marginally faster load versus the hard drive only but an SSD is still far superior and this leads me to believe that optane is only caching some information one is trying to load save games versus caching a lot more into optane when loading the game engine itself and you can see that by the significant in acceleration when trying to launch the game is much greater with optane on vs. what we see in the acceleration when trying to load game saves and then opening Adobe Photoshop CC with almost all toolbars enabled there is a significant speed increase to load this program with optane enabled almost just as fast as an SSD so that was all fine and dandy and you can definitely see the performance improvement with the spinning hard drive and until optane but we have some concerns primarily there's no way to know of how much memory has been already occupied by the caching of your most frequent programs so therefore you cannot you know how do you choose between 16 of the 32 gigabyte models there's no bar graph to see how much you filled up and I would say for the consumers that's fine because it's a simple plug-and-play solution but it's also is a sort of a compromise for the enthusiast market who potentially want to tinker with exactly what applications you want to accelerate but none of that is available so it's a simple all-or-nothing approach which is a negative and a positive and the next big concern for us would be price at $77 for the 32gb memory module you can pick up just for $13 more a 275 gigabyte SSD that is both faster and just you know has so much more capacity that you can use for your OS drive or your gaming drive so you know alongside the hard drive so it really kind of makes a difficult choice on whether you should purchase the Intel optane module to accelerate your hard drive when you can just buy an SSD and lastly it's simply not wise to pair an Intel optane module with an SSD because value is simply not there so guys thank you so much for watching it's been an interesting experience you know learning on what this thing does and really the main downfall would be that lack of software customization on what software and applications until often accelerates at least for me that is but what do you guys think of Intel opting let me know in the comments down below I'm Dmitry with Hardware Canucks Eber so yeah thanks so much for watching we'll see you in the next video",

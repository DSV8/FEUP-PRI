    "transcript": "This here is another viewer's broken gaming PC wait why is the audio out of sync.. Linus is cooler... I quit and work for Linus now, maybe Kyle, no Lyle... Greg your channel is bad like Kyle. Lyle better. Hi my name is Greg, i'm filming from my desk because i had some audio issues at the beginning of this video and of course i didn't realize that until i started editing so you're gonna see some voiceover uh action we're gonna hear some voice over action at the beginning of this one the good thing is once i start troubleshooting you won't have to deal with this anymore if you're seeing a shot of my lips moving and i have to voice over it i'm just gonna grayscale that clip and i'll try to put as much b-roll over it as possible so that it doesn't annoy you it's already annoying me so i know it's going to annoy some of you and i apologize for that i've already ordered new audio equipment so that this does not happen again so just the beginning of the video i have to do this and then i think one other section of the video a bit later but the rest of it is good so yeah sorry again so this build is uh well it's huge first off there's a lot of cable clutter it's kind of an older system z270 i believe it didn't actually realize at the time i knew it was an intel platform i just didn't know how old it was and the graphics card is a gtx 970. now according to the viewer this system flat out refuses to post which i assume means that it does receive power and does quote unquote turn on but we don't get a picture out so we're gonna try to work our magic in this one i already know of course how this turns out because i'm filming this after the fact but i really think you're gonna enjoy it and i think that you're gonna be wanting to hit me over the head with something once you realize what actually was wrong with the build stay with me if you're anything like me you probably wake up in the morning and jump onto social media aimlessly browsing for the latest industry headlines but what if i told you there was a better way incoming morning brew it's a free daily newsletter designed to be witty relevant and informative i've been staying on top of the topsy-turvy stock market thanks to morning bruce palatable briefings and when something spikes or dips in after hours of overnight trading morning brew lets me know they make it so easy to navigate various stories on mobile simply wake up check your inbox and you'll find a daily morning brew newsletter packed with the latest hardware surveys whistleblower testimonies and more so if you're interested in business finance or tech or maybe even all three be sure to subscribe to morningbrew it takes literally seconds and is totally free just click the sponsor link below to get started today now in this clip here all i'm doing is discussing the methodology behind choosing the systems that i choose for this playlist to fix i get a lot of inquiries in the orlando florida area but many of them have to do with software issues and i'm just not very comfortable troubleshooting software not only can it take several days to diagnose but i'm not super familiar with it either the hardware stuff is generally easier to troubleshoot i think anyone in it for the most part would agree with me on that and especially when we're talking about larger components swapping things out takes seconds anyone could do this you don't even need a high school diploma so the first part again of every troubleshooting process should be to plug in the system and attempt to replicate the issue described by the owner and in this case if you recall the system apparently turns on but does not post so we're going to connect it here i'm going to click the power button and see what happens and you can see we do have power the LEDs in the fan for the cpu cooler are on but we're not getting a post nothing just a black screen okay i'm finished voicing over for now i do apologize again i know this is super annoying there is one other section where i do have to do this but the meat and potatoes of the video is good to go let's get into it so i spent the last few minutes checking both dvi and DisplayPort connections directly from the motherboard still not getting a picture out this could be though because the cpu doesn't have an integrated graphics processor we're going to check that now this is a let's see here i7 7700 k so that that's not a they didn't have kf's back then i don't think so yeah this should have an integrated graphics processor or an igp if you want to use the abbreviated version of that it means that there is a way for this cpu to output video right directly from itself it doesn't need a discrete card to output that video so we should be getting a picture and we're not getting a picture from either this or the discrete card so i'm actually inclined to think that his 970s okay which i suppose is a really good thing in this market you know this is one of the more expensive components in this build given current conditions how expensive graphics cards can be i'm still gonna swap this out though just to be sure and i'm also gonna try booting into the igp without a discreet card in here maybe the motherboard's just defaulting to trying to send video out through this card because it detects that a card is here so we'll remove this as well i'll take care of this stuff off camera very quickly and more bad news neither of the things i just tried worked we get no picture out from the cpu or the igp and the cp when plugging directly into the motherboard with no discrete card in here and when i do connect the discreet card that i know works like this GT710 my trustfuel 710 i've used in several fixer flop videos by this point we still get no picture from a card that we know works so something very very sneaky is happening with this rig i'm starting to suspect the motherboard over anything else it could also be the cpu because the cpu is bad it doesn't matter what card you have in your system you're not going to get picture out right your cpu is one of your first lines of defense so uh yeah motherboard or cpu and the problem is this is an older platform i don't readily have like motherboards that i can swap this one out this is a z270 motherboard that's a couple generations old by this point so i'll have to order one i don't really have another choice let's see what else we can do though i might have a few other things to try so in my closet here i mean i have a few motherboards i know this is probably more than most of you have that's just because this is what i do for a living but the closest board i have to being compatible with a 7700k is a z370 and actually the board that's in there is not even a z370 motherboard it's like a much older board so uh yeah i don't have anything to test that 7700k with what i suppose i can do however is swap out both the motherboard and the cpu with a setup that i know works and we just go from there i'm sure it'll fix the issue but that won't really tell us which one specifically is wrong either the motherboard or the cpu so now i have disconnected every non-vital connection that excludes only the 24 pin and the 8 pin eps and what that does essentially is roll out any user error any short anywhere else on the motherboard although again this doesn't look like a short this is how shorts typically look i do want to mention that up front but this will help us narrow down the motherboard if it is the motherboard or the cpu that's connected to the motherboard i don't think this is ram we could try receding around but uh actually we should probably well we'll do that in a second resetting ram is probably one of the easier things to do so we should try that uh sooner rather than later but i do want to let's see we'll power it on let's see if we get a post did i oh i forgot i need to jump i always forget to do this i need to jump the pins because i disconnected them all right there we go power supply is spinning and we're just waiting now for a post if one ever shows up although i doubt it a few moments later and that's enough waiting still no joy i am going to swap ram with a stick that i know works we're just going to stick with one dimm in the first slot that needs to be populated that's right here next to the slots on the board itself and uh we'll try booting up this way before we swap the platform i'm crossing everything i got in hopes that this works because if it doesn't it's gonna be a pretty beefy upgrade i keep forgetting i need to jump the dang board there we go let's see now we've officially rolled out everything except for the motherboard cpu and power supply although power supply seems fine to me yeah still still not seeing a post gg by the way i did do the very quick things that you should do in the beginning i cleared the cmos and well i should have swapped ram earlier than this but doesn't seem to be fixing the issue anyway i feel like i got bit by something on my elbow and still nothing with the graphics card in the lower full length pcie slot i'm really trying to give this platform the benefit of the dial but like i said earlier if we're not getting picture out even from the 7700k itself that tells me that it's again either the motherboard of the cpu so i guess at this point i have really nothing left to try let's get this thing out of here hi there greg from the future again just one more time in this clip here i talk about how i noticed that there was an led debug indicator on the right side of the z270 board and i noticed that when i powered the system on the top two leds would flicker for a split second the cpu and the drm i believe and then they would cut right back off you can see the b-roll here this is what was happening it happened so quickly that i didn't notice it even turning on before which is why i didn't even know it existed because the lights were were on for fractions of a second but this prompted me to swap power supplies just to be on the safe side because i wasn't really sure why we were getting that odd flicker this could be a short but it ended up not being one and i'm kind of glad because at this point i was already so deep into replacing the platform that i had already kind of committed to removing things so what i ended up doing was upgrading his entire platform with uh yeah with stuff that's much newer so he has a 9900 ks in this build now and a z i think it's a z390 motherboard i don't really remember it's a gigabyte designer board so a very beautiful motherboard beautiful platform he's got a 9900 ks in there now which is like double the course to double the threads um he's he's set he's good to go i did reuse his ram but that's you know ddr4 to ddr4 no problem there but yeah this platform is much newer and i think he's going to be happy with this at the end of the day like i said i knew that it was either the motherboard of the cpu so replacing both was just this safe play while i was in the process of ordering other components because i didn't have any to test with so that's what you'll hear me talk about here in a second but yeah so this platform is new for him and we turn it on make sure that it works he's good to go so i think at this point i'm gonna let him keep these upgrades and these are definitely upgrades over his previous intel rig so from a 7700k to a 9900 ks and he's still going to get overclocking support with a beefier more modern z series motherboard we'll keep his ram in there actually we can recycle the cpu cooler since it's the same socket layout and everything else will be the same we just need to tackle this um yeah obvious rat's nest down here now after powering the system on making sure that his fans were spinning making sure the rgb was on it's not synced up yet because well he needs to download software to do that i noticed that neither of the drives in his build have boot volumes on them they're both samsung ssds one of them is larger than the other but neither has any created volume at all in fact these look almost brand new if you look in the i have windows media creation tool pulled up here just to confirm that no volumes exist and sure enough both drive 0 and drive 1 have 100 unallocated space so like i said if you bought one of these from best buy this is what you would see well both of these are like that so i'm going to ask the viewer what he wants me to do which drive he wants me to install windows on assuming he wants windows and then we can push this bill to the side because otherwise it's working again mission accomplished we still have an elephant in the room though and that's the platform that we previously removed the z270 board and the 7700k which of those is bad i don't have other components from that generation to swap with right now so we're gonna have to go um fishing so it has been a few days since filming that last clip you just saw and i wanted to take some time to gather not only a z270 motherboard that had both native skylake and cable like support but also i wanted to have a kaby lake cpu or just even a skylake cpu something i could use to run with that z270 board to swap out with his as well now i've already returned his system so you're gonna see it at the end of the video when i do the outro and stuff i'll be wearing my old shirt but i'm filming this scene much later because again i had to wait for that hardware to show up his system is good to go and that's why i already returned it because it had those upgrades that i just showed you but at this point i still want to narrow down whether it's the motherboard from his old system at fault or its cpu this here is the motherboard and cpu from the broken system the one that we started the video off with you can see this is the core i7 7700k i've got a core i5 6500 i bought from a gentleman named ahri i appreciate you ari and the maximus 9 hero here the z270 motherboard i bought from shannon i appreciate you shannon you know who you are this is a pretty beast board here and he didn't even want me to pay for it i just covered shipping for him so uh big thanks to him we've got two components here that we do still need to test so we want to make sure especially in shipping with this motherboard that everything works once we confirm that both the cpu and the motherboard work in here then we want to take this cpu and put it into this viewer's motherboard if we don't get a post that means it's the motherboard to blame and if we do get a post then it's probably the cpu to blame and we'll take the 7700k we'll throw that into this motherboard to confirm that finding if that is how it plays out so just to give you a rundown that's what i'm about to do here we go you can plug hdmi directly into the motherboard because these cpus have integrated graphics everything else is wired up and uh yeah let's give it a go so this here is with the uh the two that i just bought i'm just confirming that these work before we start swapping other components around i have no fan just because the system's not going to be on that long using yeah we got a doctor debug up here so i can see what it's doing yep there we go bootlight all right so these uh these two components work that's great i had no doubt these these two people were really cool and i appreciate their help in this video and now for the tricky part so we're gonna put his 7700k into this rig now that we've confirmed that this motherboard is functional we're going to see if we get a picture out now 7700k it's a kb lake cpu but it should still have an igp and that's why we don't need to discrete graphics card in case you're wondering slide this one on in nice and carefully and lock the retention arm again are we gonna get a post that is the ultimate question now if i had to wager if i was a betting man i'd say the cpu is perfectly fine wow wow we've got a doctor debug 0 or oa that is not good so if i had been a betting man i'd have lost a lot of money this doctor debug indicator right here is indicating that the cpu is fried and it doesn't matter which slot i use for this single dim it could be channel a channel b slot 1 or slot 2 for either channel the system still will not post i think we've just got a totally bricked cpu and by process of elimination that means that this viewer's motherboard assuming the platform itself wasn't totally toast should be fully functional that's what we've got installed now we're going to power it back on this board we do have to manually jump let's see here motherboard does the exact same thing on the debug led wow you know what maybe the motherboard is what killed the cpu maybe i just killed my 6500 by putting it in this motherboard oh no no it's booted what okay we've got the i don't know something might be wrong with the debug led thing i'll show you guys right here what it does it kind of flickers for a second and then cuts back out well that's what it was doing with the 7700k as well except from this point on it just stayed off but uh here it boots up the boot led lights up and we have a post it's just the cpu a dead 7700k that was giving this viewer such a headache a few moments later okay and another turn of events did nothing to check this i always check it with ryzen cpus but i didn't think to check it with an intel c because it doesn't usually happen this cpu was purchased second hand actually the viewer knew who he purchased this i think was a family member i believe it was working so it's kind of weird that it would die right in transport it's very easy to ship these i i didn't check the contact points on the back of the chip so i'm going to get out of the shot here so it doesn't focus on my face and i'm going to show you what it looks like right so that's the backside of the 7700k now if you notice down here at the bottom we've got a weird little spot i believe this was preventing proper contact between this contact pad and the pins in the socket so if i'm correct if we clean this it should work because again it's very rare the cpus just die um i and i stand by that i'm going to clean this thing up we're going to put it back in that board for one final hoorah let's see if all of this was for nothing i mean at the end of the day at least the viewer got a really nice platform upgrade right 9900 ks and a z was a z390 motherboard and that's that's a really good upgrade so i don't regret the upgrade itself i just wish i had noticed this a bit sooner because i feel kind of stupid now just going to use a q-tip and some ipa same stuff i use in the pcdc series and they can see we've already got a pretty big smudge picked up on the q-tip there um i i am i'm pretty confident this is going to fix the cpu i can't believe i didn't check this sooner oh my gosh i feel so stupid i always do this with verizon and i just figure i don't know i checked the socket here i did not check the back of the seat who who the heck has a smudge like that on the back of their cpu i don't know it's no excuse i should have caught it earlier right so this looks so much better back in goes his 7700k what do we have power on at the rear and jump the pins here oh i'm gonna be i'm gonna be so thrilled if this works come on give me something oh it is it's working yeah yes i'm such an idiot but i'm so happy it worked it worked wow we've got a vga light i'm not sure what that's for we didn't get that with the 6500 in here but uh oh no it's on boot now okay cool so that wow that is really something it literally just came down to the smudge on the back of his cpu another one for the books and another one that i will never ever again forget to check even if it's an intel cpu folks and you're having issues you've narrowed it down to the cpu itself before you throw it in the trash maybe check the contact points on the back of it if it's an intel chip if it is a ryzen cp obviously check the pins make sure there are none that are bent or straight up missing and always check the sockets of both platforms as well there could be something lodged in either of those could be missing pins on the lga side of things but yeah this this wow i i'm super happy um that is that means i can keep the 7700k i mean i gave him a 9900ks and i bought a 6500 because well i figured why not i want to test but really a 7700k was fine so now i have three skylake or kaby lake cpus laying around i didn't really need that many but i suppose i kind of brought that on myself this this was all over the place i still can't believe it just came down to a simple smudge so we fixed his issue granted it took me again a lot longer than it probably should have we confirmed that his motherboard is just fine we also confirmed that his cpu is just fine so thanks for watching this far into the video i do hope at the very least you were entertained by this one but maybe you also learned a thing or two and that's a win-win because i'm learning as i go as well i don't claim to know everything about pcs especially on the software side but even hardware though i've been working with it for for several years now which is kind of hard to believe that much time has gone by i'm not very old i'm only 26 about to turn 27. i i still run into new things almost every day especially in this playlist here so it kind of kicks me out of my comfort zone and forces me to experiment a bit troubleshoot and try new things learn sometimes fail sometimes succeed and all of that is documented on camera for all of you so maybe if you run into a similar situation as this one you'll be better prepared to diagnose it troubleshoot it nowhere to start with know how to narrow down that specific component that is giving you a massive headache with that if you guys enjoyed the video be sure to give it a thumbs up i would appreciate that or reach out if you live in the orlando florida area and you have an issue with your system more than likely hardware related i would be more than happy to help for free no charge at all and leave a comment down below let me know what you'd like to see next did i already say that i don't know if i said that yet if i did i'm gonna sound really stupid if i didn't there you go thanks for watching my name is greg thanks for learning with me",

    "transcript": "*whoops* I bought another dodgy PC off of eBay. But first! What's this? A Dawid does Techstuff Minecraft Server powered by our friends at Linode? Which we all know is the best Linux based cloud computing and web hosting service and aside from providing amazing Minecraft servers Linode offers a whole host of linux-y services services Linode balancers cloud computing database management and even kubernetes just to name a few if this sounds good to you sign up to the node using the link in the description below for a 60-day hundred dollar credit thank you to Linode for sponsoring today's video [Music] thank you now in all fairness this system is a lot less dodgy than the previous broken Alienware I bought off of eBay but again the guy who promised to sell me random royal family member pubes in an alley behind a Denny's was a bit less dodgy than that PC anyway so this is an NZXT build pre-build that's been refurbished by some Rando on eBay so let's have a look at what kind of work Randy did for us today [Music] now at this point I still have no idea whether this isn't just a case in a box so uh yeah hopefully Randy didn't screw us oh um that's not a great sign nice there's clearly stuff in this system so that's good [Music] okay and on First Impressions it looks a little bit scruffy although the side panel has been left unpeeled so the previous owner was clearly a weirder or Randy re-peeled it but is that a thing you can do I don't know now because it's an NZXT pre-built it comes in this lovely NZXT h510 flow case we've got a ventilated panel on the front which makes it a rarified breed compared to the standard pre-built auto erotic asphyxiation cases there's some front i o a tempered glass side panel that we're even gonna get to peel very exciting as you can see inside there's also some of the foamy stuff which makes for safe shipping so that's good to see inside and then on the back we've got not the best rear i o but it's usable we've got enough USB ports and Wi-Fi and stuff under that the graphics card has support next to which there looks to be impact damage which kind of makes it look like the system was dropped on its booty at some point maybe that's why Randy had to get involved the power supply does look interesting is that like a bracket that is holding an sff power supply into place we're gonna have to investigate that a bit later and then finally according to this sticker the system was manufactured and by that I'm assuming they mean assembled halfway through last year so it's a pretty young system anyway let's open it up and have a look inside oh there is a lot of plastic stuffed in the front there really stuck well that felt destructive now the first thing I noticed about the inside is that the graphics card's power isn't plugged in but that's probably because they couldn't get it in with the foam I'm guessing but wait a minute that's an RTX 3060 TI I'm pretty sure I didn't pay for one of those or did I let me go check the listing quickly it turns out I didn't I paid 580 for a system that was meant to have a GTX 1050 TI in it and I got an RTX 3060 TI instead I guess we're gonna have to find out what CPU we got a bit later but it seems like Randy made a bit of a whoopsie now I did message Randy telling them about the mix-up but Randy hasn't responded to me yet so we're gonna have to wait till the end of the video to see if Randy eventually gets back to me now aside from our Lottery Win of a graphics card we also have some dual Channel Ram in here very nice and next to that we've even got a CPU Cooler that you wouldn't be embarrassed to whip out at a public shower although it is curved a bit funny there's also a one terabyte SSD in there all in all aside from a bit of skewness it's a decent looking system but it's hard to complain about something so much better endowed than you paid for but anyway I am very curious what all of this is I'm assuming that the you know GPU power is part of it but let's have a look oh it's just like the standard PC accessory crap cool now before I plug the graphics card back in I do want to see what power supply we got with this bad boy [Music] oh the rear Cable Management does look pretty nice we've got some stuff routed in places very good and considering that this is an NZXT h510 we've also got nice features and stuff on the back other power supply is in fact a small form factor power supply you can see it's all little and cute in there and it is an s650 which from the sticker on the top is a 80 plus gold rated power supply now I think it's a bit weird that there's a small form factor power supply in this not a small form factor PC but I'm not going to discriminate because of its size I'm sure it'll get the job done [Music] so let's turn it on and see what the windows situation is like your account has been disabled please see your system administrator okay bit of a weird start but restarting the system got me access to Windows oh I was then greeted with a system preparation tool prompt which I easily handled with my massive expertise and I just tell it to go away we are in and it just seems like it's a blank Windows install which is nice in terms of VD there's it's just windows so that that's good that's that's nice we don't even have a funky background hey cpu-wise we got an 11 400f which is a massive upgrade over the pathetic 9100f we paid for yeah Randy did kind of screw this up didn't he oh no Randy or Ram hasn't been sent to its native 3200 megahertz speed and considering that the 11400f I don't think is the greatest pairing with the 3060 TI at 1080P and that paired with slow Ram speeds means we may be seeing some bottle making action while gaming on that let's try and do some gaming on our incorrect little system we have everything cracked at 1080p on GTA 5 and we're getting solidly over 120 frames per second which you'd kind of expect although if you look at the oopsie if you look at the GPU utilization there's not a whole lot going on oh that was quite the car accident so later in the video I will set the Ram at its rated speed and see how much that helps the performance and I I think it should make a reasonable difference considering the GPU but other than that other than like the actual utilization it's running pretty well like it's the frame rate stable the temperatures are very good with that ventilated front panel and obviously the fact that it's 16 degrees Celsius in here helps but yeah that's it's running well [Music] I've spent enough time playing Battlefield 5 for the system to get nice and toasty and at 1080p High settings the GPU is giving us pretty high utilization so I don't think the CPU is holding us back too much but again we'll test the ram configuration and so on later on uh the temperatures are very good the system is a little noisy but because we've got so much temperature Headroom we could play around with the fan speeds and stuff too to quieten down to quiet it down a little bit generally the performance is insane I mean it has a 3060 TI in it so of course it's gonna it's gonna slay here ha ha ha many people cyberpunk is cooking with gas 1080p high and we're almost getting a hundred frames per second without dlss or other things of that nature yeah I mean it just runs well like I don't really know what else of interest to say here so with that let's set the ram to its rated frequency and see how much more performance we get [Music] foreign [Music] the frame rate seems maybe a little bit better but it could be map related uh either way with the ram change we are still seeing situations where the GPU isn't fully being utilized but either way temperature wise we haven't gained any real significant temperature uh despite the fact that we seem to be getting more performance out of the system so that's good but anyway with that let's have a look at the benchmarks and see what they say [Music] yeah that made a bit of a difference but not nearly as big a difference as going from the 1050 TI we were meant to get to an RTX 3060 TI and just to be sure about that I dropped the 1050 TI into this system and with cyberpunk running at the same settings as before I think it may be running a bit worse and this was with a much less geriatric CPU than we were meant to get actually on the note of Randy it's been a couple of days since I messaged them about their little whoopsie and I still haven't heard back from Randy I'll update you with a comment down below if I hear anything back and with that I guess my takeaway from today's video is if you buy enough crap on the internet eventually you'll lock out and buy something actually better than you were expecting anyway thank you for watching if you enjoyed the video consider subscribing or watching another one a suggestion will pop up in a second and until the next video bye-bye [Music] foreign [Music]",

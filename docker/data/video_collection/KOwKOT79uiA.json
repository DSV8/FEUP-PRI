    "transcript": "What's up guys, Lew here back with another video. And today- This might be The most exciting thing I've brought you in a while This right here is a little appliance that is gonna chill any beverage, carbonated or otherwise in one minute. Chill a beverage in one minute I know you've been in that situation before where you just needed a cold beverage, and you didn't have time to put in the fridge and sit around and wait. This might be the solution to all your problems. It is the \"Cooper Cooler Rapid Beverage Chiller\". You can chill wine, you can chill beer, you can chill soda, you can chill Coca Cola You can chill- an Olde English, while you're at it. My understanding is- It's something to do with the circulation of super cold water. I gotta get this baby out. Not- I mean, I'm normally pumped but I'm even more pumped. Power adapter. You know I like to bring you guys the gadgets that are hard to find and you might not know about. Think about it, you don't have room in the fridge for everything Somebody wants something exotic? No problemo. We've got the Super Chiller. It's got a little dial on the front, you can select what type of beverage you're working with. I'm not even sure where the... Oh... What if I've got a can? Same idea. Where is English? I'm in Franais right now Ah a ta ta ta- So you fill this baby up right here at two trays of ice and two cups of water. Oh, and if you have a bigger bottle, like a wine bottle, this piece comes out or a Perrier bottle. And now, look at that. It can close down. The can cycle is one minute! One minute long! That's insane. I have warm- this is warm warm Coke. Time to add the water. Essentially what you're doing here is giving you drink a quick bath, in ice bath. A cryogenic bath. We need ice now. If you have trays of ice, then what you are looking for is two trays; I've got a bag of ice, so I'm just gonna estimate Look at this, uhh... beautiful ice water. I place the can in, on the sidewall here. Close it down. On the front there is a button here that says \"can\" or \"baby bottle\". We're gonna go \"can\". And then start. *Rumbling noise* Uhh... OHH.... Rapid spinning going on, right now. And an icy cold bath. Now apparently this only last sixty seconds. And we end up with a refrigerator temperature Coca Cola. *Rumbling noise stops* Was that sixty seconds? WHOOO! *Can opening clicks* MMHHHH! MMHHHH! WOW! YEAH! Look, I mean, you can even see on the can; look at my fingerprint. I don't care what kind of contraption you have, If you dump this in a cooler with ice in it or if you put it in the fridge, or even in the freezer; it's not gonna be as fast as that. Ninety times faster than a refrigerator, forty times faster than a freezer. So, Coca Cola is one thing, but what if you're talking about Colt 45. Can I try extra? I wanna see if I can get it even colder. LOOK AT THAT! This is like a microwave it's like a microwave for cold. You can see Jack, look at it. Look where my hand is. Can you see that? That is ice cold. No crazy foaming. It's ice cold! I love it! I love it when a product comes across the desk here, at Unbox Therapy and it does what it claims to do. I don't care if you're into Australian beer, maybe you're looking at an energy drink, maybe it's a Rockstar, maybe you're a Mountain Dew kinda of dude; this is gonna chill it down in a minute. On demand, cold. Tell your friends.",

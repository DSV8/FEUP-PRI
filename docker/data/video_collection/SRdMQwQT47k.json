    "transcript": "- Pebble raised over $43 million on Kickstarter, smashing multiple records and propelling the world into the smartwatch revolution. But then they vanished. So what... or who killed them? Sponsored by Vessi. (upbeat music) Hey everyone, how are you all doing? If you're new here, welcome. My name is Krazy Ken and I never owned a Pebble back when it was new. I actually held out for the Apple Watch. But despite what watch you use, we all owe a great deal of gratitude to Pebble because without their innovations, products like the Apple Watch would probably be a year or maybe even a couple years behind. So let's take a look at Pebble's history and then we'll explore the products themselves, the hardware and the software. And then we'll see how and why this company went from hero to zero in only a matter of years. There's been several types of computer watches throughout history, like the WearComp Linux watch developed by Steve Mann in 1998. But the first big commercial success would be Pebble in 2013. And it all started with this man, Eric Migicovsky. Eric was a student at the University of Waterloo and he shared a watch concept that could display notifications from a smartphone. One of his earliest inspirations was a project request from his uncle in 2007. He asked Eric to hack a bedside clock so it could project BlackBerry emails on the ceiling. In 2008, Eric built a watch prototype using cell phone parts and an Arduino. And with some other students, Eric formed a new company named Allerta. Next year, they announced their first product, the Impulse smartwatch for BlackBerry devices. Oh yeah, BlackBerry, back when that was a thing. I mean, we can't really make fun of them, they had a good run. And the goal was simple, display notifications from your BlackBerry, Android or Symbian phone via Bluetooth. - That baby will do everything but tell you what time it is. - It doesn't tell time? - But Eric is an ambitious man, right? He had bigger fish to fry. He wanted to make a better version of Impulse that was compatible with iPhone because that was the number one request they received. Eric worked with designer Andrew Witte to make this all new watch. But like most things in life, you need money to make it happen. Eric pitched his new smartwatch to startup accelerator Y Combinator. And these guys mean business. You've likely used a product funded by YC before. Eric raised $375,000 through YC, but he needed more. So he sought out help from Kickstarter. Little did he know, he was about to make history. On April 11th, 2012, Allerta, now Pebble Technology, launched their campaign for the first Pebble smartwatch with a $100,000 goal. Okay, but I just gotta warn you, that's a big chunk of change. It may take you a while to hit it. Oh, okay, you raised the money in two hours. All right. The Kickstarter campaign ended on May 18th and raised almost $10.3 million freaking dollars from 68,929 backers. Whoa. Pledge to my Patreon- In the end, Pebble became one of the most funded Kickstarter campaigns in history. The Pebble started shipping to backers on January 23rd, 2013. And it had special Kickstarter edition text printed on the back. And the regular edition was released to the public in July for $149. Huh, January, July, that's a big time gap. So some things probably happened. Mass manufacturing and distribution is very challenging, especially for a beginning startup. And it looks like some Kickstarter backers were getting impatient. And it turns out, despite the backer shipping starting in January, some backers did not get their watch until July. I'd be upset too. Heck, I backed Animusic 3 when it launched on Kickstarter in 2012 and I still haven't received it. So here we are at the first generation Pebble and it's got some juicy hardware and software features. Heck, you guys must really love the Pebble. I received a lot of replies from people on Twitter saying how much they liked their products and some of them still use their watches today. Heck, my friend Brad was a loyal user since day one and he hiked with Pebble on the Appalachian Trail. He's a Garmin user today, but he loved the Pebble back when it was a thriving product. And I tapped into his brain a little bit to learn more about these things. Because again, I'm a total novice with these. I never owned one before. So let's take a look at the hardware and the software and see what's up. (upbeat music) The Pebble featured a scratch and shatter resistant anti-glare plastic enclosure with swappable rubber watch bands. It came in three colors, Arctic White, Jet Black, and Cherry Red. The fourth color, Orange, was voted by backers. Pebble is water resistant with a five atmosphere rating, allowing for 50 meters of depth. So you can swim, dive, or shower without taking it off. And no, before you ask, I'm not gonna shower with it on camera. Not again, but I'll gladly swim with it. You know, okay, I thought it over. If y'all behave, I'll shower with it and test it out at the end of the episode. If you're good, do we have a deal? Now, originally the first Pebble actually wasn't supposed to be water resistant. Eric and the team added in that feature later because, you know, they have $10 million sitting here. They thought they would do something with it. And they listened to their community. There were a lot of suggestions on the campaign saying, please make it water resistant. So they listened. The display was 1.26 inches big and it used an ultra low power e-paper LCD manufactured by Sharp. It featured 144 by 168 resolution and one bit black and white graphics. The display used a transflective layer. So your environment's light illuminated the display which helped save power. But when necessary, there was a built-in backlight too. And this helped achieve Pebble's legendary seven-day battery life. I've talked to several owners and it seems like the battery is the most praised feature. And to charge the battery, you connect Pebble to a special USB cable with a magnetic attachment. Now let's take a closer look at the internal specs. Pebble used an ARM Cortex M3 CPU with 128 kilobytes of RAM and four megabytes of flash storage. Pebble also had a vibrating motor for alerts, a three axis accelerometer, a magnetometer and ambient light sensor. So you have all of these juicy gizmos and gadgets strapped onto your wrist. What do you do with them? That's where the software comes in. Pebble collaborated with Apple to make a special version of macOS that was compatible with smartwatches. No, not really. Just making sure you're still paying attention. Pebble ran its own operating system, Pebble OS, which was built on a customized version of FreeRTOS. FreeRTOS is a common real-time operating system used in microcontrollers and small microprocessors. So it works perfectly for a tiny watch. Pebble OS lets users view iPhone and Android notifications on their wrist via Bluetooth. That was the big feature. But it also allows custom watch faces, which can be installed from the user's phone via the Pebble app. I love using the Sonic one because it helps me go fast. Oh, and we can't forget about the classic Macintosh desktop. And the Pebble could run apps. It had a built-in cycling application. It had a built-in range finder. And we take that stuff for granted nowadays. But back when this was new, the concept of applications on your wrist, the whole concept of a smartwatch was kind of just a vague idea in people's heads. - Like an iPhone that's... a square. - But what about third-party apps? Well, there was no app store yet, but you could still download third-party apps and watch faces from other sources. And Pebble provided developers with an SDK so they can make those cool things. On April 12th, 2013, three months after the Pebble started shipping to backers, Pebble launched the SDK to developers so they can make watch faces and apps. But there were some limitations. For example, third-party apps could not communicate with your phone. But on a May 16th update, Pebble SDK was renamed PebbleKit and support for two-way communication between Pebbles and phones was now supported with the AppMessage framework. While developers were working on all the cool watch faces and third-party apps, the Pebble team was working on a brand new 2.0 SDK. On February 3rd, 2014, Pebble launched this new SDK with APIs for Bluetooth messaging, background workers, accelerometer access, compass access, and JavaScript. And then one day later, boom, app store. Pebble launched a dedicated app store inside the Pebble app with over 1,000 applications and faces available on day one. Multiple partners like ESPN, Uber, Yelp, eBay, and GoPro joined forces with Pebble to get their apps on users' wrists. Okay, this is looking good. You have the SDK, you have the community, you have the partners, you have the centralized app store. Bam, now we're cooking. And if that wasn't enough, Pebble launched a new Pebble Steel. So if you wanted the Pebble experience with a more premium look and feel, this was for you. It was available in black matte and brushed stainless steel for $249. And it featured a Corning Gorilla Glass screen. By the end of 2014, Pebble sold nearly 1 million units. And according to May 2014 data, they garnered 35% of the market share. But now it's at 0%, rounding down a little bit. But how could that happen? How could that possibly happen? Well, hold on there, Eager McBeaver. I appreciate your curiosity. But there's a couple important topics we need to cover first. When you have a banger on your hands, or wrist, what's the next natural step you wanna take? You make a sequel, right? Boom, say hello to Pebble Time, the next Pebble smartwatch. And it has a color display. Fueled by the original Pebble's positive reactions, Eric returned to where it all started, Kickstarter. On February 24th, 2015, Pebble announced a new campaign with a half a million dollar goal, which it reached in 17 minutes. Holy dollar bucks, Batman! These guys are redefining what it means to run a Kickstarter campaign. They're turning it into a community and marketing super tool, not just a crowdfunding platform. Pebble Time's campaign ended on March 27th, smashing Kickstarter records. It raised nearly $20.4 million from 78,471 backers. Winning the title of most funded Kickstarter project for seven years straight, until Brandon Sanderson passed it in 2022. Wow, I'm constantly blown away by how strong the Pebble community is. I mean, to band together that many of you and raise that much money that quickly, holy f- French toast. But this is where things start to get a little competitive, because another big company was about to launch their own watch, Apple. Rewinding to September 9th, 2014, Apple unveiled the Apple Watch to the world for the first time to much excitement. And then they forced a U2 album onto every customer's iTunes library and that pissed people off. Fine, be mad, I love U2 and Bono's luscious pipes. So I got no problems with that. Apple Watch was scheduled to launch on April 24th, 2015 and I actually ordered one right away. I didn't want them to sell out before I can get my hands on one. Now this Apple Watch launch date was one month after the Pebble Time campaign ended, so the clock was ticking. On May 27th, one month after the Apple Watch launch, Pebble Time released to backers and it sold publicly at US Best Buys and Targets for $199, starting on July 20th, according to Engadget. Pebble Time was slightly thinner and smaller than the original. And the case was curved so it could fit your wrist more ergonomically. The biggest difference you'll notice is the display, now capable of 64 colors. And it featured Corning Gorilla Glass. And time included a microphone for voice dictation. Pebble OS also received a big update with the new timeline feature, which lets users view past and future reminders, alarms, calendar events, weather, and more. In a December 15th software update, Pebble Time also featured Pebble Health for built-in activity tracking. So originally, Pebble didn't have any fitness tracking built in, but you could use third-party apps like Misfit, that was a big one. But now with Pebble Health, all that stuff was built into the watch. And boom, 1,211 steps. Oh wait, that's the time. - [Jogger] You're such an idiot. - Well, yeah, well, you're a biped! And with all those features put together, plus some other ones I didn't take the time to mention, Pebble Time still achieved that legendary seven-day battery life and water resistance. And to charge the battery, instead of attaching magnetically to the side, you now attach magnetically to the back. And if you craved that sexy steel, you can have it. Pebble Time Steel launched on August 6th, 2015 for $249. But we're not finished yet. Meet Pebble Time Round. It's round. Time Round had the same features as Time, but with a two-day battery life instead of seven, but smaller design means smaller battery. Fair trade-off. Time Round used a round display, shocker, and a super small, thin, and light stainless steel body, achieving more of that classic timepiece look. Round was released to retailers on November 8th, 2015 for $249. So now Pebble had multiple products to choose from and multiple bands and all this great stuff, but I'm a little concerned they're spreading themselves a bit too thin here. They're getting a little bit broad. And I don't know if that's the best thing to do when the competition is heating up. Apple Watch is selling. Android Wear is on the rise. The Moto 360 came out actually before the Apple Watch, and that had a round display. So things might start getting a little challenging. 2016 started rough. The market was getting crowded, and Pebble sales were dipping, and investment cash was tight. Unfortunately, because of all this, Eric cut 25% of Pebble's workforce, but he wasn't giving up yet. It was time for Pebble 2, a souped-up version of the original Pebble, aka Pebble Classic. It now featured a microphone, built-in sleep and activity tracking, and a heart rate monitor, but still a black and white display, which I still don't fully understand because the original Impulse had a color display. There's clearly some trade-off I'm not understanding here, but I digress. And Pebble Time 2, an upgraded Pebble Time with a larger 1.5-inch color display with a 228 by 200 resolution and a heart rate monitor. And then there was this. That's... different. Okay, so this is called Pebble Core. All right. Core was designed for runners, so you can track activity and stream Spotify music with a 3G cellular network, and it was compatible with a variety of fitness apps. And it was scheduled for a January 2017 launch for $99. Again, Eric turned to Kickstarter, and he set a $1 million goal for all these new products, and he completely smashed that goal. Even in the face of adversity and a crowded market, the community still really cared about Pebble, because this new campaign raised $12.8 million from about 66,000 people. And on September 30th, a month after the campaign ended, Pebble 2 started shipping to backers. So logically, what's next? Time 2 and Core, right? I mean, you announced them, so you're going to ship them, right? Right? Unfortunately, no. Pebble Time 2 and Pebble Core were canceled. They never sold. They never even shipped to backers who already paid money. So what the heck happened? Sadly, Pebble was winding down. There were reports that Pebble was about to be bought out by Fitbit. Okay, I mean, that could be good, right? Fitbit makes wearables, so this could be a good marriage. According to the information, Fitbit was in the process of acquiring Pebble for $34 to $40 million. At this time, Pebble's debt was around $25 million. This isn't the first time companies wanted to buy Pebble. In the past, Intel and Citizen talked with Pebble about a buyout, but Pebble declined. However, right now, they probably don't have a choice. On December 7th, 2016, Pebble published a Kickstarter update announcing they were officially acquired by Fitbit. The update says Fitbit would acquire key Pebble assets and that Pebble, as a company, would shut down. Pebble ceased all hardware operations, but active Pebble models in the wild would still continue to work. And that was mostly true. We'll get back to that in a sec. The update also says Kickstarter will refund eligible pledges by March 2017. Unfortunately, it appears many backers didn't receive refunds, at least judging from these comments on the update page. There's also backers commenting on the campaign page saying they still haven't received the refunds. And these comments are from the last several years, way after the refund date in 2017. Yeah, it seems like Pebble really bit off more than they could chew with this Kickstarter. But at least they were able to sell for enough money to get out of debt. So with the company shutting down, what happens with the Pebble hardware? Pebbles still function normally because Fitbit maintained the app store and other online services, at least until June 30th, 2018. But once again, the day is saved thanks to community-driven tech projects. Say hello to the Rebble Alliance. Rebble maintains web services in the absence of Pebble, and this includes the app store, which is good because now I can install this handy focus app so I can concentrate. Dog! All you need is the official Pebble app and a special connection that allows the app to talk to Rebble. Unfortunately, the official app is not in the iOS App Store or in the Google Play Store anymore. So you have to install it a different way, but the Rebble website has detailed guides on how to do everything. I decided to install it on Android because all you have to do is download the APK file and Bob's your uncle. On iOS, you have to sideload it and have fun with that. So yeah, we're just doing it on Android. And fun fact, this is actually my knockoff iPhone 12 that I did an episode about quite a while ago. We're actually using it for something productive today. Hooray! Once I downloaded the APK file and connected it to Rebble, I could add watch faces and apps, no problem. You know, I find it kind of amusing how Fitbit, a company worth $2.1 billion in 2021, was not willing or able to keep these services online for customers. But people on the internet forming a practically free organization were able to do it? Really makes you think. So whatever happened with Eric? I liked the guy. Well, worry not. He went on to co-found Beeper in 2020, which is a chat app that gathers your messages across multiple platforms and puts them in a unified inbox. And Eric is now a partner at a startup accelerator. And guess which one it is? You're right. It's YC. Life is a circle. So now, the big question. Why did Pebble fail? Well, if you ask me, they didn't really fail, at least not completely. Let's call it a successful failure. They were still bought for tens of millions of dollars. And if you're worth that much, you obviously did something right. So I think the better question to ask is what, or who, killed Pebble? And there's two sources that could answer this question. And I'll start with my personal opinion. What, I'm allowed to have those, right? Nothing personal, Pebble, but Apple Watch mopped the floor with you. They sold 10 million units in about eight months. And Pebble sold only about 2 million in its whole lifetime, which, don't get me wrong, is still a massive accomplishment. But for the broad market Pebble was targeting, 2 million is not enough. And I can't speak for everyone, but for me, the Apple Watch was more appealing because of its appearance, its feng shui, the haptic feedback, the display quality. Pebble never used more than a 64-color display. And the backlight kinda washed out the colors even further. But the Apple Watch displays always looked more beautiful, in my opinion. But at Pebble's inception, that other stuff didn't really matter. But with Pebble's success, the industry listened and they listened fast. And then Pebble ended up drowning in their own category that they created. Now, how about some answers from another source? And I think the source is pretty good because it's freaking Eric himself. He actually says Pebble did fail. Oh, come on, Eric, don't be so hard on yourself. He wrote about the successes and the failures on a medium.com article. And I read every single word. I'll link the whole thing down below in the description. But here's the rundown. There's three big reasons Pebble failed. One, Pebble time sales fell short. The company projected $100 million, and they did only 82. Now they were stuck with tons of inventory. Reason two, operating expenses were too high. In 2015, Eric and the Pebble team anticipated more growth. They hired more employees, they moved to a new office. They tried cramming more cool technology in their products, but that increased the operating expenses, and with lower sales, what happens? Your profits go into the red. And the third reason, the big factor that caused the other two reasons to happen, Pebble lost focus of their vision. Eric admits he never defined a long-term vision for the company. The original Pebble was a huge success on Kickstarter and with sales, but the team was so wrapped up in that success, they weren't truly aware of what their actual primary user base was. The geeky, techie, hacker type people that like to tinker. When Apple Watch came out, Pebble tried shifting to a broader market, but it didn't land with many customers. The Pebble team didn't really market the Pebble Time products and all of those later products outside of the Kickstarter campaign. So awareness of the product wasn't as high as it should have been in the public space. So there's multiple what's that ended up killing Pebble, but if you wanna boil it all down and put a face to it, who killed Pebble? It was Eric. And I don't mean that personally. I have nothing but the utmost respect for Eric. He seems really humble in the pitch videos and he did a great job at building up a great community and those guys are still around. There's still people that love using their Pebbles. I still see some people use them today. And he's a brave SOB. Running a startup is one of the hardest things to do in the world. And I truly appreciate Eric's transparency and accountability that's evident in this article he wrote. He doesn't play the blame game. He took responsibility for what happened. And I believe Eric's core values still to this day resonate throughout the Pebble community. That's how it's able to stay so tight together and still be active. And that kind of energy, that camaraderie combined with projects like Rebble will keep Pebble around for many years to come. And this will also serve as a great lesson for future startups. Also earlier in this episode, you saw me wearing those white Vessi shoes. That's the same brand of shoe that I wore in that iPhone 12 Pro episode I made with Brad a couple of years ago. I love how these shoes look. The white and teal colors always reminded me of the Bondi Blue iMac, but there's many shoe types and colors to choose from. And they're waterproof, so you stay dry. And they have a super light feel. They weigh almost nothing. And they're machine washable for easy cleaning. And I'll tell you a secret. I hate tying laces. But with these Vessis, you can just tie them once and then treat them like a slip on. Or, you know, you can just buy the slip on version. Vessis are just all around great. So if you or someone you know wear shoes, go ahead and get a pair. Check out the Vessi styles at vessi.com/computerclan and use the computerclan code to get 15% off your order. And when you do that, you're also supporting the Computer Clan. So thank you very much. Oh, hang on a second. Oh yeah, I gotta take that shower that I promised. That's not awkward at all. Catch the crazy and pass it on. (upbeat music) (water splashing) AAAAAAHH!!!!",

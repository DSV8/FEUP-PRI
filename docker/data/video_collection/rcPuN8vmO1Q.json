    "description": "The Montblanc Summit 2 is my favorite smartwatch hardware of 2018. With a meaty casing forged from stainless steel or titanium, a beautiful display overlaid with sapphire and the smoothest rotating crown on Wear OS, it's a joy to use. It's also one of the first smartwatches running on Qualcomm's new platform for wearables, the Snapdragon 3100. Most impressive of all: its Timeshifter app helped me avoid jetlag on a trip halfway around the world!  The trouble is, with a starting price of nearly $1000, every one of the Summit 2's shortfalls is magnified a thousandfold. So when the battery life doesn't live up to the promise of that new 3100 platform, and topping it up is a chore thanks to the most frustrating charging cradle I've used in years ... well, that stuff stands out a lot more than it would on a smartwatch costing a quarter the price.  Still think it might be worth the coin, even if only for the Montblanc name? Dive in to the video above for MrMobile's full Montblanc Summit 2 review!   [SUBSCRIBE TO MRMOBILE]     [ABOUT MRMOBILE'S MONTBLANC SUMMIT 2 REVIEW]  MrMobile's Montblanc Summit 2 Review was produced following two weeks with a Montblanc Summit 2 review device provided by Qualcomm. The smartwatch was tested with a BlackBerry KEY2. Off-the-record discussions with two other reviewers at other publications helped confirm battery life and performance notes.

    "transcript": "- Every time I review a luxury tech product I come away thinking I must've missed something. Because, once again, I've got a thousand dollar product on my desk and, once again it's very nice but it seems like the only reason to pay that price is the name on the back. This is the Summit 2 smartwatch from Montblanc and this is the Mr. Mobile review. (upbeat techno music) With a lead in like that you might think I have nothing good to say about this watch but that's not true. In fact, this is my favorite smartwatch hardware of 2018. The 42 millimeter casing is water resistant and weighted so well that, while you can upgrade to a titanium version, I wouldn't want to. It feels just perfect in stainless steel. Also nearly perfect, the 1.2 inch display which is brilliantly bright and pixel packed with the kind of contrasty color that only OLED can provide. While you can of course tap and swipe on the sapphire watch face to interact with the software, any time you have to opportunity to use that rotating side button instead, you should. It's so perfectly synced with the software that it almost feels like some internal spring or string is pulling you through the menus mechanically. And the Montblanc logo on the crown, it's a nice touch too. Even on the software side there's plenty nice to say. Google's new wear OS is exactly the usability and design update the platform needed. And special kudos to Google Assistant, which has gotten much better at giving you important information at any given moment. I mean sometimes it does feel like you're wearing a successories poster on your wrist but, it's okay. Now Montblanc is positioning the Summit 2 as an accessory for globetrotters and to sell that narrative its included two notable apps. Travel info is really basic with an uneven smattering of social advice for different countries which is somehow at once too broad and also weirdly specific. I didn't know about this salt shaker thing in Spain. But the other one, time shifter, that's great. It's basically a coach for helping you minimize jet lag. Tell it where you're going and when and starting a day in advance it'll advise you on when to start and stop drinking coffee, when to get more or less light, and when to go to sleep and wake up. I used it on my trip to Qualcomm's tech summit in Hawaii and it really did help minimize my jet lag while I was there. Now on the way back I did not follow it's advice and uh, well let me tell you, I am still feeling it. (techno music) That's a lot of pluses so, why am I so down on the Summit 2? Well here's the thing, when you're buying a luxury brand part of what you're paying for is the name on the box. What I can't abide is when these upscale brands use that as an opportunity to skimp on the fundamentals. Biggest among these is battery life. The Summit 2 is a one day smartwatch. Meaning you need to charge it every night. That's a huge disappointment because the Qualcomm Snapdragon 3100 inside was specifically designed to give these watches more staying power. I had a chat with Qualcomm about this while I was in Hawaii and while the company VP was careful to avoid assigning blame, I got the sense that the problem might lie in how Wear OS utilizes the hardware. In short, it could be a software thing. Which means it's possible updates could help squeeze more life out of that big battery in the future. Qualcomm did say I wasn't the first to ask these questions. According to reviews the Fossil Sport has similar battery issues on the same chip set. So for now, this isn't a problem unique to Montblanc. But, for the price tag of one Summit 2, you could buy almost four Fossil Sport's or a similar number of Galaxy watches or Fit Bit Ionic's. Each of those last about three to five days per charge. And with any of those watches you wouldn't have to deal with the Summit 2's finicky charging cradle with an old Micro USB port and magnets so weak that it's just a circus to charge this thing. Seriously, it's the worst. Then there's the inconsistent apps. Montblanc offers a world clock, stopwatch, and a timer and the latter is notable for mainly just how slow it feels. By the way the buttons I've set as shortcut's to those apps are also utterly lacking any kind of physical feedback. They don't move at all. And while I really like these watch faces, the complications don't always display properly on the always on display. I keep this one on the left here set to a different time zone and it's basically never correct. (beeps) Finally, take the presentation. This box is serviceable but when I'm paying a thousand dollars I expect not fabric and cardboard, but wood and leather. It's fine if you think I'm crazy for saying so but recall that way back in 2015 Huawei was giving people that exact experience on Android Wear for half the price. If the Summit 2 were half the price, it would be an easy recommendation despite its shortfalls. And I'll say it once more, this is some of the most beautiful hardware you're gonna find in smartwatches. I'm gonna keep it on my wrist right up until the minute Qualcomm asks for it back. But justifying a $995.00 starting price tag to me means you just need to get closer to the summit of perfection then this one does. Folks be sure to keep your eye on the comments. I've reached out to Montblanc about some of the issues with my review device and if the company has a response I'll be sure to include it down there. While you're there be sure to subscribe to theMrMobile on YouTube and for another interesting take on the modern smartwatch checkout my review of LG's watch W7 with analog hands over a digital face. Until next time, thanks for watching. And stay mobile my friends.",

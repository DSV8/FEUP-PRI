    "transcript": "- They told me to be gentle with it, but it's not coming out of the thing. (beep) Last month Xbox Canada, tweeted out that they had created, what they called, the \"Canadian tuxedo\" Xbox controller. A denim jean Xbox controller. So naturally, as a Canadian, and technology enthusiast, I immediately reached out to our Xbox contact, and was like, \"Is this thing real?\" To which happily they replied, \"Yes.\" And then I said, \"Can I have it?\" And they were like, \"Actually, yeah.\" So the video is not about this, this is outta here. It's about this. Inside this box is not, a carbon black controller. Oh my God, it's actually real. That is hilarious. This raises so many more questions than it answers. Like, how? And especially why? And is it actually any good to game on it? You know, that's actually exactly as comfortable, as you might imagine it is. I mean, Brandon, cloth covered controller? Could you get into that? - Yes. - Yeah. - Comfortable - yeah - Soft - Its like, (laughs) it's soft, but functional, you know, it's denim. Now, I said we had more questions than answers, but I also have some more answers to add to our questions. Here is the story. \"At Xbox Canada, we've always been fond of making custom controllers, but in 2021, we wanted to take it to another level, and explore what a Canadian custom controller could be. So apparently they think, we all wear denim, top and bottom. That's interesting. Emerging from a haze of Bing Crosby Letterkenny, Britney Spears, and Justin Timberlake, Circa 2001, the Canadian tuxedo X-Box controller was born. Denim top and denim bottom, the controllers ardorned with all the little details you'd expect, in a Canadian tuxedo. I have never heard, an all denim outfit, called a Canadian tuxedo before. Is that even a thing? Little pockets to hold your toonies, and belt loops, to put your fingers through, when you see a good wall to lean on. (laughs) Okay. All right. You know what X-Box Canada? You definitely got my attention, and I'm not going to lie. I absolutely love it. But you did get a couple of the details wrong here. Number one, these pockets were clearly designed by someone, who has never seen a toonie, in their life. No toonie would fit in there. Quarter? Maybe. Tooney? Absolutely not. Toonie is a pretty big coin. I know you Americans, you got small coins, but we got, we got big coins. If you know what I mean, Brandon, you got a toonie on you? Oh man. You rock dude. Kay, here we go. This is your toonie pocket. (laughs) Also, Justin Timberlake and Brittany Spears, are not Canadian. (laughs) So I don't know. Letterkenny? Yes. Bing Crosby, I actually don't know. I have no idea, it's before my time, but Justin Timberlake and Brittany Spears, are as American as apple pie and bald eagles, which actually by the way, we have bald eagles here. The loops though excellent, of course, when it comes down to for any game controller, is not how, you know, culturally accurate it is necessarily, but how functional it is. And I wanna give this thing a try. Does this battery cover even come up? I gotta give them credit. Considering that the entire purpose of this controller before we asked to play with it, was to like send out a tweet, as far as I can tell, they actually did a bang up job of the quality of the construction. Like these guys are, these are sewn on, everything is sewn on. It's all like tucked in nicely, does it have batteries in it already? That button. So, here's the thing. When you build up high quality products, with very tight manufacturing tolerances, like say this X-Box controller for example, you don't have a lot of gaps around things like buttons. So when you go ahead and you tuck denim, into the cab the first time I pressed this button, it immediately got stuck in there. So, I did say it'd be gentle with it, but I think I might need my knife. I'm not gonna like, intentionally ruin it or anything. It's like just, - [Jono] Sorry Xbox. Yeah Sorry, Sorry X-Box. I just wanna pry the button back out. Can I maybe? (laughs) shit, now what? What do we do? I wanted to play games on it. Oh my God. If I broke it before I even got to play a game on it, the short cable. Oh, okay. Maybe my batteries are just dead, cause it seems like it's working. Your controller needs an update. Now I'm afraid to press buttons. (laughs) Oh my goodness. It just, how many times does pressing the button here? Oh my gosh. Okay. (clears throat) One moment please. This video was brought to you by mine.

(chuckles) Oh my God, did you see how many buttons presses that was? - {Jono] I think you are racing now. - Am I? (chuckles) What? Oh nice. Triggers are fine. Triggers are perfect. So as long as all we need is the stick, and that's weird. You saw that double input I was getting with the sticker earlier, right? Yeah, it feels fine. Oh yeah. I'll press Y to rewind. Oh! the Y button. (laughs) the right button, is not working. Hold on. I've gotten a little accident. What is even happening right now? Oh my goodness. Okay. Camera angle. There we go. Come on, give me the, hey there, Okay, that's fun. I crashed again. You know what though? Man, cloth controller , it would get dirty. Okay, but gamer hygiene, might be a problem, but other than that, it's comfy, cause it's not cold on your hands, like you wouldn't get that, kind of that clammy, like sweaty feeling, I like it a lot. - [Jono] Is this like the equivalent of having carpeted floors? - Yeah. Yeah, It's exactly like having carpeted floors. It's way more comfortable, but, like basically it's disgusting, you know, to be clear I got wall to wall carpet in some parts of my house, like, it's just, it's kinda like clothes, that you could never take off. You know, the only way to wash them is to kinda like scrub them on your body, like you do an okay job, but it's not great. You know, we just gotta understand what it is. Okay. So, functionality, not amazing, but it's not like this is a product that Microsoft is intending to sell or anything like that. It was just a one-off thing that they did for fun. And I'm very grateful, that they were gracious enough, to send it over to me to play with, even though, I mean, they've must have known, that it wasn't gonna work perfectly. So, hey, great job you guys, I think this is super cool, You know, I'm not saying we should have fabric controllers. I'm just saying that, maybe we shouldn't not have fabric controllers, and guys, make sure you subscribe to short circuit, for more, hey, maybe one of a kind unboxings like this, really unique X-Box controllers. We might actually be working on something in ourselves. Alternative materials, Oh yeah.",

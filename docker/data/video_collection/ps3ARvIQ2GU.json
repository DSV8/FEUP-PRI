    "transcript": "- Hey guys, this is Austin, and today I'm here with my very first smartphone. So back in 2011 when I was rocking some seriously sweet hair I picked up one of these guys for 50 bucks, and today it's time to give it another shot. So this is the Palm Pixi Plus. Now I was able to find one of these brand new in the box, and since I didn't have my original one anymore I couldn't resist. As you can see, smartphones have changed just a little bit since then. Oooh, yo! I've legit not held one of these in like five years. It's so tiny. (laughs) So this came out in 2010, and it's totally been sitting in the box since then. So let us enjoy. Oh! Dude, this brings me back. I can't believe how tiny it is. So back in 2010 this was a little bit smaller than most smartphones, but compared to today, I mean, look at it next to a Galaxy S8. It is absolutely tiny. Even though it's small it actually has pretty decent hardware. So something that I really appreciate is the soft touch rubber back. It still feels good even today, but there are definitely some weird quirks here. For example, the power button is sort of tucked away on the corner. The actual micro USB charging is underneath this flap on the side. There's definitely some weirdness, but you have to remember, this was sort of like the Wild West of smartphone days. This was just a few years after the iPhone first came out, Android was brand new, and this was Palm's first big foray into a more modern smartphone with webOS. What? It has battery? (laughs) This has legitimately been sitting in a box for probably seven years now, and yet it just fired right back up. Yo, I'm getting like flashbacks right now. This is so cool. I actually really love this phone. It wasn't just because it was my first smartphone. It was legitimately something pretty cool back in the day. Obviously, smartphones have come a long way. There's no doubt that a new smartphone is much, much superior to this. But there are definitely some things that were not so bad back in the day. It works. Not only does it work, it's like already up and running. What, 50% battery? It even has the date correct, what? It literally just activated it so it's just on on like the first boot. Was this thing actually brand new? So the downside of buying a new webOS device today is that the actual servers to activate them are off. So for example, if you try to turn on like the App Catalog or something, there's no way it's going to connect, because well, it's not even on anymore, which is really weird that this is already activated. Oh no, the YouTube app doesn't work. Oh man. I wanna see what I can actually still do with this. So the first thing is the keyboard is so tiny. Aw, man, it brings back memories though. I actually used to be kind of decent with this keyboard. Oh, that is an old YouTube layout. It works though. Actually something kind of cool is the responsiveness isn't bad. I mean sure, it's not the smoothest and quickest device in the world, but one of the cool things about webOS was it did multitasking really well. So I swipe up. I can go through my open apps, I can just swipe it away. I can also use it as a home button if you want, but it's not bad. Of course I mean inside this guy you're talking about a single core, 600 megahertz processor, basically no memory, eight gigs of storage. I mean, this was not a powerful phone to begin with, but it's actually reasonably smooth, and that was one of the cool things about webOS. So the problem is is that basically all of the apps are so old and have not been updated in so many years that a lot of this stuff is actually just not gonna work, which is ah, that sucks. Even though it might not have apps, it still does have a perfectly functional web browser. So, can I get on Twitter with this? Do it, do it, do it, do it. Oh, 404. Man, I was so excited to finally use a Palm Pixi Plus again, and literally nothing works. It's almost like people don't want to support an ancient phone with software that no one has updated since like 2011. I should just give up right now. Nothing works. You don't have to rub it in, Ken. I get it, okay. This was a bad idea. Palm Pixi Plus is not as functional a phone as I hoped it would be. Oh, you know what does work though, you know what does work, you know what does work, camera works. There we go, there we go. That's a, wait, okay. That was a picture. Boy, that's um, that's a picture. So um-- Let's take like an old school selfie. Oh yeah, it totally took it! That actually is not, okay, well probably shouldn't zoom in on it. I'll just, uh, yeah, alright. Now we've got that sick, sick Palm Pixi video. You have anything to say now, Ken? You wanna tweet this, huh? Wanna tweet this, wanna tweet this? That was uncalled for. I would like to officially and sincerely to Ken Bolido for the rude manner in which I just treated him. Ken, oh, okay, I see, I see. This video took a hard turn. I went from having a great time, \"Look how awesome the Palm Pixi Plus is! \"It's my first smartphone.\" Now I'm like bitter and hating life. Ken is like ready to leave. The video is probably never gonna be finished. But, if you wanna make your own bad decisions, I have two of these because I'm an idiot and thought that the phone was gonna be cool. So, if you wanna win your own Palm Pixi Plus, leave a comment below, subscribe to the channel, and who knows? You too might be the proud owner of a very mildly functioning smartphone from 2010. If that's not a sales pitch to subscribe to the channel, I am afraid to say I don't really know how to do it any better than that. So subscribe to the channel, stay tuned. Videos that are not terrible coming soon, hopefully, if Ken lets me.",

    "transcript": "Hey everyone, it's Colin. How's it going? The Bluetooth speaker market is pretty crowded, so it's tough for new products to stand out. Let's take a look at one that promises good sound quality and battery life, but has an extra trick up its sleeve. This is the Trakk Go. The company was kind enough to send me one to check out and review. At first glance, it looks like a typical speaker with metal front and rear grills and a silicone covering on the rest of the body. But despite its compact size, it's decently heavy and feels very solid and sturdy. As you'd expect, it features Bluetooth for use with mobile devices, and includes NFC to speed along the pairing process. It has a built-in mic and can work as a speakerhone, and the packaging boasts compatibility with Siri and S Voice. It charges through micro-USB, and has a run time of about 12 hours if you don't get too crazy with the volume. Though, if you need it to get loud, it can certainly deliver. Trakk claims that the Go features 20 watts of power, and I found it to be easily capable of filling a garage, a patio, or even a small backyard. And the sound is surprisingly rich. The bass is robust and deep, and while the mids are a bit thin, the high end is clear, but not harsh. Here, have a listen. [] It's some of the little touches that also help this speaker in terms of value. In addition to an analog aux input, there's also a USB port so it can function as a power bank. The buttons on top light up automatically when your hand gets near. And finally, there's a microSD card slot on the back for playing back music on its own. Now, the transport controls are limited; there's no shuffle feature, for example, and it'll only play .mp3 format files, but the Go will work with larger-capacity SDXC cards. The thing that I think helps this speaker really stand out is hinted at by its outer silicone covering. A lot of Bluetooth speakers offer some sort of weather resistance, but this one claims to be IP67 rated, just like a lot of newer smartphones, so I made sure that the port cover on the back was closed up tight, then gave it a dunk. [] That rating means it's waterproof down to 1 meter for up to 30 minutes. It's unlikely you'll ever hit either of those numbers, though, because the Go can float. I wouldn't necessarily get in the habit of taking it underwater, but it's nice to know that the speaker should be fine if you accidentally leave it out in the weather or knock it into the pool. So overall, the Trakk Go offers rich sound quality and a solid feature set in a package you can take anywhere. Add to the fact that it's waterproof, and this is one Bluetooth speaker that can live up to its name. Big thank-you to Trakk for sending out a Go to me to review. I'll include links down in the description if you're interested. If you liked the video I'd appreciate a thumbs-up, and be sure to subscribe if you haven't already. You can follow me on Twitter and Instagram @thisdoesnotcomp and as always, thanks for watching.",

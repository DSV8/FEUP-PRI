    "transcript": "so this is the Dell XPS 13 2 in 1 that's right a tune one and I'm sure a lot of you might not be interested in this type of device which I totally respect and this is by no means a gaming laptop it's really good for people who prefer switching between a traditional laptop orientation to a tablet now what's really interesting about this device is its form factor it's fairly lightweight and it packs some power efficient specs what are we talking here well it's got the new 10 gen isolate processor the core i7 1065 g7 16 gigabytes of RAM 500 gigabytes of a storage and HDR 400 certified IPS display powered by Intel's Gen 11 graphics these are interesting specs since the standard Dell XPS 13 is now using comic Lake while they're convertible notebooks like this one are getting ice Lake and the price of this particular config is 1750 but Dell always has a sale going on all the time so you could pick this up for less than $1,600 and the Canadian price for this guy goes for around $2,500 which is it's a lot of money now for those of you who are keeping track of our isolate coverage we have reviewed the razer blade stealth featuring the isolate processor and a gtx 1650 discrete graphics card so if you're interested in that review I'll link it right over here but why don't we get to this but first a quick message from our sponsor the new cooler master master mouse 710 a weird name but damn this thing is good with an ultra lightweight body it's only 53 grams for excellent flick control and aim correction the ultra weave cable is awesome for Wireless like feel the ambidextrous shape for me personally is super comfortable and then like the shorter body plus the glide is smooth thanks to white PTFE feet enjoy the domination with an excellent optical sensor and despite the funky name the cooler master mm 7/10 is legit check it out below alright so let's start with the design and expense notebooks have been known for their amazing build quality and this one is absolutely no different there are two finishes available a standard silver one with a black interior and the arctic white which I have over here and it costs $50 more I'm worried about how long it'll stay clean but if you like white MacBook looking products then this one is for you I like the grip of the palm rest it definitely complements the typing experi and the edges of the notebook are not too sharp which makes it easier to type on opening the lid elevates the keyboard a bit which gives it a slightly more ergonomic typing position overall the build quality is really good with very little flex when opening or pressing down on the lid the only issue we found is that when the notebook is opened past a certain point the metal edges can scratch some surfaces since the bumpers are large enough now about the keyboard I know some people have said that they love it but the keys are absolutely be worse that I've encountered on a notebook it feels like typing on a cheap version of the Microsoft Surface cover and not a notebook there's hardly any key travel no feedback it feels dead and when I compared this to the HP spectre x360 it's a day and night difference there's actual proper travel the students tears feedback it actually feels like you're typing on a keyboard and honestly this is by far one of the best keyboards I've encountered versus the XPS this is absolutely a no-go in my books the power button is located beside the Delete key and it acts as a fingerprint sensor which doesn't actually work all that well and to make matters worse the LED backlighting is just embarrassing I mean look at it the lighting doesn't even shine through the key caps properly since each key seems to have something blocking the light in the middle that makes it look like there's a shadow underneath they're not even bright and some keys are noticeably dimmer than others ironically I had to turn off the backlighting to differentiate the keys during darker environments this is just an absolute terrible terrible implementation from Dell in my opinion on the positive side the trackpad is great it does feature Windows position drivers so gesture controls work flawlessly and it is fairly wide enough so that you can use all of your my fingers to do your thing so I guess that's a good thing port selection is extremely limited on the XPS 13 2 in 1 which is unforgivable on such an expensive device in my opinion on the left hand side you get a Type C Thunderbolt 3 port and a micro SD card reader yep that's absolutely pointless switching to the right you'll find an audio jack and another type seat out of all three port and that's it so no full size HDMI or a type-a port which means if you have one of them occupied by just powering or charging up a notebook you only have one available which means you can either only uses an external hard drive but then you can't use a mouse if you plan on you know using that or other accessories you might have to go for an external dongle Dell does offer a USB type-c to type a adapter now for instance if I were to bring back the HP Spectre x360 this actually comes with a full size type-a port and two USB type-c port so that at least gives you the option the speakers are actually really good for a 13-inch notebook they are not front-facing but rather they're on each side of the notebook and they bounce back the surface of a table so this is the webcam test on the XPS 13 2 in 1 and guys it is absolutely terrible I mean welcome to 2019 where you spend eighteen hundred dollars on a laptop and this is what you get it's kind of unacceptable as you can see Michaels same Society for behind me you can't even see I mean he's completely this is potato quality it's a worse sapote to quality in my opinion and what's even interesting is that as I was doing my recording or as I was testing the microphone I noticed in some files there were some audio cracklings in the vo so I'm gonna play back some footage of that and yeah I mean if you guys think the webcam is this is a chest this is just a test to see because we just noticed something very interesting so yeah that's it that's the webcam quality it's horrible the display is a thirteen point four inch w led touchscreen with a resolution of 1920 by 1200 so it's a sixteen by ten aspect ratio and there is a 4k option available but that will cost you an extra three hundred dollars the colors look fantastic I mean you've got great new handles amazing contrast ratios it's also a very sharp panel and very bright with HDR 400 and Dolby vision supports so outdoor visibility shouldn't be an issue though it is a glossy screen so do take note of that alright so let's talk about one of the main selling points for this device the fact that it can act as a tablet a standard notebook or just a screen when in tablet mode I don't really find it comfortable to hold it doesn't close as flat compared to the HP the HP was certainly a lot more smoother and more comfortable to hold in tablet mode touch input works really well and the display does exhibit some wobbling but overall it's pretty sturdy now in tent mode the device is pretty stable but before you place the men do keep in mind that the metal frame does not have any bumpers so you could end up scratching the surface of this device the power adapter is very small so you can easily toss us in your backpack you shouldn't worry about taking too much space the power connector for the XPS has an illuminated tip so it's super easy to find in the dark in terms of upgradability well unfortunately you can't upgrade anything on the XPS 13 2 in 1 because the ramp and the SSD are soldered in so basically if you want to spec this thing out you better do it while you're buying it now before I talk about battery life I do have to talk about the charging experience because it takes forever so the last 25% takes over 2 hours to complete which is certainly frustrating battery life on the other hand is really impressive so on our light load tests refreshing a Chrome web page for 15 seconds the system lasted for around 10 hours it's not as great as the x360 but that's because it has a bigger battery and of course a whiskey leak i7 processor under heavy load the XPS lasted for around 2 hours and now on to gaming performance is the I select processor any good does the gentleman graphics make any difference compared to the UHD graphics on previous generation well I'll be comparing three notebooks so you have the XPS 13 2 in 1 with the isolate processor the 1065 g7 and iris pro graphics that CPU operates in a 25 watt mode the HP spectre x360 which has a previous gen whiskey'll a core i7 85 65 u operates in 25 watt mode last contender is the razer blade stealth 13 with the gtx 1650 max q it really isn't the same category but it also uses the 1065 g7 as dell but in a 15 watt configuration so it'll be interesting to see the cpu benchmarks starting things off with synthetics the dell performs really good with serious benefits over the h and whiskey like cpu it's also interesting to see what happens with the 15 watt spec razer included it's even slower than the HP in multi-core benchmarks moving on to some rendering benchmarks with Corona renderer and blender they are pretty interesting blender sees a pretty significant advantage for the 25 watt isolate processor in the XPS but with Corona add-in for 3ds max things were a bit odd since the technically slower CPU in the razor blade stuff one here and why is that well the razer has better cooling solutions so it's claw speeds remain higher than the XPS during the test moving on to premier and of course the stealth is a big winner here since it uses the gtx 1650 to accelerate rendering times the isolate processor in the XPS did offer a lot more performance than the x360 though switching over to some light gaming I was pleasantly surprised by what isolate offered here it's nothing closer to the blade stealth but huge improvements over previous generation you can actually get some light gaming done on this provided the Intel drivers behave properly one other interesting thing is that the XPS 13 throttles clock speeds while it's being charged so the only way to get full performance is when it's plugged in and the battery is full it went all the way down to 1.7 gigahertz while the other two notebooks were perfectly fine now based on some of the benchmarks you might have realized by now that temperatures are a bit of a concern under heavy multi-core workload like in Corona or blender the clock speeds shoot up to 3.5 gigahertz on all four cores but a few minutes later package temperature hits 96 C and the CPU down clocks to 2.7 gigahertz or even less the XPS 13 is really quiet until that happens and then the fans pick up speed Dell did a good job and even under full load the sound never really got annoying for exterior heat I wouldn't want this on my lap when rendering a video but otherwise temperatures didn't get to worrying levels alright so I mean it's time to conclude this video Dell and Intel have worked closely together to showcase what the XPS 13 and the new I say processor can offer but is this the laptop that's more than a laptop no because in my opinion the keyboard is shockingly bad the two non functionality is not really the greatest especially when compared to the HP Spectre x360 and then the minimal or the limited amount of ports I think that's the biggest drawback of this notebook two USB type-c ports that's nothing because that would actually make you want to invest in Bluetooth accessories which is an additional investment on top of what you're already paying for this machine not to mention there is thermal throttling under light gaming loads or even heavy multi-core workloads so that's something to consider but if I take a step back and re-evaluate what Isaac has to offer there are a few positive things about it the first things most obvious CP before it's actually really good compared to the previous generation whiskey lake processors you can actually game on it as well do a little bit of low gaming because the gen 11 graphics is actually pretty impressive and this number also offers great battery life you've also got Wi-Fi 6 so there's future-proofing down the line and it's got great build quality but when I pay $1,500 for it no because while the performance is great I just feel like the rest of notebook still leaves a lot to be desired We certainly have a few notebooks with Comet Lake processors coming in so that'll be interesting to test out but until then I'm ebar with hardware canucks thank you so much for watching make sure to check out some relevant content over here subscribe for some more cool content and also make sure to hit that notification bell so that you don't miss out on a new video I'm setting off and I'll talk to you guys in the next one",

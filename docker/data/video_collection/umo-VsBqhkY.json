    "transcript": "- You'd never know what's in this box, but I know. (grunts) (box clunks onto desk) And it's cool. Govee sponsored this video to check out their AI box, and they actually wrote, \"Oh, Merry Christmas! Dear Linus,\" Not me. \"Within this package you'll find something we are hugely proud of. AI Gaming Sync Box\". Is it a box? Is it a sync? I don't know. \"Your journey begins, now\". User manual. I'm, I'll probably need this later, but right now I'm skipping it. This is the heart of it all right here. Look at that IO. What is all this stuff? Oh, okay. Tier number one looks like some included lights in the box. They're kinda like tower lights, but they do have some command strips on the base and it looks like there's probably some kind of foot that's gonna connect onto there. It's nice that it actually comes with lights because what this product is is this brain controlling your lights in a very intelligent way. In fact, they say they're the first AI smart light thing that does this. And what does it do? It takes your content on your screen, your monitor, or your TV and then shines the light around your TV, around your room with lighting that matches. So it increases your immersion to what you're watching, because you know a flash-bang grenade goes off and all your lights shine white, or just generally speaking the, the light that's on the frame in the content you're watching kind of extends beyond your TV and it really just brings you in. It's a cool effect. What are these three kings? This is probably the power adapter for the whole box, I would guess. Just a wall adapter. and a barrel connector on the other end. What are all these guys? Tiny little screws, tiny little screwdriver, Phillips. Some kind of clips with 3M tape on them. And another box of similar. A little alcohol prep pad. I guess this is for cleaning the part of your wall or desk that you're gonna stick something to, so. Clean and dry. Okay, this is an RGB strip. How long is that puppy? \"Please spread out the strip light before connecting the power supply\". Okay, that's not the length. It looks long. Oh, these must be the feet. They look like a Govee logo, which is kind of cool. There they go with those tiny screws. Govee Sued by Sega. You have three different HDMI imports, including one with ARC. So I probably would connect my AVR to that. But you could also directly go in from, like, let's say from your PlayStation, your your PC or your Nvidia shield or something like that. And then there's one outport. So you just go from this HDMI out to your display but there's also USB-Cs and that's where you can directly plug in, for example these lights to there. Let's set it up. All right. We did some setup, cooking show style. So I got my HDMI run, PC to here, here to the display. And then now I'm ready to plug in the power. And I save this because, check this out. Even more RGB than you thought you were gonna get. That's cool. Now another thing I noticed was these tower lights are actually designed to face the wall. And you can tell because the cable comes out on the light side. So they're meant to go like this. They still look pretty smart even though they're kind of facing away from you, you got the Govee logo there. And what's cool is you can see just from plugging it in, it's already working. It's already showing the blue and purple that's on the screen. It's even doing it on the right plane matching the wallpaper. That's pretty cool. CogniGlow is Govee's AI algorithm that's gonna be fed audio and visual information through HDMI and then sync that information to the lighting, accordingly. And all of this intelligence is stuffed into this little hardware box which has an efficient and powerful processor inside. It's so powerful. Govee claims it's equivalent to the A-14 chip from Apple that was found in the iPhone 12. And the box comes with all these cool lights. So you have everything you need. Hey, it's blue, but so is that wall. So let's get something else going on. I got my browser open. Look how quick that responds. I can, I can't alt-tab to nothing. I can Windows-M. Look at that. It can actually interpret up to 60 frames a second, including when I'm doing some 4K gaming. So let's do that now. It currently supports three games, League of Legends Apex Legends, and what other type of Legends? Valorant. So what do they mean by supported games? Well, you'll actually get custom bespoke lighting effects depending on the game. So for example, in League of Legends, when you get a double-kill the lights flash pink and if you get a triple-kill they go from purple to pink and then they move in all sorts of circles and it's a great time. And then in Apex Legends you get the lights turning from purple to red to show the whole Phoenix effect process. And then for the med kit the lights turn from red to green to show that process. And if you win the game, the lighting is gonna flicker red, yellow and blue like a cheerful firework display. So that's the kind of out of display immersive experience you can get with the three supporter games now. But in 2023 we're gonna see that library expand. Just fill my screen with this. Yeah, let's go! Whoop-woo-whoop! It's hard to appreciate the extra immersion you get when you're this close to a big monitor already ready. Although I, I do feel like it's kind of sucking me in 'cause it's, it just makes kind of more of your room the game. And I might sense it even more with a movie, though. That's pretty sweet! - [Man In The Background] The other guys (indistinct) - Whoop-woo! Yeah, what is my team think of me? This guy's trying to stab me. See that? Does it, can I open this thing? Oh my god! That looks really nice. It's almost like it gives you HDR in a way because it's adding brightness, right? So when you go to a bright shot like these, these nice white-pink cherry blossoms you get that extra wow factor just from by virtue of these lights changing to white. Sweet! Now in the app, they actually give you some tools to change this. You might want to have these lights be a different brightness relative to your TV and which you can adjust here. And a really important one is the sensitivity slider. So right now it's set to 100 and you can see that the lights changing is really flickery. So when it changes colors, it's, it's very distinct and I would actually call that distracting. But luckily you can turn that down so it has more of a smooth transition, eases into the different color changes. And that is way more natural. I would definitely keep it. That would be my personal preference. Love that they have that included. Another clutch setting is, \"Part Versus All\". When you have it on, \"All\", it only displays a single color across all the LEDs. But when you put it on, \"Part\", now the LEDs are illuminated according to different regions of the screen. So in this particular Windows 11th stock desktop background, you've got more blue in the middle and darker on the sides. And that's exactly what we see on the LED strip on the back. There's a lot brighter blue, right here. And these are pretty much dimmer and darker. It's a really cool system and I can't wait to see it expand to other lights in their ecosystem 'cause they've got some wacky ones. I like that bendy one, that Linus got. So look for this product to come out at the end of March, 2023. And thanks Govee again for sponsoring this video. So thanks for watching guys.

    "transcript": "So this week was nuts for Apple They announced so much stuff at WWDC New iMacs, new iPad Pros, new MacBooks, new MacBook Pros You can actually expect a video on this brand new 13-inch MacBook in a day or so So stay tuned for that But first I want to talk about what was most interesting to me Kind of the surprise announcement of the show That Space Gray, iMac Pro Now, even though Apple had the iMac Pro out in the floor this week They had it locked down.. They didn't want no one touching this or getting fingerprints on it But that Space Gray was so attractive that naturally I had to sneak in there when no one was looking Unfortunately that was about as far as I could get without getting kicked out of the show But, I did get a chance to spend pretty a solid amount of time with it Talked to Apple, with that, I thought I could answer some questions you might have If there's anything that's not covered Go and drop me a line (he meant comment) down below First and foremost, I'm sure the biggest question floating around right now IS \"Is the iMac Pro the replacement of Mac Pro?\" The short answer is \"No\" I talked to Apple and they stressed and reiterated There is a brand new completely redesign modular Mac Pro coming in 2018 But for now, this is kind of like an option between the iMac and the Mac Pro and for those who need more power now or technically later this year Now aside from the surprising amount of power packed inside this iMac Pro if you missed it It comes in Space Gray, which looks amazing... I don't care if you're a part of the PC Master Race or you're a Mac user There is no denying, this is a beautiful machine On top of the Space Gray finish for the iMac, you also get a matching peripheral sets You get a Space Gray Trackpad, a Wireless Keyboard with Number Pad. Even though I'll personally never use it, you also get a space grey magic mouse Looks aside though, ultimately it comes down to the power and what is packed inside these iMac Pros Like I talked in my latest video, I didn't think I would ever see the day where I use 18-Core and iMacs in the same sentence But it is happening Out of the box, these comes configured with 8 Core Xeon Processors but could be bumped up to a 10 Core processor or an insane 18 Core Which if you think about it, is insane on an iMac Now on-top of the sheer CPU power they're not messing around with graphics either Inside, you have an AMD Vega Graphics either an 8GB or 16GB flavors I think what's cool with this is that those Vega Graphics aren't even out yet So it is brand new technology The current and now super dated Mac Pro, when that came out, it was kinda using almost recycled GPUs but with this, it is cutting edge and completely new Now admittedly what gets me excited and pulls on those nerd heart strings of mine are flash storage and SSD Performance and not only the recent Macs, whether it's MacBooks, MacBook Pros, iMacs, Apple has been killing it with SSD performance With these iMac Pro you can configure them out to a crazy 4TB of flash storage Which is beautiful What has me super curious though If you look at this note here, that says \"Dual SSD options\" So I'm curious, do you have the option for a second drive Or, if you opt for that crazy 4TB SSD Does that mean you're gonna get two 2TB SSD in a Raid Which would be insanely fast As far as memory goes, these are the first iMacs that could be configured up to a 128GB of RAM So there is no shorts of power no matter where you look So unfortunately, with that memory.. It is non-user upgradable I have confirmed this, I think ultimately what it comes down to is the cooling that Apple had engineered inside this iMac Just to make this possible They said something along the line that it is 80% more efficient as far as cooling goes in these standard iMacs Which is kinda crazy if you think about it It definitely kinda suck not being able to upgrade your own RAM Especially on what is being called a \"Pro\" machine but I guess it kinda paved away for the Mac Pros It's gonna be user upgradable modular machine and the iMac Pro kinda is what it is Now as far as connectivity goes, I was little surprised with these iMac Pros Especially with what Apple did with the iPhone 7 (he meant headphone jack) and the new MacBook Pros, those only had USB-C ports so I kinda assume naturally that route not only for the new iMac Pro, but the new iMac as well and that did not happen at all With these iMac Pros you get a headphone jack, SD Card slot, 4 USB 3.0 ports, 4 Thunderbolt 3 Ports in USB-C form factor and last but not least, a 10 Gigabit Ethernet port which is awesome Ultimately what it comes down to is that you gotta put things into perspective This is using Xeon Processors, graphics that aren't even out yet especially on the PC side of things Workstation memory, insanely fast flash storage I think the biggest thing that most people forget about is that all this comes with a beautiful 5k Display Now again, this is not intended to be a PC versus Mac war If you're all about that PC Master Race life, awesome You can incredibly powerful machines, For myself, I use Final Cut Pro to edit. It is what I use everyday, that's where iMac Pro makes sense Ultimately at the end of the day, you're gonna stack these side by side to compare the iMac Pro against a comparable PC Workstation, NOT Gaming PC but PC Workstation. I think you'd be surprised as far as price goes Personally, I am excited.

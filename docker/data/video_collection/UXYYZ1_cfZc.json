    "description": "The Fractal Define 7 is the latest case in a long lineup of Fractal cases and its supposed to be one of their best PC gaming cases yet.  But the Define 7 review might also prove that we have reached peak case, where companies just can't really innovate anymore.

    "transcript": "good people are mitri and honestly i was pretty excited to receive the new fractal design closure to meet our 2020 expectations and it wasn't until I start to work with the case that I start to question whether or not we have reached the whole idea of a peak case I've always associated the fine series as extremely stable flexible and user-friendly from a PC building perspective and the new define 7 is no exception by default it's a fantastic yet kind of the same enclosure we've always gotten yes they got rid of the are for even more minimalistic product name and the price has also increased to 159 and 160 nine for solid and tgd options in variety of colors as usual and the reason why I questioned whether or not where this P case scenario is because all the changes that accompany the define 7 are minor and either improve the user experience or are different for the sake of being new so let's explore everything that define 7 has to offer and perhaps this should be your next case after this looking for the coolest r-tx 20 series GPUs or as has you covered with their efficient wind forced a cooling system along with a gorgeous RGB ring illumination and i/o that's jacked for the most flexible multi-monitor setup and the ability to experience ray tracing for current and upcoming games learn more down below alright so first of all all the staple elements from the fine series are of course still present like the brushed aluminum front door with side insulation it still only opens to about 90 degrees with now a new mechanism which you can still swap to open from the other side the panel is magnetic but unfortunately is fairly loose and behind it is our usual dust filter with angle down ventilation along with a separate cover for the five the quarter inch drive bay that by default is covered by the fan but you can always shift those down if you're installing an optical drive in that spot I will dive into out of box air flow cooling right away and I think everyone expected this already the front panel is fairly restrictive and there's an 8 degrees Celsius difference on the CPU with the front panel completely removed but all those airflow barriers actually deliver in the extremely quiet noise profile to all with additional help of noise absorbing foam spread on all of the solid panels on the interior there is a massive dust filter at the bottom removed from the front and the i/o has grown with the addition of a type C gen to port plus we still have four USB ports and separate audio jacks the side panels no longer have any thumb screws you simply pull the top tab and the panel comes off we have some pegs at the bottom and the top to help with the panel installation and you can also secure both side panels at the front if you plan on transporting the case the biggest change with the 7 is the top frame that I welcome so they've removed the whole module and system and now we either have a totally solid top panel or once you pop it out just like the side panels we have a ventilated cover available as part of the accessories now on the one hand I appreciate the ventilation pattern consistency it's on the top the PSU shroud and the rear ventilation - and I love the dust filter design but they don't really work together visually and actually make the top of the case look really busy and out of sync at least dust filter is a fine mesh but together they look quite bad the top fan bracket is all so new now removal from the side instead of the top giving you a completely open frame to work with which is nice we have our usual fill port and strips for mounting cooling hardware and unusual fractal approach the define 7 can accommodate a ton of fans and radiators here's the graphic for an all faint option with and without the optical drive the case is long enough for a reason so you can do a 420 write up top and up to a 360 at the front even mounting radiators at the bottom is an option too and for anyone doing a place to do a radiator loop the define 7 accommodates that well as long as the motherboard height does not exceed 36 millimeters as for the interior the layout is identical to define our 6 with EA TX support great rubber grommet placement and I gotta say I love the whole white on black color scheme with an all new PSU shroud that I'm very happy to see the removable front sections are plastic now no longer metal and now removable without any issues you just simply pop them out which was not the case with the r6 that was a difficult thing to work with and so this gives you either 6 centimeters of clearance or 18 centimeters and also lets you access the bottom drive cage that you can either remove or shift back depending on your front configuration you can also convert the interior to house more drive caddies just like what the r6 comes in by default by moving the back wall forward and then mounting the metal caddies behind it this closes off the front of the case but still lets you mount front and top radiators which is nice and finally the case comes with three 140 ml 1000 rpm fans to the front and one in the rear with a new fan hub located in this perfect Center top position with six three pin connectors and three four pin connectors of course with PWM control I love the addition of this new PSU shroud cover even though it is behind a side panel and not visible it does help with cable management along with these new plastic channels that guide all your cables where they need to be and securely tightened with darker straps now all these elements have evolved over time to give us the same mechanics of building a computer but it's never been easier which is how I think we're in this plateau of case innovation now the thing is it doesn't only apply to define 7 because if you look at any fantasies released they're reusing the same internal frame and adding modifications to the exterior just simplifying the overall user experience the same thing with NZXT with the H500 series H700 and above and so that's what the define 7 is all about - but honestly this peak case is also a bit underwhelming the riskiest thing that fractal design has done we did define 7 is remove the R from the model name because everything else almost feels expected it's not a bad case but it's not a very exciting one either but that's really been the thing with the define series from the beginning I love the simple exterior and the complexity on the interior to make sure that the overall user experience is fantastic and it is what define 7 I do think that we have to accept these mainstream hair products for what they are because they are safe and they will sell and hope for more risky releases sometime in the future so that's the define 7 let me know what you think of this case I'm three tree thanks much for watching as usual all the links will be in the description below for cases and other recommendations check out this other relevant content and I'll see you in the next video",

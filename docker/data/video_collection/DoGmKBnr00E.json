    "transcript": "you know when you have one of those ideas that seem good at the time like oh i should do viewer pc reviews because i think it would be cool to have an intimate look at the kind of systems that you use kind of like a pc equivalent of antiques roadshow i guess and then i got a submission which was way too intriguing to ignore with its semi-obscured flirtatious photos of whatever's going on over there however when i got it into the office i realized i may have gotten a bit more than i bargained for i mean just look at this thing it's barely been in the office a couple hours and it's already started terraforming the local ecosystem however before we have a look at this pc spawned in mount doom it's time for today's video sponsor today's video is sponsored by thermaltake and their tower 100 series of itx cases that come in a fancy assortment of colors so that you can easily match it with your dog the tower 100 cases come with a button of ventilation so that your system doesn't have to run hot there's also plenty of space for a big gpu a tower cooler and even a normal atx power supply other than that you've got three tempered glass panels so that you have like a display case with your little gaming pc in it which looks awesome if this looks good to you check out the thermal take tower 100 linked in the description below thank you thermaltake for sponsoring today's video now in order to more easily refer to this pc over the course of this video i am going to be giving it a name and considering that it looks like how i imagine the inside of matthew mcconaughey's jock strap looks like i'm gonna be calling this system the mcconaughey now the main thing that concerns me about the mcconaughey aside from the fact that it just generally looks like it was recently dug out from under centuries worth of natural sediment is the state of the side panel now you may be thinking darvit this side panel doesn't look any more grotesque than the rest of the pc but matthew mcconaughey was saying that he runs the system without the side panel on which means the side panel ended up in this condition without even being attached to the pc like how did that happen but anyway that definitely means that we're going to need some valida action for this video okay so now that i've got my protection on we can get into the parts breakdown now as far as the case goes i'm pretty sure this is a first generation cooler monster cm690 with a dvd drive in the front around the back well there's a lot going on back here um i think that there may be a fan underneath all of this growth that's happening up here although aside from that we do have a very interesting rear i o for a motherboard here i i don't know what motherboard we're gonna be working with oh the fact that i need to sneeze is so concerning because it means i'm sneezing out this disgusting pc oh no now in terms of the graphics card it has what looks like too many display port outs which is it's interesting uh we also have an ethernet card and a sound card and what are some of the most unkept liquid cooling buttholes i think i've ever seen and then finally we have a power supply with an unbelievably chunky switch oh oh listen to that switch that is amazing and on that note it's time to open up this system and see how many yet to be discovered species of animal are living in here oh that's really stuck on that oh oh no way is that a bottle cap in here and there's another one in here that's kind of made a nest for itself and it's also seemed to collect some money well the money actually looks weirdly clean i'm i'm just gonna kinda i'm just gonna put that back now once you get over the fact that there's likely enough human skin in the system to build an entirely new person out of and i guess new probably isn't the right word more like a used person but anyway once you get over that fact and the fact that the cables look less managed and more exploded inside of mcconaughey here there's actually a really dope pc under all of that the motherboard for example is a gigabyte x58oc which is just a primo ass x58 board to put into perspective just how fancy this motherboard is if it was a person it would own a holding company that owns a company that launches penis rockets into space and it would primarily wipe its ass with swan necks you know a motherboard is serious when it's got that many buttons on it and soldering points damn and then look at this power supply it's a thousand watt eighty plus platinum sea sonic unit this thing is a complete beefcake oh now interestingly the reason matthew mcconaughey gave for this amazing power supply is that he did a whole bunch of folding at home with the system for the ncix team and at a point he actually had three graphics cards in the system all collecting dead skin um so yeah that's why he invested in this just insane power supply and then under the cpu cooler there is an intel i7 980 which was a herculean six core chip in a generation full of quad cores and actually the more i look around the system the more i think that this heinous abomination that is the cable management is actually kind of justified in this case because well the motherboard tray is raised and there is a grommet for motherboard power to go up through the top the problem is just that these cables are quite chunky and the motherboard tray is barely lifted so i actually don't think that this cable has any other route that it can take to the cpu power and then also in terms of this pile there there isn't much that you can do about it because i guess you can hide some of it back here but it this is just an old difficult case to cable manage and it kind of makes sense that it turned out like this by that i mean the cable management not the small animal that's growing on the cables ram wise we've got three mushkin sticks which i don't know mushkin's brand name has always it just feels really dirty to say for some reason the sticks do seem to be mismatched but they look like they're quite sexy mushkin snakes and then graphics card wise under this cocoon of discarded human we have an r9 280 which with its three gigs of frame buffer may struggle a bit with modern games and i am actually very excited to see how that graphics card holds up these days actually just generally this system considering that this pc knew was what baby darvit went dreams were made of now for privacy reasons i did ask matthew mcconaughey to remove his hard drives from the mcconaughey because you know i don't want to accidentally steal his identity or whatever so yeah unfortunately i'm gonna have to sacrifice one of my ssds to this hellscape i'm sorry buddy but you're the chosen one for this terrible expedition okay so first thing i guess is to fish the sata cable out of the bottle caps nest and then we're just gonna have to pick a sata power cable i guess oh i'm not i'm not plugging that bit in because that's i don't wanna oh okay well most of it's come off so maybe maybe it's okay maybe we can use this but just kind of dust it off a bit and then plug it in here and then i'll kind of wedge it in like that so that it can touch as little of its surroundings as possible okay it's time to power it up hopefully it doesn't fart out a cloud of flesh eating bacteria like the last dirty piece i had to look at there we go oh it's got like disgusting bicycle streamers around them oh look at that bios now on the note of this bios it may look like something written in 1923 but considering that this was an extreme overclocking motherboard the bios does have comprehensive settings for overclocking look at all them overclocking features has experienced booth failures because of overclocking or changed voltages i'm not going to change any of this stuff because i don't want to play around with overclocking someone else's pc like that that feels a bit weird it does seem like it's reverted it to its stock frequencies here now there's no point making fun of the windows install because well it's mine uh so let's have a look at what kind of speeds the the stuff is running at okay well here we have our 980 which is an awesome cpu and then our 12 gigs of unknown speed 400 megahertz oh no what's what's happening here six six yeah it's running at the base frequency okay so what we'll do is we'll do some performance tests and then i'll ask matthew mcconaughey if it's fine for me to re-enable the xmp profiles for the ram and see what kind of performance difference that makes now the first game we're trying as always is gta 5 this is a 1080p high settings i think gaming with velita gloves on is just so hard oh yeah see i keep accidentally pressing no i didn't mean to press the ah okay i'm just no no no okay there we go that's better yeah this is this is fine uh 1080p and we're getting above 60 frames per second it's it's holding up okay interestingly though we do seem to be having a bottleneck going on here like you can see that the gpu's not maxed out and the cpu is also not maxed out i think it is maybe the ram speed i mean in all fairness the cpu is only running at 3.5 gigahertz now next i thought i tried do maternal to see how this runs uh the game wouldn't let me apply any higher than low at 1080p uh because of the three gig frame buffer and it makes sense because we're already running into that frame buffer oh there is a bit of input lag here there are moments of clarity where the input lag kind of clears up oh and we are also getting some visual artifacting happening as well oh there is a lot of artifacting oh doom does not like this pc very much wow this really does run surprisingly similarly to that acer loser nitro suckface edition uh from the previous video uh although the temperatures are quite a lot higher with battlefield v and that's probably why matthew mcconaughey runs this system without the side panel on okay the cpu is getting too hot for my liking just got to put my valida back on and then let's see how much opening it up helps a few moments later yeah i'd say it's helping maybe and then finally i just want to see how kitty knight runs this is a 1080p competitive settings if it runs anything like that acer loser nitro suck face edition pc it's not going to be too bad i mean honestly it runs fine like it's it's perfectly usable uh there there are some visual glitches going on as you can see here i've never seen fortnite do that before um but aside from stutters and visual glitches it runs fine you know it's it's perfectly usable and then finally i thought we just need to really abuse the system and see what happens with cyberpunk 2077. wow we are really hovering around that cinematic frame rate uh that everybody is so excited about this is not going too great i think cyberpunk is pretty much out of the question although if you think about it it kind of makes sense for matthew mcconaughey to game at 24 frames per second now at this point i messaged mr mcconaughey and asked him if it was fine for me to enable xmps on the system to see what kind of performance effect it had and he said go ahead the problem was i couldn't get the system to boot at any speed higher than 1333 megahertz i tried just enabling the x and p profiles that didn't work i then tried to manually set the frequency with the timings and that also didn't work i spent quite a long time playing around in the bios and i just couldn't get the system to boot at any faster speed than that which meant unfortunately i couldn't test the performance difference that that would make in this system which sadly brings us to the end of our time with the mcconaughey thank you very much mr mcconaughey for graciously letting me use the mcconaughey for this video and yeah other than that thank you very much for watching and until the next video bye",

    "transcript": "now according to Amazon in this pretty small box it looks like it was carried to my house in the mouth of a T-Rex there is a gaming PC a monitor a keyboard a mouse and a headset and all of it cost about three hundred dollars hmm I don't know but before we check it out today's video is sponsored by a monster of a power supply with a frankly obscene amount of peels per inch not only that but the be quiet dark Power Pro 13 has a switch on the back that unfailingly rustles the gentleman's vegetables oh so if you're in the market for an heirloom power supply with huge amounts of future proof connectors braided cables except for the pcie51 and a bunch of awesome accessories check out the dark Power Pro 13 using the link in the video description [Music] thank you now I'm not sure what concerns me more how Amazon actually managed to fit all of that stuff into this box or if any of it's okay look at these gashes on this side of the box it's like multi-box deep gashes in here there's another pretty wild gash on the side here and then on the bottom we've got this bad boy look at that but I guess having a no T-Rex delivery policy would technically be discrimination I think they actually did match the film in here now the smarty pants amongst you may have already guessed what this gaming system in here is based on because of the Amazon refurb stickers on here but there's a whole lot more to it than that it even comes with an RGB remote we get some Hi-Fi headphones in a box that has also had the T-Rex treatment [Music] oh yeah that's the sound of quality these kind of look a bit like Dollar Store Beats headphones and they're even Wireless which is real fancy I'm guessing that's why we got two Bluetooth dongles in the Box considering they're a headset I'm assuming there's a terrible microphone in them but anyway we'll try out the headset a bit later let's see what else we got in the Box and then here we have our bomb Mouse brand is the headset but this is a lot more out there looking than the headset it kind of looks like it was designed by a 13 year old hopped up on Slurpees it's surprisingly comfortable Mouse clicks are decent although that scroll wheel feels like a damp handshake and we don't have any like additional Mouse buttons on it which is a bit of a shame for a gaming mouse now to get to the keyboard and the monitor under here we are gonna have to remove the PC first so let's do that oh it's so tiny oh and I'm assuming the boom keyboard is by the same brand [Music] it is and it just looks like keyboard and it just feels and sounds like a cheap membrane keyboard nothing fancy but perfectly serviceable yeah the combination of the keyboard and the mouse does feel a bit mismatched I'm not gonna lie but I'm sure it has some gamer RGB to make up for it we'll see now have a look at the monitor that seems to have had its lung punctured when we actually set up the gaming setup but first let's have a look at the PC [Music] foreign [Music] these Dell Optiplex gaming systems just keep getting more ridiculous this one apparently having been dug out of a stripper's purse the seller just glued a bunch of glittery sandpaper to the outside of it and didn't even do a great job of it it's just like bits of glue and crap sticking out all over the place there's scuff marks on the top although in all fairness considering my track record of this kind of crap I don't think I get to throw shade here now I don't really know what specs are in here because the seller is quite vague about it but I'm assuming considering the price that we've got an 800 year old I5 in here and maybe a gt710 if we're lucky now this Optiplex model is so old it doesn't even have USB 3 on the back but at least it makes up for it with a lot of USB 2 ports we've also got a Mesozoic period port on the back which we're not going to use because we're going to be plugging into whatever monster this is which I'm gonna try and upgrade later in the video to see what kind of Maximum gaming performance we can get from it but before we get to that point let's open it up and have a closer look [Music] ah Good Old thousand-year-old Dell interior we've got a blower fan over the CPU heatsink which is probably covering like an i5 2400 judging by the generation of this Dell now I don't know what kind of ram configuration we have in here because I can't see it I actually think the ram is like down here somewhere so we'll only figure out what Ram we have in here once we turn the system on interestingly the graphics card actually isn't a gt710 like I was anticipating it to be no this has a GTX 750 Ti in it a much more powerful graphics card I'm so excited to see this Crush games we also get a king fast SSD which will help a lot for General system responsiveness compared to the hard drives you often get with this kind of system we also have RGB in it so they have like an RGB Hub in here so I'm assuming they've added like lighting to the front and stuff which again we'll see once we turn the system on now unfortunately we only have a 240 watt power supply in here which is proprietary but I think the graphics card we made drop in here later to upgrade this is gonna be fine without power supply it should be I hope it'll fit in here uh but we'll see we'll see uh so with that let's close it up and set up our entire gaming system and then do some gaming on it [Music] considering the puncture wound on the box I've got a terrified to see the state of this monitor I guess it looks fine in there okay good there's no obvious damage to the panel oh yeah that's some a-grade IO [Music] and the rest of it lights up nicely as well we've got the keyboards RGB here which is quite dim but I think the mouse more than makes up for it it looks gamery as hell I don't think you can control the RGB it just kind of goes through the rainbow vomit cycle the more astute of you would have noticed the setup didn't come with a mouse pad so we're gonna have to bear back the table which kind of sucks the headset is pretty uncomfortable because it's like on-ear as opposed to over ear and I really don't like that it just puts pressure on your ears in ways that it shouldn't my favorite by far still is this RGB stripper personal I just love this kind of thing so much it's kind of like putting under glow in a body kit on a 1994 Camry you know yeah it's gamer here I guess but it's still just look stupid this monitor has a really interesting finish on it because it's like very glossy plastic which is something that I've not seen on a display in a long time it looks pretty wild I'm curious to see how much RAM we've got in here if it's more than eight gigs I'll be very surprised and i7 2600 so we actually have a more powerful CPU than I was expecting and we've got 16 gigs of RAM two sticks what more could you want so this is an unprecedented Hardware configuration for one of these because we also have a GTX 750 Ti in here this is this is amazing whoa what are these Auto settings why is it capping our frame rate and that doesn't make any sense I then changed all the settings to 1080p competitive and loaded into a round of everybody's favorite digital daycare first off in terms of peripherals the lack of mouse pad isn't great but the mouse and keyboard feel pretty inoffensive besides that which is something I really can't say for the monitor which just looks terrible the colors are wildly wrong and the off-angle viewing the surrenders this is one of the worst monitors I've seen in a while I can't wait to measure it actually I think it's going to be hilarious other than that though the gaming performance is way better than what I'm used to from this kind of system it's actually playable we even have a better CPU Headroom left for a future graphics card upgrade which will likely catch on fire the setup was so usable in fact I was winning a whole lot of PVP although it may not have been because of the gaming setup I don't know that person has to be playing with no sound [Music] I've killed six players and I don't think I've been hit once this is clearly like baby's first fortnite round oh no regardless of the reason the Amazon gaming setup eventually led me to Victory hey look at that CS go is also running very well this is a 1080p competitive settings and it feels good like this is a usable CS go experience I just wish the monitor was less of an Abomination like it's so bad horrendous Monitor and headset aside when it comes to Esports titles this system is genuinely usable which is not something you can always say for these cheap Resto mod systems but what about something a bit more demanding even Battlefield 5 is kind of okay uh we're just under 60 frames per second and the thing is this is not the same almost 60 frames per second as we were getting in fortnite it feels the heavier and worse let's try out the render scale option to squeeze out a bit more performance doesn't look amazing but it feels a lot better we didn't gain a lot in terms of frame rate but when it comes to like input lag and how the game feels it's made a big difference ooh it seems like cyberpunk is where we kind of run out of steam uh now granted this is at 1080P and it is medium settings so the fact that the PC hasn't exploded yet under it is quite impressive but this is not playable there is so much input lag hopefully balanced Fidelity effects can save us it's a lot better like a lot better but it's still not great it leaves us no choice Ultra performance hey there we go so with ultra performance FSR at low settings it can actually kind of run we just need to ignore the fact that it looks horrendous like look at that thing in the trail behind the car but then something weird happened wait what's happened why are we what is happening oh oh there we go it's loaded the bit of the game anyway let's drop a more powerful graphics card in here and see it all catch on fire [Music] and this is the GTX 750 Ti that's been putting up a pretty commendable fight but now we're gonna drop in one of the most powerful low profile graphics cards in the world the RTX A2000 a graphics card is actually featured in the last video so I'm really getting my money's worth out of this card [Music] there's actually slightly more clearance than I was expecting between the bottom of the graphics card and the top of the quite hard power supply okay well because of how all of the clips line up this doesn't close another problem I ran into was the A2000 only has mini display board connectors on it and the only DisplayPort to HDMI adapter I have goes the wrong way so because of the lack of DisplayPort on the monitor I had to use a different one yeah no it doesn't work I'm gonna have to use this monitor whoa considering that the A2000 cost almost double this entire gaming setup it has barely made a difference so I guess there was just much less CPU Headroom than I was expecting although having said that the CPU utilization is still quite low on a side note because the GPU is not doing much the temperatures are actually very good and in terms of input lag it feels quite a lot better but we're using a different monitor so that doesn't mean much Battlefield 5 initially wouldn't let me Spawn for some reason but once that sorted out why can't I spot oh there we go there we go suddenly spawn happens okay there we go with Battlefield 5 it's made quite a big difference although not nearly as big a difference as you can expect considering the graphics card I think something like an RX 6400 or a GTX 1650 would be a much less stupid upgrade and then for some reason once I installed the A2000 cyberpunk just refused to launch on the system weird and finally I did end up measuring the monitor which went hilariously as expected the monitor has a max brightness of 80 nits which is not only terrible but the monitor reaches that Luminosity at 63 percent and when you increase the brightness setting above that the monitor just seems to crank up the gamma until you get a flat gray image at 100 brightness at 100 brightness this is what the monitor's color accuracy looks like which is by far the worst measurement I've ever gotten for some context the goal here is to get an average of less than two In fairness when you change the brightness to 63 it measures way better but it completely falls about the moment you touch the brightness setting which brings me to the end of the video thank you very much for watching consider watching another video suggest will pop up in a second subscribe and all that and until the next video bye-bye [Music] foreign [Music]",

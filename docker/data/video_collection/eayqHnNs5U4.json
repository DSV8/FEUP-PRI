    "transcript": "- Hey, this is Dan from The Verge. I'm here in Seattle at Amazon's annual product showcase event, where they just announced a ton of new products, like 15 new hardware devices, countless other announcements on stage, but in terms of like the new Echo line, they kind of revamped a bunch of things, introduced some new products, and kind of upgraded some of their existing products. So the big thing to know with the new Echo line is probably the new Echo Studio, which is Amazon's new high-end speaker. This is a $199 speaker, it's the first smart speaker to support 3D audio, which provides a really unique, immersive type of experience. It also supports the Dolby Atmos 3D audio, it also supports standard stereo audio, and it's meant to complement Amazon's new Music HD service, which gives high-res, lossless video tracks that you can stream. So inside the Studio are actually five different drivers. It's got three mid-range drivers at two inches apiece, a tweeter that is a one inch sized tweeter, and then a five and a quarter inch woofer that fires down into this cavity that allows the bass to escape from the speaker itself. Two of the mid-range speakers fire sideways, one of them fires up, which helps, gives it that 3D placement of sound so it can put it in different spots of the room. It's all powered by a 330-watt peak amplifier, and it really puts out a lot of volume. It's surprising how loud and how spacial and engulfing this speaker sounds in such a small compact size. If you want more sound, you can actually pair two of them together in stereo. You can also connect it to your TV and use it as a Dolby Atmos speaker with a Fire TV for home theater stuff. It's really quite a versatile speaker, and it's really interesting that Amazon was able to do that in such a small, compact package, and for this price that they're selling it at. The Echo Studio is really competitive with something like Sonos, or an Apple Home Pod, but at 199 bucks, it's very aggressively priced. We got a demo of it, it sounds really cool, we're eager to hear more of it when we can get it into the real world. Also in the Echo speaker line is a new standard Echo, which is 99 bucks, it's a redesigned version that borrows a lot of the things from the Echo Plus last year. So you've got a fabric design on the outside, it's got a louder, more powerful speaker system so it sounds a whole lot better, but it's pretty much a basic Echo. They've gone away with the wooden shells and things like that, are going full on fabric, and it looks basically just like the Echo Plus, but it doesn't have the Zigbee home hub inside of it, so it's got one fewer feature, but it's only 99 bucks, so it's a really inexpensive, entry-level product on the Echo speaker. Also new is the Echo Dot Clock, which is an Echo Dot with a clock in it. It's basically like if you had a Echo Dot that had a LED display on the front, shows you the time, you can use it as a smart alarm clock, you can just smack the top of the thing to silence the alarm, it's pretty cool, it's pretty convenient, especially if you want a smart alarm clock, but you don't want a screen, and you don't want a camera in your bedroom, the Echo Dot Clock is a pretty clever little product. Now outside of the speaker lineup, there are some new products in the Echo brand. There's the Echo Glow, which is a light that's basically this glowing orb. You can sync it up with an Echo, and then when you play music, it'll flash lights in syncopation with the music, you could tell it to cycle through various lights, you can make it look like a fireplace, like a flickering candle kind of vibe, or you can just kind of tap the top of it. It's 25 bucks, it's pretty neat, but it's kind of also a one-trick pony. I don't know, we'll see how popular that is. Also new is the Echo Show 8, which is a mid-size Echo Show. So we already have the Echo Show, which is a ten inch screen smart display from Amazon. It's got a big screen, loud speakers. They came out with the Echo Show 5 earlier this year, which is a smaller smart display, and now they have the Echo Show 8, which sits right in the middle. It brings a lot of the things from the Echo Show 10, or Echo Show, ten inch model, down, with like the louder speakers, better sound quality, a bigger, brighter screen, but it carries over some of the design features of the Echo Show 5, including the ability to use a shutter to block the camera. The most attractive thing about this, though, is probably its price. It's 129 bucks, which is $100 less than an Echo Show. That's a really aggressive price point, it's a little bit smaller, maybe you could put it in a few more places than the big Echo Show, but it'll be interesting to see how good that performs in the real world, as well. Finally, there's the brand new Echo Flex. Now this is a kind of unique product. What it is is basically a small Echo speaker that plugs directly into a wall outlet. It's not really designed to be a primary music speaker, even though you could use it to listen to music, but it's really meant to give you an access point to Alexa in any room in your house really inexpensively, and without having to run a wire or put a speaker in there. On the bottom of it, it's got a USB port, so you can charge your phone off of it, and then you can also attach new add-on modules, and they're coming out with two add-ons right away, with a motion sensor, or a night light, so you can add things to that as you need. It's really inexpensive, the Echo Flex is only $24.99, the add-on modules are only $14.99, so it's a really cheap way to put Alexa in basically every room of your house. So that should cover basically everything we've seen here at Amazon today.

    "description": "Review of the Lenovo Legion Y530 - The best gaming laptop from Lenovo under $1000. Legion Y530 -   With thin bezels and good build quality, Lenovo has heavily improved their Legion laptop this year. It's less expensive than the Legion Y570 but retains the performance. This is the cheapest gaming laptop I've seen with thin bezels like this. Configurable with a GTX 1050 Ti and 8th gen Intel processors, performance is very respectable for current titles.

    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going Dave 2D here? So we've seen a lot of gaming laptops on this channel big ones little ones expensive ones less expensive ones but usually they fall into two kind of main categories cheaper ones that are bigger thicker less nice-looking and More expensive ones that look better but that price tag is invariably higher. This is the lgion Y530 from Lenovo and its main strength is the design. It's one of the best looking devices You're going to get for this kind of money at least for a gaming laptop So the big draw the big thing that makes it special is the bezel on the screen It's very thin and it reminds me of much more expensive laptops So the XPS 15 was probably one of the first 15-inch laptops use a thin bezel like this but a lot of the gaming laptops nowadays are Whatever there's a lot more going outside a lot of gaming laptops These days are going with bigger screens with thin bezels, and it looks nice So the main advantage of having a thin bezel isn't just for the fact that it's a thin bezel device, right? Obviously, it looks good, but it also makes the whole device smaller right when you have less bezel That means the footprint of the whole device is smaller. So it's just a more portable and more compact device And this looks really good The design of this thing on the exterior is a much more muted look than we traditionally see from Lenovo Lenovo was like one of the bigger companies with like the red and black thing going on. They just loved that They played it out for several years. This is all black this year Not a single drop of red not even red LED if I'm not mistaken Yeah, there isn't even a red LED the only lighting you'll have up front. Is this little light on the lgion logo? Which lights up when the laptop is on? It's a simple white light You can't change any of the RGB or anything is just white and I think it looks good the top surface Is this kind of textured plastic? It's basically a radial pattern that originates from the O from the lgion and it just spreads out It's a pretty durable finish up top I thought I might scuff easily because of that texture but took some keys to it tried to scratch a little bit Stay solid the build quality in here. It feels good. It's not amazing or anything. It is a predominantly plastic laptop I wouldn't say that it's bad like nothing kind of strikes me as being Like an issue or anything like that? I like the hinge that they're using some of the older lenovo laptops had a really bad hinge design This is a good one. And it feels like it just feels well-made I'm surprised that they changed the design of this laptop. So drastically from the previous year like this looks nothing like the original Lenovo y series gaming laptop. So it looks completely different and I like it It's just improved across the board the other thing and you'll see that I'm doing this in the video I'm pulling the screen all the way back repeatedly and it just the screen go all the way flat and they're able to do this because We'll the hinge design for one but if you'll notice the back of the laptop extends a little bit beyond the Base of the screen and it's a design element that usually helps with improving the thermals on a laptop The ports are on the back of the device at least most of them There's still an audio jack and a usb on each side But the main cluster of ports is on the back and I really like that It's obviously a personal preference But I like to have all of my connections like the AC adapter and he's like the USB C or Ethernet I like it when it's on the back of the device just out of the way and This allows you to do that. I don't like how the usb C isn't Thunderbolt 3 capable It's kind of expected at this price point but still disappointing inside the device We're looking at a keyboard deck that has a soft touch material everywhere I've talked about this in my previous videos, but it's a nice material at first But I've always worried about long term use this stuff can get gunky now That being said I have seen brands like I have seen products where the soft touch material has held up over time But it's not something that I can tell based on just a short experience like this The keyboard itself is good and I like how they've done the layout So on a traditional laptop, you're either gonna have a spacious keyboard That doesn't have a number pad or a cramped keyboard with a number-pad, but they've done something quite different They have their regular layout and it's spacious, but their number pad is actually above the arrow keys So they've actually made a really good use of this It's a different layout than a lot of other keyboards, but I think you'll get used to it The only concern is that if you're someone that uses a number pad a lot This is a different kind of like your muscle-memory will be different on this number pad than the traditional number pad Trackpad a great trackpad. It's got hardware buttons like dedicated Hardware buttons, which is not common these days I like them Windows precision great tracking. The only thing I have to complain about is that the button mechanism is quite loud Alright let's talk about the speakers they sound good and they're positioned Well, they're in this kind of tucked beveled area up front. The base isn't great. Like the lower frequencies just aren't represented Well in this device, I don't expect it considering the price and considering the fact that it's a laptop But if you want a bass, it's not really there. Okay to get inside this laptop It's relatively easy. You do have to struggle with the tabs a little bit on the bottom It's just a bunch of screws and they come off easily But you just got to be careful opening it because there are plastic tabs that hold it in place Once you're inside you have access to everything you have your Wi-Fi card. You can swap out your two RAM slots There's two Drive slots. There's an nvme and there's two and a half inch SATA. You also have access to your battery It's a fifty two and a half watt hour battery. It's not particularly large it's actually relatively small and battery life on this thing is only four hours a little bit more than four hours and That's with screen at 250 nits. so yeah a lot of devices like this are gonna have shorter battery lives, but this is actually one of the shorter ones. That's what you get four hour battery You're gonna have to bring your AC adapter If you don't bring this thing to class or whatever cuz you're not gonna go through a day on four hours of battery life Okay last thing the screen This is the money the design of the screen is seriously the best part of this laptop and it makes it look like a much More expensive device than it actually is. It's reasonably color accurate It's definitely good enough for games, but I wish it was brighter If you're playing in a more lit environment, it might be difficult to use this screen The webcams down on the bottom underneath the screen and well, it's a nose cam This device comes in a few configurations you get a gtx 1050 or a 1050 TI This one's a 1050 TI and the performance is good But you're not gonna get anything mind-blowing you're gonna be able to play most Triple A games near 60 frames per second But you're gonna have to play with that graphics quality slider a bit The thermals on this device are good. It doesn't throttle and the fans aren't super loud even on max load It's not crazy loud or anything. I do like that there are software control of the fans so if you want to you can put on the maximum fan mode and just let it rip and I'm really happy that lenovo was able to make something that looks like this in A thermally appropriate chassis like that's not easy I think a lot of companies try and just don't have great thermals and don't really care about it But they did a good job now. It's not a particularly powerful card it is a 1050 TI I would have really liked to have seen a 1060 or at least a 1060 max Q because I feel like The chassis could handle it The thermals are good enough is just they don't offer that option and it just doesn't make sense to me Especially because there's a 144 Hertz screen option Like they have a high refresh screen available, but a not a particularly powerful GPU available So that that that combination doesn't really work for me maybe in the future. They'll add more powerful GPU options other things I don't like the screen i wish it was brighter but at this price point it's tough to get a really bright screen and the third thing is the battery life a Four hour battery life. Like I mentioned isn't a full day battery. So yeah. Those are the only real negatives about this whole product I like it a lot. They've done a good job with it Again, the big thing about this thing though is the design. It's thinner than your average $950 gaming laptop and I think on sale this is gonna be even cheaper like during Black Friday or like the end of the summer I could see this thing going to like 850 or like 900 so Yeah, overall great device. I think lenovo really knocked this one out of the park It's rare for a company to make something that looks this good at this price point. Okay. Hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it. I'll see you guys next time You",

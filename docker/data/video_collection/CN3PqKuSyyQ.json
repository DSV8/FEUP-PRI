    "transcript": "- Matt, you can't say that on camera. (bleep) - Hello and welcome to This Is We got the '90s vibes today 'cause we're gonna be talking about something very dear to many of your hearts, not specifically mine, but game preservation. - You care about the games you need to save the games Matt. You're directly putting games into the landfill with the other E.T. cartridges and I won't stand for it. Game preservation, especially as digital games have become so much more prevalent has become more and more of a topic, especially as we get farther away from those physical titles, as things start to collapse and crumble, as collectors bid up the price of that copy of Pokemon Black 2 to $300 a copy because I can't play it anywhere else and they don't wanna reprint it and I'm really sad about that. There's a real conversation I think, to be had especially there's companies like Sony and Nintendo keep flipping off their online stores literally and physically. We've gotta talk about it. - Yeah, and let me be clear where I say I'm very for digital games. I know a lot of people love to have their collections. We hear that constantly, and I don't wanna take that away from anyone. I do agree that it's not a good system right now for digital, but I mean, I love having my entire library at my fingertips at any given moment. So I am all for the all digital future. I do agree that companies are really [censored] us. - Wow! Strong language - I was trying to think of another way to word- they are, like you said, with PlayStation the way they've just been switching off the PS3 store, you know one of my favorite games of all time, - Ape Escape - Ape escape. I knew it - Yeah, I love Ape Escape. Right now, the only way to play it is on a, you know, a physical disc. It is coming to their streaming service. I get why a lot of people don't like that because you know you don't own it, as soon as it's not on the platform anymore, it's gone. I get that that sucks. I agree with you. I wish companies would do a better job with these things, but I don't care about going out and buying Pokemon Black physical because one, like you say the prices skyrocketing and that's because of Sony and Nintendo are doing all these- are not preserving their games. - Bunch of stuff to dive in here. Are you trying? What're you looking at? Are you looking at my Coke Coffee? - I was- - Would you like a sip, Matt? You sound a little thirsty. - Can't help, but notice. Huh? Have I just exposed Austin Evans. Here, look, look, he's gonna shill something that he's not even drinking himself. - I have some more (indistinct) - Notice that my Red Bull is open and (slurps) - Some companies do digital games right? Valve, I think is absolutely case in point number one for me because while no, not every single Steam game forever is listed on the steam platform. The games that have fallen off steam are most entirely not Valve's fault, right? So, you know, maybe through music licensing where they couldn't continue to sell whatever, but at least if you buy something on steam I have an enormous amount of confidence that is going to be in my library basically forever. That is the sort of gold standard. And I think a big reason why Steam and the PC has really kind of given up on physical games a long time ago. Whereas consoles are still stuck in that sort of mid ground where they still have hybrids of the physical and the digital. Another company who I think does pretty good is Microsoft right? On a Series S or a specialization series X you can throw in a disc for pretty much any Xbox One game, a lot of 360 games, and a decent amount of original Xbox games. If I wanna go down to Goodwill and pick up a $3 copy of Tony Hawk, I can throw it in my Xbox and odds are, it's just gonna work. And I think that is an incredibly noble thing that they're doing. It's not like they're just doing it because they wanna, you know, be the good guys. I mean, obviously they are selling consoles because people wanna play their old stuff right? But then we look at some other companies who are not doing it as well. Sony, I think very famously over the last year or so has gotten into a lot of hot water. They shut off the PSP store, they're in the process of sun setting, both the PS3 as well as the Vita. If you load up a PS3 right now, and you try to go download some games you're gonna be finding that it's a very, very limited selection. Almost the more egregious one to me, is what Nintendo is doing. Nintendo Online services and downloadable games are the actual worst. Oh my God. Not only that. Nintendo spend half their time, not preserving their games but taking down like emulator sites or fan projects or whatever, like the worst. - I'm trying not to get really heated about this. - Oh, no, get heated. It's time to get heated - Because I have such strong opinions. Nintendo every year re-releases Super Mario the exact same [censored] way. I'm not talking about updates like, oh we need DLC. I mean, [censored] that would make it run right. A single person modded to have HD textures on Mario 64 and then they sued him to take it down. Super Mario Brother's been released for 30 something years. And they haven't changed a goddamn thing about it This should be 99. - Okay. Okay. Well, hold on hold. I don't totally agree with you on that right. Nintendo are a hundred percent my biggest issue when it comes to the game preservation aspect of things right So first of all, Nintendo Online services suck. Nintendo Online is a shell of what it could be compared to something like PSN or Xbox Live. On top of that, they're currently in the process of shutting down the Wii U and the 3DS shop. The 3DS was on sale like what? A year and a half, two years ago. Like they just discontinued it and they're already shutting it off. You can still get on with an Xbox 360. You can still go and download a lot of games. That came out in 2005, right? The 3DS and the Wii U came out years and years after that with a far less robust service, and they're already shutting it down. Now, yes, I would love if all companies approached it with the Steam model of, Hey, you know what? We're just gonna have this online marketplace and different consoles can hop on. Like Microsoft are kind of doing something somewhat similar right now because like the Xbox One and the Series X kinda share a similar kind of store and what not. - I can't believe I'm about to say this. and I'm gonna regret this so much. - Okay. I'm excited. - But to me, like, this is the good use of the blockchain. - What? - You buy a game. - Yeah? - And instead of having a cryptocurrency, whatever - Sure - You have your game on like a wallet. Instead of a crypto wallet, like the physical USB drive. - Right, right, right. - Your game is on that, regardless of what, whether the store is selling it or whatever if it's on there, it's your, you know tangible authentication for these things. This is where like ethical, piracy comes up. The games I am nostalgia for and want to go back and play, I can very easily get my hands on emulator wise. But I know I'm gonna get flack for this one as well. But like right now, one of the best places to play, some of these vintage games is on the Apple store. So like, I'm typically pretty anti-piracy. But when it comes to these games of like I wanna give you money. - I agree. - But if you don't wanna let me give you money. In a reasonable way, and the keyword there is reasonable. I do not think it's reasonable that Nintendo comes out and says we're gonna intentionally make a scarcity of Super Mario, just so we can sell you a single use piece of hardware like the play and watch every few years - the Game & Watch. - Yeah, sorry, the Game & Watch See, I don't even care. I don't care, I don't care (laughter) Like you're just paid $50 for Super Mario that you're gonna play like twice. - I'm sure most everyone watching this video knows that I am a big collector of Pokemon stuff. I don't know if you could tell, I don't know what gave it away between Pokemon cards, between the games, between the specialization consoles. Like that's one of the things that is really a big passion of mine is collecting a lot of this stuff. And I love the fact that I can go rip a pack of cards right before we shoot a video, find something really good, send it in to get slabbed up, to get graded by someone like PSA or CGC. There you go, the cards that we opened right before I started shooting this video, and I can have that preserved, I can sell it, I can buy it, I can trade it. But it's something that I have that I really really enjoy In video gaming there is an analog to this, which is grading companies, and the collectible market for games. Most people when it's actually something really rare and still sealed and all that kind of stuff are buying it as a collector. Are you familiar with Heritage Auctions and Wata Games? - Only by reputation, I don't know the full story. - So, Karl Jobst, shout out to Karl Jobst, He is one of the handful, I'd say five or six YouTubers who if he drops a video, boom I'm a hundred percent watching it all the way through. He's done a series of videos on the whole saga. So basically Wata Games is a game grading company. You ship your copy of a game in, they take a look at it, make sure it's authentic. They will give it a numbered grade. And that will then say, okay, look this is a real authentic copy. And it is completely slabbed up and sealed so that it's sort of preserved so that I could look up the value of what a 9.6 sold for boom, easy. They have been embroiled actually in a lawsuit that just actually hit where Heritage Auction and Wata Games were essentially colluding, theoretically, supposedly, that they were buying games, grading it the companies were kinda like in bed with each other with like the founders and what not, giving it to Wata to grade, turning around and auctioning it off. Then the owners were buying those games or buying parts of the games to bid up the prices. Heritage Auctions sold a copy, a graded copy of the super Mario cartridge for a $100,000. 10 days later, it sold for 3.21 million. And this has been a trend, right? Because especially with collectibles, there's been a big sort of bubble, which is sort of deflating a little bit now, stuff that was worth $20-$30,000 a few years ago is now worth hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars according to this. And again, if you, as a collector, see a thing, sell for a million dollars, you go, oh, you know what that's what it's selling for. Cause that's the way all this stuff works in this sort of day and time where people want to play games that they grew up with, that they're nostalgic for. If you can download it easily. Great. Awesome. If you got your old copy of Pokemon Green or Blue or whatever, hanging around. Awesome. Sweet. If you want to get into this kind of stuff, it is a ridiculous world of scams, of overpaying. or having to go through some super sketchy backdoor Torrance site because Nintendo shut down everything remotely reasonable to actually get your hands on. It is absolutely crazy. I want everyone for digital games. Make a damn, universal store and let me download the games I've bought, forever or at least a very long time. - And that's what I want to come back to on my approach it's just, it should be like the Sony store not the PS3 store, not the PS4 store - The Sony store, the place that you store. Like I think it's clear that there's like a collectible side of things, which is fueling the physical game prices to be out of reach for the vast majority of gamers. And then on the other side, you've got weird hardware that Nintendo was sold in the past and what not and things like the PS3, which are difficult to emulate and these online services and these storefronts that are being shut down where it's quickly becoming if you wanna play that game, you might only be able to legally do that by spending hundreds of dollars in some obscure piece of physical hardware or you download it off of some particular website online, I would never tell you to do that - You go to www.[Censored] - Matt. You can't say that on camera. - What you do is you click download now, you unzip it, and then we'll [censored] - So my friends, are you ready to join the glorious digital age of no physical collectibles and downloading every game ever for free 99? Or do you think that this is actually an incredibly important thing and that Matt should stop scalping my copy of Pokemon Black 2 via sketchy auction sites and bidding up the price so I can't play, because I miss playing that fifth gen. Let us know in the comments below. Make sure to subscribe and Ringaling that dingaling button so you're always kept up to date with Austin and Matt's wacky hi jinks. And until next time, Matt, can you play us out with a song? We haven't done this in a long time. (obscurely sings Super Mario theme) - We just got sued - Video has now been taken offline. - I think that was far enough away from anything that Mario has ever done that we're not gonna get sued.",

    "transcript": "- No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You cannot build an entire gaming PC that is the size of a PS Vita. Look at this thing. To say that it borrows from the Vita would be a gross understatement. It borrowed, and then, (Linus coughs), it borrowed some more and then it borrowed some more. It's three Vitas thick. But the GPD Win Four may just be the most handle-able, the most console-like of the next gen handheld PCs. Did this joystick cover just fall off? Okay, it's an early unit, all right? They've still got some kinkles to wrinkle out. One moment, please. This thing is wild. We're talking a Ryzen 7 6800U, so that's Zen3+ with RDNA2 graphics, 16 to 32 gigs of LPDDR5 memory, up to two terabytes of internal NVME storage and among the best ergonomic experiences that I've seen to date. Oh, and did I mention it's got USB4, with GPD actually advertising EGPU compatibility? Wait, you could hook an external graphics card up to this? Okay, let's see what they've got for accessories. (Linus humming) - [Bell] 65 watts. - 65 watts. I was gonna get there. I'm sitting here, I'm sitting here doing the math for how many watts this is, volts times amp. It says right here, 65 watt charger. Type C to type C, so we've got a type C cable, but that is not the main event. Oh, wow. Man, I'm liking the size. Now obviously, it doesn't have the same kind of screen size that you've got on something like a Steam Deck, right? Where you've got that massive seven inch display. Obviously, that's a bit of a smaller screen, but it's very handle-able. Wow, I am liking this. By default, they've got a joy to mouse application installed that uses the right joystick to, there we go, move the mouse cursor around. You can use your shoulder buttons to left and right click. Actually, let's take a look at all the different buttons. So you got your A, B, X, Y here, and conveniently, GPD, they have no idea you're gonna use this for PlayStation emulation, they wouldn't think of it, has gone and put the square, circle, X and triangle legends in little tiny printing on the A, B, X, Y. Two joysticks that I would describe as somewhere in between a mobile only joystick like you'd find on something like the Switch and the full fat joysticks that you'd find on something like a Steam Deck. They definitely have some work to do on making sure that the tops of them don't pop off, but they're feeling pretty good. Are these Hall Effect? Hold on, hold on. I'm gonna guess. I'm saying no. - [Bell] They are not. - They are not. - [Bell] Alps 3D. - Alps 3D, so not Hall Effect. Ooh, I am really liking this D pad. Also, by going with the lower profile joysticks, they make it quite a bit easier to access your A, B, X, Y without accidentally bumping the joysticks. That's something that I have run into on other handhelds. They've got shoulder, trigger. Oh yeah, look at that. They've got L and R three as well. So they've got these back mounted buttons here. You've got your volume up, volume down on the top, power button. Is this RGB lighting in the shoulders? Okay, things are getting pretty cool. USB4 type C connector up here. To be clear, USB4 is not the same thing as Thunderbolt and it takes quite a bit of firmware work on the part of the system maker to ensure that you will actually have compatibility with Thunderbolt accessories, so your mileage may vary on that. But we've also got USB-A, headphone jack. Kicking some hot air out of there already. What's the TDP of this bad boy? 22 watts, I'm guessing? According to Motion Assistant, the shipping TDP is 28 watts, but it can be adjusted anywhere from five to 35 watts. There's a large intake at the back where we can see the fan for the cooling system, and then at the bottom, I love to see this, another type C port. This enables you to either have the cable coming off the bottom while you're playing and charging or coming off the top while you're playing and charging, depending on what works better for you in the particular situation you are in. I'm also assuming that these are gonna be your start and select or whatever that's called on... Wait, hold on. It not only has a fingerprint scanner for signing into Windows, it has a one of those optical mouse things? Okay, that's pretty cool. Also, because of the screen size, you can actually tap with your thumb pretty easily. On the left, we've got a microSD slot, and there it is, the slider for mouse mode versus game pad mode. So we're gonna wanna flip that over when we're in a game so that it actually works as typically an XInput game controller device. I actually really like GPD's approach to this, compared to INEO has their iSpace application, that theoretically detects when you launch a game and just like switches automatically. In practice, it's not always perfect. Whereas this way, I can tell it, \"Look, I wanna play a game now.\" It's six inches, 1080p, which means this thing is crazy sharp, uses Gorilla Glass 5 and, this is really cool, it is a native landscape display, which might not sound like a big deal to you, but in practice, it dramatically reduces the amount of random dinking around that you have to do when a game detects the default resolution of your display and shows up sideways. Running your display always rotated 90 degrees does cause some problems in Windows. This is not that bright. No, I didn't crank it, but it's really not that bright. Is it OLED or something? Is that what I'm dealing with here? - [Bell] It is IPS. - It's IPS, okay. Does this thing, oh yeah, this thing, oh, that's really nice. This thing still works even when you're in controller mode, so you still have a mouse. That's pretty cool. I mean, it's not the greatest thing ever, but it's a lot better than not having it. There you go. Hey, nice. These joysticks feel not bad, for not good joysticks. I just wanna see Hall Effects joysticks on everything now. Ever since that GuiliKit controller came through here, I'm like, \"Oh yeah\". And the upgraded Steam Deck, I'm like, \"Oh yeah, it's good.\" It's getting a little loud. It's got a little bit of that whine to it. Not much, very little. Front facing speakers though. Pretty hopeful about those. (ambient video game sounds) Shut up. Okay, you got my attention, GPD. Wait, I haven't even shown you guys the best gimmick. There's a full keyboard in this thing. You know what? It's kind of awesome for the ergonomics too. Okay, I should turn this down a bit. I'm at 1080p, all high, playing this at 45 to 50 frames per second. This is absolutely objectively ridiculous. GPD is really showing their experience in this space here. Oh yeah, it's got rumble. I'd like to see the display improve for release. The contrast is not amazing. Hmm, I don't know, am I being unfair to the display? I mean, it's not OLED obviously 'cause it's not. Okay, the haptics on this thing are kind of pretty good. Okay, all right, all right. I'm paying attention, just like I'm paying attention to this message from our sponsor. Manscaped's performance package 4.0 kit is designed to contain everything you need to make grooming below the waist easy. It includes the updated Lawnmower 4.0 with wireless charging, their Weed Whacker nose trimmer for the tricky areas, plus some other goodies like their Crop Preserver and Crop Reviver sprays for deodorizing and toning. Get 20% off plus free international shipping using the link in the description down below. Get it, down below 'cause it's down below and it's for down below? Get it, get it, Manscaped? Anyway, I can't believe this game is running at 50 to 60 frames per second, on high. Are the, is the trigger sensitivity adjustable? They're very sensitive out of the box. I can't believe I forgot about the keyboard. Oh man, that is so nice. Just being able to be like, \"You know what? \"I don't want this game open anymore. \"Alt, F4\", just like that. Look at this thing. Is this freaking sick or what? - Man, is it like a Rumour? - It's like the Vita, except if the Vita was chadded out grandpa, you know? - I don't know, I think it's much more like a chadded out Rumour. - What the devil's a Rumour? - The LG Rumour. - I thought that was just a rumor. - We'll ignore that. - Oh, I mean, so, okay. It's kind of like that in that it does have a slide out keyboard. Oh, it borrows so much more from the Vita though. - It borrows the most important bit from the Rumour. - All right, thanks Alex. That was really helpful. Oh, shut up. The keyboard is back lit? What does this thing not do? Oh, it is, it's totally back lit! Okay, that's amazing. Okay, let's fire up Motion Assistant here. It also has a six axis gyroscope, so you can aim like this or at least make fine adjustments, so I'm gonna fire up \"Shadow of the Tom Raider\", we'll try and use it. Touch the screen. You can use this, you can use the joystick and you can just tilt it around. Absolutely wild. I actually kind of like the ergonomics of just having the screen up even when I'm not using the keyboard. It just, it puts it in a bit of a nicer spot, you know? Not bad. They've done stuff like this before. This has got to be the most elegant one they've done though. Ooh, I like that. I do wish there was a little more screen and a little less bezzle. Since we're waiting around for this, let's talk about the hardware in here a little bit. If you're not familiar with the 6800U, it's a relatively new APU from AMD that uses the same RDNA2 architecture for its graphics as the Steam Deck, but is actually a much fatter implementation of it, with 12 compute units versus eight. So you can expect games to run quite a bit better, even if all other things were equal, but they're not. It also uses Zen3+ CPU core, as compared to the Steam Deck's Zen2 CPU core, so you may actually be able to run games at 1080p on this like you would run games at 720p on this guy. Of course, it's coming in at a significantly higher price. (Linus clears throat) Yep, it starts higher than a top tier Steam Deck at $800, but it is significantly more powerful. It does have the built-in keyboard, making it very versatile. 1% lows of around 40 FPS. That is very, very playable. We've talked about performance, but that performance does come with a cost. It needs a 45 watt hour battery, compared to the about 40 watt hour battery in the Steam Deck to achieve similar results. So you can expect somewhere in the neighborhood of two hours of battery life if you're running intensive games like this. Not a ton, but of course, you'll be able to stretch it to six, eight, maybe even 10 hours if you're streaming games or massively down clocking the APU. It's also a bit on the heavier side. It's over a pound, about 600 grams and it kind of feels heavier than it is, just 'cause it's so dense. But then, it's also very handle-able, because it's so small and it's nicely rounded. I think that the shoulders are a little bit sensitive for my liking, but I actually quite like the triggers. A, B, X, Y feel good. Man, that D pad feels good. It supports Wi-Fi 6 and has support for what they're calling the Smart Dock, which adds three USB-A ports, a USB C port, an HDMI 2.1 port and gigabit ethernet. So that would be a competitor to something like the Steam Dock. Since it's Windows, of course, the desktop experience will be exactly like what you would expect from a Windows PC running an AMD, CPU and GPU, so I would expect it to be a pretty seamless experience. I cannot believe how well games like this are running on here. Have I played around with 6800U yet? I don't think so. This thing is freaking powerful, man. 30 FPS 1% lows. Oh, that's smooth. That's not 30 FPS average. That's 30 FPS when it dips to the lowest, slowest frames that it's generating. The speakers are loud, but they could stand to be a little bit better balanced too. I hope that's something that they can fine tune as they make their way to release. It's on Indiegogo right now and normally we wouldn't really talk about Kickstarter or Indiegogo type products, but GPD has a pretty good track record for actually delivering what they say they're gonna deliver, and I'd like to see them tune the speakers a little bit between now and then. They're very audible though, they're loud. - Hey fellas, how you doing? - One thing GPD has done well in the past is make their devices pretty easy to open and change out hardware if you really want to. I mean, obviously, these are very tightly integrated devices so don't expect to be upgrading your CPU or your GPU or anything like that, but I would expect to be able to upgrade storage, for example. There we go. There's a look at the internals. Look at this unit of a battery, all right? This thing's more battery than it is computer. That is amazing. They do have the intake right over the battery though to help keep that pack cool. Oh, very nice. 80 millimeter long SSD? So you could pack, wow, you could pack a four, maybe even an eight terabyte SSD into this thing if you really wanted to. That's wild. Intel Wi-Fi, love to see that. AX 1200. Man, that's incredibly compact, isn't it? I'm playing \"Cyberpunk\" on a handheld at 1080p. Not even low settings or anything, guys. This is outstanding. Yeah, it doesn't run as well as \"Shadow the Tomb Raider\" or whatever, and we need some FSR hackery in order to make this work. Okay, 20 FPS lows, but this is absolutely playable, 100%. It's definitely a little warmer to the touch than I'd like. That's a big advantage of Valve's much larger design, is they were able to take all the heat generating components and keep them well away from where you have your hands. Whereas this is quite warm, particularly here and here. If you're a sweaty gamer, that's gonna be noticeable. But man, it's almost pocket-able, you know what I mean? This thing is cart-able in a way that other handhelds just aren't, man. Other than maybe like, what, INEO Air? That thing's pretty cool too but it doesn't have this kind of performance. Performance like Short Circuit, what a great channel. Watch it and subscribe.",

    "transcript": "What's up guys, Lew here back with another video and today I'm going to explain something to you. I'm going to show you something you may have never seen before... Pringles and Redbull. Okay, I'm joking. These are not what they seem at all! These, my friends, are called diversion safes. These two are representation of a whole series of potential diversion safes that you can get on Amazon. The opportunity to hide something valuable in plain sight. Could be jewelry, could be cash, Some... super high profile secret that we can't talk about here on this video, in the comments section. According to the Chicago Police Department, the average break and enter burglar only spends... seven minutes inside of your house. They're looking through drawers for valuables, they're looking for a safe... They're probably not looking through your Red Bull! You don't have this thing sitting out- No, it lives... in an area where you keep some Red Bull who knows. It lives- uh, somewhere where someone's not going to try to crack it open and I know Now, I know you're asking like: \"Show me something!\" what do you mean it looks like Red Bull? \"What do you mean?\" \"It looks like Redbull!\" Okay... The top... screws off... Boom. *epic explosion* Put whatever you need in there. It weighs the same amount as a Red Bull. Now what would you put in here? As I mentioned and pull a few things over. Some cash. First and foremost: Keep this away from individuals and their... sticky paws. A SIM card, Maybe that's... a very important, secret, phone number, A key to... God knows. A ring. As you can see, this is a very high-class, diamond ring right here. An SD card with important information. Seriously though, you could put some Bitcoin. This is to represent jewlery as well, this is not a very expensive watch, but maybe if you had one. Or a burner phone. That's the phone you don't want anybody to know about. Pringles! Maybe you've got bigger stuff to store. Looks, feels,... Shakes. There's actually Pringles in here as well. If you try to open the... the top and eat them. But, on the bottom, once again, only those who know... Now sure, if you put a few things in here and you... shake this around, you might s-, you might feel that something's a little bit off. Like, you're gonna be like: \"What's going on here?\" So don't leave those out, like for your... for your friends who come over And maybe most importantly, you need to protect something like this: A high-profile treasure map, how to get around the... crocodile... Is that a shark as well? The shark... A relatively friendly-looking gorilla... Maybe you're some kind of... diamond... dealer... And you gotta find a place to put your little tiny diamonds. Well, you could carry around -I dunno- couple o' hundred grand in diamonds right inside this guy. Nobody's gonna be... eyeing you down. You're just a redbull drinker. Now you might be thinking: \"Lew, you just... you just exposed us to the world now!\" You have a safe: people know you're protecting something. The whole concept here is that these things are everywhere. So it would be impossible to assume that there would be anything different about one that you see. Over time you just... become used to seeing these things on tables. That's the idea. Hide it in plain sight.",

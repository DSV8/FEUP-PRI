    "transcript": "- I got to get limber, I got to get loose. - Get loosey goosey. - I gotta get loosey. - Getting loosey goosey. - I got to get loose like an Android update. - There's a cold open for you. Hello and welcome to This is, Austin. Is it time for Android to stop trying to release a new OS every year? - Um, okay. So look, there's been a lot of conversation recently around Android 12. Now on the surface, it actually is a very nice looking update. I think Android 12, I think it is one of the best looking Android versions ever, right? And, under the hood, it's a pretty major upgrade. Which is part of the reason why they're having some choppy times. - Yeah, we got to shout out Marques. He's the one who kind of brought this up. All these updates for it were just kind of- - I'll read you the list. - Yeah. - Straight from MKBHD himself. \"The display constantly drops way below 120Hz. The fingerprint sensor is still slower than the rest. The lock screen auto brightness bug out all the time now and the camera app has started slowing down.\" There has been an update since and yes, that does seem to have fixed a lot of issues, but it doesn't get around the fact that Android 12s roll out this year has been nothing short of a disaster. And it's not really the first time that we've seen these big major OS, that are on yearly updates, - Yeah. - have major issues. - And let's be clear. This is not a review of the Pixel. Like I said, these issues kind of have been fixed in a patch already, but one of the conversations that's been brought up about this is Android trying and failing to roll out these yearly upgrades or updates to OS, - Yeah. - because all right, when you have major issues like this at launch, well then you have to go back and work on fixing those and that's cutting into the development time. - Absolutely. - Now you only have 10 months to develop for the new OS. And you're always kind of playing catch-up. - Yeah. - And the strengths of Android, which is the choice, the fragmentation of, everyone has their own skin, you can kind of customize it to be whatever you want. - Yeah. - All carriers are different. Sometimes that ends up being a weakness. And I think this is a good show of that this is a weakness right now. - Yeah. So for context, Android 12 was announced in May of 2021, pretty much on sort of schedule like they always do, but it came out in October, which was about a month behind. The difference is Android 12 was, like I was saying earlier, a very comprehensive overhaul not only looks wise, but also just underneath the hood on the Pixel. And of course on Android 12 generally. But the first launch of that, when it started like breaking people's phones and like, like locking up and stuff, I know OnePlus, which to be fair, that's a whole other can of worms. Cause they're currently merging the merging OxygenOS. - OxygenOS is, yeah, it's... - So there's clearly been some big problems, but that being said, there was basically no version of Android 12 which was a smooth rollout. Whether you're looking at Pixel or Samsung or OnePlus or whatever, it's also not just Android that's having these problems, right? Apple is on a very similar cadence where they release a new version of iOS and iPadOS and Mac iOS and watchOS and tvOS every year. Even if they're not necessarily these massive upgrades to do. Now, look, I am a hundred percent a supporter of constantly making software better. But when companies are locked to a yearly release cycle, it means that we get features that come late, we get features that may be, don't even get, make the release at all. And have to be pushed a whole year. Whereas if you look at Microsoft, I think they actually do a better job because there are Windows updates, that yeah, there are a couple of big Windows updates per year, but there's a little bit of a squishy timeline and it's not like Android where we're going from 10 to 11 to 12 of these huge updates. They just kind of slowly iterate, which you think is a, probably a more stable, a more. - It's just a perception thing. Like when you say, oh, we have a brand new OS like this. - Yeah. - People expect big new features every time, which they're not delivering in every OS. - Android 12 is a big update. - Yeah. - If it, works. - I mean, they're not delivering in every OS. - Sure, sure, sure. Android 13, I'm sure next year is going to be like, it's got like three new features and you know, whatever. - You know, say like, okay, we're going to start releasing updates like every other year or, you know, having bigger cycles where we can say, we're going to add some stability, some features, and you kind of like slowly roll that out over the next couple of years, which is already what they're doing. Again, when you're saying I want to go from 11 to 12, that means I want a lot more, I want, like a overhaul. I want to redesign. - But, I guess the Flip side to this, specifically on the Android front, is that because, sort of OEMs and everyone, they kind of, you know, you're not just making Android and shipping it. You know, you're making Android and you ship it to Samsung who then makes their own thing. - Right. - And then they have their own cadences and stuff. Everyone's kind of used to this is the way things go, right, and if Google decides that, hey, we're gonna start releasing Android at a slower cadence or something that is going to have a big ripple effect. And ultimately Samsung is going to make their, you know, 1UI 4.0, whatever time they want to release their new phone. There's a lot of room for things to get a little bit messy if, because I think for Apple... - Oh, there's tons of variables for it. Okay, Google says, we're going to release this new version of Android. - Yeah. - Then it's, like you say, when does Samsung released their version of that with their skin? - Exactly. - When is carriers going to roll that out? Because it's never day one. - Because Apple is making the software, they shipped to all their devices, the end, right. Microsoft, same kind of thing, right? They make a new version of Windows. They push the updates out whenever they really feel like it. No one really has a lot of say in that. Whereas there's a lot of cooks in the kitchen on the Android. - The whole appeal of Pixel, is it kind of bypasses all of that. I know it'd be like a weird PR move to say like, okay, we're not gonna start releasing features every year. - Yeah. - But I think like, I think that would be better overall because again, it's not going to be really anything. nothing's going to change, because they don't do these major overhauls every year, no company does. - Well, the Flip side to this though, is just being a little less ambitious with things. - Yeah. - Like Android 12 is a huge update, And, you know, especially when you pair a huge update with not as much time to work on it, that's a recipe for disaster, right? But if you think about it as like, okay, look, we're running Android, we're like saying, okay, we're going to ship something every year. I think it may just be, hey, don't be quite so ambitious with how much stuff you try to cram in that update because everyone's trying frantically to, you know, bring it to all these different devices. And there's so much involved in it. And it makes sense to have, you know, everyone expects that, you know, July or June or May, or whenever they decide to do it, hey, look, here's the next version we've got to start working on, but maybe it's not quite as big of an update like this. I think we've run into enough sort of buggy issues that that's not really acceptable, right? I think maybe bringing a little bit less ambition there and just look, it doesn't make it for this year, just roll it to next year, it's fine. It kind of is what it is. 'Cause I don't think people are willing to accept such a buggy experience, especially on the Google branded phone, right, like this is what you buy when you want like that clean software. And now they put so much money into building the chips and making the, sort of, overall, kind of like, super phone package, the last thing you want, if you're, you know, Sundar Pichai, sitting on your Google throne looking down, is like, oh, Marquez is tweeting that he stopped using the Pixel because it's buggy, that's a big deal. And they should try to avoid that if at all possible. - Here's where it gets muddier, too. Do you think it's a priority for them to get 12 on A and J lines, or do you think all of the resources are getting to having a more stable 12 on... - Oh, 100% - On the S, like, - So now, like if you don't have a flagship, now, you have to wait that much longer to get the latest update, because we're trying to catch up with these buggies. - That I 100% agree with. Now, the way I understand the Samsung, sort of updates sort of hierarchy is that they, sort of develop their 1UI and the new version of Android together on their flagships. You think, like the Z Flip the fold, the S21, what have you, and then once they've got that up and running and it's shipped, and it's stable, then they sort of port that down a line and down a line and sort of, check their boxes right up into the point where the new version of Android comes out and then they go back to the top and they do it again, which I don't think is crazy. I mean, obviously it would be nice, if we lived in a world like Apple where, you know, the version of iOS comes out for everything from a 6S on. - Which, it's much easier for Apple to do that. Because again, they control the entire pipeline. - And they also spend an enormous amount of money doing that. It's on one hand, you don't want to argue against improving. You don't want to argue against, like hey, stop making so many things, but also there's pretty much no argument for Pixels or Samsung or OnePlus, or what have you, to be shipping updates that are subpar. I would rather get it later than potentially break my phone or lose bugginess or whatever. That's not a trade off, like, I know we want these things to come out faster. I also don't want my phone to crash and burn spectacularly. So I get that there is a trade off here. It would just be nice that there's a little more cohesion where it's like, hey, we're shipping reasonable updates. - That can actually work. - That's why I think though, it's somewhere in the middle of just like, okay, you know, we're on maybe like an 18 month cycle. We have a little extra time to get those, get those features out, get them going. It's just more, I think the yearly thing is just more of a stockholder business thing, it looks way better to the stockholder. It looks way better to your SMP, if you are releasing, you know, a yearly thing, that's why Apple does these grand things every year. It's because it looks great. - Yeah. - You know, they always see... - It's part of marketing... - A spike, yeah, it looks good too to say, okay, yeah, we're putting this out. And if you just said like, okay, this is gonna be like an 18 month cycle or something like that, - Yeah. - which is exactly kind of, it seems to be, you know, that's when we, 18 months later, we have all the features. - It's between announcements. - Right, between from the date of announcement, to when it came out, it's about 18 months. I feel like people won't notice the extra six months there because they're not missing features that they thought they were going to get when they bought a phone. - It's not crazy, I still kind of feel like, I think they just need to be less ambitious with how much they're cramming - Yeah. - into each update to make sure that it just works when I get the damn update on my Pixel, or my Z Flip or whatever. but let us know what you think, in the comments below, and why we're Android, Apple, Microsoft shills all at the same time, somehow. - All simultaneously, - Simultaneously shilling for every update that's ever existed.

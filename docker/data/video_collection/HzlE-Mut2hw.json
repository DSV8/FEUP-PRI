    "transcript": "- Hey, it's Justine, and I am so hyped because as you know the new iPhone 15s are officially out in the world and so is iOS 17. And what's great about iOS 17 is it's not just new to the brand new iPhones, you can also get it on older devices as well. And I love iOS upgrades because it really does make your phone feel brand new. Now, let's go into some of the features that I've been loving so far. Standby has been awesome. You can scroll through different widgets, there's photos, it's super easy, you just scroll through. There's a bunch of different clock styles so you can choose whichever one you like the most. Standby works when your phone is plugged in and turned sideways and I love these MagSafe charging stands because it makes it so much more seamless. They have new contact posters, which allow you to create a custom contact image that'll be sent to anyone else who has iOS 17. And this way, this lets you control what image pops up on your phones because I know some of my friends right now have really awful photos of me which is kind of comical but now I can send them a really nice one. What I like about this is you can set up different contact pictures and photos and content within each contact poster to send to different people. So if there's someone who you may not want to have your phone number, you have the ability to send them a different contact poster that's specifically for that reason. I think these are really fun and it's a nice personal touch. Now, kind of going along with contact posters is name drop. You just have to bring your phones close to each other just like this, and automatically Tyler and I have shared our contacts with name drop. And again, each party can choose which contact poster and information that they wanna share, and if they don't wanna share, well you don't have to do that either. Oh, this one is one of my favorites. It's live voicemail. Now I don't like talking on the phone so I definitely get a lot of voicemails and yeah, it's cool that you can go back and see the voice transcriptions but what if it's actually really important? So now as they're leaving the voicemail this is all being transcribed in real time and you can choose to answer it if it seems like something that you want to talk about. Also, something to help beat spam is that if there's a call that's identified as like a scam number, Apple will automatically send that to voicemail and not transcribe it. So you don't actually have to worry about any car insurance scams, which is pretty nice. There's some new iMessage features like this swipe to reply. So when you swipe to the right this will allow you to reply in line to the text. So as you see here, I'm chatting with Tyler. He wants to know if we're still on for 8:00 AM but it's nine o'clock. He's getting a breakfast burrito, so I'm okay with that. I know this is really helpful because a lot of my friends will spam texts, and when I try to reply to a specific thing, this makes it really easy and it shows you exactly what you're replying to so there's no confusion whatsoever. We now have interactive widgets. Previously when you would tap a widget it would just open the app itself, you really couldn't do anything. It would just kind of serve you information and kind of just be a shortcut right to the app. But now they're actually interactive so you can do things inside of the widget like my to-do list. This now has improved autocorrect so when I type, it doesn't, it doesn't change it to duck. All jokes aside though, this is actually super helpful because there are a lot of times when it would autocorrect things either things that I have accidentally autocorrected and have inserted into the Siri system. Everything now just feels more cohesive. It doesn't feel like it's overly autocorrecting but of course my favorite feature is making stickers. The easiest way to do this is taking a live photo and here we go. Let's see, what should I do? (soft music) Yeah, that's great. That's really great. Now we take our live photo, we go into our stickers we add it as a sticker, and there it is. So I like that you can go into these and add different effects. So I can make it an outline, comic, puffy or shiny. Let's do a shiny stab. That's nice. There's another really cool feature called check-in which I really like. This is gonna be great for people to give a heads up of like, Hey, I'm on the way, here's my check-in. If you don't arrive at your destination you have the option to send your current location of where you are if your friend checks in, just in case something happens all that information will be there and it looks like I'm getting a check-in request from Tyler. Oh, he sent me a check-in. I'll receive a notification when he arrives home at 11:15. If they're delayed or their phone places an emergency SOS, you'll receive a notification of their location. So it looks like Tyler's on his way to Portland but he's in Los Angeles right now so he's gonna get there around 11:15 PM. So I don't know, we're not gonna wait around for that one. Okay, and the check-in has ended because Tyler decided that he's not actually going to be driving back to Portland right now. So there it is. This is a cool feature. They've now added access to offline maps so you're able to download a portion of the map and still get turned by turn directions and even search for restaurants or places within that vicinity. This is great if you're traveling abroad and you don't wanna use your cellular service. You can download the maps before you leave the hotel and you'll be able to still have those turn by turn directions and search for places you wanna visit. Oh, also you now no longer have to say, Hey when you wanna talk to our friend Siri I have so many Siri enabled devices here, like I don't even know which one answered. So a Siri from over there answered. It's also nice because now you can string multiple Siri requests without having to say Siri in between so it's a nice conversation between our friends. Siri, hope you have a nice day. - [Siri] Thanks. I hope you have a nice day too. - Oh, I'm touched. Siri, what's five plus five? - [Siri] Five plus five is ten. - Where can I find a math tutor? - [Siri] Here's what I found. - Do you wanna go to the mall later? She didn't like that one. So that's it for some of the iOS 17 features that I really like. Let me know what your favorites are in the comments below. If you wanna check out some more Apple videos you can do so here on the end screen. And of course, check out my YouTube channel for more, youtube.com/ijustine. Lots of more videos there for you to watch. See ya.",

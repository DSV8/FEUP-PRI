    "transcript": "today I'm going to compare a budget gaming laptop to something a little bit more aristocratic to try and answer the question are expensive gaming laptops actually worth [Music] it the budget gaming laptop for today's comparison is the cheapest gaming laptop that was available at my local Best Buy and I paid about $800 Canadian dollars for it it is this HP victus thing laptop names a weird victus could mean many things but this is one of them I guess but its cheapness isn't the only reason I found it interesting it's got like the loser version of the oligarch laptop's Hardware configuration in it which I think makes for an even more interesting comparison CPU wise we've got a ryzen 5 7535 HS in there and then the GPU is an RTX 2050 a budget gaming laptop GPU I haven't really seen around much but I'm pretty interested to check out it may be interesting enough to Warrant its own dedicated video but we'll see how it goes later in the video performance- wise the rest of the specs aren't great we've just got 8 gigs of RAM which really isn't a lot for gaming these days and they don't mention the refresh rate of the display which that's a little bit concerning now when it comes to the big boy gaming laptop Asus Canada very kindly sent over one of their new zephrus G14 gaming laptops which according to the Asus e store costs $2,200 which is quite a lot more than $600 for a gaming laptop and for our significant additional investment CPU wise it comes with a ryzen 9 8945 HS an 8 core 16 thread monster of a CPU I recently had a look at the previous generation version of it which is basically the same CPU in a Mini PC and it destroyed benchmarks real powerful chip which is paired with an RTX 470 so just there we've already got way more power than the little HP laptop we also get more RAM and storage but one of the real interesting things is the display in the G14 ooh the display in the G14 which we'll get to a little bit later so with that let's get to what I guess is the second category of comparison how much better build quality are you getting from a $2,200 laptop compared to a $600 one now it's pretty easy to summarize the build quality difference between these two laptops when you open up the HP for the first time you go kind of like o whereas with the Asus it's like ooh there's something about the combination of metal in the build the glass in the display and the weight of the hinge that when you open this little zephrus with one hand it is a borderline erotic experience it doesn't have quite the same H in a volcano by Tahitian virgins for the God's Vibe of a Macbook but it's not super far off now don't get me wrong the build quality on the little HP is fine for a budget gaming laptop it's all plastic as is expected for this price point but it's the kind of plastics that make you question whether or not plastic actually isn't biodegradable very scratchy materials that feel like they're not going to last a super long time but it passes the oneand open test yeah like I said for its price point the build quality is completely acceptable it's just that metal and glass are always going to win out over plastic and every time you interact with the little zephrus it's just it's just so nice if quite difficult to keep clean it's quite fingerprint now the Keen eyed of you probably would have noticed that there's a size difference between the two the little Asus laptop is 14 in whereas the HP is 15.6 and for that extra size you're getting a dedicated numpad on the keyboard of the HP and the keyboard on the HP laptop's fine it it is a serviceable laptop keyboard the same goes for the trackpad it's fine in fact the trackpad is the same size as the one on the zepherus although the zephrus one it's just got more satisfying clicks it's a nice trackpad I like it uh the keyboard is also just a solid laptop keyboard it's nothing particularly special but the most important thing we get for our additional $1,600 is a dedicated power button that's like in a funky triangle shape as opposed to a power button that's just hidden among the F Keys another important point of comparison is I/O where for all of your extra money you're getting an additional type c port and for some reason losing a full sized SD card slot I don't know why but this just has a Micro SD card slot on it which is something that annoys me for some reason however the Asus does have a huge Advantage most of its important IO is on the left hand side of the device which means you can plug a whole bunch of stuff into it without cables getting in the way of your mouse hand whereas with the HP laptop the HDMI port and the ethernet is on the right hand side of the device which is a real pet peeve of mine with laptops cuz it it just gets cluttered on the side your mouse needs to be very annoying webcam wise there's a very big difference between these two laptops we'll also hear what the microphone sounds like on them for like web calls and stuff but in this quite difficult lighting situation I look all bright and stuff on the zephrus whereas I look very just so flat surprise surprise a lot more money gets you way better laptop speakers on the HP laptop the speakers sound like they're trying to attack you with a tin B whereas they are very usable on the Asus laptop it's almost as though having front firing speakers is a much better design decision than firing them straight down into the desk who would have seen that [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] coming got know that I'm better feel I'm trying and do what I want to sometimes on that song that I use there's like a bass guitar riff which the HP laptop can't even reproduce it's too low a frequency for it to make whereas the as's laptop it just does it confidently no problem very good speakers on this laptop next we need to diagnose what strains of herpes these laptops come pre-infected with and I don't think any of you would be surprised that both these systems are as diseased as the the communal PC at the local nursing home the most common strain maafi is ever present but both these laptops have a whole Suite of software that launches every time you boot it slowing down that process quite a lot and yeah they barely have enough RAM just to load all the bloatware on them you really have to do a fresh Windows install on pretty much any gaming laptop cuz the manufacturers really load them down with crap but with that before we get to the gaming performance I do want to talk about the displays on these laptops because the 14-in high resolution OLED in the zephrus does things to my undercarriage the combination of the Absurd measurements with the inky black levels of OLED and the glass front which isn't prohibitively reflective on this display it is just beautiful but you also get 120 HZ and some of the best motion rendering now in terms of shortcomings it's not quite bright enough to Blind you which I personally think is kind of overrated and OLED does also have burin concerns but those are my minor quibbles for a magnificent display whereas in comparison the HP display just spits straight in your retina now it may be 1080p so it's reasonably sharp but it looks and measures like butt cheeks and it's only 60 HZ although um you'll see that hardware-wise maybe the 60 HZ display kind of makes sense performance-wise both these laptops have their issues I'd say the HPS is maybe a bit bigger considering that it runs games a little bit like it's got asthma during hay fever season but again it's a lot cheaper so maybe it's more excusable I don't know let's see starting with Battlefield 5 at 1080p High settings obviously the HP gets dumpstered by the Asus the Asus costs almost four times as much but considering the 4070 in the Asus this is not running great and I think the culprit is the power limit it's just drawing 50 Watts Which is less than half I've seen a draw in other gaming laptops now you can go into Armory crate and crank everything to Ultimate which doesn't do much aside from improve the 1% lows which is welcome considering how stuttery the gaming experience was and remember this laptop doesn't have a 1080p display in it and when you crank the resolution to Native you lose way more performance and it's not like in exchange you get a quiet gaming experience the laptop's still howling like a bonobo on [Applause] heat interestingly the HP was running a decent bit quieter but it was much closer to spontaneous combustion moving over to CS2 we've got a similar performance gap between the two but because of the much higher frame rate things are looking better I guess for the HP but it still has a 60 her panel so Esports titles don't feel great on it with a more demanding game like cyberpunk at 1080p High settings the Asus laptop starts to extend its lead quite a bit granted these are quite Aggressive Graphics settings for a budget laptop but it helps helps illustrate the performance difference between the two interestingly on the fancy boy going from 1080p to its native resolution cost you about half your frame rate and when it comes to the temperatures and noise you can really see why they had to Shackle that 4070 and finally The Last of Us straight up refuses to associate with the budget laptop because of the whole Ram situation when it comes to CPU performance you're gaining over 3,000 cinebench multi-core points for your extra money and a decent Step Up in single core performance which I wasn't really expecting to this extent but with that let's get to one of the final points of comparison upgradeability both laptops are relatively straightforward to get into and conveniently both of them also have their own Quirk the final tug on the HP feels like you're shattering some of its vertebra oh and the Asus has its final two screws hidden under some little rubber grommy things yeah they do that very fun thing where a hide screws under little rubber grommets oh oh no so the only things that are upgradable in here is the storage but there's just a single m.2 slot which I guess is forgivable for the form factor uh then we can also replace the Wi-Fi card and the battery looks pretty easy to deal with but the RAM is soldered down Asus come on I get it it's a thin laptop but i' take a couple of millimeters for Ram upgradeability any day of the week 16 gigs isn't enough for a device like this so if you are going to buy one I would definitely go for the 32 gig one but then you're stuck with 32 gigs now moving over to the HP first thing wow that is a tiny battery and look at that we've got socketed Ram although having said that it would have been a much bigger problem if they just soldered 8 gigs of RAM to it as opposed to the 16 gigs of RAM on the Asus laptop at least 16 is usable for gaming so after that comparison do I think that expensive gaming laptops are actually worth it now I'm going to start off with a little bit of a non-answer value is very subjective what's worth it to somebody may not be worth it to somebody else and if you can afford the thing obviously plays a huge role budget laptops exist for a reason and there are a lot of very good ones out there having said that if you can comfortably afford a high-end gaming laptop there is a lot of nice things about them this Asus zephrus is a beautiful device although I have not forgiven Asus for soldering Ram down onto it again I understand the form factor but why do you have to do stuff like that naughty Asus anyway moving on a nice gaming laptop is just so nice to interact with and I feel like within reason high-end gaming laptops are some of the tech things that do more to justify their price premium even if they do still howl like a jet engine under load I don't know let me know what you think about that in the comment section down below from your personal experience and let me know if you want to see more is expensive thing really worth it videos I really enjoyed making this comparison so subscribe to the channel Channel if you want to see that oh and also for the next video I'm going to have a closer look at the rate racing performance of the RTX 2050 in this budget laptop and with that I think we're done thank you again Asus Canada for sending over the zephrus and until the next video [Music] bye-bye he",

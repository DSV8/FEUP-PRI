    "transcript": "This is an iPhone 15. One of the advantages to an iPhone 15 is that you get a USB port on the phone and you could use a standard USB cable as an example to charge your phone or connect it to a computer. But here I've got three USB -C cables and they all look very very similar one of them however is an O.MG cable. This cable has a built-in access point so I can connect to it remotely using Wi-Fi. It acts like a charging cable notice however what I can do on this phone and this has been tested up to a mile away I can connect to the Wi-Fi access point running within this cable and then open up a web browser to the web server running within the cable and what I can do now as an example is load a script from storage on the cable. I'm not going to touch the phone now but I'm going to press build and run and what you'll notice is the phone suddenly does something.",

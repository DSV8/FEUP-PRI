    "transcript": "I've gotten so fed up with streaming that I've started to collect DVDs. Over the past several months, we've been dealing with seemingly endless price hikes from Netflix, Disney Plus, and Hulu and I've been struggling to find something that I actually want to watch. I've resorted to picking out my next flick from a pile of DVDs instead. It offers a whole bunch of DVDs for just $5 ranging from newer films like The Super Mario Bros. movie to older ones like Transformers and before you even ask, no, I don't really care about the crummy DVD quality when I play these movies in my PlayStation 4. I'll buy Blu-rays if a movie has stunning visual effects but for everything else, I really don't mind watching on DVDs. Sadly, Walmart's five-dollar DVD bin might not even be around in the near future. Best Buy has already confirmed that it's going to stop selling DVDs this year and Walmart might not be that far behind. It's 2024 Do you still collect DVDs or is it just me? Let us know in the comments.",
